A father who allegedly threw his five-year-old daughter to her death off a 60ft-high Florida bridge is mentally incompetent, according to two doctor evaluations.

John Jonchuck is accused of throwing his daughter Phoebe off the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in St. Petersburg last month.

After the doctors' statements were released this morning, court officials have said the competency hearing for Jonchuck will take place on February 17.

Police say John Jonchuck pulled over on the Sunshine Skyway bridge in St Petersburg January 8, pulled Phoebe from the back seat and dropped her to her death

Memorials have been set up in honor of the late Phoebe. Twelve hours before her death, a child welfare operator failed to pass along a message from Jonchuck's lawyer about his mental state because she didn't think the child was in danger

During the official hearing, attorneys can debate the meaning of the evaluations given thus far, which have not been made public, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Before the case proceeds, the judge needs to decide whether Jonchuck understands the case against him.

If he is ruled incompetent, he will be put into treatment and re-evaluated at a later date in hopes that treatment would make him mentally capable to stand trial.

Jonchuck’s history of mental-health issues has been raised as one of several warning signs outlined in a Department of Children and Families (DCF) report, according to Fox Tampa Bay.

The department revealed that it had received several calls from Jonchuck’s divorce lawyer regarding his mental state.

Just 12 hours before he allegedly threw his daughter to her death, his own lawyer called a state child abuse hotline warning that his client was suffering from mental delusions.

But according to documents released by child welfare officials on Monday, the hotline operator failed to pass on the call to investigators because she didn't think the child was in danger.

 One week prior to the lawyer's call, another worried caller told the Department of Children and Families that Jonchuck's daughter Phoebe had been physically abused in the past

One week earlier, another worried caller told the Department of Children and Families that Jonchuck's daughter Phoebe had been physically abused in the past.

That call, however, also failed to get to DCF investigators because the operator hung up before she got John Jonchuck's address. Instead of calling back, she simply closed the case, according to the state's investigation.

The lapses have cast the already troubled DCF in a harsh spotlight, prompting new Secretary Mike Carroll to change hotline protocol.

Going forward, if a caregiver seems to be experiencing a psychotic episode, a child protective investigator will be required to visit within four hours.

Police say Phoebe Jonchuck was likely alive when her father sped past a police officer January 8, stopped on the Sunshine Skyway bridge in St Petersburg, pulled the girl from the back seat and dropped her to her death.

He was arrested and accused of first-degree murder, but hasn't formally been charged as he is undergoing mental health evaluations.

Jonchuck's own divorce lawyer had warned authorities of his mental state January 7, telling the hotline operator that Jonchuck had driven to three different churches in his pajamas with Phoebe in tow and asked his attorney to translate a Swedish Bible into English.

Jonchuck was also expressing paranoid fears that Phoebe was not his biological daughter, his lawyer said.

'He's calling the office every five minutes and saying these religious things and saying the child might not be his, it just really concerns me,' the unidentified attorney told an operator, later adding, 'It's all craziness and it doesn't make any sense and he's out of his mind.'

But the report noted the relatively inexperienced operator said the caller seemed more worried about Jonchuck's mental state, not the child's safety and labeled the call as 'inadequate supervision' and did not turn it over to investigators.

The attorney even noted that DCF had an open investigation on the family, but the operator said she couldn't find the report and did not ask a supervisor, according to the state's investigation.

The missing report came from a caller who alleged family violence, inadequate supervision and substance misuse at the Jonchuck home.

'We are reminded yet again that every process within our system should be critically examined at every opportunity to ensure that the role it plays is carried out effectively,' Carroll said in the report.

Ignoring calls has been a problem in the past and the hotline has undergone a multi-million dollar overhaul.

Among the other problems uncovered in the investigation of Phoebe's death, Hillsborough County Sheriff's child protective investigators had 25 vacancies and were overwhelmed by the high number of new cases.

Although the area has a network of nearby mental health, substance abuse and domestic violence resources, investigators don't routinely seek expert advice before closing cases, using the organizations only for referrals.

Investigators also seemed more focused on whether Phoebe and her siblings' basic needs were being met, instead of addressing the histories of domestic violence, mental health, and substance abuse issues in the home, according to the report.

DCF investigators have struggled over the years to look at the big picture in several other high-profile child abuse deaths.

A call in June of 2013 first brought child investigators to the Jonchuck home where they closed the case, agreeing that family violence threatened Phoebe.

Jonchuck was arrested as a result of the call after an altercation with Phoebe's mother.

He and Phoebe later moved out of the home, but Monday's report noted that no services or interventions were put in place.
