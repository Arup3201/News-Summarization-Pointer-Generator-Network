The U.S. government is tapping communications from all around the world using international undersea cables, it has been revealed.

In another top-secret National Security Agency slide exposing the even wider reach of the government's intelligence programs, a crude map shows the extensive cable network that carries a huge amount of the world's voice and internet traffic from either side of North America and onto the rest of the globe.

At the top of the slide in large letters the word 'Upstream' is written, with the description: 'Collection of communications on fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past' and the code names Fairview, Stormbrew, Blarney and Oakstar.

Underneath, 'PRISM' is written, showing the eavesdropping on cables runs in parallel with the spying on technology giants such as Google and Yahoo that was blown open by whistleblower Edward Snowden.

An arrow on the left points to each with the caption, telling NSA staffers: 'You Should Use both.'

The overall heading of the slide, published for the first time today by The Washington Post, is 'FAA 702 Operations,' which refers to a 2008 law that allowed collection on U.S. soil for foreign intelligence purposes of communications of foreigners thought to be overseas without the need to get a warrant from a court.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence told The Sunday Post that legally authorized data collection 'has been one of our most important tools for the protection of the nation's - and our allies' - security. Our use of these authorities has been properly classified to maximize the potential for effective collection against foreign terrorists and other adversaries.'

It added that the intelligence and law enforcement communities would continue to work will all members of Congress to ensure a proper balance is struck between privacy and protection for citizens.

It is not known how many American's emails or phone calls have been monitored because they are communicating with a potential foreign target.

The world's hundreds of undersea cables, many of which lie across the ocean floor, now carry 99 per cent of all intercontinental data including most international phone calls, The Post reports.
