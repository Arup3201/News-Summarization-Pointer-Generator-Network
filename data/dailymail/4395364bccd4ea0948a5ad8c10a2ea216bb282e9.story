Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone joked about the unrest in Bahrain that has left several dead and scores injured.

The Gulf state yesterday defied anti-government demonstrators to go ahead and stage its Grand Prix. Mr Ecclestone laughed off the clashes, saying: ‘You know what they say, there’s no such thing as bad publicity.’

The race track – 25 miles from the capital Manama – was heavily guarded by police with dogs and armoured vehicles after intensifying violence in recent days.

...But it's business as usual for Bernie: Despite the raging protests outside, inside the circuit, Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, left, was happy to joke around as the race got underway

Dead: Protestor, Salah Abbas Habib, 37, was found dead, north of the Bahraini capital on Saturday - his family claim he was beaten to death by police during a demonstration

But the event took place without 
incident.

Afterwards, Mr Ecclestone added: ‘We will be back here next 
year, and for many years after, because they do a first class job.’

Outside the Bahrain Grand Prix groups of masked protestors chanting anti-government slogans set piles of tyres ablaze and hurled Molotov cocktails into the air.

But it was business as usual inside the circuit at Sakhir as Sebastian Vettel held off Kimi Raikkonen to win the race.

It
 went ahead without any reported hiccups despite two days of mass 
protests that saw demonstrators demand the 'gaudy spectacle' so loved by the ruling family that crushed Arab Spring demonstrations last year, be cancelled.

The 'three days of rage' began on Friday when up to 7,000 people clashed with 
police and troops armed with tear gas and stun grenades who were 
guarding roads around the ‘locked down’ capital Manama.

Tensions ahead of yesterday's race intensified after a protestor, 
37-year-old Salah Abbas Habib, was found dead, north of the Bahraini 
capital. Mr Habib's family claim he was beaten to death by 
police.

Formula One has been a symbol of pride for the 
ruling royal family since Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad 
al-Khalifa brought the first Grand Prix to the region in 
2004.

The luxury sporting event is the 
government's chance to prove that life has gone back to normal in the 
island kingdom after security concerns over anti-government 
demonstrations forced last year's race to be cancelled.

Women in garish outfits wearing 
feathered headdresses and dripping in jewels were paraded in front of 
the press, while Mr Ecclestone posed with a woman dressed as a clown and shared a joke with Bahraini Crown Prince Sheik Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa.

Mr Ecclestone had insisted all weekend that he had no intention of axing the race despite fears for the drivers' safety in the troubled Gulf state.

He even called for 'an earthquake or something like that' to detract attention away from the event.

He said: 'I can’t call this race off. Nothing to do with us. We have an agreement to be here and we’re here.

'The national sporting authority in 
this country can call the race off. There are other countries much 
higher up the priority list you guys should be writing about. Go to 
Syria and write about some of the things there because that is more 
important than here.

'What we really need is an earthquake or something like that now so you can write about that.'

King
 Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, who was at yesterday's race, said in a 
statement on Saturday that he wanted 'to make clear my personal commitment
 to reform and reconciliation in our great country. The door is always 
open for sincere dialogue amongst all our people.'

But the protestors see it differently. One, Ahmed Madani said during a demonstration on Saturday: 'Our 
initial demands were to elect a new government but after the disgusting 
abuse we received, all the people are asking for is for the regime to 
fall.'

Bahrain,
 a close military ally of the United States, is the only one of the Gulf
 monarchies to have been seriously threatened by Arab Spring protests 
that brought down the rulers of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen since 
the start of 2011.

World champion Vettel said on Thursday that he thought much of what was 
being reported about the riots was hype.

He added that he was looking forward 
to getting in the car and dealing with the 'stuff that really matters - 
tyre temperatures, cars'.

But the nightly TV images of streets 
ablaze with clouds of smoke and teargas have been an embarrassment for Formula
 One and the global brands that lavish it with sponsorship. Thomson 
Reuters, parent company of Reuters, is a sponsor of the Williams Formula
 One team.

Jean Todt, president of Formula One's governing body, the International Automobile Federation, broke a media silence yesterday to say he was sorry 'about what has been reported'.

'I am not sure that all that has been reported corresponds to the reality of what is happening in this country, he added.

The Bahrain government says it has 
enacted reforms after cracking down on demonstrators last year while 
revolts were sweeping across the Arab world.

Bahrain's
 government is thought to have spent $40 million to host the event. 
While motor sports journalists were invited to cover it, reporters from 
Reuters and some other news organisations who normally write about 
Middle East politics were denied visas.

Hackers brought down the F1 website 
intermittently on Friday and defaced another site, f1-racers.net, to 
support what they described as the Bahraini people's struggle against 
oppression.

The race has drawn more than 100,000 visitors and generated over $500 million in spending.

The continued hunger strike of Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, one of 14 men jailed for leading last year's uprising, is further inflaming the street and his health has entered a critical stage after more than 70 days. His family says he stopped taking water on Friday, raising fears for his life.

The Interior Ministry said yesterday via Twitter that Khawaja was in 'good health'. Khawaja is due to meet the ambassador from Denmark, where he also holds citizenship, which has asked for Khawaja to be released into their care.
