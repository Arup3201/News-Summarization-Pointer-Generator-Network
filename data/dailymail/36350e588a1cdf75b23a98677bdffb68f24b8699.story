Carole White is widely considered to be the most successful model agent in the world. 

The  64-year-old founder of Premier Model Management managed some of the biggest supermodels of the nineties, including Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer and Linda Evangelista. 

But despite the UK providing some of the best talent of the era, Carole claims that the country is unlikely to be responsible for creating any more of the top names in the industry because we're lazy and eat too much.

At that time, the supermodels could command up to £300,000 for a job according to Premier Model Management co-founder Carole White, who has now written a tell-all book about her experiences managing the most beautiful women in the world in the1990s 

She told Giles Hattersley from Sunday Times Style magazine: 'The British are s**t. Even if they're from a poor background, British girls have everything.

'They come from, say, Newcastle, and they don't want to leave their mates or their boyfriend — they're torn.

'(And) We're not as fit. Maybe we eat too much.' 

The Londoner is equally dismissive of the likes of Kendall Jenner, who she classes as 'short', despite standing at 5ft 8ins tall. 

During the interview, Carole claims that Kim Kardashian's half-sister can hardly be classed as a model and claims her attraction lies simply in her famous name, because she gives the big fashion houses exposure.

As head of Premier Models, Carole has spent the last few decades looking after the world's most beautiful women, which is no easy feat.  

Her role was far more than just booking her clients into great advertising campaigns of catwalk shows, the the company she ran with her brother was responsible for pandering to their every whim. 

In her new book, 'Have I Said Too Much? My Life in and out of the Model Agency,' Carole reveals that she had to undergo a number of errands, including couriering sex toys to a suite at the Lanesborough hotel in central London late one night and sourcing llama curry for another woman as she was boarding a private jet in Milan. 

In another incident, Carole tells Style magazine about having to fly in special green candles for one model from a remote area in Tibet.

In 1990, one of Carole's clients Linda Evangelista claimed about her gang of supermodels: 'We don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day.' 

But Carole has now debunked that myth, revealing that the price for a supermodel to appear from underneath the duvet was sometimes 30 times that amount of money. 

In an advert for the new Vauxhall Corsa in 1992, Carole negotiated a deal for Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista and Naomi Campbell that us eye-watering even by today's standards - each woman was paid £300,000 for their part on the TV clip.  

But even for that amount of money, it was still a chore actually getting the girls out of bed. 

In an excerpt of her book shared with the magazine, Carole reveals that she used to pretend a photo-shoot was taking place two hours earlier than it was scheduled for as the models would always be at least that late getting out of bed.

After a while, she had to make the start-time three hours early as the women and twigged that they were being tricked and used to lie in even later. 

The one exception to this rule was Claudia Schiffer, who Carole says was always on time and her easiest client to work with.

Carole would also make sure that she held a set of keys to every hotel room her clients were in, so that she could physically drag them out of bed if necessary. 

She says in her new book: 'You learn to manage lateness with a series of updates (lies) to those concerned. “We are leaving the hotel” (still asleep, one hour late);

'“We’re in the car” (just out of bed, two hours late); “We’re in a traffic jam” (just got in the car, three hours late); “We broke down!” (almost there, really pushing our luck).'

The girls also used their tardiness as part of a competition with each other as they didn't want to be the first on set.
