In a move that will thrill fans and infuriate gay activists, the A&E network will air a super marathon of Duck Dynsasty over the holiday despite the controversy that surrounds the show.

Starting tomorrow afternoon and stretching on for over 11 hours, viewers can watch Phil Robertson and his Louisiana clan stroke their beards, bicker with their wives and of course hunt for ducks.

The decision will come as a slap to to those who supported the network's decision to suspend Robertson after anti-gay and racially insensitive remarks he made to GQ magazine--and years before in a 2010 sermon--made national headlines.

Bowing to pressure? A&E is set to rake in mountains of ad revenue as the network decides to air 11-hour Duck Dynasty marathon in spite of star Phil Robertson's anti-gay tirade

Those who support the decision say A&E is just giving fans what they want: more of one of the most popular reality shows ever.

'I think, honestly, it’s A&E trying to play both sides of the coin,' celebrity blogger Cate Meighan told Fox News. 'They’ve come out and not supported Phil’s statements… however they’re also looking at the backlash from the fans, and they have a huge amount of backlash from the fans.'

Robertson, the patriarch of the Louisiana clan on the reality show about hunting, fishing and domestic squabbles, was put on indefinite hiatus by A&E last week for his remarks to GQ magazine characterizing homosexuality as sinful behavior.

The network has previously said it was disappointed after reading Robertson's remarks, which it added were his personal views and did not reflect those of the network.

Civil rights groups GLAAD criticized 
the comments, but the 67-year-old Robertson also found supporters among 
Republican politicians and figures, such as former vice presidential 
candidate Sarah Palin, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and Texas Senator
 Ted Cruz, who all advocated Robertson's right to free speech.

The
 future of the popular series, which is scheduled to begin its 
previously taped fifth season on Jan. 15, is up in the air following 
Robertson's indefinite suspension and his family hinted that they would 
not participate without him.

We
 have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a 
family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch 
at the helm,' the family said in a statement on Thursday.

The standoff between the Robertson family and A&E has put big money in the balance as the impasse also threatens a vast array of "Duck Dynasty" licensed merchandise that has brought in some $400 million, according to Forbes magazine.

Duck Dynasty brand apparel and products, including camouflage bed sheets and reclining furniture, are sold at retailers such as Target and Walmart.

And some say it's that lucrative popularity that makes it nearly impossible for A&E to turn its back in the show.

The show's fourth season debuted in August to 11.8 million viewers, a record for a cable nonfiction series, A&E said.

It averages about 8 million viewers per episode and its Christmas special was most-watched non-sports cable program on U.S. television last week.

'It is really a money thing,' Meighan said. 'Unfortunately people are secondary...At the end of every single thing that we see it’s about the money and the advertising.'

The fifth season of the show, which includes episodes featuring Robertson, begins airing January 15.
