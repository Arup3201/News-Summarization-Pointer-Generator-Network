U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services waited less than one day to launch a hiring drive – seeking 1,000 new federal workers – after President Obama announced November 20 that he would act on his own to provide legal papers for millions of illegal immigrants.

A new USCIS facility in Crystal City, Virginia is poised to immediately begin implementing Obama's plan, far in advance of a Republican congressional takeover that had the potential to stop him or slow him down through legislators' 'power of the purse.'

'USCIS is taking steps to open a new operational center in Crystal City, a neighborhood in Arlington, Virginia, to accommodate about 1,000 full-time, permanent federal and contract employees in a variety of positions and grade levels,' the bulletin reads.

NOT MESSING AROUND: The Obama administration took less than a day to launch a massive hiring push after the president announced his executive actions to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants into US society

'The initial workload will include cases filed as a result of the executive actions on immigration announced on Nov. 20, 2014. Many job opportunities at the operational center will be announced in the coming days and please continue to monitor USAJOBS if you are interested.'

The bulletin lists 32 examples of job openings, each of which was posted online on November 21. 

They include a chief of staff who will earn between $124,995 and $157,100 per year, and program analysts who will earn more than $138,000. Jobs earmarked for recent college graduates start in the range of $34,415 to $55,421.

The White House did not respond to a question about how far in advance the decision was made to open the hiring floodgates.

USCIS similarly did not respond to a request for comment about how long its plan had been in the works. 

Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions blasted the administration on Wednesday for the move. 

'This facility is a clear symbol of the President’s defiance of the American people, their laws, and their Constitution,' Sessions said in a statement.'

'He is hiring federal employees to carry out a directive that violates the laws Congress has passed in order to foist on the nation laws Congress has repeatedly refused to pass.' 

Sessions warned, however, that a coming Republican majority in both the House and Senate could choke off the funds needed to pay 1,000 new salaries. 

'The president cannot spend money unless the Congress approves it,' he cautioned, 'and certainly the Congress should not approve funds for an illegal amnesty.' 

NOT AMUSED: Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, warned that Congress could choke off the funds needed to pay 1,000 new salaries at USCIS

Sessions has emerged as one of the Senate's loudest critics of Obama's immigration policy shift, calling it a job-killer as he predicts a flood of newly-legalized illegal immigrants will rush to displace citizens from scarce jobs. 

'This action will mean that American workers, their sons, their daughters, their parents, will now have to compete directly for jobs, wages, and benefits with millions of illegal immigrants,' he said Wednesday. 

Reached at his Senate Budget Committee office, Sessions communications chief Stephen Miller told MailOnline that 'every day this facility continues its lawless amnesty operations is another day an American loses his or her job, is another day an American doesn’t get the pay raise because lower-wage workers are available, is another day their tax bill is heavier because they’re funding illegal benefits for people who have no legal right to claim them.'
