A barrister-turned-farmer has been found dead with gunshot wounds less than three weeks after getting married.

Ben Hinchliff, 46, who gave up his job as a London lawyer to pursue his dream of working on the family farm, was found dead with gunshot wounds on Friday.

Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident on Nether Mill Farm in South Yorkshire.

It is the latest tragedy in the Hinchliff family.

His father was mid-50s when he died in 1995. In July 2011, his younger brother Adam suffered a fatal heart attack aged 43 at Silkstone Golf Club, near Barnsley.

Tragic: Ben Hinchliff, 46, married Emily three weeks ago in a church in Barnsley. He was found dead on Friday

Mr Hinchliff, who joined One Brick Court Chambers in Temple, London in 1993, took over running the farm following his brother's death - his brother had taken over following the death of their father.

He married his wife Emily at a village church in Barnsley at the end of last month.

With his sister, Rebecca Scott, 43, Ben Hinchliff owned racehorses and recently submitted a planning application to convert some of their farm buildings into 20 homes.

On Sunday his wife, who works at a poultry company, posted photographs of the couple together on Facebook - including one of their wedding and one on a beach.

Mr Hinchliff's wife and his sister Rebecca were too distressed to talk.

Barbara Beevers, whose late husband Barry was a farm manager for the Hinchliffs, said: 'Ben was a highly intelligent man who was always courteous, always pleasant, they were a lovely family.

'He always had a smile on his face, was always very friendly which is why all this has come as a huge shock. In short he was a lovely man.'

'Where his heart lay': Mr Hinchliff left his job in London to take over his family's Nether Mill Farm in Yorkshire

A family member, who did not want to be named, added: 'With his father dying and the death of his brother we seemed to have drifted apart.

'If I saw him locally we'd stop and talk. It's a personal tragedy and I don't want to say anything that would upset the rest of the family. I think they have had enough grief.'

A statement on the website of his former chambers said: 'Chambers is very sad to report the tragically early death of Ben Hinchliff, who was a tenant in these chambers between 1993 and 2002, when he left a busy and successful junior practice to run the family farm in Yorkshire where his heart truly lay.

'He will be remembered as a wonderful companion who brought warmth and colour to the lives of many. He will be enormously missed.'

An inquest was opened and adjourned in Sheffield on Tuesday.

A service of thanksgiving will be held at St. John's Church, Penistone on Tuesday.
