A massive 36 years of scientific data generated by Nasa’s Voyager spacecraft has been transformed into a powerful piece of piano music.

The melody was created by a talented musical manager at Geant, the pan-European data network, which claims to be the most advanced of its kind in the world and serves 50million research users at 10,000 institutions.

Launched in 1977, both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are now decommissioned but still record and send live data to Earth.

A very modern data-driven alternative to Gustav Holst's Planets suite: Orchestral work was created from 320,000 measurements taken by Voyager 1 and 2

To compose the spacecraft duet, 320,000 measurements were first selected from each spacecraft, at one hour intervals.

Dr Vicinanza used proton counts from the cosmic ray detector over the last 37 years from Voyager 1 and 2.

Then that data was converted into two very long melodies, each comprising 320,000 notes using different sampling frequencies, from a few KHz to 44.1 kHz.

The result of the conversion into waveform created a wide collection of audible sounds, lasting from just a few seconds to a few hours. 

He used different groups of instruments and different sound textures to represent the two spacecraft.

They continue to traverse different 
parts of the universe, billions of kilometres apart and Voyager 1 left 
our solar system last year.

Domenico
 Vicinanza, network services product manager at Geant, Cambridge, UK, who is also a 
trained musician with a PhD in physics, created the classical duet to 
find a new way to represent data through the use of high-speed networks utilised by scientific researchers.

He used proton counts from the cosmic ray detector as a basis for the composition.

'I
 wanted to compose a musical piece celebrating the Voyager 1 and 2 
together, so used the same measurements (proton counts from the cosmic 
ray detector over the last 36 years) from both spacecrafts, at the 
exactly same point of time, but at several billions of kilometres of 
distance one from the other,' said Dr Vicinanza.

'I used different groups of instruments and different sound textures to represent the two spacecraft, synchronising the measurements taken at the same time,' he added.

Here he talks about the composition at the Super Computing 2013 conference

To compose the duet, 320,000 measurements were first selected from each spacecraft, at one hour intervals.

Then that data was converted into two very long melodies, each comprising 320,000 notes using different sampling frequencies, from a few KHz to 44.1 kHz.

The result of the conversion into waveform created a wide collection of audible sounds, lasting from just a few seconds to a few hours.

Using the computing facilities at European Grid Infrastructure (EGI), Geant was able to create the duet live at the Nasa booth at the Super Computing 2013 conference in Denver.

The result is an up-tempo string and piano orchestral piece.

A massive 36 years of scientific data generated by Nasa's Voyager spacecraft has been transformed into a powerful piece of orchestral music. Voyager 1's current mission (illustrated) along with Voyager 2, is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond

While this project was created as an accessible way to demonstrate the benefits of networks to society, data sonification - representing data by means of sound signals – is increasingly used to accelerate scientific discovery, from epilepsy research to deep space discovery.

Dr Vicinanza said: ‘Analysing the melody is exactly the same as looking at data in a spreadsheet, but using the ear.

‘The information content is exactly the same: represented by regularities, patterns, changes, trends and peaks.  

‘In fact, data sonification makes it possible to get information about long-range regularities and correlations that are hard to spot just by inspection.’

European scientists are generating an ever-increasing amount of data - for instance at Cern’s Large Hadron Collider – and Geant supports scientific projects so that researchers across Europe can use a super-fast network, which is the most advanced research network in the world.

Voyager 1 crossed a new frontier, becoming the first spacecraft ever to leave the solar system, it was reported in September of 2013.

Thirty-six years after it was launched from Earth on a tour of the outer planets, the plutonium-powered probe is more than 11 1/2 billion miles from the sun, cruising through what scientists call interstellar space — the vast, cold emptiness between the stars, the space agency said.

Voyager 1 actually made its exit more than a year ago, according to Nasa. But it's not as if there's a dotted boundary line out there or a signpost, and it was not until recently that the space agency had the evidence to convince it of what an outside research team had claimed last month: that the spacecraft had finally plowed through the hot plasma bubble surrounding the planets and escaped the sun's influence.

Voyager 1 now studies exotic particles and other phenomena in a never-before-explored part of the universe and radios the data back to Earth.

The interstellar ambassador also carries a gold-plated disc containing multicultural greetings, songs and photos, just in case it bumps into an intelligent species.

The music is based on 320,000 measurements taken by Voyager 1 and Voyager , which although decommissioned still send data back to Earth
