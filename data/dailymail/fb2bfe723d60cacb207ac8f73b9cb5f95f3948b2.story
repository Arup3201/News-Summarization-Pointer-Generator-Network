Mr Mitchell is suing News Group Newspapers (NGN) for libel over a story about his encounter with PC Toby Rowland on September 19 2012

A veteran police marksman has told of his disbelief at Andrew Mitchell’s ‘childish’ behaviour in Downing Street the night before the Plebgate incident.

PC Gareth Bonds was on duty when the MP demanded to be allowed to cycle through the main gate, a court heard.

Mr Mitchell allegedly shouted: ‘I’m the Government Chief Whip. I want to leave through these gates.’

In a written statement to the High Court, PC Bonds said: ‘During this exchange I stood and watched in disbelief at how childish a grown man in his position was being and found it embarrassing.

‘I therefore spoke to my colleagues and told them to just open the gates as it was ridiculous to argue over a gate. I found Mr Mitchell’s tone overbearing, but he did not swear at us.’

PC Bonds, who has been a policeman for 30 years, said the incident was the only one like it in his nine years with the Diplomatic Protection Group. ‘Most people are quite polite,’ he added.

The following evening – September 19, 2012 – Mr Mitchell again demanded to cycle through the main gate in Downing Street, but was refused.

He was alleged to have told officers: ‘Best you learn your f****** place, you don’t run this f****** Government, you’re f****** plebs.’

PC Toby Rowland  is in turn suing Mr Mitchell over statements he made from December 2012 which he claims accused him of fabricating his allegations

Mr Mitchell has always denied the comments but admitted saying, ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us.’

The 58-year-old Sutton Coldfield MP was forced to resign a month later from his position as Chief Whip.

PC Alex Jamieson, another officer on duty the night before the Plebgate row, said the MP became ‘agitated and refused to listen’ when he was asked to use the pedestrian gate.

He told the court such events were rare, but recalled an occasion when Labour minister Peter Mandelson ‘charged through the main gates about five years ago on foot’ because he was late for a meeting.

PC Jamieson added: ‘He was furious at being delayed for five minutes and when I explained that we were clearing two vehicles, he said he wasn’t having it and charged through on foot. The gates were already open to let a vehicle in and he wasn’t a security threat as I knew who he was, so I did not challenge him.’

Mr Mitchell is suing News Group Newspapers, publishers of The Sun, over the claim that he called officers ‘f****** plebs’. News Group Newspapers argues its article was substantially true.

PC Toby Rowland is suing the MP for suggesting that he made up the allegations. The case continues.
