A Norwegian artist and photographer has turned her talents to the breakfast table - with colourful results.

Ida Skivenes, from Oslo, has recreated Frida Kahlo with cheese and Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers with yoghurt and figs as she explores ways of brightening up breakfast.

She began posting pictures of her healthy and colourful meals on photo-sharing site Instagram in June last year where she has attracted more than 90,000 followers and bagged herself a book deal.

Ida Skivenes turned Frida Kahlo's Self Portrait, left, into toast using cheese slices, olives for the artist's eyebrows, kiwi fruit, strawberries and pears, while Van Gogh's Sunflowers, right, has a base of yoghurt and passionfruit curd as a canvas for apricots, raisins and figs

Peppers, cream cheese, celery and olives make The Scream, left, worth Munch-ing on, while Ida called her attempt at Jackson Pollock's Convergence 'feeble'

Ida Skivenes also tackled Salvador Dali's The Persistence of Memory, left, and enlisted granary toast and cheese to take on Piet Mondrian

Among her creations include a depiction of Little Red Riding Hood as well as the house from Disney Pixar film Up, with grapes for balloons.

Moby Dick is made out of a pancake and blueberries, while cream cheese, peppers and olives bring Edvard Munch's The Scream to the table.

Alongside foodie versions of great artists and literary figures are animals put together from Miss Skivenes' imagination, including lovebirds for Valentine's Day and a peacock with a tail made of satsumas, grapes and bananas fanning out behind it.

Each meal takes between five and 15 minutes to assemble before the start of her working day, with weekend breakfasts sometimes taking a bit longer.

Herman Melville's Moby Dick, left, is imagined with pancakes and blueberries, while half an apple and cheese were used for an attempt at Rene Magritte's The Son of Man

It isn't just works of art and literary figures that capture Miss Skivene's imagination: see her Valentine's Day lovebirds photo, left, and a proud peacock, right

And if you were worried that the mouth-watering artworks were a waste of perfectly good food, fret not.

Once they have been recorded on camera for posterity, Miss Skivenes tucks in to her morning meal.

On her Idafrosk blog, where she also posts recipes, she wrote: 'Anything else would be very wasteful and completely defer my main aim: to make tasty AND good looking meals.'

The creative breakfasts aren't just for show: after each one has had its photograph taken, Ida Skivenes eats them and heads off to work
