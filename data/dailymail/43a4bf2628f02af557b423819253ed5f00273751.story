The off-camera drama on The View continues with a new report detailing why executives at ABC decided to keep Rosie Perez on the daytime talk show. 

News of the network's decision leaked earlier this month before a formal announcement had been made while Perez was busy in rehearsal for her role in Larry David's new play Fish in the Dark, leading to immediate backlash not just from the public, but also Perez's good friend and View co-host Rosie O'Donnell.

Now, Perez will stay on the show with a source close to ABC executives claiming that the network wants to avoid 'an Ann Curry situation.'

ABC has reportedly decided to not fire Rosie Perez (above) from The View despite reports earlier this month that she would be ousted

Variety, who first broke the news of Perez's ousting from the talk show, reports that the actress may now stay on until August, when her contract is up.

The firing of Curry from Today in 2012 ended up being a disaster for the struggling NBC morning news show, with the longtime anchor's sudden departure and tearful farewell reflecting poorly on the once popular program and its cheerful and positive image.

ABC had reportedly hoped to avoid this by making it seem as if Perez was leaving the program because of her commitments to David's highly anticipated new play, which will begin previews in New York City on February 2.

The news broke however before they could even tell the other co-hosts,  and when O'Donnell confronted her bosses about what was happening the 'network backpedaled on the plan,' also concerned about the hit they might take for firing the Latina Perez just four months in and having not vetted any other candidates to replace her.

Perez will now return from her month off on February 3.

A spokesperson for ABC denied these reports, saying; 'These unnamed sources are wrong. As was always the plan, the amazingly talented Rosie Perez took time off to rehearse for her Broadway play. We’re eagerly looking forward to having her back on February 3rd. Any speculation to the contrary is simply untrue.'

The program continues to struggle in the ratings, and has begun to be outperformed by their CBS rival The Talk.

'It’s never been such a mess,' says one insider. 

'Nobody knows what’s going on.'
