The civil lawsuit against Florida polo millionaire John Goodman has been dropped, most likely because a settlement – rumoured to be in the tens of millions of dollars – has been reached with the victim’s parents.

Last week, Goodman, 48, was convicted of drunk-driving manslaughter that left a 23-year-old college student dead, and faces up to 30 years in prison at sentencing later this month.

Lili and William Wilson, parents of Scott Wilson, requested the case be dropped ‘with prejudice,' which usually means a settlement has been reached.

Polo tycoon: John Goodman faces 30 years in jail for the crash which happened when he was two times over the legal limit for driving. He has insisted the whole way through the trial he is innocent

While the court papers offer no hint of the settlement’s terms, both the Orlando Sun-Sentinel and the Palm Beach Post report that it is believed to be tens of millions of dollars.

Mr and Mrs Wilson’s attorneys, Christian Searcy and Scott Smith, told the Sun-Sentinel that they do not wish to comment on the settlement until Goodman is sentenced on April 30.

Goodman’s attorney Daniel Bachi declined comment.

News swirled the night before Goodman’s DUI trial that a settlement had been reached.

Last week, a jury Goodman guilty of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide in the 
February 12, 2010 crash that killed 23-year-old Scott Wilson.

Police say a drunken Goodman, the 
founder of the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Florida, rammed his
black Bentley convertible into Wilson's car two years ago, causing it 
to roll into a canal.

He left the scene and waited an hour to call 911 
while Scott drowned.

After the crash, Goodman's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 per cent, more than twice the legal driving limit.

Scott Wilson was only 23 years old when he was killed in the car crash

The tycoon took the stand at his 
trial on Wednesday to give his account of the night of the crash, when 
the impact overturned Scott's vehicle, sending it into a canal where 
the 23-year-old drowned.

'I don’t know what happened,' the International Polo Club founder claimed while on the stand.

But Goodman said he was sure of one thing: he had two shots of tequila and two shots of vodka before the crash, yet he was not drunk.

After leaving a bar, he said his car suddenly lurched forward into an intersection 'and I began to apply my brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used to,' he said.

Unable to control the vehicle, it slammed into the side of Scott's - even though Goodman said he was not aware he had hit another driver so left the scene.

If he had known someone had plunged into the canal, 'I would have done whatever I could have done to help', he claimed.

Goodman then went to a nearby barn where he found a bottle of liquor, the Miami Herald reported.

'I ... drank it to alleviate, thinking it would help with my pain,' he said, claiming it was the reason
his blood alcohol content was more than double the legal driving level 
when his blood was taken three hours after the crash.

Prosecutor Ellen Roberts probed why Goodman had failed to notice he had hit another vehicle. A 911 call played to the jurors revealed Goodman knew he had had a serious accident.

'It tore the daylights out of your car. It totaled it,' Roberts said. 'What did you think you hit?'

'I’d, I, did not know, I could’ve — I did not know what I hit,' Goodman stammered, the Herald reported.

Engineers for the prosecution and defence testified on whether the system controlling the millionaire's Bentley engine throttle could have malfunctioned, leading to the crash.

Defense engineer Luka Serdar said there were several error 
codes on the computer system in Goodman’s Bentley - but that pressing the brakes would still have stopped the car.

For the prosecution, Tom Livernois said the damage 
to the engine throttle would have been caused by the crash itself, adding there there was no way the car suddenly 
accelerated before the collision.

Bill: The court is shown Goodman's receipt for drinks, allegedly bought for himself and others before the crash

Describing the smell of alcohol, the police officer told the court he had to let down the windows of his patrol car 'to let it just clear out'.

Robert, an emergency medical technician who was at the scene, agreed that Goodman appeared to have been drinking.

'I felt he had a couple of drinks. He stated that to us,' Perreault told the court, but added that he did not believe Goodman has consumed a large amount of alcohol.

Goodman's girlfriend, Heather Hutchins, 42, also testified last week to say Goodman told her he had been in an accident but did not mention a car malfunction or having a head injury.

Newest family member: Goodman, right, adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins last fall. The move means she is entitled to up to a third of his biological children's $300 million trust fund

In a stunning move last October, Goodman adopted Hutchins, entitling her to up to a third of his biological children's trust fund, worth $300million.

Circuit Judge Glenn Kelly had previously ruled that the trust funds set up for his two biological children were off-limits in the lawsuit, according to the Palm Beach Post.

The adoption papers state that Ms Hutchins, who has been dating the millionaire since 2009 and is now his legal child, is immediately entitled to at least a third of his trust.

The Wilsons' attorney, Scott Smith, told the Palm Beach Post that Goodman was attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets.

Goodman’s civil attorney Dan Bachi told MyFoxOrlando.com that the adoption was meant to secure the assets of his children and family investments, nothing more.

'It has nothing to do with the lawsuit currently pending against him,’ Mr Bachi said.

Wilson was a University of Central Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer at the time of the crash. He had been driving home to Wellington to visit his family when Goodman ran a stop sign.

The Wilsons have already settled privately with the Player’s Club, the bar in Wellington where Goodman had been drinking before the crash.

They claimed that the club was partially responsible for the crash because they served Goodman even though he was intoxicated.
