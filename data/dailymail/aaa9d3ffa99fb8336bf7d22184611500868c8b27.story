Britain's first male mother has already split from his gay partner – less than a year after the birth of their daughter.

'Stupidly we always said it wouldn't change our lives,' the partner, named Jason, told the Daily Mail. 'Obviously we had no idea.'

Jason had been with Paul – who was born a girl – for six months when he found out that they were expecting a child.

The former charity shop manager said 
he was 'shocked' to learn that artist Paul, who still has female 
reproductive organs, was pregnant as he had understood that he was 
taking testosterone pills, which made it virtually impossible to 
conceive.

Their 'little angel' was born in March
 last year but the strain of their unconventional set-up became too much
 and  25-year-old Jason walked out.

He said: 'Our relationship has ended 
in a bad way. We do not really speak to each other now but we are 
determined to do right by our daughter. She is one next week. She's 
already started walking and is growing up so quickly.'

Three months after meeting through a 
mutual friend, Jason and Paul – who has had his sex legally changed by a
 gender recognition certificate – moved in together in a flat in the 
North of England.

Recalling the moment 27-year-old Paul 
showed him a positive pregnancy test, Jason said: 'I was shocked and 
scared and didn't understand how it could have happened while he was 
taking his testosterone tablets, which he took to aid his masculine 
appearance.

'He had just been on holiday to 
Florida and he told me he had forgotten to take them. We were very much 
in love but the consequences were enormous. It would have been nice to 
have planned having a child together.'

Jason was with university graduate Paul throughout the birth, but says that things had started to 'go wrong' long before this.

'Paul had stopped taking his 
testosterone pills so his hormones were all over the place. He became 
more and more like a woman. He grew breasts, a baby bump and even 
started to smell differently.

'As a gay man, at times it felt like I
 was in a relationship I shouldn't really be in. I didn't want to upset 
him so I bottled up a lot of my feelings.'

Before their daughter's birth the 
couple had enjoyed an active social life, including holidays to London 
and Paris, but the strain and sleepless nights started to take their 
toll. 'I think our relationship changed too quickly from being new and 
exciting and always out with our friends to suddenly raising a child,' 
said Jason.

'Just leaving the house means making 
sure she's changed, warming the milk for a bottle, bringing along the 
dummy. Forget one of those things and you have to go back to the house. 
We ended up fighting constantly.'

The couple finally split after a 
stressful holiday together in September last year. 'Back home we fought 
badly one morning and I said I would be leaving when I got home from 
work,' said Jason.

'I picked our daughter up from nursery later and took her for a  little walk to say goodbye.'

Both Jason and Paul, which is not his 
real name, are keen to protect their daughter. Paul has previously said 
that he does not want his identity to be known as it is 'not something I
 want to become famous for'. He said: 'I do not want everyone to know 
that I am transgender.

'And I have to think of my daughter and I don't think it would be good for her.'

Jason added: 'Society is becoming more
 accepting. I am hoping that by the time our daughter has grown up, it 
won't be an issue but for now I want to protect her.

'I suffered discrimination when I was 
growing up because I'm gay, but times have changed. All that matters is 
that she's loved. We will support her through anything.'

Jason sees his daughter once a month but does not have a good relationship with Paul, who has resumed his testosterone pills.

'We are seeing a solicitor so that the
 details can be sorted,' he added. A blog written by Paul charted the 
early days of his pregnancy.

He wrote: 'I'm not the first man to 
have a baby and I won't be the last, but we're not fully accepted and 
understood yet, there's still a long way to go.

'But if there's one thing I've learned on my journey from being a girl to being a man, it's patience.'

Four years ago American Thomas Beatie,
 38, announced his pregnancy. He had been taking male hormones but, as 
he was married to a woman, he became pregnant using donor sperm after 
stopping the hormone therapy. He is now said to have given birth three 
times. Latest figures show that sex-change operations on the NHS tripled
 between 1999 and 2009.

More than 1,000 have had surgery, at a cost to the taxpayer of £10million.

Men wishing to become women make up 80 per cent of the cases.

In addition to surgery to correct 
their genitals and adapt their chest, transsexuals can also receive 
psychotherapy and hormone replacement therapy on the NHS.
