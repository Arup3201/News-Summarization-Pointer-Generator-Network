Chinese businessman Fu Chuang is not averse to branching out into something a bit different when he finishes work by heading to the local university to practise kung fu in a tree.

Mr Chuang, 37, said he found the martial art was the perfect way to relax and he claimed he taught himself from watching experts on the television and reading books.

He climbs the thin, bendy tree trunk before balancing and holding kung fu poses.

Balancing act: Fu Chuang practice skung fu in a tree in China. His heads to the local university campus after work each day

Self taught: Mr Chuang, 37, said he found the martial art was the perfect way to relax and he taught himself from books

Dedicated: Mr Chuang heads to the Hainan university campus every day after work to practice kung fu. He says he doesn't have room in his flat

Concentration: Mr Chuang balances perfectly on the thin tree trunk. He said he doesn't practice for fighting reasons

He said: 'I don't do it for fighting 
reasons, I do it to bring peace and harmony to my body and soul and as a
way of relaxing and getting away from the stress of work. I don't have 
room in my flat and so I came here to the park.

'At one point I tried some exercises balancing on the tree and found it really encourage me to concentrate and feel more in touch with the natural world which is important here in the city.'

Mr Chuang goes to the university campus at Hainan to practice the skill.

Kung fu, like most martial arts, requires balance and co-ordination.

There are lots of different styles that concentrate on fitness as well as meditation.
