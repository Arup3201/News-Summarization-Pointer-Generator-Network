Lord Steel, who introduced the 1967 Bill which legalised the practice, said it was 'thoroughly undesirable' that 36 per cent of terminations are now to those who have already had at least abortion

The father of the Abortion Act has spoken out to warn of the growing ‘problem’ of women having repeat terminations as an alternative to contraception.

Lord Steel, who introduced the 1967 Bill which legalised the practice, said it was ‘thoroughly undesirable’ that 36 per cent of terminations are now to those who have already had at least one abortion.

In a dramatic intervention, he said it was ‘never the purpose’ of his historic reform that tens of thousands of women would use abortion as a ‘form of contraception’.

The indication that the former Liberal leader, who brought forward his Bill when he was a young backbencher, now believes his legislation has gone too far seems set to reignite the debate over abortion.

Latest figures show that in 2011, there were 189,931 abortions, of which no fewer than 68,105 were on women who had already had a foetus terminated - a proportion of 36 per cent.

This compares to 64,303 repeat terminations the year before - a proportion of 34 per cent. Repeat abortions cost the cash-strapped NHS almost £1million every single week.

Lord Steel made his comments in the Lords last week during a question-and-answer session on abortion with health minister Earl Howe.

He asked the minister: ‘Will he confirm that there has been a welcome drop in the total number of abortions recently, but that there is still a problem of what are called repeat abortions, where women present who are clearly using abortion as a form of contraception, which is thoroughly undesirable?’

Earl Howe replied: ‘The abortion rate across England and Wales has been static since 2009. The good news is that the abortion rate for women under 18 has gone down. There was a 9.6 per cent decrease in the rate between 2010 and 2011.

‘On repeat abortions, the news is not so good. The proportion of repeat abortions for women who had abortions in 2011 was 36 per cent. The figure was higher than it had been the previous year, which is a matter for concern.’

The 2011 figures on repeat abortions show that many women are going back time and time again for terminations - a sign, according to Lord Steel, that they are being used as a form of contraception.

Some 17,241 women were on at least their third abortion; 434 were on at least their sixth and - astoundingly - 76 were on at least their eighth.

Speaking later to the Daily Mail, Lord Steel said: ‘It is odd that so many women present for repeat abortions, some more than twice, which does suggest they are treating abortion as contraception.‘This was never the purpose of the 1967 reform.’ 

Josephine Quintavalle, of the Pro-Life Alliance, said: ‘David Steel needs to face the reality of the provision of abortion in this country, that it is not just being provided for women in dramatic need but is available on demand.

‘It was verging on the ingenuous of him to imagine when he brought forward his legislation in 1967 that abortion wouldn’t end up being available on demand.

‘The trouble is that many people think there is nothing wrong with repeat abortions. They say: abortion is either right or wrong, so if you can have one you should be able to have as many as you can ask for.’ 

Ann Furedi, chief executive of abortion provider BPAS, said: ‘It is unfair to women and wrong for politicians to assume that women can live a modern life and not have the option of accessing abortion services.

‘Too many politicians - particularly as they get older- forget that abortion is a part of life. ‘ 

She said repeat terminations happen because ‘Women in their teens and their 20s are often very fertile and find it difficult to manage their fertility by contraception alone’.

‘Women are not using abortion simply as another method of birth control,’ she said.

‘What is happening is that contraception fails, or sometimes we fail to use it properly.

‘When abortion is legal and easily available, it is not surprising if women use it - and that is not a bad thing.’
