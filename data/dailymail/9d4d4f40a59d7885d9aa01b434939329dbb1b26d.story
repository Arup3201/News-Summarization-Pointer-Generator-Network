NHS bosses have been accused of trying to ‘cover up’ a mistake that delayed paramedics delivering potentially life-saving treatment to an eight-year-old boy who suffered a fatal asthma attack.

Clayton Barker started struggling for breath while suffering a serious asthmatic episode at his grand­mother’s house in Oldham on the evening of March 14 last year.

His grandmother immediately called 999 for medical help.

But an inquest was told on Thursday the operator mistakenly logged the call as a ‘green’ code case, which allows ambulance crews more time to reach a patient, rather than a ‘red’ coded life-threatening emergency.

The error meant that paramedics took 23 minutes to reach the schoolboy – arriving around six minutes after he died, despite efforts to resuscitate him by a family friend.

Last night, Clayton’s mother Gemma Barker accused North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) of trying to ‘cover up’ the mistakes made on the night of his death.

Her comments came after Angela Lee, acting manager of NWAS emergency centre, changed her evidence on the night before the inquest.

Mrs Lee originally submitted a statement to the coroner in June last year saying there were ‘no appro­priate resources’ to send when the call came in at 7.17pm.

And she said in a letter to Mrs Barker that no ambulance was ­available until one was eventually dispatched at 7.29.

But, on Wednesday, Mrs Lee said she wanted to change the NWAS statement because further study of its records showed a rapid response vehicle was ready at 7.21.

She said that, because Clayton’s grandmother’s call was wrongly coded green, this ambulance went to another less serious incident involving a toddler rather than Clayton.

Mrs Barker, 31, said: ‘When they sent me the letter in the first place they told me they had done all the investigating they could and that the conclusion they came to was that there were no other ambulances available. It does look suspect.

‘When she [Mrs Lee] came up with the extra evidence I just thought it does look like they’re trying to cover it up.’ The inquest was told that, if the ambulance available had been sent at 7.21 it could have reached Clayton by 7.27 or 7.28, offering paramedics a window of between six to eight minutes to treat his asthma attack before he collapsed.

But instead a team was sent just before 7.30, arriving at 7.40 – some six minutes after his heart stopped.

The inquest was told that the 999 operator, who has more than two years’ experience, misheard Clayton’s grandmother and thought she said he could speak between breaths, when in fact he could not.

Mrs Barker, who has two other sons, said she believed the delay in the paramedics’ arrival played a part in the death of Clayton, who had suffered seven serious asthma attacks previously and survived.

Offering her condolences to the family, Mrs Lee said the mis-coding of the call was a ‘tragic mistake’.

The inquest has been adjourned until next June so that medical experts can be called to determine whether earlier treatment could have saved Clayton’s life.

Mrs Barker’s lawyer, Zak Golom­beck, a clinical negligence expert from Slater and Gordon law firm, said: ‘On behalf of Gemma and her family, while the conclusion of  the inquest would have been pref­erable to allow for some closure, the Coroner has made the correct decision to adjourn and seek further evidence to ensure the inquiry will be as full and fearless as it should be.’
