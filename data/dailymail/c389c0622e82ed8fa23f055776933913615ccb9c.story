When Steve McClaren took charge of Derby County just a few days after Nigel Clough was sacked, the Rams were lying in 14th place in the Championship. That was three months ago. Today, the club are sitting comfortably in the play-off places. So, bring on Jose Mourinho and the Chelsea boys in the FA Cup on Sunday.

It's been some turnaround at the newly-renamed iPro Stadium. Here, NEIL MOXLEY at the reasons behind the Derby revolution...

There can be little doubt the arrival of the former England manager was received warmly by Derby County’s supporters. They remember fondly the input made by the Jim Smith’s assistant during the promotion push in 1995-96.

The situation he walked into, along with fellow ‘Derby men’ – assistant Paul Simpson and goalkeeping coach Eric Steele – was by no means terminal.

Derby were scoring plenty of goals. Indeed, they still are. What McClaren has done is tighten up the defence. The Rams have not conceded more than one goal in the league in the past two months.

They used to be vulnerable without possession. Now they scamper back into their shape quickly. McClaren may have been criticised in the past for not knowing how to win matches. But he has identified that not losing them will be key for Derby County.

Derby’s core strength lies in their engine-room of Craig Bryson, Will Hughes and Jeff Hendrick. Bryson, a £450,000 capture from Kilmarnock, has scored 11 goals from midfield. Unlike the last person to claim that feat for the Rams, Inigo Idiakez, he has done so by grabbing them from open play.

He has been ably supported by Hughes – a teenager who burst on to the scene under Nigel Clough and who may not have enjoyed the same impact this season as he did last, but he is still just 18 years of age.

And completing this trio is Hendrick. Another youngster with great promise who is just working his way back to full fitness after a three-month lay-off with an ankle problem.

Yes, every successful team is likely to boast one. And in Chris Martin, the Rams have a man who is bang on the money at the moment.

Martin was another whose talent was identified by Clough. However, he appears unfazed by the managerial change, having claimed 15 goals so far this season. Martin has also missed a couple of penalties, which would put him within sight of becoming the first Derby striker to score 20 goals in a season since Dean Sturridge in 1995-96, when the Rams were promoted.

Martin may not be the quickest but he is very good with his back to goal and adept at finding team-mates who are clever enough to find the space to receive the ball from him. Players such as those midfielders listed above.

John Eustace originally joined Derby with a view to earning a contract. He has become an important cog in the machine as he offers the protection that affords the likes of Hughes et al the licence to go on the rampage further upfield.

The ex-Coventry trainee was at Watford for five seasons and knows the Championship as well as anyone.

At the age of 34, he understands not only his role but his place within the team environment and McClaren has been canny enough to recognise and value his importance since taking over.

Derby have appointed a new chief executive, Sam Rush, a former agent with Wasserman whose decision it was to dispense with Clough’s services.

Many commentators – including this one – felt that it was harsh, given the financial constraints under which the former England forward had been working.

He put the building blocks of Derby's success so far this season in place and, to be fair to McClaren, he has repeatedly acknowledged this.

But any chief executive has tough decisions to make. Rush has overseen the re-branding of Pride Park and, at present, has to be in credit following McClaren’s appointment.

Legendary boss Brian Clough always regarded Derby as a true footballing town. So, who are we to argue?

That is borne out in the attendances. There has been little to shout about for the Rams during the past few years but their average crowd of 24,346 is the third largest in the Championship behind Leeds United and Brighton and Hove Albion.

It is a reflection of the fact that Derby had been banging in goals that it is just 1,000 better than the figure achieved under Clough.

Needless to say, the iPro Stadium will be packed out for the visit of Chelsea on Sunday.
