Likely Republican presidential contenders Marco Rubio and Rand Paul are already clashing over President Barack Obama's recently announced shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba.

Paul has said that lifting a more than 50 year embargo on Cuba is 'probably a good idea' while Rubio has swiftly made himself the face of opposition to normalizing relations with the Communist country.

The argument between the two Republican senators escalated last night when Florida Sen. Rubio, who is the son of Cuban immigrants, claimed that Kentucky Sen. Paul 'has no idea what he’s talking about' when it comes to his parents' home country.

Florida Senator Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is pictured here standing alongside Florida Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen during a press conference in Miami, Florida on Wednesday about the United States' decision to restore full diplomatic relations with Cuba and open an embassy in Havana for the first time in more than a half century. Rubio has taken a hardline stance against the issue

Paul has placed himself at odds with several possible Republican presidential challengers, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, also of Cuban descent, by aligning himself with the president and coming out in support of removing trade and travel restrictions on the Latin American country located less than 500 miles off the Florida coast.

'This announcement today will be remembered as a tragic mistake,' Cruz warned on Wednesday after Obama's announcement.

'Just like the administration did with Iran, right when the administration was feeling the maximum pain it throws them an economic lifeline and continues the brutal repression and dictatorship of the Castro brothers,' he said on Fox News. 

Likewise, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush wrote on Facebook that 'Cuba is a dictatorship with a disastrous human rights record, and now President Obama has rewarded those dictators. 

Bush became the first Republican candidate to officially acknowledge that he is exploring a presidential run earlier this week, just one day before Obama confirmed that his administration was reestablishing high-level diplomatic relations with Cuba.

The former governor of the state with the largest Cuban-American population called Obama's move a 'misstep' and argued that it 'undermines America's credibility and undermines the quest for a free and democratic Cuba.'

During a radio interview this week Paul said 'if the goal was regime change, [the embargo] sure doesn’t seem to be working.'

'Probably, it punishes the people more than the regime because the regime can blame the embargo for hardship,' he added.

Rubio fired back at Paul on The Kelly Report on Thursday night and said, 'Like many people who have been opining, he has no idea what he’s talking about. 

'Look, Venezuela's economy looks like Cuba's economy now,' he told the Fox News show's host, Megyn Kelly. 'You can't even buy toilet paper in Caracas. And there's no embargo on Venezuela. What Venezuela has in common with Cuba, is they both have adopted radical socialist governmental policies.

'And I would expect that people would understand that if they just took a moment to analyze that, they would realize that the embargo is not what's hurting the Cuban people,' he continued. 'It's the lack of freedom and the lack of competent leaders.'

Rubio tore into Kentucky Sen. Paul on Thursday night over Paul's decision to come out in support of the president's Cuba policy shift. Paul 'has no idea what he’s talking about,' Rubio accused

Rubio has said he will use his position on the Senate Foreign Relations committee to block the creation of a U.S. embassy in Cuba and will oppose the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo on the country, which only Congress can authorize. 

In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Rubio called Obama's decision 'a victory for oppressive governments the world over and will have real, negative consequences for the American people.'

Rubio argued that 'the opportunity for Cuba to normalize relations with the U.S. has always been there, but the Castro regime has never been interested in changing its ways.

'Now, thanks to President Obama’s concessions, the regime in Cuba won’t have to change,' he asserted.

He went on to say that the U.S. policy shift 'is based on the illusion—in fact, on the lie—that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the Cuban people.

'Cuba already enjoys access to commerce, money and goods from other nations, and yet the Cuban people are still not free. 

'They are not free because the regime—just as it does with every aspect of life—manipulates and controls to its own advantage all currency that flows into the island. More economic engagement with the U.S. means that the regime’s grip on power will be strengthened for decades to come—dashing the Cuban people’s hopes for freedom and democracy.'

The U.S. is the only country in the world that restricts interactions with Cuba. The White House told reporters this week that it has become clear in the last 53 years that the 'unilateral' embargo has not had the intended effect.

'The rest of the world is actually on the other side of this issue. They criticize our sanctions regime policy against Cuba and it actually interferes with our ability to bring to bear pressure from the rest of the international community on the Castro regime to better respect human rights,' the president's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said.

While high-profile Republicans are mostly aligned in their opposition to the White House's policy, polls taken this year on the issue show that Cuban-Americans in the the influential voting state of Florida share Paul's views as do the majority of Americans across the nation.

A Florida International University poll of Cuban-Americans in South Florida taken in June found that 68 percent of the demographic is in favor of reestablishing diplomatic ties with Cuba and 69 percent want travel restrictions eliminated.

A majority also said they were in favor of doing away with trade restrictions, 52 percent, and that the embargoes have not worked, 71 percent.

And nationally, majorities of Americans in both political parties support resuming relations with Cuba, a total of 56 percent, according to an Atlantic Council poll taken in February.
