Nigel Pearson's Leicester held Arsenal to a 1-1 draw at the King Power Stadium as the Gunners drew their second successive Premier League game. 

Find out how the players fared in the Barclays Premier League contest. 

LEICESTER 

KASPER SCHMEICHEL - 7

Not quite to the extent of his father but looks a real commanding presence in the area.

RICHIE DE LAET - 6.5

Given a hard time by Sanchez on occasions but kept to his task well. Solid enough display. 

PAUL KONCHESKY - 7

Showed plenty of energy down the left hand side for the home team. Experience was key.

Equaliser: Leonardo Ulloa's well-placed header beat Wojciech Szczesny to level the score at 1-1

WES MORGAN - 8

Towering presence in the heart of Leicester's defence. Embodiment of his manager. 

LIAM MOORE - 7.5

The defender's got a big future, dealt well with Sanogo's threat and looked comfortable.

DEAN HAMMOND - 7

Tireless display in midfield from the ex Southampton man. Wasn't overawed by Arsenal's quality.

ANDY KING - 7

Summed up Leicester's tenacious spirit. His work rate was invaluable for Nigel Pearson's side.

JEFFREY SCHLUPP - 7

His pace caused Arsenal problems throughout the afternoon. Will be a big player for the Foxes.

RIYAD MAHREZ - 6.5

Looked a real threat at times with the ball at his feet, but decision making could be better.

DAVE NUGENT - 6.5

Ran himself in to the ground for Leicester, but didn't have much impact going forward. 

LEONARDO ULLOA - 7.5

Took his goal very well and his physical presence caused Arsenal problems all afternoon. 

SUBS: 

Mark Albrighton (on for Mahrez, 65) - Took to the pace of the game instantly.

Jamie Vardy (on for Schlupp 70) - Added pace to Leicester's attack.

Danny Drinkwater (on for Ulloa 77) - Protected De Laet down the right during the closing stages.

Unused subs: Cambiasso, Hamer, Wasilewski, Wood. 

Chase: Leiceester City's Andy King tries to tug back former Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez

ARSENAL

WOJCIECH SZCZESNY - 7

His workload was minimal. Had little chance with Ulloa's well directed header. 

MATHIEU DEBUCHY - 6.5

Worked the right side well for the Gunners. Has settled in at Arsenal with very little fuss. 

NACHO MONREAL - 6.5

A solid enough display from the left-back, but Kieran Gibbs should be back in the side after the international break.

World Cup:  Mesut Ozil is still regaining full fitness after returning to Arsenal training late this summer

PER MERTESACKER - 6.5

Had his work cut out against Ulloa, but the World Cup winner's experience saw him through.

LAURENT KOSCIELNY - 6

Forced off early with a head injury, the decision for him not to come off earlier cost Arsenal. 

MATHIEU FLAMINI - 6.5

Swept up in midfield, but Arsenal need a bona-fide world class player in his position to challenge for the title. 

AARON RAMSEY - 7

A little sloppy in midfield at times but still looked dangerous breaking forward. 

Substitute: Calum Chambers came on in the first half after Laurent Koscielny went off with a head injury 

SANTI CAZORLA - 6.5

Probing and economical in possession, but couldn't unlock the door in a frustrating afternoon. 

MESUT OZIL - 6

On the peripheries of the match. Still doesn't look comfortable with the pace of English football.

ALEXIS SANCHEZ - 7.5

Arsenal's most potent attacking threat of the afternoon. Scored his first league goal, too. 

YAYA SANOGO - 5

No lack of effort, but simply not good enough to lead the line for a title chasing team. 

SUBS: 

Calum Chambers (on for Koscielny 26)- The new England recruit slotted seamlessly alongside Mertesacker at centre-back. 7

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (on for Cazorla 77) - Tried to inject energy into Arsenal's game. 6.5

Lukas Podolski (on for Sanogo 77) - Not enough time to make an impact. 5 

Unused subs: Rosicky, Wilshere, Martinez, Campbell.

Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire) - 6.5 

Forward: Yaya Sanogo deputised for the injured Olivier Giroud, but few were impressed with his peformance
