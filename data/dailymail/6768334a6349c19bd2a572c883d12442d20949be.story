A ski company is offering to pay fines of up to £700 to parents taking their children on holiday during term time.

MountainBase is advertising its skiing breaks in Morzine, in the French Alps, along with the slogan: 'Are schools in the UK taking the PISTE?'

It adds on its Facebook page: ‘We think so. Especially with record snow levels across Morzine and yet more snow due to land in the next few days to provide excellent piste conditions.

Offer: MountainBase promises on its Facebook page to pay fines issued to parents taking children on a ski holiday

Why can't you take your child on holiday in term time?Many schools used to give pupils authorised absences of up to ten days during term time.But in September Education Secretary Michael Gove banned the allowance in all but ‘exceptional circumstances’.

A maximum fine of £60 per pupil per parent can now be charged, rising to £120 if not paid within seven days. Refusal to pay can mean a fine of up to £2,500 and up to three years' jail.

Why do holiday firms increase prices?Travel
companies insist they are responding to demand. They make more money 
when demand peaks in the six-week summer holiday, which offsets smaller 
margins in low season.

They claim they trying to cap charges during school holidays will push up prices year round.

‘So we have a special offer... Book a week with children at MountainBase/Inferno we will if you receive a fine from your school/local authority pay the fine on copy of a receipt from yourselves.

'This is based on any booking in March/April except the free ski pass option.’

MountainBase owner Lee Quince defended the controversial deal.

Asked on BBC Radio 5 if he was being 'irresponsible', he said: ‘Yes, in one way but also the law has changed to specifically address truancy, especially in the wake of the riots.

‘In some sense that's affecting people who are not in that set, it's a law change not destined for themselves. They're doing an activity they're not able to do in the UK.’

It comes as figures reveal a 70 per cent rise from 2012 to 2013 in the number of parents issued with fines for taking their children on holiday during school term time.

New regulations were introduced by the government last September, stopping schools from allowing children 10 days a year leave for family breaks in ‘special circumstances’.

A maximum fine of £60 per pupil per parent can now be charged, rising to £120 if not paid within seven days. Refusal to pay can mean a fine of up to £2,500 and up to three years in jail.

A debate was held in parliament in February, after 170,000 signed a petition for action over the high prices of going away during school holidays.

A family holiday during half-terms can be twice as expensive as the week before.

Mr Quince said his company, which offers all-inclusive holidays starting at £199 per person in the off-peak season, said it is forced to put its prices up by almost 50 per cent during the peak season.

‘People accuse us of ripping families off by charging higher prices during school holidays but we are actually just balancing our books because we can't fill the spaces outside of the half-term holidays,’ he said.

He added that the company had accounted for possibly having to pay the £700 fines: ‘We've balanced it in our figures.’

The company director said it was up to parents to decide whether to take the risk of taking their children out of school during term-time.

He added: ‘Parents know the situation at the time and whether or not their children are doing well in school.

‘We are offering something (skiing) that is only available at certain times of the year. Also it is a sporting holiday and not just sitting on the beach.

‘The whole change regarding term-time holidays, which was aimed at tackling the problem of truancy, has directly affected families who want to take their children on holiday but cannot afford to go because prices are so expensive during school holidays.

‘In the UK everybody goes on holiday at exactly the same time and from a business perspective it means that you only get your children and family bookings in half-term holidays and it doesn't get balanced out across the rest of our season.’

Mr Quince added: ‘Skiing is a skill children can learn and develop. As a country we don't do particularly well investing in sport and the Olympics. It's fallen by a wayside a bit.’
