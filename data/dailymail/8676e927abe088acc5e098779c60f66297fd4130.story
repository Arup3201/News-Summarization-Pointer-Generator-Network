Callum Smith continued his seemingly inexorable rise with a hard-fought but ultimately comfortably victory over Nikola Sjekloca.

Facing by far the toughest opponent of his 15-fight career, Smith controlled the fight from start to finish with only his trademark stoppage missing from an otherwise accomplished performance.

In doing so, he took another step towards challenging for a world title, just two years after turning professional after missing out on the Olympics in 2012.

Callum Smith recorded a comfortable victory in Liverpool against Nikola Sjekloca

Smith cruised to a unanimous points victory against his Montenegrin opponent

Sjekloca arrived in Liverpool having lost just twice in 30 contests, on points to Sakio Bika and to world champion Arthur Abraham.

And, as he promised, the Serbian gave Smith a stern examination in front of his home crowd at the Echo Arena.

The opening round was cagey with both men relying on their jabs but Smith gradually began to feel his way into the contest.

And by the fourth round, he looked to have Sjekloca's number as he drove a left hook into the challenger's body, wobbling him briefly.

Smith extended his unbeaten start in the professional game to 15 victories

Sensing blood, Smith marched forward and had his opponent under severe duress but ran out of time in the session to finish the job.

And Sjekloca recovered sufficiently between rounds and continued to frustrate Smith, taking him beyond the sixth stanza for the only the second time in his career.

And Smith, one of four boxing brothers, was in uncharted territory by the 11th round but had more than enough in the tank to round off a disciplined performance.

The only drama in the final session was an outburst of song from the travelling Welsh contingent in support of Nathan Cleverly ahead of his rematch with Tony Bellew.

The judges were in agreement as to the winner with varying scores of 118-111, 120-108 and 118-110.

Smith, whose gran passed away last week, said: 'It's been a hard week for the family but going to the gym has helped.

'I hurt him with a body shot and that proves I can hurt anyone in the world. He was tough but I was hesitant to go for him because I hadn't been past 12 rounds.'
