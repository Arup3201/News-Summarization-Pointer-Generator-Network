Mario Stojka has been jailed for 3 years for a violent street robbery of a 78-year-old woman in Bradford and had similar previous convictions in Slovakia 

A violent robber who mugged an elderly woman in the street and tried to tear off her jewellery had been allowed into Britain despite a string of previous convictions in his native Slovakia. 

Mario Stojka, 30, tried to rip off Jean Crowther's watch and rings before he snatched £200 in cash from her handbag as the 78-year-old desperately tried to defend herself with her walking stick in Bradford, west Yorkshire. 

The pensioner is now too scared to go out alone to do her weekly shop or go to bingo with friends.  

Stojka, who has been cautioned twice for shoplifting since he came to the UK, has also served time in prison in Slovakia for theft, credit fraud and dangerous and threatening behaviour, Bradford Crown Court heard. 

MPs have called for the Slovakian to be deported and for people coming to the UK to have criminal record checks, which does not currently happen as a matter of course on people coming to the UK from the EU. 

Stojka admitted robbing the pensioner on February 4 and was jailed for three years and four months. 

The court heard that on this day Mrs Crowther was waiting for a taxi home after her latest weekly shopping trip. 

Stojka, who is known to have personality issues,  was wearing make-up and a headscarf at the time and approached the pensioner and complimented her. He then grabbed the cross and chain round her neck and tried to rip off her rings and watch before snatching the money she had just withdrawn.

Charlotte Eastwood, prosecuting, said: 'He asked if she was okay and if she needed help.

'He complimented her on her scarf and then tried to tug off her jewellery. She was fighting back by pushing him with her walking stick but it had no effect.'

The attack was witnessed by passers-by Safdar Yousaf and Mushtak Ahmed, who retrieved Mrs Crowther's money and gave chase - but Stojka got away. They were commended by Judge Neil Davey QC for their efforts. 

In her victim impact statement, Mrs Crowther, now 79, said she was too afraid to make her weekly shopping trip to the centre of Bradford and her trips out to bingo were a struggle.

She was nervous at home, had difficulty sleeping and feared that any noise in the night was Stojka 'coming to get her.' 

The court heard that Stojka had 'matters outstanding' against him in Slovakia but no direction was made to deport him by the judge. 

After the case, MP George Galloway, whose constituency includes Bradford city centre, called for Stojka to be deported when he serves his sentence. 

Bradford Crown Court heard that Stojka had a string of previous convictions for similar crimes in Slovakia

'It is entirely wrong that such criminals should be allowed to stay in Britain and efforts should be made to check the criminal records of people wanting to come to the UK,' he said. 

Under current Home Office rules people coming into the UK are checked against security, police and immigration 'watch lists.' Responsibility for adding serious crimes to watch lists lies with the country where they are committed. 

Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley said the case was another reason why he felt Britain should leave the EU. He said: 'He is clearly a despicable piece of work. He should be kicked straight out of the country when he comes out of prison.

'This is the problem of being in the EU. The free movement of people opens the door to criminals. This man is one of many.'

Detective Inspector Richard Partis, from West Yorkshire Police, said: 'Stojka pretended to show concern for his vulnerable victim, before attempting to rob her of her possessions.

'We would like to thank the members of the public who intervened and brought this to the attention of our officers.

'Violent crimes such as robbery will not be tolerated in Bradford District and police will look to take the strongest action possible against offenders.'
