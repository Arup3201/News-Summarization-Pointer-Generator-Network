Police have released a recording of the 911 call that brought officers to the upscale South Carolina community where a cop fatally shot unarmed ex-college footballer Jonathan Ferrell in the early hours of Saturday morning.

A sobbing woman can be heard pleading for police to ‘please hurry’ after telling a dispatcher that a man was breaking into her front door.

‘He’s still there yelling,’ the woman said as the 911 dispatcher told her officers were on their way. ‘He’s yelling. He’s yelling.’

Jonathan Ferrell ran up to this house in the upscale Bradfield Farm community and started 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention

The unidentified woman keeps repeating ‘Oh, my god! Oh, my god!’ throughout the call.

She also told the 911 operator that she had a baby in a crib and didn't know what to do. ‘He’s in his bed. I don’t know what to do. I can’t believe I opened the door,’ she said.

Later, she said the man was knocking on her door and ‘he's in my front yard yelling.’

The deadly encounter unfolded at about 2.30 a.m. on Saturday morning after 24-year-old Jonathan Ferrell, had apparently been in an automobile wreck. A crash so severe he would have had to climb out of the back window to escape.

Ferrell apparently walked about a half-mile to the nearest house at the upscale Bradfield Farm community and was 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention.

Thinking it was her husband coming home late from work, the woman who lived there opened the door. When she saw Ferrell, she shut it and called police.

When three officers arrived they claims that Ferrell ran towards them. One officer attempted to Taser Ferrell but that didn't work and investigators said Ferrell continued to run towards Officer Randall Kerrick who had his service weapon drawn.

Officer Kerrick fired 12 shots at Ferrell, striking Ferrell ten times.

CMPD said officers on the scene thought Ferrell was a threat, but Kerrick was the only one who drew his gun and fired.

Kerrick appeared in court on Tuesday afternoon after being charged with voluntary manslaughter. He is the first officer charged in a fatal shooting in more than 30 years.

‘We’re confident at the resolution of this case it will be found that Officer Kerrick’s actions were justified on the night in question,’ his attorney Michael Greene said in a brief statement outside the courtroom, reports The Charlotte Observer.

The Charlotte NAACP called on Tuesday for an increased charge for Officer Kerrick because 'recent released information about the incident shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that this was more than manslaughter, this was a brutal killing and execution of Jonathan Ferrell.'

'There is no evidence that shows Jonathan Ferrell should have been shot at all,' Charlotte NAACP president Kojo Nantambu said.

'But for Officer Kerrick to shoot 12 times and striking Mr. Ferrell 10 times indicates more than a reflex, it smells more of hatred and rage which shows that Mr. Kerrick was predisposed in killing a Black Man and did so with extreme prejudice.'

He says the NAACP will be lobbying for a murder charge, saying that 'no other charge will suffice.'

Brotherly love: Jonathan Ferrell's brother Willie said. 'Jonathan was never the type of person to harm nobody'

Ferrell's family said the former Florida A&M University football player moved to Charlotte about a year ago to be with his fiancee and was working two jobs. He wanted to go back to school and eventually become an automotive engineer.

'You took a piece of my heart that I can never put back,' said Ferrell's mother, Georgia Ferrell, as she clutched a stuffed Winnie the Pooh doll her 24-year-old son loved as a child.

The
encounter was set in motion around 2:30 a.m. Saturday when Ferrell's 
car ran off the entrance road to a sprawling suburban neighborhood that 
was carved out of farmland about a decade ago some 15 miles from 
downtown Charlotte. A sign near the crash site advertises a neighborhood
watch meeting in a few days.

After
crashing his car into trees, Ferrell kicked out the back window and 
walked half a mile up a hill to the first set of closely-clustered 
houses he could see.

Bradfield Farm, 17 miles east of Charlotte, is a community of 1000 white 
two-story homes, it also has four tennis courts, two swimming pools and a clubhouse. New and resale houses are 
available in the $110,000 - $230,000 range.

Georgia Ferrell: 'I truly forgive him. I pray for him. And I pray that he gets off the police force,' Georgia Ferrell said. 'You took a piece of my heart that I can never get back'

Ferrell's mother said Kerrick had no business being a police officer if he couldn't react properly to a man who needed help.

'I truly forgive him. I pray for him. And I pray that he gets off the police force,' Georgia Ferrell said.

His family painted a picture of a bright man with an 'infectious smile' who was always there for his brothers and sisters.

'He
was a role model,' said his brother, Frank. 'He had so much love in his
heart. And he was always concerned about his family.'

'He
had dreams of being an automotive engineer. He wanted to design a car 
from the very last bolt to the interior,' his brother said.

He
said he didn't know where his brother was going that night, or why he 
got into the accident. But he said his brother had never been in trouble
before.
