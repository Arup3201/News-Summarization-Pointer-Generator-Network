Billy Knott regrets the way things ended at Chelsea, ditched following a serious breach of discipline aged just 17.

He missed the victorious conclusion to their FA Youth Cup campaign and left behind his closest friends, some of whom were later involved in the infamous smoke grenade incident which forced an evacuation of the training ground. His misdemeanour was deemed so serious that a confidentiality agreement stops him or Chelsea from revealing what it was.

The teenager fell out of love with the game and could not even bear to watch football on television.

But Knott has come a long way in five years. On Saturday he returns to Stamford Bridge as Bradford City’s biggest hope of upsetting the Premier League leaders. Indeed, the Bantams would not be here if it wasn’t for his three goals in the third round against Millwall.

The 22-year-old has matured since the days of being depicted as a teen tearaway.

Knott is returning to West London as a man.

‘I do regret it. It was me in the wrong and I messed stuff up,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I could have learnt a whole lot more. I was young and naive. I always had belief in myself as a player, but you need more than that.

‘Looking back, I would take so much more on board, because these players are the best in the world and I was training with them.

‘The likes of Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard and John Terry, they get it right every single day. They enjoy it every day as well. That’s the big thing — these guys have been at the top for so long yet love coming in to train. That’s the key thing, you’ve got to love what you do to be the best.’

Knott signed for Sunderland following his release from Chelsea — where he had captained the junior side and won England youth honours — but he was already on a second chance despite his tender years.

He did well on Wearside and was rated by the management. Still, though, he failed to make a breakthrough and was sent on loan.

But Paolo Di Canio arrived in 2013 and took an instant liking to Knott — perhaps it was a shared penchant for spectacular goals — and gave him a top-flight debut at Spurs. The affection was mutual.

‘People say he was crazy, and he was in a way, but I just think it was more passion,’ said the Canvey Island-born attacking midfielder, who has seven goals this season.

‘I think he liked me and he had me in training with the first team and gave me my debut. He would join in the training all the time and be very vocal and hands-on.

‘I loved that time and, on the whole, I enjoyed my time at Sunderland but I knew I wasn’t going to get a chance there. I had gone stale.

Knott has played 30 times since moving to Bradford City, scoring seven goals in the process 

‘At a young age you don’t want to be sitting on the bench or playing in the reserves and I needed something new.’ That something was Phil Parkinson and Bradford City. Knott signed a two-year deal in the summer and endeared himself to supporters with a 25-yard rocket as Bradford enjoyed their first victory in 28 years over West Yorkshire rivals Leeds in August.

‘I’m back in love with the game now,’ he said.

‘It was hard not to make it at Chelsea but I’m learning the other side of the game now in League One. My aim is still to play in the Premier League but I think I had to drop down to progress.’

Knott scored twice in the 3-3 draw at Millwall and was on target again in a 4-0 thrashing in the replay.

‘We still had the replay to come but I was watching the fourth-round draw with my fiancée at home and I must admit I cheered when we got Chelsea,’ he said.

‘It was funny though, we went to Yeovil and lost 1-0 last week. We then got on the coach and saw that Chelsea had won 5-0 at Swansea! That was a bit scary.

‘Even with their second XI out they’ll still all be internationals and world-class players.’

Knott’s dad, Steve, has organised a bus for 40 friends and family — including Billy’s mum, Michelle, and younger brother, Sammy — to make the trip from Canvey Island to the capital.

Also in the crowd will be grandad Colin and grandma Corinne who have travelled from Malta.

‘My grandad has cancer so it’s special for him to be coming over, it means a lot to me,’ said Knott.

‘There’ll also be a rowdy crowd from Canvey Island who’ll be cheering us on. And I really think we can get a draw and take them back to our place.

‘It’ll be tough, but this is the FA Cup. Why not? We’ve just got to give it everything we’ve got and do ourselves proud.’

This time, Knott wants to leave Stamford Bridge with no regrets.
