The British public have 'fallen out of love' with Nick Clegg and there will be no return to 'Cleggmania', a frontrunner for the Lib Dem leadership has claimed.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the best Mr Clegg could hope for at the next election is earning the 'respect' of voters after five years of coalition government.

The remarks come amid a slew of polls showing support for the Lib Dems at chronic lows. 

But the party's predicament did not appear to be of much concern to a host of delegates pictured bored and asleep at the conference in Glasgow today.

Mr Davey's move to highlight the Deputy Prime Minister's dire personal ratings will be seen as fresh evidence of his own leadership ambitions.

But Mr Clegg today appeared to anoint Lib Dem Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander as the party’s leader in waiting.

Mr Clegg said he would not ‘go on forever’ as Liberal Democrat leader – adding that not a ‘Duracell rabbit’.

He said: ‘I think there are other things to do in life, and I'm thankfully not one of those people who's so obsessed with politics that I want to be in politics forever. But I would like to see the Liberal Democrats in government after next May,’ he said.

‘Tony Blair said the problem with politics is you start popular but inexperienced and as you become better at your job you become less popular. I suppose that's happened to us and to me.’

Mr Clegg added: ‘I'm 47, I've got three little kids, I've got lots of interests outside politics and lots of friends outside politics. I'm frankly too busy to do that. You should be dedicated to your job but not obsessive about it.’

The Deputy PM also shrugged off speculation that Mr Alexander was angling for his job, saying it was not a ‘sin’ to be ambitious.

‘Danny is a fantastically close friend and colleague. I don't see what's wrong with ambition,’ he said.

An ICM survey for The Guardian today showed just 17 per cent of voters think Mr Clegg is doing a good job, down by eight points since June, while 59 per cent think he is doing badly.

This gives him a dire net rating of -42 per cent, -35 per cent for Labour's Ed Miliband and only -7 per cent for Tory PM David Cameron.

A separate ComRes poll for ITV News last night showed 56 per cent of people think the Lib Dems have become irrelevant, while just 26 per cent disagree.

Just 14 per cent trust Mr Clegg to keep the promises he makes while 63 per cent believe the Lib Dem leader will break his pledges.

Some 44 per cent of adults believe it was a mistake for the party to go into Coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 and 42 per cent feel betrayed by Mr Clegg.

Most Lib Dems are resigned to the fact that Mr Clegg will lead the party into the next election.

But several senior figures are said already to be positioning for their own leadership bids, including Mr Davey, Treasury minister Danny Alexander and party president Tim Farron.

In a damning assessment on his leader's appeal, Mr Davey told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I don't think we're going to see the repeat of the last election where you in the media had what you called 'Cleggmania' when everyone fell in love with Nick Clegg. 

'Because we had to go into Coalition with the Conservatives, that's what people voted for, because we've had to take some hard choices, because of the financial mess that Labour left us with, people have fallen out of love with Nick Clegg, that's what the opinion polls show.'

He went on: 'But I tell you what, I think nearer to the election when people look at what he's delivered and what the Liberal Democrats have delivered, he'll get respect. I think we'll move from the 'Cleggmania' of the last election to Clegg-respect. 

'He deserves that respect. If you look at his record, how a really courageous British politician, taking on the Conservatives, delivering a stronger economy and a fairer society, focusing on the opportunities we want to give to all people. 

'I think Nick Clegg will win that respect and will win votes at the next election.'

In a separate poll by Lord Ashcroft, just 7 per cent of people say they plan to vote Lib Dem next year.

Of those, just a third - or 2.2 per cent of all voters - say they will definitely vote for Mr Clegg's party.

Overall, the Tories are ahead on 32 per cent - after their successful conference last week - with Labour on 30 per cent.

The Lib Dems are languishing in fourth place in the polls - equal with the Greens, but behind UKP

UKIP are on 17 per cent, with the Greens on 7 per cent - the same as the Lib Dems.

Mr Clegg yesterday played down his party's struggles in the polls. He told ITV: 'I've literally lost count of the times, with the greatest respect, that I've been asked questions saying 'oh isn't it going to be a disaster? Aren't you going to be wiped out? Isn't it all going to be terrible?' And every time we confound the sceptics and I genuinely think we will do so next year.

'I'm not a soothsayer or a pollster so you'll need to speak pollsters and soothsayers about what they think the future will hold. All I can tell you is what I believe, what our values are and the pride that I have in what we've done over the last four and a half years.'
