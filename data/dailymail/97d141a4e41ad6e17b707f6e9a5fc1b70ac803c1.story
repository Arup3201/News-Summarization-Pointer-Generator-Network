With the hottest summer in seven years upon us, it seems that Brits are really feeling the heat.

But it isn't just women using the opportunity to expose some flesh.

The latest research reveals that men are daring to bare more leg than ever before as temperatures across the UK continue to soar.

High street sales data has revealed that demand for men’s shorts that sit at the top of thighs, rather than knees has shot up by a staggering 156 per cent in the last week alone.

The thighs the limit! Sales of very short shorts have surged in recent weeks, could it be thanks to Joey Essex who has been donning the designs in Essex and at Wireless festival in recent weeks?

It seems that the trend has been spurred on by celebrities with well-known faces such as TOWIE’s Joey Essex and Mark Wright, Cristiano Ronaldo, Danny Dyer, Olly Murs and One Direction’s Louis Tomlinson, who all prefer the thigh-skimming option.

Spotted on the recent SS14 catwalks of Versace, Emporio Armani, Dolce & Gabbana and Gieves & Hawkes, this is one trend that has definitely made the leap to the great British high street, and looks set to continue.

Debenhams spokesperson Ed Watson, who carried out the research, said: 'We have all heard about the emergence of "mankles" – male ankles peeking out from rolled up trousers. Well, this takes it to the next level.

'All over the world, British men are renowned for exposing their white knobbly knees during the summer holidays.

Higher and higher: As temperatures rose at Glastonbury, so did the men's short length with Nick Grimshaw (L) and Oliver Cheshire (R) donning the tiny designs

The only way is shorts: James Argent, Joey and their TOWIE friends have also been sporting the thigh-skimming designs

Get shorty! The 'Cristiano effect' caused by football star Ronaldo's barely-there holiday wear has seen sales of men's micro shorts surge. Rio Ferdinand and Olly Murs also dabble with the trend on holiday

'For the daring few, wearing short shorts can be a liberating experience, particularly when faced with the recent tropic temperatures.

'We haven’t seen a demand for short shorts as high as this since Wham sparked the trend in the 1980s – we are currently considering whether or not to go even shorter for next summer!'

The retailer has seen a particularly high demand for short shorts in Newcastle, Glasgow and Cardiff.

Flashback: Debenhams say they haven't seen a demand for short shorts as high as this since Wham sparked the trend in the 1980s

During the 19th and early 20th centuries
shorts were worn as outerwear only by young boys and because of this, 
men would not wear shorts to avoid looking immature.

In the 1930s, shorts started to be worn 
for casual comfort (e.g. outdoor and athletic activities) by both men 
and women.However, it was still taboo to wear shorts outside certain 
activities.

Since arpond World War II, when soldiers 
often served in tropical locations, adult men have worn shorts more 
often, especially in summer weather, but the perception of shorts as 
being only for young boys took several decades to change.

By the late 
20th century it became common for men to wear shorts as casual 
wear in summer.

The 1980s saw the emergence of short shorts and there has been a steady rise in popularity.

Longer, baggier board style shorts were 
favoured in the 1990s but in recent years a tailored, shorter style has 
become most popular.
