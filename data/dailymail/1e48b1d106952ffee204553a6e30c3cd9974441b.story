Midfielder Angel di Maria is a big doubt for Manchester United's game against Tottenham on Sunday because of a pelvis injury he suffered in training on Christmas Eve.

The injury that ruled Angel di Maria out of Manchester United's game against Newcastle keeps him doubtful

Belgian duo Marouane Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj are out through illness, but left-back Luke Shaw took part in a post-match training session on Boxing Day and could feature for the first time since November 22, when he injured his ankle against Arsenal.

Utility man Daley Blind (knee) and defender Marcos Rojo (thigh) are out and midfielder Ander Herrera (muscle injury) is unlikely to feature.
