The twin brother of PC David Rathband – the policeman blinded by gunman Raoul Moat – paid a tearful tribute to his sibling at a memorial service yesterday, saying: ‘I have lost half of me.’

Darren Rathband, 44, comforting his brother’s children Mia, 13, and Ashley, 19, told a congregation of more than 800 mourners: ‘Every day grief puts on a new face.’

PC Rathband was in his patrol car in July 2010 when he was shot twice by Moat.

Time to take him home: Ashley, 19, and Mia Rathband, 13, are comforted at the service alongside their uncle Darren, who suggested that his twin had found 'support outside of the marriage'

He was found hanged at home in Blyth, Northumberland, on February 29.

It is believed he was devastated by the collapse of his marriage and in
 continual pain from his injuries. His wife Kath – from whom he had 
separated – was not at the service.

She will attend his funeral next Saturday in his home town of Stafford.

Hundreds of well-wishers brought Newcastle city centre to a standstill as the coffin bearing his cap, draped in a Union flag with his call sign, Tango 190, spelt out in flowers, was driven to St Nicholas Cathedral.

David Rathband's estranged wife Kath refused to attend his memorial service because of the the policeman's relationship with a woman he met through his charity work.

Kath, 42, has been hit hard by claims that she didn't support her husband in his darkest moments and has moved to defend herself.

Their 20-year marriage ended when Kath discovered David, 44, had been seeing another woman.

'At first he denied the extent of the relationship, and she was prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt,' a source close to the family told The Sunday Mirror.

'But when he eventually admitted it she made it clear there was no chance of a reconciliation and asked for a divorce.

'The guilt Kath feels now is immense. But she also feels it is unfair to lay the blame with her when people don't know the facts.'

The family friend also revealed that Kath gave the couple's children the option of staying away from the service but the pair decided at the last minute that they would attend.

Kath has also employed public relations guru Max Clifford to help put across her side of the story

Inside, mourners included Police Minister Nick Herbert and Northumbria Chief Constable Sue Sim.

Earlier, Mr Rathband – a police officer in Australia – formally clocked his brother off from what would have been his last shift.

He closed his memorial tribute saying: ‘It’s time to take my brother home.’

Before the service Darren, who organised the service as a
 celebration of Pc Rathband's life, watched as the 
pall-bearers from each of the three emergency services brought out the 
coffin and carried it the short distance into the church.

During his heartbreaking speech watched by about 800 people he said: 'I have lost half of me.

'You don't get over it, you just get through it.

'Every day grief puts on a new face.

'My brother said to me "you're a good brother", I say to my brother "you're a great brother".

'It is time to take my brother home.'

On the way to the cathedral, the 
hearse stopped at Etal Lane police station, on the outskirts of 
Newcastle, where Pc Rathband was based.

It was there Darren booked him off the shift he always intended to complete.

The Dean of Newcastle, the Very 
Reverend Chris Dalliston, welcomed mourners to today's service by saying: 
'We come to give thanks for David's life and to recognise the cost he 
and others have to pay in the call of duty.'

Calls were made to better protect 999 workers injured in the line of duty during today's memorial service.

The Government should introduce Rathband's Law to ensure emergency services personnel who are hurt while helping others do not struggle for financial security.

The calls were made in a speech by Pc Rathband's friend Tony Horne, a former DJ and ghost-writer of his autobiography Tango 190.

Despite being left blind, Pc Rathband set up the Blue Lamp Foundation to help other police officers, paramedics or firefighters injured by a criminal act while at work.

In a moving, heartfelt speech, Mr Horne said: 'For me, it would be a beautiful irony and job done if legislation was passed so that there was no need for a Blue Lamp Foundation.

'Rathband's Law, ensuring that all injured servicemen in the line of duty should not want or wait for financial security and emotional support from now until the end of time.'

Mr Horne directly called on politicians to make supporting injured personnel law, saying: 'If you are a public figure who has stood by David sincerely in support, or as a cynical photo opp, your time is now and your duty is to make sure that there are no empty promises and hollow words - make the ethos of the Blue Lamp Foundation a political reality.'

Carly Fee, a humanist celebrant, 
said: 'David served the North East for 12 years. He put himself at risk 
every day for the greater good.'

She added: 'One minute he was living an ordinary life - a dad, a husband, a copper.

'The next he was thrust into the 
public eye - a celebrity, guest of honour at sporting events, a national
 hero who got a five minute standing ovation at the Pride of Britain 
Awards.

'Hero worship left David bemused and 
befuddled, he couldn't get his head around it.

'He swore, without a hint 
of false modesty, he was just a normal bloke.'

Jos Forester-Melville, a member of 
the public who helped at the scene of a terrible road traffic accident 
in Northumberland in which two women died said Pc Rathband, the first 
officer at the scene, showed tremendous compassion in the days and weeks
 that followed.

She said: 'David was at that time the kindest and most caring person I could have wished for.

'He spent considerable time talking and listening, making sure I understood I had done what I could.'

Tony Horne, a former DJ and ghost-writer of Pc Rathband's autobiography Tango 190 gave a moving speech during the service.

Having listened to Pc Rathband relive 
the horror of being shot for the book, he said: 'I knew then that he had
 seen too much, and I feared this moment would come.'

He added: 'It's to his credit that he fought so long.

'Of
 that night in July 2010, my friend looked danger in the eye and was not
 found wanting when asked to make the ultimate sacrifice, displaying 
bravery in a split second that collectively most of us will struggle to 
match in a lifetime.

'Congratulations, David, on every day that you lived after. You really were playing on well into added time.'

Mr Horne called on Northumbria Police to accept it made mistakes on the night his friend was shot.

'Unprecedented and testing circumstances I accept, but I urge you now, to tell the whole story of the mistakes that night and finally come forward and say publicly "Sorry David, we should have avoided what happened to you".

'You owe that to your fallen officer.'

He went on to call on the media to stop naming the gunman who devastated Pc Rathband and his family's lives.

'My friend is called David Rathband - everybody knows his name, and how he became a hero,' he said.

'Let his name, not his attacker be remembered for generations to come.

'We must move from the shadow of that 
evil and remember him always for his good in society rather than the 
wickedness bestowed upon him.'

Mr Horne also spoke warmly about the 
officer's widow, Kath, saying: 'I want to say on the record what a 
tremendous woman you are.'

He finished: 'As a society, David, we owe you a debt of thanks. So many people in life pass through our worlds - here today, gone tomorrow.

'David may be gone today, but he is very much here in all my tomorrows.

'Rest in peace my friend. I love you, and you're safe now.'

As the hearse drove away, met with 
public applause a yellow and red Northumbria Police badge tribute could be 
seen.

Policing Minister Nick Herbert said afterwards: 'I think it is right 
that we remember this brave police officer and what he did for the 
community that he served.'

Chief Constable Sue Sim added: 'He was gunned down in tragic circumstances doing the job of constable he loved.

'My heart goes out to Kath and the children and the rest of the family.'
