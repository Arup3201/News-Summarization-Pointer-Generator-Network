The mother of twin boys, born joined at the abdomen, has described her joy after a nine-hour operation successfully separated them.

'It's the most wonderful feeling in the world,' Jenni Ezell told Good Morning America today.

Her six-week-old sons, Owen and Emmett, are now recovering in their own beds in intensive care at Medical City Children's Hospital in Dallas, Texas.

'I'm just so happy that they're here 
and alive and thriving,' Mrs Ezell said, as she held back her tears of 
joy. 'It's the best feeling in the world for a mom.'

When
the babies were born in Guthrie, Oklahoma on July 17, they shared a 
liver and intestines. Mrs Ezell, and her husband Dave, who have two 
other sons, moved to Dallas for the boys' medical care.

On
Saturday, they were prepared for surgery and a team of doctors, 
surgeons and nurses worked to separate the boys, either of whom could 
have been lost in the operation, NewsOK reported.

At a press conference at the medical center, Ms Ezell excitedly said: 'I have two babies … two separate babies!'

Her husband added: 'A couple of pretty good looking babies, I’d say.'

'The
whole pregnancy was very frightening,' Mrs Ezell said. 'I didn’t know 
what would happen. I didn’t know if they would make it ... But, the 
boys, right now, are doing well.'

Relief: Dave and Jenni Ezell say they can start planning for their sons' futures after the operation

The couple were told the were expecting conjoined twins in March, and had been advised by one doctor to have an abortion, according to CBS 11.

'We didn’t think that they had a chance. We thought they were not going to make it at all. So we decided to abort,' Mrs Ezell said. 'It was the hardest decision that a mother has to make about her babies.'

However, a specialist at Medical City Dallas renewed their faith, telling them 'These boys have a really good chance. This is not your only option.'

Although they can't hold their babies yet, the Ezells are finally able to start planning their futures.

'Taking them home and having Christmas with them - I’m already planning their first birthday parties,. I'm looking forward to everything,' Mrs Ezell said.

The Ezells were able to say goodbye before the boys were taken to surgery.

'As a mother, I hope I never have to 
experience a moment like that again,' Mrs Ezell wrote in her 'Ezell 
Twins' blog on Tuesday.

'I didn't know what was going to happen. I 
didn't know if I would see my babies alive again, if I would see only 
one, or if I would see them after they had gone to be with their 
creator.'

But doctors successfully separated the boys' shared liver and other parts of their digestive system.

They will need further surgeries in the future; after they are two-years-old, they will require 'skin expanders' for their wounds, their mother explained. Another operation will require surgeons to pull abdominal muscles into place, which should leave them with only a neat line of a scar

After this, if the parents wish, they can opt for the boys to have a third surgery to create a belly button for each of them.

But for now, the family is just taking it one day at a time.

'They're starting to open their little 
eyes, and they're starting to wiggle their little fingers,' their 
father, Dave Ezell, told NBC-DFW. 'You can see that recognition in their 
face. It's truly heartwarming.'

The family now hopes that the twins will be able to return home in time for Christmas.

'It's wonderful for us to be able to sit here and think about, "How are we going to bring these two boys home? What are they going to be like?"' Mr Ezell said.

The couple has kept family, friends and strangers up to date on the pregnancy, birth and surgery through their blog and on Facebook.

'As far as the rest of the future steps, I know healing, breathing independently of machines, and feeding are on the horizon, but I'm not sure how long it will take,' Jenni wrote on the blog.

Roughly one out of every 200,000 live births worldwide results in conjoined twins, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.

Around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and about 35 per cent survive only one day. The survival rate is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent, the Center reported.

The condition is three times more likely to occur among females than males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest, sharing organs.

Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, experts say. Although success rates have improved over the years, surgical separation is still rare. Since 1950, at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time.

After separation, most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines.

Although risky, there are many stories of successful separations.

Most recently, Utah twins Kendra and Maliyah Herrin, who were born sharing an abdomen, pelvis, liver, kidney, large intestine and two legs, just celebrated seven years since they were separated aged four. Their family said the girls, who are learning to walk with the aid of prosthetics, are the happiest and healthiest they have ever been.
