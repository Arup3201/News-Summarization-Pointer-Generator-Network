For those who savour the spectacle of a manager at bay, David Moyes is providing splendid sport. The poor fellow is being scrutinised with sadistic relish.

Are those stress lines on his brow? Does he seem a touch haggard? Has he lost the trust of his players? Is he crumpling under the pressure? Might he be considering something drastic; resignation, perhaps? The possibilities are endless.

This past fortnight has not been kind to English clubs in the Champions League. Manchester City were gently passed to pieces by Barcelona. 

What next? United players look dejected as Olympiacos go 2-0 up in Greece in midweek

Where's the passion? Moyes has had his fair share of criticism, but the players deserve there's too

Arsenal, more creditably, were beaten by the reigning champions Bayern Munich, while Chelsea at least  managed a goal in their insipid draw with Galatasaray.

But it was Manchester United who commanded most of the shock–horror notices by losing to Olympiakos. While the other results were merely disappointing, United’s first-leg performance carried darker overtones.

This was a defeat which seemed to crystalise all the doubts and suspicions which now surround United.

For this looked horribly like an exercise in shoulder-shrugging indifference. It was the kind of performance that demeaned a major European club. And worse, it damaged the reputation of ‘the best League in the world’.

Despite all the evidence to the  contrary, that banal title is so often bestowed that it is rarely questioned. Its supporters insist that no other league can offer such pace, such  physical strength, such unstinting, often misguided, effort.

And then there is the money; uncounted and uncountable, blissfully bubbling from a tap which is never turned off.

Everything about the Premier League reeks of extreme wealth, from the gargantuan television contracts to the munificent patronage of sheik and oligarch, the stunning transfer fees, the steepling salaries, the insatiable taste for tacky excess.

Sure, it cannot produce the equal of a Bayern, a Barcelona or a Real Madrid, neither can it produce enough capable  English players to mount a  credible World Cup challenge, but no matter.

The Premier League makes a lot of ordinary players insanely rich, and it yields a winter’s worth of Super Sundays and Magic Mondays. The best in the world? No contest.

Such is the delusion, one which Roy Keane dismissed in a few contemptuous phrases the other evening. Keane described the notion as ‘nonsense’.

Invisible: Wayne Rooney put in an absent performance in Athens on Tuesday night

He said we had been ‘brainwashed’, that it was not ‘the best league’ but merely ‘the best brand’. In other words, the marketing is superb while the football is all too frequently second rate.

And reality kicks in when our clubs approach the sharp end of a European campaign. Which brings us back to the manager of Manchester United. Moyes has been in the job for less than a season and he has undoubtedly been disturbed by the discovery that the team he inherited are woefully unfit for purpose.

The flaws present themselves. Tom Cleverley’s attempts to influence midfield affairs are as fruitless with United as they are with England. Nemanja Vidic is no longer of relevance and as for the likes of Ashley Young, Chris Smalling and Antonio Valencia, the least said the better.

Off colour: Tom Cleverley was hotly-tipped not so long ago, but has been disappointing overall

Robin van Persie was anxious to avoid any shadow of blame for his team’s plight: ‘My fellow players are sometimes occupying the spaces I want to play in, and when I see that it makes it difficult,’ he explained. 

Then, having missed from 10 yards against Olympiakos, he reflected that it was: ‘A shame because I don’t get a lot of chances.’

Van Persie is reported to be ‘considering his future’ in the summer. While he is at it, he might give some thought to his recent past.

Yet we doubt that there will be any serious self-examination from any of these people. Indeed, Michael Carrick seemed mildly miffed when it was suggested that United’s players might have brought their troubles upon themselves.

Carrick, you see, is a famous footballer and just 10 months ago he and his chums won the championship of the best league in the world.

As such, they are immune from criticism. No, if anybody deserves censure for United’s abysmal season, then we must turn to the usual  suspect, to the man whose ongoing agonies are public property.

Of course Moyes has made his share of mistakes. His pragmatic strategies have often seemed at odds with United’s cavalier tradition, his bearing has sometimes appeared dourly disgruntled, while his transfer dealings have been uninspired.

Maestro? Carrick is usually United's go-to man, but was poor on Tuesday night at Olympiacos

Outstretched: David De Gea is well beaten by Campbell's shot in the 55th minute to deflate United

Flat out: Robin van Persie lies on the floor after missing United's best chance of the game late on

Yet he is a talented, driven man who has taken on a massive task. If he is to succeed, he will have to spend vast sums of money and shed a cargo of footballers.

And he will do so in the knowledge that little or no public blame will be attributed to those under-performing young men, nor to their successors. If it should all go wrong then he, the manager, will carry the can.

Such is the nature of the job and David Moyes understood that when he signed his handsome contract. He  neither seeks nor deserves our sympathy but, as the headlines grow harsher and the Twitterati prattle their doltish abuse, he is entitled to a degree of intelligent understanding. It is not a lot to ask, from the best league in the world.

 

Greg Dyke’s first six months as Football Association chairman have not been an unqualified success.

From his opening battle cry — ‘I don’t think anyone realistically thinks we are going to win the World Cup in Brazil’ — to his fatuous cut-throat gesture at the announcement of England’s World Cup draw, to his ham-fisted attempts to recruit a so-called ‘England Commission’, Dyke has proceeded with the measured tread of a drunk on roller skates. But his latest mishap is far more serious.

Not present: Dyke was presiding over an FA board meeting in London while Finney's funeral was taking place

On Thursday, when the English game was gathering in Preston to bury one of the noblest, most sublimely gifted men it has ever produced, Dyke was presiding over an FA board meeting, 218 miles away in London.

Now, it is possible that Dyke does not understand how much Sir Tom Finney meant to English football, nor how rich was his contribution to the nation’s game. If so, then somebody, somewhere should have had the wit to brief him.

Because the chairman of the Football Association should not have been swapping platitudes with a bunch of blazers.

He
 should have been seated in St John’s Minster to honour Sir Tom. It was 
more than a matter of priorities; it was a question of duty.

Vincent Tan’s attempts to endear himself to Cardiff City followers have taken another fascinating turn.

His earlier efforts included firing the successful manager, Malky Mackay, and changing the club’s colours from the traditional blue to a ‘lucky’ red.

Now, with his club in the bottom three of the Premier League, the owner has warned supporters not to take him for granted.

‘Right now, I will stay,’ he said. ‘Unless the fans p*** me off so much, then I may leave.’ Clearly, the old charmer sees this as an ominous threat. He may well be mistaken.

A week ago, in an item on Fulham FC, I mentioned two of their former players, Johnny Haynes and Tosh Chamberlain.

Haynes was described as a ‘great’ player, Chamberlain as ‘a blissfully under-talented winger’.

I was attempting to convey my belief that, by comparison with the brilliant Haynes, everyone who played for Fulham in that era was ‘blissfully under-talented’.

As many Fulham fans have pointed out, it was a poor choice of words which was quite unfair to a fine footballer and a much-loved character.

I have apologised to Tosh and accepted his affectionate, and very ‘Fulhamish’, reprimand.
