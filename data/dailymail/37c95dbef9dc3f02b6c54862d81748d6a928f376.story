Britain’s first woman Prime Minister may have divided public opinion on many issues. But there was no doubting the power of her sense of style.

And while Samantha Cameron paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher by wearing a pussy-bow blouse at her funeral yesterday, it is the Iron Lady's signature handbag that is causing more of a storm out in the real world.

Since the announcement of Baroness Thatcher’s death, luxury bag firm Launer - the brand also favoured by the Queen - has seen a 53 per cent rise in sales of the black structured handbag that Thatcher loved.

Thatcher's handbag became associated both with her personal fashion and her political personality, with her fiery temper and the permanent presence of her rigid black bag causing MPs to coin the phrase 'handbagging'

The Baroness favored classic styles, often in black, such as the Bellini (left) and Adagio (right) style, which have both had a increase in sales following her death last Monday

Thatcher’s love of a good handbag - frequently a Launer - became inextricably linked to her political persona – particularly after her ministers in the 1980s coined the phrase ‘handbagging’ - a reference 
to both the structured  handbags she always carried and the dressing downs she would give her team.

And now sales of the styles Thatcher treasured the most, including the Bellini and the Adagio, have seen a huge jump in sales.

In a reflection of the impact of her death, the biggest spike in sales came at 9.30am on the day of her funeral and on the evening of Monday 8 April after the announcement of her passing.

Gerald
Bodmer, CEO of Launer London, fondly remembers how the relationship 
between his Launer London label and Baroness Thatcher began, ‘It was the
early 80s and I saw a rather humorous cartoon in a national broadsheet
of Baroness Thatcher waving around a rather understated handbag, and it
suddenly struck me that she should be wearing our bags.

Thatcher's love of her black handbags spanned her entire political career, from her election to a member of parliament, to well after she had left Downing Street and retired

‘With Her Majesty The Queen a loyal supporter of Launer for many years by now, it seemed only fitting.

‘I
sent one of our handbags (in standard issue black, in the highest 
quality) from our mainline collection to her with a cutting of the 
cartoon, and not long afterwards received a personal letter of thanks 
from Baroness Thatcher herself, who adored it.

‘I
suspected she appreciated my sense of humour, also. Thus, a 
longstanding relationship between Launer and Baroness Thatcher began 
until her passing this week'.

The Queen has long been a fan of Launer bags, awarding the company a Royal Warrant in 1981 and is often seen at public events clasping one of their creations

Whilst Baroness Thatcher embraced the gesture of a Launer handbag as a gift, she insisted on always purchasing them herself, or through her shopper who struck up a lasting friendship with Gerald.

Baroness Thatcher would always send a letter of acknowledgement to Gerald whenever she purchased a Launer handbag.

She would usually make two purchases 
yearly throughout the 80s and 90s, all in a very, simple structured 
style in black or nude tones.

Baroness
Thatcher would always emphasise in her personal letters to Gerald how 
much she wanted to support British business and would often purposefully
carry Launer bags on foreign appointments.

‘There
is a great deal of noise made around Made In Britain these days, which 
we are a great advocate of as all our product is made in our factory in 
Walsall with traditional British handmade techniques. Baroness Thatcher 
really understood the ethos of Launer and this is something she wanted 
to be associated with. Interestingly, she would only buy bags for 
daywear, never eveningwear’ Gerald says.

The firm experienced a similar spike in sales after the Jubilee celebrations when the monarch was pictured on multiple
occasions with her trusty Launer bags.

Then, the majority of sales were 
international, whereas in the case of Margaret Thatcher's sales spike, 
over 75 per cent of those purchasing the bags were in the UK.

Launer has also seen a 43 per cent sales rise with its more colourful handbags and clutchbags including the Traviata handbag in yellow (left) and the Lisa handbag in green (right)

'When
Sam Launer came to England from Czechoslovakia over 60 years ago, he 
brought with him an idea that has remained with the company to this day;
handbags and leather goods should be elegant, be formed out of the best
materials and made by highly skilled craftspeople.'Over
the last twenty five years Launer has built up an enviable reputation 
as a very high quality manufacturer with distinctively good styling, and
currently hold the Royal Warrant to HM The Queen for handbags and small
leather goods.'Launer's 
trademark is understated, elegant and classic - beautiful leather 
articles made with pride by craftsmen and women using traditional 
skills. With care, they give years of pleasure and service.'The Launer factory is in Walsall, near Birmingham, the traditional home of leather goods manufacturing in England.'Launer
wallets, card cases, purses and handbags are handmade in the softest 
calf, exotic lizard, and ostrich skin. Every attention is paid to 
detail, and gold plated fittings feature the Launer rope emblem, the 
perfect finishing touch.'
