What boy? Stacey Kerres was found by police lying topless in a Florida hotel parking lot

A babysitter was discovered lying topless in a hotel parking lot - while the five-year-old boy entrusted to her care was left to his own devices for almost an hour.

Stacey Kerres, 47, of Fort Pierce, Florida, had no idea where her young charge was when police discovered her in the middle of the lot.

‘I don’t even know where (the boy) is right now,’ she babbled to officers after she was found.

The nanny appeared incoherent and lethargic as she was interviewed by officers in Melbourne, Florida, according to the police report.

She was and arrested on charges of child neglect.

Kerres told police she was looking after the boy while his mother gambled at a nearby casino. Police had earlier found the boy in the care of the hotel staff.

Investigators said Kerres and the boy were staying at the River Palm Hotel.

Authorities were called there after hotel staff found the boy wandering alone.

When officers questioned the youngster, he said his mother had gone to the casino and he had been left with a woman named Stacey.

Police searched the property and found Kerres, identified with a dagger-and-rose ankle tattoo, lying topless in the hotel parking lot.

Police booked Kerres into the Brevard County Jail Complex and searched unsuccessfully for the mother before turning the case over to the Department of Children and Families.

Kerres, who was ordered by a judge to have no further contact with the child pending the outcome of the case, will have a September 18 hearing on the child neglect charges.
