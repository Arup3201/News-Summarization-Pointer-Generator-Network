The mother of the young Indian woman who was fatally gang raped on a bus in New Delhi has called for the men who murdered her daughter to be hanged.

Speaking of the gang who beat her 23-year-old daughter so badly she died almost two weeks later in hospital, she said: 'My soul will never know any rest if the men who tormented my daughter are not hanged.'

The 46-year-old also spoke of how her daughter, a physiotherapy student, whispered to her on her death bed: 'Mama, I want them to be burnt alive.'

The Ravidas camp, pictured, is the notoriously lawless slum where four of the six accused by police in the Delhi gang rape case, are said to be from. The victim's mother has said she wants the men who killed her daughter to be hanged

On December 16 last year the woman was attacked by a group of men using a tyre iron as a weapon as she travelled on a bus home with a male companion following a trip to the cinema.

She suffered massive internal injuries, brain damage and a heart attack, dying in a hospital in Singapore 13 days after the attack.

Her brutal murder has sparked furor throughout India, with mass demonstrations for women's rights and calls for tougher rape laws.

The woman's mother, speaking to The Sunday Telegraph at her ancestral home in Medawara Kalan, in the northern state of Utter Pradesh, paid tribute to her daughter, saying: 'She was our life.

'I want only one thing. I want to see those animals hang.'

The female victim and her male companion boarded what appeared to be an ordinary private mini-bus after watching the film Life of Pi together.

Her male friend said a gang of six men aboard the bus - fitted with curtains and tinted windows - had planned to trap them.

Claims: Policemen report for duty at the court. A lawyer for three of the men accused of the brutal rape and killing of a 23-year-old woman claims his clients have been tortured into admitting the crime

Once on the bus, he was attacked and the 23-year-old was gang-raped by a group of allegedly drunk men, including the driver, who also violated her with an iron bar causing immense internal damage that lead to her death, he said.

The man, believed to be the only witness in the case, said he did his best to fight off the offenders.

The attackers eventually discarded the two of them by a roadside. 

Ten days after the incident the woman was flown from a hospital in India to an intensive care ward in Singapore, where it was hoped specialists might be able to save her.

By the time her parents were informed of the nature of the injuries and flown to be by her bedside in Singapore, she was barely able to speak, with much of her last communication being only in sign language.

Her mother added: 'When one of few things she said to me was: "Mama, I want them to be burnt alive".

The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, handed over a cheque to the woman's family for £26,000 as compensation for their daughter's death.

He also announced plans to build a hospital in the village, currently some 120 miles away from proper medical facilities.

But the woman's mother said she was not interested in compensation, only the death of the vile perpetrators.

Last week five men appeared in court charged with kidnap, gang-rape and murder of the woman.

A sixth defendant, believed to be 17, faces charges in a juvenile court.

Several of the accused came from the same notorious district of Delhi, a so-called 'slum cluster' called Ravidas Camp, which has a lawless reputation.

A lawyer for three of the accused has claimed his clients have been tortured and coerced into admitting the crime.

Manohar Lal Sharma told the BBC that one of the men had been tortured for 10 days.

Mr Sharma said he plans to represent bus driver Ram Singh and his brother Mukesh as well as a third man Akshay Thakur and they planned to plead not guilty.

Today marks the end of the formal Hindu morning period for the student, after 13 days of various prayers and rituals designed to let the soul pass peacefully to the next level of existence.
