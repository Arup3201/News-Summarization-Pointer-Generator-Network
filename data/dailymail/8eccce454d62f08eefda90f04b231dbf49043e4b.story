As he gently nuzzles the nose of an RSPCA inspector, it's hard to believe anyone could abandon little Bob - the black and white puppy is one of the tiniest ever rescued by the charity.

But when he was just eight weeks old, and weighed less than a kilo, was found dumped in the car park of a veterinary practice.

Huddled by a cardboard box, he was shivering from extreme cold and in agony suffering from a ruptured eyeball.

Bad start in life: Little Bob, was just eight weeks old, and weighed less than a kilo when he was found dumped in the car park of a veterinary practice suffering from the extreme cold and a ruptured eyeball

Helping hand: RSPCA Inspector Mel Fisher, who has overseen Bob's care, said: 'He is only around eight weeks old and is probably the tiniest puppy that I have known to be abandoned'

Medics at the surgery in St Albans, Hertfordshire, claim it is a miracle Bob, who also suffered painful skin blistering and canine scabies, survived the night.

RSPCA vets took him in and, in a bid to help keep him warm, cut holes in a blue woolly hat to produce a customised knitted jumper.

Unfortunately, his condition was so bad there was nothing they could do to save the sight in one eye.

But despite the disability, Bob, has battled back to health and is happily bounding around.

He is so keen on his customised wooly clothing, he wears it when he goes outside to explore.

Bob is thought to be a crossbreed and RSPCA officers said they expected him to end up being a cross breed between terrier and chihuahua.

RSPCA Inspector Mel Fisher, who has overseen Bobâ€™s care, said: 'I cannot believe that someone would do this to such a poor innocent animal.

Lucky pup: Little Bob was handed into the RSPCA by veterinary staff, who found him abandoned in their car park on April 27

Dumped: ' I just hope we can find the person responsible for dumping him,' said RSPCA Inspector Mel Fisher

Abandoned: It is believed the unwanted pup had been dumped by its owner the previous day and left to fend for itself overnight. He was found wandering around aimlessly in the car park

'He is only around eight weeks old and is probably the tiniest puppy that I have known to be abandoned.

'He really is that small and so I was very surprised he managed to survive after the ordeal he has been through.

She said that due to his size and the bitterly cold weather he was abandoned in, that he was a 'very lucky pup to have survived.'

Mischievous: Little Bob exploring his surroundings - he is expected to be cared for by RSPCA officers until he had built up his strength and then he will be rehomed

Safe at last: Despite the disability, Bob, who is thought to be a cross-breed, has battled back to health

'He is a fighter and is pulling through and I just hope we can find the person responsible for dumping him.'
