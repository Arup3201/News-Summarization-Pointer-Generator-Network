Four years ago last Friday, Colorado hiker Zak Anderegg came across a sad scene while exploring an Arizona canyon.

After repelling 350 feet down into the heart of the gorge he found an abandoned puppy, rail thin and starving.

Thanks to Mr Anderegg's quick work, the dog named Riley survived and found a new, loving, home with his rescuer.

'He has become a cherished member of our family,' Mr Anderegg wrote on Riley's Facebook fan page. 'He is without doubt one of the sweetest dogs I've ever known.'

Mr Anderegg documented Riley's dramatic rescue on camera and the resulting footage has been viewed more than two million times on YouTube.

In the 14 minute clip, Riley is first seen eating a bowl of water and dog food that Mr Anderegg fetched after finding the abandoned pup.

'As far as I'm concerned, the only way he got here without having broken legs is someone actually put him here,' Mr Anderegg says in the footage from June 20, 2010.
