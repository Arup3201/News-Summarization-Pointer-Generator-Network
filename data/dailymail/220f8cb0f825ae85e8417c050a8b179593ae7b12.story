A woman was shot in a suspected home invasion at a residence in a upscale Beverly Hills neighbor Friday night and authorities are now searching for the suspects.

Police reportedly were called to a home in Beverly Hills about 8:30 p.m. Friday about an 'unknown trouble.'

When authorities arrived at the home in the 400 block of Doheny Drive they discovered that a woman inside had been shot and was waiting inside with her husband.

The female and male victims, described by NBCLA as being 60 and 70 years old, respectively, were taken to a nearby hospital where the husband was being evaluated and the wife was being treated for the gunshot wound.

Authorities expect the female victim to survive.

Police in the area are now searching for three male suspects in connection with the suspected home invasion and shooting.

Residents in the area were told by authorities to stay inside their homes.

According to CBSLA.com, police arrived at the scene and immediately established a perimeter.

The station reports that both K-9 units and the SWAT team was at the scene searching for the three suspects.

The home in the posh neighborhood near the historic Greystone Mansion is just blocks from a home once rented by both Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe - although, not at the same time.
