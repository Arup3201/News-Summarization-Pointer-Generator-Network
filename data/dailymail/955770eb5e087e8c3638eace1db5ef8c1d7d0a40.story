Jason Belmonte, 30, has taken to Youtube to show-off a range of bowling tricks

A video of Australia's number one bowler, Jason Belmonte, showcasing some incredible tricks has blown the minds of viewers who have sent the video viral.

With over two million views in less than a week, the video shows the 30-year-old professional achieve the impossible after teaming up with a Youtube comedy group Dude Perfect.

The video starts with an impressive double strike, where the bowler from Orange in New South Wales, aims a ball high over 12 pins stacked on top of each other before hitting the conventionally arranged pins.

Both sets of pins come tumbling down together.

But the group moved far beyond the conventional bowling alley to showcase the bowler's amazing talent.

Mr Belmonte and the group soon moved outside to a skate park to see what they could accomplish.

Astonishingly, with only one roll of the ball, Mr Belmonte bowled the ball down a ramp, up and over a second ramp before it came up a third and final ramp – knocking down a number of pins stacked together.

Setting up the scene: The video has since gone viral with over two million views in less than a week

Double strike! Mr Belmonte threw a bowling ball over a wall of 12 pins  before hitting the conventionally arranged pins just behind. With one throw, both sets of pins come tumbling down

'Normal bowlers use one hand, I use two,' the bowler who plays on the US PBA Tour said of his unique 'shovel' technique. 'Double the power, double the spin.'

Mr Belmonte's 'shovel' is a world first, with bowlers before him only ever using one hand in the sport.

Numerous times within the video, the pro bowler even lined up his friends to lie down with their heads in the lane, with one saying: 'In Jason's words, it is literally impossible for him to hit me right here.'

Luckily, or rather through a lot of skill, Jason’s words rang true, with the ball whizzing straight past them and hitting, yep you guessed it – a clean strike.

Taking it one step further: The group then moved outside to a local skate park to see what tricks they could come up with

With only one roll, Mr Belmonte bowled the ball down a ramp, up and over a second ramp before it came up a third and final ramp, knocking down a bunch of pins

But one of the most impressive tricks showcased in the video was what Jason calls the 'flying eagle'.

Setting up two lanes with one pin in each of the furtherst corners, Jason directs the bowing ball at a third pin in the left lane.

Hitting the middle pin at the exact the right angle, the ball continues on to hit one pin, while the centre pin flies across the second lane to knock down the third.

The group even successfully attempted what they believed to be 'the world’s longest strike'.

Growing up in his parent's bowling alley, Mr Belmonte said he began bowling from the young age of only 18 months.

By 16, he had won the under 18's National Masters and since then has won 20 medals all over the world.

The Flying Eagle: Set up across two lanes with one pin in each of the furthers corners, Jason managed to hit another strike by hitting a third pin at just the right angle, sending it flying across the lane to knock down another pin

So precise, Mr Belmonte gets his friends to line up in a row to prove his incredible accuracy
