Withholding the tip: The idea is contained in a new report for the mayor by Lord Darzi (pictured)

Mothers who endure appalling care in an NHS maternity unit should be able to demand that the hospital receives a punitive fine, Boris Johnson will argue this week.

The proposal, in a report commissioned by the London Mayor, is part of a drive to hand significant powers to patients – and take them away from NHS managers.

Women would be able to ensure that 12.5 per cent of the payment hospitals receive for their birth should be withheld if they were not happy with their care.

Hospitals are paid £2,200 for a normal birth, so under the proposals a woman who had a bad experience would be able to decide that £275 should be held back.

The money held back would stay with local GP commissioners who pay for care, and would be put into a fund to be re-invested in higher quality maternity services. 

The shake-up is the brainchild of Lord Darzi, a pioneering surgeon and former Labour health minister who has written the London Health Commission report for Mr Johnson.

The idea is to give new mothers the same powers over the NHS that they have in the rest of their lives, such as being able to withhold a tip if they suffer poor service in a restaurant. 

It follows mounting concern over the poor standard of NHS maternity wards, which is due in part to a shortage of at least 3,000 midwives.

Last year the chief inspector of hospitals said thousands of women in labour are forced to endure ‘shocking and frightening’ ordeals because of failings in maternity units.

A quarter of women who gave birth on the NHS last year said they were abandoned during labour and birth at a time that worried them – up from 22 per cent the year before.

Four in 10 of those polled by the Care Quality Commission said they were not happy about the quality of care they received.

Mr Johnson’s new report is written by the London Healthcare Commission, which he set up to look at ways to improve the NHS in the city – and, by extension, outside it.

It comes two months after the Mayor published a report advocating exit from the EU if David Cameron cannot persuade Brussels to hand back enough powers.

By ranging into health matters, the report will be seen as part of further leadership manoeuvres by Mr Johnson.

Last night Mark Johnson, professor of obstetrics at Chelsea and Westminster hospital, welcomed the plans.

‘Making maternity budgets more responsive to the quality of care offered to our women is important,’ he said.

‘Such a shift in emphasis will promote the development of safe, woman-centred care, based on the best available evidence.’  

In his report for Mr Johnson, Lord Darzi said: ‘Whilst the health service should always remain free at the point of need, the absence of payments from individuals is one of the reasons why care can sometimes be unresponsive to individual needs.

‘It must be possible to empower patients whilst remaining true to the NHS’s founding principle. That is why the Commission proposes to empower patients to control a proportion of the payment providers receive from NHS commissioners.

‘Personally-controlled payments would mean that individuals would be able to decide whether or not a hospital receives a portion of its income relating to that individuals’ care.’

Lord Darzi said deciding to pay would be entirely subjective and down to individual experience of care.

‘That is the point,’ she said. ‘The idea of personally-controlled payments is to make providers pay more attention to the lived experience of care.

‘They should be focused on areas of persistent poor performance.’

The report suggests the approach should be piloted in maternity care in London, where too much care is ‘stubbornly poor’.

Maternity standards in the capital are among the worst in the country. Satisfaction rates are among the lowest, and more than half of women wait at least 12 weeks for an antenatal assessment.

The maternal mortality rate in London is twice the rest of the UK, and has risen every year for the past five years. Seventy per cent of the direct maternal deaths were found to have shortfalls in care which, if managed differently, might have saved lives.

If successful, it is hoped the plan could be extended across the whole of England.

The report said: ‘Empowering mothers-to-be with personally-controlled payments for maternity care could dramatically improve their experiences of care and start a revolution in empowering Londoners in their relationship with the NHS.’

Lord Darzi was a practising cancer surgeon at St Mary’s Hospital and the Riyal Marsden Hospital, where he pioneers minimally invasive surgical techniques.

He was knighted for his services to the NHS in 2002 and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.

Gordon Brown made him a Lord in 2007 and put him in the Department of Health as a minister. He was one of Mr Brown’s so-called ‘GOATs’ – standing for ‘Government Of All the Talents’.
