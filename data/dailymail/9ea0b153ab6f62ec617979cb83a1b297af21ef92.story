A passenger was forced to the back of a plane and restrained after allegedly assaulting at least two members of cabin crew on board a flight from Manchester to Cuba, according to police.

The Thomas Cook flight was forced to divert to Bermuda after the 'drunk' man also started threatening other passengers. 

The 25-year-old man was arrested at LF Wade International Airport where dozens of officers and airport security staff were waiting on the tarmac as the plane touched down.

The man also allegedly threatened other passengers, and was  restrained aboard the Thomas Cook flight

He is currently being questioned by Bermuda Police.

The Thomas Cook flight left Manchester at 10.30am on Monday and was forced to stop in Bermuda at about 6pm.

Video footage, taken from http://bernews.com, shows the man dressed in a white T-shirt and appearing to cover his face as he is led off the plane by three police officers. 

A Thomas Cook spokesman said: 'Thomas Cook Airlines can confirm that flight TCX244 from Manchester to Holguin, Cuba, diverted to Bermuda and a customer was removed from the aircraft and detained by local police. 

'We operate a zero-tolerance policy towards any behaviour on board our aircraft that affects the safety and welfare of our customers and crew.

'We'd like to thank those customers continuing to Cuba for their patience during the short delay in Bermuda.' 

The Airbus A330 was on the ground on the North American island for around three hours before returning to the skies to complete its journey to Holguin in Cuba. 

A spokesman for the Bermudan government's Department of Airport Operations said: '(We) can confirm that a Thomas Cook Aircraft, travelling from Manchester England en route to Cuba landed in Bermuda earlier this afternoon and an unruly male passenger was taken into custody by the Bermuda Police Service. 

'The passenger is currently being detained by the Bermuda Police.' It is not yet known if the man was from Manchester. 

'He was taken to Hamilton Police Station on the island for further questioning.

A police spokesman said: 'It appears that the unruly passenger was on board creating a major commotion. The 25 year old man assaulted flight attendants and threatened to harm persons onboard the plane after he apparently consumed too much of alcohol.

'The man was forcibly taken to the rear of the aircraft where he was restrained until the flight landed in Bermuda. He then promptly arrested and taken to Hamilton Police Station where he was processed and detained.'
