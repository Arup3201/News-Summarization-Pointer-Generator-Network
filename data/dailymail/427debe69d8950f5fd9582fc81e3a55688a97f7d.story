Tough laws similar to the smoking ban should be used to crack down on over-eating and 'excessive' sex, a senior Russian political leader has declared.

The country's Duma parliament is expected to pass new regulations tomorrow banning smoking in public places.

But the country's Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky says the laws don't go far enough - and should tackle obesity and sex too.

'We need eating restrictions. Our people are overfed and too fat,' Zhirinovsky - also the parliament's deputy speaker - told local radio.

He said Russian people die earlier than the rest of the world because they eat and smoke excessively and have too much sex.

Under his plans, people would be issued with a voucher giving them permission to make love just once every three months.

'Sex should be restricted to one time per quarter through issuing licenses, quotas or coupons,' he explained.

And smokers should only be allowed to light up when they're alone in their own home or car, Zhirinovsky said.

'Smoking should be banned everywhere but in your own car if you close all the windows and stay there alone as well as in your own apartment if there is nobody else there.

'Shut all the windows and get yourself poisoned,' he declared.

'People have too much sex, they eat, smoke and drink too much and die 20 years earlier.

'Everywhere else - in Europe, America or Japan - they live longer. Why should we perish?' he added.
