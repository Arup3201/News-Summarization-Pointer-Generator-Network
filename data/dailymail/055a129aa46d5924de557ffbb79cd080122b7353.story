They told John Cantlie he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He almost always was.

In the days that followed the photojournalist’s first capture in Syria two years ago he was tortured and tormented by threats of beheading as his captors – British Islamic extremists – sharpened their knives in front of him.

The one opportunity he had to escape (it was every Englishman’s duty to try, he later explained) ended in near disaster when he and a fellow prisoner were shot and wounded, escaping death by inches. So you might have expected the much-travelled photographer, who by then had turned 40, to never go back after he was rescued by the Free Syrian Army.

Taste for adventure: John Cantlie, pictured in 2012, kept returning to war-torn regions, despite the danger

But that wasn’t in John Cantlie’s nature. ‘I’m itching to get back out there,’ he said soon after returning to the UK. ‘This is what I do.’

So he returned and in November 2012, he was captured again.

Cantlie, whose family includes a doctor, army officers and a barrister, has always had a passion for adventure.

His lifelong love of motorcycles led him to become a companion to Princes William and Harry, riding with them across Africa six years ago, and he has reported from some of the most dangerous places in the world.

At the age of 20, it wasn’t war zones that beckoned the young Cantlie, but computer games. He cut his teeth on computer game magazines in the early 1990s, when Sega was the must-have entertainment.

He moved to a motorcycle magazine before being asked to help relaunch lads’ magazine FHM. TV work and more bike magazine jobs followed before he decided he wanted to taste more action.

Daring: In an interview after his return to the UK, Mr Cantlie said that he was 'itching' to return to Syria

One fellow photographer said: ‘He wasn’t the kind of guy everybody knew. He seemed to like to work on his own, be his own boss. When they released that first picture of him after he was freed … there were only a couple of photographers I knew from national newspapers who recognised him.’

Perhaps it was because Cantlie preferred freelancing to being tied to working as a staff photographer. He could boast an impressive list of publications and TV outlets that commissioned or used his work, including the Sunday Times, Sunday Telegraph, Sun, Guardian and BBC.

One of his major published despatches from a war zone came in 2010 when the Sunday Times ran a story headlined ‘Dodging the bombs in a Kevlar coffin’, a reference to his journey on of Afghanistan’s most notoriously dangerous roads in an armoured vehicle, with a US infantry battalion.

Captured: Mr Cantlie, who returned to Syria in 2012, is now being held hostage by Islamic State militants

It must have seemed a holiday a few months later when he joined Olympic athletes training for the Games.

Two months later, he was back in the desert. On July 19, 2012, he crossed into Syria from Turkey. 

He and Dutch journalist Jeroen Oerlemans, walked into a rebel camp and identified themselves, expecting to be welcomed. It took Cantlie only a split second to realise they were in big trouble.

The camp was run by jihadists, many British, with links to al-Qaeda. It was seven harrowing days, during which both men came to believe they would be executed, before they were freed by Syrian opposition fighters.
