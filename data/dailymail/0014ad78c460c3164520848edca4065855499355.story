Wrestling to rip-off fiendishly sticky paper airline luggage tags could become a thing of the past.

British Airways has begun customer-trials of new re-useable digital bag-tags.

The personalised electronic tags eliminate the need for a new paper version every time you fly and are now being tested by passengers flying in and out of Heathrow’s Terminal 5.

BA’s electronic bag-tag can be used by passengers who have their booking details sent to their smart-phone using the British Airways app.

British Airways is trialling new electronic bag-tags, which could replace traditional sticky paper ones

Guinea-pig passengers will use their smartphone to check in, choose their seat and obtain their mobile boarding pass.

The app then automatically updates the digital bag-tag with a unique barcode, containing new flight details and an easy-to-see view of their bag’s destination just by holding the phone over it.

Each time the passenger flies, the electronic bar code on the tag changes.

Employees from software giant Microsoft using Nokia Lumia Windows Phones have been selected to take part as the first passenger guinea-pigs in the month-long trial.

Each electronic bag-tag carries a special computer chip and has two small mini-computer screens on each side, similar to those on an iPhone or Kindle ‘e-reader’ device. 

At check-in, passengers hold their smartphone, carrying their booking details, over the tag. The phone then transmits these details wirelessly to the tag, which then displays them on the mini-screens in the form of a bar-code and in summary form as written words.

The electronic screens ‘fix’ the image on the tag for the duration of the trip – allowing it to be scanned electronically when going through luggage handling at departure, on to the plane, and through to the luggage collection carousel in the arrivals.

Only when the customer checks onto a new flight will the bar code be changed and updated for that service.

BA said the new system will be quicker and more efficient than the traditional paper tag

BA said the hi-tech tag can be used ‘time and time again’ with a different bar-code programmed for each new flight. The battery switches off once the image is ‘fixed’ and will last around five years.

A BA spokesman said: ’Once checked in, customers just need to hold their smartphone over theelectronic tag, which automatically updates with a unique barcode containing their flight details and an easy-to-see view of their bag’s destination.’

The company said the new system will be quicker and more efficient than the old paper tags.

’It means customers save precious time by having their electronic tag quickly scanned at the bag drop, going straight through security to relax before catching their flight,’ the spokesman said.

‘The digital bag tag contains all a customer’s baggage details and could eventually do away with the need for a new paper tag every time you fly.

‘Comprehensive testing of the tag has already taken place to make sure it works in a live airport environment and can stand up to the rigours of airport baggage systems and everyday travel.’

Glenn Morgan, British Airways’ head of services, said: ‘The customer trials take us another step closer to making the personalised digital bag tag a reality for our customers. We’re grateful for Microsoft’s support during the trial, which will help us shape the future of checking in for flights.’

He added: ‘British Airways has a long history of innovation. The digital bag tag is a tangible demonstration of our commitment to developing new technology and holds the promise of making checking in for flights even quicker and smoother’.

Guinea-pig passengers will use their smartphone to check in, choose their seat and obtain their mobile boarding pass

British Airways’ managing director for customers, Frank van der Post, said: ‘This is a fantastically simple, yet smart device that gives each customer the choice to have their own personalised electronic baggage tag that changes with the swipe of a smartphone – every time they fly.’

The electronic tags have been developed by British Airways in partnership Densitron Displays, and Designworks Windsor. Heathrow Airport is also helping with the trials.

BA said that over the next five years  it is investing more than £5billion in new technology, including  its first new Airbus A380 ‘superjumbo’, which arrives next month.
