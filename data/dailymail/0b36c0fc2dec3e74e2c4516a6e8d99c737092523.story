Kendall Jenner has been accused of Photoshopping a recent Instagram post, which featured her posing in a bikini while on holiday in Dubai. 

The selfie, which was posted on New Year's Day, shows the 19-year-old standing in front of a mirror in her hotel room, presumably as she was getting ready to head out to the pool or beach. 

But while many of Kendall's 17 million followers rushed to praise her trim and toned physique, others pointed out some suspicious-looking wavy lines in the bottom left corner of the picture, suggesting that they are signs the image has been edited.  

'What are those weird wavy bits in the corner?' one commented, while another said: 'This has definitely been edited!

Warped? Instagram users have pointed out some suspicious-looking wavy lines in the bottom left corner of Kendall Jenner's recent selfie

'Why alter a flawless bod?' Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton questioned why the 19-year-old would feel the need to edit her images

'Look at the weird distortion at the bottom. And her waist looks weird too.'

Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton was also quick to point out the seemingly edited aspects of the picture, commenting: 'Maybe it's just the angle, but if you look along the very bottom of the picture, you'll see what looks like warping. 

'Even the frame of the window seems to be bent inward a little — and WHAT is going on with Kendall's wrist?

'If it is Photoshop, all we can ask is: why alter a perfectly flawless bod?'

One reader added: 'Don't know much about Photoshop but think the picture is doctored, because her arm is so skinny she looks like she has rickets or something.'

But Daily Mail Online's picture director was slightly more skeptical about the Photoshop claims, saying: 'If she were to have Photoshopped anything it would not be that section of the frame that would be warped. 

'I see that slight warping referred to on the window sill, but wouldn't she alter an area that was either on the other side or higher up and not near her wrist for a better effect? I think it is just the angle of the photo myself and that she looks amazing.' 

Trim and toned: Kendall frequently flaunts her enviable figure in a series of crop tops, be it on the catwalk (L) or at home (R)

Kendall, who celebrated the start of the New Year with a luxury getaway in Dubai alongside close friends Selena Gomez, Gigi Hadid and Cody Simpson, is certainly not shy about showing off her impressive figure. 

The Estee Lauder model frequently flaunts her toned tummy and enviable waistline on social media and is frequently seen out and about in a number of midriff-baring ensembles. 

But this is the first time that the rising fashion star has been accused of altering an image in order to make herself appear skinnier, and many fans are bemused as to why she thinks any editing would ever be necessary. 

'Kendall you are so beautiful never change anything about yourself,' one fan commented on the Instagram snap.

'This photo is everything, Kendall you are perfect,' another added. 

It is not the first time that a celebrity has been accused of altering their social media images; in April last year, singer Beyonce came under fire from fans after posting a picture of herself playing golf, which they suggested had been edited in order to emphasize her 'thigh gap'. 

Controversy: Kendall's close friend Selena Gomez has also faced heavy criticism from fans after she posted this picture of herself flashing her ankles in a mosque. The image has since been removed from Instagram

At the time, one fan wrote on Twitter: 'really @Beyonce? we all love your thick thighs. NO reason to photoshop a thigh gap in there..' 

And Kendall is not the only one of her friends to have posted a controversial snap during their Dubai holiday. 

Yesterday, singer Selena Gomez removed a picture of herself flashing her ankles at Abu Dhabi's Grand Mosque from her Instagram account after fans accused her of being 'insensitive' and 'disrespectful' of the country's strict dress code.

Commenting on the picture, Instagram user Alaa Almitwally said: 'Disrecpectful! It's a religion place not a place to have fun in, so disappointed.'

Meanwhile another user, Ayisha Elturk, said: 'If their intent was to learn about Islam they wouldn't be posing like they were standing outside and amusement park.

'I like Selena Gomez but to have her do something like this makes me no longer a fan.'
