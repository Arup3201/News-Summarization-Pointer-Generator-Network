New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's shot at the White House took another hit this weekend when he angered a key Republican donor with a comment about Israel.

Christie was one of three governors and potential 2016 candidates to speak at the Republican Jewish Coalition's spring meeting in Las Vegas on Saturday.

Hoping to court the financial support of billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, Christie spoke fondly about his 2012 trip to Israel, which was paid in part by the RJC.

Someone didn't do their homework: Christie (left) was forced to apologize to billionaire Republican party donor Sheldon Adelson (right) after a speech on Saturday in which he referred to the areas of Israel inhabited by Palestinians as 'occupied territories'

'I took a helicopter ride from the occupied territories across, and just felt personally how extraordinary that was, to understand the military risk that Israel faces every day,' he said.

But Christie's use of the term 'occupied territories' angered many in the room. 

Christie was referring to the areas inhabited by Palestinians such as the West Bank or Golan Heights, where Israel maintains a military presence.

Many conservative Zionists find the term 'occupied territories' offensive since they believe Israel has a legitimate claim on the lands.

Impressed: It was during that trip that Christie had the opportunity to meet President Benjamin Netanyahu and the governor said he was 'extraordinarily taken by his strength and resolve'.

Morton Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America, told Politico that he confronted Christie after his speech.

Klein says he told Christie he should have 'at minimum' referred to the areas  as 'disputed territories'.

'Chris Christie either does not understand the issues surrounding Israel, or he's hostile to Israel,' Klein told NorthJersey.com.

After the speech, Christie personally apologized to Adelson in a private meeting at the mogul's office at the Venetian hotel and casino.

A source told Politico that Christie 'clarified in the strongest terms possible that his remarks today were not meant to be a statement of policy.'

Christie also made it clear 'that he misspoke when he referred to the "occupied territories". And he conveyed that he is an unwavering friend and committed supporter of Israel, and was sorry for any confusion that came across as a result of the statement'.

The source says Adelson accepted the apology.

But other than his 'occupied territories' slip up, Christie's speech was the most celebrated of the evening, receiving three standing ovations from the 400-person crowd.

Republican governors Scott Walker of Wisconsin and John Kasich of Ohio also spoke at the meeting.

Adelson personally skipped all of Walker's speech, and showed up six minutes into Christie speech, to sit front and center.

In his speech, Christie took a hard stance in support of Israel, calling out President Obama's wavering support for the nation.

'We cannot have a world where our friends are unsure of whether we'll be with them, and our enemies are unsure whether we'll be against them,' he said.

He also spoke highly of Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he met on his 2012 trip.

Christie said he was 'extraordinarily taken by [Netayahu's] strength and resolve'.
