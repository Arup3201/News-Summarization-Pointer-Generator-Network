It’s three decades since Magic Johnson started shooting in the NBA, while Sean ‘P. Diddy’ Combs released his first record 15 years ago.

Now the sporting and music icons are both set to enter the TV industry by launching their own U.S. networks over the next two years.

The ideas are bullish as celebrity networks are far from a guaranteed success, given the poor ratings plaguing the Oprah Winfrey Network.

New ideas: NBA star Magic Johnson, left, and rapper Sean ‘P. Diddy’ Combs, right,  are both set to enter the TV industry by launching their own U.S. networks

‘We'll learn from those who have gone before us,’ Johnson told the LA Times. ‘We understand the landscape and we will run a sound business.’

Former L.A. Lakers star Johnson said ‘Aspire’ will feature positive images of African-Americans, be aimed at black viewers and launched in June.

It will ‘encourage and challenges African-Americans to reach for their dreams’ and ‘celebrate our heritage and achievements,’ said Johnson, 52.

‘I’m most excited about Aspire creating opportunities for the new voices, new visions and the next generation of storytellers,’ he added.

Johnson - enshrined in the Basketball 
Hall of Fame in 2002 - wants a mix of film, TV, music, comedy, 
performing arts and faith shows on Aspire.

Big idea: Ex-Los Angeles Lakers star Johnson said 'Aspire' will be launched in June, feature positive images of African-Americans and is aimed at black viewers

He also wants the 24-hour channel to 
also offer opportunities for black people who have struggled to find 
work in mainstream Hollywood.

Johnson was a three-time NBA most-valuable player and his astonishing success on the court has almost been matched off it.

The five-time NBA champion and communications graduate runs a charitable foundation and is chairman of the holding company behind Vibe magazine.

Johnson may find strong competition in Black Entertainment Television, which is the most-viewed TV network targeting young African-Americans.

Meanwhile Grammy award-winning rapper Combs is planning to launch the ‘Revolt’ network with MTV veteran Andy Schuon next year.

Tricky business: The ideas are bullish as celebrity networks are far from a guaranteed success, given the poor ratings plaguing the Oprah Winfrey Network

‘Revolt is the first channel created 
entirely from the ground up in this new era of social media,’ said 
Combs, once known as Puff Daddy.

'Revolt will be live, like all great moments in television history (and) immediate, like today’s social networks'

‘Revolt will be live, like all great moments in television history,’ he added. ‘It will also be immediate, like today’s social networks.’

It will have programming that includes music videos, live performances, music news and interviews and Combs wants to put artists in charge.

The channels were both announced as part
of a package of four minority- owned networks being launched by Comcast
on its cable TV systems.

Others include El Rey, proposed by 
Hollywood director Robert Rodriguez and FactoryMade Ventures executives 
John Fogelman and Cristina Patwa.

Other ideas: An entertainment. channel proposed by Hollywood director Robert Rodriguez, pictured, is for Latino and general audiences

Rodriguez is known for the ‘Spy Kids’ films and the network for Latino and general audiences is being billed as 'action-packed'.

Meanwhile a fourth network is BabyFirst Americas, from Spanish-language TV veteran Constantino ‘Said’ Schwarz, for infants and young children.

It will emphasise the importance of early development of verbal, maths and learning to perform movements, the network said.

Winfrey's network has been plagued by weak ratings and internal shifts, and she took over as CEO last July in attempt to refocus its direction.

There were attempts to get back ratings with comedian Rosie O'Donnell's show launched in October, but that soon lost half its audience to 200,000.
