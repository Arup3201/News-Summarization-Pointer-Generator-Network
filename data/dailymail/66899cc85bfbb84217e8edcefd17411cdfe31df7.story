Passengers on flight MH370 died of oxygen starvation hours before the pilot performed a controlled ditching in the Indian Ocean, according to a new study into the disaster.

Analysis by a veteran air accident investigator suggests that all 239 people lost consciousness up to four hours before the Boeing 777 disappeared beneath the waves.

The most likely scenario is that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately depressurised the cabin, thereby depriving those on board of air, the research concludes.

Theory: Geoff Taylor (left) and Ewan Wilson who have written a book which claims the pilot of MH370 cut off the oxygen supply to the passengers before deliberately crashing into the Indian Ocean

Although oxygen masks would have dropped down automatically from above the seats, their supply was limited to just 20 minutes.

Those unable to grab a mask, including sleeping passengers, would have passed out within the space of a few minutes.

The entire 'ghost plane' - including her cabin crew whose air supply is only marginally longer, would have slipped into a coma and died shortly after from oxygen starvation.

Ahmad Shah, who locked his co-pilot out of the cockpit, survived long enough - either by repressurising the aircraft or from breathing his own, more extensive air supply - to evade radar and 'execute his master plan', researchers have concluded.

He then performed a controlled ditching in the sea, which would explain why no debris has been found because the plane landed and sank in one piece.

'Mentally ill': The book claims the most likely scenario is that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah (above) deliberately depressurised the cabin then flew for another three hours before ditching into the sea

The theory is the result of the first independent study into March's disaster by the New Zealand-based air accident investigator, Ewan Wilson.

Wilson, the founder of Kiwi Airlines 
and a commercial pilot himself, arrived at the shocking conclusion after
 considering 'every conceivable alternative scenario'.

However, he has not been able to provide any conclusive evidence to support his theory.

An earlier report from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) also concluded that passengers may have died from hypoxia.

And Malaysian authorities previously named Ahmad Shah as their prime suspect.

The
 remarkable claims are made in the book 'Goodnight Malaysian 370', the 
culmination of a four-month study into the incident, which Wilson 
co-wrote with the New Zealand broadsheet journalist, Geoff Taylor.

Wilson,
 a qualified transport safety investigator, said: 'One of our objectives
 in writing this book was, in some small way, to convey the human 
stories of the tragedy.

'Our
 other, more important task was to pursue the truth about what really 
happened; that is one small contribution we felt we could make to this 
whole, terrible affair.

'We could never have foreseen the information we uncovered, or their implications.

'Neither could we have imagined the horrific scenario that our research suggests took place on board that fateful plane.'

Wilson and Taylor's entire scenario makes for difficult reading.

They
 believe that Ahmad Shah, who they have concluded was suffering from 
mental illness, tricked his co-pilot Fariq Hamid into taking a break 
about 40 minutes after take-off.

After
 locking Hamid out of the cockpit, Ahmad Shah made his last broadcast to
 air traffic control - 'Goodnight, Malaysian 370' - before switching off
 the aircraft's air-to-ground communication links.

Alone
 at the controls, he took MH370 up to 39,000 feet and de-pressurised the
 aircraft, giving passengers and crew less than 60 seconds of Time of 
Useful Consciousness (TUC).

Search
 continues: Officials claim they are 'making progress' as they continue 
to scour 60,000 sq km of sea for the plane. The orange line indicates 
'high priority' search areas; the yellow has been searched already

Ahmad
 Shah could not have prevented the plane's oxygen masks from 
automatically dropping down or an automated emergency announcement in 
English.

But Flight 370 was a
 night flight and, with the cabin lights off, the majority of passengers
 would have been asleep, or close to it.

And for 227 of the 239 passengers, English was not their first language.

Cabin crew would have tried to help those on board, but would have had to have donned their own facemasks first.

'It would have been a frightening and confusing time throughout the cabin,' Taylor said.

'By
 the time some of the passengers had woken up groggy, heard the 
commotion and looked around in confusion, it would have been too late 
for them.

'Those passengers 
who did not react within 60 seconds or less would have lapsed into 
unconsciousness and death would have followed within four to six 
minutes.'

 effort: Australia's deputy prime minister Warren Truss unveiled the 
latest search plan at a press conference in Canberra earlier this month. The
 government has contracted a new firm to take up the search

Those who had found a mask would have had between 12 and 22 minutes of breathing time before blacking out.

The cabin crew's oxygen supply would have lasted for about 70 minutes, depending upon the height of the aircraft.

By the time MH370 returned to cruising altitude, everyone on board would have perished.

Ahmad Shah would have had three hours' worth of oxygen - plenty enough, the authors believe, to carry out the 'final act of his performance'.

They conclude that he set a course for the southern Indian Ocean and, after the fuel ran dry, glided the aircraft for a further 100 nautical miles before performing a controlled ditching on the surface of the water.

Wilson, a trained commercial pilot, said: 'Ahmad Shah was a man known for his methodical, thorough nature, for his love of the technical, and probably for his ego, too.

'This would have been his final sad act to his family and to the world: "find this one".'
