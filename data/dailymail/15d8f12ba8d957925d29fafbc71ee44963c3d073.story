The team behind the latest awareness campaign from breast cancer charity CoppaFeel! were forced to find billboards away from roads - to make sure drivers weren't distracted by bare chests on show.

The images, which will also appear in magazines and shop changing rooms, feature 'real' women who posed topless in support of the new #whatnormalfeelslike campaign. 

But sites for the billboards, unveiled today at sites in Liverpool and Glasgow, had to be carefully chosen in order to make sure they didn't breach advertising rules - or cause car crashes.

The photographs, which are broadcast on massive high-resolution screens, show the bare breasts of 24 'real' women. Each image is printed with a word the women used to describe their chest.

Guidelines set by industry watchdog the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) say that bare breasts should not be published in a sexualised manner. 

They should also not be published in a way that might offend children, or someone's religious beliefs.

As it was not an advert, the CoppaFeel! campaign fell into a 'grey area' when it comes to the code, explained Caitlin Ryan, executive creative director at advertising agency Karmarama that worked on the project.

According to codes set by the Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP), advertisements must not contain anything that is likely to cause serious or widespread offence.

This includes publishing adverts that may be deemed 'overly sexual', and those which may offend someone for religious reasons. 

Particular attention is paid to children, and the code urges advertisers to consider whether their publication exposes children to 'irresponsible sexual imagery'. 

While there is no set definition as to what this means, examples given by the Advertising Standards Authority - the body that enforces the CAP code - include images of posing seductively in lingerie or skimpy swimwear. 

In addition to these rules, charities are also given rules to stop them taking advantage of people's kindness and impulse to give to charity.

But the team still had to work to minimise the offense it could potentially cause - and therefore the risk of the advert being removed.

Ms Ryan told MailOnline: 'The challenge here is that outdoor advertising is a broadcast medium so it is difficult to restrict who will see a particular billboard site so the risk was that the level of nudity could be deemed unsuitable for children or cause offense on religious grounds.

'It therefore became a careful balancing act between avoiding causing offense but getting the important empowerment message to our audience.'

The conflict led the team to seek out locations in three shopping centres, Westfield Point, Liverpool Cavern Quarter, Glasgow Enoch Square, and Westfield London - which launches next month.

Based on data provided by media company Ocean Outdoor, the team found the spots had high footfall of their target audience, young women, and were visited by very few children.

Crucially, the locations are all also away from the road so they avoid distracting drivers.

The billboards are the second phase in a nationwide campaign. The first set, launched last October, featured seven bare-chested women, photographed by British photographer Rankin. 

While the first campaign received CAP approval, the team were cautioned in featuring images of bare breasts across billboards. It received no complaints. 

It is not yet known whether the Advertising Standards Agency received any complaints relating to the new billboards. 

Founders: Twins Kris and Maren Hallenga, pictured last year, who founded CoppaFeel! after Kris was diagnosed with breast cancer

Breast cancer awareness charity CoppaFeel! was founded by 28-year-old identical twins Kris and Maren Hallenga, after their lives were turned upside down in 2009.

That year, when the girls were just 23, Kris was diagnosed with breast cancer -  eight months after first going to her GP with concerns about lumps she was finding in her painful chest.

Dismissed as 'hormones' and told she was far too young to have the disease, the cancer went undiagnosed for so long that it spread to her spine, only finally diagnosed when the twins' no-nonsense mother marched Kris to the doctor and demanded to be taken seriously.

Kris was – and remains – at stage four, the most advanced type of cancer. There is no stage five.

Straight away, Kris was thrown into a routine of radiotherapy, five months of chemotherapy, and yet more radiotherapy.

She made it her mission to encourage other young people to get to know their breasts so that they might be able to detect any lumps early. 

Kris and Maren founded CoppaFeel! just one month after Kris' diagnosis.

Kris is not cancer free – and perhaps never will be. But she’s keeping as well as she can, being treated at the hospital each month.
