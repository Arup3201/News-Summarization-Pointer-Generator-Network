One half of an infamous pair of identity thieves dubbed ‘Bonnie and Clyde’ has found herself back behind bars.

Jocelyn Kirsch, 28, has been detained at a federal prison in Philadelphia after violating her probation by shoplifting two years ago in California and failing to pay restitution for her previous crimes.

The brunette and then-boyfriend Edward Anderton rose to infamy in 2007 after being convicted of stealing almost $120,000 from friends and neighbors to spend on vacations, clothing, jewelry and other luxuries including $2,000 hair extensions.

Kirsch, living in California since being released from prison in 2011, was busted in 2012 for shoplifting clothes from Banana Republic, BCBG, J. Crew and Nordstrom’s stores in a Walnut Creek Mall, according to the Philadelphia Daily News.

She was observed by a Nordstrom employee carrying multiple items of clothing and an expensive Tory Burch handbag before going into a dressing room and emerging without any of the clothes, according to a 2012 report filed by the U.S. Probation Office cited by the paper.

The employee said she then placed the designer clutch on a chair and left the store before returning and taking it without paying, according to the report.

She copped to stealing both the purse and a dress she damaged by removing a sensor when returned to the store by a staff member.

Questioning by police led her to further admit stealing about $318 worth of clothing from Banana Republic that she had in a shopping bag she was holding. The store declined to prosecute because the thefts were not witnessed by a store employee, the report said.

Further investigation led police to find further stolen items in her car.

‘Kirsch admitted to stealing some of the merchandise and claimed it was stolen several weeks earlier,’ said the report. Neither J. Crew, nor BCBG pressed charges either.

But Nordstrom’s did.

The terms of her parole forbid her from committing any more crimes. Kirsch’s conviction landed another year in jail and in violation of that parole.

She also failed to make any of the court-ordered $250 monthly restitution payments to the victims of a scam that saw her and Anderton opening credit cards, writing checks and even just stealing cash from others.

They spent the money on lavish vacations to the Caribbean, Hawaii, Europe and even Morocco, according to The Guardian.

Anderton and Kirsch dined in the best restaurants and attended the most exclusive parties. They flaunted their excess on Facebook and in Philadelphia’s society pages – their conspicuous lifestyle led to their downfall.

‘Jocelyn and Ed made performance art out of their extravagance,’ said the Guardian in a scathing account of the couple’s scam.

They were busted after writing phony checks to a Philadelphia salon for those costly hair extensions. A little digging by the stylist led her to a postal box rented at UPS Store on the campus of Drexel University, where Kirsch was a student.

She helped police set up a sting operation claiming the girl had left a textbook at the salon, the pair refused to meet the woman but made the mistake of threatening her to back off, police told the Guardian.

‘You don't know my name but I know yours. I also know ur nice place on wolf st and how u get home at night (sic),’ read a text message sent to the stylist by the thieves.

‘Youre (sic) the one who should be worried... you seem like a smart girl, walk away now or you will regret it.’

It's all gone: The pair are now separated and live on opposite sides of the country

They were arrested retrieving a package of lingerie delivered to the post box but addressed to their across-the-hall neighbor.

Police soon burst into their luxurious downtown apartment to find an extensive identity theft operation.

Evidence recovered included a professional ID maker, computer spyware and lock-picking tools, police told the Guardian.

The scheme was so elaborate that removing Anderton’s computer from the apartment caused the entire building’s internet access to go down, authorities said.

Kirsch told a packed courtroom during her 2008 sentencing that her ‘regret runs bone deep and she will never repeat this mistake again,’ according to KYW.

That was just another con for what appears to be a career criminal.

She was sentenced to five years in prison, Anderton received four. Both were released early on good behavior - Kirsch only three years and five months into her sentence in November 2011.

A Monday court hearing will determine how long her latest transgressions will land her in the slammer.
