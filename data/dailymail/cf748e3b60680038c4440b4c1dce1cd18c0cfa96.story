Last year was a big year for Michelle Palmer – not least because she gave birth to her second child – and she captured it all on camera to treasure the memories forever. 

But the 300 photos were lost forever when the memory card they were saved on blew away into the sand during a trip to the beach. Or so she thought. 

A year later, seven-year-old Jake Holdaway was building sandcastles on the very same beach, when he came across the treasured card.

Treasure: Seven year old Jake Holdaway, managed to find a memory card on the beach at West Wittering as he walked with his dad

Arriving home, his father Wesley loaded it on to the family computer and up popped 270 pictures and some video footage.

Mr Holdaway, 35, a plumber, then embarked on an extraordinary hunt for the family in the pictures.

First, he posted a couple of the pictures on social networking sites, asking friends if they could help him track the family down.

He said: ‘I had no luck so I began to zoom in on the photos and listen to the videos to see if anything could tell me who they were. 

‘I noticed the little girl had a tag on her leg when she was born so I zoomed in and it said “daughter of Michelle Palmer”.

‘I spent hours trailing through all of the Michelle Palmers on Facebook but nothing matched.

Found: Michelle Palmer thought that this photo of her with her daughter Amber when she was born was lost

‘It got on my nerves so I carried on looking through and saw the little boy in the photos had a school jumper on.’

At that point Mr Holdoway, who lives in Banstead, Surrey with his wife and two children, rang the Brighton school on the jumper and told the receptionist about his search. 

‘She told me to send her a picture of the child and to find out who it is. Then she said “Out of interest, what is the mother’s name?” I told her and she said “Oh my god that’s my next door neighbour”.

‘Next thing I knew I got a call from Michelle who was over the moon and I sent her the pictures in the post.’

Jake, who found the memory card, said: ‘I was just digging and kicking 
the sand around. I didn’t know what it was and it was time to go so I 
showed my dad and he told me what it was.’ 

The seven-year-old, who is at primary school, and loves football and 
cricket, said he was on his Easter holidays and had his bucket and spade
with him.

Precious: Another photo that was saved, of Michelle Palmer's daughter Amber with her late great Grandmother Jackie Meacock

He had never found anything unusual before in the sand, ‘it was just pure luck’, his father said.

Miss Palmer said: ‘The memory card must have blown away in the wind because it was so windy and I was really gutted. I have a really bad memory so photos are everything to me.’

The photos – taken up until May last year – included pictures of her pregnant, photos of her baby Amber after being born, and photos of her daughter’s first Christmas.

There were also videos of her son Jacob, 6, and Amber, now 21 months, visiting Father Christmas and videos of Amber making her first cooing noises.

One of the most treasured memories was a video of Amber with Miss Palmer’s grandmother Jackie Meacock who hit the headlines when she ended her own life in a Dignitas clinic in Switzerland.

Miss Palmer said: ‘It was a very special video of my nan as she died in September last year. She is filmed holding Amber in her flat and having a conversation.’

She said she received a call from the receptionist at Jacob’s school on a Monday a few weeks ago when he was off sick.

She added: ‘I was a bit freaked out and thought that is so weird but I called him straight away.

‘When I received the pictures it made me feel so happy and relieved’.
