A third of people have no idea that Charles Dickens wrote Great Expectations, a worrying survey of reading habits has revealed

A third of people have no idea who wrote Great Expectations, a worrying survey of reading habits has revealed.

One in six were also unable to name the genius behind Hamlet.

Dickens and Shakespeare are not the only major authors to fall out of favour with large sections of the population - 28 per cent of adults admitted never having read one of the classics.

One in seven revealed they hadn’t read a single book over the past 12 months.

The findings suggest not only that many people have managed to complete their education without study any classical literature in detail but that the habit continues into adulthood.

Just 12 per cent have read Much Ado About Nothing, 18 per cent Catcher in the Rye and only 26 per cent have picked up Pride and Prejudice - despite its enormous popularity as prime time television drama and in the cinema.

A quarter of adults have read fewer than five books over the past year and the average gets through seven, according to the survey of 2,000 people.

Half of those who complete fewer than ten books every year blamed lack of time and a quarter said they had more interesting things to do.

Around one in eight said they were a slow reader and a similar proportion simply said they didn’t like reading.

Bedtime is when most people pick up a book, with just under half finding time when they’re between the sheets. A third catch up on reading while on holiday.

Only a quarter said they flick through a few pages whenever they get a chance.

The favourite genre is thrillers (30 per cent), followed by crime novels (26 per cent). Romance novels are favoured by 16 per cent - although this comprises 29 per cent of women and just two per cent of men.

The most popular book from contemporary literature is the Da Vinci Code, which 36 per cent of people have read. The Harry Potter series came second with 28 per cent.

James Endersby, managing director of Opinium Research, which carried out the survey, said: ‘Unfortunately for many people, reading is now a luxury and something which they cannot commit a great deal of time to.

‘Over the summer, many will have taken the opportunity to relax with a good book and have hopefully reminded themselves how much they enjoy reading. What would be great is if everyone decided to pick one classic book to read during the winter months.’

Modular exams have allowed pupils to read sections of books instead of the entire work.

But Education Secretary Michael Gove is changing the curriculum and introducing end-of-course exams that will be more rigorous.

Secondary school pupils will be required to study at least two Shakespeare plays and a 19th-century novel at GCSE and cover the works of two authors in depth each year.

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘New GCSEs will demand that students read whole texts.

‘The exams’ specification will mean pupils read a wide range of classic literature fluently and in depth, developing their understanding of English literary heritage.’
