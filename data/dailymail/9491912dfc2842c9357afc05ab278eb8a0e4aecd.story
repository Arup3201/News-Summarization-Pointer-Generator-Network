David Cameron and wife Samantha have agreed to switch on family-friendly internet filters at their homes to protect their three children from online pornography.

The Prime Minister insisted yesterday husbands and wives would have to have difficult conversations about whether or not they want to block adult content.

At a Downing Street summit on protecting children online, internet firms confirmed that all 20 million households connected to the internet are to be asked whether they want filters installed.

Sources said Mr Cameron had already decided to install parental controls – and believes it is right that all couples make an ‘active choice’ between them on whether to do the same.

Mr Cameron said it was up to each family to make their own decision, but suggested that he thought those with children should opt to block adult material.

The filters will apply to all devices linked to a home wi-fi network and across public networks where children are likely to be present.

Adult content filters are expected to be fitted to all new mobile phones.

Only an adult will be able to switch the filter on and off and the account holder will receive a confirmation email. Some providers are also offering text alerts, in case children hack into the account. 

The UK’s biggest internet service providers, who are responsible for connections in about 95 per cent of homes, agreed to sign up to the scheme after months of discussion with the Government.

The Daily Mail – which yesterday exclusively revealed a crackdown by Google and Microsoft on web searches for child porn – has campaigned to make family-friendly filters ‘default on’ to protect children.

There has been growing alarm at evidence that a third of youngsters have accessed online pornography by the time they are ten years old.

Six in ten parents now say they are worried about their sons and daughters seeing violent and sexual material on the web.

However, the Government’s initiative has been criticised by some, including planning minister Nick Boles, who argued adults should be free to enjoy ‘legal’ pornography without lecturing from ministers.

‘As a Conservative, my starting point is that people should be free to live their lives as they choose.

I am not going to start lecturing consenting adults about their private enjoyment of legal pornography,’ Mr Boles said. But Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 2: ‘I’m not lecturing in that way. 

‘What I’m saying is that as a parent and as a politician, I think other parents would welcome the fact that when you sign up to an online account, you get a prompt so that you have to think about whether you want an internet in your house where your children can sometimes accidentally or on purpose search for pornographic images.’ 

He added: ‘It’s certainly not lecturing people on what to do, it’s helping them with something that people continually say to me “we’d like some help with”.’ 

Mr Cameron was challenged over how couples will agree on web access, if a husband wants the filters switched off and a wife wants to block pornography.

The Prime Minister said: ‘Well, they’re going to have to have a discussion, aren’t they? 

‘The fact is, I think what ought to happen here and what is going  to happen now is when you sign up to an internet service provider … you are prompted with an online message which is, there are these pornography filters that are switched on.

‘If you want to keep them, go ahead, particularly if you’ve got children in the house. If you want to take them off, you have to make an active choice.’

Mr Cameron described the move, supported by Virgin Media, TalkTalk, BSkyB and BT, as ‘real progress’ for parents.

In a further effort to tackle online paedophiles, Britain’s National Crime Agency is joining America’s FBI in a task force to target those who use encrypted networks. London will host an international summit on the issue next year.

The Government also plans to change the law so that anyone found with pornography depicting rape could be jailed for up to three years.

Google confirmed yesterday it will block internet search results linked to child abuse and has developed a way of tagging illegal videos across the web.

Microsoft is implementing similar changes.
