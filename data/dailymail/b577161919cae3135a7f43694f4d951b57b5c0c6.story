Sam Allardyce’s future at West Ham appears to be hanging by a thread after co-chairman David Gold took the remarkable step of ‘favouriting’ a derogatory message about the under-fire manager on Twitter.

Allardyce has been made aware of the fact that Gold, who has 92,000 followers on Twitter, was sent a message by a Hammers fan that read: ‘Is today the day we get rid of BFS?? Fingers crossed.’

'BFS' is a derogatory reference to Allardyce and Gold’s decision to ‘favourite’ the message has only intensified the speculation that Allardyce’s time at Upton Park may be up before the season has even begun.

Divisive: Allardyce wants to move Ravel Morrison on but co-chairman Sullivan wants to offer him a contract

Allardyce,
 who was warned at the end of last season that the owner’s wanted an 
improved style of football, has recently clashed with Gold and the other
 co-chairman David Sullivan over midfielder Ravel Morrison who has become a peripheral figure under Big Sam but who Sullivan wants to offer a new contract.

David Gold's daughter Jacqueline added further intrigue to events at West Ham by tweeting: 'Great to see @davidgold back home after trip to NZ with the team & especially looking forward to the football news at dinner tomorrow night.'

Sullivan has also insisted that the record signing of Andy Carroll was a huge mistake.

The
 striker will miss at least three months of the season with an ankle 
injury and Sullivan revealed that he regretted ‘putting all his eggs in 
one basket’ by signing the England international.

Allardyce came under renewed fire after his side were defeated in both their games on a tour of New Zealand.
