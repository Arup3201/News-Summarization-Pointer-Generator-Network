Cancer costs Britain's economy more than £11billion a year in healthcare, including visits to doctors and medication

Cancer costs Britain’s economy more than £11billion a year in healthcare and time off work while sufferers fight the disease.

Researchers say the economic cost of cancer reaches almost £100billion every year in Europe, with lung cancer battering the economy most overall.

Although the shocking costs can be attributed to healthcare systems used to treat the deadly disease, cancer also affects other areas of the economy including productivity lost through early death and time off work.

Britain spends £3.9billion on healthcare costs - visits to doctors, inpatient stays and medication - and £5.5billion due to productivity losses.

A further £1.9billion is due to informal care costs - the monetary value of leisure or work time friends and relatives give up to care for cancer patients. 

Breast cancer had the highest healthcare costs - £4.8billion each year - accounting for 13 per cent of the total cancer healthcare costs in the EU. 

However, the highest total economic burden was attributable to lung cancer - a total of £15billion - with £8billion due to premature mortality.

Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez, of Oxford University said: ‘One of the purposes of studies such as this one is to enable comparisons to be made between the burden of different diseases, aiding decision makers to prioritise scarce research funds.

‘In order to be in a better position to inform policy decisions there is a great need for improved information on epidemiology, healthcare resource use and unit costs across the EU.’

Professor Peter Boyle, President of the International Prevention Research Institute in Lyon, France, said: ‘It is essential that the economic impact of cancer on a community is known, understood and placed in its perspective. 

‘The greatest single economic cost was £4.8billion for breast cancer. This should be placed in the perspective that the economic cost of pneumonia in the EU is £8billion each year.

‘The cost of cancer is not just the cost of drugs and hospital stays and this has been taken into account by Dr Luengo-Fernandez.’

The lowest healthcare cost for cancer was £25 per year spent on healthcare for every person in Lithuania, while the highest was Germany at £131.

Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez said the study enables better informed policy decisions

Dr Luengo-Fernandez said: ‘The countries
 with the highest per-capita costs in terms of cancer healthcare tend to
 be Northern and Central European countries.

‘Those
 with the lowest per-capita costs tend to be member states who joined 
the EU in 2004 and have lower national income levels.’

Researchers from pharmaceutical company 
Bristol-Myers Squibb in the US, collected data from the 2010 and 2011 EU
 National Health and Wellness Surveys on 105,581 adults.

They found relatives who cared for 
cancer patients experienced worse physical and mental health, were more 
likely to be absent from work, were more impaired in their activities 
and had twice as many hospitalisations in six months than 
non-caregivers.

The report also found they were 50 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with depression and had double the odds of anxiety and insomnia, as well as higher odds of suffering from migraines, headaches or gastrointestinal problems.

Dr Isabelle Gilloteau - presenting 
the findings alongside Dr Luengo-Fernandez at the ESMO 2012 Congress of 
the European Society for Medical Oncology in Vienna - said: ‘This study 
underscores the importance of recognising caregiver burden, not just 
because of the direct implications for the well-being and quality of 
care of the patient with cancer, but also due to the extra burden it 
brings to society overall.’

Prof
 Boyle said: ‘The remarkable study of Dr Gilloteau and colleagues 
provides unique information on the impact of cancer on care-givers. This
 again is key information and is almost unique. 

‘These studies provide a background on which logical funding decisions can be made.’
