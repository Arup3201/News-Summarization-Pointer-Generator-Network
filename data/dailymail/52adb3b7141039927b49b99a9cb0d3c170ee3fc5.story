These jaw-dropping holiday snaps taken by a group of daredevil tourists in Norway may be some of the most dangerous ever taken.

The series of photos shows the friends taking turns as they stand on top of a boulder that is wedged between a mountain crevice in Norway, with a direct drop of nearly 800ft.

The incredible experience provides impressive views for those who are brave enough to step foot on the boulder, but those who are afraid of heights would become weak at the knees and think better of it.

Kjeragbolten – the official name for the boulder – is located on the edge of the Kjerag mountain in Rogaland, Norway.

It is situated more than 3,500ft above sea level and is a popular photo spot for thrill-seekers who are willing to risk their lives for a memorable holiday photo.

Despite the rain making its surface slippery the group of visitors in these photos ventured onto the boulder and posed with their arms in the air or a thumb extended as other tourists waited their turn.

He said: ‘During our visit if was a rainy, and the boulder was actually a bit slippery. There's a little path on the left side where you can jump onto the rock.

‘It's hard to describe the feeling of standing on the boulder. After walking up the mountains your legs are a bit tired, and the idea of jumping onto, and balancing on, a slippery boulder hanging above a fjord seems like a really bad idea.

‘But, to be honest, it's not hard getting out there, and it is well worth it.’

Mr Randen, dressed in blue, can be seen posing on the boulder with his hands in the air and in one photo, taken from a distance, shows the stunning view and terrifying drop.

Mr Randen, who lives just outside Oslo, said the hike up to Kjeragbolten is demanding as it involves three steep climbs.

He added: ‘Most of the time you walk on smooth rock and boulders and because it was rainy and foggy it was a bit slippery.

‘There are metal chains along the steepest climbs of the trail. When we finally arrived at the boulder it was rather foggy but after a while it started to clear up and we were rewarded with a stunning view of the Lysefjord.

‘The whole experience was so breathtaking and just looking at the images now really takes me back there.

‘It's not a place you go very often as it's a bit remote, but it's such an amazing piece of art from nature that it is definitely worth going.’
