A Dutch man who viewed graphic online photos and video of a suicide was shocked to learn that the footage was of his own father's death.

A group of teenage students were waiting on the platform of a train station in Driehuis, a city about 20 miles to the west of Amsterdam, when a man jumped in front of a train.

They then took photos and recorded video of the bloody aftermath and posted it on Twitter.

The footage then went viral and ended up being forwarded to a man who, quite randomly, was the son of the victim.

He did not realise at the time, however, that it was his father who had jumped.

It was not until a short while later when he was contacted by police that he realised the grisly footage he had seen was of his father killing himself.

Dutch police have now themselves taken to Twitter to ask users to remove any images of the suicide.

Officer Edwin Verweij, who had the job of telling the man that his father was dead, Tweeted: 'Had to tell relatives of the victim that their husband and father has been killed.

'Very emotional. Son saw pictures online before he knew it was his father! Very heavy so that's why the request [to delete the images].'
