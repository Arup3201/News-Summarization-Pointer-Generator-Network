A 66-year-old maths tutor was arrested on his doorstep in western Sydney and charged with sexually assaulting five of his young clients aged between 5 and 7 years old. 

Dramatic footage has been released by the police who unexpectedly knocked on the man's door in Greystanes on Tuesday morning before promptly handcuffing and locking him up in the back of a police van to be taken to Merrylands police station.

After the man answered the door and words were exchanged between him and the two officers he attempted to walk back inside the house when a male officer stopped him by grabbing his shoulder and putting on the handcuffs.
