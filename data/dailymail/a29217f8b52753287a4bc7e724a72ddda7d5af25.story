Prince Harry will leave the royal family's festivities so he can see in 2014 with his girlfriend Cressida Bonas.

The couple spent December 25 apart while the Prince celebrated Christmas with the Queen at Sandringham.

Cressida was staying with her father Jeffrey and stepmother Penelope just a few miles away from the royal estate in Norfolk.

But sources said the pair, who have been dating for around 19 months, will be reunited in time for the new year.

In the run up to Christmas, the prince and his girlfriend spent the weekend together at Sir Richard Branson's mansion in Kidlington, Oxfordshire.

They stayed as guests of the tycoon's son Sam, 28, and his wife Isabella Calthorpe, 33, who is Cressida's half-sister, the Daily Express reported.

Harry was seen with Sam Branson in The Bell pub at Hampton Poyle on Sunday before he later returned to the mansion nearby.

Sir Richard gave the mansion to his daughter Holly, 31, and son after deciding to spend most of his time on his Caribbean island of Necker.

After spending the new year with Cressida, Harry is hoping to spend a few days skiing early in 2014 before he has to return to duty as an Apache helicopter pilot.

Despite the couple spending so much time together, friends have moved to dismiss rumours that the couple are set to get engaged.

Cressida, 24, recently graduated from a dance course but is believed to be considering a career in teaching instead.

Meanwhile, well-placed sources close to the prince firmly scotched reports that Harry is holding a dinner party at Sandringham to which Cressida was invited.

'It's not true. Cressida isn't at, or going to Sandringham,' they said.

Another
 source added: 'That's not something that would happen when the Queen is
 in residence, as she will be until early February.'

On Christmas Eve, Harry went head-to-head with his brother Prince William in a charity friendly football match on the Sandringham Estate.

During the match between estate workers the Duke of Cambridge jokingly pleaded with the referee to give his brother a yellow card for 'backchat'.

The now traditional pre-Christmas fixture ended in a 2-2 draw.
