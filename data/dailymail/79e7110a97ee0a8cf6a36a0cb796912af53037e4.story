Fit for a prince: George is being treated to a themed birthday party to see in his first year

One might think a future monarch’s first birthday party would be a palatial affair with tiny party crowns, a miniature throne, perhaps even a few liveried footmen carrying in a towering cake to the sound of trumpets, as saluting soldiers march past the regal tot.

In truth, however, the Windsor tradition of first birthdays has always tended towards the simple.

The Royal Family take the view that, as tinies won’t remember the celebration, there’s little point in bothering.

The Queen’s parents were away on tour when she turned one.

The Duke of Edinburgh was on naval duty in Malta when Prince Charles woke up in Clarence House on his first birthday (though he did send a model plane).

Even Prince William was alone with his nanny, Barbara Barnes, because his parents were in Canada on his first birthday. They held a belated party at Buckingham Palace the next month.

Fortunately for peachy-cheeked Prince George, he can rely on the Middleton family, who make it their business — literally — to throw a good party.

Today, a full three days before his actual birthday, George was due to be taken by his parents to the Middletons’ home outside Bucklebury in Berkshire.

There, his doting grandmother Carole has arranged a Peter Rabbit-themed party that brands him a very middle-class little prince.

Although it is being described as a low-key ‘private family occasion’, much thought has gone into making it a perfect first birthday.

The presents — a football, wooden train, fleecy top and special photos and recordings — will not be lavish but have been chosen with love and care: there will be a special cake from his Spanish nanny, a piece of lace from his Italian housekeeper, a beautiful polo top and sun hat from Carole and his aunt Pippa.

Who better to be in charge than the Middletons, who have built an entire business empire on infant celebrations?

Their seven-bedroom Georgian pile, set in 18 acres, is the perfect venue, being spacious and familiar to George, who spent the first few weeks of his life there, being wheeled round the idyllic, rather Beatrix Potterish garden.

A cursory glance at the family website, Party Pieces, tells us that Carole, like Pippa, loves a themed event. ‘When she chooses a theme there’s no holding back,’ says a friend.

‘There will be pictures and posters everywhere, vol au vents in the shape of rabbits, fun trails, you name it. She always uses all her own stuff from Party Pieces and runs it like a military manoeuvre, while Michael hangs back somewhere, full of bonhomie.’

Business: Although the Royal Family tend towards muted affairs for infants' birthdays, Carole Middleton is a professional party-thrower, and her grandson's first birthday party will receive the full treatment

In choosing Peter Rabbit, Beatrix Potter’s delightfully naughty, greedy bunny who first appeared in 1902, Carole could not have picked a theme more wonderfully symbolic of middle-class values: Potter is the John Lewis of children’s authors — safe, enduring and moral.

Peter is her particularly beloved creation, the immature bunny who, like all small boys, wants to test the limits of his liberty: he disobeys and nearly ends up in a pie like his father, before running home to his mother.

The now defunct left-wing Inner London Education Authority banned him and his cousin Benjamin Bunny from London schools in the 1980s because it said the rabbits were too bourgeois.

Prince George’s bunny-themed bash is planned as an ‘extended family party’ to kick off his first birthday party week (on Tuesday, the day itself, he will probably have a second celebration organised by Kate at Kensington Palace).

'The place will be groaning with 1970s party food. Carole is a real feeder'

The Bucklebury affair will last no 
less than two hours but no more than three, so exhaustion and tears 
don’t set in. Besides the Middletons, godmother Zara, her husband Mike 
Tindall and their six-month-old daughter Mia Grace are on the guest 
list.

‘There will be lots of
 finger food, oodles of fresh fruit, organic ice creams and fresh fruit 
sorbets. He’ll have Peter Rabbit cake and home-made baby-bunny 
biscuits,’ says one close source.

The adults will have plenty to nibble, too. ‘Carole’s a real feeder,’ says another friend. ‘The place will be groaning with 1970s-style party food that the guests won’t be able to avoid eating.’

Prince George and friends will be seated, apparently, on bean bags printed with animal faces, one of which has ‘George’ embroidered on it. Kate, like Carole, loves anything personalised.

Pride of place will go to George’s ‘first birthday book’, which has been meticulously compiled by Kate, who used to take photographs for the Party Pieces website.

It contains snaps of George, often alongside his beloved companion, Lupo the black cocker spaniel; his crowd-pleasing trip to Australia and New Zealand; his first steps and many ‘fun snippets’. Kate and William have also made a CD of songs and lullabies which includes them singing ‘Happy First Birthday’.

The Cambridges are giving him a traditional wooden train with the carriages spelling out his name (presumably that’s the full George Alexander Louis).

Middleton classic: The family business is partial to a themed party, marketing these invitations for any other children wishing to follow suit with a Peter Rabbit themed party

He will also receive a personalised 
fleecy dressing-gown, and Prince William has had a hand-stitched 
football made for him (possibly in the colours of Aston Villa, the team 
William supports).

Lupo is ‘giving’ Prince George a paw-printed 
photograph of himself and George playing in the garden.

Although
 the firm instruction has been issued that George is not to be spoilt, a
 gratifying, good-natured rivalry has built up among the Windsors’ staff
 to see who can give George the most original, moving and comment-worthy
 present.

To this end, Kate and William’s housekeeper, Antonella Fresolene, is having a pillow made for him out of Tombolo lace, the product of an intricate 14th-century technique involving many bobbins worked around a round pillow.

The resulting lace is delicate, elaborate and very expensive. A piece of amber is also normally given on a first birthday in Italy, for the teething baby to suck.

Not to be outdone, nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo is making a traditional Tarta de Santiago, a dense cake from Santiago de Compostela in northwest Spain, which is made with almonds, eggs, sugar and grated orange zest.

It is supposed to bring good luck and usually has the Cross of Santiago (St James) on the top in dusted sugar.

From this we can assume that George is not one of that growing army of children with a nut allergy. He can also expect to have his earlobe pulled, a Spanish first birthday tradition to bring more good luck.

Carole and Pippa have been seen shopping in recent weeks in Blue Almonds, a fashionable London children’s shop, for new outfits including shorts, sun hats, swimming shorts and polo tops, so there may well be gifts of clothes as well as toys.

Uncle James is known for humorous 
presents: he once bought Carole some old plane seats ‘so she could 
practise her “doors to manual” ’.

British
 manufacturers of baby products will also be sending gifts. Johnstons of
 Elgin (Royal Warrant holders for Prince Charles), for instance, have 
made some cashmere cushions with ‘George’ knitted into them, in royal 
blue with cream lettering.

Beatrix Potter perfection: The winding gardens of the Middletons' Berkshire estate will be the ideal setting

Prince
 George even has his own commemorative birthday coin from the Royal 
Mint, a £5 (always the chosen amount for royal celebrations) coin in 
silver (the metal that must cross a baby’s palm to bring health and 
wealth). A limited edition of 7,500 are being made at £80 each.

Otherwise,
 the Georgian silver presents traditional on a first birthday — spoons, 
boxes, eggcups — will be the domain of wealthier godparents such as 
23-year-old Earl Grosvenor, heir to the Duke of Westminster, and 
long-time family friend William Van Cutsem. Both will see the Cambridges
 separately as neither is coming to the party.

Ten-month-old
 Henry Baker, son of godfather Oliver Baker (a contemporary of the 
couple at St Andrews University) and godson of Kate, might make it; 
alongside fellow godmother and interior designer Emilia 
Jardine-Paterson.

One friend says: ‘Wills and Kate want to keep Prince George’s first birthday as private and family-oriented as possible.

He can expect to have his earlobe pulled by nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo - a Spanish first birthday tradition to bring more good luck

If George wants to throw toys, have a 
teething fit, pull Lupo’s tail or be noisy, they want to be surrounded 
by family who will keep it all under wraps.

He
 is their only child and they want his first birthday to be memorable, 
fun and strictly unfussy. Whether the Peter Rabbit theme is considered 
middle-class will not trouble them one jot.

‘They
 are all unconcerned about the social nuances of a themed first birthday
 party for the heir to the throne. It will go swimmingly because that is
 what the Middletons are famous for doing. Attention to detail is their 
byword.’

One family friend says that, like most mothers of babies who get the opportunity, Kate hands George over to Carole the moment she gets to Bucklebury (the nanny doesn’t normally go with them, and will give her present to the prince at Kensington Palace), which suits everyone because Carole likes to be in control of her own domain just as much as Kate likes a rest.

Prince George’s first Bucklebury birthday party is a reminder that he is most certainly 50 per cent Middleton. And, given that the Windsor option wouldn’t have been nearly so much fun, he is all the better off for it.
