Scheming ‘heir-hunters’ who conned a dead woman’s unsuspecting relatives out of her almost £240,000 estate have been ordered to pay the victims back.

Beneficiaries Limited targeted three siblings after their 93-year-old aunt Charlotte Cook died in a rest home without leaving a will.

The company charged the bereaved family thousands of pounds in expenses before taking a massive cut of their £237,342 inheritance, a court heard yesterday.

Edinburgh-based Beneficiaries Limited billed more than £132,000 in commission and expenses

The siblings were left with little more than £10,000 each - money they still haven’t received.

Judge Richard Parkes branded the frauds ‘calculated, cynical and well planned’ and ordered the company to pay £200,000 compensation to the victims and fined it £25,000.

He said: ‘The relatives lost extremely substantial amounts of money in a very unfortunate and upsetting set of circumstances.’ 

The Edinburgh-based Beneficiaries Limited denied seven counts of fraud by false representation and three charges of misleading consumers by omission but a jury found them guilty on all 10 charges.

Following her death in January 2009 Mrs Cook’s financial guardian, solicitor Colin Bell, contacted Beneficiaries Limited to administer her will because she had no known family and no will.

During the trial last month the court heard that the business had racked up more than £15,000 in bills before they even contacted Mrs Cook’s family.

Gordon Menzies, prosecuting on behalf of West Berkshire Council, described how two people from Beneficiaries Limited - company director Alexander Pilley and a female colleague - visited siblings David Mitchell, Lesley Mitchell and Patricia Byrne at their homes in Surrey in October 2009.

He told the Reading Crown Court, Berkshire, that during meetings over two days the pair refused to tell the relatives who had died or how much the estate was worth.

Mr Menzies said the relatives were then given a contract to sign which stipulated Beneficiaries Limited would get a 40 per cent share of any inheritance payout and the family would cover the company’s expenses.

If they didn’t sign, the court was told, they would not get anything.

Beneficiaries Limited were not represented at the trial at Reading Crown Court and no one from the company attended

Mr Menzies said the company charged the siblings £3.33 per minute to meet with them over two days. Other expenses included £250 per person per night allowances for overnight stays.

The company’s commission and expenses amounted to over £132,000 including over £7,000 for the family visits.

Mr Menzies said, Beneficiaries Limited went on to sub-contract work to other firms which were also run by Pilley in a ‘highly artificial, very sophisticated and very cynical way of doing business’. 

The siblings should have got more than £35,000 each but were told they would receive little more than £10,700. 

A further two relatives in Canada should have received more than £50,000 each.

In total, the company should have paid out £213,096, but as yet they have not paid anything and the money appears to have disappeared.

The company was not represented at the trial and nobody from the firm attended.

The judge was told that it had no assets and was soon to be dissolved.

Pilley, of Livingston, West Lothian, was ruled to be unfit to stand trial last month.

A separate jury therefore went on to conclude in a trial of issue that Pilley had committed ‘the acts and omissions’ which comprised the offences.

Speaking outside of the hearing victim Lesley Mitchell explained how she had never met her aunt and that only of her cousins in Canada was aware of her.

The 59-year-old from Surrey said: ‘We couldn’t believe it when we learned we were due an inheritance. Sadly, I don’t think that we will ever see any of that money as it has all gone.’
