A school inspection was forced to be abandoned yesterday after angry parents confronted Ofsted staff over claims children as young as nine were asked about their attitude to homosexuality.

A review of the Olive Tree Primary School in Luton, a Muslim faith school, had to be halted after parents said they would withdraw their pupils from the school if the inspectors remained.

Parents were said to be concerned that the Ofsted staff were discussing sex with the children, without their consent.

A scheduled meeting between parents and inspectors saw the appropriateness of the questioning raised and after discussions the inspectors withdrew from the school a day early.

The chair of the school trust that runs the school, Farast Latif, said that the meeting between the parents and inspectors was largely amicable.

Ofsted inspectors left the school following the concern of parents

But added when the inspectors realised the parents were serious about pulling their children out of the school, they left. 

Mr Latif told the Guardian's Richard Adam: ‘One of the parents said to them, and all of us agreed, this is a safeguarding issue, we are not comfortable about adults speaking to our children about issues of sexuality.

‘When they realised we were serious about that, they left. This is about sexualising young children.’

The Olive Tree primary does not come under the Independent Schools Council and is therefore inspected by OFSTED.

Their standards require pupils are taught tolerance of different groups within society.

A spokesman for OFSTED confirmed that inspectors withdrew from the school but that sufficient evidence was gathered to complete the inspection.

They also added that inspectors were left to their own discretion when asking pupils questions about sexuality.

The news that inspectors withdrew from the school comes following reports a similar line of questioning was used on Muslim pupils into an investigation into schools in Birmingham over the alleged Trojan Horse plot.

However, an OFSTED spokesman added that questions about sexuality weren’t restricted to predominantly Muslim schools.

A spokesman told the newspaper: ‘As part of any school inspection, inspectors will ask pupils about the effectiveness of the school’s actions to prevent and tackle discriminatory and derogatory language.’

The Trojan Horse plot involves the alleged ousting of headteachers, mainly in and around the Birmingham area, by Islamic extremists attempting to take over several top schools in a bid to target vulnerable young people.

Whistleblowers at Park View School in the city have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body.
