Dane Thomas Bjorn hopes to seal his Ryder Cup place on home soil this week at a course where he had his first win as a professional in 1995.

The 43-year-old has filled an automatic spot since December and only three qualifying events remain, including this week’s Made In Denmark tournament in Himmerland.

Bjorn missed the cut after consecutive rounds of 75 at the US PGA Championship last week, but still sits seventh on the points list. 

Final push: Bjorn has been in the qualification spots all season and can seal his place this week

Stephen Gallacher and Francesco Molinari will also look to boost their hopes in the Wyndham Championship in North Carolina. 

Gallacher is fewer than 13 points behind Graeme McDowell, who occupies the final automatic place. Molinari is more than 30 points adrift.

At the back: Graeme McDowell is currently in the last spot and under threat
