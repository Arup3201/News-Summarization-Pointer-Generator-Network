A man who was mauled by a family of bears is lucky to be alive after he was attacked while hunting on a remote island off the coast of Alaska.

Michael Snowden, 68, had to be transported by coast guards to Kodiak hospital to be treated  for serious leg injuries after his annual hunting trip in the Alaskan wilderness took an horrific turn

'You could feel it puncture deeply and you could feel the teeth,' he told ABC News.  

The experienced hunter suddenly became the mighty beasts' prey when out of nowhere a 700 pound bear pounced upon him.

Bitten: Out of nowhere at 700 pound bear pounced on Snowden. "You could feel it puncture deeply and you could feel the teeth' he said

 'I could see him just shaking his head with his teeth buried in my leg. I was being tossed about like a rag doll.' 

A group of up to five bears attacked Mr Snowden and his son-in-law Jeff Ostrin as they dragged the carcass of a deer they had shot through dense vegetation on Sally Island in Uganik Bay.

The animal attacked Mr Snowden, biting and scratching his body before Mr Ostrin jumped into action, firing three shots at the bear and killing it to save his father-in law.

'i was terrified for Mike, I was terrified for myself,' he said. 

Hero: Jeff Ostrin jumped into action firing three shots at the bear and killing it to save his father-in law

Gratitude: 'If it hadn't have been for my son-in-law i doubt i would have survived this attack', Mr Snowden said

The deer hunter: The blood that was coming from the deeer carcas they were dragging through the woods is likely to blame for their grisley encouvnter

Within moments, as another grisly made a run for them, Mr Ostrin reloaded his rifle and his courage.

'I had to protect both of us for either of us to have a chance make it out of there.'

But it wasn't over yet - a third bear came on scene and the pair had to scream at it, in order to make it run away.

Mr Snowden suffered deep gashes to his thigh and needed 100 staples to close the wounds, but he is expected to make a full recovery.

'If it hadn't have been for my son-in-law I doubt I would have survived this attack', Mr Snowden said.

The blood that was coming from the deer carcass they were dragging through the woods is likely to blame for their grisly encounter

The attack took place last week on a remote island off the southern coast of mainland Alaska. 

The state is home to 98 per cent of the United States' total brown bear population. 

Mr Snowden and his son-in-law were dragging a deer through vegetation when they stopped for lunch. 

No sooner had they sat down to eat when a large female bear charged at them. 

Seconds later, more bears emerged, with Ostrin shooting and killing one of the cubs. The shooting scared the rest of the animals away.

A crew on board a fishing vessel witnessed the entire incident and reportedly raced to the shore to remove the men to the safety of the sea, with the captain calling the coast guard to the scene.

Mr Snowden was first transported by helicopter to Kodiak Municipal Airport, before being taken to the Providence Kodiak Island Medical Center where he was treated for his leg wounds. 

'The fact that there were five bears was an abnormality and this serves as a reminder that anything can happen and we need to be aware of our surroundings,' said Lt. Joseph Schlosser, operational unit watchstander for the Coast Guard 17th District.

Hunters in rural Alaska are told not to carry the entire carcasses of animals they have killed because bears are attracted by the smell of blood.

Instead, hunters are advised to carefully butcher the animals where they died and place the meat into sealed containers.
