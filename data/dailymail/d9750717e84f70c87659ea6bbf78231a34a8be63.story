Valencia left-back Aly Cissokho is having a medical at Aston Villa's Bodymoor Heath training complex ahead of a move.

The French international, 26, who played 19 games on loan at Liverpool last season, would cost around £2million and likely likely push Joe Bennett down the pecking order.

Paul Lambert has been looking to strengthen that area of his team after Ryan Bertrand's loan move came to an end. 

Transfer: Valencia signed Cissokho from Lyon for £5m two years ago, but would accept less than half that now

The Villa manager plans to use Kieran Richardson further up the pitch.

Cissokho, who has one cap for France, moved to Valencia from Lyon two years ago for around £5m. 

He still has two years left on his contract.

He would become Lambert's fourth signing of the summer, after Joe Cole, Philippe Senderos and Richardson, as the Scot looks to add experience to his squad. Senderos spent the second half of last season on loan at Valencia.
