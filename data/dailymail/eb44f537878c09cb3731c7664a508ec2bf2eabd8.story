The mother of Australia's most senior Islamic State militant Mohammad Ali Baryalei believes he is still alive, despite reports he was killed in Syria last month.

Homira Baryalei said she had not heard from her son recently, but she still held hope that he was not one of a number of Australian Islamic fighters believed to have been killed in coalition airstrikes in Kobane.

'I don't know anything. I do not have any news about him. I believe he's alive,' Ms Baryalei told The Australian. 

Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East, is also named as a co-conspirator in a terrorism plot allegedly planned by Sydney man, Omarjan Azari.

Mohammad Ali Baryalei has been killed in the Middle East, according to a friend

A friend visits the home of Mohammad Ali Baryalei's mother, Homira, in western Sydney on Wednesday evening

Former Sydney nightclub bouncer Baryalei and Azari, who are both Afghani Australians, are named in Commonwealth terrorism charges laid after Azari, 22, was arrested on September 18 during a series of raids by counter terrorist police.

According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days before the raids between Azari and Baryalei. Court papers allege Azari ‘did conspire with Mohammad Baryalei and others to do acts in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act’ between May and September this year.

Azari’s legal team says there was only one phone call allegedly from Baryalei in September, made around seven weeks before reports emerged of Baryalei’s death in Syria.

Before working as a Kings Cross bouncer and then becoming a radicalised Muslim, Baryalei reportedly attended two Catholic schools in Sydney’s west.  

Baryalei recruited as many as half of the Australian militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in the Middle East

One source told ABC about Baryalei's love for gambling, women, drugs and painted him as someone who mixed with questionable characters. 

'He gambled a lot ... He once won $8,000 or $9,000 on the pokies, then played it back down ... and he loved cocaine.,' the source told the 7.30 program.

The friend also said they thought Baryalei, originally from Sydney, may have gotten 'in too deep' in the scene, and it seemed as though he saw more than he could handle.

The wanted terrorist is also said to have battled with mental illness growing up, suffering extensive bouts of depression which saw him confined to his room for days on end.

A neighbour of the man seemed to echo these sentiments when speaking to The Sydney Morning Herald, telling of the man's troubles growing up. 

Neighbours said Baryalei's mother believed him to be overseas studying to be a cleric

In his prior life, Baryalei (left and right) was an aspiring actor who played a bit part role in Underbelly (right)

He apparently suffered a traumatic childhood at the hands of his abusive father, and left home at just 17.

Despite this Baryalei would still help out around the neighbourhood, doing 'odd jobs' for those who needed the help.

'He was a clean cut young man. Somebody must have gotten inside his head,' a source told the website. 

Meantime the Federal government is still trying to confirm reports that Baryalei - the most senior Australian militant in the Islamic State terror group - has in fact been killed. 

Abdullah Elmir, the 17-year-old who fled Sydney to fight for the Islamic State, is believed to have been recruited by Baryalei

Omarjan Azari, 22, was arrested and charged in the nation's largest ever terror raids last month. Prosecutors allege Baryalei conspired with him in a beheading plot

'We are currently seeking to confirm whether the 16th Australian foreign fighter has indeed been killed in this conflict,' Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told parliament last month.

As news filtered through of Baryalei's apparent demise, the neighbours of his parents in Sydney's northwest spoke about his mother's pain over her son's decision to join the radical group.

The neighbour said Ms Baryalei had been devastated by her son's decision to take up arms with IS.

'She was crying. She couldn't believe it was her son,' she said.

'All she knew was he was overseas studying to be a cleric and would call her every so often.

'He was very protective of his mum.'
