Shayanna Jenkins, girlfriend of former New England Patriot and accused killer Aaron Hernandez, may have helped him dispose of the weapon that allegedly killed Odin Lloyd, newly unsealed search warrants reveal.

Two recently revealed warrants authorized a search of a Bristol, Connecticut storage facility where investigators believe that Jenkins may have disposed of the gun the day after the murder occurred.

Authorities connected Jenkins to the weapon with surveillance video footage that shows her carrying a lock box in which the gun may have been stored out of Hernandez's home.

According to The Sun Chronicle police are now looking to Jenkins as an accomplice for possibly disposing of the alleged murder weapon.
