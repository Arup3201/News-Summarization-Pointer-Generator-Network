The plugin, from San Francisco-based firm Streak, lets senders see when their emails have been opened and the reader's location, pictured

If 'read receipts' on emails weren't annoying enough, a San Francisco-based firm has taken the art of tracking emails to the next level.

The Streak plugin lets Gmail account holders monitor which of their sent items have been opened, who opened them, the exact time they were opened and how many times those emails have been viewed since.

It also reveals details about the device used to read the email, and even the reader's approximate location.

Streak is aimed at sales and marketing professionals, and the company calls it a 'Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) in your inbox.'

However, the plugin can be installed by anyone using Gmail on Google Chrome and Safari.

Aside from tracking emails, the plugin can also track stories and keywords, and keep track of bookings made as
 part of a wedding or other event.

Once installed, users can set Streak's Email Tracking function to be enabled by default and each time they send an email, Streak will automatically track it.

The feature can also be disabled at any time.

When an email is read, a popup notification appears in the corner of the sender's inbox to tell them which email has been read, by whom, and on what device.

An eye icon on the right-hand side of the email in the inbox will also turn green and hovering over it will reveal how many times the email has been read.

Clicking this icon then opens a sidebar, and under 'more details', senders can see the exact time it was opened and the location plotted on an interactive Google map.

At no point is the reader of the email informed that they have been tracked.

Streak doesn’t explain exactly how it is able to track a reader’s location and device details and has not yet responded to a request for comment.

However, similar services work by attaching images to emails that are stored on an external server.

When an email is opened, a request is made to the server to download the image and in the process of this request, the IP address is revealed. This address can then be used to locate the user.

In tests carried out by MailOnline, the service was not able to pinpoint a precise location, but it was able to identify the general area within London.

Meanwhile, tests carried out by PJ Vogt from OnTheMedia located the reader of his email to within about five minutes of their exact location in New York. 

Vogt advises that to avoid being tracked, users would need to stop images being automatically loaded in an email client. He also claims different clients offer different levels of protection.

Streak only lets users track 200 emails a month for free before charging a premium for extra emails.

There is also an iOS app that performs a similar task, built by a separate company.

Called Mailtracker, the app lets people know when their email is being read. It also tells users details such as what platform their email was read on, how long it was read, and from what city.
