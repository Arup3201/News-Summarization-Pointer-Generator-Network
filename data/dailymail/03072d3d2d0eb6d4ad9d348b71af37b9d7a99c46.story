National Grid was branded  hypocritical today for leaving the lights on at its near-empty headquarters overnight - 24 hours after it warned Britain it faced a power crisis.

On Tuesday its bosses said capacity to supply electricity this winter is at its lowest since 2007, which means there could be  a series of 'brownouts' this winter that could dim the lights in millions of homes.

But the message has not got through to management who left their vast estate in Warwickshire 'lit up like a Christmas tree' after dark.

It came as its experts admitted Britain faces its greatest risk of power shortages in eight years following the closure of coal-fired power stations to meet EU carbon reduction targets.

Lights are on but nobody's home: National Grid's headquarters brightens the night sky 24 hours after it warned of an upcoming power shortage

Mixed messages: The empty desks belong to the workforce remain lit up despite being outside normal office hours  

Clocked off: The near-empty car park with the bright headquarters in the background has been branded hypocritical today

James Robinson, 42, who works nearby, said: 'It's ridiculous that this huge building is lit up like a Christmas tree.

'When we leave our office we make sure the lights are switched off but these people should definitely know better.

'It's a real kick in the teeth for hard-working members of the British public when they announce that we might have our lights dimmed this winter while they are leaving theirs on at night.

'It reeks of hypocrisy - it's just not on.'

The  photos were taken at 7.30pm on yesterday and show bright lights coming from every window of National Grid House in Warwickshire.

An empty boardroom with some lights left on is also visible and other images show vast car parks with barely any vehicles left in them lit up by a series of street lamps.

A National Grid spokesman said: 'National Grid is responsible for making sure the country has a reliable energy supply at all times. To do this, staff work on a number of shift patterns meaning National Grid House is in use 24 hours a day, seven days week. The building itself has many energy conserving measures including sensor controlled lighting which turns itself off automatically if a room is empty'. 

Their is a stark contrast to the gloomy message put out by the National Grid on Tuesday.

Wasteful: The photos were taken at 7.30pm on yesterday and show bright lights coming from every window of National Grid House in Warwickshire

Contrast: Nationally National Grid is taking emergency measures, including paying large factories to turn off their machines during peak periods this winter, in order to keep the lights on across Britain

Empty: One of the vast site's kitchens and a nearby meeting room remained well lit after office hours last night 

Defence: National Grid says it runs a 24 hour operation from the headquarters and the buildings have light-saving features

It is taking emergency measures, including paying large factories to turn off their machines during peak periods this winter, in order to keep the lights on.

Separately, it plans to pay energy firms millions of pounds to switch on three back-up power stations to cope with high demand if there is a big freeze.

Despite this, the National Grid warns it may be necessary to turn down the voltage in the cables to conserve supplies during some periods, which would lead to brownouts.

Energy experts say this would not only dim the lights but could also interfere with electronic equipment, computers and electric clocks.

The gap between the electricity the nation's power stations and wind farms can produce and demand in an average winter will be 4.1per cent, which is the lowest level in eight years.

However, this safety margin would be wiped out for some periods in December and January if the UK suffers the sort of cold winter that is seen once every 20 years.

Major energy users say the situation provides damning evidence that the race to close coal fired power stations and switch to wind farms has failed to deliver a reliable power supply.

Dr Adam Marshall, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'The prospect of energy shortages and rolling blackouts – for factories - is simply unacceptable, as they may cause major disruption for British businesses'.

National Grid and politicians insist there is no chance of homes completely losing power - with Energy Secretary Ed Davey saying: 'There will be no blackouts. Period.'
