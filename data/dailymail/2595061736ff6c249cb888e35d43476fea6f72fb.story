Athletes rely on their toned physiques to excel and in the fifth annual ESPN Magazine's The Body Issue 20 sports stars have stripped down to celebrate those God-given talents.

In the much-celebrated issue, which hits newsstands on July 12, gorgeous blond NHRA funny car racer Courtney Force and Denver Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried each grace one of eight covers, while New York Mets pitcher Matt Harvey 
also shows off his fine form.

Laying provocatively on a huge car tire in the desert, 25-year-old Force is certainly a force to be reckoned with. In another shot, the driver is pictured nude carrying a red gas can down the middle of an empty road.

She told The New York Daily News that she had to train extra hard to keep up with her male counterparts on the track. 'We're driving 10,000 horsepower cars and although I am a female, I have to work extra hard to drive one of these cars to keep up with the men.'

Harvey 
poses with nothing but his mitt and a baseball in the magazine and a second image shows his sneaking out of a hotel room, naked, with dirty dishes covering his modesty.

The right-hander is used 
to being in the limelight for his feats on the field, but stripping off 
for the American public in 'The Body Issue' was another ball game.

'It
 was kind of nerve-racking at first,' Harvey told The Daily News. 'I've 
never been fully nude in front of random people like that before - 
especially with a camera around. But now that it is all done, it was a 
fun experience.'

Other
 stars featured this year included Miesha Tate, the 26-year-old No. 1 
bantamweight contender on the women's Ultimate Fighting Championship 
circuit, posing in nothing but a pair of pink boxing gloves on the beach
 and professional snowboarder Elena Hight, who goes bare down a mountain
 with just her board.

Basketball player Faried also snagged a cover this year and the 
23-year-old, nicknamed the 'Manimal,' shows off his impeccably toned 
physique again in the spread with his weapon of choice - a basketball - 
in his grip.
