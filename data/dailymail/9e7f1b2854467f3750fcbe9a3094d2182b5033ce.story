Former Vice President Dick Cheney's wife Lynne has theorized that Monica Lewinsky has come out with her story this early in the 2016 presidential calendar so that Hillary Clinton won't have to deal with it when she announces her presumed candidacy.

'I really wonder if this isn’t an effort on the Clintons' part to get that story out of the way,' Lynne Cheney said during a Tuesday night interview on Fox News.

'Would Vanity Fair publish anything of Monica Lewinsky that Hillary Clinton wouldn’t want in Vanity Fair?'

Question of timing: Former Second Lady Lynne Cheney believes that Monica Lewinsky's essay was released now in order to make it 'old news' by the time Hillary Clinton is formally running for president

Her remarks came hours after the magazine released a preview of an upcoming tell-all essay and adjoining collection of photos that the former President's mistress released, breaking her more than decade-long silence on their White House affair.

Hillary Clinton has not formally launched
 her campaign but she is widely assumed to be the Democratic frontrunner
 for the presidency and has been taking part in a speaking tour while 
finishing her latest book- both of which serve as signs towards an 
expected run.

According to Mrs Cheney, who is also promoting her own book, this latest possible hiccup into the scandal seems perfectly timed before it could really inflict too much harm.

'Getting it out of the way so we can say one more time it's old news seems to be like a strategy or a tactic, perhaps,' Mrs Cheney said.

Mrs Cheney posed her theory during an 
appearance on The O'Reilly Factor, which was being hosted by substitute 
Laura Ingraham on Tuesday night.

Part of the plan: Cheney argues that what may seem like a problem for Clinton now- the essay- is a way of addressing the cheating scandal in the easiest way possible

Ms
 Ingraham loved the theory- saying that she was 'really mad I didn't 
think of it first'- but other Republicans are wary of wading too deep 
into the Monica-gate issue like they first did during the impeachment 
hearings in 1998.

The initial scandal coincided with the
 midterm elections, and while the GOP focused on their liberal 
opponent's moral misgivings, they didn't end up winning back the House.

'This is the same trick the Clintons pulled on us back in ‘98,' conservative strategist Grover Norquist told Buzzfeed.

'We
 didn’t campaign against the massive overspending, or anything else. We 
were distracted by this bright, shiny object they handed out which was 
Monica Lewinsky.

'It will be
 the same thing this time: "Pay no attention to the reset of foreign 
policy with Russia, or Libya. Oh look, it’s Hillary the victim!"'

'It’s a constant challenge, but it’s like in baseball: if they throw out a bad pitch and you swing at it, then you’re an idiot.'

One Republican who initiated the 'Monicagate' talk even before the Vanity Fair article
 was announced was Senator Rand Paul, who called the former President a 
'sexual predator' earlier this year and brought up the affair in the 
context of the Democrats' claims that Republican's launched a 'war on 
women'.

Focus on the past: Republican strategists have cautioned politicians from making too much of the 1998 scandal between then-President Clinton and his former intern because it will not help them at the polls

The full version of Monica Lewinsky's tell-all essay has been released and she accurately predicted how conservative political pundits would read into the timing of her re-emergence. 

'Despite what some headlines will 
falsely report about this piece, this is not about Me versus the 
Clintons. Their lives have moved on; they occupy important and powerful 
places on the global stage. I wish them no ill will,' she writes in the 
latest issue of Vanity Fair.

'When
 I hear of Hillary's prospective candidacy, I cannot help but fear the 
next wave of paparazzi, the next wave of 'Where is she now?' stories, 
the next reference to me in Fox News's coverage of the primaries. I've 
begun to find it debilitating to plot out the cycle of my life, to some 
degree, on the political calendar.'

As
 a counter point to the point she expected conservatives- like Mrs 
Cheney- would make, Lewinsky described her decision to write the essay 
as a matter of her no longer wanting to put her life on hold.

'Being a conscientious Democrat- and 
aware that I could be used as a tool for the left or the right- I have 
remained silent for 10 years,' she writes in the Vanity Fair article.

She
 also notes that the scandal and her ensuing notoriety has had clear 
repercussions in her personal life, as her friends have gone off to get 
married and have children, while she regularly gets rejected from job 
opportunities and decided to flee to England to get her master's in 
social psychology at the London School of Economics.

Lewinsky
 explained that she took great care to cause as few problems for Mrs 
Clinton as possible when she first ran for president in 2008, but has 
had a change of heart when it comes to this next, expected run.

'I remained virtually reclusive, despite being inundated with press requests,' she said of the 2008 campaign.

Coming back out: Monica Lewinsky accurately predicted that her decision to speak out would be interpreted as having a role in the 2016 presidential primaries (pictured in London in 2013)

'I put off announcing several media projects in 2012 until after the election. (They were subsequently canceled—and, no, I wasn’t offered $12million for a salacious tell-all book, contrary to press reports.)

'And recently I’ve found myself gun-shy yet again, fearful of ‘becoming an issue’ should she decide to ramp up her campaign. But should I put my life on hold for another 8 to 10 years?'

She revealed that the decade-long silence has come at a cost, as she turned down offers that would've amounted to $10million because she 'didn't feel like the right thing to do'.

'It’s time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress,' she said, poking fun at the infamous '90s attire that she is so closely associated with.

'Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any ‘abuse’ came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position,' she wrote in the essay.

'The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power.'

Linda Tripp secretly recorded her colleague, Monica Lewinsky, when she revealed her affair with the President

Linda Tripp: Tripp
 worked at the Pentagon and became close with Lewinsky after the then 
23-year-old intern was transferred from the White House in 1996. 
Lewinsky revealed the sexual affair with Clinton and, on the advice of 
Goldberg, Tripp began recording their conversations. She turned those 
more than 20 hours of tapes over to Kenneth Starr in exchange for 
immunity. She was also the one to convince Lewinsky not to have a blue 
dress dry cleaned because it had the President's semen stain on it, 
arguing that it was the young intern's 'ultimate protection' if 
prosecutors would come after her. Tripp was later charged with illegally
 recording Lewinsky but those charges were dripped. She was fired from 
her Pentagon job on the last day of the Clinton administration in 2001 
and received a $595,000 payout from the government because she 
successfully argued that she was not granted a promotion due to her 
involvement in the scandal and other related charges. Her most recent 
update came in 2003 during an appearance on Larry King's talk show where
 she revealed she had breast cancer. She is last believed to have moved 
to Virginia with her German architect husband.

Lucianne Goldberg:

Lucianne Golbderg convinced Tripp to record the Lewinsky conversations

The book publisher played a 
pivotal role in the Lewinsky scandal by becoming close with Linda Tripp 
and advising her to tape her conversations with Lewinsky. Goldberg was 
the one who told Tripp that Maryland- where she was based- had one-party
 consent laws which would make it legal for Tripp to record Lewinsky 
without her knowledge. (That was not actually the case.) she also urged 
Tripp to both hand over the tapes to Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr 
and to Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff. Aftr the scandal died down, 
she began writing for right-leaning websites and hosting her own radio 
show though that is no longer nationally syndicated.

Kenneth Starr:

Kenneth Starr was the independent counsel who led the investigation

Appointed as the Independent 
Counsel at the start of the Clinton administration in 1994, Starr had a 
leading role in the investigations of a number of scandals but the 
Lewinsky affair was by far the most infamous. Paula Jones, a former 
employee from Arkansas, was suing the President over an alleged sexual 
assault when he asked Clinton about his relationship with Lewinsky for 
the first time. In that deposition, Clinton denied having 'sexual 
relations' with the intern, and Starr then used the semen-stained dress 
and hours of surreptitiously obtained Starr recordings to charge the 
President with perjury. Starr gained worldwide recognition for his role 
in the scandal and shared the Time ‘Man of the Year’ title with Clinton 
in 1998. He resigned as independent counsel the next year and went into 
academics, first teaching law at NYU and George Mason before being named
 the dean of the law school at Pepperdine University in 2004. He went on
 to continue work as a lawyer and notably represented Clinton fundraiser
 Jeffrey Epstein in his 2007 statutory rape case. He was named the 
president of Baylor University in 2010 and continues to hold that 
position.
