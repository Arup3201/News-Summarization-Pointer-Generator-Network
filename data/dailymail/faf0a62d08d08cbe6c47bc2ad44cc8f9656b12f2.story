More than 2,100 patients have died from conditions related to hunger and thirst in hospitals and care homes in the last decade, figures reveal.

Last year there were 186 deaths – almost four a week – many involving elderly people too frail or confused to feed themselves.

The Department of Health admitted it is ‘utterly scandalous’ and pledged to bring in inspections to ensure patients are fed.

More than 2,100 patients died from conditions related to hunger and thirst in hospitals and care homes in past decade

Figures from the Office for National 
Statistics show that since 2003 there have been 1,323 deaths in 
hospitals where dehydration was the underlying cause, and a further 273 
in care homes.

Over the same period 499 hospital patients and 67 care home residents died from conditions linked to malnutrition.

There
were many more cases in which patients were severely dehydrated or 
malnourished when they died, but it was not the underlying cause of 
their death.

Officials said that illnesses such as dementia make patients prone to dehydration and malnutrition.

Nonetheless
Norman Lamb, the minister for care, said: ‘Failings of care that may 
contribute to people being malnourished or dehydrated are entirely 
unacceptable.

'The law requires that care homes must ensure residents 
receive enough to eat and drink and we expect the Care Quality 
Commission to take swift action when this is not the case.’

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Every NHS patient should expect to be looked after properly in hospital.

‘It is utterly scandalous if patients go hungry or thirsty.’

The spokesman said the CQC will bring in nutrition inspections with fines for the worst hospitals.

Norman Lamb said the failings of care were 'utterly unacceptable'

The
figures show there have been 61,355 deaths tied to falls in hospitals 
and care homes since 2003. There were 18,499 deaths from superbug C 
Difficile and 2,649 from MRSA.

Last month a report by the CQC watchdog revealed that one in ten inspections of hospitals and care homes found neglect.

Inspectors came across some care homes where nurses failed to check if patients needed help with food or had lost weight.

In one home in East London they came across five bedbound patients left in their rooms with no drinking water.

Liz
Kendall MP, Labour’s spokesman for care and older people, said: ‘Every 
elderly person deserves the high standards of care that we’d all want 
for our own mum or dad.

‘It is unacceptable for anyone to be denied dignified and compassionate support at a time when they need it the most.

‘But
we will never get the care we aspire to from a social care system that 
has been stretched to the limit and cut to the bone.’
