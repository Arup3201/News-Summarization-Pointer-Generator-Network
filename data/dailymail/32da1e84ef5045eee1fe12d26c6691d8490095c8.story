The teenage girl had almost completely forgotten about dropping a message in a bottle into the Pacific Ocean as a schoolchild in Japan five years ago.

But Saki Arikawa, 17, of Kagoshima, Japan, got a huge surprise after a sailor found it more than 4,000 miles away after it washed up on a beach at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii.

The girl said on Sunday she is hugely grateful to U.S. Navy Petty Officer Jon Moore, who stumbled upon the clear glass bottle on Thursday, as he has helped her reconnect with her old classmates.

‘It's a miracle,’ Saki said from Kagoshima. ‘It's incredible.’

The bottle contained four origami cranes - symbols of peace in Japan - as well as a photo of Saki’s elementary school class.

It also had a note dated March 25, 2006, and signed by Saki saying she wanted it to be ‘a graduation memory’.

News of the bottle reconnected more than a dozen of her old classmates, now studying at different high schools, for a reunion on Saturday.

Their elementary school homeroom teacher also attended. Saki says she now wants to further expand the circle of friendship.

‘Thanks to the bottle, some of us could get together and had a great time,’ she said. ‘Now I'd like to meet the person who kindly saved my bottle.’

The bottle was one of five she tossed into the ocean in 2006 as her sixth-grade class graduated from Kokubu Elementary School in Kagoshima.

She and her 31 classmates dropped five bottles each, including the one that turned up last week.

Three other bottles had previously been recovered - including two in Alaska and a third at another location in Hawaii.

Akira Nakashima, the principal of Kokubu Elementary School in Kagoshima, confirmed that Saki graduated from the school five years ago.

'It's just amazing that the bottle was found. I'm so delighted by the heart-warming news,' Mr Nakashima said earlier this week.

Petty Officer Moore was among 40 base personnel and 16 students and faculty from a local school who picked up beach rubbish to mark International Coastal Cleanup Day.
