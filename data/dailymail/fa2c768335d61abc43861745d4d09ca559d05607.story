Battlefield 3 has been the hit shoot 'em up of 2011 - selling eight million copies with its hyper-realistic depictions of modern urban warfare.

But its depictions of assaults with American armoured vehicles have not been a hit everywhere.

In Tehran, the game has been banned as 'propaganda', according to reports in an Iranian computer magazine - and young Iranians are also protesting against it online.

The game depicts US Marines with authentic weaponry fighting in Middle Eastern countries - but the level in Tehran's Grand Bazaar has caused fury

The 'Grand Bazaar' level that has caused controversy: The bazaar is a historical market in the centre of the country's capital

The 'ban' - enforced by reported raids on computer shops - is due largely to a level called 'Grand Bazaar', which is set in a clearly recognisable area of the Iranian capital.

The game's release comes at a time when tensions between the two countries are high - and Iranians are angry that one of the world's largest game companies would use real-world locations.

Rival Modern Warfare 3 is careful to have villains who are rogue Russian extremists - after earlier versions set in Middle Eastern countries.

The Asr-e Ertebat publication reported a security source as saying, 'All computer stores are prohibited from selling this illegal game.'

The (real) Grand Bazaar in Tehran: The bazaar is a historical landmark still in use as a market today

The game uses real American vehicles and weaponry - and the scenario sails a little too close to political reality for both the regime and young Iranians

An online petition has also drawn a reported 5,000 signatures, saying, 'We understand that the story of a videogame is hypothetical but we 
believe the game is purposely released at a time when the US is pushing 
the international community into fearing Iran.'

There have also been unconfirmed reports that shops selling the game have been raided.

The ban is unlikely to bother makers Electronic Arts unduly - the game has not been officially released in the territory, and thus all copies sold are liable to be pirated.

The game - often played online in teams - features squads of US Marines fighting in cities including Paris as well as Tehran.

The 'Grand Bazaar' level is the one that has caused controversy, though - with US forces fighting hostile militia in a clearly recognisable Tehran, including the city's Grand Bazaar.

American games set in the Middle East and beyond are nothing new, of course - many titles have been set in Afghanistan or unnamed Far Eastern countries.

The US military also releases its own videogame - America's Army - which is designed as both a recruiting tool and a training tool for soldiers.

The game is available free online, and again features Middle Eastern locations as some of its battlegrounds.
