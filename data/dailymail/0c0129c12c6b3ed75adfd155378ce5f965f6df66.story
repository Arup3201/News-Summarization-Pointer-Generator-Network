Admit it girls - just because you've grown up, it doesn't mean your girlish dreams have faded.

I may be a 20-something woman with my own home and career, but in my head I'm still a Disney princess, convinced that a handsome prince is waiting to whisk me away to his castle, where we'll live happily ever after…

So this week I treated myself to a really girly beauty moment – I enlisted the help of pro make-up artist Olivia Newman-Young to create a fun, colourful look inspired by Princess Elsa in the huge Disney movie Frozen.

This week Binky relives her childhood fantasies as she is made over to look like Queen Elsa from Frozen 

Step 1: Shimmering Skin

'Binky's complexion is naturally quite tanned,' says Olivia. 'So to give her Elsa's icy skin I smoothed on Givenchy Teint Couture Long-Wearing Fluid Foundation in a paler shade than she'd usually use – it's a gorgeous base that leaves your face looking flawlessly smooth and dewy. 

'Fix in place with a dusting of loose powder – I swirled on bareMinerals Illuminating Veil, using a big, soft brush.'

Step 2: Disney Eyes 

Binky was joined by ex-MIC star Olivia Newman-Young to recreate the girly make-up 

'All cartoon characters have huge, wide eyes – which makes Binky the perfect model for our princess,' explains Olivia. 

'Defining her brows with Clarins Pro Palette Eyebrow Kit adds emphasis to Binky's big, brown eyes.

'Next, I recreated Elsa's shimmery pink eye make-up, first smoothing a baby pink shade from Dior's 5 Couleurs Eyeshadow Palette in Tutu across her lids and up to her brow bone. 

'I then added a pop of colour using Clarins Ombre Minerale Single Eyeshadow in Vibrant Violet to the centre of her lids, merging it into the pale pink.

Olivia recreated the wide Disney eyes with a dot of white eyeliner in the corners to make them appear larger

'A dot of bright white eyeshadow in the inner corners of the eyes is a clever make-up artist's trick for opening up the eyes to achieve that wide-eyed cartoon look.

'I completed the Elsa effect with strong black eyeliner along the upper lash line around the outer corner of the lower lash line, using Daniel Sandler Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet. Finally, I added lashings of Double Perfection Mascara by the brilliant Japanese brand DHC. It lengthens and thickens lashes amazingly well, without clumping or flaking.'

Step 3: Winter Glow

To complete the 'Elsa effect' Olivia used thick black eyeliner to make Binky's eyes pop

'To give Binky the cartoonish effect of ultra-high cheekbones and apple cheeks I used Too Faced Sweethearts Blush in Candy Glow. This shimmery pink powder comes in a wonderful heart-shaped box – just the thing for our girlishly romantic look – and its glistening sheen adds a gorgeous radiance to Binky's skin,' explained Olivia. 

'Finally, a slick of tinted lipgloss in a warm berry shade really pulls together all the pinks in this look. I used Clarins Gloss Prodige Lipgloss in Raspberry.'

Thanks Olivia – you've made me look as pretty as a princess. Now to find my knight in shining armour! All the products Olivia used are available at Escentual.com, and you can check out more beauty tips and tutorials from Olivia on her YouTube channel: youtube.com/olivianewmanyoung.
