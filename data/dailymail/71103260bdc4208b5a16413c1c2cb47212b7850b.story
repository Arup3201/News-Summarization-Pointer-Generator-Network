Britain is bathed in sunshine at last - but the soaring temperatures may be too little too late for ice cream sellers.

The slow start to the summer, together with declining numbers of ice cream vans, rising prices, and health concerns have all seen demand for ice cream fall, market research analysts have said.

Britain's ice cream consumption has dropped by 11 per cent since 2007 - and demand could fall by another nine per cent within the next four years, according to Mintel.

Decline: This ice cream van was doing a roaring trade in Hyde Park at the weekend, but the growing rarity of the vehicles is contributing to a fall in sales of the frozen treat, analysts say

Britons are eating 333 million litres of ice cream tubs, blocks, lollies or cones every year, according to a report in the Telegraph.

Where once they flocked to ice cream vans for a cheap, refreshing treat in the summer months, now Britons are more likely to indulge in the occasional tub of luxury ice cream from the likes of Ben & Jerry's or Haagen Dazs, said Mintel consumer analyst Peter Ayton.

Sales of 'stick' ice creams such as Cornettos or 99 flakes have dropped by almost a third over the past three years he said, adding that impulse buys from mobile sellers are down.

Just a quarter of people buy from an ice cream van now, compared with nearly 40 per cent in 2010.

'Ben & Jerry's have brought out their Core range and Haagen Dazs their Secret Sensations which cost around Â£3.50, so people have cut down on the amount they eat,' Mr Ayton said.

'When I was young, ice cream vans used to come round and there was a 'push' for parents to buy. That simply isn't happening now.'

Melting away: Sales of 'stick' ice creams like lollies, Cornettos and 99 Flakes have fallen by almost a third in three years, according to consumer research experts

Mintel said a quarter of increasingly health-conscious consumers were preoccupied by the high fat and sugar content of ice cream.

The ageing population is also impacting on sales, Mr Ayton said, as people over 55 are less likely to indulge in the traditional treat on a frequent basis.
