Carlo Ancelotti will attempt to block any move by Premier League clubs to buy Sami Khedira this January, but Real Madrid will overrule their coach if the offer comes close to their £10million valuation of the player whose contract runs out at the end of the season.

Here’s Sportsmail's assessment of who should be pushing hardest for the 27-year-old World Cup winner:

Sami Khedira celebrates winning the World Cup with Germany in Brazil in the summer

Arsenal

It’s not difficult to see why Arsenal might try to meet that evaluation as soon as the window opens and then talk wages with the German World Cup winner who was understood to be demanding over £150,000-a-week in the summer.

Khedira has all the qualities Arsene Wenger wants in the new holding midfielder he delayed buying in the summer because he believed he might end up with the German only to be outmaneuvered by Bayern Munich, who pounced for Xabi Alonso and left Real suddenly far more reluctant to sell Khedira.

In Glenn Hoddle’s Mail on Sunday column at the weekend he touched on the great Arsene Wenger sides having a solid centre – most famously with Emmanuel Petit and Partick Vieira – and Khedira fits that mould. 

Arsenal need a solid central midfielder in the mould of Patrick Vieira, and Khedira would provide that

He has the intelligence and the physical condition to screen the back four and he has the vision and technical ability to release players around him.

He might also put some spark back into fellow German World Cup winner Mesut Ozil. The pair were not that close at Madrid owing to their different tastes away from football.

Ozil would wind down socially from big games whereas Khedira would already be thinking about what might be asked of him in the next match.

But the two men are friends and if Wenger were to move Ozil into the No 10 position he would have, with Per Mertesacker and Khedira, a German World Cup winning spine to his team.

Khedira could leave Real Madrid in January if an offer of around £10million comes in

Manchester United

Just as Khedira would have an instant friend at Arsenal in Ozil, a move to Old Trafford would reunite him with Angel di Maria. 

They arrived at Real Madrid in the same summer and the two would have plenty to talk about having both felt undervalued in the Spanish capital. 

On the pitch Khedira would fit into Louis van Gaal’s team right where it appears most vulnerable. The Dutch coach turned down the chance to sign him for Bayern in Germany but his options at United are considerably worse and Khedira’s flexibility would be a major plus. 

Louis van Gaal and Manchester United could be in for the German midfielder come January

He could hold in front of the defence or even play to the left or right of a holder and release Di Maria to play further forward. 

The quietly spoken German will not be the vocal leader United have missed in the middle of the park since Roy Keane but he would be an upgrade on some of the attempts at filling his shoes in recent seasons. 

The wages that are likely to frighten Arsenal would not be a problem and the lines of communication are firmly open after the Di Maria switch this summer and Javier Hernandez’ move in the opposite direction. 

United even came close to landing Khedira on the last day of the transfer window a year ago but the offer of around £31m arrived too late for Madrid to properly consider it. It will take a lot less this time.

Manchester United have missed a tough man in the middle of the park ever since Roy Keane left

Chelsea

When Jose Mourinho took over at Real Madrid in May 2010 one of his first requests to his new club was that they buy Khedira. 

His impressive FIFA match stats from the World Cup stood up the confidence Mourinho had in him. Only Xavi and Bastian Schweinsteiger ran more in that tournament and in what FIFA call ‘high intensity activity’ Khedira came out on top. 

Carlo Ancelotti's decision to keep Khedira may be overturned if the right money is offered

His performances in Brazil despite having missed almost all of the 2013-14 season will have done nothing to change that reputation for being a multi-purpose midfield machine. 

Mourinho has Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas combining perfectly at the moment but Khedira would give him more tactical alternatives, the relationship between the pair is good enough for the player to wait until the end of the season saving Roman Abramovich the transfer fee. And boy wouldn’t it annoy Arsene?

Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger may be doing battle sooner than expected; in the transfer market
