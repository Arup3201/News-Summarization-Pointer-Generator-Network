It's a hangover cure that will be all too familiar to the party-loving supermodel.

But 'hair of the dog' took on a whole new meaning for Kate Moss as she strolled through Highgate, North London, with her canine companion.

Kate and Archie, her Staffordshire bull terrier cross, paid a visit to a dog-grooming salon with the same name on Friday.

The 39-year-old star opted for glamour over comfort for the outing. She sported tight jeans, tassled heels, a zipped jacket slung over her shoulders and a black peaked cap.

The Croydon-born supermodel and her musician husband Jamie Hince are said to be besotted with Archie, whom they acquired last June.

The pampered terrier is reported to have his own bedroom in their North London home, complete with a walk-in wardrobe where they keep his collars and coats.

Kate, an ambassador for fashion house Mango, recently admitted that having a dog was forcing her to make more sensible wardrobe choices.

She said: 'It's a nightmare. I'm having to rethink everything. You can't walk a dog in a heel.'

Meanwhile, Kate is said to have finally buried the hatchet with actress Gwyneth Paltrow - over a slice of pizza.

What can I get you! Kate and Jamie look thrilled to be stopping off on their walk for a snack

Their argument began at Sir Philip Green's 60th birthday party in Mexico last May.

Kate,
39, and Gwyneth, 40,  crossed paths at a smart North London pizza 
restaurant owned by the Soho House group and famed for its hog roast 
pizzas and macaroni cheese.

'Gwyneth
was at the Pizza East Kentish Town with husband Chris Martin, and their
kids Apple and Moses, celebrating Apple's ninth birthday with some of 
her friends,' a fellow diner reveals.

'As Gwyneth was about to leave, Kate waltzed across from the other side of the restaurant to say hello.

They
exchanged kisses and chatted for about ten minutes. Kate's husband 
Jamie Hince also came over and everything seemed really friendly.'

And they get some to takeaway! Perhaps Kate is taking some of the snacks home to her daughter Lila Grace
