After missing yesterday's engagements due to a sinus problem, the Duchess of Cornwall pulled out all the stops to look her very best as she and Prince Charles continued their royal tour of Mexico.

But Camilla was left blushing for all the wrong reasons when she turned up in a stunning creme ensemble - which was almost identical to her host's outfit.

Standing beside Gretta Salinas de Medina, the First Lady of Monterrey, the pair looked the mirror image of one another, as they made their way around the industrial city in northern Mexico.

The duo wore a matching string of pearls and discreet pearl-coloured earrings to complete their outfits.

Ms Salinas - the wife of the governor of the local state of Nuevo Leon, Rodrigo Medina - even had her remembrance poppies fitted onto her blazer in the same position as Camilla.

The outfit faux pas took place on the final day of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall's trip to Mexico.

For her last day, the duchess left her chauffeur driven car behind - and hopped onto a London bus.

Camilla boarded the red routemaster during the visit to the northern city, before quipping 'are we going to zoo?'

Seeing a London bus under grey skies after a downpour, the duchess probably felt the city was a home from home.

The number 7 bus - emblazoned with the route London to Monterrey - took her a short distance across Fundidora Park, built on the site of industrial works and now home to a museum showcasing the heavy industry of the area. 

They stepped off at a canal in the park and took a pleasure cruise around a series of waterways which featured cultural performances of dances and musicians along its route.

At one point when they hit choppy waters Camilla pulled a face as if a little concerned.

The routemaster was restored to its former glory by plastic surgeon Angel Tobar, 50, who bought it for his artist wife Marissa, 49, to use as a mobile gallery.

He said: 'This is the first time the bus has been used and it was used to take Camilla on a trip - so that's a nice way to begin.' 

Camilla sat on a makeshift seat in the bus built in 1948, as all the rest had been removed to make the routemaster into a mobile gallery.

Mr Tobar bought and restored the London bus for around 125,000 US dollars (£100,000) just over three years ago and spent the last two having it rebuilt.

He said: 'My wife found it on the internet it was in Arizona, it was taken from London in the late 1960s and it was originally owned by the man who bought London bridge.

'He didn't want it any more and sold it to someone else and that person sold it to us.' 

The Duchess of Cornwall also took a guided tour via canal boat with her host 

The duchess waved enthusiastically to those waiting to catch a glimpse of the royal visitor 

But she appeared to find parts of the trip somewhat unnerving, as shown by her concerned expression  

When Camilla first arrived with Charles at the industrial museum they were greeted by a group of performers, Ballet Folkloric Monterrey, who wore traditional costumes from the state - Stetson hats and tasselled jackets for the men and long flowing skirts for the women.

Inside a former steel foundry the royal couple saw displays showcasing local produce, dishes and crafts, from ornately decorated saddles to a traditional breakfast meal of eggs, dried beef, and onion.

The Governor of the local state of Nuevo Leon welcomed the prince and duchess in a speech and Charles spoke a few words in Spanish in return: 'Thank you for your kind welcome, Governor. My wife and I are delighted to be here in Nuevo Leon for the first time, on the final day of our visit to Mexico.'

The matching women were joined by the Prince of Wales to view a market exhibition

The market showed regional culinary traditions - which Prince Charles appeared to enjoy getting stuck into

As Charles and Camilla's four-day tour of Mexico came to a close, Duncan Taylor, Britain's Ambassador to Mexico, said the royal couple had been well received.

He said: 'The crowds of people we saw in all the regions we visited prove that there is real affection for their royal highnesses here in Mexico.

'They have visited iconic places that represent the rich diversity of this country but they have also taken so much time to meet members of the community.

'I am confident that this royal visit will give a significant boost to the relationship between our countries. A historical relationship that has been characterised by mutual respect, co-operation and friendship.'  

The royal couple went on to meet local children, who waved Union Jack flags excitedly

No doubt their lasting impression had something to do with the Prince of Wales showing off his fancy footwork a day earlier, when he delighted groups of locals with a spot of traditional dancing.   

Charles didn't have to be asked twice when the performers asked him to join them during a visit to the picturesque coastal town of Campeche on Mexico's Caribbean coast.

Twirling a handkerchief above his head and copying the men and women around him, a beaming Prince of Wales deftly tapped his feet to the music as he took part in the dance, known locally as a Sarao Campechano.

Charles' close encounter with Mr Zamorano and his troupe of dancers came as he visited Campeche's main town square, where he was scheduled to tour a number of craft stalls while meeting local dignitaries.

The large crowds waiting to see Charles were being entertained by the dance troupe, who were dressed in traditional costumes, when the royal arrived and joined in the dance.

Delighted, the crowd roared their approval before the Prince gave one final twirl and moved on, looking thrilled but more than a little relieved. 

The Duchess of Cornwall had been unable to who was forced to cancel her engagements on the penultimate day of the couple's Mexican tour because of a sinus problem.

Clearly unhappy to be without her, Prince Charles offered a brief comment on the health of his, pointing to his ear and saying: 'Sinus, such bad luck'. 

Charles laughed as he performed the movements and looked a little relieved when the dance came to an end

Charles earned the praise of dancer Carlos Javier Zamorano, 20, who joined in to help the Prince along
