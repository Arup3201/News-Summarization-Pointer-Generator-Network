A bird with a broken wing has a hero in Tennessee who designed a prosthetic one to help her maintain her balance after a botched wing amputation.

Freya the American kestrel came to the Chattanooga Nature Center a year ago from another center in Nashville.

Taylor Berry of the Nature center saw the movie Dolphin Tale about a bottlenose dolphin who was given prosthesis to replace a tail lost in a carb trap, reports The Times Free Press.

New wing: Freya the bird got a new prosthetic limb to help her balance after a botched amputation wounded her 

Concern: 'The amputation was poorly done,' said Tish Gailmard (pictured) , the nature center's director of wildlife' who helped find someone to make a stump guard for Freya 

The film inspired Berry and he wondered whether or not a prosthetic could be made for Freya who had trouble balancing due to her injury.

'We were talking about how she was kind of off-balance because of her wing,' he said.

None of the caretakers at the wildlife center know the history of the amputation but they are able to recognize how terribly done it is.

'The amputation was poorly done,' said Tish Gailmard, the nature center's director of wildlife.

Gailmard's husband knows someone at Fillauer Orthotics and Prosthetics Inc. a Chattanooga company that makes prosthesis for humans.

When Gailmard inquired as to whether they'd be interested in making a prosthetic they were flying with excitement at the opportunity.

'They were all over it,' Gailmard said.

'They put her in a patient room and treated her like a regular patient.'

Where a wing once extended was just bone jutting out that sometime bled.

Fillauer engineer Steve Edwards changed all that when he attached a prosthesis made from thermoformable composite.

Its lightweight material that has the strength of carbon fiber but is malleable when heated up.

It took Edwards just two tried to make.

'Just trying to help out, and it's rewarding, too,' he said.

'I like the challenge of these things.'

Filhauer said this isn't his first time making an animal prosthetic.

He once made a hoof for a little girl's pet donkey.

Gailmard is so appreciative for his work on Freya's stump guard.

'It probably weighs a tenth of an ounce. It's protecting her stump, and it's also restoring her balance,' she said.

'I'm so incredibly appreciative to Fillauer. They have just gone way above and beyond.'
