As a model, Olalla Oliveros appeared on billboards across Spain, but she has now swapped her glamorous life to become a nun

As a famous model, Olalla Oliveros took part in glamorous photo shoots, starred in movies, and saw her face on billboards across Spain.

But she has swapped designer outfits for blue sackcloth and a veil after joining the Order of Saint Michael and becoming a nun.

She made the decision after an 'earthquake' moment during a visit to The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima in Portugal.

She is reluctant to talk about the decision, but told the National Catholic Register: 'The Lord is never wrong. He asked if I will follow him, and I could not refuse.'

According to the site, Oliveros found the experience strange initially, but later could not shake the image of herself dressed as a nun out of her head.

That vision prompted the 36-year-old to quit her job and become a nun instead, changing her name to Sister Olalla del Sí de María.

Though Oliveros joined the order four years ago, she has only recently spoken about the decision.

She is not the first model to swap a busy life on the catwalk for a secluded existence in cloisters.

Amada Rosa Pérez was one of Colombia’s top models before becoming a nun in 2005 after becoming tired with her stressful lifetime.

She told El Tiempo: 'Being a model means 
being a benchmark, someone whose beliefs are worthy of being imitated, 
and I grew tired of being a model of superficiality.

'I grew tired of a world of lies, appearances, falsity, hypocrisy and deception, a society full of anti-values that exalts violence, adultery, drugs, alcohol, fighting, and a world that exalts riches, pleasure, sexual immorality and fraud.

'I want to be a model that promotes the true dignity of women and not their being used for commercial purposes.'
