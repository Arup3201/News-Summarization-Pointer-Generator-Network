A mother has taken to social media to pay tribute to her two-year-old daughter who died in 'suspicious circumstances' last night, while defending her boyfriend.

Anne-Marie White, 21, posted a message on Facebook today saying her daughter, Madison Horn, had died 'far too young'.

She added that the girl's death was just an accident, adding that her boyfriend, believed to be Kevin Park, would 'never hurt her'.

Witnesses say girl's 'lifeless' body was carried out of the house by medics last night after shouting was heard

Anne-Marie also used social media to defend her boyfriend, Kevin Park, who was seen being led from the property by police after Madison's body was removed

Police and ambulance crews were called to a ground floor flat in Kelty, Fife at around 6.30pm on Sunday night after concerns were raised for the child's welfare.

The two-year-old, named locally as Madison Horn, was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy but was later pronounced dead.

Officers are now investigating the death, which they described as 'suspicious'.

They said that they are 'following a positive line of enquiry' but declined to comment on whether anyone has been detained.

It is understood that Madison, who had just been accepted to nursery, was staying at the flat overnight with her mother, Anne-Marie White, 21, but did not live there permanently.

Also in the flat was Ms White's boyfriend, Kevin Park, who she had been dating since late last year.

Today, Ms White paid tribute to her daughter on Facebook - saying: 'She was just far too young.'

Speaking about the death, she added: 'Well I suppose everyone knows I lost my precious little girl last night and I know what everyone is saying, especially about Kevin.

'I just want to say that he would never hurt her. This was just an accident. It would have happened if I was in the house. He's not a bad person.

'He wouldn't let anything happen to his own kids so I'm pretty certain that he wouldn't hurt Madison. He loves her to bits. He will miss her.'

Neighbours also praised the toddler today, while speaking of their shock at the evening's events.

Police and ambulance crews were called to a flat in Fife, Scotland, yesterday evening after concerns were raised for a child's welfare. Madison was taken to hospital but later pronounced dead

Neighbours say they heard shouting before officers arrived. After the ambulance left, a witness says she saw Park being lead out by police but he was not in handcuffs

Julie Watson, 39, said: 'My mum lives opposite and she heard lots of shouting last night, although she doesn't know if it was coming from that house or the one above.

'The family have lived in that house a while. Anne Marie's mum stayed there before.'

Tearfully, Ms Watson added: 'It's shocking and so sad. She's almost [the same age as] my son, it's just terrible. I can't imagine what the family are going through.'

Catherine Pryde, 59, who lives in the neighbouring  flat, said she was first alerted to the tragedy by the sound of sirens.

She said: 'I just heard the sirens and saw the ambulance come into the street. There were a lot of police and paramedics.

'Then the baby came out - the paramedic came running out with her in his arms. She was lifeless - it was just horrible.

'The next thing I saw the boyfriend being brought out by the police - he wasn't handcuffed or anything like that, just being led away.

'I never saw her mum at all yesterday. The forensic investigators in the white suits turned up after 11pm.

'I've lived in the flat next door for 19 years and Anne-Marie moved in with her mum two or three years after me. She has that flat herself now.

Neighbours have paid tribute to the 'lovely' girl, describing her as a 'cheery wee soul'. A note pinned to the gate of the house read: 'Maddison [sic]. Heaven has gained another angel. Rest in peace little one xxxxx.

The house has remained under police guard today while forensic officers examine the property

'Madison was a cheery wee soul. I used to see her out in the back garden playing all the time.

'There's no dividing fence between our gardens and she'd always make a bid for freedom and come running to our garden.

'She was a wee blond haired girl - a lovely looking wee girl. It's awful for it to happen to a little girl.'

Cousin Courtney Munro wrote on Facebook: 'RIP to my little cousin Madison, sleep tight angel.'

Another neighbour pinned a tribute to the gate of the house along with a teddy bear, a doll and an angel ornament.

The note read: 'Maddison [sic]. Heaven has gained another angel. Rest in peace little one xxxxx.'

Police Scotland said the death is being treated as suspcious but that enquiries are at an early stage.

Officers were stationed at the door of the flat as investigations continued.

A spokesman for Police Scotland's Fife Division said: 'Police in Fife responded to a call at Croftangry Road, Kelty at 6.30pm on Sunday 20th April with a report of concern for a two-year-old girl.

'She was taken to Victoria Hospital, where she was later pronounced dead.

'Enquiries are at an early stage but police are treating her death as suspicious.'

tributes have been left tied to the front gate of the house. Local MP and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also issued a statement paying tribute to the girl

Local MP and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and local MSP Alex Rowley, both Labour, said in a joint statement: 'Kelty is a strong close knit community and there is universal sadness at the tragic death of a two-year-old girl last night.

'We know that the whole community will come together to mourn the loss of a child who has been taken from us at such a young age and we support those closest to her.

'We also know that all possible help will be given to the police and the hospital authorities as they investigate the tragedy.'

A team of forensic officers was at the property this afternoon examining the scene.

More than a dozen soft toys and bouquets have been placed at the gate of the two-storey house by passing residents.

A teddy was laid with the note: 'Rest in peace little Madison, now you're in the arms of the angels.'

A message attached to a bunch of purple tulips read: 'Sleep tight little angel. Taken far too soon.'
