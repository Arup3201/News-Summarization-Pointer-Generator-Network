 

A UK health worker pricked with a needle while treating Ebola sufferers in Sierra Leone has been flown to the UK and admitted to a London hospital for monitoring.

Public Health England today confirmed the worker has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London for monitoring.

A spokesman stressed the person has not been diagnosed with the deadly disease and do not have symptoms.

It is also understood he or she is not in an isolation unit.

The person is the fifth British healthcare worker to be flown back to the UK to be treated for the virus, which has killed more than 9,500 people.

British nurses Will Pooley and Pauline Cafferkey were flown back in August and December last year, a military healthworker was flown back in January 2015 and an aid worker was evacuated earlier this month.

They were all treated at the Royal Free in London, the only hospital in the UK with an isolation unit which has two high-security containment beds.

A Public Health England spokesperson today said: 'We can confirm that a UK healthcare worker, who has had potential contact with the Ebola virus while working in Sierra Leone, has been transported to the UK for assessment and monitoring.

'The individual has not been diagnosed with Ebola and does not currently have any symptoms.

'The person was working in the field treating people with Ebola and they basically pricked themself with a needle during that treatment.

'It's possible there's no virus in the needle - the monitoring is a precaution more than anything else.'

He added: 'On arrival in the UK, the healthcare worker was transferred to the Royal Free Hospital for assessment.

'They will be monitored for any symptoms for the remainder of their incubation period, in line with standard procedures.'

Both Will Pooley, Pauline Cafferkey and the military health worker flown back to the UK were treated at the Royal Free Hospital, in an isolated ward to stop the spread of infection.

The Public Health England spokesperson said the health worker admitted today is not in an isolation unit.

They said: 'When Pauline Cafferkey had Ebola - that's when you go into isolation.

'This person hasn't been diagnosed with Ebola - it wouldn't be the same level of risk, so I doubt it.'

Professor Paul Cosford, PHE's director for health protection and medical director, added: 'The overall risk to the general public from Ebola remains very low.

'We are confident all appropriate public health actions have been, and will continue to be, taken to support this individual and to protect the public's health.

'The courage shown by every volunteer, in helping those affected in West Africa and to prevent the spread of Ebola any wider, should be recognised.'

As of the beginning of this month, there have been a total of 23, 539 cases of Ebola confirmed and 951 deaths since the outbreak began, according to figures from the World Health Organization and the U.S.’ Centers for Disease Control and Protection.

The news comes after earlier this month an international team of scientists said it is 'very likely' that the Ebola virus will mutate to become an airborne virus, making it infinitely more deadly.

They reviewed past studies examining past outbreaks of Ebola within human populations, as well as animal studies. 

Writing in the journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team noted research where healthy animals kept at a distance from infected ones died from the virus.

However they acknowledged the primary form of transmission will be through contact with the bodily fluids of an Ebola patient.
