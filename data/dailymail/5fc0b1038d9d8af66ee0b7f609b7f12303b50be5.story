A Pittsburgh man is facing rape and incest charges after he allegedly abused a female relative for two decades and fathered four children with her.

Clifford Raynovich, 56, of Chicora, has been arrested for 71 violations of the Criminal Crimes Code.According to Pennsylvania state police, the alleged abuse against the 33-year-old victim began in November of 1992, when she was just 13. It lasted until August of this year.

The victim was raped in different locations through Allegheny and Butler counties, investigators said.Raynovich is now facing a list of charges, including rape, incest, statutory rape, indecent assault and aggravated indecent assault.

State Trooper Gesuele A. Burello, who filed the charges, could not be reached for additional information.

Raynovich remained in the Butler County Prison Saturday after he failed to post $500,000 cash bond.

It's unclear how the woman's nightmare finally came to an end or why it was allowed to go on for so long.

However, it appears to mirror the story of New Jersey woman Aziza Kibibi, whose father - an MTV award-winning producer for the Fugees - raped her from the age of eight, getting her pregnant five times.

Kibibi opened up about the horrific abuse in August after her father Aswad Ayinde was sentenced to 50 years in prison on July 26.

She told NJ.com how he told her he was teaching her 'how to be a woman' as he forced himself on her and claimed he was attempting to create a 'pure' bloodline.

'He told me I was special. Initially, it was to teach me to be a woman,' she said. 'By the time he started having intercourse with me, he was getting more and more violent. When I would start fighting him, he would hit me. It was more about threats.'

Ayinde who is also known as Charles McGill won fame after directing The Fugees' 'Killing Me Softly' video.

The incredibly brave woman is now 35, married and running a promising baking business. Most of her five children have a rare genetic disorder due to inbreeding, however.
