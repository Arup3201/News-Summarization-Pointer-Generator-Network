A British holidaymaker was gored so badly by a bull during a festival in a Spanish village that he had to be stapled back together and still can't return home more than a fortnight later.

Peter Mayne, 41, was mauled by the half ton beast after joining in the ancient tradition of bull running in small village near the popular resort of Benidorm.

The former soldier needed 150 stitches and staples to help close gaping wounds in his leg and torso which were caused when the bull rammed him into railings.

Gouged: British holidaymaker Peter Mayne is mauled by a bull during a Spanish festival near Benidorm

A horrifying video of the freak accident at Bous al Carrer festival has been viewed by thousands of people on You Tube.

Tube worker Mr Mayne jetted off to Benidorm with his wife Mandy, 43, and step-daughter Hannah Chamberlain, 18.

The family had always planned to attend the festival in the small village of Calpe which sees bulls let loose and run through the streets.

Mr Mayne was posing for photos as his family waited for the bulls to tear past them - but within moments tragedy struck.

One of the powerful beasts came hurtling towards Mr Mayne and threw him into the air as hundreds of spectators watched on.

The Briton, who was wearing a bright pink shirt which may have enraged the animal, desperately clung onto its horns but was soon crushed up against a row of metal railings.

In the video footage a spanish local can be seen pulling on the animal's tail in a bid to save Mr Mayne, who was eventually pulled by his legs back into the concerned crowd.

The half-ton animal was soon pacified leaving Mr Mayne's terrified family to call for the Spanish emergency services.

Mr Mayne, from Herne Bay, Kent, was taken to a nearby hospital where he remains, too fragile to be transported back to the UK.

The couple spent their 13th wedding anniversary last week in Calpe.

His concerned step-daughter Hannah, who flew home after the accident on August 6, yesterday relived the terrifying ordeal.

Hannah, who has just left college, said: 'He was having his photo taken when it happened. He thought the bull was nowhere near him. Then it turned around and ran.

'We couldn't see when it was happening but we knew it wasn't good. I was just scared.

'It was quite an open wound and he was in a lot of pain. Within 10 minutes he was leaving in an ambulance.

'Luckily, all his internal organs and arteries were missed.'

Hannah added: 'I have spoken to him but there has not been any change. He's just waiting to come home.

'He had about 150 stitches and staples and is still stuck in a wheelchair.

'He seems okay but there is no indication when he can leave. He cannot fly until his stitches have healed up because of the pressure.'

In 2011, a 50-year-old Spanish man was killed by a bull at the same festival.

A Spanish spectator eventually managed to pull the animal away by its tail and Mr Mayne was dragged to safety
