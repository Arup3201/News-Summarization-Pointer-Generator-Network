Babies born at the weekend are 13 per cent more likely to come to harm.

Staff shortages mean maternity units are being left in the hands of junior doctors who have to rely on calling consultants at home.

The National Audit Office research shows that one in 65 babies delivered in English hospitals during the week suffer some form of harm. But at weekends, the ratio rises to one in 60 – a 13 per cent higher risk.

Complications include brain damage, spinal injury, broken bones and scarring to the head and face.

These happen when doctors and midwives fail to act quickly enough, either during labour difficulties or during an intervention such as a caesarean section.

The risk of infection to mother and baby was also shown to be significantly higher in weekend births.

Research has consistently found that patients are up to 10 per cent more likely to die if admitted to hospital at weekends – rising to 80 per cent if they undergo surgery.

This month the NHS’s medical director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, will publish a report calling for hospitals to offer better weekend care. 

The audit office report says the NHS spends half a billion pounds a year paying compensation and legal fees to victims of blunders during childbirth – a fifth of the maternity care budget.

Staffing: Separate figures from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists published in September found that a third of maternity units have no consultants at the weekends

Joyce Robins, of the group Patient Concern, said: ‘Babies aren’t just born Mondays to Fridays.

‘It is very frightening that babies 
may be suffering complications that will be with them for the rest of 
their lives just because the right person wasn’t around at the weekend.

‘It’s
extraordinary that doctors’ schedules allow them to only work Monday to
Friday when babies are born and people become ill round the clock on 
all days of the week.’ 

The
report warned most maternity units are left solely in the hands of 
‘doctors in training’ – junior medics – at weekends with a consultant 
available on the phone.

These senior doctors can live up to 30 minutes away by car and may not arrive quickly enough in an emergency.

Separate figures from the Royal College 
of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists published in September found that a 
third of maternity units have no consultants at the weekends. Just half 
employed their most senior member of staff to work during the evening – 
usually up to 8pm – and three quarters did not have any working 
overnight.

Worry: Complications including brain damage and scarring to the head and face can happen when doctors and midwives fail to act quickly enough

Margaret Hodge, the Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: ‘The current system is not working as it should. I find it absolutely scandalous that one fifth of all funding for maternity services is spent on clinical negligence cover.’

The audit office said a lack of consultant cover was not the sole reason for the greater risk at weekends because fewer midwives and other specialists work these hours.

It also found that babies born in hospitals in England are far more likely to die than elsewhere in the UK and Europe. The mortality rate is 7.5 per 1,000 births in England compared with 6.9 in Scotland, 6.6 in Wales, 6.4 in Northern Ireland and 5.5 in Germany.

A total of 1,146 compensation claims were made last year – a rise of 80 per cent in five years.
