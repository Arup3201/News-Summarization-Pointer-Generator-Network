UEFA president Michel Platini has threatened to hand Franck Ribery a three-match ban if he refuses to join up with the French national team - despite the fact the Bayern Munich attacker has retired from international football.

Ribery, who missed the 2014 World Cup through injury, announced his retirement from the international scene in August.

However Platini claims Ribery's decision to retire from international duty is out of his hands as Les Bleus coach Didier Deschamps has the final say on who he chooses to select in his squad.

Stern warning: UEFA president Michel Platini has had his say on Franck Ribery's international career

Commitment: Ribery wants to concentrate on his club career with Bundesliga side Bayern Munich

Public backing: Platini has revealed Ribery's international future rests with France boss Didier Deschamps

Ribery, 31, said at the time of his retirement that he felt it was time for France's younger players  to be given prominent roles in the national team squad.

Former France  boss Platini, speaking to Bild, said of his compatriot's international future: 'It is not the decision of the players, whether they come to the national team. This is the decision of the coach.

'If there is disagreement between Lahm and [Joachim] Low, the Germany coach will no longer call on him, that's one thing. But basically it is not Lahm's decision, it's Low's.

'[With Ribery] it's a very different situation. Franck Ribery cannot simply decide whether he plays for France or not. If coach Didier Deschamps invites him, he must come to the national team.

'This is defined in the Fifa statutes. If he does not come, he is suspended for three games with Bayern Munich. I don't understand him anyway. He is French, the European Championship in 2016 will take place in France!'

Youth policy: Ribery believes it is time for France's young players to step up to the plate

Added bonus: Pep Guardiola may benefit from Ribery's decision to retire from international football
