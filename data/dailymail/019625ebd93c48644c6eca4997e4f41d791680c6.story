Heart attack victims can enjoy a healthy recovery if they look on the bright side of life, research found

Heart attack victims can enjoy a healthy recovery if they look on the bright side of life, research found.

Pessimists who grumble through life were twice as likely to suffer another heart attack, require surgery or even die, compared with more cheerful patients.

That is according to a group of scientists at University College London who spent four years studying the mental attitudes of 369 patients admitted to hospital with unstable angina and heart attacks.

While it is widely known that optimism is linked to better heart health, this is the first study to look at the impact of a patient’s attitude after suffering a heart attack.

The team said their findings could be linked to physical and psychological impacts of being optimistic, such as smoking and healthy eating.

Smoking has long been known to be a major risk factor for heart attack and angina, with an estimated 22,000 deaths each year from cardiovascular disease linked to smoking.

And this study showed that half of the most pessimistic patients who smoked were still smoking on year after going into hospital.

By contrast, 85 per cent of optimistic smokers kicked the habit entirely.

Positive patients are also more likely to aid their recovery by eating more fruit and vegetables after their incident – some 40 per cent of them ate the recommended five-a-day, compared with just 20 per cent of pessimists.

However, the study did find that optimistic patients were no more likely to do more exercise than pessimists.

Lead author of the research, Professor Steptoe, said: ‘Our research shows that optimistic people are more likely to take advice about lifestyle changes on board, like quitting smoking and eating more healthily – this results in better outcomes after a patient suffers from unstable angina or a heart attack.

‘Our findings could be used to identify pessimistic patients and encourage them to make the necessary changes to their lifestyle that can ultimately lead to better health.’

Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director of the British Heart Foundation, added: ‘Suffering from a serious condition like angina or heart attack can take a drastic emotional toll, which we know can lead to depression, further lowering the chances of a full recovery after a heart attack.

‘If you’re living with a heart condition and struggling to cope, we would urge you to contact your GP who can put you in touch with the necessary support.’

Depression has also been linked to poor outcomes for heart patients.

These findings discovered that pessimistic patients were twice as likely to have depressive symptoms a year after suffering a heart attack or unstable angina.

The experts hope their study will help identify the patients most at risk of suffering serious health complications in the years after recovering from heart problems.

The study was published in Psychosomatic Medicine.
