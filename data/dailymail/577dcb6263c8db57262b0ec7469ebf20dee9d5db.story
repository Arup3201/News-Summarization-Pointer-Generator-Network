A multi-millionaire businessman responsible for storing some of the greatest art treasures and luxury goods in the world has been arrested on suspicion of fraud.

Yves Bouvier - whose rich and famous clients include many from Britain - was placed in custody in Monaco on Wednesday night, along with two alleged accomplices.

It follows a complaint about his so-called 'Freeports' - vast repositories where ultra-high net worth individuals keep their treasures.

Yves Bouvier was detained in Monaco, along with two alleged accomplices, in a fraud case centred around his ownership of Luxembourg Freeport, allegedly used to manipulate prices in the art market

They include everything from priceless paintings to top marque cars, fine wines and cigars, with Mr Bouvier insisting all would be kept safe and under conditions of utter secrecy.

This had led to accusations that they are being used to avoid tax, and even to fence off stolen property before it is sold.

A source close to Monaco prosecutors today confirmed that the current investigation centres on Mr Bouvier's deposit in Luxembourg, and attempts to 'manipulate art prices'.

The £50m Luxembourg Freeport is situated in the cargo centre of the Grand Duchy's Findel airport, and occupies a bomb-proof 11,000 square metre building.

It contains state-of the-art facilities for storing cars, wine, cigars, art works, and other luxury items, including precious metals.

Mr Bouvier, who also owns the Singapore Freeport, insisted that his so-called 'bonded-area' was completely above board, even though similar complexes have been linked with smuggling and other illicit activity.

The Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev, owner of Monaco football club, is thought to be one of his victims.

Tetiana Bersheda, a lawyer representing Mr Rybolovlev, said in a statement that an 'investigation has been launched by the judicial authorities of Monaco against Mr Yves Bouvier, one of the most famous people in the world of art who is the owner of the free ports of Singapore, Geneva and Luxembourg among others.

'After having worked for more than 10 years with Mr Bouvier, the Rybolovlev family received some information about possible fraud and manipulation of prices on the art market by Mr Bouvier and his accomplices.

'The scope and all the victims of the fraudulent scheme created by Mr Bouvier have not yet been identified at this time.'

Mr Rybolovlev is one of the richest men in the world, with an art collection which includes Monets, Picassos and Van Goghs.

There was no immediate comment from representatives of Mr Bouvier about his arrest.

David Arendt, managing director of the Luxembourg Freeport, said last year: 'The legislative framework under which the Luxembourg Freeport operates guarantees total traceability of all goods stored and ensures that all activities strictly comply with international standards.

He added: 'The Luxembourg Freeport has eight showrooms and a spectacular lobby designed to display the goods in storage.'

Shell are among companies who have called for the closure of 'bonded areas' in the Philippines, where oil smuggling costs hundreds of millions of dollars in lost tax revenue every year.

In 2003 the authorities in Switzerland, where there are numerous similar centres, announced they would return hundreds of antiques stolen from Egypt and then stored.

Richtung22, a pressure group campaigning against tax avoidance, said the Luxembourg site was typical of many being used to avoid tax, and to cover up other illegal activity.
