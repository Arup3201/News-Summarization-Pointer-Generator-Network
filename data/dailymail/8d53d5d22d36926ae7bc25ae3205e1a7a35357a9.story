Probes sent to Mars usually use a soft landing system that causes them to bounce several times before coming to a standstill.

But Nasa needs to be more accurate when it comes to putting humans on the red planet, and it is hoping Space X's Falcon 9 rocket could help.

The space agency recently teamed up with Elon Musk's firm to record thermal footage of the Falcon 9 rocket as its first stage pulled away and burned through the atmosphere.

The first stage is the part of the rocket that is ignited at launch and burns through the rocket's ascent until it runs out of propellant.

At this point it is discarded from the second stage and returns to Earth.

According to Nasa, its descent back to Earth presents Mars-like conditions, which means data collected could help plan a future mission to the red planet.

With an failure rate of 66 per cent, the entry, descent and landing phase of the Mars mission is the key part of any mission to the red planet.

Mars' surface pressure is less than one per cent of Earth’s, which is not enough to slow down an aircraft from its entry speed of more than 12,000mph (19,000 km/h).

The upgraded Falcon 9 v1.1 has engines that are 60 per cent more powerful than previous versions

Private spaceflight company, SpaceX, successfully launched the first of its newly-improved Falcon 9 rockets in September. 

The nine-engine rocket is its most powerful to date and designed to test the viability of using fully reusable launch vehicles for future missions.

Currently, after delivering their payloads into orbit, booster rockets tumble back toward Earth and essentially explode mid-air before crashing into the sea.

This is a costly operation causing the price of launches to top £280 million.

Space X, however, is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on Earth so that they can be recovered and recycled. 

During September's launch, three first-stage engines were reignited, to see if they could bring the first-stage of the rocket segment down through the atmosphere intact.

Another engine was then used to try to slow the stage still further just before it touched the water.

'Nestled inside the rocket's new 17-foot (5-metre) diameter nose cone was a small Canadian science satellite called Cassiope that initially was to fly on SpaceX's now-discontinued Falcon 1

The most revolutionary thing about the new Falcon 9 is the potential ability to recover the boost phase, which is almost three-quarters of the cost of the rocket,' Musk added.

The upgraded Falcon 9 v1.1 has engines that are 60 per cent more powerful than previous versions, longer fuel tanks, new avionics and software intended to boost lift capacity and simplify operations for commercial service.

To record the descent of Falcon 9, the agency equipped two planes with infrared cameras and had them film the controlled flight which took place in Cape Canaveral in September.

On launch day, the planes reached their observation locations about 50 miles (80km) from the projected rocket trajectory.

Video footage from the planes revealed the thermal energy given off by the rocket as it fell to Earth at supersonic speeds.

'Because the technologies required to land large payloads on Mars are significantly different than those used here on Earth, investment in these technologies is critical,' said Robert Braun, principal investigator for Nasa Propulsive Descent Technologies (PDT).

Mars' surface pressure is less than one per cent of Earth’s, which is not enough to slow down an aircraft from its entry speed of more than 12,000mph (19,000 km/h)

'This is the first high-fidelity data set of a rocket system firing into its direction of travel while traveling at supersonic speeds in Mars-relevant conditions.

Nasa chiefs have said that sending a manned mission to Mars is 'necessary if the human race is to survive'.

The space agency is currently developing the capabilities needed to capture an asteroid by 2015 and send humans to by 2030.

As well as making the daring 34-million-mile journey through space, once at Mars astronauts will have to contend with the cold, barren landscape of Mars. 

The planet has violent winds with dust storms that engulf the planet for months at a time. It never rains and temperatures drop to -90°C at night.
