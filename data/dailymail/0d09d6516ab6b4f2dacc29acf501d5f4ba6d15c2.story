Eileen Rockefeller sheds light on what it was like growing up in one of America's wealthiest and most powerful families, in her new memoir Being a Rockefeller, Becoming Myself.

The youngest of David and Margaret Rockefeller’s six children, and great-granddaughter of oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, now aged 61, pushes the message that money doesn't buy happiness.

She reveals that her during her childhood her mother battled severe depression, her billionaire father spent more time in the boardroom than at home and she struggled to find a sense of self-worth beyond her iconic family name.

She told CBS: 'There is no question 
that the privileges have way outweighed the responsibilities, the 
difficulties. But where I think I feel common ground with everybody 
watching is that we all suffer from something growing up.

'It
doesn't matter if we have money or don't have money; we suffer in our 
own ways. And the net worth of our bank account is not nearly so 
important, ultimately, as the self-worth.'

Eileen, who split her time between lavish mansions in Manhattan, St Barts, Maine and New Jersey as a child, now lives a more rustic life on an organic farm in Vermont, with her businessman husband Paul Growald.

'It doesn't matter if we have money or don't have money; we suffer in our own ways'

She told The Daily Beast that it was only until recently that she found a sense of identity.

Her journey of self-discovery involved years of therapy and she gained further emotional support from her network of 22 cousins, many of whom have changed their names to avoid scrutiny.

In the first chapter of her book titled, The Story I Didn’t Want to Tell, Eileen touches on how she constantly felt 'subsumed by the enormity of accomplishment' that had gone before her.

Detached parenting: Eileen says that her billionaire father David Sr spent more time in the boardroom than at home when she was growing up

Indeed, her industrialist grandfather 
founded the Standard Oil Company with his brother in 1870, which helped 
him to amass a net worth of $340billion.

Meanwhile her father David Sr, who celebrated his 98th birthday this June, made a name for himself as a leading New York banker, serving as CEO and chairman for Chase Bank.

'In high school where I attempted to write about my family I would just feel overwhelmed by how much had been accomplished'

'Every time in any high school paper, college paper, where I had attempted to write anything about my family I would just feel overwhelmed by how much had been accomplished and no matter what I did I would feel so small,' Eileen told The Daily Beast.

In his memoir released in 2003, David Sr touched on how his late wife of 55 years suffered from bouts of acute depression.

And in her account, Eileen reveals how her mother's unpredictable behavior impacted on her most formative years.

Fond memories: Eileen would frequently visit Kykuit growing up, a 40-room National Trust house in Westchester County, New York, built by her oil tycoon great-grandfather, John D. Rockefeller

'She was all sunshine. But when she got in her dark moods, she was very much removed, and could be angry,' she explained.

But with her father focused on his finance career and her five 'highly competitive' older siblings - David Jr, Abigail. Neva, Peggy and Richard - ignoring her, Eileen said she had nowhere to turn.

'For two years I felt like an only child because I was really the only one at home. I certainly didn’t feel I belonged.' she recalled.

'Our name has extraordinary convening power. I could call up anybody and get a meeting'

However, over the years she says she managed to find ways of bonding with her family.

'I say in the book, I taught [my parents] to hug at a time when hugging wasn’t yet fashionable.'

Away from the boardroom she said that her father had a great love of the outdoors and a bizarre passion for collecting beetles. His collection includes 150,000 different specimens.

Other favorite hobbies to this day include horse and carriage driving, sailing, art collecting and traveling.

Eileen, who has two grown sons, is the first woman in her family to write a memoir about her world famous clan.

Writing debut: Eileen's candid memoir took her six years to complete and features a picture of her father on the cover

It took her six years to complete and 
features a picture of her father on the cover. Before going to print, all
of the people mentioned were given a copy to vet.

'There will be no surprises,' she said, adding that it’s probably a ‘more public [discourse] than some of them would choose.’

Writing aside, Eileen spends much of her time on philanthropy; one of her current causes is fighting global warming.

Her key messages for the next generation, adopted from her husband, are to travel, 'because it will give you perspective', and to realize the importance of education.

Today she says the fifth and sixth generations of the Rockefeller family are more weighted towards business, because the 'money can only spread so far' and private funds have become 'disbursed'.

While she says that being a Rockefeller has been somewhat of a curse, she admits there are plus points and she decided to keep her name for many reasons.

She concluded: 'It will get you through the door [and] has extraordinary convening power.

'I could call up anybody, the Chancellor of Memorial Sloan Kettering, and get a meeting.'
