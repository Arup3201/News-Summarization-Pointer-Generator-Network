Payoff: Former Barclays Bank chief operating officer Jerry del Missier has received a cash payoff worth almost £9million

A Barclays boss who resigned in disgrace over the interest rate rigging scandal has been handed a cash payoff worth almost £9million, it emerged last night.

Jerry del Missier will receive the £8.75million windfall despite ordering traders to manipulate crucial interest rates used to set mortgages and trillions of pounds in complex investments.

Barclays was fined £290million by US and UK regulators over the scandal last month, leading to the resignation of chief executive Bob Diamond and chairman Marcus Agius.

News of the windfall emerged on the day that Alison Carnwath – chairman of the bank’s remuneration committee which sets bonuses – also quit for ‘personal reasons’.

It is not known whether her resignation was in protest against the award for Mr del Missier, which is set to spark another row about the bonus culture in the City.

Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of the High Pay Commission, said: ‘This is staggering. Why on earth should this man get a multi-million pound payoff for resigning in disgrace? This is further proof that the whole system of bonuses needs to be urgently reformed.’

It is thought that the Canadian banker’s award represents just over half of a potential £17million long-term incentive award made to him several years ago and which matured in March.

Insiders say Mr Diamond’s former right-hand man and chief operating officer was persuaded to delay receiving the bonus because of escalating public anger over pay.

The windfall is thought to have been settled on to secure Mr del Missier’s signature on his severance package. It comes despite promises from Barclays, and led by Alison Carnwath as the executive in charge of pay at the bank, to claw back bonuses from Mr Diamond and fellow directors.

Mr Diamond forfeited bonuses worth up to £20million amid a growing public outcry but still walked away with a £2million package.

But Mr del Missier’s decision to pocket the cash will mean he will join his former colleague as a lightning rod for criticism over rewards for failure.

Earlier this month he was identified as the Barclays executive who instructed junior colleagues to rig benchmark Libor rates, used to set mortgages, during the financial crisis.

In an appearance before the Treasury Select Committee of MPs last week he claimed he was instructed to do so by Mr Diamond following a phone call between his former boss and Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England.

Tom Powdrill from shareholder lobby group Pirc, said: ‘This is enough to make you sick. Barclays must make it clear immediately if there was any discretion involved in this settlement, and if so they should make clear which directors approved it.

‘In any case this decision is likely to incense shareholders, particularly if any of the payoff includes rewards relating to the period in which the bank was involved in Libor manipulation.’

Barclays refused to comment. But the bank is understood to have felt it could not legally claw back the cash payout to Mr del Missier, given he was entitled to receive it in the spring.

It is unclear whether he will be able to keep separate share options thought to be worth tens of millions of pounds.
