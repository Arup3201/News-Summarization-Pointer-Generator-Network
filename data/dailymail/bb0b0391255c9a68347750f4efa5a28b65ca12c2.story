Blossoming romance: Prince William and Kate Middleton are said to have fallen in love at the flat they shared while studying at St Andrews University

Prince William and Kate Middleton’s university landlady has revealed how she almost turned away the future King – because she wasn’t sure how he would behave ‘off the leash’.

The couple are said to have fallen in love at the flat they shared with two other friends – Fergus Boyd and Olivia Bleasdale – while studying at St Andrews University.

But the flat was almost refused to them. Speaking publicly for the first time, landlady Charlotte Smith said she initially decided against renting her Victorian terrace to the Prince because she had a ‘no-boys’ policy.

She said: ‘We’d had an unfortunate experience with some boys in the flat once before and we were determined not to have young men there again.

‘Broken furniture, broken windows – there was a lot of damage, so that put us off really.

'I said to this young lady we’d really rather not have more boys and she said, "What if I were to tell you that it was Prince William?".

'I said, "I still don’t want to do it, thank you. I’d rather not do that" because I didn’t know how he was going to behave off the leash, as it were.

I said I’d talk to my husband about it and get back to her. ‘My husband and I discussed it and he talked me round. We were really quite surprised that they should choose my flat, but it was very nice with ample living space in the centre of town and it had the reputation for being one of the best flats for comfort in St Andrews.

‘We wanted to talk it over with our neighbours and they were all right with it. So we decided we would go ahead and let the flat to Prince William.’

Mrs Smith said despite her initial concerns, William and Kate turned out to be ‘ideal tenants’.

She also revealed that William, whom she described as a ‘very friendly, very charming … thoroughly nice man’, did not try to negotiate on the ‘very reasonably priced’ rent.

She added: ‘We arranged to meet Kate Middleton, Fergus and Olivia before they moved in but we thought we’d better not ask to see Prince William because we thought his credit rating must be quite good. But he insisted on meeting us.’

Speaking about Kate, Mrs Smith said: ‘She was very friendly. She had her younger brother there at the time – I think just visiting – and she was very caring, making sure that he knew what was going on. They came across as a very nice group of people.’

But she kept tight-lipped about the fledging Royal romance: ‘I imagine that they all got on very well together,decided to take the flat and whatever happened then happened.’
