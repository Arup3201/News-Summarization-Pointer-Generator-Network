The Rugby Football League has ruled out the prospect of introducing two referees for every match next season.

The RFL has been considering following the lead set by the NRL in Australia of having two officials in charge of all games, and trialled the system in academy fixtures this summer.

RFL chief operating officer Ralph Rimmer said the feedback from the experiment is still being assessed and that more trials will take place in 2015, including some in Super League matches.

Rimmer said: "The two-referee system clearly has its merits but there is still some work to do, including trials in Super League fixtures next season.

"With so many other changes taking place next season, the board believe that it would not be appropriate to operate a two-referee system in 2015 but we remain committed to exploring the option for 2016."

The RFL has launched a recruitment drive to encourage more people to take up refereeing.
