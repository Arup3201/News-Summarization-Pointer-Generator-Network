Behind bars: Wayne Crompton has been jailed for ten years after he mowed down two police officers

A driver who mowed down two policemen trying to arrest him has been jailed for ten years.

Wayne Crompton, 36, was on a six-month driving ban when he knocked over two officers who had stopped him for driving on the wrong side of the road.

The officers suffered fractures and are still recovering from the incident which took place in Harpurhey, Manchester, in February this year.

PC John McGreggor, 27, sustained three fractures to his skull as Crompton suddenly reversed, knocking him unconscious with the driver’s door.

Crompton then shot forward at PC Richard Hayes, 34, who was standing in front of the car, attempting to stop him by using his Taser gun.

PC Hayes flew onto the vehicle’s bonnet and was carried for 30 feet before he was thrown off, suffering a broken wrist.

Crompton sped from the scene, leaving the two men sprawled on the ground outside a convenience store.

Despite his injury, PC Hayes managed to take down the full registration plate of Crompton’s borrowed Hyundai, and was able to call for back-up.

The car, belonging to a friend of Crompton’s, could be traced and he was arrested at a house 16 miles away where the car was seized.

A warrant had already been issued for Crompton’s arrest in the weeks before the incident after he failed to attend court following a string of other motoring offences.

At the time of the incident, Crompton, of Whitefield, Manchester, was serving a six month driving ban which had been imposed in November 2012.

Unemployed Crompton, who claims sickness benefits, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, dangerous driving, aggravated vehicle taking, driving while disqualified and driving with no insurance at a previous hearing at Manchester Crown Court.

Sentencing him to ten years in prison today, Judge Andrew Gilbart QC, told him: ‘Two police officers doing their job stopped you. You resented that.

‘You reversed suddenly, knocking Mr McGreggor over. Mr Hayes tried to stop you with a Taser. You drove at him. I have no doubt you used the car as a weapon.’

Dangerous driving: Crompton was stopped outside this shop and as one got out, he reversed, knocking the PC unconscious, before speeding forwards forcing the other officer onto his car bonnet

Crompton, who must serve a minimum of six and a half years, has a lengthy criminal record, including many offences of taking vehicles without consent.

He also injured himself in a crash in 2006 when he ploughed into an HGV at high speed, which led to the removal of his spleen.

He was jailed in 2007 for assaulting his ex-partner and threatening to set her alight after pouring petrol over her body, the court was told.

Judge Gilbart said he was satisfied the defendant was a dangerous offender and imposed an extended licence period of three years on top of his ten-year term.

Judge Gilbart also banned Crompton from driving for seven years and ordered him to take an extended test before he could get behind the wheel again.

PCs McGreggor and Hayes remain off work, but are said to be recovering. PC McGreggor still has short-term memory loss and faces a long recovery.

Manchester Crown Court heard the consequences for both could have been far worse.

Detective Inspector Mark Tootill from Greater Manchester Police said after the case: ‘Only Crompton knows what possessed him to react in such a dangerous way.

‘He may well have panicked knowing that he was already banned from driving and was wanted by the police, and in a moment of stupidity deliberately drove at these two officers to flee the scene.

‘As a result, the two officers sustained injuries and needed hospital treatment. This clearly caused their families a great deal of anxiety and distress but thankfully they are both now recovering well at home.
