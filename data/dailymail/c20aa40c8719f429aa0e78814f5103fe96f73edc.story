Crystal Palace have failed in a £3.5million swoop for Swansea left-back Neil Taylor.

The Welsh club rejected the bid on Thursday night for the 25-year-old, who is also is a target for West Bromwich Albion. 

Taylor is entering the final 18 months of his contract at Swansea City and Garry Monk is said to be searching the market for left backs, suggesting a deal could be done this window.

Baggies boss Tony Pulis has been unconvinced by Sebastien Pocognoli, preferring to start Chris Baird in the win over Hull City, and is keen to do extensive business in January.

Palace have been desperate for a natural left back with Joel Ward and Martin Kelly asked to cover their weaker flank frequently this season.

Taylor, who has 20 Wales caps, has been a regular for Swansea this season after Ben Davies’ departure to Tottenham Hotspur.
