A mother-of-three drove a stolen car right into the middle of an annual police charity event in Florida.

Tesia Cain, 22, took the vehicle straight into the hands of authorities, who had just received an alert that it was in the vicinity.

Also in the car was Cain's boyfriend, Dwayne Durham, 24, who was in possession of a loaded handgun, some marijuana, and her three children - ages 5, 4 and 4 months.

Two dozen Boynton Beach policemen had gathered in the local Walmart parking lot for their department's annual Shop-with-a-Cop event for underprivileged children.

Officers were informed that there was a stolen car in the area and then Cain rolled into the parking lot in a vehicle matching the exact description.

Police spokeswoman Stephanie Slater told WPBF: 'That's irony at it's best. You know, you have a parking lot full of police officers and a 
stolen car coming right to them, so it was perfect for us.'

Cain was pulled over and initially told police that the car was on loan from friend, but wasn't able to produce any more details.

As reported in the Palm Beach Post, 
police said: 'Investigation revealed this vehicle to be a confirmed 
stolen vehicle with Cain in direct control/operating it.'

When officers checked Cain's boyfriend Durham, they found he was carrying a loaded .45-caliber handgun in his waist band.

Police also found marijuana in Cain's wallet and none of the three children was wearing safety belts.

The children were put into the custody of their father, while Cain and Durham are both now in jail.

Durham told authorities he didn't 
recognize the car when he was picked up by his girlfriend but didn't ask
where it came from. He was charged with armed trespassing within a 
conveyance - the stolen car.

Cain faces charges of grand theft auto, marijuana possession and child neglect.
