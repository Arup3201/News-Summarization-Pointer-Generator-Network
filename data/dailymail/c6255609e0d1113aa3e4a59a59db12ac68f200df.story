A production assistant on TV talk show The View was shot in the stomach during an angry stand-off in a New York deli yesterday - all because she took too long ordering her food.

Three armed thugs fired at Lourdes Guillen, 25, as she tried to protect her cousin, Juan Medina, 24 - who had already been shot twice.

Hosts from the TV show have praised Guillen, who still has a bullet lodged in her stomach, as a hero.

'This weekend, a member of our "View" family almost paid the ultimate price for her act of heroism,' said Whoopi Goldberg.

The incident took place at a 24 hour bodega in Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood at 5am on Sunday morning.

Miss
 Guillen, who works behind the scenes on the hit daytime show, had been 
celebrating Mr Medina's last day in the city with a third cousin, 
Ramali Rodriquez.

The men began hasseling the trio after deciding they were taking too much time ordering their food.

One
 began fighting with Mr Medina , who
 is visiting the city from his home in the Dominican Republic, and then 
pulled out a gun and opened fire - hitting him twice in the stomach.

Doctors at Manhattan's Bellevue 
hospital say she is in stable condition, her cousin, Mr Medina is in 
critical condition after undergoing a four hour operation.

View panelist Barbara Walters said she had spoken to
 Guillen this morning and that Guillen had told her that would step in front of her cousin again.

'Lourdes bravely stepped between them 
and pleaded with the gunman to stop the violence. He responded by 
shooting her in the stomach,' Walters said.

Elisabeth Hasselbeck added that 
Guillen had applied pressure to her cousin’s wounds and said she believe
 Guillen’s decision to put herself in the line of fire ‘saved both their lives.’

Miss Guillen pleaded with the shooter to stop, later telling the New York Post: 'I knew that if my cousin got shot again, he would die. I couldn’t let that happen. I had to do something.

'I was trying to talk him out of it, because if he saw I was a woman, he would stop. But clearly, that didn’t faze him at all.'

She claimed the man refused and told her: 'Don’t think I won’t shoot you too, b***h!' before firing at her once, striking her in the abdomen.

Miss Guillen added: 'I fell down against a car next to my cousin. 'I wasn’t 
bleeding. It wasn’t painful. It was just obstructing my breathing.

'We held hands and hung in there until the ambulance came.'

The police are investigating the shooting.
