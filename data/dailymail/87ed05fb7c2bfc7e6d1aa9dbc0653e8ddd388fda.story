Exactly a century after it became the first ship to be sunk by a U-Boat torpedo, the HMS Pathfinder has been marked with a wreath at its underwater resting place.

Divers swum 220 feet (68 metres) down off Scotland's east coast to commemorate the anniversary - filming the touching event on a GoPro camera.

They made their way through the murky waters off St Abb's Head, before coming across the rusted remains of the once great warship.

The unorthodox ceremony was commissioned by the Royal Navy, and was dedicated to the 250 crew members who lost their lives on the boat during World War I.

It was initially thought that the HMS Pathfinder had been blown up by a mine - but was later confirmed to be a torpedo from a U-Boat commanded by Otto Hersing.

Hersing went on to become one of the Germans' most successful U-Boat commanders, earning himself the nickname 'Zerstörer der Schlachtschiffe' - or 'Destroyer of Battleships'.

There were just 18 known survivors - including the captain - Lieutenant Commander Francis Martin Leake, who escaped wounded. 

Lieutenant Edward Oliver Stallybrass (then Sonnenschein) also survived the sinking, and recounted: 'The ship gave a heavy lurch forward and took an angle of about forty degrees down by the bow.

'Water came swirling up to the searchlight platform.

'The Captain said: "Jump you devils jump!"

'The Captain and his secretary remained with the ship until the very end but somehow both survived'

The ship was struck on the starboard side under the bridge from 1,500 yards (1,372 metres) while patrolling waters off southern Scotland. The forward magazine exploded, the bows were blown off and it sank in around four minutes. 

Author Aldous Huxley, who wrote the English classic 'Brave New World', actually witnessed the moment the ship was struck.

He said in a letter to his father: 'There was not a piece of wood, they said, big enough to float a man - and over acres the sea was covered with fragments - human and otherwise.

'They brought back a sailor's cap with half a man's head inside it.'

The wreath was presented to the team of British Sub-Aqua Club divers by Paul Ratcliff - a 74-year-old from Canterbury who lost his uncle in the disaster.

Bill Austin never met his nephew, as he was just 19 when he was killed on board the ship, but Mr Ratcliff was especially keen to honour him, as his body was never recovered and he has no grave.

Because of difficulty travelling, his grandparents were unable to make it up to Scotland to remember their son, so when he heard about the commemorative dive he requested that the wreath be placed. 

A plaque was also laid over the wreckage site by the Stern family, to remember William Stern - a stoker who died on board the Pathfinder.  

Despite the sinking being plainly visible from the shore, British authorities tried to cover it up, and claimed the ship was destroyed by a mine.

However, The Scotsman published the report of a fisherman who helped with the rescue, revealing the truth that the boat was  shot down.

The HMS Pathfinder was a 385-foot (117-metre) long Pathfinder-class scout cruiser. It had a top speed of 25 knots and had 15 guns and two torpedo tubes.

The Germans ran the U-Boat campaign throughout World War I, and used the submarines to attack the Allies' trade routes.

They mostly attacked around  Britain and the Mediterranean, and destroyed almost 5,000 ships in total.

The campaign started in the North Sea, when 10 submarines were sent from Heligoland to attack Royal Navy ships. However, it was unsuccessful - only one torpedo was fired and it missed its intended target - HMS Monarch. Meanwhile, two of the U-Boats were lost.

The U-Boats had much more success when their attentions were turned to the war on commerce. Britain had already managed to block off Germany with its Navy, not even allowing food to enter the country, and since the Germans' main navy was much weaker than the British, they fought back using U-Boats.

Admiral Hugo Von Pohl, commander of the German High Seas Fleet, declared the British and Irish seas a war zone, and the Germans send out 20 boats to form a naval blockade. They sunk a huge amount of trade boats heading into Britain.

In 1917, the Germans came up with the tactic of trying to 600,000 tons of shipping heading into Britain each month - they believed this would force their enemies to try for peace within six months. This was a huge success - 860,000 tons were sunk in April of that year alone, the British were left with just six weeks-worth of wheat, and the Americans were forced to declare war.

Towards the end of the war, the Allies had become far better at countering the threat of U-Boats. They used planes to patrol the seas - forcing them to go below the surface, where they were blind. The North Sea Mine Barrage then followed - when 70,000 mines were lain and destroyed six U-Boats between September and November 1918.

Upon the German surrender, the Allies insisted all U-Boats were also surrendered to them. Their last act was to suppress the German naval mutiny in October 1918 - revolt by sailors of the German High Seas Fleet. 

In total, U-Boats sunk almost 13 million gross tons of Allies' shipping. Of the 351 boats, 178 were lost in combat, with 5,000 people killed on board them.
