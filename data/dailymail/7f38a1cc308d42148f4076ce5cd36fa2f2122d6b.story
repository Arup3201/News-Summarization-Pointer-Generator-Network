THESE shocking images of Louis Cole picking up his live pet goldfish and eating it have sparked an investigation by the RSPCA.

The 28-year-old former youth worker is now being investigated for animal cruelty - which carries a maximum term of six months in jail - after posting the video online.

In the YouTube video Mr Cole laughs as he looks into the camera, saying he is going to 'eat his pet goldfish'.

He then grabs the four-inch long fish from its bowl as it struggles to get free before putting it into his mouth and biting.

During the video viewers even hear the crunch of the goldfish and see its tail flicking desperately from side to side.

Mr Cole gags several times as he struggles to eat the fish, but after glugging from a glass of water and swallowing the remains of the creature.

He said: 'That was really, really bitter - the most bitter thing I've ever eaten.'

More than 120,000 people have watched the video on YouTube after it was posted online a fortnight ago.

The RSPCA has confirmed that it has now launched an investigation and that Mr Cole could face court if it decided to prosecute.

Among the other videos posted online by Mr Cole - who prides himself of being to eat almost anything - include him eating a live tarantula, scorpion and crayfish.

He is also shown blending 10 dead mice into a paste and downing the liquid, eating a Turkey leg infested with maggots and swallowing a dead duckling from its egg.

The RSCA previously condemned Mr Cole's actions, but as all the animals he ate before the goldfish were invertebrates he was not breaking the law.

Bitter: After finally clamping down his jaw and chewing the goldfish he said it was the bitterest thing he had ever eaten

A goldfish, however, is a vertebrate and the maximum sentence for cruelty to animals is a fine of Â£20,000 or six months in prison.

The RSPCA said in a letter to Mr Cole that he is being investigated for causing unnecessary suffering to an animal under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.

It said he was also being investigated for breaching the duty of a person responsible for an animal to ensure its welfare.

Trouble: An RSPCA note warning he was in trouble was posted on Louis Cole's Facebook account

A letter was sent to Mr Cole, who lives in Roehampton, south west London, on Thursday. He then posted it on Facebook.

It
said: 'The RSPCA need to interview you regarding an allegation that you
may have committed a criminal offence contrary to section 9 & 4 of 
the Animal Welfare Act 2006.

'If
we cannot speak to you on a voluntary basis, you give us no other 
choice than to request the police arrest you in order to interview you.

'If
I do not hear from either you or your solicitor in the next few days I 
will contact the local police who will attend your address to arrest 
you.'

Commenting on the letter on Facebook Mr Cole said he was in 'serious trouble' and asked friends to give him advice.

Some
viewers who watched the video were disgusted at the at the demise of 
the goldfish.

One wrote: 'I've had to put this on mute; 
to watch and cover my eyes also because I think I would be physically 
sick if I heard any crunching.

'I
eat meat yes but things that are already dead not alive. So it makes me
feel slightly better about what I am eating and not as cruel - but this
vile.'

Attention: Another video watched by 150,000 people on YouTube Louis Cole can be seen eating raw eyeballs

Speaking recently Mr Cole said he was not a 'cruel person', adding: 'I don't want to inflict any pain on these animals, which is why I try to kill them instantly.'

He admitted, however, that lots of his friends think he's an attention grabber who enjoys 'riling people up a bit'.

The RSPCA have previously described Mr Cole's antics as being 'gratuitously cruel' to animals.

A spokeswoman said: 'The RSPCA is investigating after footage of a man
swallowing a goldfish was posted on YouTube.

'As our enquiries are ongoing we cannot give further details at this
stage.'
