An airman who survived four plane crashes during World War II is celebrating 70 years of marriage today. 

RAF bomber navigator Jim Stafford, 96, 
said it was the thought of returning home to his wife Betty, 95, that kept him going during the dangerous missions. 

Mrs Stafford said: 'Love got us through.'

Mr Stafford, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, said: 'Not many people can say they've done that in their lives.'

The airman joined up as a warrant officer in 1940, just months after war erupted in September 1939.

He survived four plane crashes throughout the Middle East and South Africa during the six-year conflict as well as another one shortly before he left the air force in 1946.

A hydraulic fault caused one crash while another three were the result of the wheels failing to deploy, causing crash landings.

Neither Mr Stafford or his crew were seriously injured in any of the crashes.

Of the fifth crash, that happened shortly after the war ended, Mr Stafford said: 'We were in Cumberland and were told to fly to Omagh in Northern Ireland and back again as part of a training exercise.

'But when we came back they told us to go back the other way around.

'We were just coming home when we ran out of petrol and had to crash land in the Lake District.'

Mr Stafford was a RAF serviceman based in Kent when he met his wife at Welling Gospel Chapel in 1942.

Mrs Stafford, who now lives with her husband at a care home in Felixstowe, said: 'That was when we saw each other for the first time properly, and I guess we both quite liked what we saw.'

The couple were married in 1943 when Mr Stafford persuaded his superiors to give him two weeks leave.

After the war they moved to 
Felixstowe and Mr Stafford worked as a teacher and also served as a 
Methodist preacher until he was 90.

Mrs
Stafford worked for Favor Parker and Felixstowe Dock and Railway 
Company before supporting Jim's preaching assignments across Suffolk as a
piano soloist.

They have a son, Malcolm, and a daughter Veronica, as well as six grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
