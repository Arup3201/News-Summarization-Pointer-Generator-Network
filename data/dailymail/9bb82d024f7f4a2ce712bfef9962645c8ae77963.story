With his ribs clearly visible and without a spare ounce on his body, Michael Buerk has lost a startling amount of weight in just ten days in the jungle.

But despite his gaunt appearance and complaints over the lack of food, the BBC veteran will not be the third contestant to quit I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!, according to his wife.

However, Christine Buerk, admitted she is ‘quite concerned’ for her husband because of his plummeting weight and is ‘horrified’ by the small amount of food his is having to survive on in the camp.

Viewers have also noticed his increasingly frail frame and have expressed their concern on Twitter, one posted: ‘I think there is a strong possibility Michael Buerk may actually completely disappear in #ImACeleb he’s that thin already.’ 

While another added: ‘Michael Buerk is so thin it’s slightly distressing. If he’s there at the end I dread to think what he’ll look like’.

The journalist himself has admitted he is struggling with his hunger, confessing to audiences he would, ‘give my right arm, my left arm, maybe both legs [for food].’

And speaking yesterday, Mrs Buerk said: ‘I was quite concerned [about his weight loss]. He was quite slim when he arrived. I was trying to encourage him to build up before coming out here, which he didn’t do. 

'He’s not got a lot of spare flesh on him, but he’s in good shape. I think it’s far, far healthier to be a little bit underweight that overweight.

‘I was quite horrified to realise that they only get 500 calories a day in the jungle. It’s not that he dislikes rice and beans, but the rations are quite low.’

Christine Buerk, admitted she is ‘quite concerned’ for her husband because of his plummeting weight and is ‘horrified’ by the small amount of food his is having to survive on. However, she said that he would not quit 

She added this lack of food could explain his often glum expression, commenting: ‘With only 500 calories a day, they haven’t got enough energy to smile as well.’

She thinks he will feel his thin frame even more keenly as he tries to find a comfy perch in the jungle. 

She said: ‘He’s got no flesh on his backside at all now. He always did have quite a neat little bum. Now, he’s starting to feel it’.

The contestants on I’m A Celebrity… subsist mainly on a diet of rice and beans, winning meals for the camp by completing Bushtucker Trials, often involving eating unappetising dishes such as cockroaches or kangaroo penis.

Buerk’s tribulations have fuelled speculation he might follow in the footsteps of reality star Gemma Collins and actor Craig Charles, who have already pull out of this series of the hit ITV show. 

However, he wife was keen to assure viewers this would not be the case.

She said: ‘Michael isn’t a quitter. I don’t see him walking out. He’s been in worse places. He’s been shot at, he’s been gassed, he’s been blown up in an ammunition dump explosion, he’s seen a sound guy die, he’s seen a cameraman lose his arm. 

'He’s been in real reality situations that have been very tough. I would be really, really surprised if he broke.’

Despite describing her husband as ‘my pin-up’, Mrs Buerk has been ‘amused’ by tweets from viewers telling him to ‘get your top back on’. 

She said this is different from when he was in his prime as a reporter and newsreader, when he earned a loyal and loving following.

She said: ‘When Michael was presenting the news, it was a big audience.

'It’s not like today when audiences are much more fragmented. When you’re presenting the news like he did, you become very important to lonely people. 

'There’s a reliable face coming into the living room every night. He’s definitely had a few nice letters over the years.’

However, even given his three decade career at the BBC, where he became accustomed to reporting from the grim conditions of El Salvador and apartheid South Africa, Buerk will still find the rigours of the jungle a shock, according to his wife.

She said: ‘I know he would say El Salvador is the toughest place he’s ever been to. It was a very, very frightening place where you’re not sure whether you’re going to get killed any minute. Paces where there are lots of guns and they’ve got into the hands of drugged-up kids. 

'He’s been to a lot of scary places. It’s a different type of scary to the jungle. He’s been very lucky that he hasn’t had to do any of the eating trials yet. I don’t know how he’d get on with eating something wriggling, but I think he’s certainly faced tougher situations’.

No matter how dire the situation, Buerk – who opened up this week about his regrets over never asking his mother about his bigamist father – can always turn to his campmates for support and his bond with chart-topping rap star Tinchy Stryder, 28, has been one of the surprising highlights of the series.

Talking previously about their relationship, Buerk said: ‘We get on well because we are complete opposites. 

'He is young and hip and edgy. He is a really interesting guy. I am at least two or maybe even three generations separated from him. I am stuffy, stuck up, middle class and middle aged. And white, of course. Opposites attract.’

And commenting yesterday, he wife said: ‘I think it’s great, although he’s practically old enough to be Tinchy’s grandfather! 

'The show opened up with Michael on his own and then Tinchy was the next person to arrive. Whether their bonding sprang from that original meeting, I don’t know.’

The journalist was given a private rap lesson by Stryder, whose verdict on Buerk was, ‘a cool dude, he’s so uncool that he’s cool.’
