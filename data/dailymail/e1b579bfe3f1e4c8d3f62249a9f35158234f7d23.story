The top ten most memorable 'maritime moments' in the past 500 years have been revealed, and they include everything from Olympic triumphs and historic voyages to sizzling silver screen scenes.

Sir Steve Redgrave's Olympic achievement of five consecutive gold medals for rowing between 1984 and 2000 was voted the most iconic British 'on the water' occasion.

While the list includes a number of important voyages and maritime events, a few less historically significant - but no less memorable - moments were chosen by the 1,000 Britons polled by PSP Southampton Boat Show.
