Former child actor and Young Talent Time star Debra Byrne has come forward with new claims she was abused on set as a teenager and has posted a plea for witnesses to contact her on Facebook.

Byrne, 57, named two of her alleged abusers and described being assaulted in a swimming pool during the filming of 1972 film Caravan Holiday.

'After a day's filming we the YTT and crew were swimming in a pool. I don't recall where the pool was but while I was in the pool [name withheld] swam up to me and digitally raped me,' she wrote in the post, which has since been deleted.

Byrne posted a plea for witnesses to alleged abuse she suffered on set to come forward on Facebook, but has since deleted the post

'I was a very disturbed girl and was abused I believe because I was considered fair game.'

Byrne – who would have been about 15 years old at the time - also referenced another incident which she alleged took place while she and Young Talent Time star Johnny Young were filming a Red Tulip Chocolates commercial.

'There were more than two people in the studio. If this jogs anyone's memory and you are comfortable to speak with me about what took place in the studio please contact me,' she posted.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Byrne for comment.

Debra Byrne has launched an appeal on Facebook for witnesses to come forward over an alleged incident in 1972

Speaking on behalf of her father, Young's daughter Anna said Byrne should report the incidents to police, news.com.au reported.

'He would like her to go to the police, if she feels so strongly about it, rather than put it on Facebook,' Ms Young said.

'He feels if any woman has been wronged in any way — he's very protective — go to the police, don't put it on Facebook.

'We wish her all the best, if she does feel there is something that happened to her I agree with my dad, she really needs to go to the police.'

Entertainment reporter Peter Ford, who spoke to Young on Sunday night, said Young denied knowing any alleged abuse was taking place.

'The suggestion with Deb often seems to be that Johnny Young knew what was going on and didn't do anything,' Mr Ford to radio 3AW.

'Johnny is adamant he didn't know anything. He certainly wouldn't have allowed it.'

In 2006 Byrne, a mother of three, released her memoir Not Quite Ripe in which she detailed her troubled childhood and teenage years - including the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her maternal grandfather and her battles with drug addiction and depression.

Byrne, who starred on Young Talent Time between the ages of 12 and 16, also detailed an ongoing sexual relationship she had as a 13 year old with a crew member who was more than 10 years older than her. He was charged with statutory rape.

Byrne, who grew up in a religious family but left the church in her early teens, has since returned to Christianity.

She has had a long, successful career as an actress and pop singer, appearing in TV shows including The Secret Life of Us, Home and Away and most recently Fat Tony & Co on Channel 9.
