A father has told a court he was only doing his duty as a Muslim by handing out leaflets calling for gay people to be executed.

Kabir
Ahmed, 28, said he handed a leaflet called Death Penalty? to a 
policeman and stuffed them through letterboxes across Derby because he 
was spreading the word of God as taught by Islam.

He
said: 'My intention was to do my duty as a Muslim, to inform people of 
God’s word and to give the message on what God says about 
homosexuality.'

Accused: Kabir Ahmed, left, and Umar Javed, 
right, are on trial along with three other men accused of stirring up 
hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation

Married
Ahmed, who has a nine-month-old daughter, is on trial with four other 
men at Derby Crown Court charged with inciting hatred on the grounds of 
sexual orientation, the first prosecution of its kind since legislation 
came into force in March 2010.

At
the opening of the trial last week jurors were shown the Death Penalty?
leaflet, which shows an image of a mannequin hanging from a noose and 
says that homosexuality is punishable by the death penalty under Islam.

The
leaflet states: 'The death sentence is the only way this immoral crime 
can be erased from corrupting society and act as a deterrent for any 
other ill person who is remotely inclined in this bent way.'

In the dock: Mehboob Hussain, left, Razwan Javed, and Ihjaz Ali, right, all arrive at Derby Crown Court

It
goes on: 'The only dispute amongst the classical authorities was the 
method employed in carrying out the penal code,' and then goes on to 
offer burning, being flung from a high point such as a mountain or 
building, or being stoned to death as suitable methods.

Giving
evidence today Ahmed, wearing a pair of grey trousers and a black 
shirt, said he had handed one of the Death Penalty? leaflets to PC 
Stephen Gregory on July 2 2010 as he was passing by the area of the 
Jamia Mosque in Rosehill Street following Friday prayers.

He
told the court he felt it was his duty as a Muslim to inform and advise
people wherever they may be committing sins, he would be failing if he 
did not.

On trial: The five defendants are alleged to have handed out one homophobic document outside the Jamia Mosque in Derby

'My duty is not just to better myself but to try and better the society I live in,' he said.

'We
believe we can’t just stand by and watch somebody commit a sin, we must
try and advise them and urge them to stay away from sin.'

Ahmed
said he had studied the texts of many religions including the Bible and
the Torah and used ideas from each to compare with what Islam says 
about things such as drugs, alcohol, prostitution and relationships.

Ahmed’s
barrister Zacharias Miah asked him if PC Gregory had told him he was 
doing something wrong would he have handed over the bag of leaflets he 
was carrying and Ahmed replied: 'Of course, without a shadow of a 
doubt.'

Prosecutor Bobbie 
Cheema told the court the Death Penalty? leaflet was not educational or 
informative but was simply 'threatening, offensive, frightening and 
nasty.'

Four other Derby men
- Ihjaz Ali, 42, Mehboob Hussain, 45, Umar Javed, 38, and his brother 
Razwan Javed, 28, of Wilfred Street - are also charged with the same 
offence.

All five men deny the charges.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
