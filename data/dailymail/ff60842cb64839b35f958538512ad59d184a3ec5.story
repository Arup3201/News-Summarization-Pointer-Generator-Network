A pensioner just weeks from her 70th birthday is a real high flyer... but we're not talking about her career.

At the age of 69 Gill Williams, from Cardiff, has long since retired from her job in financial services.

These days the pensioner likes nothing better than swinging from a trapeze at circus school.

While many elderly people wouldn't dream of such daring exploits for fear of the physical demands required, Gill is something of an anomaly - and that's just the way she likes it.

She attends circus skills classes at the HQ of world-renowned Cardiff-based NoFit State Circus twice a week.

'I started circus skills and aerial work, which is my favourite, just before turning 50,' she recalls.

'I saw an advert in Eastern Leisure Centre for a trapeze class run by No Fit State who had been going for about eight years by then.

'It was a class for children, so I called and said, "I'm a 50-year-old adult".

'There was a sharp intake of breath on the other end of the line, but the instructor said there were only 14 spaces, so we should wait and see if all the spaces got taken up.'

As luck would have it, Gill received a call to partake in the class - and when she arrived the only other adults there were parents ready to watch their children pick up circus tricks.

'I squatted on the floor with the other children and the instructor said, "I wondered if you were going to look like an old granny". Coming from anyone else, that would have been rude, but it was so funny.

'It was a very hard class, but such fun. Exercising with young people was and is still very liberating.'

Hanging upside down from ropes might not be every pensioner's idea of fun, however Gill's agility has come as no surprise to her friends and family.

She took up rollerblading at 55 and there are plenty of other adventures she would like to have a go at before she thinks of winding down.

Her husband Cliff - with whom she celebrated 50 years of marriage this year - gets a similar thrill from surfing and windsurfing.

As a child growing up in the Rhondda Valley, Gill longed to do gymnastics, but didn't have much opportunity to partake in her passions - instead she took piano lessons at the insistence of her father.

However, it was when she hit 40 that her life took a turn.

An article about cancer patients had a profound emotional impact and made Gill realise it was time she started looking after herself, taking care of her body and fitness.

Now retired, Gill, who begins her eighth century in November, regularly goes to the gym - when she's not flying on a trapeze of course.

She has also practised yoga for years and with regular swimming and running, exercises up to five times a week.

And for the future? Well she's going to keep on keeping on. To this inspirational woman, age really is just a number.

'Many people think that just because they're getting old that should stop them from exercising. I'm proof that if you look after yourself, you can achieve whatever you want.'
