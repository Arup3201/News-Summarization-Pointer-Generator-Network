Bruno Xavier may not be a household name to most but in the world of Beach Soccer he is a legend and here he proves why.Â 

The World Cup is just weeks away but Xavier has already started the party with an incredible goal in a recent match against Germany.

After exchanging passes with a team-mate Xavier received the ball in the air and then didn't let it bounce as he proceeded to knock it over two members of the opposition and then the goalkeeper.

Touch: Xavier took the ball from a team-mate and it didn't drop from that point

Grounded: Opposition defenders were left on the floor by Xavier

Xavier, 29, plays for Corinthians in Brazil and is widely considered to be the best Beach Soccer player in the world right now.

At the 2013 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Xavier won the Golden Ball award and finished as the tournament's second highest scorer with 10 goals.

The video has quickly become an internet sensation and there are suggestions from those in Brazil that it should become part of the voting for the Puskas Award - which has never contained a Beach Soccer goal on the shortlist - at the end of the year.

Composure: After his run Xavier was cool enough to lift the ball over the keeper

Quality: Supporters were left mesmerised by what they had just seen
