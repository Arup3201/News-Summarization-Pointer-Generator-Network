Bobby Jindal took pot-shots at President Barack Obama – and at his own Republican party – on Thursday during a speech to a conservative family-valies group in Washington, D.C.

In his remarks to the American Principles Project, the anti-abortion, anti-gay marraige Louisiana governor blasted his fellow GOPers, without naming them, for being 'cheaper Democrats.'

Jindal is on a tear this year, castigating proponents of 'Common Core,' the Obama administration's plan to nationalize education standards and take control away from local governments. 

Some moderate Republicans, most notably former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have embraced the plan. Bush, now a 2016 front-runner, faces a difficult road ahead convincing social conservatives that he's right.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is road-testing a laundry list of rock-ribbed conservative positions in advance of deciding whether to run for president, but his passion is battling 'Common Core' federal education standards

'DEMOCRAT-LITE': Jindal bashed moderate Republicans with swipes that seemed aimed at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush

'Overreach of the federal government into every corner of our lives,' Jindal said Thursday to applause, also railing against the Obamacare insurance system and 'government elites.' 

'I have more faith in the moms than I do in any collection of bureaucrats,' he said. 'They think they know better than you. They think you're not smart enough to educate your children.' 

He could ride the Common Core issue far into the 2016 primary season, hitting Bush over the head with it at every turn.

But is he in the race?

'Look, we're thinking about it. We're taking a serious look at it,' Jindal told Daily Mail Online during a post-speech press conference in which Republicans and President Obama took turns as his punching bag.

'My wife and I are praying about it. We'll make that decision in the next couple of months.'

If he ran, he said, his campaign 'would be about standing up to the left.' 

Jindal reserved harsher words for Republicans, baiting them in a way that seemed to forehadow the 2016 presidential primary race.

American, he said, don't want 'for us to be cheaper, paler versions, weaker versions of the other party.'

'If all we are is cheaper Democrats, if all we are are Democrat-lite, we don't deserve to be the governing party. We don't deserve to win the election. We don't deserve to have a majority in the Congress or the White House.'

'If this election was all about getting bigger and better office space for John Boehner and for Senator Mitch McConnell, let's give the office space back,' he blasted.

NO COMPROMISE: Jindal insists that Americans will vote for an 'authentic' conservative

'GRAHAMNESTY': South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham would attract slings and arrows from Jindal if he entered the 2016 White House contest because of his Obama-esque views on immigration

Jindal drew lines of comparison between the Democratic Party and some Republicans who have softened their opposition to the Affordable Care Act over time.

'You need to repeal and replace the entire thing (but) that's not what many Republicans are saying here in Washington, D.C.' he said. 

'They say, "Oh ,no, there's a new baseline. That means that if we just replace some of the taxes, or some of the spending, that's progress".'

'That's nonsense,' Jindal nearly barked in mid-crescendo. 'When they were campaigning, they talked about repealing and replacing all of Obamacare.'

Jindal favors scrapping the system and replacing it with standardized income tax deductions that would permit Americans to spend money on whatever insurance plan they chose, and would possibly lower prices across the board by letting Americans buy policies issued in any of the 49 states where they don't live.

Democrats have opposed those measures since the 1990s days of HillaryCare, am even more sweeping overhaul than Obamacare, which was proposed by then-first lady Hillary Clinton. 

OBAMASCARE: Jindal says Republicans who ran with promises that they would repeal the Affordable Care Act need to follow through, lest they become a 'second liberal party'

'I think we've had enough of on-the-job training with our current president,' Jindal said of Barack Obama

Jindal fears that the Affordable Care Act will calcify in place, and that the GOP will go along – virtually erasing the policy differences between Republicans and Democrats.

'We don't need two liberal parties,' he told Daily Mail Online during a Q&A..

'We have $18 trillion of debt. We have Obamacare interfering with the relationships between patients and doctors. We've got a middle class suffering in his economy,' Jindal exclaimed. 

'We need in the Republican party leaders who have the courage, the honesty to tell us the truth, to stand up to the left.'

'I think we've had enough of on-the-job training with our current president,' he said later. 'Let's elect someone who's actually balanced a budget and run a state government.'

That's a massive hint that he has a bias toward governors, rather than members of the U.S. Senate, winning the White House.

'The advantage of having a governor is that they've got a track record,' Jindal said, analyzing Gov. Bush's chances next year. 'They've had to govern with results,' Jindal said.

'This president,' on the other hand, 'gave some good speeches, and that's all he's given.'
