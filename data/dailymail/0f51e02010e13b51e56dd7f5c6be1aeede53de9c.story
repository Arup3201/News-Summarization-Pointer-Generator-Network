Former Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson stood to profit from Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB takeover through shares he held in News Corporation, it had been claimed.

Mr Coulson is understood to have been awarded the stock in the U.S. company when he resigned as News of the World editor in 2007 over phone hacking claims.

He went on to become Downing Street Communications Director with close links to Mr Cameron, who would later become the Prime Minister overseeing the deal. Mr Cameron has previously admitted that he and Mr Coulson were 'close friends'.

The revelation could cause further damage to Mr Cameron as Mr Coulson prepares to give evidence to the Leveson Inquiry this Thursday. Former News International boss Rebekah Brooks will give evidence on Friday.

Difficult week: Correspondence between the Prime Minister David Cameron with Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson could be revealed this week

According to the Independent on 
Sunday, Mr Coulson was given the shares when he resigned as editor of 
News of the World over the phone hacking scandal in 2007.

As a special advisor and civil servant Mr Coulson would had to have declared the holdings when he joined Downing Street in 2010.

In the run-up to the anticipated acquisition of BSkyB the share price of News Corp soared to almost $19.

But after it emerged that News of the 
World staff had hacked the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler the
share price plummeted to around $14 - wiping tens of millions of 
dollars off the value of the firm.

Any shares that Mr Coulson held would have also been affected by the loss.

A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: 'On appointment, Andy Coulson complied with recruitment processes, including declaration of any interests to the Cabinet Office.'

The revelation came as it emerged that
David Cameron’s aides will pore over his text messages to Mrs Brooks 
this week amid fears he will be embarrassed by fresh details about his 
links to the Murdoch empire.

The
Prime Minister, with his lawyers and special advisers, have set up a 
unit to study the texts to the former News of the World editor to search
for ‘landmines’.

No 10 is 
braced for a difficult week as Mrs Brooks and Mr Coulson will both be 
giving evidence to Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into press standards.

It has been 
claimed that Mr Cameron was so close to Mrs Brooks that he texted her up
to a dozen times a day – and that Mrs Brooks has kept all the 
communications.

Mr 
Cameron and Mrs Brooks are said to sign-off some of their text messages 
to intimate friends with the friendly ‘x’ preferred by many habitual 
phone texters.

If they did so in messages to each other, it could add to the Government’s growing discomfort over the Leveson disclosures.

According
to some sources, Mr Cameron sent text messages of support to Mrs Brooks
and her husband, race-horse trainer Charlie Brooks, before she was 
forced to resign over the phone-hacking affair.

Mrs
Brooks is expected to be asked about her relations with politicians and
senior police officers when she appears before Lord Leveson on Friday.

She
could also be pressed over Mr Cameron’s admission that he had ridden a 
horse loaned to Mrs Brooks by the Metropolitan Police.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt is facing questions about the nature of his relationship with the Murdoch empire

The inquiry’s 
lawyers will not be able  to question Brooks or Coulson about anything 
that could prejudice the continuing police investigation into phone 
hacking. Both have been arrested and bailed.

Mr
Cameron and seven other Cabinet Ministers will be given advance sight 
of witness statements from Mrs Brooks and Mr Coulson after successfully 
winning ‘core participant’ status at an emergency hearing on Friday.

The ministers are David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Vince Cable, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Theresa May, Ken Clarke and George Osborne.

This latest worry for the Prime Minister comes hot on the heels of the Jeremy Hunt scandal.

According to The Independent on Sunday, David Cameron agreed to a meeting with one of Rupert Murdoch' senior executives, that was arranged by the lobbyist now at the centre of the scandal.

Jeremy Hunt's culture secretary has already had to step down over emails sent from the same senior executive Frederic Michel about a BSkyB contract he was overseeing at the time.

Mr Michel set up the meet in 2009 between the Prime Minister and Jose Maria Aznar, the former Prime Minister of Spain, and a member of New Corporation's board.

His involvement in the meeting - that came just weeks after The Sun switched its support from Labour to Conservatives - brings into doubts claims by Mr Hunt and that Prime Minister that he is just a lobbyist.

The meeting further demonstrates the Prime Minster's close relationship with the Murdochs and members of their organisations.

But a Number 10 spokesman told the newspaper: 'All contact with News International and News Corp has been declared in the correct way. The Prime Minister has had no inappropriate discussions about the BSkyB bid either as Prime Minister or before.'
