A six-year-girl is stunning audiences around the world with her amazing breakdancing skills that dancers many years older than her would struggle to accomplish.

Dachiya Atkinson, who performs under the stage alias of B-Girl Terra, became a worldwide internet sensation earlier this year when footage of her performing at a competition in Paris received a staggering 2.8 million within five days.

Since then she has stunned audiences on The Ellen Show and has now appeared in a video for a track called ‘Platoon’ by the British dance act Jungle.

The music video consists entirely of B-Girl Terra dancing along to the song in a single take showing off a series of mind blowing moves that would be complicated for a young adult, never mind a six-year-old schoolgirl from Wolverhampton in England.

At one stage in the video B-Girl Terra rolls back her sleeves, puts on an awesome pink beanie hat and starts doing some very impressive head spins.

The video has been posted on numerous social media sites, including YouTube where it has been watched more than 100,000 times

Breakdancing or b-boying as it is also known is one of the five elements that make up hip hop culture along with the likes of rapping, DJing and graffiti art.

Back in March the pint-sized performer competed in the Baby Battle division of the Chelles Battle Pro competition held in an Eastern suburb of Paris, France.

She wowed the judges with a breathtaking routine which had the crowd on their feet and quickly attracted a staggering 2.8 million within five days of being uploaded of the internet. She eventually won an award for Best Dancer in her age range.

Her parents have revealed how the youngster had not only learned to walk by the age of nine months - but was doing handstands at just two years old. And by the time Dachiya was three she was spinning on her head like a pro.

Her mother Jennifer Hollyoak, 27, said: ‘She's always been quite confident and bouncy - she has loved dancing from a very young age.

‘Apart from this insane natural talent for break-dancing she is just a normal little girl - she likes dolls and playing with her toys.

‘I was worried she was going to get scared as she is only six, but she is still really happy when she comes off stage, even if she loses.

‘That is the important thing. She is very confident, and we are so proud. We can't quite believe how the video of her has taken off.

‘We were clicking on the clip and we were quite surprised when it got to 500,000 views, it was such a shock. Now three million people have seen it - it's unreal.

‘But she's just bothered about her friends and teachers at school seeing it. She loves the normal things like going to the cinema and playing with her friends.

‘I think because of her age the publicity hasn't hit her and she isn't aware of the buzz.’

Dachiya and her sister Damita currently train three times a week for a couple of hours each session and also do gymnastics

Dachiya's father Dean took her to dance classes when she was 18 months old. She soon mastered the art and is now part of London-based dance troupe Soul Mavericks - the biggest in the UK.

According to Dachiya her favorite dance move is the challenging headspin.

‘It feels really good when I'm dancing, I just love to be on the stage. My favorite move is the headspin, I find them easy to do now but it took a lot of practice,' she said.

‘I love dancing with my sister and all my friends think it's really good. In the future I'd like to be a world champion or be famous for dancing.’

Dachiya and her sister Damita currently train three times a week for a couple of hours each session and also do gymnastics.

Breakdancing developed as a street dance in the 1970s as part of hip hop culture among African and Latino American youths in New York City.

But it has spread across the globe and is popular in countries including South Korea, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and Japan.
