Now this is an odd one, Curious by name and curious by nature.

Rebecca Front is an actress you will know from a thousand comedy shows on TV: she was in The Day Today with Chris Morris and Steve Coogan, played a hapless politician in two series of The Thick Of It, and was Simon Amstell’s mother in Grandma’s House.

Last year, she was Mrs Bennet in Death Comes To Pemberley, and she has a nice recurring role in Lewis, as the grouchy boss every TV detective is obliged to have by law. It’s an impressive list of credits.

Funny old world: Actress Rebecca Front has just written her new autobiographical book 'Curious'

Like so many actors and actresses with brains and an excess of nervous energy, though, she writes as well. There have been Radio 4 shows and columns for The Guardian, and now there’s this book, a collection of autobiographical fragments that seeks to show us just how strange the world can be.

These are true stories, she says, ‘though perhaps a little bent out of shape in the telling’. One senses that she is aiming at the widest possible readership.

‘If you recognise something of yourself in here, then great. If, on the other hand, it just confirms that yours is the only sane voice in an otherwise bonkers world, then that’s fine too.’

So we hear of her grandmother, who like many of her generation had a sitting room that was kept for best: ‘Nobody went in it, because it was there for “visitors”, and no one who came to the house ever quite merited that description.’

Rebecca’s parents’ house, by contrast, was always a bit of a mess. Her grandmother spent a lot of time there, and when they had people round, she always insisted on helping them tidy up afterwards.

‘When the final cushion was plumped, the last crumb Hoovered up, Grandma would say with some pride: “There. It’s as if they had never been.”’ And that, Rebecca began to realise, was the point. For her grandmother, a tidy house was an end in itself.

‘As the years of her long life gathered behind her, she appeared to have come to the conclusion that the best way to keep her home fit for others to see, was never to allow anyone in to see it,’ Front writes.

There are tales of disastrous childhood holidays, of humiliation at university, of claustrophobia and panic attacks, and of her lifelong inability to swim.

She fears trains because of the tunnels. She fears planes because she doesn’t want to leave her children motherless.

She undergoes hypnotherapy to cure her phobias, but can’t relax enough to enter a trance. Even though she has taken a strong dislike to the hypnotherapist, sheer politeness compels her to pretend that the therapy has worked like a dream.

Like many of us, she suffers from the chronic disease of Englishness. I bet that when she eats a lousy meal in a restaurant, she doesn’t complain, she tells the waiter it’s delicious and silently vows never to  go back.

One of the best chapters is entitled Normal. ‘I’m the sort of person who is so preoccupied with appearing normal that I can’t buy four bottles of wine without remarking in a jaunty voice that they’re not all for me.’

Curious and curiouser: Front encounters a rabbit on the bus

On a bus she sees a woman with a rabbit on a lead. The woman seems perfectly relaxed about it, but other passengers look at her and her rabbit as though she’s not normal. All except for one woman, who pets the rabbit fondly.

But then she starts to stare at the rabbit, stare and stare and stare. The rabbit’s owner becomes uneasy. Does this person want to steal her rabbit? Does she want to cook it? Her body tenses and her face hardens.

‘Finally she did what all the other passengers had done to her: she turned her back and pretended the woman wasn’t there.’

Curious is full of such strange incidents, each of them reflected through the prism of Rebecca Front’s distinctive take on the world.

My first impression, though, was of a slight lack of focus. It’s as though the publishers wanted one sort of book — a straight-down-the-line autobiography would be my guess — and the writer wanted to try something more ambitious, more akin to the work of the American humorist David Sedaris.

The result isn’t quite either, and nor is it ‘a beguiling celebration of the curiosities of life’, as the blurb-writer has put it, possibly tearing his or her hair out with frustration.

Nonetheless, a theme does emerge from the book, and that’s anxiety. Rebecca, who admits she has become the Jewish mother she was always destined to be, has anxieties to burn, and writes amusingly and perceptively about them.

Only she, having inadvertently shoplifted a bulb of garlic, could go back to the supermarket a few  days later to pay for it, and then, having embarrassed herself utterly in conversation with the manager, walk out with a basket of goods she later realises she hadn’t paid for.

This isn’t curious, this is round the bend. And something close to normal life for a lot of us . . .
