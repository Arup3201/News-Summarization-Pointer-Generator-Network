The Carolina Panthers rained on the parade of the New Orleans Saints on Sunday with a last-minute win as loyal fans got drenched in a downpour.

It was a nail-biting finish as quarterback Cam Newton threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Domenik Hixon with 23 seconds left to lift the Panthers to a 17-13 win over the Saints and clinch the teamâ€™s first trip to the playoffs since 2008.

The game in Charlotte was hit with torrential rain but fans refused to exit the stands, leaving the stadium dotted with colorful ponchos.

Although most fans stuck out the terrible weather to see through the tense game, many who had failed to come prepared were forced to abandon beers and head home.

However the Panthers' cheerleaders the Topcats kept going through the deluge.

Coaching staff were delighted with the last-minute win as the Panthers head into the Superbowl playoffs for the first time since 2008.

'Cam was very resilient,' coach Ron Rivera said. 'He struggled all day and he knows that. But he came through when we needed him.'

The Saints (10-5) can still clinch a playoff berth on Sunday if Arizona loses to Seattle.

However it's not been easy for the Saints, having dropped five of their last six games away from the Superdome.
