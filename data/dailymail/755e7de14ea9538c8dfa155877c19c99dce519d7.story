This breathtaking footage of two wingsuit divers leaping from the top of a 4,600ft high mountain will blow you away.

Eager for the ultimate adrenalin rush, the daring duo decided to jump from the top of the Tianmen mountain in China, despite the extreme sport being banned at the risky location.

Captured using a GoPro camera, the footage shows the pair soaring alongside a four mile long cable line - the longest in the world.

Russian daredevils Gelb Vorevodin, purple suit, and Ratmir Nagimianov, blue suit, dive from the top of a 1,400 metre high Chinese mountain for the ultimate thrill

The pair plunge from the mountain into the valley below despite the fact Chinese authorities have outlawed the use of wingsuits from that location as it is so dangerous

As they continued their journey to the valley floor, the pair passed over the most amazing corkscrew roadway that edged along the side of the mountain

Incredibly, Russian divers, Ratmir Nagimianov, 29, and Gleb Vorevodin, 35, managed to get a mere 32ft away from the cable carts, giving Chinese tourists an unlikely surprise.

Reaching speeds of over 160mph, the wing-suiters were forced to make split second life or death decisions.

Mr Nagimianov said: 'The view was just amazing, it was great to see the tourist buses driving around the curves of the road.

He said: 'There is an aerial lift which you can take to get the top of the Tianmen mountain, we were aiming to fly as close the cable carts as possible.

'Because of the high and speed of the initial jump, it was incredibly difficult to line up with the cable carts.

'But on the second jump we got really close, I'd say we were about five metres away.

'We found out that jumps from this area are banned two days before our trip but it was too late to cancel so we knew we just had to go and try, we were constantly worried that someone would stop us from jumping.

'It was an incredible experience and even though it looks amazing on camera, it really doesn't do it justice.'

The special wingsuits allow daredevils to 'fly' further than they would if they were using a parachute, but once they approach the ground they pull the cord to land

On the way down the pair flew past the world's longest cable car which travels for an astonishing four miles from the mountain top to the valley floor

At one stage, the pair were just 10 metres away from the cable car, giving stunned Chinese tourists an unexpected photo opportunity

The wingsuit divers also buzzed cars and coaches driving on the mountain road while hurtling along the valley at speeds of up to 160 miles per hour

On the way down, the pair had to dodge high peaks jutting up from the valley floor which could have caused disaster

The pair performed two jumps even though they discovered two days beforehand that such activities had been banned

Mr Nagimianov said 'It was an incredible experience and even though it looks amazing on camera, it really doesn't do it justice'
