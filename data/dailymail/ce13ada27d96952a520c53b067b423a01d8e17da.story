From impersonating pets to naming pigs, some parts of the world have laws that may be considered barking mad by many people.

While dogs aren't allowed to attend the opera in Chicago, Illinois and pet lions can't go to the cinema in Baltimore, Maryland.

According to helpucover's graphic, in the UK, it is against the law to let a common pet mate with an animal from the royal household, such as one of the Queen's corgis.

In another animal welfare move, officials in Switzerland have decided that pets must have companions so they don’t get lonely, and owners must pass written and verbal tests to keep a dog.

For example, it's illegal to imitate an animal in Miami, Florida, while people in Oklahoma are forbidden from pulling faces at dogs.

They face a fine or even prison if they are caught offending man's best friend.

Humans aren't allowed to sleep in a dog kennel in Wallace, Idaho and can’t give whisky or a cigar to a dog in Illinois.

Meanwhile, pets are expected to behave properly too. For instance, dogs in Little Rock, Arkansas are banned from barking after 6pm.

Are legislators barking up the wrong tree? Dogs are denied an education and the chance of attending an opera in parts of the US, and humans are under fire too - it's illegal to impersonate a pet in Miami (pictured)
