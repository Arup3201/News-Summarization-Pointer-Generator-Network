A woman has denied child neglect after a baby fell from the first floor window of a block of flats.

Karen Sennett, 31, was arrested on August 5 after the child plunged from an open window of the flat in Rainham, Kent.

The 18-month-old struck an awning before hitting an elderly man who was walking past.

The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was rescued by a passer-by who tended to her until emergency services arrived, who treated her for cuts to her head and chest. 

An air ambulance was sent out but paramedics decided to take the baby to King's College Hospital, in London, by ambulance.

At the time she was said to have a 'potentially serious head injury', but was later released. 

A witness to the fall, who did not wish to be named, said in August: 'I saw the baby fall from the window, but at first I thought it was a doll, it hit an elderly man on the shoulder then fell to the floor.

'I went to see if the man was okay and the baby wasn't making any sound so I still thought it was a doll, but then she started screaming.

'I picked her up and cradled her. There was a big bump on her forehead that was getting bigger and bigger.

'She was bleeding from her nose and mouth.'

Sennett, from Rainham, pleaded not guilty at Medway Magistrates' Court and was bailed to appear at Maidstone Crown Court on November 14

Passer-by Becky Zacharow, 18, said: 'It was about 8.10am and I was on the way to the train station on the way to work.

'I turned the corner and saw an elderly man coming out the shop with his paper and some milk and then I just saw a white blur coming down.'

She added: 'She was just spinning.

'She just looked limp and she wasn’t making any noise.

'I went over and what I thought was this doll just started screaming and I realised it was a baby.

'I was holding her so that her head was in my shoulder and I could see that she was bleeding. 

'I put her in a cradle position. She grabbed some tissue and started wiping her face. When I was talking to her she was focusing on me.' 

Sennett, from Rainham, pleaded not guilty at Medway Magistrates' Court today.

She was bailed to appear at Maidstone Crown Court on November 14.
