Workers could save up to £1,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research shows.

More than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of £1,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals.

In comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just £552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping £1,288.

New research reveals that 62 per cent of Britons spend an average of £1,840 a year buying their lunch out, with supermarkets voted the top place to purchase it. Those who prepare lunch at home spend just £552

Tiredness and a lack of time were cited as the two main reasons why people bought lunch out instead of preparing it themselves at home to save money. Pictured: A Tesco BLT costs £2.20 while the soup is £2.35

The startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home.

Supermarkets were voted the top place to buy lunch – with 47 per cent choosing the giant retailers - ahead of company canteens and nearby restaurants.

When questioned, more than half (57 per cent) of those who purchased their lunch said they thought it was an expensive habit.

According to those surveyed, tiredness was cited as the main reason why people choose to buy lunch as opposed to preparing it in advance.

Other excuses included 'more choice at work' and a 'lack of time'.

Matthew Wood, director of vouchercloud.com, said: 'With increasingly busy lifestyles, it is understandable to see why people are choosing convenience over economy.

'It's very easy to slip into a routine of popping to the shop to grab a sandwich rather than planning your weekly or monthly shops to incorporate the components of a homemade lunch, then taking the time to prepare it on top.

'Obviously, there will be times where making your own lunch is just not feasible or even possible, however, when presented with these findings, I think those opting for convenience will be alarmed.

'With average annual savings close to £1,300, it seems bonkers not to try and get into a routine of making your own, even if this is just a few days a week.

'Think of what the surplus could be spent on instead. It could even equate to an extra holiday.'

While many spend up to £5 a day on lunch, huge savings can be made by buying the ingredients and making them at home. A pack of Tesco Everyday Unsmoked Streaky Bacom costs just £1.04 for a dozen rashers

A loaf of Tesco sliced bread (pictured) costs just 45p and will make sandwiches for the entire working week

A six-pack of salad tomatoes at Tesco cost 69p, while a lettuce costs 49p. It means the above ingredients could make about five BLT sandwiches, meaning each lunch costs a fraction of the shop-bought version

MailOnline found that hefty savings could be made by preparing lunch at home ahead of the week, instead of buying on-the-run.

A Bacon, Lettuce & Tomato Sandwich from Tesco costs £2.20, which adds up to £11 if buying one every working day for a week.

In comparison, a homemade version of the same sandwich costs just 53p to make.

A packet of Tesco Everyday Value Streaky Bacon costs £1.04 for 275g, while a six-pack of tomatoes is 69p and a lettuce is 49p.

A loaf of Tesco Everyday Value Bread is 45p, meaning the entire ingredients of the sandwich costs a total of £2.67. The ingredients could make about five sandwiches, meaning each lunch costs a fraction of the price of the shop-bought version.

Elsewhere, huge savings can be made on homemade soups.

While a New Covent Garden Vegetable Soup costs £2.35 for 700g from Tesco, a homemade vegetable soup can cost less than 90p per portion.

A Tesco Tuna Pasta Tomato Salad costs £2 (above), but a homemade version can be made for half the price

Tesco Everyday Value Tuna Chunks cost 74p for a tin containing 160g, and could serve up to two portions

Tesco Everyday Value Penne pasta costs 30p (500G), and would create at least two portions of a pasta salad, with some leftover. Own brand tomato puree can be picked up from the supermarket for just 40p (right)

Carrots can be bought from the supermarket for 53p (for 1kg), potatoes for £1.18 (for 2kg), parsnips for 85p (for 500g), a swede for 70p and an onion for 16p. Tesco Everyday Vegetable Stock Cubes, to help thicken and add flavour to the soup, can be purchased for just 20p for 10.

In total, the ingredients amount to £3.62, but they make a hearty bulk which could serve at least four portions. It means the actual portion cost is just 90p.

Similar savings can be made on a homemade tuna pasta salad. While a pre-packed Tesco Healthy Living Tuna Pasta Tomato Salad costs £2, a homemade version can be made for half the price.

Tesco Everyday Value Tuna Chunks cost 74p for a tin containing 160g, while Tesco Everyday Value Penne pasta costs 30p for 500G.

Own brand tomato puree can be picked up from the supermarket for 40p for 200g, while a six-pack of tomatoes costs 69p.

The ingredients could make at least two portions of a pasta salad, meaning each portion costs slightly more than £1.

A daily spend on coffees can also be banished by taking in a flask. A 100g pot of Nescafe Original costs £2.75 at Tesco, which soon becomes the cheaper option compared to a daily £1.90 spend on a tall Starbucks flat white.

While some shop-bought soups can cost several pounds, a home-made vegetable soup can be made for just pence. British parsnips can be bought for 85p from Tesco, while Everyday Value Potatoes are about £1.18

Carrots can help add flavour to the soup and cost 53p for 1kg, while stock cubes can be bought for just 20p

A small swede helps thicken soup, costing just 70p from Tesco, while onions help to add flavour for just 16p

The research comes after energy watchdog Ofgem sparked debate by advising families who struggle to pay their heating bills to take packed lunches to work to save money.

Earlier this month, the watchdog was criticised for offering 'patronising' advice, rather than focusing on stopping energy firms from 'ripping off' customers.

Energy companies have come under fire for not passing on a sharp fall in wholesale prices to customers, while price comparison websites have been accused of hiding cheap energy deals.

A new study suggests energy firms have robbed the average family of £145 over the past year by failing to pass on a sharp fall in wholesale prices.

While energy bills are still more than £1,300, Ofgem suggested people could make a saving of £735.80 by making packed lunches.

Guidance issued by the regulator, drawn up by personal finance expert Jasmine Birtles, states: The average office worker spends £2.83 a day on buying lunch (based on meal deals of a sandwich, drink and snack). Save your money and instead make and take your own food into work.'

The watchdog also suggested cutting back on buying coffee, advising people to instead take a flask to work.

'Cut back on a morning coffee each day by investing in a reusable flask. Avoiding a £2.60 medium latte each day could help you save £676 across the year,' the guidance said.
