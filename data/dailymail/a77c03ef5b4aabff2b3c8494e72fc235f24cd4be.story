Heart-throb: James Morton has won the hearts of the viewers

Sporting horn-rimmed glasses and an itchy-looking jumper, he is an unlikely heart-throb, let alone promising amateur baker.

But 21-year-old medical student James Morton is the surprise star – and viewers’ darling – of BBC2’s Great British Bake Off.

His appeal – not to mention his choice in knitwear – has helped the show  cement its status as the summer’s television sensation. This week’s episode, the third in the series, pulled in 200,000 more viewers than last week, scoring a peak audience of 4.5million.

It means the show could beat the ratings of BBC1, the corporation’s flagship channel, in the coming weeks.

BBC1’s medical drama Holby City, which also aired at 8pm on Tuesday, won just 350,000 more viewers than BBC2’s Bake Off.

ITV, which broadcast a repeat of the  detective drama Lewis, managed to pull in a peak audience of 2.6million.

Fans of the cookery show tuned in to watch Morton, from Hillswick in the Shetland Islands, crowned ‘star baker’, an accolade given to the contestant who produces the best bakes.

This week, contestants had to produce three tarts – a French-style tarte tatin, treacle tart, and ‘show-stopper’ fruit tart.

Morton wowed judges Mary Berry and 
master baker Paul Hollywood with a perfect treacle tart and 
macaroon-topped rose, raspberry and lychee tart, making him a sure 
contender to win the series.

As
well as praise for his skills in the kitchen, he has also attracted a 
lot of female attention thanks to the range of woollen jumpers he has 
worn on the series so far.

Scores
of fans have taken to Twitter and other social networks to discuss 
Morton, who studies at Glasgow University, and his style.

Eleanor
Smith said: ‘I’m in love with Great British Bake Off. Possibly more so 
[because of] the baking, jumper-wearing James. Happy Times.’

And
on receiving the news he was the week’s star baker, one of the show’s 
presenters, Mel Giedroyc, congratulated him on his knitted tank top.

His
signature style has drawn comparisons with Sarah Lund, the fictional 
detective in hit Danish series The Killing, whose wardrobe also consists
almost entirely of Fair Isle knits.

Some viewers tweeted their fear of Paul Hollywood's tough love judging style

'Has Paul Hollywood always been this mean?' asks Helena Legget

His
jumpers have also won praise from the fashion industry, with Style 
magazine saying: ‘Well done James. We think your tarts look like fashion
on a plate! (and we love your tank top and glasses too!)’

The student 
has said he learnt to bake when he was a child.

‘I
used to go round to my gran’s house every day after school and bake 
apple pie and Victoria sponges and the occasional lemon meringue pie,’ 
he added.

The series has 
been pre-recorded and while Morton cannot talk about the outcome, he has
insisted he is still determined to qualify as a doctor, rather than 
pursue a career in baking.
