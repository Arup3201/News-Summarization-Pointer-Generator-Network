Accused: Donna Iman stole millions of dollars from a 92-year-old millionaire she befriended at church after pretending to have fallen in love with him, a court has heard

A woman stole millions of dollars from a 92-year-old millionaire she befriended at church after pretending to have fallen in love with him, a court has heard.

Donna Iman, 45, is alleged to have taken $3million from the unidentified retired military colonel over two years by claiming she had a series of illnesses, including cancer.

Police say she used the money to buy land worth $375,000 on which was building a million dollar house. She is also accused of using the money to get plastic surgery and buy cars for family members.

Iman is accused of first meeting her unidentified victim at St.Pius Church in Tucson, Arizona.

As their relationship developed, she is accused of convincing him that she had fallen in love with him and they were 'spiritually married'.

Tucson Police Department Sergeant Maria Hawke said: 'In this case, it's very clear she preyed on his vulnerabilities. Especially emotional vulnerability.'

Imam is accused of firstly telling the victim that she needed a new car.

She then told him she had a number of medical problems. Iman is alleged to have told the man that she needed a new pancreas.

She also told him that she had cancer.

The victim, whose wife died in 1999, began putting $4,000 each month into her bank account.

She was eventually arrested after the victim's friends at church told him to call the police.

A spokesman for the victim, whose wife died in 1999, said despite his fortune he lived a simple life in a trailer.

Bob Murray said: 'Do you think she was really in love with him? Hah hah, not at all, not at all.'

Iman is charged with felony theft and fraudulent schemes. As well as the criminal charges, a civil lawsuit has been filed against her.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
