It's proven to be a rather miserable summer for Steven Gerrard, who was England's captain as the Three Lions were dumped out the World Cup group stage.

The Liverpool skipper has also seen his team-mate Luis Suarez depart to Barcelona for £75million and has had to reflect on a 2013/14 campaign where the Reds just missed out on the Premier League title to Manchester City.

But the midfielder has started to look ahead towards the new campaign, as the 34-year-old hit the gym, showing off on Instagram an image of him performing what looked to be a dumbbell fly exercise.

Gerrard's England captaincy has come into question following the Three Lions' dismal showing in Brazil, but the midfielder has still yet to make a decision whether to stay on and lead England's qualifying campaign for Euro 2016.

The tournament will see Gerrard turn 36 once the finals in France comes around.

Liverpool's pre-season kicks off with a trip to Brondby, before they travel to the USA at the end of the month for the Guinness International Champions Cup where they will take on Manchester City, Olympiacos and AC Milan, as well as Roma in a separate friendly.
