A widely-used germ-killing ingredient in soaps, deodorants and even toothpaste has been banned in Minnesota over fears that the chemical has a negative effect on users health and the environment.

Governor Mark Dayton on Friday signed a bill to make Minnesota the first state to prohibit the use of triclosan in most retail consumer hygiene products.

Triclosan is used in an estimated 75 per cent of anti-bacterial liquid soaps and body washes sold across the United States, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

The federal agency announced last year that it would revisit the safety of triclosan and other germ-killing ingredients used in personal cleaning products.

Making a move: Triclosan is used in an estimated 75 per cent of anti-bacterial liquid soaps and body washes sold across the United States but now Minnesota wants to ban its use

While triclosan hasn't been shown to be hazardous to humans, studies have raised concerns that it can disrupt hormones critical for reproduction and development, at least in lab animals, and contribute to the development of resistant bacteria.

Action: Governor Mark Dayton signed a bill enacting the ban but it will not go into effect until 2017

The Minnesota ban isn't due to take effect until January 1, 2017 but one of its lead sponsors, state senator John Marty, predicted Monday that the odds are good that most manufacturers will phase out triclosan by then anyway.

Mr Marty, a Democrat, said other states and the federal government are likely to act, too.

He added that some companies are already catching on that there's no marketing advantage to keeping triclosan in its products, citing how Procter & Gamble's Crest toothpaste is now marketing itself as triclosan-free.

Critics including the FDA say there's no evidence that triclosan soaps are any more effective than washing with plain soap and water for preventing the spread of diseases.

A University of Minnesota study published last year found increasing levels of triclosan in the sediments of several lakes, and that the chemical can break down in those waters into potentially harmful dioxins.

Two months later, Dayton ordered all state agencies to stop buying hand soaps and dish and laundry cleaners containing triclosan.

The American Cleaning Institute had urged Dayton to veto the new bill, saying triclosan has been thoroughly researched and shown to provide important health benefits.

'Instead of letting federal regulators do their jobs, the legislation would take safe, effective and beneficial products off the shelves of Minnesota grocery, convenience and drug stores,' Douglas Troutman, the trade group's vice president and counsel for governmental affairs, wrote in a letter to Dayton.

ACI spokesman Brian Sansoni said Minnesota is the only state to enact a ban so far.

He said it remains to be seen whether any individual manufacturers would go to the expense of reformulating their products just for the Minnesota market or simply stop selling them in the state. He said triclosan is an issue best regulated at the federal level.

Under an FDA rule proposed in December, manufacturers of anti-bacterial hand soaps and body washes would have to demonstrate that their products are safe for daily use, and more effective than plain soap and water.

Otherwise, they would need to reformulate these products or remove anti-bacterial claims from the labels. The agency is still taking public comments on the proposal.

Some manufacturers have announced plans over the last couple years to at least partially phase out triclosan.

Procter & Gamble plans to finish dropping the chemical from its products this year. Johnson & Johnson plans to eliminate it from all its consumer products by 2015.
