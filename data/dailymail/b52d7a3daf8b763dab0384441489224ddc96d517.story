Booked: Emile Hirsch was formally booked following a brief court appearance on Monday in Park City, Utah

In court: Actor Emile Hirsch, 30, showed up to a Utah court on Monday to face charges he drunkenly put a film executive in a headlock at a nightclub in January and dragged her across the floor

The actor is charged with felony assault — which is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. He is also facing a misdemeanor count of intoxication.

A clean shaven Hirsch, who turned 30 on Friday, wore a tight-fitting black suit with a white shirt and black tie. He stared straight ahead as he walked through a small gaggle of reporters, photographers and onlookers at the Park City courthouse. He was flanked by two attorneys and a friend.

After his brief appearance before state Judge Kara Petitt, Hirsch was instructed to walk next door to the sheriff's office to get his mug shot taken. He isn't required to be at the next court date set for April 13.

The woman he's accused of assaulting on Jan. 25 is Daniele Bernfeld, an executive for the Paramount Pictures subsidiary Insurge Pictures.

Efforts to reach Bernfeld and her employer were not successful. Insurge Pictures distributed the Ben Stiller-produced Web comedy Burning Love, which was also on E! cable network.

Court documents say the altercation occurred at Tao Nightclub in Park City, when Hirsch, looking drunk, approached Bernfeld and asked why she looked 'so tough.'

He also said she was a 'rich kid who should not be at Sundance,' the documents say.

Investigators say Hirsch grabbed Bernfeld and she pushed him away. He left and sat with friends before coming back and grabbing the woman from behind, the documents say.

She was put in a chokehold and pulled across the table before Hirsch landed on top of her on the floor, authorities said.

Bernfeld told authorities she saw things going dark and might have blacked out momentarily.

Hirsch, of Encino, California, told police he didn't know Bernfeld but was having an argument with her.
