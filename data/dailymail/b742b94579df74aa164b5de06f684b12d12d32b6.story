David Cameron’s tax-cutting conference speech has helped push the Tories into their first national poll lead for two years, it emerged last night.

After the PM pledged two major tax cuts covering 30million workers if the Tories are reelected, his party took a narrow one point lead in the polls. 

The Conservatives were on 35 per cent; Labour were on 34 per cent and Ukip on 14 per cent in the YouGov survey for The Sun and The Times.

The Conservatives have taken the lead in the opinion polls, days after David Cameron's tax cutting speech at his party's conference 

The poll is a vindication of the Tories’ tax-cutting strategy and a major blow to Ed Miliband following his disastrous party conference speech – in which he forgot to mention the deficit or immigration.

It is the first time the Tories have had a lead in the polls since March 2012.

The Lib Dems were on just 6 per cent, their equal lowest rating for more than a decade. It comes as a bitter blow to Deputy PM Nick Clegg on the eve of his party’s conference in Glasgow.

Mr Cameron also posted a 21-point lead over Labour leader Ed Miliband on who would make the best Prime Minister – the biggest gap between the pair since February 2012. A total of 40 per cent preferred the Tory leader to be in charge, with just 19 per cent opting for the leader of the Opposition.

Mr Cameron has also seen a boost in a range of personal characteristics after the annual Tory gathering ended on a triumphant note this week.

On whether the PM is seen as strong, his rating is up 6 points to 46 per cent. On if he is decisive, he is up 3 points to 45 per cent. And even on his weakest point – on how much he is in touch with ordinary voters – he enjoyed a 7 point rise to 30 per cent.

In a rousing address at the conference in Birmingham, Mr Cameron said he modeled his speech on what most British families aspired to have 

The poll presents a dramatic vindication of the Prime Minister’s £7billion pledge for families at the end of the conference.

In a rousing address, he told delegates in Birmingham the next Conservative government would raise the 40p income tax threshold by more than £8,000 to £50,000 by 2020 – which would lift 800,000 people out of the higher tax band. The move will save £1,313 from the pockets of those who earn between £50,000 and £100,000.

The Prime Minister also pledged to increase the personal allowance of 24million taxpayers. No tax is currently paid on £10,000 a year. That figure will gradually increase to £12,500 by 2020 if the Tories remain in office.

Mr Cameron said that he had modelled his speech on what he believed most British families aspired to: ‘A good job, a nice home, more money at the end of the month, a decent education for your children and a safe and secure retirement’.

Other vote-winning promises included a pledge to rein in the European Court of Human Rights by replacing Labour’s Human Rights Act with a bill of rights and promising to reform migration rules.

Nick Clegg, who has been dealt a blow after it was revealed the Liberal Democrats are on their lowest rating in a decade 

The Prime Minister said that Scottish MPs would be barred from voting on English laws once powers are devolved.

Mr Cameron also vowed to crack down on youth unemployment and zero-hours contracts as well as provide 20 per cent discounts to first-time buyers of 100,000 new homes.

The last time Labour trailed in the polls was shortly before Chancellor George Osborne’s so-called ‘omnishambles’ budget in 2012. At that time Mr Miliband attacked the decision to cut the 50p top rate of income tax and freeze personal allowances for pensioners. 

 According to the poll, less than a fifth of current Ukip votes - 19 per cent - said the measures in Mr Cameron’s speech would make them better off overall, while 44 per cent said they would make no difference.

YouGov surveyed 2,133 British adults between October 1 and 2.
