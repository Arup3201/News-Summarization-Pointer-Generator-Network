When Christine Reid answered her telephone on Tuesday morning she was calm and collected as she uttered the words 'I wake up with Today'.

Moments later, the mother-of-five from San Remo on Sydney's Central Coast was breathless and in tears as the Channel Nine's Today show's hosts erupted in celebration.

The 45-year-old had just won herself the life changing sum of $100,000.

Christine Reid, a mother-of-five from Sydney's Central Coast, won $100,000 on Channel Nine's Today show

The 45-year-old was breathless and in tears as Channel Nine's Today show hosts erupted in celebration

'Thank you,' Ms Reid, who entered the competition 22 times, could be heard stammering before breaking down into tears.

She revealed that the lucky day fell right on her 15-year-old daughter Breanna's birthday, adding 'she can have anything she wants for her birthday now'.

Ms Reid told Daily Mail Australia that the money would change her life, allowing her to fix up her home and visit her family.

'My mum passed away six years ago and she left me enough money to buy a house. I couldn't buy a house in Sydney so I bought one in the Central Coast but I didn't have any money to do anything to it,' she said.

Joined by her younger daughter Breanna and son Brodie in the background, Ms Reid revealed that the lucky day fell right on her 15-year-old daughter's birthday before adding 'she can have anything she wants for her birthday now'

She said the money will allow her to travel to Sydney to visit her eldest children and her newborn grandchild

'The plumbing in my en-suite has been broken for the last two and a half years, the faucet in the kitchen sink is really loose, my neighbour wants to put colour bond fences in and I can't afford that - well I can now!

'My eldest kids and grandkids live in Sydney and I haven't been able to visit them so now I can!

'My eldest daughter just had a second baby so I can see them now - I can really do a lot, it's really life changing.'

The single mother revealed that a holiday was also in order, admitting that she hadn't been away since 1998 with her mother. 

Ms Reid (left with her first grandchild) explained that the money would mostly go towards perfecting her family home, saying she only just managed to buy the property with the money her late mother (right) had left her

Aside from paying off some bills, Today revealed that the sum of $100,000 could buy a single diamond ring from Tiffany & Co. or a particularly flashy Porsche. Otherwise it can buy 66 television screens, 66 pairs of Loui Vuitton shoes, 25,000 cups of coffee, 115 iPhone 6s or five first class trips around the world

Aside from paying off a mortgage and sorting out bills, Today revealed the real value of $100,000. The sum could buy a single diamond ring from Tiffany & Co. or a particularly flashy Porsche.

Otherwise it could buy 66 television screens, 66 pairs of Loui Vuitton shoes, 25,000 cups of coffee, 115 iPhone 6s or five first class trips around the world.

But Ms Reid is just happy to transform her life into what she says is 'the usual stuff that I suppose everyone else does'.

'I was right in front of the TV and I knew it was me, but all I was thinking was 'remember what you have to say and don't get it wrong',' she said.
