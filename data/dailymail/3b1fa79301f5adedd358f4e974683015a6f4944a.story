Andrew Baker, 64, pictured with wife Anne, 61, of South Petherwin, Cornwall, is accused of money laundering - his wife has already admitted money laundering and false accounting

A pensioner splashed out on a villa in Turkey and lavish home improvements using £1.1m his wife stole from her bosses at a top private hospital, a court heard today.

Andrew Baker, 64, invested £94,000 in a property in Bodrum and blew tens of thousands installing waterfalls, fountains and an aviary of exotic birds at his home in Cornwall, jurors heard.

The cash had been swiped by his wife, Anne, 61, during a ‘breath-taking’ 13-year fraud while she worked as a radiology department manager at the Princess Grace Hospital in Marylebone, central London.

She has admitted false accounting and will be sentenced later.

Using her maiden name Fitzpatrick, Anne Baker swindled a total of £1,142,101.92 by forging a string of 131 invoices authorising payment to a fictional radiologist, Dr Baker, for ‘consultancy services’.

The con took place between 1998 and 2012, when the hospital was run by HCA International Limited, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Mr Baker, allegedly a ‘key beneficiary’ of the stolen cash, also transferred £85,000 into two Turkish bank accounts and stashed £25,000 in a gun cupboard at his home.

He claims he had no idea about his wife’s wrongdoing, but the couple’s genuine income was ‘dwarfed’ by their dishonest earnings, prosecutor Hugh Forgan told the jury.

Mr Forgan said: ‘Anne Baker, the wife of the defendant Andrew Baker, between November 1998 and January 2012, while she was working at the Princess Grace Hospital, created 131 false invoices.

‘The creation of these invoices for payment [for work] which was never done enabled her to defraud her employers out of over £1m.

‘Often the defendant was the beneficiary of that money, sometimes via direct transfers to his bank account, other times the money was being spent on improving the matrimonial home.

The court heard that Mr Baker's wife defrauded the London hospital where she worked out of more than £1m

‘The crown say he was a key beneficiary of this very large amount of stolen money and he knew what he was doing when he received it.

‘The illegal income was many, many more times the legitimate income and the prosecution say the defendant must have known this.

‘From 2008 onwards there was income on his part coming out of rental property but that was effectively minimal.

‘We say he was living off her [Anne’s] income, which was mainly dishonest.’

Anne Baker, who retired from the hospital in March 2012, authorised a bogus invoice around once a month, with annual amounts ranging from £80,000 to £179,000, jurors heard.

The Bodrum villa was purchased in September 2007 before £85,000 was transferred to Guaranteed Bank accounts, which had Andrew Baker’s name ‘all over’ them, said Mr Forgan.

A further £88,882 was spent on building work at the couple’s home in Launceston, with more cash ploughed into landscaping projects.

‘Mr Baker turned the house in Cornwall into something rather splendid,’ Mr Forgan added.

‘We say that could only have been afforded when one factors in the dishonest money and the defendant knew he could afford it because he knew full well what his wife was up to.’

Andrew Baker, who was arrested in August 2012, told police the allegations were ‘crazy’.

He claimed he used cash from the sale of a property in Putney, south London, and money his wife received as a bonus to fund his extravagant purchases.

He insisted he was unaware during the whole period his wife defrauded her bosses, jurors heard.

‘Mrs Baker was charged with fraud and she has pleaded guilty to taking over £1.1m from the hospital,’ Mr Forgan told the jury.

Andrew Baker, of Manderley, South Petherwin, Launceston, Cornwall, denies two counts of money laundering. Anne Baker, of the same address, has admitted false accounting and two counts of money laundering and will be sentenced at the conclusion of her husband’s case. The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
