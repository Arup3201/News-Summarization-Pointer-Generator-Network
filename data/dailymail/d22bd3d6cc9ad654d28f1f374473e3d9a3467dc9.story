A film due to be screened at the 9/11 Memorial Museum has been blasted by a prominent Muslim cleric who claims it will 'greatly offend' Islam.

Sheik Mostafa Elazabawy, the imam of Masjid Manhattan, said the seven-minute documentary, which is designed to explain to visitors the historical roots of the terrorist attacks, may confuse viewers about the difference between Al Qaeda and Muslims.

The film, The Rise of Al Qaeda, refers to the terrorists as Islamists who viewed their mission as a jihad.

Narrated by NBC news anchor Brian Williams, the film was shown to an interfaith advisory panel, which included Elazabawy.

The panel asked for changes, but the museum declined and Elazabawy immediately resigned in March. He has written a letter to the museum's director:

'The screening of this film in its present state would greatly offend our local Muslim believers as well as any foreign Muslim visitor to the museum.'

will be beneath the World Trade Center plaza, is set to open on May 21

'Unsophisticated
 visitors who do not understand the difference between Al Qaeda and 
Muslims may come away with a prejudiced view of Islam, leading to 
antagonism and even confrontation toward Muslim believers near the site'
 Elazabawy wrote in his letter obtained by The New York Times.

In
 some scenes of the film the translations are voiced over by someone 
with a foreign accent - a decision the interfaith group bill as 
sensationalist.

Reverend Ruth Yoder Wenger, of New York Disaster Interfaith Services told CNN:
 'We're concerned that the way this story is told equates Muslims in 
general with al Qaeda, and that people coming away from viewing the 
video will make that same association in their minds.'

But museum
 officials are standing by the film which focuses on a 15-year span 
between Al Qaeda’s founding during the Soviet-Afghan War and the 9/11 
attacks.

'We
 have a very heavy responsibility to be true to the facts, to be 
objective, and in no way smear an entire religion when we are talking 
about a terrorist group,' Joseph Daniels, president of the nonprofit 
foundation that is overseeing the museum, told The New York Times.

Michael
 Frazier, a spokesman for the museum, said great efforts had been made 
to distinguish the terrorists from mainstream Muslims in the film which will be shown to visitors in a part of the museum next to a gallery with photographs of the 19 men who hijacked four planes.

'This 
brief film, within the context of surrounding exhibits, focuses on the 
roots of Al Qaeda with the express purpose of helping visitors 
understand who perpetrated the 9/11 terrorist attacks,' Frazier told the New York Daily News.

'It does not purport to be a film about Islam or in any way generalize that Muslims are terrorists.'

Meanwhile Mr Williams spokesperson told the New York Daily News:  'Brian
 did not take the request to narrate this film lightly and, after 
receiving a script from the museum, asked two leading experts to 
carefully review the wording,.'

'He was not involved in the editing of the film and has not yet seen a final version.'

The museum, which will be beneath the World Trade Center plaza, is set to open on May 21.
