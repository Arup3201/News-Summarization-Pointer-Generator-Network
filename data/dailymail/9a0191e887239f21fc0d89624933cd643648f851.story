Bruce Jenner was seen moving into his new very private and roomy hilltop property nestled deep within the hills of Malibu on Thursday.

And on Tuesday the inside of the $3.5m mansion was revealed.

The home, his second since leaving Kris Jenner, has modern touches and sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean as well as a luxurious pool.

On the move: Bruce Jenner was seen moving into his hilltop mansion in Malibu on Thursday

A look inside: On Tuesday a look inside the house, purchased for a little more than $3.5m, was made available; the property features four bedrooms, a three-car garage, and a pool/spa outside

According to sources quoted by Variety on Monday, Kris Jenner's ex bought the house for $3.575m, a bargain well below the $3.9m asking price.

The light grey 3,500 square-foot home is far from modest and sits on 11 acres of land (as reported by People).

Built in 2010, the concrete-and-glass structure came with four bedrooms, 3.5 baths, and 360-degree views of the surrounding hills.

Views: In addition to 360-degree vistas overlooking the surrounding hills, the house's veranda and pool have unobstructed views of the ocean

The swimming pool and spa attached to the house also offer an unobstructed sightline to the ocean.

A built-in grilling station and an outdoor fireplace are features out by the pool, located on a slightly raised wrap-around porch.

Back inside, the kitchen has a centre island fitted with white countertops and cabinets, as well as stainless steel fixtures.

Open plan: With no division between the living room (right) and dining room (left), glass walls give the house an open and airy feel

The main part of the mansion features an open-plan design, with a step-down living room with a fireplace and a dining room next to it.

Hardwood floors and ornate glass doors mark the entryway.

Even the master bath features mountain views from the bathtub - with no near neighbours this is still private - and a glass-walled shower.

A bathroom with a view: Even the luxury bathroom allows for spectacular views from the tub

Outside areas: The house is surrounded by covered patios and verandas

Outside, covered patios surround the building that has a three-car garage attached.

While the existing photos show the house before Bruce moved in, the E! reality star was spotted moving in several items, including a king-sized mattress and a bed frame.

Bruce's son, Brandon, was on-hand to help - he took off his shirt to move bar stools from a white pickup truck into the flashy residence.

Move-in day: While more furniture and belongings undoubtedly came separated, Bruce and his son, Brandon, were spotted moving in a few items 

Three-car garage: A fan of cars and other motorized toys, Bruce will likely fill his new three-car garage

Though it is large, the property is much less ornate that the Spanish style home he shared with Kris, 59, in Hidden Hills until 2013.

The Malibu residence also appears to be brand new with an untouched roof and what appears to be fresh landscaping around the home.

Bruce may have chosen to move now as he has been under the microscope lately.

Casual for the new place: The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star wore a blue striped golf shirt while Brandon went shirtless

Not only has he been strongly hinting that he wants to transition into a female (thanks to longer hair, painted nails and what appears to be a more curvy body sometimes covered by Spanx), but he was also the center of a fatal accident on Pacific Coast Highway on February 7.

The father of model daughters Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17, was driving a dark blue Cadillac Escalade at the time and dragging a dune buggy when he hit 69-year-old widow Kim Howe of nearby Calabasas.

She was in a white Lexus and pushed into oncoming traffic where a black Hummer smash into her, causing her to die.

Several others were involved in the accident as well and were taken to the hospital.

Go daddy!: Brandon watched as Bruce went back into the home where he will no doubt be filming his new E! reality series

Good deal: Surrounding houses have been priced as high as $10m, making Bruce's new digs a steal

His old pad: The property is much less ornate that the Spanish style home he shared with Kris, 59, in Hidden Hills
