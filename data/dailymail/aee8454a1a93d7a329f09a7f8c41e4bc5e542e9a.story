Patricia Goodband has been missing since mid-December and detectives said they have discovered a body at her home

Detectives searching for the body of a missing businesswoman discovered human remains near her home today.

Patricia Goodband, 76, was the director of a building supplies company that she ran from her home in Woodham, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

She was reported missing on January 9 but had not been seen since the middle of December.

Police said the body, which has not yet been formally identified, was found in Woodham. 

Detective Superintendent Chris Ward, who is leading the investigation, said: 'The body was found on land at Akeman House in Woodham this afternoon.

'Scenes of crime officers and a forensic archaeologist are continuing to work at the location.

'The recovery of the body will understandably take some time and we will not be able to carry out a formal identification until this process has been completed.

'Patricia’s family have been informed of this latest development in our inquiry.'

Two men have been charged in connection with the disappearance of Mrs Goodband, who was from Aylesbury and was reported missing by her daughter.

Christopher Symons, 63, of Thackeray End, Aylesbury, has been charged with murder.

Robert Taft, 59, of Kings Close, Westcott, Aylesbury, has been charged with perverting the course of justice.

Last week, a police search team of more than 20, backed by tracker dogs and a helicopter, were drafted in to search Miss Goodband's £500,000 gated home in the tiny rural village of Woodman, near Aylesbury.

It is understood that Miss Goodband - who uses the name Patricia Roberts in her business dealings - was chairman of the firm.

Neighbours of Miss Goodband said last week she was well-liked in the area and that her sudden disappearance seemed out of character.

Last week, a 53-year-old man who lives a few doors from the property and who did not want to be named, said: 'Pat was a lovely lady. She used to bring us mince pies every Christmas. You couldn't wish for a better neighbour.'

A 50-year-old woman who also did not want to be named said: 'She was a very traditional person, very homely. She wasn't the travelling type and she absolutely adored gardening.

'She was a very small lady not taller than 5ft 2ins with sparkly blue eyes.

'She used to be married many years ago and has lived in this property for 27 to 30 years, certainly since we've been here.
