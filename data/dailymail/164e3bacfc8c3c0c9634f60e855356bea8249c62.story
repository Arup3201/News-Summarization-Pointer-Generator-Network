A Southern California man has been arrested after being caught transporting a calf in the back seat of his car.

Cesar Zamora Santana, 31, was spotted by police on Wednesday morning suspiciously loitering outside an auto shop in Riverside at 1:50am.

They found he had an outstanding arrest warrant for  drug-related charges and conducted a search on his vehicle when the three-day-old, 150lb, Jersey cow was discovered.

Santana reportedly told police that he bought the animal for $200 at a gas station.

He was arrested on suspicion of transporting livestock without proof of ownership or identifying information. Another unidentified man  with Santana was questioned but ultimately released.

Animal control officers found that the ear identification tag had been forcibly removed from the bovine found in Santana's car.

Riverside Animal Services spokesman John Welsh says the female calf was turned over to a farmer to be fostered.

Meanwhile, authorities have launched an appeal to try to find its owner. 

Welsh described the incident as 'unusual' and 'very strange.'
