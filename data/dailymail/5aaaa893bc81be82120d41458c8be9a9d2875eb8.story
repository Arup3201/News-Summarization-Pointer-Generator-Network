A schoolboy took a selfie of himself with Prince Charles after he asked the Royal for a picture during a visit to a church centre.

The young boy took the picture before security staff could intervene after he asked the Prince of Wales if he could take a photo.

The boy, a member of the Coptic Orthodox Church Centre, in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, approached Prince Charles while he was chatting to the congregation yesterday.

He said: 'I went up to him and said if I could take a photograph of him - and then well I didn't wait for the body guards to push me out of the way, I just took a picture.'

Prince Charles, who was wearing a navy blue suit and checked tie, is seen standing behind the boy, looking into the camera.

The Prince was visiting the church to show his support for Christians in the Middle East.

He was accompanied by Prince Ghazi of Jordan and the pair aimed to show the importance of harmony between different faiths.

They were received at the centre by 
His Grace Bishop Angaelos, general bishop of the Coptic Orthodox Church 
in the UK, and the visit included a traditional prayer service.

They later had a private meeting to discuss the current situation in Egypt and the Middle East.

In July, schoolgirl Jessica Fitch could not quite believe her luck when she, with a little help from her dad, persuaded the Queen to pose for a photograph with her battered old teddy bear, Bertie.

At the time, Palace sources said they had never known of anyone to approach the Queen for a photograph, let alone persuade her to pose for one.

But Jessica, aged seven, wasnâ€™t content with one royal photograph â€“ she wanted to make it a hat-trick.

So the brave little girl went up to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and managed to get snaps taken with them, too.

Jessica, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was at Buckingham Palace with her parents Michael and Heather for the Coronation Festival.
