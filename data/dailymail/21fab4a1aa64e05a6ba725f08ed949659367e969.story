A Canadian traveller received a nasty surprise when he was hit with a sky-high $1,200 (£750) bill after using on-board wifi on a  Singapore Airlines flight.

Toronto businessman Jeremy Gutsche said he was shocked when he saw the charges and accused the airline of ripping off passengers who connect their devices to do work or just pass the time on a long-haul journey.

He said he racked up $1,200 in charges with just 155 page views, mostly to his email, and a file upload.

'Sticker shock': Jeremy Gutsche says he was charged £750 for using Singapore Airlines' in-flight wifi

The CEO of Trend Hunter wrote on his blog: ‘I know this because for the first time I counted up my page views to see where all the dollars went.

‘I wish I could blame an addiction to NetFlix or some intellectual documentary that made me $1,200 smarter.

‘However, the Singapore Airlines internet was painfully slow, so videos would be impossible and that means I didn’t get any smarter… except about how to charge a lot of money for stuff. I did learn that.’

Mr Gutsche spent an hour uploading a four-megabyte PowerPoint document.

He said: ‘That doc probably cost me $100 to upload, so I hope my team liked it.

‘I actually even emailed them a warning that my upload was taking a while. That email probably cost me $10.

‘And yes, the pricing per (megabyte) was disclosed on sign-up, but I bought the $30 package, slept through most the flight, and really didn't think I'd end up a thousand bucks past the limit.’

Singapore Airlines said its wifi price plans may be volume based or time-based, depending on the provider

On its website, Singapore Airlines said it offers wifi with different price plans on its Airbus A380 and Boeing 777-300ER aircraft.

Before passengers connect they must select a price plan through providers OnAir or Panasonic, depending on the flight.

Singapore Airlines said the price plans may be volume based (approximately £6.50 for 10 megabytes) or time based (approximately £7.50 for one hour).

Passengers can opt to have their session automatically disconnect when they reach their limit or they can stay connected and incur additional charges per kilobyte of data.

Mr Gutsche wrote on his blog: ‘I can think of a lot of other things I'd rather spend $1,200 on, like a flight… to Singapore!

‘But alas, I've already done that and the flight ended up costing way more than expected.’

He reached out to Singapore Airlines and was told that the matter is being investigated.

The carrier told MailOnline Travel: 'Mr Gutsche has contacted us with his feedback and we are following up directly with him on the matter.'

Singapore Airlines did not indicate if it will offer to lower the Canadian's outrageous bill.
