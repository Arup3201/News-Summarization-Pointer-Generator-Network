A classic Jaguar which has been left to rot in a garage for more than 40 years is expected to fetch between £15,000 and £25,000 at auction.

The Jaguar XK120 Competition Roadster was one of the world's top sports cars when it left the factory in 1953.

But over the past 43 years the car has been left abandoned in a Surrey garage, where it transformed from a stunning racing car into a heap of rust.

Rusty: The 60-year-old Jaguar was discovered in a disheveled state in a garage in Surrey, but is still worth at least £15,000

Discovered by auction house Coys, the find will come onto the open market for the first time when it goes under the hammer at the auctioneer's Ascot sale on Saturday.

Although the guide price is a reasonable £15,000 to £25,000, experts believe whoever buys the Jaguar will have to spend between £50,000 and £100,000 to return the car to its former glory.

The XK120 Competition Roadster was supplied new in 1953 to a Lieutenant in the army, who sold it to mechanic Douglas Potter in 1961.

Mr Potter worked for a number of racing teams and competed in various cars before getting his hands on the XK120.

The engineer then used his knowhow to turn the Jaguar into a competition car, racing it around the UK at circuits including Silverstone and Brands Hatch.

Under the bonnet of the Sir William Lyons-styled roadster was a 3.4-litre engine which developed 160bhp - giving the car a 0-60mph time of 10 seconds and top speed of 126mph. 

Abandoned: Mr Potter had not used the Jaguar in 43 years

Restoration project: Experts estimate it will cost the buyer £100,000 to have the car restored professionally, or around £50,000 to do it themselves

Both the car and its driver became well known in Jaguar and racing circles, but Mr Potter stopped his competition career in the 1970s to focus on aeronautical engineering.

Remarkably, the Jaguar then remained undisturbed at storage at his home in Surrey for the next four decades.

Graham Searle, from the Jaguar Enthusiasts' Club, expects there to be a lot of interest when it goes under the hammer.

He said: 'It has got a good recorded history which helps prices and when it has been restored it could easily be worth £150,000.

'The key thing is the history and this car will help the owner get into all the events like Goodwood and that is important.

'The
XK120 was a very important car in the history of Jaguar, it was their 
first ever genuine sports car and helped put them on the map.

'There
will be a lot of excitement about this. It will probably cost around 
£100,000 to restore professionally or at least £50,000 if the buyer does
it themselves.'

Racing: Mr Potter used the Jaguar as a competition car at circuits including Silverstone and Brands Hatch

Speedy: The Roadster, built in 1953, can reach 126mph and go from 0-60 in 10 seconds

Sale: The Jaguar will be auctioned alongside other classic cars at Coys in Ascot on Saturday

The Jaguar will be sold alongside a number of other classic cars including a Ferrari 512BB and Aston Martin DB2.

A spokesperson for Coys said: 'We are proud to offer this unique piece of Jaguar's competition history to the open market for the very first time.

'Complete with its original Buff Log book, and with a variety of period racing shots, bills and receipts this must be the most exciting XK discovery this decade.

'Here was a car with incredible style and looks, a powerful six cylinder engine installed in an outstanding chassis and a remarkably low price - a quarter that of a V12 Ferrari, of similar performance.

'The combination was unbeatable and the XK120 represented without doubt a significant milestone for both Jaguar and the motor industry as a whole.

'Highly original and unmolested, there will not be a more significant XK120 available anywhere in this condition.'
