A 10-year-old girl trapped a paedophile when she used her games console to take a picture of him touching her.

John Fisher, 46, was arrested after the brave youngster showed police the picture which officers described as 'indisputable proof' of his guilt.

He was jailed for three-and-a-half years yesterday at Ipswich Crown Court.

The judge heard Fisher first touched the terrified schoolgirl when she was nine.

She told her mother about the attack but nothing was done about it, the court heard.

But the twisted predator attacked her again over a year later when she was 10.

Robert Sadd, prosecuting, said the victim's quick thinking prompted her to reach for her games console and use the camera on her Nintendo DS to capture the assault.

Fisher, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, was caged after he admitted two offences of sexual assault in January 2010 and November 2011.

He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register indefinitely.

Fisher was made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order, restricting his contact with children under the age of 16 for the next ten years.

Judge John Holt said his attacks clearly crossed the custody threshold.

Steven Dyble, defending, said Fisher had admitted the crimes and had not committed similar offences before or served a prison sentence.

He added he had been honest enough to admit he was attracted to girls in their early teens.Â 

After the hearing, Det Con Annabelle Bunn, the Suffolk Police officer in the case, praised the girl for her courage and quick thinking.

She said: 'Her quick thinking in using her games console to take a photograph of him touching her provided indisputable proof of what had happened.

'She was brave enough to come forward and report the incident and give us a full and accurate account of what had gone on.

'Although Fisher initially denied assaulting her, when confronted with the image he had no choice but to concede he had done exactly as she had reported.'
