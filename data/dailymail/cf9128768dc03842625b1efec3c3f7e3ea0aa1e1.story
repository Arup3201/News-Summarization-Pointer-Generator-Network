The Duke of Cambridge formally registered the birth of Prince George yesterday, giving his wife’s occupation as ‘Princess of the United Kingdom’.

Kate has rarely described herself as a princess, preferring to use the title Duchess of Cambridge, which was conferred on her by the Queen on her wedding day.

But she is also Princess William of Wales, entitling her to be described as ‘Princess of the United Kingdom’.

Certificate: Prince William signed the birth certificate, and put his and Kate's occupations as Prince and Princess of the United Kingdom

Newborn: Prince George Alexander Louis was born on July 22 at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington and today his birth was registered by deputy registrar Alison Cathcart

The duke gave his occupation as ‘Prince of the United Kingdom’ rather than RAF helicopter pilot.

Normally, parents have to attend a 
register office within 42 days of a child being born. But in the case of
 Prince George, the third in line to the throne, the deputy registrar of
 Westminster, Alison Cathcart, travelled to Kensington Palace.

William was given a standard 
certificate to register the birth of ‘His Royal Highness Prince George 
Alexander Louis of Cambridge’. Miss Cathcart filled it in before it was 
signed by the duke, who has spent more than a week with the duchess and 
her parents in Berkshire. She remained there yesterday.

Signature: Prince William signed the birth certificate of his son George

Prince: Baby George is now third in line to the throne behind his father and grandfather

The certificate states the date and 
place of George’s birth – July 22 and the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s 
Hospital, Paddington. William’s full name, His Royal Highness Prince 
William Arthur Philip Louis Duke of Cambridge, is given, and the 
certificate includes Kate’s full name of Catherine Elizabeth Her Royal 
Highness The Duchess of Cambridge, her birthplace as Reading and her 
maiden name of Middleton.

The couple’s ‘usual address’ is described as Kensington Palace, London, and the duke signed the certificate simply ‘William’.

Miss Cathcart, who presided over Paul 
McCartney’s 2011 wedding, said: ‘It was a pleasure. Westminster City 
Council registered the birth of the Queen and Prince Charles and Princes
 William and Harry, so it’s great to see that tradition continue.’

History: As his father was before him, George's birth was registered by Westminster City Council

Residence: Most new parents have to go to the registry office but the registrar came to Kensington Palace so William could sign the certificate
