It is hard to believe it is 10 years since Wayne Rooney signed for Manchester United. Ten years since that first whispered press conference with partner Colleen sitting shyly in a corner of the room. Ten years since that explosive debut hat-trick against Fenerbahce in the Champions League.

Rooney has achieved much with his club and many ambitions have been satisfied.

At home in the Cheshire commuter belt, he has five Premier League medals and one from the Champions League. Now he is captain at Old Trafford and his country’s new leader, too.

Decade: Wayne Rooney (right) signed for Manchester United for £25million from Everton in August 2004

Signed: August 31, 2004

Fee: £25million (from Everton) 

Debut: Manchester United 6-2 Fenerbahce (September 28, 2004)

Appearances: 444

Goals: 218

Yellow Cards: 82

Red Cards: 2

Major Trophies: Premier League (5), UEFA Champions League (1), FIFA Club World Cup (1), League Cup (2) 

Undoubtedly, though, Rooney’s career with United now stands at something of a crossroads. It is time for phase two, time to show that he is capable of surviving and thriving in a Louis van Gaal team that looks to be set up perfectly for him.

When Rooney signed his new United contract last autumn, he was given assurances about transfers. Almost a year on, he finds himself playing in a United team featuring players such as Juan Mata and Angel Di Maria.

No longer does Rooney have to waste energy scurrying across the field in search of possession. No longer does he need to drop deep looking for the ball, looking for momentum. Once again he is a centre forward in the truest sense of the term.

Decorated: Rooney has won five Premier League titles, one Champions League trophy and two League Cups 

The identity crisis that sometimes seemed to overcome him during the later Sir Alex Ferguson years should, by rights, be no more. As such the responsibility to show that he is still worth the £250,000-a-week salary, worth the armband, is now his. 

On Saturday at Turf Moor, Rooney looked the part, physically at least. As the players emerged from a tunnel hardly wide enough to stand side by side, the 28-year-old looked as lean as he ever has. His performance, though, was modest and fitful. At the end of the game, it was hard to remember him being on the end of an opportunity.

This says much about United’s performance. Despite promising work from Di Maria on his debut, Van Gaal’s team didn’t function effectively as an attacking unit.

Arrival: Rooney moved to Old Trafford as a talented teenager but is now 28 and needs to lead from the front

Rooney, though, has a responsibility to lead now. He has always been a talismanic figure for United, often inspiring successful United teams with his hard work but also with moments of genuine quality and inspiration.

At Turf Moor he wasn’t able to do that. At his best, Rooney is a wonderfully instinctive footballer. On Saturday, though, he was unable to find the sureness of touch, the right pass, or the yard of space he needed in which to work.

There was one fine pass to Di Maria in the second half that gave the Argentinian a sniff of a chance on his left foot and, later, there was a clever bit of movement at the far post that allowed him time to head down towards the bottom corner.

Skipper: Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has made Wayne Rooney his club's captain this season

That effort only found the side netting, though. Unfortunately, there was not much more.

Asked about his new captain on Friday, Van Gaal revealed he had chosen him because of the way he impressed him during the pre-season period. Yet the United boss said he needs to see proof he was right.

‘I think he is ready for it but the future shall confirm that or not,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I cannot predict that but my opinion at the moment is that he shall be a great captain for Manchester United.’

Rooney moved to Manchester United on deadline day in the summer transfer window of 2004 for £25million from boyhood club Everton.

The transfer was a protracted affair. The young striker was pictured with a T-shirt with the message 'Once a Blue, Always a Blue' on it before heading to Euro 2004 with England.

The Merseysider starred for the Three Lions but was injured in the quarter-final as England were eliminated by Portugal. He returned to the country amid much fanfare and became the subject of a bid by Newcastle United.

Newcastle's interest sparked United into action and they upped their efforts to sign Rooney.

Sir Alex Ferguson wrote in his autobiography how Everton chairman Bill Kenwright weeped in his office, declaring 'they're stealing our boy, they're stealing our boy', when United pipped the Magpies to his signature on deadline day.

Hat-trick on debut against Fenerbahce (September 28, 2004)

Rooney began paying back his hefty fee instantly.

His injury hangover from the Euros had ensured he did not make his Manchester United debut until September.

But as soon as Rooney pulled on a Red shirt he looked at home. A magnificent hat-trick and an assist in his first game at Old Trafford. Not a bad way to introduce yourself...

Named Manchester United captain by Louis van Gaal (August 2014)

When Louis van Gaal announced that he was making Rooney his captain, the striker declared it as an 'honour'.

Rooney's reign as skipper has not started well but he seems invigorated by the challenge and responsibility of leading from the front and is overjoyed to have been given the role.

Lifting the Champions League trophy (May 21, 2008)

A day that Rooney will never forget.

The striker started United's victory on penalties over Chelsea in the first-ever all-English Champions League final and lifted the trophy after the match.

THAT overhead kick against Manchester City (February 12, 2011)

This is the moment that anyone who witnessed it will always remember Wayne Rooney for.

With the score tied at 1-1 at Old Trafford and just 12 minutes remaining on the clock, Rooney produced a moment of inspiration that won this Manchester derby.

Nani's crossed was deflected and looped behind Rooney, who shifted his body around before producing a magnificent overhead kick into the back of the net to win the match.

Simply sensational.

Striker requests to leave United due to lack of club's ambition (October 2010)

In a press conference in October 2010, Sir Alex Ferguson revealed that Rooney had asked to leave the club following an argument over the extent of the striker's ankle injury.

Rooney's representatives insisted he wanted to leave the club due to their lack of ambition and not for financial gain.

The striker made a dramatic U-turn just weeks later, however, and signed a massive five-year contract with the Red Devils.

Suspended by FA for swearing into TV camera (April 2011)

After scoring a hat-trick at Upton Park against West Ham United, Rooney ran to the corner and swore into a television camera in celebration.

The striker was handed a two-match ban by the FA and fined as a result.

Rooney hands in transfer request (May 12, 2013)

Following Sir Alex Ferguson's last day in charge of United, the Scot announced that Rooney had demanded a transfer.

Jose Mourinho, having returned as manager of Chelsea, attempted to lure the England striker to Stamford Bridge over the close season and eventually Rooney signed a new bumper contract at United worth £250,000-a-week.

Losing the title on last day of season to bitter rivals Manchester City (May 13, 2012)

United went into the last day of the season behind rivals City on goal difference. They headed to Sunderland and claimed a 1-0 victory and waited to see the result from the Etihad Stadium.

City were behind with just minutes remaining before Edin Dzeko bagged an equaliser and then Sergio Aguero netted the winner in the 94th minute to break Rooney and United hearts.

Sent off for sarcastically clapping referee (September 14, 2005)

Just a year into his United career and Rooney showed some petulance on the field against Villarreal.

Rooney had been booked by the referee for a foul and the striker responded by sarcastically clapping the decision, leading to a second yellow and an early bath.
