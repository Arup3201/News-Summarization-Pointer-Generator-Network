Golf isn't a sport known for players with reputations for physical toughness but no-one can doubt the iron will of Swedish golfer Daniela Holmqvist.

The Swedish 24-year-old felt a sharp pain in her ankle as she played at the a pre-qualifier for the ISPS Handa Australian Open at the Royal Canberra Golf Club in Yarralumla, Australia, yesterday.

Dangerous: Holmqvist was bitten by a Black widow spider, which secretes poison that can kill an adult in under an hour

When the Stockholm native looked down she realised she'd been bitten by a deadly Black Widow spider. Holmqvist swatted the arachnid away, but before she knew it she was doubled over in pain, reports Eurosport.

A Black Widow is so venomous that its bites can kill an adult in under an hour - children can die within 30 minutes if struck by the creatures, and the caddies were terrified by what might happen.

Did the LPGA Tour rookie faint? Scream for an ambulance? Cry hysterically? No.

While the panicked locals rushed around, Holmqvist, whose leg was already swelling up, calmly reached into her pocket, pulled out a golf tee and used it to gash open her bite and squeeze the venom out.

'When I told the local caddies in my group what had happened, they got very upset and said it was a Black Widow, and immediately started looking for their phones to call the medics,' Holmqvist told Svensk Golf.

Amazingly, Holmqvist played on 
through her pain, shooting a 74 on the day. Medics followed her around 
the course to make sure she didn't pass out.

She described the moment she bravely sliced open the infected wound.

'A clear fluid came out,' Holmqvist said.

'It wasn't the prettiest thing I've ever done, but I had to get as much of it out of me as possible.'

'It still hurts,' Holmqvist said last night. 'I don't recommend getting bitten by a black widow.'

She joked about the incident on Twitter, calling herself 'Spider-woman'.

Holmqvist joins the list of female sports stars who have grit their teeth and spectacularly played on through the pain.

One
such hardy soul is Kerri Strug, who severely sprained her ankle and 
damaged her tendons on the vault at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.

With
the team gymnastics gold medal on the line, Strug's coaches told her 
she'd have to jump again, not knowing that the score she'd received on 
the first vault had already guaranteed gold for the Americans.

Limping
as she walked to the runway, Strug nailed a two-foot landing, then 
quickly shifted her weight off her injured ankle as she raised her arms 
and saluted the judges.

She had to be carried off the floor and on to the medal podium by her coach (right) and was honoured with a trip to the White House.
