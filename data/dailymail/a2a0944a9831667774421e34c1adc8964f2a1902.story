For the man who is synonymous with the vacuum cleaner, it is his crowning glory.

After making billions as Britain’s best known engineer, Sir James Dyson has become one of the biggest private landowners in England, surpassing even the Queen.

His latest acquisition is the 3,000-acre Cranwell and Roxholme estate in Lincolnshire, bought from the Crown Estate.

New direction? There are reports that James Dyson could look into new innovations in farming technology

The 67-year-old inventor now owns around 25,000 acres – 5,000 more than the Monarch does in her own right with her 20,000-acre estate in Sandringham.

According to Kevin Cahill, author of Who Owns Britain and Ireland, Sir James’s recent purchase has seen his vast estate dwarf those of many members of the aristocracy.

He owns almost double the land of the Duke of Bedford, who has an estimated 13,000 acres in Bedfordshire and neighbouring counties, 14,000 acres more than the Duke of Marlborough’s 11,000-acre Oxfordshire estate based at Blenheim, and more than three times the Duke of Wellington’s 7,000-acre Hampshire estate.

Sir James, best known for the bagless vacuum cleaner, has declined to reveal how much the land in Lincolnshire cost.

But his Beeswax Farming, believed to be wholly owned by him or his family, is estimated to have land, machinery and property worth £217 million.

‘I grew up in agricultural north Norfolk,’ Sir James, whose fortune is estimated at £3 billion, told The Sunday Times.

‘As a schoolboy and college student I used to spend my holidays working on local farms harvesting potatoes, sprouts, parsley and blackcurrants.

'I’m enjoying farming in Lincolnshire, which is similar to Norfolk.’

His Nocton and Carrington estates are also in Lincolnshire.

Sir James’s main home for the past 11 years has been Dodington Park, an 18th century Georgian manor with 51 rooms in Gloucestershire near the headquarters of his engineering firm in Wiltshire.

He helped to remodel the 300 acres of parkland and expand its formal gardens. 

He and his wife Deirdre Hindmarsh also have a £3 million château in France, and a town house in Chelsea.

The entrepreneur, who recently announced a £1.25 billion investment drive in new products, including robots which can clean floors and do other chores while homeowners are out, says he hopes Dyson technology can also be harnessed to revolutionise farming techniques.

Incredible feat made possible because Queen owns little land outright

Only some estates are held in her name - including Sandringham
