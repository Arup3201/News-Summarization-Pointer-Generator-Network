Arsenal may be struggling to piece a defence together from their injury ravaged squad but Arsene Wenger has no such problems at the opposite end of the pitch.

The Gunners' 4-1 victory over Newcastle was only the second time this season that the manager has been able to play his three main attackers - Alexis Sanchez, Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck - together from the first whistle.

And, with Santi Cazorla and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in midfield, it appeared Wenger had settled for an all-out offensive gameplan to counter his deficiencies at the back - where Mathieu Debuchy was drafted in to central defence.

The front three in a 4-3-3 formation lined up with Giroud returning to his typical centre-forward role supported by the pace of Sanchez on his favoured right and a case of deja vu for Welbeck shunted out on the left.

The strategy was extremely effective in the first half at the Emirates with Arsenal dominating possession and early proceedings while Alan Pardew's side struggled to escape their own half.

After probing with their typical brand of pass and move football, two of Arsenal's front three combined for the opening goal. Teenager Hector Bellerin won back possession in the middle of the field before feeding Giroud who spread play out wide to Sanchez.

The pass may have been heavier than the Chilean had wanted but Sanchez managed to put in a superb return cross for the Frenchman to power home with a towering header in between two defenders to make it 1-0 to the Arsenal.

Welbeck was unfortunate not to double the lead only minutes later after racing into the area and digging out a lofted shot only for the goal to be ruled out for a nudge on Toon defender Daryl Janmaat.

The England international came close again in the first half when some neat interchanging passes on the edge of the area led to Sanchez playing a scooped pass over the top of the defence, which Welbeck met with a volley but skewed his effort wide.

Sanchez's role as a creator reaped rewards again after the interval when, with Arsenal still dictating play, the fleet footed winger cut in from the left and squared for Cazorla who dinked the ball over Fabrizio Coloccini and stayed on his feet to double Arsenal's lead.

Giroud netted his second only four minutes late following a rapid counter attack on the opposite flank where Oxlade-Chamberlain found Bellerin and the 19-year-old drilled in a low cross for the striker to finish exquisitely with the outside of his boot. 

Arsenal's defensive frailities were exposed when Ayoze Perez brought one back for Newcastle after prodding home a Jack Colback free-kick in a crowded penalty area. 

Still striving for full fitness, Giroud was replaced by Lukas Podolski to standing ovation on 73minutes. 

Sanchez could not extend his recent hot scoring streak but played an influential part in Arsenal's attack

Without him Sanchez and Welbeck almost got on the scoresheet from a breakaway move in the second-half, although the former Manchester United forward's touch from his team-mate's pass denied him a one-on-one opportunity.

Welbeck should be credited with an assist after being hauled down by Paul Dummett in the closing minutes to allow Arsenal to complete the rout courtesy of a cheeky 'paneka penalty from Cazorla. It was Arsenal's fourth shot on target and they scored from each of them.

Chants of 'There's only one Arsene Wenger' rang around the stadium and if the manager can keep playing this front three together for the remainder of the season the supporters will trust in Arsene again.
