A new report, backed by London mayor Boris Johnson, may make it easier for Australians to work and travel within the UK.

The report, penned by Commonwealth Exchange's Tim Hewish, urges the British government to rethink their immigration laws when it comes to Australia and New Zealand, by creating a 'bilateral mobility zone' between the countries. 

The report encourages a system similar to Australia's Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement (TTTA) with New Zealand, which allows free movement between both countries.

It also specifically mentions that New Zealanders are not eligible to receive Australian social welfare benefits when they are on the TTTA.

New Zealanders are given an arrival date when they enter Australia but no termination date. allowing them to work, live and visit for an indefinite period of time.   

It is hoped that this scheme would dramatically restructure the current UK arrangement, which has seen a drop in Australians migrating to the UK from 40,000 in 1999 to 26,000 in 2011.

The report, 'How to Solve a Problem like a Visa', has received Boris Johnson's seal of approval, who claims the 'UK needs immigration controls and an end to porous borders'.

In the report, Mr Johnson recalls his trip to Australian in 2013 and how it inspired him to be an advocate for new UK visa laws. 

'In 2013 I visited Australia and was reminded of the myriad enduring bonds between 'the English-speaking peoples,'

'I was also struck by the strength of the Australian economy'

'British are more deeply contacted with Australians – culturally and emotionally – than with any other country on earth,' he said.

The TTTA would be a starting point for the UK to build a fair and reasonable regime with Australia.

The report quoted an unnamed Australian nurse who recently returned home after spending 2 years in London on the Tier 5 YM Visa.

While she had no intentions of staying in Britain long-term before she left Australia, the nurse met somebody while she was travelling and she is now left in limbo, wondering how she can return.  

'I didn't have a workplace willing to sponsor me,' she said. 

'What really upsets me is the fact that I am a nurse. Anyone can see the UK is in dire need of well-trained Western nurses.

'I know because I worked alongside many European nurses that had poor English skills and whose clinical skills were borderline dangerous,' she said. 

An Australian teacher, who works in the UK, told the report that it is scandalous how many hoops Australian citizens have to jump through in order to stay in the UK.

'The amount of processes that Australian and New Zealand and other Commonwealth citizens have to do just to stay in the UK is absolutely ridiculous. Something needs to be done,' she said.  

In the report, Johnson also states that the same conditions would apply for British citizens who wanted to work and live in Australia.

'Extra Brits would never be seen as alien,' the report predicted.

'Nor would Aussies or Kiwis in Britain. The issue may come down to political climates and the resulting political will. 

'The UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand share the same head of state, the same language and the same common-law legal system. 

'Critically, they are all highly economically developed democracies and there is also a distinct common culture and familial bond between them. 

The report also touches on Australia's recent attitude towards immigration, claiming that it would morally be wrong for the Australian Government to allow Britons to work and live in Australia and refuse Asian nationals.

'This issue may come down to political climates and the resulting political will,' the report said. 

For instance, Australia's current attitude towards immigration has become quite turbulent in relation to Asian asylum-seekers and their branding as 'boat people'.

'It may be seen as hypocrisy for any Australian Government to on the one hand allow freedom of work and movement of Britons yet on the other refuse entry to nationals from Asian countries,' the report said. 

The Commonwealth has a combined population of 2.3bn people in its collection of 53 developed, developing and emerging economies

In the report, Johnson also states that the same conditions would apply for British citizens who wanted to work and live in Australia

'At present the UK underutilises this network and the Commonwealth is undermined by an outmoded UK visa regime,' the report said. 

It goes on to claim that the Commonwealth countries matter to the UK because they represent the nation's past and future legacy. 

Yearly immigration by nationality from Old Commonwealth nations – Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa – peaked at 73,000 in 2004. 

This figure crashed to 29,000 in 2011.

2012 brought only slight increases in migration from Australia 

In September 2013,  Boris Johnson, floated the idea of establishing bilateral labour mobility zones between the UK and Australia. 

In his regular Daily Telegraph column, the mayor highlighted the story of Australian school teacher Sally Roycroft,  who was forced to return to Australia after her visa expired and her school did not renew it. 

'In spite of all her efforts she has been effectively kicked out of Britain,' he said.

'What is her crime? That she isn't French. Nor is she German, or Polish, or Croat, or Italian, or Greek, or Portuguese,'

'In 1973 we betrayed our relationships with Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand.

'it was assumed that in order to be internationalist it was enough to be European. Well it is perfectly obvious in 2013 that this is no longer enough and we need to seek a wider destiny,' he said.
