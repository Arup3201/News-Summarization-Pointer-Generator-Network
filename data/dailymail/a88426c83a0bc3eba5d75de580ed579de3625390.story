Posing proudly for the camera, this is the moment Paul Griffith was finally able to hug son Kyle after being apart for 22 years.

Six days later, his 25 year old son was killed by a drug-crazed driver.

Chef Kyle, of Cardiff Bay, was walking
home from work in the early hours of January 11 when drug addict 
Stephen Freye deliberately drove into him at around 60mph after snorting 70 lines of cocaine.

Now the young chef's father Paul, 46, has spoken about the plans the pair had made to make up for their years apart.

The last time he saw his son before this poignant picture was taken was when Kyle was three, shortly before Mr Griffith split from his mother.

He explained how it felt to lose his son, himself a father, for the second time after tracking him down on Facebook.

Mr Griffith told the Mirror: 'We’d talked about him moving near me and I was jubilant at the prospect.'I was so looking forward to us doing things as father and son.'

Freye claimed he was hallucinating after sniffing a bag of 10 grammes of cocaine over a weekend.

Cardiff Crown court heard Freye confessed to police at the scene: 'I was told to kill a stranger.'

Freye, of Roath, Cardiff, denied murder but was found guilty on Monday following a two week trial.

A judge jailed him for life and said he would spend a minimum of 13 years behind bars.

Devastated Mr Griffith said 'no sentence was long enough' for what his son's murderer had done. 

Mr Griffith, of Star in Pembrokeshire, said he had been trying to get access to his son for years before tracking him down on the social networking site.

The builder who is now married to Helen, 49, said it had taken time for he and his estranged son to see eye to eye, before finally agreeing to meet up.

He added: 'Then just days later he was killed.'

Sentencing Freye Mr Justice MacDuff said he had read victim impact statements from Kyle’s mum, step-dad and sister.

He told Freye: 'They make for harrowing reading - Kyle was a thoroughly lovely and worthwhile man whose life has been wasted.

'He was an innocent man, a young man and father and was walking home after a night in town and minding his own business when you ran him down.

'You were in a psychotic state, hallucinating and hearing the voice of your drug supplier telling you to kill.

'You had voluntarily taken drugs over three days when you knew full well the effect they had on you.

'You were tempted by your addiction but the decision was yours and you bare the responsibility.

'Kyle was a fine young man, who was greatly loved and had a promising life in front of him.

'He was hard working and bared no animosity to anyone, he had a young daughter who he adored and he touched many lives.

'His sister had to celebrate her 21st Birthday four days after her brother’s death. You turned that event, a celebration, into one of mourning.

'You told the jury you were truly sorry, you were sorry, but only for yourself. Your words were hollow and your attitude in the dock today shows no contrition.

'You will have to live with your actions for the rest of your life.'

Prosecutor Huw Evans said: 'Freye had taken cocaine and had suffered hallucinations shortly before he drove straight into innocent Mr Griffith.

'He told police that at the exact moment he saw his victim, the voices told him his own family would die if he didn’t drive at him.

'He said he didn’t even think, he just assumed that if he ran him over, everything would be okay.

'He deliberately drove at him and his intention was to kill or cause serious injury.'

Mr Griffith was a chef at Cardiff Arts Institute.

The jury was shown home movies made by Freye in his flat taking cocaine and apparently searching for the voices he claimed he could hear.

The films, made in the dark, show him sitting staring at the camera and looking around the room.

Freye claimed he was driving to a police station in his Fiat Cinquecento to tell them about the voices when he saw Kyle on the roadside in January this year.

He denied murdering Kyle but admitted manslaughter claiming he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time.

Freye told the jury: 'The coke was so irresistible that when I got it from the dealer, I started snorting it from the bag on the way back.

'I was just totally a slave to it.

'The voices had complete control of me. As soon as I saw him, the voices spoke.

'And as soon as I heard them, I turned the car - I didn’t have time to think.'

Speaking outside court a spokesman for the Kyle’s family said: 'No punishment given could ever bring Kyle back nor ease the pain of his tragic and sudden death.

'However we are pleased that some justice has been done today.'
