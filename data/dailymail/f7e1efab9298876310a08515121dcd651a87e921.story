A new study into the benefits of Tai Chi for patients suffering cystic fibrosis is being funded by the family of a woman who lost her life to the disease.

Tracie Lawlor died in November 2007 of sepsis, after being admitted to hospital for what should have been  routine treatment for her illness.

The 24-year-old was diagnosed with the genetic condition, which causes a build up of mucus in the lungs and digestive system, when she was just a year old.

In a cruel twist of fate, her younger brother Joe, born three years later when Tracie was four, was also diagnosed with CF.

Tracie Lawlor, 24, died in November 2007 after being admitted to hospital for treatment for her cystic fibrosis

Tracie was diagnosed with the hereditary disease, which causes a build-up of mucus in the lungs and digestive system, when she was a year old. Her family are now raising money to fund a new research programme into the effects of Tai Chi on the condition

Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease caused by a faulty gene. 

The gene controls the movement of salt and water in and out of the cells in the body, and so causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with mucus.

Sufferers struggle to breathe and digest food and require intensive therapy and treatments.

Six months after his sister's death, Mr Lawlor, from Wexford in Ireland, and his family established the Tracie Lawlor Trust for Cystic Fibrosis (TLT4CF). 

The family's aim was to help CF patients and fund evidence-based complementary medicine for CF sufferers, to help improve their quality of life.

The trust has set up a patients' assistance fund, directly paying for or buying equipment for patients, including treadmills, bikes, pulse oximeters, while others get acupuncture and Tai Chi. 

The 25-year-old, neuroscience student, told MailOnline: 'We set up the trust to help other patients with cystic fibrosis.'

He said they have raised nearly £200,000 since setting up the trust in 2008.

And of that, nearly £40,000 has been raised to fund a new study into the effects of Tai Chi on patients suffering CF.

The study is being carried out by a team of researchers from London's South Bank University at the Royal Brompton Hospital in the capital.

Tracie's brother Joe, pictured, was also diagnosed with CF when he was born. He and his family set up the Tracie Lawlor Trust for Cystic Fibrosis in 2008, to raise money to help other sufferers in her memory

So far the trust has raised nearly £200,000 since it was established. To fund the remainder of the study at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London in Tai Chi and its effects on the condition, Mr Lawlor said they need to raise a further £11,000

Mr Lawlor said: 'You can sit down and take it or get up and move, was her (Tracie) outlook. She convinced me to do the same.'

Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease affecting the lungs, glands, pancreas and digestive tract.

It is caused by a faulty gene.

The gene controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your cells, so the lungs and digestive tract become clogged with mucus, making it hard to breathe and digest food.

More than 2.5 million people in the UK carry the faulty gene - around one in 25 of the population.

There is no cure for the disease. But there are a number of different treatments available to help manage the condition, including physiotherapy, exercise, medication and nutrition.

Each week five babies are born with CF and two people in the UK die from the disease.

More than half of sufferers will live past the age of 41, and improved care treatments mean a baby born with CF today is expected to live even longer. 

Symptoms of CF include a troublesome cough, repeated chest infections, prolonged diarrhoea and poor weight gain.

Mr Lawlor said: 'It is really exciting as it has never been done before. 

'It is something I do to help my CF and it helps  my mental health and overall feeling of wellbeing.

'It is excellent at maintaining health for CF patients and improving mental health too.'

The study is already underway and in total the TLT4CF need to raise around £51,000. 

This weekend a group of friends are taking on the Three Peaks Challenge to try and help Mr Lawlor and his mother Philomena Lawlor,56, from Wexford, raise the final £11,000 needed to complete the research.

Mr Lawlor said the trust is a 'fitting' tribute to his big sister's memory. 

He told MailOnline: 'The two of us became very close.

'She was my big sister and was always making sure I didn't skip my medication. She proved to me that you could do anything, regardless of being a CF sufferer.

'She showed me it was possible to go to college and travel. Tracie spent six months in China, she did what she wanted and proved it to me too.

'Of course it took a lot of effort and determination but she was always positive.

Mr Lawlor said Tai Chi helps him to maintain his health as well as improving his mental health. He hopes the results of the study will help other sufferers

'As a CF patient you always hear negative stories, horror stories, but Tracie's story was an example of real achievement despite her illness.

'Tracie had so many friends, she never let CF hold her back. If I ever whinged about it, I would get a swift slap around the head.'  

Mr Lawlor added: 'Tracie had a firm belief that laughing is a massive part of life and we all should live life laughing.

'She managed to draw on this in all situations and it seemed to work.

'I would often ask, "what's the point if you live so short? What's the point if you're going to die"?

'She would reply, "it's not about how long but how much you do".

'And she led by example, she volunteered as a helper for a charity in New York, helping disabled children. 

'You can sit down and take it or get up and move, was her outlook. She convinced me to do the same.'

The money raised for this weekend's Three Peaks Challenge will go directly to the Research Council for Complementary Medicine, who are working with the Tracie Lawlor Trust, to enable them to continue their research into Tai Chi.
