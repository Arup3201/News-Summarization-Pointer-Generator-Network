The National Park Service says a pair of hikers made it down one of Colorado's highest peaks on their own after being stranded by an ice storm for two days.

The news came just as the Park Service was organizing its latest effort to rescue the women from 14,200-foot Longs Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park.

'They are fine, they were not injured,' said Patrick O'Driscoll, a spokesman for the Intermountain Region office of the National Park Service.

Conditions created by the ice storm were so bad that 32-year-old Connie Yang and 33-year-old Suzanne Turell had sent text messages urging rescuers to come quickly.

Colorado's highest mountains

Challenging: Longs Peak is one of Colorado's highest summits standing at over 14,000 feet

SOS by SMS: The mountain is around 70 miles northwest of Denver but weather conditions can change rapidly and trap even the most experienced climbers

The climbers provided their precise latitude and longitude and said they were not hurt, but raging floods at the bottom of the peak have left roads impassable and made it impossible for rescue crews to reach them.

A text sent on Thursday morning read: ‘We need help. At top of longs peak. 13400 feet. Whiteout snowstorm.’

A follow up text sent shortly afterwards conveyed the hopeless nature of the situation.

‘Can’t move because of ice Storm, don’t know how long it will last. Been here for 1 day trying to wait it out.’

Desperate: Texts were sent from climbers Suzanne Turell and Connie Yang to Connie's sister who created a Tumblr page

No help needed... in the end: Two experienced climbers trapped for two days by an ice storm near the peak of a 14,000-foot mountain in Colorado managed to get down on their own

The texts were sent to Ms. Yang’s sister who set up a Tumblr page to keep friends and family up to date on the rescue.

The women were hunkered down inside a tent in whiteout conditions.

The couple, who live in York, Maine, are experienced when it comes to mountaineering and have spent several weeks on and off the Pacific Coast Trail last year and work for New Hampshire-based outdoor gear manufacturer NEMO Equipment Inc.

Employers and family members say the two set out a week ago on a backpacking trip in Rocky Mountain National Park. They got stranded 800 feet below the summit.
