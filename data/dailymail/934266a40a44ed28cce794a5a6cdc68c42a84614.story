An 'evil' Lithuanian couple who viciously attacked a frail 88-year-old at his Lancashire home and ransacked his home have been jailed.

Laurynas Dauksas, 25, was sentenced to 11 years in prison and Aurelisa Galdikaite, 23, to nine years for their 'despicable' attack on Arnold Hilton.

Liverpool Crown Court heard that the pair entered Mr Hilton's home in Upholland, Lancashire on the night of March 20.

'Evil': Mother-of-one Aurelisa Galdikaite, 23, was sentenced to 9 years and her partner Laurynas Dauksas, 25, was sentenced to 11 for the robbery of 88-year-old Arnold Hilton

Dauksas, who was on licence after 
being released from prison for a motoring offence, beat Mr Hilton as 
Galdikaite, a mother-of-one, ransacked 'every drawer in every room' in 
his house.

The former Bevin Boy and glazing
firm manager was found by his son, Stuart, collapsed and bleeding on 
his bedroom floor at 6.30am the next day and told him: 'I'm not going to
make it.'

'Mercifully',
Judge David Aubrey QC said, Mr Hilton did survive. But after spending 
two weeks in hospital he is now living in a care home and has not been 
able to return to his own home.

Dauksas and Galdikaite both pleaded guilty to one count of robbery at an earlier hearing.

In mitigation, Frances Hertzog, for Dauksas, said he had 'expressed remorse for the attack'.

Jonathan
Lally, mitigating for Galdikaite, said her young child had been taken 
to Lithuania after her arrest and she was unlikely to see the child for 
many years to come.

The defendants of Worsley Mesnes, Wigan, received sentences longer than 12 months which means they will face automatic deportation on their release.

Speaking
outside court, Stuart Hilton said his father, who has five children, 10
grandchildren and one great-grandchild, had changed drastically since 
the attack.

Mr
Hilton, 43, a quality control inspector from Preston, said: 'Up until 
this happened, even though he was 88, he was still sociable.

'He used to travel two miles on the bus from his house to his pub to see his pals and then get it back.

'Sometimes, he would walk it in summer, so he was fit and active.

'He loved his sport, he played golf for years and enjoyed watching football and rugby.

'He's gone from going out three or four times a week to living in a care home and having 24-hour care.'

Victim: Arnold Hilton, 88, pictured here in hospital with appalling 
injuries told his son 'I'm not going to make it' following the shocking 
attack in March this year

Mr Hilton said it was very hard to witness how his father changed after the attack.Asked about the defendants, he said: 'As individuals they are the lowest of the low, but justice has been done.'

Detective Inspector Marc Nasser, of Lancashire Police, said: 'Stuart Hilton called in to see his father as a matter of routine en-route to work and finding his father in that state must have been devastating.

'This was a disgraceful attack on an innocent, defenceless and vulnerable man who has been left traumatised and confused by the attack.

'The level of violence used was beyond comprehension and I am disgusted and appalled that anyone could do this.

'Sadly as a result of this incident Arnold now lives in a care home and will never been able to return home. He has lost much of his independence and confidence.

'This really was an appalling crime and I am pleased that Dauksas and Galdikaite are both behind bars.'

As both defendants received sentences longer than 12 months, they will face automatic deportation on their release.
