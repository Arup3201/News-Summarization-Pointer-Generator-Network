Most of us would turn and run when faced with an erupting volcano.

But one intrepid photographer has trekked right up to a molten lava spewing crater in search of the perfect shot.

Miles Morgan was just one metre away from the source of the eruptions when he took some of these incredible images of Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii.

The 42-year-old - who burned his feet while taking the shots, said: 'On this outing we were able to access the beach, which made for some dramatic photography, but came with a surprise.

'I wasn't too concerned as some bigger waves started to crash onto the beach area. But the water rushed in above my knees, it was scalding hot.'

The Kilauea Volcano is one of the most active volcanos in the world and has been erupting constantly for the last 20 years.

But Mr Morgan was determined to get as close as possible for his shots.

He added: "At times, it was possible to get right up to the flow itself if the wind was blowing the plume away from us.

'The closest I got was probably about one metre, which required me to run away each time a wave hit the lava in case there was an explosion.'

Mr Morgan, from Portland, Oregon, USA, was not injured while taking his images but admits another photographer was lost and is thought to have been killed just a week before he took these shots.

He said:'The most probable cause would be that a portion of the lava bench that builds out over the sea collapsed while he was on it.'

The photographer, who also works as an airline pilot, said his wife supported his adventures, but admits he usually hides his expeditions from other family until afterwards.

He added: 'Things change every second, so timing the shots and the waves is a constant battle.

'The most important challenge, was not allowing yourself to become so hypnotised by the lava that you lose sight of the very real and ever-present dangers that surround you.'
