Ukraine was forced to shut down a reactor at its biggest nuclear power plant yesterday following an 'electrical malfunction', the second such incident in the space of a month.

One of six reactors at the  Zaporizhia power station in the south-east of the country was automatically disconnected by the plant's 'internal defence mechanism' at 6am yesterday morning.

Workers managed to repair to the fault and the reactor was reconnected to the power grid at 22:35, the plant's operator's NPP said in a statement.

Shutdown: The Zaporozhiya nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine where one of six reactors was automatically taken off-line yesterday following an electrical fault

Earlier this month another of Zaporizhia's reactors was taken off-line after it suffered a short-circuit leading to widespread blackouts.

The plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and the fifth largest in the world, supplies around 40 per cent of Ukraine's nuclear power and was switched on in 1984. 

The incident has revived memories of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster - the worst nuclear power station accident in history in which 31 people were killed and large amounts of radiation released into the environment.

A statement on the Zaporizhia plant's website said radiation levels around the facility remained at normal levels and that the accident was being investigated.

Ukraine is in the grip of an energy crisis with authorities in Kiev  refusing to buy coal from the conflict-hit Donetsk and Lugansk regions, fearing it could benefit pro-Russian factions.

To make matters worse around half of the country's coal-fuelled power stations are said to need emergency repairs.

The Chernobyl disaster was the worst nuclear power station accident in history resulting in the deaths of 31 people and large amounts of radiation being released into the environment

There are fears for the safety of the Zaporizhia plant as lies only 200 kilometres from the rebel-held Donetsk region.

Two of Zaporizhia's reactors are due to be decommissioned  in February  having been operating for over 30 years.

In May pro-Ukrainian paramilitaries confronted police and security at the plant claiming they had come to remove 'pro-Russian' agitators they claimed were operating inside the plant.

 Zaporizhia  produces up to 22 percent of all electricity generated in the country.
