When most children dress up as their favourite superhero, it is usually just to play imaginary games with their friends in the back garden. 

But for five-year-old Harley Renshaw, it is in order to help him be brave while he undergoes chemotherapy treatment for an aggressive form of childhood cancer.

Harley was diagnosed with cancer in his kidney, lung, bone and neck just after starting primary school and had to have 14 sessions of chemotherapy lasting three months.

While he was treated at The Christie Hospital, Manchester, he had to wear a special face mask which he decorated like his favourite Ninja Turtle to help him feel brave.

Mother Stacey Parker, 23, and dad Oliver Renshaw, 25, said Harley had been amazing during his treatment, also making special beads of courage.

Ms Parker said: 'Not once did he complain about going for treatment. He has a big scar right across his belly which he calls his "pirate scar". We couldn't be any prouder of our boy.

'He has had such a lot to deal with this year and he just takes it all in his stride and gets on with it. He is a true inspiration and he is our hero.'

The family only discovered Harley was ill shortly after he started school, when his mother took him to a walk-in clinic with a pain in his stomach.

He was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare and aggressive childhood cancer, and was sent to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital to undergo pioneering treatment.

He has since had 80 days of intensive chemotherapy and has had an operation to remove his kidney tumour.

A month later he was back at hospital for a stem cell transplant, fighting back from complications to return home for his fifth birthday, before undergoing 14 days of radiotherapy.

He is now facing a further five months of treatment as he is given five rounds of immunotherapy. 

Stacey said: 'When we received Harley's diagnosis, we were in complete shock. Our world came crashing down and we were terrified. 

'But not once did Harley complain about going for treatment. The hospital staff were amazed at how well he behaved during his radiotherapy and how he managed to keep so still.'

Harley has now been awarded one of Cancer Research UK's Little Star Awards which acknowledges the unique challenges faced by youngsters who encounter cancer. 

Cancer Research UK is calling on people to nominate more Little Stars. 

The awards, in partnership with TK Maxx, are open to under-18s who have cancer or who have been treated for the disease in the last five years.
