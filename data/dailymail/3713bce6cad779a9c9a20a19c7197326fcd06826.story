Gatwick Airport has launched an urgent investigation after a man passed through to the departure lounge without a ticket.

The man, believed to be a Turkish national, managed to pass through the security area and reach the departure lounge at around 8.20am this morning, despite not having a boarding pass.

The incident comes less than a week after it was revealed that security checks were being enhanced at airports with uncharged electronic devices being refused access.

Security breach: A man got airside at Gatwick Airport this morning despite not having a boarding pass

It is believed that the man was not intending to travel, but wanted to see his family off.

They passed through a buggy lane – but security staff failed to tally the number of boarding passes with the number of people coming through.

They then passed successfully through the airport’s scanning procedures and into the departure lounge.

Shopped: A retail unit asked the man for his boarding pass and alerted security teams when he failed to produce one

Airport security staff were alerted to the breach by a retail unit, which as a matter of course had asked the man for a boarding pass when he tried to make a purchase.

One source told The Surrey Mirror: ‘A Turkish man managed to walk straight through customs to departures - and he had no tickets. He managed to get airside.

‘It’s a huge breach of security but staff have been told not to talk about it and not to tell anyone. I think it’s appalling.

‘How did he get through? He was with his wife and came through the buggy and family track. Security are playing it down and saying it’s no big deal but it is.’

A Gatwick Airport spokesperson said: ‘Earlier this morning a gentleman accompanying his family through the airport was incorrectly allowed access to the departure lounge without having a boarding pass.

‘The incident is being investigated but all individuals correctly passed through the series of full security search and screen processes.’

The electronic device checks introduced by the Department for Transport last week will not affect all UK passengers.

Although they have refused to make public the routes affected, ministers have provided a list of flights they consider require additional security checks.

It is understood this includes flights to and from the Middle East, Africa and parts of southern Europe.

If your flight is hit by additional security checks, it is unlikely you will know much about until you reach the boarding gate.

Arriving at the airport, passengers will check-in their hold luggage and pass through body and bag scanners into the departure lounge in the usual way.

This will include ensuring all electronic devices being taken on board the flight - such as cameras and laptops - are packed away inside hand luggage bags.

Passengers are likely to expect extra checks if they are called to the departure gate earlier than usual.

This is to allow for the extra time it takes security staff to check every electronic device is working properly.

The Department for Transport says all passengers arriving or leaving the UK must prepare for the special measures.

The teams working on the checks will have been hired by the airlines themselves, not by the airport, but the Department for Transport has insisted all will be fully qualified security staff.

If, for whatever reason, your device fails the security check, you will be forced to leave your device behind, and may even be banned from taking the flight itself.
