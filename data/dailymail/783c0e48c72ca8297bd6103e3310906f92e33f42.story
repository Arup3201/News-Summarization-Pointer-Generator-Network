As fury grows over a report that Joe Paterno helped to cover up child sex abuse claims against Jerry Sandusky, one company is going above and beyond to make sure a statue of the late Penn State football coach is no more.

A plane was spotted over State College on Wednesday towing a banner that read 'TAKE THE STATUE DOWN OR WE WILL.'

The banner referred to a monument to Paterno, who coached the team for nearly 50 years before he was fired in disgrace last year at the height of the sex abuse scandal.

Taking flight: The banner appeared over the State College on Wednesday, as furor grows over Paterno's role in covering up the Sandusky scandal

The bronze sculpture bearing Paterno's likeness has been sitting in front of Beaver Stadium since 2001.

The Centre Daily Times reported that the company that operates the plane, Air America Aerial Ads, is no stranger to controversial messages.

The Federal Aviation Administration grounded a plane from the Genoa, Ohio-based company after it towed banners taunting Tiger Woods during the 2010 Masters golf tournament.

Those banners read: 'Tiger: Did you mean Bootyism? (in reference to the golfer's claim that he was turning to Buddhism to help him get through his cheating scandal)' and 'Sex addict? Yeah. Right. Sure. Me too'

James Miller, who said he was the one flying the plane, would not name the person or group who funded the ad, telling the paper: 'I advertise. I believe in freedom of speech.'

Penn State spokeswoman Lisa Powers told the Centre Daily Times that the university was aware of the high-flying banner, but were powerless to stop it.

Ms Powers told the paper: 'Any restrictions would, of course, have to come from the [FAA]. There's not much action we can take related to this expression of opinion, but we are monitoring it.'

An independent investigation led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh 
released a report last week that concluded Paterno and other top Penn 
State officials hid Sandusky's abuse to shield the university
from bad publicity.

Paterno died of lung cancer on 
January 22, less than three months before he was dismissed from the Penn
State sidelines for good.

The new revelations about Paterno 
have led to intense public backlash against the former coach, whose 
firing was once widely thought to be unfair.

Also on Tuesday, the group that runs the parking area dubbed 'Paternoville' where students camp out for tickets before games has stripped that title and changed the name to 'Nittanyville.'

The Penn State student group that 
manages the newly-renamed fan area said that their decision would help 
‘return the focus to the overall team and the thousands of students who 
support it.'

On its 
website, they chose to remain diplomatic in their reasoning, saying that
'since it was unlikely another coach would stay as long as Coach 
Paterno had, changing the name for each new coach would be impractical.'

The most significant change, however, may be yet to come as the president of the NCAA says he isn't ruling out the possibility of shutting down the entire Penn State football programme in light of the Sandusky case.

Getting rid of all traces: Since a scathing report which detailed how much former football coach Joe Paterno (pictured) knew about the child sex scandal, his name is being pulled from much of the school

In a PBS interview on Monday night, NCAA President Mark Emmert said he doesn't want to 'take anything off the table' if the NCAA determines penalties against Penn State are warranted.

Mr Emmert said he's 'never seen anything as egregious as this in terms of just overall conduct and behaviour inside a university.'

He added, 'What the appropriate penalties are, if there are determinations of violations, we'll have to decide.'

The last time the NCAA shut down a 
football program with the so-called 'death penalty' was in the 1980s, 
when SMU was forced to drop the sport because of extra benefits 
violations.

Legacy: Paterno was heralded around the campus for years, but now the NCAA is debating shutting down the football program entirely in the wake of the report

After the NCAA suspended the SMU program for a year, the school decided not to play in 1988, either, as it tried to regroup.

'This
is completely different than an impermissible benefits scandal like [what] happened at SMU, or anything else we've dealt with. This is as 
systemic a cultural problem as it is a football problem,' Mr Emmert 
said.

'There have been people that said this wasn't a football scandal. Well, it was more than a football scandal, much more than a football scandal. It was that but much more.

'We'll have to figure out exactly what the right penalties are. I don't know that past precedent makes particularly good sense in this case, because it's really an unprecedented problem.'
