For decades, researchers have been trying in vain to decipher ancient texts written on the Voynich manuscript - yet they may have been looking for inspiration in the wrong place.

A U.S. botanist studied illustrations of the plants throughout the 15th century book and pinpointed a number of them to the region now known as Mexico.

Dr. Arthur Tucker claims at least 37 of the 303 plants would have grown in the region during the 15th and 16th century and believes the text is, therefore, written in the Aztec language of Nahuatl.

Stephen Bax, Professor of Applied Linguistics at the University of Bedfordshire, say he has decoded words in it for the first time by identifying the plants

Nahuatl originated during the 7th century. It was the spoken predominantly by the Aztecs.

Following the Spanish conquest of Mexico in the 16th century, the alphabet was replaced with Latin.

Nahuatl became a literary language, used in poetry and passages, similar to the Voynich manuscript.

Varieties of Nahuatl are still spoken by approximately 1.5 million Nahua people in Central Mexico.

The writing is so bizarre, sceptics have stated the book is a hoax or that the writing is nonsense.

The Voynich manuscript was discovered in an Italian monastery in 1912 by book dealer Wilfred Voynich.

Carbon dating suggests the manuscript was created between approximately 1404 and 1438, during the Italian Renaissance.

The 240 pages of the book are made from a type of parchment produced using calf skin, known as vellum, and are decorated with illustrations, diagrams and a mysterious text written from left to right.

Examples include the illustration of the Ipomoea murucoides, top left, taken from the Mexican Codex Cruz-Badianus which has an identical style to the Ipomoea arborescens in the manuscript, bottom left. A Voynich illustration of a cactus pad or fruit, right, is shown near the name ‘nashtli’, which Dr. Tucker and Talbert claim is a variant of the word ‘nochtil’ - the Nahuatl name for the fruit of the prickly pear

If the text, pictured far left, is written in the language of Nahuatl, the botanists claim they can find the name of the plants in the manuscript. From this, cryptographers may be able to form a basic code from which to crack the rest of the text in the 15th century book

Due to its mysterious nature, the text has been studied by cryptographers around the world, yet no-one has succeeded in deciphering the reams of written passages.

Dr. Arthur Tucker from Delaware University took a different approach, and instead, studied the plants depicted throughout the book.

He discovered similarities between specific plants in the manuscript and illustrations of plants he had spotted in his collection of 16th century Mexican records.

Carbon dating suggests the manuscript was created in the early 15th century, between approximately 1404 and 1438, during the Italian Renaissance. 

The 240 pages of the book are made from a type of parchment produced using calf skin, known as vellum.

Each page is decorated with illustrations, diagrams and a mysterious text written from left to right.

Due to its mysterious nature, the text has been studied by cryptographers around the world, yet no-one has succeeded in deciphering the reams of written passages. 

This has led to many people claim the book is hoax, or that the writing is nonsense.  

Due to the manuscript’s discovery in Italy, many researchers believe the book to have originated in Europe, however, the latest research from Dr. Tucker suggests it may have been written by the Aztecs in what is now modern-day Mexico. 

For example, Dr. Tucker and fellow researcher Rexford Talbert said one plant in the book bears a resemblance to the picture of a soap plant (xiuhamolli) seen in a Mexican codex from 1552.

While another example includes the illustration of the Ipomoea murucoides, taken from the Mexican Codex Cruz-Badianus, which has an identical style to the Ipomoea arborescens in the manuscript.

In total, the researchers linked 37 of the 303 plants in the manuscript to illustrations in ancient Mexican books covering botany across Texas, California and Nicaragua.
