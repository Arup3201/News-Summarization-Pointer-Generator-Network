A Koala was found outside a police station at Victoria with $50 in its mouth

A dead koala with a $50 note stuffed inside its mouth has turned up on the doorstep of a Victorian police station, baffling the officers inside.

Police from Heywood station, in the state's south west, stumbled upon the dead koala at the entrance to the station at about 10pm on Saturday without any clue of how it got to be there.

A police spokesperson said an officer heard the 'ruffling noise' of the note and went outside to check on what it was, before noticing the koala with money in its mouth.

They said the koala was found dead on discovery, and it appeared it was hit by a car before being taken to the police station.

'It was not known how it was killed or why it was left there. At this stage, we are not treating it as suspicious,' the spokesperson said.

There was also no CCTV footage of the incident, and police could not explain why there was $50 lodged inside its mouth.

He said there seemed no plausible way the koala could have picked the note up on its own, 'unless eucalyptus leaves were being made out of $50 notes now.'

'We don't know if this is a message someone wanted to send to police.'
