Red wine drinkers are wealthier, more educated and happier than average people - but lovers of white wine are more practical, a study revealed today.

The research found that it was possible to generalise about drinkers based on their favourite tipple, with those who like a glass of red being ambitious go-getters while people who prefer white are more relaxed and happy-go-lucky.

And rosé drinkers are the unquestioned kings and queens of social networking, visiting sites such as Facebook multiple times every day on average.

Ambitious: Red wine drinkers are well-educated and career-oriented

Those who drink red wine are more likely to have a degree, be married and drink more frequently than those who have a preference for white or rosé.

White wine drinkers are home-lovers who enjoy a holiday in the UK and are content with their position on the career ladder.

A spokesman for French Wines with Style, which commissioned the report, said: 'They say you can tell a lot about someone from their favourite tipple, and it seems that it is definitely the case when it comes to wine.

'From the study it looks as though those with certain personality traits are drawn to certain styles of wine.'

The survey of 2,000 adults looked into everything from earnings and career prospects to personal attributes.

Laid-back: White wine drinkers are content with leading a simpler life

More than half of red wine drinkers are university graduates, and they typically earn between £40-45,000 per year.

And while 81 per cent are currently 
happy at work, 65 per cent are still highly ambitious and want to scale 
higher up the career ladder.

Red wine drinkers:

Earn £40-45,000

Are happily married

Holiday abroad

Confident, relaxed, strong, intelligent

Drink four glasses a week

White wine drinkers:

Earn £25-30,000

Are happily single

Holiday in the UK

Practical, bright, shy, quiet

Drink three glasses a week

In comparison, a white wine drinker pockets around £25-30,000 per year, with just 43 per cent having attended university.

And most are not very interested in 
the corporate ladder, with more than two fifths admitting they are 
really not that ambitious.

55 per cent of rosé fans leave school by the age of 18, and they go on to earn around £30,000 on average.

Happily in an unmarried relationship

Enjoy social networking

Loud, warm, charming

Drink two glasses a week

As well as being the wealthiest segment 
of society, red wine drinkers are the most likely to be happily married,
 as 86 per cent say they are content with the state of their 
relationships.

While white wine buyers are less likely to be hitched, 85 per cent of those who are single claim they are happy with their solo status.

A quarter of those who enjoy a glass of red take around three overseas holidays a year, with a third also taking three or more mini breaks in the UK on top of that.

White wine drinkers are more likely to holiday in the UK rather than travelling to far flung corners of the world.

When asked to describe themselves, red wine drinkers are most likely to use words such as confident, relaxed, strong and intelligent.

White wine drinkers tend to say they are practical, bright, shy, quiet and reserved.

Rosé drinkers like to describe themselves as loud, warm and charming.

The study also found that it is the rosé drinker who adores Facebook, averaging 146 friends and 13 visits to the site each week.

But red wine drinkers have a greater enthusiasm for 'real' versus 'virtual' friends, and only log onto social networks such as Facebook eight times in an average week.

Red wine drinkers average four glasses of their preferred wine a week, white wine fans have three while rosé drinkers average just two glasses of wine a week.
