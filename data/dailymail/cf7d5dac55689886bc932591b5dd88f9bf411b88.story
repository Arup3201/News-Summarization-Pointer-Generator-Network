Jo Swinson yesterday launched a scathing attack on society’s ‘obsession with women’s role as mothers’ - which she branded a ‘Call the Midwife’ view of parenting.

The junior equalities minister was speaking at an event on ‘what women voters want’, where she came under pressure to provide financial support for stay-at-home mothers.

Miss Swinson, who is married to a fellow MP Duncan Hames and gave birth to their first child last year, said the Lib Dems had driven a ‘revolution’ by pushing for flexible hours and shared parental leave of up to a year. She said the Government had also taken steps to increase tax-free childcare for working parents.

But she added: ‘The very idea of men caring for small children or mothers forging successful careers is anathema to many Tories, who’d apparently rather have a Call the Midwife version of parenting. At least we recognise that women might want both a fulfilling job and family life.

‘With a paltry two weeks of paternity leave and popular culture that brands dads as hapless and bumbling, men are written out of the family script with worrying regularity.’

However after her speech, several audience members raised concerns about full-time mothers being ignored by politicians.

Karen Wilkinson, a party member who has been a stay-at-home mother for ten years, said the Lib Dems should consider ways to ‘level the playing field’ for full-time parents who ‘pay a high price’ in lost income.

She went on to say: ‘Not only do stay-at-home parents care for their children but they often provide the glue that makes a neighbourhood a community and undertake much voluntary work supporting working parents and older people.

‘For this they pay a very heavy price in lost income, lower self-esteem and significantly reduced opportunities for future employment and pensions. So can we please consider policies to level the playing field, not just insist on pushing people back into work.’

And Lib Dem activist Elizabeth Jewkes told Miss Swinson that stay-at-home parents should be given around £40 a week – the sum they would be entitled to tax-free if they worked. She revealed that she had suggested the policy to Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander earlier this year, but said he was ‘only interested in helping working parents’.

Speaking about her proposal, she said: ‘This would give mothers and fathers at home a value, and not just people with children but others with caring responsibilities. Many people only do this for a couple of years and then go back to work, but it’s a really important thing to do.’

Miss Swinson said she would be interested in seeing details of the plan to help stay-at-home mothers, but added: ‘It’s pretty expensive to do so and that’s the big challenge.’

Miriam Clegg last night declared: ‘I want to have what men have’ – as she set out the case for women to combine family life with a career.

The high-flying mother-of-three said women feel pressured to choose between having a job and having children.

Mrs Clegg, who prefers to be known by her maiden name Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, told the BBC: ‘I am asked all the time do you want to have it all, and I don’t want to have it all – I want to have what men have.

‘So if many men have children and a job, and that’s what they choose, I do not know why I cannot have that, if that’s what I choose.’ Mrs Clegg, who earns a reported £500,000 a year as a partner at international law firm Dechert, has spoken out in the past about the need for men to take more responsibility for childcare.

Earlier this year she suggested that fathers who look after their children have ‘more cojones’ and has hit out at ‘dinosaurs’ who believe the issue should be left to women, saying that caring for children ‘does not affect your level of testosterone’.

Speaking yesterday, Mrs Clegg also said it was ‘crucial’ for women who want to work and have a family to choose their husbands carefully. But in an interview with Sky News, she admitted that not all women wanted to work while their children were growing up, saying: ‘There will be other women who don’t want that.’

Unlike her husband, she was seen wearing only two different outfits yesterday. Mrs Clegg chose jeans, shoes from Zara and a red printed top from Spanish brand Dolores Promesas for a visit to a school. She later changed into a beige dress and bright orange shoes for her husband’s question-and-answer session.
