These stunning photos look like scenes from a make-believe magical kingdom from the hit Disney film Frozen.

But they were snapped inside a real-life lair of ice by an intrepid photographer who was forced to abseil inside Iceland’s Breidamerkurjokull glacier.

Nicolas Brousse’s effort was well worth it as he emerged from the popular tourist spot with breathtaking photos of an emerald blue world.

Nicolas Brousse captured incredible scenes while exploring the interior of the Breidamerkurjokull glacier in south-east Iceland

It looks like the interior of a make-believe kingdom from the hit film Frozen, but the ice cavern is a popular destination for tourists

This image of an entrance to the ice cavern, snapped by Nicolas Brousse, makes it appear as though the sea is parting

The 27-year-old Frenchman’s snaps reveal intricate patterns and stunning colours, including black layers of volcanic ash, that make the rippled ceiling look like crystal and the icy floor look like a pane of glass.

Nicolas' group went on the thrilling expedition with an experienced guide, and he used natural light as well as his camera’s flash to capture his incredible photos.

Breidamerkurjokull is an outlet glacier of Vatnajökull, or the Vatna Glacier, which is one of the largest ice caps in all of Europe. There are several volcanoes located under the ice cap.

Nicolas, who now lives in Malmo, Sweden, captured the images as he spent six months traversing Iceland and exploring its amazing scenery.

Being able to see the changes in the seasons was an amazing experience, he said.

‘The light, the clouds and the atmosphere are always changing and in six months I never saw the same landscape twice. Inside the cave, the atmosphere is magical.

‘The most amazing is the colour and the smooth shape of the ice - the blue colour is clear without any editing and is amazing.

‘The black layers of volcanic ash trapped inside the ice is what makes Icelandic glaciers special - it creates beautiful black veins inside the ice.’

While he exploring the cave, Nicolas and his guide passed through a narrow galerie created by a stream that flows through the glacier in the summer time.

He said: ‘The curvy shape of the tunnel and the blackness of it was really beautiful, and I knew it would make really nice pictures.

The intrepid photographer and his group had to abseil into the glacier in order to explore the icy paradise inside

‘In my work as a photographer I try to focus on the magnificence of what I experience in nature.

‘My goal is to show beauty as I perceive it and as it touches my feelings.

‘I am also a landscape architect and I so I am always observing the environment.’
