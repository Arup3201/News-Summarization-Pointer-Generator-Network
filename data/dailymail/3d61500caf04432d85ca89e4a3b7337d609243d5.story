NBA legend Shaquille 'Shaq' O'Neal has prompted outrage by apparently posting an Instagram photo which mocked a man with a rare genetic condition.

Jahmel Binion, whose ectodermal dysplasia hinders his ability to grow teeth and hair, was dumbfounded when thousands of internet users imitated and mocked a selfie he took.

They included Shaq, who has now apparently deleted the Instagram photo - which said 'SMILE TODAY' - and uploaded one comparing himself to the cartoon ogre Shrek.

Offensive: The photo was uploaded to the Instagram account of Shaquille O'Neal (left) comparing him to Jahmel Binion (right) - who has the rare genetic disorder ectodermal dysplasia. It has since been deleted

But the move was too late to stop a storm of comments from many of Shaq's 500,000 followers on Instagram and 8.3million on Twitter.

The controversy comes after criticism of another top figure in basketball, billionaire LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who is embroiled in a racial discrimination row.

Many Instagram and Twitter users today demanded Shaq apologised for the photo.

And instead of hiding away, 23-year-old Mr Binion has used the publicity to start a campaign to raise awareness of his condition.

Called Hug Don't Judge, a Facebook page for his campaign has gained more than 3,500 fans and been flooded with photos by parents whose children have the same disorder.

The description reads: 'This page is to support my anti-bulling and cyber bullying organization.

'Please be respectful, be positive and share this with the world. Time to make a difference.'

Mocked: Jahmel Binion (left) had ectodermal dysplasia since he was a baby (right) and has begun an anti-bullying campaign. He said he was disappointed by the NBA star because he saw him as a role model

Mr Binion, 23, told My Fox Detroit: 'I've been getting teased since I was yea tall - people laugh at me, stare at me.

'I
 was kinda hurt because I look up to him and I watch Shaq play 
basketball so I was like, why is he making fun of me when he's supposed 
to be this role model?'

'I can't let it get to me, then I get hurt and depressed, so I keep my mind positive.'

The storm prompted the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias to write an open letter to the NBA legend.

Executive
 director Mary Fete said there were more than 180 forms of the condition
 and many left sufferers with missing teeth and unable to sweat.

She wrote: 'You might want to consider
 making something positive come from this.  Consider giving Jahmel 
Binion the gift of a smile, one that others would not make fun of.

'Give him a smile that would give him confidence and pride.'

Self-mockery: The four time NBA champion has since uploaded a photo comparing himself to Shrek

So far Shaq has not responded publicly to the row.

Some
 users rushed to the 7ft 1in four-time NBA champion's support, saying 
people were too easily offended and Shaq may not have known Mr Binion 
had a disibility.

Anger: One Twitter user's response today

The controversy comes after another top figure in the NBA, billionaire LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, made headlines when a tape of an alleged racist rant was leaked to TMZ.

He is allegedly heard telling his girlfriend she can 'sleep with black people' but not bring them to matches.

'You can bring them in, you can do 
whatever you want,' the voice on the tape says. 'The little I ask you is not to promote it on that... 
and not to bring them to my games.

'It bothers me a lot
 that you want to broadcast that you’re associating with black people. 
Do you have to?

'I’m just saying, in your lousy f******* Instagrams, you don’t have to have yourself with, walking with black people.

'Don't
 put him (Magic Johnson) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they 
have to call me.  And don't bring him to my games.'

In 2009 Sterling agreed to a $2.76 million settlement over claims he discriminated against African American and Latinos tenants at apartments he owned. He did not admit any liability.

Campaign: Jahmel Binion's anti-bullying Facebook group Hug Don't Judge has already gained 3,500 members

Response: One of the reactions which the NBA star received to the row from his 8.3million followers

Politics: Another user highlighted the NBA star's support for New Jersey 'Bridgegate' governor Chris Christie

Abuse: Some Twitter users were more angry and one called Shaq a 'sad pathetic excuse for a man'. Others, however, defended him saying he may not have known Jahmel Binion had a disability

Dear Mr. O’Neal,

All of us at the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias (NFED) are terribly disappointed by the hurtful image that you and others recently posted on social media about a member of our family, Jahmel Binion, who is affected by ectodermal dysplasia.

Individuals affected by these rare, genetic conditions often face a lifetime of bullying and negative remarks because of their appearance, which others may consider “different.”  Bullying is never acceptable and we, as a nation, have had some devastating consequences as a result of bullying. However, to be called out on a celebrity’s social media and made fun of is especially reprehensible.  We applaud Jahmel for reacting to this cyberbullying by establishing a positive social media campaign called “Hug Don’t Judge.”

Mr. O’Neal, we welcome this opportunity to enlighten you about the ectodermal dysplasias and how we could work together for positive change.

The ectodermal dysplasias are rare genetic conditions that affect the development of hair, teeth, skin, glands and nails in men, women and children of all races and ethnic groups.  Of the more than 180 different syndromes, x-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) is the most common and features multiple malformed and missing teeth, the inability to perspire, sparse hair and recurring respiratory infections. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, but in all cases present a variety of challenges.

We invite you to attend our NFED National Family Conference, July 23-26 in Columbus, Ohio, and meet families from around the world who, like Jahmel, are affected by ectodermal dysplasias.  You will meet some extraordinary people who are accomplishing profound acts despite the harsh social stigmas, daunting physical challenges, and financially draining dental procedures they’re up against.

You might want to consider making something positive come from this.  Consider giving Jahmel Binion the gift of a smile, one that others would not make fun of.  Give him a smile that would give him confidence and pride.

We are urging our NFED community to use this opportunity to raise awareness, to make positive change, and to support Jahmel’s “Hug Don’t Judge” campaign (#hugdontjudge). We encourage you to do the same.  Let’s raise awareness of the ectodermal dysplasias. Together, we have the power to make life better for the people it affects.

Beauty is diverse. Let us show you.

Sincerely,

Mary FeteExecutive Director
