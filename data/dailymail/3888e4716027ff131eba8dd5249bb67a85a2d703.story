Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger admits it's unrealistic to expect his side to catch unbeaten Chelsea at the top of the Premier League any time soon but suggests comparisons between his 'Invincibles' side and the current Blues team are far too premature.

The Gunners registered two wins last week, defeating Anderlecht 2-1 in the Champions League before beating Sunderland 2-0.

However Wenger's men remain nine points behind leaders Chelsea ahead of hosting Burnley on Saturday.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger insists his side can catch league leaders Chelsea... but not soon

Diego Costa has scored nine goals in as many games since joining Chelsea, who are top of the league

'Chelsea are in a strong position at the moment,' Wenger told the Evening Standard. 'I believe it would not be realistic to just think now that we'll catch back Chelsea very quickly.

'We have to get consistent results to get a chance to come back. Personally, I'm more focused on the quality of our games and on the consistency of our results, before we think about coming back on Chelsea.'

Jose Mourinho's side have started the Premier League season unbeaten which has led to early comparisons with Arsenal's undefeated campaign of 2003-04.

However Wenger feels that is too premature: 'It is nine games played. There's a long way to go. It's too early.'

Arsenal last won the league title back in 2004 but Wenger maintains his side are still contenders.

'I don't write us off, let people do it,' added Wenger. 'That is a little bit linked with mathematics. It doesn't consider who we've played, how many times we played away, the quality of the team we played against, what missing players we had for the big games.

'That is absolutely normal but I have a strong belief we will come back and we can just prove that on the pitch.
