Health officials in Ohio are monitoring more than 100 people following the visit by a Dallas nurse who tested positive for Ebola shortly after returning to Texas from the Cleveland area.

Officials stressed Saturday that none of those being monitored are sick.

State officials had announced on Friday that 16 people Amber Vinson had contact with were being monitored.

Officials say the sharp increase is a result of the identification of airline passengers who flew with Vinson between Dallas and Cleveland and the identification of people who also visited the dress shop where her bridesmaids were trying on dresses.

Vinson's stepfather remains quarantined in his home in the Akron suburb of Tallmadge - where Vinson stayed during her trip - and is the only person in the state under such restrictions.

Getting serious: The new Texas Department of State Health Services document that healthcare workers with possible exposure to Ebola are being asked to sign in the wake of the Amber Vinson containment issue

Passengers aboard two flights that Ms Vinson took have been told to monitor themselves for signs of the deadly virus for 21 days over fears that Ms Vinson was contagious both when she flew from Dallas to Cleveland on October 10 and when she returned to Texas on Monday. 

The plane that Ms Vinson was in made five flights loaded with passengers before the CDC notified Frontier that she may have been contagious. 

The airline is now trying to contact its passengers who flew on plane number N220FR, an Airbus A320, before it was removed from service. The plane made flights to Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and back to Cleveland. 

WKYC-TV reports that more than 800 passengers are affected by the notice.

Passengers who were on the October 10 Frontier Flight 1142 from Dallas/Fort Worth to Cleveland and passengers on Monday's Flight 1143 from Cleveland to Dallas/Fort Worth have been asked to call the CDC and monitor themselves for symptoms. 

The passengers on the other flight are not thought to be at risk for the disease, but Frontier is notifying them anyway. Those flights are:

Despite the widening crisis, health officials have stressed that the risk to everyone - the passengers aboard Ms Vinson's plane, the people she came in contact with in Ohio and especially those who flew on her plane on later flights - is minimal. 

Officials also stressed that none of the people being monitored have contracted the virus. 

CDC Dr Chris Braden revealed during a press briefing on Thursday: 'We had started to look at the possibility that she had symptoms going back as far as Saturday.

'This has to do with the bridal shop. Some more information that has come through recently says we can't rule out that she might have had the start of her symptoms on Friday.' 

Seven people in Cleveland and Akron have put themselves in voluntary quarantine after coming into contact with Miss Vinson, including five friends whom she shopped with for bridesmaid dresses at bridal store, Coming Attractions, in Cleveland.

The news has prompted high schools and medical centers in Ohio to send home staff and students amid fears that they could have come into contact with the nurse.

Miss Vinson remained in her home for the three days she was in Cleveland, except for one trip to a bridal store with  friends - but authorities are pressing her further on her movements. 

The store's owners have voluntarily closed while CDC officials investigate the level of risk.

The owner of the store told Newsnet5 that Miss Vinson didn't seem sick  when she visited to pick out dresses. 

The 29-year-old is now being treated at Emory in Atlanta, Georgia where she was described as being in a stable condition.

Miss Vinson was taken by chartered plane from Dallas to Atlanta Wednesday night, where she is currently being treated at Emory University Hospital

She was airlifted from Dallas, Texas on Wednesday evening on a specialized plane with quarantine unit, along with medical staff in hazmat suits.  

Miss Vinson was one of the nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to treat Duncan when he was admitted a second time on September 28, in the first 'high-risk' days when there is a high volume of bodily fluids from projectile vomiting, bleeding and explosive diarrhea.   

According to CDC guidelines, the nurse should have limited her movements. 

It is not clear if Miss Vinson called the CDC before boarding her flight from Dallas to Cleveland.

The first nurse diagnosed was 26-year-old Nina Pham (right) who was in 'good condition' at Texas Presbyterian Hospital on Thursday

Damage control: Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital is currently monitoring more than 75 health care workers who came into contact with Duncan during his stay. On Wednesday, the hospital announced it would be offering free rooms to these staff members, who may not want to risk infecting their family members

Before her return flight on Monday, the nurse noticed a spike in her temperature and called the CDC several times to see if she should get on the plane.

When she finally got through to a CDC representative, she was cleared since her 99.5F fever was beneath the 100.4 threshold.

CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden admits that was the wrong call.

Dr Frieden also noted that Miss Vinson had flown to Ohio before the first nurse with Ebola, 26-year-old Nina Pham from Fort Worth, was diagnosed with the virus.

Miss Pham was described as being in a 'good condition' today.

She is being transferred to a special isolation ward at the National Institutes of Health Hospital in Maryland.
