Every Hull City player can claim to have defied the odds as he strides on to the Wembley pitch on Saturday, but none more so than David Meyler.

Not so long ago, Hull’s former Sunderland midfielder was unsure he would be striding anywhere, after a challenge with Manchester United full back Patrice Evra left his career hanging in the balance.

As he lay on the turf at the Stadium of Light in 2010, medical staff had to administer oxygen before stretcher bearers were able to carry him off.

Serious: Meyler was carried from the pitch on a stretcher after rupturing a cruciate ligament against Manchester United in 2010

Scans revealed a ruptured cruciate ligament, and after operating on him, Bradford-based surgeon Steve Bollen spelled out the possible consequences.

‘Never mind kicking a ball, he told me I might never walk properly again,’ Meyler, 24, reflected.

The worst-case scenario was avoided after a gruelling nine-month rehabilitation, but he was left  fretting over his future once more when the same knee buckled beneath him against Aston Villa in 2011.

Again, he had to be carried off, and while the diagnosis proved less serious, it is little wonder he intends savouring every moment of Hull’s attempt to upset favourites Arsenal.

‘After the first one, I was told I might never walk properly again, so you can put that in context, alongside possibly playing in an FA Cup final,’ he said. ‘I don’t know yet whether I will be in the team, but  to have the opportunity would be fantastic, just remarkable for me and my family.

‘It will be some day out, and I believe we are going to win it. Please God we do. It was 2010 and then 2011, the injuries. A long time ago now, but you don’t forget.

‘I made a right mess of my leg with the first one, and I knew I wouldn’t be right for a long time. It was  that bad. The second one felt like someone had broken my fingernail, by comparison.

Confident: Meyler believes Hull have what it takes to beat Arsenal on Saturday

‘When you spend a total of 18 months out injured, it is never nice. Just being able to train every day is something I relish and enjoy now, and when I look at a couple of players in our squad who have been out injured, I can sympathise with them. I have been there. I know what you are going through. Keep working hard, and with the physios here, who are top lads, you will get back.’

Meyler went on to insist there was no malice in the incident involving Adnan Januzaj at Old Trafford that could have cost him his Wembley place. He trod on the Manchester United midfielder’s shin but escaped punishment from the FA.

‘It could have been taken the wrong way, but it was an accident in the sense that it was clumsy from me,’ he said.

Unlucky: Meyler says Januzaj's speed was the reason he ended up standing on his leg at Old Trafford

‘I was tired, it was the 90th minute and Januzaj was too quick for me. My leg is in the air, he’s kicked the ball away and as I’m coming to plant my foot to push off, I’ve ended up accidentally standing on him.

‘Of course, there was worry and anxiety. Sometimes things can be taken the wrong way or over the line, but it is all done and dusted now and I can look forward to the Cup final.’

Meyler knows what it is like to  be on the end of a controversial incident; he was the victim of Alan Pardew’s headbutt earlier in the season. Pardew apologised to Meyler straight after the game and, he says, ‘that was the end of it’.

The 24-year-old from Cork has  blossomed under Hull manager Steve Bruce. He described the sales pitch that persuaded him to follow  manager Bruce from Sunderland to Hull: ‘When I spoke to him, he said, “Meyler, I want you to come and be a part of this”. I said, “How do I know you are going to be promoted?” So he just said, “Trust me, I will get this team promoted”.

‘And within one year he did. You’ve got to give him credit for that. It just goes to show what a great  manager he is.’
