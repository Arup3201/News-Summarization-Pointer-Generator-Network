A new activewear line uses crab and shrimp shells to prevent odor, fading, pulls and wrinkles.

Strongbody Apparel garments are treated with Chitosante, environmentally friendly and nontoxic antibacterial nanotechnology from the ocean to make the fabric more breathable and moisture wicking. Most importantly though, it makes each piece of clothing odourless.

Vancouver-based personal trainer Quincy Samycia, who founded the company with girlfriend Meghan Conyers, told MailOnline: 'We ended up loving the Chitosante technology, as its performance is unbeatable and the fabric keeps its original feel and drape.

Fishy business: Strongbody Apparel garments are treated with nanotechnology made from crab and shrimp shells which prevents odor, fading, pulls and wrinkles

 ‘Chitosante is anti-microbial, and when combined with the fabric it kills the bacteria which is actually what causes the odor on our clothing.'

The couple launched their label because they thought that the current activewear available was either unfashionable, not functional, or both so they took matters into their own hands.

Mr Samycia continued: 'We were inspired to start Strongbody as we wanted to create something we were comfortable enough in to workout, as well as walk our dog and grab a coffee - all while looking good. That's our lifestyle, and we couldn't find anything that did that for us.'

Mr Samycia and Ms Conyers have been self-funding Strongbody Apparel so far, but recently turned to Kickstarter for funding.

Giving back: Strongbody Apparel is ethically sourced and environmentally friendly - each piece is made and designed in Vancouver and with each purchase the Mr Samycia and Ms Conyers have pledged to donate to non-profits like World Food Program to help fight hunger 

 The company has already surpassed it's $15,000 goal by over $5,000 and still has over a week left before its December 4 deadline. Backers can receive discounted shirts, hats, and hoodies depending on pledged amount.

And, not unlike footwear company, Toms, there is a philanthropic element to the Strongbody Apparel business model too.

The 'Buy One, Feed One' program means that each time a customer buys a product, Strongbody Apparel gives funding to non-profit organizations that specialize in feeding underprivileged children.

Mr Samycia said: ‘The company strives to 'make a product that is better for the world and the customer.

'We want to change the mandate of corporations, and prove that it is possible to build a great business that also has great business practices.'
