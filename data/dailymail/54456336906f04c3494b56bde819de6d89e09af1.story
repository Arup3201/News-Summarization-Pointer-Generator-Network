Sir Alex Ferguson was a surprise visitor to Chelsea's Paris hotel on Tuesday morning ahead of their Champions League clash with PSG.

The former Manchester United manager was captured outside the five-star luxurious L'Hotel Du Collectionneur where Jose Mourinho and his men are putting the final touches to their preparations for the match against the French champions.

Le Parisien tweeted a picture of Sir Alex, 73, chatting with a bell boy outside the building close to the famous Arc de Triomphe.

The French newspaper reported that Mourinho had spoken with 'distinguished guest' Ferguson this morning.

Despite many battles during Ferguson's time at Old Trafford the men are known to be close.

Sportsmail understands Sir Alex is in Paris for a Uefa meeting which is why he was not at Deepdale on Monday night as United overcame Preston North End to set up an FA Cup quarter-final meeting with Arsenal.

Chelsea face PSG at the Parc des Princes at 7.45pm on Tuesday evening in a last-16 tie first-leg.

They will be boosted by the return from suspension of in-form striker Diego Costa although John Obi Mikel is a doubt with a knee injury.

In 2014, Ferguson was appointed Uefa's coaching ambassador and chairs meetings for Europe's 'elite' coaches.
