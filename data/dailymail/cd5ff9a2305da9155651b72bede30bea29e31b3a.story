Hibbard had first been diagnosed with prostate cancer 12 years ago but only revealed it publicly in 2008. 

His health is thought to have taken a turn for the worst eight weeks ago and he was admitted to hospital. 

Hibbard, born in Ebbw Vale, South Wales,
worked as a teacher, steel worker, barman and chimney sweep, before 
forming the acapella group the Flying Pickets.

They had a huge hit with Only You, with it spending five weeks at the top of the chart and won the coveted Christmas number one slot in 1983.

Tributes: Colleagues and friends took to Twitter to pay their respects

His agent confirmed his death yesterday and tributes were paid to a 'great man and lover of life' by his friends.

This afternoon friends remembered Hibbard, making his name trend over Twitter, many paying tribute to his great sense of humour and enormous talent.

Fellow actor Boyd Clack, who starred in Twin Town with Hibbard, told BBC Wales he first met Hibbard 28 years ago in a Theatr Clwyd production.

He said: 'Within two days of meeting him, he'd shown me his naked bum. He was a bit of a character all right.

'He was also fantastic actor, fantastic singer and a fantastic man. He was an old-fashioned socialist [who] was caring and kind. He did a huge amount of work for charity over the years.

'He was an honest person. He supported the miners during the strike; he supported every cause.'
