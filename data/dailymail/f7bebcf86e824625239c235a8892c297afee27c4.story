AC Milan have a list of candidates to replace Liverpool-bound Mario Balotelli, which includes Radamel Falcao and Jackson Martinez.

Corriere dello Sport says that a fee of €20million has been agreed between Milan and Liverpool and Balotelli will sign a four-year deal with Brendan Rodgers' side. 

His departure, although welcomed by many in Milan, would leave a gap at the focal point of the club's attack and the owner Silvio Berlusconi has apparently set his sights on Monaco forward Falcao and Porto's Martinez. 

Options: Mario Balotelli heading to Liverpool on a four-year deal while Berlusconi dreams of a big replacement

Were it to materialise, Falcao's transfer might leave a bitter taste in the mouths of some Liverpool fans as the Colombian had been their primary target.

La Gazzetta dello Sport also says goodbye to Balotelli and lists Martinez, Allesio Cerci and Adrien Rabiot as possible replacements. 

According to reports in Tuttosport, Juventus have offered Paul Pogba a new contract worth €4.5m a year plus a €1m bonus.

Towards the end of last season there was considerable speculation surrounding Dani Alves's future.

But the Brazilian has hit out in Mundo Deportivo, saying that he has a contract until 2016 and he does not intend to leave Barcelona. 

The full-back also said if the club's directors were in doubt about his position they should have told him. 

He said he should be criticised for what he does on the pitch, not what fans and the press accuse him of off it.

Supercopa: Bothy Marca and AS are focused on the clash between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid

Both Marca and AS look ahead to the Supercopa match between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid. 

Marca focuses on the fact that real Madrid can overtake barcelona on the number of titles one - both teams are currently tied on 78.

AS, meanwhile, says that Atletico manager Diego Simeone faces a selection headache as he decides whether to use the same team as last time or play Antoine Griezmann from the start. 

Return: Didier Descamps says the door is open should Franck Ribery wish to return to international football

Finally, in an interview with L'Equipe, Didier Deschamps says that the door will always be open if Franck Ribery wants to make a return to international football. 

The same courtesy is not, however, extended to Manchester City's Samir Nasri.

The French paper also notes that PSG striker Edinson Cavani is 'under the microscope' as numerous clubs around Europe consider making a bid.
