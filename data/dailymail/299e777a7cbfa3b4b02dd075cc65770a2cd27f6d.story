Last season's best two under-21 sides shared the points in a pulsating match in west London, with both sides pushing hard for the win before settling for a draw.

Manchester United fielded Tyler Blackett and Tom Thorpe, both of whom have seen first team football under Louis van Gaal, together at centre back as both looked to put their case that they can be trusted to fill the crisis position at Old Trafford.

But they were both upstaged by another central defender, as Andreas Christensen's header earned Chelsea a share of the spoils.

There were few chances in an even first half, a Lewis Baker free kick comfortably saved by Ben Amos the closest either side came in the first half hour.

Chelsea began to come into the ascendancy late in the half, and could have gone ahead in the final few moments, Ruben Loftus-Cheek heading wide from an Isaiah Brown cross. 

But moments after the break it was United who took the lead. Ola Aina was adjudged to have handled Saidy Janko's cross deliberately, and Will Keane stepped up to slot home.

United almost doubled their lead soon after, Tyler Blackett, who was on the bench for Van Gaal's side against Crystal Palace on Saturday, charging forward from the back but unable to convert a good chance.

And the visitors were punished for their wastefulness soon after, when Christensen headed from Baker's corner, having been left totally unmarked.

Both sides pushed for the win, but in the end a draw was the right result.
