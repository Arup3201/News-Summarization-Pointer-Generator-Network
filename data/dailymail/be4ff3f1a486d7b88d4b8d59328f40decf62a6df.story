The Republican-led House may have settled on a strategy to attack President Barack Obama's immigration 'amnesty' plan without shutting down the government, while giving tea party conservatives a way to vent their anger.

It's the 'CRomnibus' – not to be confused with the 'cronut.' The plan calls for a symbolic vote to de-fund Obama's executive actions on immigration, along with a hybrid budget plan that puts the White House's immigration authorities on a short leash. 

House Speaker John Boehner told lawmakers Tuesday to expect a straight de-funding vote this week. The Senate, still under Democratic control, would ignore the measure and the president would veto it in any event.

That would tee up a budget battle that's more about Republican infighting than the usual GOP-versus-Democrats squabbles.

House Speaker John Boehner told reporters on Tuesday about his attempt to strike a balance between conservatives determined to stop President Obama's immigration order and other lawmakers just as determined to avoid another politically damaging government shutdown

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testified Tuesday on Capitol Hill, insisting that lawmakers shouldn't hold his budget hostage to a D.C. war over immigration policy

The most recent 'Continuing Resolution' (CR) funding the federal government expires on Dec. 11, just as the outgoing Congress packs its things. House conservatives want to let it expire, or extend it for only a short time.

Moderates, including Boehner and other party leaders, want an 'omnibus' budget passed instead, funding the government through the end of next September when Uncle Sam's fiscal year ends.

They fear a showdown with Obama would bring another partial government 'shutdown' that the White House would successfully pin on them. Right-wingers, meanwhile, see that position as a white flag of surrender to Obama's immigration plan.

So, faced with a tea party caucus large enough to block an omnibus budget, Boehner is considering a plan that would give the party's right wing something to crow about while keeping the White House from going on the attack over a shutdown threat.

Enter the CRomnibus.

The latest solution to GOP infighting is a hybrid bill that would fund most of the government through September 2015 – all except for immigration authorities, which would get a three-month 'CR.'

That strategy would let Republicans gin up another battle in early 2015 when they control both houses of Congress.

'The cavalry is coming,' Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan promised on Tuesday during a monthly 'Conversations with Conservatives' meeting in Washington.

He argued that anything passed in the house should tie Obama's hands until January. 

'And then if Harry Reid and the Senate don’t pass that ... then let’s do something very short term,' Jordan said. 'Let's wait for the majority in the Senate to change.' 

Arizona Republican Rep. Matt Salmon told Roll Call that he believed, 'as many of the members do,' that Obama's immigration plan is unconstitutional. 

'So you just want me to fund the unconstitutional act for 60 days?' Salmon asked. 'Isn't that kind of like being a little bit pregnant? No, that doesn’t work for me.'

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who will lose his leadership perch in January, signaled his support for the idea, calling it 'a big accomplishment if we could get a bill over here that would fund all the appropriations subcommittees except for one.'

'I think it's kind of unfortunate that they're talking about not doing Homeland Security but that’s the way it is,' he told reporters on Capitol Hill.

The White House also expressed disappointment with the option currently being considered by Congress on Wednesday but restrained itself from issuing a veto threat.

Repeating previous assertions that the White House would like Congress to pass a budget that funds all areas of the government through the end of the fiscal year, the president's spokesman said today that Republicans should refrain from adding 'unnecessary ideological riders' to the current budget legislation.

'There will be ample opportunity for Republicans, next year, when they have control of both the House and the Senate to pursue any number of ideological ideas that they may want to codify into legislation,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said.

'There's no reason they should attach them to a budget proposal,' he added.

Republican Majority Leader-elect Mitch McConnell will meet with Obama at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the budget plan, among other issues, but the White House was unwilling to provide reporters insight on that meeting during Wednesday's briefing. 

CATBIRD SEAT: Obama is wagering that Republicans won't risk losing their Election Day luster by threatening to shut down the government in order to stop his executive 'amnesty' order 

While Democrats seemed willing to accept the current plan, Senate conservatives are itching for a fight.

'The Chairman of the Republican Party made a promise to America on executive amnesty: ‘We can’t allow it to happen and we won’t let it happen… everything we can do to stop it we will,’ Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions recalled Tuesday.

'Unfortunately, the plan now being circulated in the House fails to meet that test.'

Sessions objects to the 'CR' part of the 'CRomnibus' proposal, arguing that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Enforcement should be left twisting in the wind entirely.

'Congress must respond to the president’s unlawful [immigration] action by funding the government but not funding illegal amnesty,' he said. 'This is a perfectly sound and routine application of congressional authority.' 

In the House, Boehner faces a tough challenge: how to give outraged tea party conservatives a toothless outlet to vent over Obama's unilateral move to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants without permission from federal lawmakers.

A symbolic vote to de-fund USCIS's planned ramp-up of green cards and work permits would be one solution.

'We're looking at a number of options in terms of how to address this. This is a serious breach of our Constitution,' Boehner told reporters on Tuesday.

'It's a serious threat to our system of government, and frankly we have limited options and limited ability to deal with it directly.'

Johnson could find himself on a short leash for a few months if the 'CRomnibus' plan goes into effect

Publicly, the speaker said no decision had been made. But aides and lawmakers said he indicated during a closed-door meeting with the rank and file that a vote on legislation to block Obama was the leading option.

It would be on a bill by Florida Republican Rep. Ted Yoho, aimed at blocking Obama from unilaterally allowing categories of unlawful immigrants to live and work here.

Party leaders then hope to move on next week to voting on must-pass spending legislation to keep the government running.

In the wake of their midterm election victories last month to win full control of Congress, Republican leaders are eager to show they can govern responsibly. But Obama's administrative moves on immigration and the resulting GOP fury has created complications. 

Some outside conservatives were quick to register opposition, arguing that the approach would do nothing to stop Obama's plans stripping away the money to carry out the policy.

'If conservative members agree to this plan, they are just as complicit in Obama's amnesty as everyone else.  Don't be fooled, once this budget bill passes the amnesty will be irrevocable,' wrote Daniel Horowitz, a columnist for the Conservative Review.

Meanwhile Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson defended Obama's new immigration plans before a House committee where Republicans took turns denouncing them as an unconstitutional power grab that would incite a new rush of illegal immigration at the border.

'The president's unilateral actions to bypass Congress undermine the Constitution and threaten our democracy,' said Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.

'We will see a wave of illegal immigration because of the president's actions.'

Johnson disputed that point and others, arguing the president acted within his executive authority to temporarily defer deportations for certain immigrants who are not priorities for removal anyway.

The actions apply mostly to people who've been in the country five years or more and have kids who are citizens or green card holders.

'I'm fully comfortable that we have the legal authority to push forward these reforms,' Johnson said. 

'Deferred action is an inherent executive branch authority that can and should be used from time to time, and we've done so here.'

The spending measure the House will vote on next week will top $1 trillion and fund the day-to-day operations of cabinet agencies through the Sept. 30 end of the 2015 fiscal year. 

Johnson spoke out strongly against putting his Homeland Security Department on a short-term budget, saying it could prevent him from funding needed priorities including hiring protection for presidential candidates heading into the 2016 elections.
