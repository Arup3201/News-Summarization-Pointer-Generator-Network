She dreamed of the bright lights of the  West End.

But Jessica Holman’s ambitions of being a professional dancer were shattered after a horrific fall during a dance routine on a cruise ship.

The 23-year-old was told she would never dance again when she was dropped by her partner while in the splits position, severely damaging her hip.

She says the fall, which severely damaged her hip socket, could have been prevented if her dance partner had been removed earlier

Miss Holman is now suing the holiday 
company Celebrity Cruises, claiming her dance partner was not 
‘seaworthy’ and she received inadequate medical care for her injury.

The accident has meant she is in debt from paying for treatment and has since been diagnosed with depression.

She said: ‘The whole experience was traumatic. It’s absolutely ruined my life.

The
 doctors and managers didn’t take me seriously. I was disposable to 
them. When I was told I wouldn’t be able to dance again I just broke 
down completely. I had dreamed of being a dancer all my life.’

Miss Holman was two days into a South American cruise when she fell in October 2010.She said of her partner: ‘I was on his shoulders.

‘He
 was supposed to lower me down slowly on to the floor but he just 
dropped me on the stage. The pain took my breath away. I knew straight 
away that something was wrong, but I didn’t know how serious it was.’ 

Miss
 Holman was given  ibuprofen, but it was over two weeks before she was 
sent for an X-ray in Columbia and an MRI scan in Mexico.

She was only
 sent home to Stockport, Greater Manchester after a month and in 
agonising pain.

Miss Holman claims there were no painkillers or ice 
available after the fall and that the ship’s doctor repeatedly sent her 
back out to dance. 

She was diagnosed with torn cartilage in her 
right hip and despite having had two operations. doctors have said she 
could still need a hip replacement in her 40s.

Nearly four years 
after the incident, Miss Holman, now working as a receptionist, still 
struggles with the fact she will never dance again.

 She said: ‘I am stuck in a dead-end job with no career and no prospects. Just climbing stairs is a challenge. 

‘I have scars from all the surgery – and looking at them is a constant reminder of my broken dreams.’

A
 cruise company spokesman said: ‘Celebrity Cruises denies claims made by
 Miss Holman that she was made to dance when injured and will respond to
 any legal allegations in the relevant forum.’

After the cruise Ms Holman tried to retrain as an air hostess but the long-haul flights were too painful

After flying home, doctors told her she had a serious 'labral' tear - affecting the cartilage in her hip joint. She's since had two major hip operations, one to totally remove the cartilage, and needs another
