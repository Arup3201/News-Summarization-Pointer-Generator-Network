Australian racing legend Mark Skaife's luxurious family home in the exclusive Melbourne suburb of Toorak is on the market, and it could be yours for if you have a spare few million dollars in your back pocket.

Boasting five bedrooms, four bathrooms, three car spaces and - fortunately - a large driveway, Skaife shared the mansion with his wife Toni and their three children, according to Property Observer.

Purchased for $2.93 million dollars under wife Toni's name in 2009 the solid brick home features open plan living areas, is behind security gates and spans multiple levels.

Skaife currently shares the mansion with his wife Toni and their three children but they are looking for somewhere new

The rooms inside the house are spacious with high ceilings, providing plenty of room for furnishings and the opportunity to convert some of the spaces into a study area.

Real estate company RT Edgar boasts the place features: 'fabulous parquetry flooring and generous room sizes all flooded with an abundance of natural light from the preferred Northern orientation offering five bedroom accommodation.'

All bedrooms are located on the second floor, with the modern 'Caesar stone kitchen' and living areas, plus dining and study on the ground level.

'A double garage and carport accommodate three cars in comfort, remote front gates provide perimeter security and heating and cooling throughout', are also among the selling points for the home.

Outside a sprawling paved outdoor living area with heated in ground pool set into the large yard would be perfect for entertaining.

Located in Melbourne's 'premier suburb' the house is close to High Street and Glenferrie Road shopping, as well as being located near schools and transport. It will go to auction later this month.
