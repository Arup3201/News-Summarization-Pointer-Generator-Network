The Danish Prime Minster who took a selfie with David Cameron and Barack Obama at Nelson's Mandela memorial has been left to head a minority government after a small socialist party quit Denmark's coalition government.

They left the coalition amid discord over plans to sell a stake in state-controlled Dong Energy to Goldman Sachs and other investors.

The other two parties in the center-left government back the sale but the Socialist People's Party was split on the issue.

After more than a year of infighting,
 party leader Annette Vilhelmsen resigned today and the party withdrew 
its six ministers from the 23-member Cabinet.

The
 move weakens Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt's coalition but it's
 expected to stay on as a two-party minority government because it still
 has the support of the socialists in Parliament.

Obama, Cameron and Thorning-Schmidt were
 captured taking the picture at the FNB Stadium near Johannesburg, as thousands of mourners gathered to pay tribute to Nelson 
Mandela.

Thorning-Schmidt did not reveal whether she would delete the image or just refrain from showing it to the public.

Speaking to Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet, she said: 'It isn't a particularly good picture.'

She defended the selfie saying that the trio of world leaders were just 'having a bit of fun'.

The selfie led to a backlash from Twitter users who said it was inappropriate behaviour at an event to remember the life of the anti-apartheid hero

The Danish Prime Minister has enjoyed a glamorous reputation in her native country since being elected in 2011

She added that the relaxed picture was in-keeping with the spirit of the event.

The Dane, who is married to former Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock's son Stephen, 42, has enjoyed a glamorous reputation in her native country since becoming prime minister in 2011.

She said: 'There were lots of pictures taken that day, and I just thought it was a bit of fun.

'Maybe it also shows that when we meet heads of state and government, we too are just people who have fun.'

In an interview with Danish Daily Berlinske, she added: 'There was a sadness, but it was basically a festive event that also celebrated a man who has lived for 95 years and achieved so much in his life.

'There was dancing on the stands. And then we took a really fun selfie.'
