The British man who died on an Air Algerie flight which crashed in Mali has been named as maths teacher David Morgan.

Mr Morgan, who taught at an international school in Zambia, was one of 116 victims who died when his flight from Burkina Faso to Algeria crashed on Thursday.

Tributes to Mr Morgan were posted online today by fellow teachers. One, Andy Vasily, said: 'RIP Dave Morgan. Truly tragic. Prayers to his family and other victims.'

Tributes: Mr Morgan, a secondary school maths teacher, was remembered fondly by friends including  Hanri de Swardt, who posted this picture online

Another, South African Hanri de Swardt, said: 'Rest in peace Captian [sic] Dave Masher Morgan. Thanks for all the support and help in Lusaka. You will always be in my thoughts. God bless.'

Soldiers today recovered the black box of the plane in the hope of finding out what caused the crash. Terrorism has not been ruled out, though officials say bad weather is the most likely cause. 

Mr Morgan taught secondary school children at Lusaka International School in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. He is thought to originally be from Liverpool.

Teacher: Mr Morgan is thought to have taught at several international schools, with more than 15 years' experience

He worked at the school for two years, and taught his last lesson in June before breaking up for the holidays. Posts on social media suggest he was about to move to Singapore.

He has also worked at schools in Istanbul, Turkey, and Nanjing, China.

Mr Morgan joined Lusaka International School in 2012. A newsletter from his first term written by the head teacher said: 'It gives me immense pleasure and excitement to welcome, on behalf of the ISL community, new teachers who have joined us this year...

Yesterday David Cameron said he was 'deeply saddened' by the death of the British national.

The Prime Minister said: 'Thoughts very much with friends and family.'

Earlier yesterday, a Foreign Office spokesman said: 'It is with deep regret that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirms the death of a British man onboard Air Algerie flight AH 5017.

'We are providing consular support to his family at this tragic time, and we ask that the media respect the privacy of those grieving.'

Mr Cameron has also written to French president Francois Hollande 'to send sincere condolences for the loss of so many French citizens', Downing Street said.

Earlier, Mr Hollande said that French soldiers had secured one of the black boxes from the aircraft.

Wreckage: Soldiers from neighbouring Burkina Faso were today pictured standing over the plane's wreckage

Mangled: The plane. travelling from Burkina Faso to Algeria, came down near the border with Mali

It was recovered from the wreckage in the Gossi region near the border with Burkina Faso, and is being taken to the northern city of Gao, where a French military contingent is based 

'There are, alas, no survivors,' Mr Hollande told reporters following a crisis meeting with senior ministers. 'I share the pain of families living through this terrible ordeal.'

Nearly half of the passengers aboard the flight were French, many due to head on to Europe after arriving in the Algerian capital Algiers from the Burkina Faso capital, Ouagadougou.

Mr Hollande has said that France will spare no efforts to find out what happened.

Cause unknown: It is not yet clear why the plane came down, though bad weather is the most likely cause

'There are hypotheses, notably weather-related, but we don't rule out anything because we want to know what happened,' the French president said.

Interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said: 'Terrorist groups are in the zone. ... We know these groups are hostile to Western interests.'

The MD-83 aircraft, owned by Spanish company Swiftair and leased by Algeria's flagship carrier, disappeared from radar less than an hour after it took off early on Thursday. It had requested permission to change course due to bad weather.
