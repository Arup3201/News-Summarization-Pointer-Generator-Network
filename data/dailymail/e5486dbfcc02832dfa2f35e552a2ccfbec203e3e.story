Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot who killed 150 people when he is believed to have deliberately crashed a plane into the Alps, could have killed more if he had realised his dream to fly larger planes for long haul flights. 

Lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the Germanwings A320 Airbus into a rocky ravine of the Alps, locking the pilot out of the cockpit as he put the plane into a descent - killing all 149 people on board and himself.

The 27-year-old was said to be a keen glider and an ambitious pilot, with hopes to continue his career by handling larger planes that carried hundreds of passengers.

Andreas Lubitz was an ambitious pilot who wanted to fly even larger planes, such as a Boeing 747 which carries almost 700 passengers, and could have ended in tragedy for even more people 

Fellow pilot Frank Woiton flew with Lubitz three weeks ago and said he was confident with his performance to leave him in charge of the controls. 

He told German newspaper Bild: 'He talked about his training and how happy he was. He said that he wanted to fly long-haul and become a captain. He had mastered flying and was in control.' 

Mr Woiton, who comes from Lubitz's home town of Montabaur, said the young pilot had told him he dreamed of flying Boeing 747s and an Airbus A380. 

Boeing 747 planes are large capacity aircraft, often referred to as a jumbo jet. They have a maximum capacity of 660 passengers. 

Airbus A380 are also considerably larger than the 180-capacity doomed A320 jet that Lubitz flew. Standard A380 planes carry 544 passengers but larger versions can carry up to 800.

Recordings from the one recovered black box have revealed the final moments of the plane, as the pilot desperately tried to get back into the cockpit after being locked out by Lubitz.

A fellow pilot revealed that Lubitz also wanted to fly an A380 airbus - which carries more passengers 

Captain Patrick Sondheimer apparently screamed ‘Open the goddamn door!’ as he tried to break down the door and get into the cockpit. His shouts are followed by screams from passengers, according to a transcript published in Bild.

Investigators are trying to determine what led Lubitz to deliberately crash the plane, with a torn up sick note for the day of the crash, and medication found at his home suggesting he was suffering with psychological problems. 

He is also believed to have been struggling with apparent vision problems and was concerned it could affect his dream job as a pilot. 

Members of the Red Cross and residents living close to the site of the crash paid tribute to those killed

Lubitz is believed to have sought help with his vision problems as recently as March 10. Police have revealed they found evidence at his home to suggest he suffered from a serious 'psychosomatic illness.' 

His former girlfriend described him as an erratic and controlling man, who would frequently wake up with nightmares. 

In a chilling premonition she said he once told her ‘One day I will do something that will change the whole system, and then all will know my name and remember it.’

As a child, Lubitz is said to have always wanted to be a pilot and covered his bedroom walls with pictures of planes and collected model aircraft.

He is also said to have visited an airfield just 30 miles from the site of the tragic crash with his gliding club as a child.

Among the 150 victims of the crash were 16 German children from the same exchange class at school and three Britons - one of which was just seven months old. 

German officials have announced there will be a ceremony on April 17 in Cologne Cathedral attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and senior officials from other countries including France and Spain.
