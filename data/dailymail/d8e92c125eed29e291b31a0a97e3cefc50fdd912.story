A 7-year-old Chinese boy dying from cancer and abandoned by his mother says he wants to see her one more time before he loses his sight.

Ren Shihao, who has a brain tumour, told a local reporter in China's southwestern Sichuan province that he doesn't blame his mother for leaving the family, but added: 'I want to say I miss her. I want to say I love you mum. And I want her to hug me.'

Ren can only see a few centimeters in front of his face as the growth puts pressure on his optic nerves.

Ren Shihao's mother left the family before the 7-year-old was diagnosed with brain cancer but now refuses to come back as she has a new life with a different man. Here local volunteers play with Ren

The boy was diagnosed with cancer in September after his father, Cheng Li Ren, 35, took him to hospital when he began to feel ill.

Cheng said: 'I took him to the hospital where they diagnosed him as suffering from a medulloblastoma, a kind of malignant cancer on the brain, in September.

'He had been feeling ill from September and in May he began to stagger. But hospital visits are hard for us to manage, we only took him there in September and the cancer was diagnosed.

Doctor's in the regional capital of Chengdu operated on the growth, but by then it had already spread too far.

Despite the tragic events Ren says he doesn't blame his mother for leaving but would like to see her one last time before the tumour robs him of his sight. Local well-wishers are helping him to make a video appeal

After the failed operation Ren was sent back to his home in Yangyi village where local hospitals said they couldn't do anything for him and sent him home.

His father added: 'He is starting to lose his sight, he thinks he will go blind, but he does not know he will die eventually. He wants only one thing, to see his mother before he loses his sight.'

Ren's mother, Li Sun, left the household after arguments about money following his birth.

Both parents had been forced to leave their village to work in the city, and Ren was raised by his grandmother, Zhao Yonglian.

But the strain that put on the relationship was too much, and eventually Li kissed him goodbye and left.

Cheng has since tracked her down, but she is in a new relationship and refuses to come back to see her dying child.

He said: 'I never married her, and I left my son and managed to track her down, and discovered she now has a new life with a new man where she is married, so she has refused to come and see her son that we had.

'I guess her new family do not know of her previous life.'
