Guilty: Ian Ousey leaving Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court today after he admitted defrauding the makers of the X Factor of £225,000

A former executive at the company behind The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent is facing jail after stealing £225,000 to buy a Mediterranean holiday home.

Ian Ousey, who was chief financial officer at television production company FremantleMedia, siphoned off funds by submitting false invoices between 2008 and 2012 to make payments on a property in Corsica.

Ousey, 51, was caught only when senior colleagues noticed huge shortfalls in the company’s finances and launched an audit. 

Probes were also made over suspected bogus claims on Ousey’s company credit card, but the matter was dropped when investigators failed to distinguish legitimate claims from potentially fraudulent ones.

He has since paid back the full amount he stole, as well as £1million to cover the cost of FremantleMedia’s internal inquiry.

He is also believed to have surrendered his full pension to the company.

Yesterday, Ousey, who lives in a £1.9million five-bedroom detached home in Ascot, Berkshire, was warned he could be facing a prison sentence after pleading guilty at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court, North London, to fraud by abuse of position involving £224,754.

Defence solicitor Samuel Parish said Ousey, who has children in private school, began taking money from the company accounts when he could not afford payments on the holiday home.

He told the court: ‘He’s been to Corsica with his wife, he’s decided to buy a property which he had to pay for in instalments.

‘At the last stretch there was some hiccup and he was unable to make the final instalment. The conditions were such that if he was unable to pay he would have lost the whole lot.

‘He submitted a false invoice for a company that did not exist but which had a similar name to a company that did supply to [FremantleMedia].

‘He’s stated that he couldn’t stop, but he’s paid everything back.’

FremantleMedia, which co-owns The X Factor and Got Talent franchises with Simon Cowell, also makes other popular TV shows such as Take Me Out and Grand Designs.

Mr Parish added: ‘This matter came to light as a result of Mr Ousey making a statement to his employers and he paid back every penny, including investigation costs getting on for £1million.

‘He’s a man with children in paid schools, and his whole way of life has gone completely.

‘He can’t get a job, he’s had to inform his professional body and has been struck off their rolls.

‘And now what he is most worried about is the welfare of his family, because he’s left them in really difficult circumstances.’

Suspicious transactions, which also involved the company credit card as well as bogus invoices, were discovered in 2012 by FremantleMedia’s group financial director Mark Riddleston.

The company credit card was also used to pay for vehicles, mobile phones and other unauthorised expenses.

Ousey, who graduated in economics and statistics from the University of Exeter, spent more than a decade in senior finance roles in the TV industry.

He trained at accounting firm PwC in the 1980s before taking a job in Monaco with Grundy Worldwide, the Australian production company behind Neighbours, the long-running daytime soap opera.

Ousey then went on to work for the European entertainment giant RTL when it bought out Grundy, and then FremantleMedia when the companies merged.

After leaving the company last year, he was made redundant from a rival firm in April and then worked as a self-employed consultant.

On his online social networking LinkedIn profile, he describes himself as ‘a highly experienced CFO, with a reputation for significant contribution to the business, and delivering the best commercial outcome’.

Ousey was released on conditional bail, which included handing the court his passport, and will be sentenced at Blackfriars Crown Court at a date yet to be set.
