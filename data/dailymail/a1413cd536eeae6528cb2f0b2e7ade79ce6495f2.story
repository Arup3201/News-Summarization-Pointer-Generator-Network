A set of iconic costumes worn by the von Trapp family in the hit film The Sound of Music has emerged for sale for £150,000 pounds.

The collection includes 14 outfits from the celebrated 1965 musical which starred Julie Andrews as a nun who teaches the children of a widowed Navy officer to sing.

The highlight of the set is a uniform worn by Christopher Plummer as Captain Georg von Trapp in famed songs ‘So Long, Farewell’ and ‘Edelweiss’.

Famous moment: Christopher Plummer starred as Captain von Trapp. He wore this costume in the scene where Von Trapp leads his family to safety over the mountains and away from the Nazis

Tight-fitting: A jacket worn by Charmian Carr who played Liesl von Trapp, the first and eldest child, who sings 'sixteen going on seventeen'

Record breaker: The Sound of Music, which starred Julie Andrews, pictured centre, was the highest grossing film ever at the time

Also included are five of the seven Von 
Trapp children’s outfits from the same numbers and two capes worn by the
 childen in ‘Climb Every Mountain’.

The Sound of Music was the 
highest grossing film ever at the time, earning almost £200million 
and knocking Gone with the Wind off the top spot.

The film was
 based on the 1959 Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical which in 
turn was inspired by the true story of spirited young nun Maria von 
Trapp.

The film, which won five Oscars, produced classic songs like 
‘Edelweiss’ and ‘My Favorite Things’ and made Julie Andrews a superstar.
