Arabic sign: A post in Zell am See in Salzburg where leaflets are being handed out to Arab tourists

Salzburg has been accused of ‘tourism apartheid’ after distributing a leaflet to Arab visitors advising them to stop them trying to haggle over prices, cooking in their rooms, and dumping litter.

The eight-page etiquette guide, called ‘Where Cultures Meet’, also explains how children need to wear seatbelts in a car, meals should not be eaten on the floor, and advises guests to adopt the Austrian mentality and not wear burkas.

The pamphlet, in association with tourism officials, the police and the Austrian Arabic chamber of trade, is handed out to visitors in the resort of Zell am See, regarded as one of the most picturesque and expensive of Austria's tourist destinations.

Located in the Kitzbuhel Alps, the town is the number one of the country's lakeside destinations on the edge of the 223ft deep Lake Zell.

The move comes in response to complaints from locals and companies about the way the Arab guests behave, but the region does not want to give up the tourism revenue, which in the past 10 years has increased by several hundred per cent.

However, many business owners disagree with the leaflets. 

Hotel owner Wilfried Holleis said he said he had no problem with Arab guests and that the whole discussion was a sign of the intolerance in the area. 

He added: ‘I see it as a kind of tourism apartheid.

Popular destination: Last year there were 275,000 overnight stays by Arab guests in the Zell am See-Kaprun region

‘I think there are much more serious problems here, for example the number of people who don't spend any time here but buy property which is effectively just a holiday house and therefore make little or no contribution to the local economy.’

According to the latest statistics, last year there were 275,000 overnight stays by Arab guests in the Zell am See-Kaprun region – about 25 per cent of total visitors.

They also spend £195 per person per day – double the level of other tourists.

Tourism spokesman Renate Ecker said: ‘They often stay for several weeks, also at times when it's not so busy and in contrast to guests from other regions they are always delighted when it rains.

‘Some hotels depend so much on the Arab guests that they have almost no other visitors and even have cooks specially employed to cater to Arab taste.’

She added 
that the sceptical attitude of locals was a real cause for concern, 
adding: ‘If locals find a stumbling point to accept Arab guests, then 
that means trouble for tourism.’

Local mayor Peter Padourek said tourists wearing the burka was the biggest reason for friction in the area.

He
 said: ‘Here the Arabs have the problem that their strong presence in 
the region is very clearly visible because of the burka.

The Where Cultures Meet guide also tells Arab tourists not to cook in hotel rooms

‘That causes irritation among locals and among visitors from other countries. 

‘The guests are coming from other countries carry away with them a different image of our region.’ 

He also said that he was noticing increasingly that signs were being put up in Arabic and that didn't make him happy. 

He said: ‘I don't like it when we sell ourselves in this way. We don't need to cosy up to anyone with gestures like this. We should limit ourselves to German and English.’

It is not the first time friction has been seen between Austria and guests from Arabic regions.

In 2012 the Austrian Times reported that the regions tourism officials had cancelled all advertising for the Middle East.
