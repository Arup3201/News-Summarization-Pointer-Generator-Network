England won so many medals at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow — 174 in all and 58 gold, comfortably the most of the 71 competing nations — that it was easy to become complacent.

‘Oh look, we’ve picked up another one in the lawn bowls’.

The nation topped the medals table in boxing, diving, gymnastics, triathlon and judo, where they were level with Scotland. England also came second in squash, cycling, table tennis, hockey, power-lifting, shooting and swimming.

The numbers are so mind-boggling it doesn’t seem to mean very much after a while (as long as England are ahead of Australia, of course). That is not to disparage the men and women who have stood proudly on the podium, for you can only beat the opponent in front of you, but such enormous success deserves some context.

FOUND the incessant noise about Usain Bolt deigning to rock up and run two relay legs in Glasgow annoying and disrespectful to other great Olympic champions, but he proved me wrong on Saturday. There is no showman in sport like Bolt — and how athletics needs him.

THOUGHT we are in a dangerous place when a positive test from a 16-year-old weightlifter — Nigeria’s Chika Amalaha — was heralded as a sign that sport is winning the war on drugs. It is not the teenager who should be hung out to dry for having a diuretic and a masking agent in her system, but those who helped her get them.

WATCHED live squash for the first time — and thought it was brilliant. Fast, feisty, demanding extraordinary levels of fitness and with equal medals on offer for men and women — how is it not an Olympic sport and golf is?

Will the might of the USA and China, who finished first and second in the medals table at London 2012, be losing sleep as they try and make sense of this slightly odd, antiquated 11-day festival of sport the British monarch rules over every four years? It is doubtful.

Nearly half of England’s medals came in the ‘optional’ sports at these Games; disciplines that a host nation can choose to include depending on how good they are at them, essentially. This seems an entirely fitting approach for a competition made up of countries that once belonged to the British Empire, mind you. We’re going to put on a rather nice sports day, but we’re only going to play the games we like. Now would you like some tea?

Judo, triathlon and gymnastics came into this category in 2014, but Glasgow could equally have picked ten-pin bowling or softball if they had really wanted to wind up their neighbours across the border. Thankfully, Scotland recognised that home nations success would sell, and the Games have been a better spectacle for it. But, as thoughts turn to the 2016 Olympics in Rio, rallying cries about Britain’s chances of success must be measured.

Daniel Keatings’ score to win gold on the pommel horse, for example, was the one gymnastics display that would have been worthy of a medal — bronze — at London 2012. There were four pairs entered for the men’s 10m synchronised diving event, so only gold and silver medals were awarded. The season’s bests which Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who missed the Games with a foot injury, set in 2014 would have been good enough to win the women’s heptathlon, high jump and long jump in Glasgow.

So many to choose from. I loved seeing Scots Hannah Miley, Eilidh Child and Lynsey Sharp defy the burden of home pressure to reach the podium. Equally thrilling was watching 40-year-old Jo Pavey take it to the Kenyans in the 5,000m, just 10 months after giving birth to her second child. What a gutsy display.

It is not realistic to frame these Games as the pinnacle of sporting achievement — we should celebrate them as an entertaining stepping stone. They can then keep the joyous peculiarities of a 79-year-old playing lawn bowls or a chap from the Solomon Islands being lapped three times in the 5,000m final and yet still retain their relevance.

It’s been thrilling to see home-grown youngsters grasp their opportunities with no Chinese, American or Russian competitors to get in the way, and then immediately talk of how these Games will be a springboard for future success. Think of 16-year-old gymnast Claudia Fragapane (left) and her four gold medals; Ross Murdoch, who beat fellow Scot Michael Jamieson to win 200m breaststroke gold; or sprinter Adam Gemili, who won two silvers.

It is athletes like these we should pick out when trying to make sense of that dizzyingly successful medal table. The brilliantly bonkers stories about the endless list of husband-and-wife partnerships are what make the Games unique, but these tales could also be its downfall if you start analysing the standard of some of the sports too closely.

The Commonwealths’ wonderful inclusivity — the thought that, actually, you could be capable of being on the Gold Coast in four years’ time if you could find a not-too-distant relative in Jersey — has played a key part in its success. But it is the platform it has provided for some of our stars of the future that will see it endure.

Justin Gatlin and Tyson Gay, two sprinters back after serving doping bans, were accused of ‘ruining the whole season’ by a fan on Twitter. Gay hit back, saying ‘OK lol’, while Gatlin’s advice was ‘turn your TV off then’. Both will run at the well-paid Diamond League circuit in Brussels in September.
