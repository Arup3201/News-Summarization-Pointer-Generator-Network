Manny Pacquiao works up a sweat on a Los Angeles basketball court as the pint-sized Filipino's preparations for his May 2 megafight with Floyd Mayweather ramp up.

In spite of his 5ft 6in frame Pacquiao is passionate about basketball and is even an occasional player-coach for the KIA Sorento team in the Philippine Basketball Association's league.

So a reporter probably should have known better than to bet Pacquiao he couldn't nail a three-pointer on a crowded court in his United States base.

The video journalist, Elie Seckbach, said he'd do 100 push-ups if the 36-year-old sunk a maximum from the corner of the court and was good to his word.

Pacquiao's shooting form up to that point was sketchy at best, with air balls as common as the sound of swish from the net, although he does sink a backwards shot from the free throw line.

On winning the bet, the pound-for-pound legend even stands over the reporter at one point to ensure his push-ups are up to the superfit boxer's standards.

Colourful reporter Seckbach has form in losing bets with Pacquiao having done the same back in 2010 when Pacquiao delivered a three-pointer in an organised local game.

'Manny Pacquiao - Do not bet him, you will not win,' he said after Pacquiao gave him a fist pump of approval after his push-ups were complete.

Pacquiao is attracting a crowd wherever he goes in LA, his base ahead of the richest fight of all time, whether it's shadow boxing in a park or shooting hoops.
