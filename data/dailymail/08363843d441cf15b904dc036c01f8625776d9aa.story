Some of us occasionally require two attempts to successfully park a car, but it rarely comes to this.

A side-splitting video of a woman who spent 30 minutes trying to parallel park her vehicle on a road in the Holyland area of Belfast, Northern Ireland, has gone viral on YouTube.

The clip, which was filmed on a mobile phone from a house window nearby and has now been viewed 1.1million times, was captured by a group of students who watched the drama unfold.

Side-splitting video: The woman was desperately trying to parallel park her car on a road in Holyland, Belfast

Hilarious commentary was provided by Ciaran Doherty and Ciaran Shannon along with some of their friends, and the video was uploaded until the title of ‘World's Worst Attempt at Parallel Parking’.

Ciaran Doherty told BBC News: ‘One of the boys in the house was looking out the window having a wee bit of fresh air and saw it. The next thing we were all at the window and looking out.

‘We were looking at it for a good 15 minutes before we started videoing it. I offered to park the car for her. I can't believe she couldn't get it in. It could easily have fitted a big people carrier.’

The students cheer when the woman starts to get to grips with the manoeuver, saying: ‘Go on, get her in, go on ye girl ye’ - before they start laughing when she starts trying to do a three-point turn.

They shout phrases such as: ‘Women drivers’ and ‘man she's nuts, she's turning too early’.

Mr Shannon said his friends thought the parallel park was funny and he decided to share it with them on Facebook as a joke - before there were 30,000 views by the next day.

Mr Doherty added that the students would love to meet the woman and ‘see her view of the story’.
