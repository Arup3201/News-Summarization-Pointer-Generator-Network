Castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga came face to face with his daughter for the first time in years in a Skype phone call, but the school girl was too shy to say anything and had to walk away from the computer screen.

Fatima, 13, has not seen her father since he left El Salvador in 2001 when she was just a baby and she was overcome with nerves during Friday’s video call.

Her grandmother – Alvarenga's mother – Maria described how the teenager had to step out of view of the camera because she couldn't think of anything to say to her long lost father.

Speaking to MailOnline from the family shop in the tiny village of Garita Palmera on the Pacific coast of El Salvador, Maria also said her 37-year-old son seemed a lot healthier and more mentally coherent than he had done a few days earlier.

She said: 'We had a Skype conversation with Salvador on Friday. He spoke to me and his father Ricardo and he wanted to talk to Fatima as well.

'She came in front of the computer so he could see her, but she was very shy and couldn't think of anything to say to him, so she had to walk away. It is very hard for her because she doesn't know him. This is very a strange situation for her.

'But it was good for us to see him. He looked a lot healthier and he was able to talk more. It seems like he is getting better, but he is not completely there yet.'

That was the second time Fatima has had the chance to speak to her father since he washed up on the Marshall Islands, claiming to have been lost at sea for more than a year.

MailOnline revealed they first spoke on the phone on Tuesday and again it was a slightly awkward conversation.

Fatima explained: 'Other than when I was a baby I have never met him or spoken to him. My grandmother passed the phone to me and I just said, "Hi" I did not call him dad.

'He called me, "daughter," asked me how I was and the said, "did you miss me?" I was shy and didn't really say much back. Then he said, "How old are you?" When I told him I was going to be 14 in April he said, "I will be with you soon, I will be with you for your next birthday."'

When she was asked how she felt about being reunited with him she replied: 'I will be happy to see him, but it will be awkward because I have never spent time with him.'

And her mother, Alvarenga's wife, Arely Barrera also seemed slightly underwhelmed by his imminent return, sarcastically telling MailOnline on Wednesday: 'Yes, he was really fun to be around.'

It is still unclear when Alvarenga will finally be reunited with his family as reports coming out of the Marshall Islands on Saturday suggested he was still too unwell to make the long journey.

His father Ricardo told MailOnline he had no idea when he would see his son. He said: 'We have not been given any timings or dates. We really do not know when he will be back. All we know is that he will be back with us eventually.'

Mr Alvarenga and his shipmate Ezequiel Cordoba, 25, set sail from the small fishing village of Costa Azul, in Mexico, in late 2012.

But strong northerly winds forced to the pair off course and they were left helplessly adrift at sea.

After four months, Ezequiel sadly died but Mr Alvarenga spent another 11 months in their small fishing boat before washing up on the Marshall Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, 6,000 miles from where he originally set sail.

The Salvadorian fisherman, who is known locally as La Chancha, now wants the boss from his fishing company to compensate him and Cordoba's family for what happened.
