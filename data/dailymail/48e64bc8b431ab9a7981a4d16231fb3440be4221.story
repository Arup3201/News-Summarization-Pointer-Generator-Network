Lady Natasha Rufus-Isaacs married Rupert 
Finch today at John the Baptist Church, Cirencester, which saw Cressida Bonas attend the ceremony without Prince Harry.

Also in attendance were Princess Eugenie, who arrived with boyfriend Jack Brooksbank, and Prince Michael of Kent.

Ms Bonas chose to wear a plain green 
jacket over a brightly patterned trouser suit, with her hair flowing freely, while Eugenie 
donned a vibrant floral dress topped with a white jacket and killer heels.

Eugenie also chose a classy black fascinator at the high-society wedding.

What stood out more so, however, was Ms Bonas' choice of footwear.

To accompany her flowing outfit, the Leeds University dance graduate wore pink platform shoes.

However, her choice of footwear may have played a part in a stumble on the cobbles, but Ms Bonas managed to regain her balance to avoid hitting the deck.

Rumours that Prince Harry's romance with Cressida Bonas is on the rocks will heighten after she was spotted alone at the wedding.

Stumble: Ms Bonas' choice of footwear may have led to her finding some difficulty in negotiating the cobbles in Cirencester

Harry is believed to be keen to marry and start a family, while Ms Bonas has told friends that she wishes to continue to pursue an acting career and hates the thought of being a 'trophy wife.'

Prince William and his wife the Duchess of Cambridge were believed to have been invited to the ceremony, but are not thought to have been able to attend.

Rufus-Isaacs is the founder of Beulah, London, and is a close friend of Prince William. Her lawyer husband is an ex-boyfriend of Kate Middleton.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had a tough decision to make this weekend, as they received invites to four high-society weddings involving friends.

As well as the nuptials for Rufus-Isaacs and Finch, the royal couple were invited to the marriage of William's mate Peregrine Hood, 37, and 28-year-old Vogue fashion editor Serena Nikkah’s wedding in Wiltshire.

And just to make their diaries even more
 complicated, today saw Nigerian oil heiress Emma McQuiston, 
26, become Britain’s first black marchioness when she headed down the 
aisle with the Viscount Weymouth, 38-year-old Ceawlin Thynn, at his 
family estate at Longleat in Wiltshire.

On the same day, the late James 
Goldsmith’s daughter Charlotte is getting hitched to designer Philip 
Colbert at a trendy affair in East London.
