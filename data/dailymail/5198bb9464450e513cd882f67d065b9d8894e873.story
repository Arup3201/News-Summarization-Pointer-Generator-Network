The father of Irish journalist Jill Meagher directly addressed his daughter's killer in an Australian courtroom yesterday, telling him: 'It's not okay to rape and murder my child'.

Speaking in a strong and steady voice, George McKeon read a heartbreaking victim impact statement to Adrian Bayley at this pre-sentence hearing in Victoria.

In stark contrast, the 41-year-old sexual predator cut a cowardly figure in the dock with his head bowed and refused to look Mrs Meagher's family in the eye.

The hearing was told how Bayley had been convicted of 22 rapes against six women and was on parole when he attacked the County Louth woman in September last year.

Now the premier of the Australian state 
of Victoria has ordered a full inquiry into how the serial rapist, who 
should have been in jail, was free to kill the 29-year-old.

The hearing also heard an account from her husband, Tom Meagher, who was too devastated to read his victim impact statement himself.

It told how his life was destroyed on the night Bayley attacked his beautiful young wife as she walked alone to her Melbourne home.

Bayley, now 41, was 18 years old when he raped his first victim – a 16-year-old friend of his own sister. And he has committed more sex crimes over the past two decades.

Mr Meagher told the hearing yesterday how he is still haunted by the fact he was not able to tell his 29-year-old wife that he loved her in her last moments.

The statement, read to the court by a 
spokesman, said: ‘The knowledge that those last moments were terrifying 
and painful and the knowledge that with her final walk she had crossed 
paths with evil haunts me every day.’

He
 said, ‘my love, my best friend and my entire world’ had been stolen, as
 well as ‘the possibility of a family and our lives together’. He added:
 ‘I am half a person because of this crime. I think of the waste of a 
brilliant mind... at the hands of a grotesque and soulless human being.’

Bayley
 has already pleaded guilty to the rape and murder of Mrs Meagher, after
 he attacked her in a lane in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick on 
September 22 last year, as she walked home after socialising with 
colleagues from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

The hearing at Victoria’s Supreme Court
 that Bayley had previously been found guilty of 21 rape offences and 
was on parole for attacking five prostitutes when he assaulted the 
County Louth woma in September last year.

In
 2002, Bayley was sentenced to 11 years for raping five prostitutes, but
 was freed on parole in 2011, which would have lasted until March this 
year.

In February last year,
 he was sentenced to three months for assaulting a man and should have 
been sent back to jail, but he appealed it and was released – enabling 
him to rape and strangle Jill.

Now the parole board has been criticised for not taking action just months before Bayley turned killer.

Denis
 Napthine – premier of the state of Victoria, where Melbourne is the 
capital – is ‘astounded’ that Bayley was free to roam the streets and 
has ordered an inquiry. He admitted: ‘There is no doubt the system 
failed Jill Meagher.’

In Mr McKeon's victim impact statement, he told hown which the 55-year-old told how his daughter travelled home to see him after he had a stroke last September.

He said she made him promise to get better as she wanted her children to have ‘a young granddad to run around with’.

He said: ‘Every young child, small baby less than three months old, they just remind me of Jillian and they remind me of what would have been, that by now, Jillian would be three to four months’ pregnant.’

Her mother Edith was unable to attend the hearing due to illness, but her statement was read out to the court.

She said: ‘My life stopped on September 22, 2012. I have been shocked to the core of my being. I can no longer live an ordinary life and my heart suffers from the deepest wound from which it will never recover.’

In court yesterday chief prosecutor Gavin Silbert told the judge that Bayley killed Mrs Meagher because he knew he would face a term of up to 20 years for raping her. ‘Accordingly, he [felt] he had no option but to kill her,’ Mr Silbert said.

But the court heard Bayley told a psychologist that after raping Ms Meagher, he held her down ‘for long enough to kill her’ because she retaliated and threatened to tell police.

‘It is much more likely that this was a rage-based response to what was occurring, as opposed to being a rational assessment of the need to dispose of a witness, if I can put it in that blunt and rather inappropriate way,’ defence counsel Saul Holt, SC, said.

In a letter read out in court, Bayley offered an apology. The claimed he was not seeking forgiveness and realised he deserved a sentence of life imprisonment.

However, his defence lawyer asked for a lenient sentence so that he could rehabilitate. But Mr Silbert said Bayley only confessed after he was ‘backed into a corner’.

Justice Geoff Nettle will sentence Bayley next Wednesday.
