Vale, the name of Savannah Guthrie’s one-day-old daughter, is already ‘trending’.

Pamela Redmond Satran, founder of baby name data site Nameberry.com, says that searches for the unusual moniker started picking up as soon as the newborn’s name was announced yesterday on the Today show.

She told Today.com that Ms Guthrie and husband Mike Feldman are likely to inspire many other new parents to choose the name too.

'I would expect a lot of people to follow suit,' she said. 'I think it’s a great name: it’s simple and everybody can understand it, but it’s really different and unusual as a name at the same time.'

Ms Redmond Satran says that Vale is currently so obscure that it's not even included on the Social Security Administration’s extended list of baby names - a name must be given to at least five or more babies in the U.S. each year to make the list.

She adds that Vale, an 'old-fashioned poetic term,' reflects two naming trends: place names and nature names (such as River or Forest).

'It’s kind of the anything-goes style of baby naming that has really emerged as parents look for names that both have personal meaning and are really different from what everybody else is named,' she said.

Vale Guthrie Feldman, the daughter of Ms Guthrie and her husband Mike Feldman, was born early Wednesday morning.

The Today host, 42, said: 'We had a few names on the girl list but we had not settled on it. Vale had always been on our list of names we had liked.

'We thought it was pretty, unique but not kooky or weird. . . I don't want to name names but there are some weird ones out there.'

Last month, Nameberry released a tally of the most popular baby names of 2014, based on the number of views each one attracted on the site. Pop culture was a major influence on the list, with many names inspired by movie and TV heroines and celebrity offspring.
