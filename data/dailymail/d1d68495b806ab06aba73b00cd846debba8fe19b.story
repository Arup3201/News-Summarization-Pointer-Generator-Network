A family are today celebrating the arrival of a baby boy, just months after losing another son to a rare heart condition.

Lucas Tasker was born just over two weeks ago.

But his arrival comes months after his parents Lois and Jason suffered a devastating loss when their 14-month-old son Oscar lost his battle for life.

The toddler became the face of a national organ donor appeal after he was born with the arteries to his heart wired the wrong way around.  

Lois and Jason Tasker from Coventry, welcomed baby Lucas two weeks ago. Four months earlier they lost their 14-month-old son Oscar after he was born with the main arteries in his heart wired the wrong way around

Mrs Tasker did not find out until three weeks before Oscar's sudden death that she was pregnant with Lucas, by which time she was already 17 weeks pregnant. 

'We looked back trying to find any signs, any symptoms, but there was nothing,' the 29-year-old from  Radford, said.

'I wasn't sick like I'd been with the other children - it was like the baby had been hidden from us.

'We didn't know how we would cope. We were the only two people who could look after Oscar and our first thought was how would we look after him.'

They struggled to come to terms with the fact there would be a new addition to the family with siblings Abbie, 12, Paige, 10, Ryan, eight, Milo, five and Lyam, four.

And with the gruelling demands of caring for Oscar and their other five children, the couple admit they even briefly considered abortion.

But they said now, they wouldn't change it for the world.

'Lucas is our gift from Oscar,' said his father, Jason, 34. 'It's like Oscar's been looking after us all.

'Having Lucas has helped us with the healing process.'

He said the first few days after Lucas's arrival were tough as they were constantly reminded of Oscar, who was born at Coventry's University Hospital with the main arteries to his heart the wrong way around, starving his body of oxygen.

He underwent two emergency seven-hour operations within 24 hours at Birmingham Children's Hospital and was placed on the organ transplant list and rushed to Newcastle's Freeman Hospital. 

Oscar had spent most his life in hospital, but seemed to have turned a corner when he was welcomed home for the first time to live with his five brothers and sisters before Christmas before his health sadly deteriorated again. 

Lucas has become one of the youngest organ donors registered on the national database, following in the footsteps of his siblings, Abbie, 12, Paige, 10, Ryan, eight, Milo, five and Lyam, four

Mrs Tasker, said: 'People might think our new baby must be some consolation but it hasn't been easy at all. 

'We found it quite hard as we used Oscar's clothes and toys but we've got our heads around it now.

'We just think that if Oscar was here we'd be using all that stuff.'

She faced a traumatic birth delivering Lucas at home as planned but encountering complications after her son was born. 

She was rushed to Coventry's University Hospital for an emergency procedure leaving her husband, a National Express driver, to fear the worst.

Now baby Lucas is among the youngest people on the NHS Organ Donor Register after being signed up when he was just a few days old.

'It's so easy to sign up,' Mrs Tasker said. 'You just go on the website. 

'All our children are registered. We couldn't expect to receive without doing this.'

The family remains passionate about organ donation and continues to raise cash for good causes in Oscar's name, including Zoe's Place Baby Hospice in Coventry and the specialist children's heart unit in Newcastle where Oscar received much of his treatment.
