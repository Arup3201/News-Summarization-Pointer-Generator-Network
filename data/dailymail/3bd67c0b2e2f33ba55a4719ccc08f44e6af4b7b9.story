A bitter argument has broken out over a city financier's plans to build a vast basement extension under the £11million home where Nobel Prize-winning writer John Galsworthy lived.

Caspar Berendsen, a private equity partner in city firm Cinven, wants to build a children's play room, TV room and sitting room underneath the home, as well as adding extra bedrooms.

But neighbours, who are already enduring building works at two nearby properties, have branded the new plans 'inhumane', with one long-time resident saying he will move if the work is approved.

The home, in Hampsted, was where Galsworthy wrote much of The Forsyte Saga, his epic series of novels and short stories for which he won literature's highest honour.

The author, who was educated at Harrow in West London, and then at Oxford, lived in the property from 1918 until his death in 1933.

While there Galsworthy added an extension to the already large property, giving it nine bedrooms. The building work would be knocked down as part of Mr Berendsen's plans.

Nobel Prize-winning author John Galsworthy, who wrote the Forsyte Saga, lived in the house from 1918 until his death from a stroke in 1933

Painter John Constable was fascinated by the house, including it in three of his paintings, including one from the early part of the 20th century named after the property.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, actor Tom Conti said: 'It is inhumane to inflict this dreadful noise and everything else connected to such excavation on the people living nearby.' 

He told the paper that residents had already endured years of noise from a nearby property belonging to former French footballer and Arsenal star Theirry Henry.

John Gardiner, 69, a tax barrister who lives next door to Mr Berendsen, said he will consider leaving him home of 30 years if the works are approved by Camden council. 

Galsworthy was the son of a wealthy solicitor of the same name, and after graduating with a law degree from New College, Oxford,he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1890.

After several years of following in his father's footsteps he decided that law was not for him, and instead began writing, publishing his first works under the pseudonym John Sinjohn.

In 1904 he first used his own name when publishing novel The Island Pharisees, and in 1906 the first work of The Forsyte Saga appeared, The Man of Property, which was harshly critical of his own upper middle-class background, and based party on his unhappy marriage to Ada Pearson.

Galsworthy then moved to Hampsted, where he published The White Monkey, The Silver Spoon, Swan Song, and interludes A Silent Wooing and A Passerby, all of which form part of the Forsyte Saga, alongside plays and other writings.

On Forsyte Change was the last volume in the saga, comprising a series of short stories, and was first published in 1930, three years before his death in Hampsted of a stroke.

He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1932, and was praised as an author and dramatist 'of considerable technical skill', whose works helped drive social change.

The Forsyte Saga was made into a hugly popular BBC TV series in the mid sixties, and was brought to life again in 2003 in a series starring Damien Lewis.

Galsworthy wrote the Forsyte Saga, a series of five novels and collection of short stories, between 1906 and 1930. It was made into a TV series in 1967, and again in 2003, starring Damien Lewis (pictured)

Explaining his plans for Galsworthy's house, Mr Berendsen said: 'We believe we've approached our planning proposals sympathetically to protect the history of our house and the surrounding area.

'We circulated a detailed leaflet to our neighbours in advance of submitting our application, setting out our planning proposal including a summary of the engineers’ reports addressing, we hope, some of the concerns that we had expected neighbours may understandably have. 

'We wish to create a family home for our five children which retains its historical significance in an area of London which we love.'
