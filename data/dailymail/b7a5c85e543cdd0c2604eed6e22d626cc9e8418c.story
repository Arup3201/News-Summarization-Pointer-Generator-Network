A five-year-old boy who was found severely malnourished and covered in bruises has been showered with toys and gifts as he recovers in hospital.

The little boy, identified as Jordan Bleimeyer, has gained four pounds since being taken to Houston Hospital after he was discovered weighing just 29 pounds last month.

The child's father Bradley Bleimeyer, 24, and stepmother Tammie Bleimeyer, 33, have been charged with felony child endangerment after allegedly keeping the little boy locked under the stairs.

A picture posted on Monday to the Facebook page 'Toys for Jordan' showed a smiling boy in bed surrounded by toys.

The page administrator wrote: 'The power of love and prayers bring us this amazing smile.

'Please help by sharing this incredible update around the world.'

The boy was moved from the pediatric intensive care unit on Friday, the New York Daily News has reported.

According to the Facebook page documenting his recovery, his dietary restrictions were lifted on Saturday.

Last week, Tammie Bleimeyer claimed to be unaware of his horrific condition because she had not seen him with his shirt off recently.

She claimed she never mistreated the child and that she and her husband separated last summer.

Her ex no longer lives at her home in Spring, Texas, Tammie Bleimeyer said, but took his five-year-old son to live in Alabama. Mrs Bleimeyer filed for divorce last Tuesday from her husband of two years.

Tammie Bleimeyer told KHOU last week: 'I was shocked. I have never seen him look like that and I have never seen him with his shirt off recently.'

However she did not necessarily believe that her estranged husband caused the child's condition.

The 33-year-old added: 'I don’t know what caused him to look like that. I don’t know if it’s a health issue or something else like that. I don’t want to be like everyone else and assume the worse.'

Police discovered a locked closet with a mattress after being called to a home following a disturbance on Thursday, March 27, between Bradley Bleimeyer and his 16-year-old stepson.

The teenager raised the alarm and told police he had found his five-year-old stepbrother in a diaper under the stairs.

The stepmother denied that the boy was kept under the stairs but had a room and slept in a bunk bed.

However she admitted that the child could have fitted under the stairs.

She also said that her 16-year-old son was lying because he did not respect his stepfather Bradley, who is only eight years older than him.

The child's stepmother Tammie Bleimeyer had reportedly fled the home with the boy before officers arrived, according to click2houston.

Bleimeyer, who is six months' pregnant, refused to return to the home when contacted by police.

She was tracked to a motel in Humble by her cellphone where she was found with the boy.

The pregnant 33-year-old told KHOU that she did not flee with the child but had simply gone to get pizza and that her husband was staying at the motel.

His frail body was photographed covered in bumps and bruises with a deep cut on his right shoulder.

Tammie Bleimeyer was charged with endangering a child and released on $2,000 bond.

Bradley Bleimeyer, who was already out on bond for a burglary charge, was also charged with endangering a child.

The 24-year-old, who has spent time in jail and has string of prior convictions, is being held without bond.
