A Virginia woman who barked online about her pup's experience at a dog obedience class  is now feeling the bite of a $65,000 defamation lawsuit.

Jennifer Ujimori is being sued by Dog Tranquility in Burke, Virginia, after she took her puppy to obedience class and then wrote negative reviews about it on Yelp and Angie's List.

Dog Tranquility's owner, Colleen Dermott, filed the suit because she claims Ujimori's reviews were false and they did her business harm.

Ujimori brought her dog Yuki, a Bolognese, to classes at Dog Tranquility because she wanted the then 14-week-old pooch to get more social so it could become a therapy dog, the Washington Post reported. 

According to Ujimori, her dog was not socialized correctly at the $175 basic obedience class and when she asked for a pro-rated refund, it never came.

Ujimori wrote on Yelp: 'In a nutshell, the services delivered were not as advertised and the owner refused a refund.' 

She decided to make her plight public because she wants Virginia to pass legislation against 'strategic lawsuits against public participation', essentially suits that block free speech. 

Yelp has removed the review.

In her lawsuit, Dermott claims she attempted to satisfy her customer and that the contract Ujimori signed had a no-refund clause.

Dermott, 31, has two young children and is married to a solider. 

Some of the dogs she trains are used to help veterans with PTSD. 

Since news of the lawsuit leaked, Dog Tranquility's page on Yelp has been filling up with negative reviews

She said the negative reviews had a 'significant impact' on her small business.

In a post about the lawsuit on Facebook, she wrote: 'I have attempted on numerous occasions to come to a resolution and avoid a legal suit. 

'I understand that I cannot make everyone happy and I do not claim to do that, but her actions clearly show she is trying to drag my business and me through the mud. 

'False accusations are not covered under free speech.

'I am open to critical (and even negative!) reviews of my services, but refuse to allow lies.'

Since news of the lawsuit leaked, Dog Tranquility's page on Yelp has been filling up with negative reviews. 

One person wrote: 'I've heard terrible things about this place, like they sue anyone who writes a bad review about them.'

The page only has reviews which are one star or five stars and nothing in between.  

Jonathan Phillips, Ujimori's attorney, said: 'I do not believe a customer imagines that typing out a review of their experience followed by a few clicks can result in getting slapped with a $65,000 lawsuit.'
