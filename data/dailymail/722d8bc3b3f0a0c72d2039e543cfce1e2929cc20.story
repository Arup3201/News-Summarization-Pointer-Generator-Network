The manager of a cafe has claimed a face that looks like Jesus appeared on a pancake on Good Friday - the day after she had prayed to God to watch over the restaurant.

Karen Hendrickson said she was amazed when a member of her staff showed her the pancake last week at the Cowgirl Cafe, in Norco, California.

It was only after the breakfast snack had been plated-up that a waitress noticed what looks like the face of a man with a beard and long hair on it.

The manager of a cafe has claimed a face that looks like Jesus appeared on a pancake on Good Friday. Karen Hendrickson said she was 'excited and emotional' after spotting the face on the pancake as she had prayed to God the night before to watch over the cafe

Manager Ms Hendrickson said she was 'excited and emotional' after spotting the face on the pancake as she had prayed to God the night before to watch over the cafe.

Ms Hendrickson said: 'On Friday, April 18, at approximately 9.30am, one of my employees came to me (I was in my office working) and told me that a pancake that was just cooked for an order had the face of Jesus on it and she brought her phone with her to show me the picture she had taken of the Jesus pancake.

'My first words to her before seeing the picture was, "You've got to be kidding me", because I thought she was joking.

'But when she showed me the picture, I was totally amazed.

'I then went with Amanda (the employee who took the picture and showed it to me) back to the food window to see the Jesus pancake and there it was.

'I just could not believe what I was seeing in the picture and for it to be happening on Good Friday as well.'

Ms Hendrickson went on to say: 'I was very excited (and emotional) about the Jesus pancake, not only because it occurred on Good Friday, but because the night before I had said a prayer to God asking that he continue to watch over the Cowgirl Cafe (which I have done many times over the last seven years).

'I am not a deeply religious person either. I do believe in God and Jesus and do pray.'
