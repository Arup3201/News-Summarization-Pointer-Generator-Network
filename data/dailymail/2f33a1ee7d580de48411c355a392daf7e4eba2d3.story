Germaine Greer delivered an awkward moment on Q&A program on Monday night when she asked Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop if she would 'free the nipple' to save the lives of Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman.

The social media campaign, which gets its name from the 'free the nipple' hashtag it is associated with, aims to address the taboo surrounding women's nipples being exposed in film, television and photographs.

It was raised by an audience member who was interested in learning the panel's view of how they felt about young women posing topless online.

Feminist icon Germaine Greer asked Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop if she would consider posing topless to spare the Bali Nine duo

While Ms Bishop said it was not something she had ever had the desire to do and emojis were as 'radical' as she would get, the controversial feminist icon asked: 'What if it got you the commutation of two life sentences of two Australians?'

In reply to this, Ms Bishop paused and shook her head in silence as the audience and panelists on the ABC program laughed.

'Please don't got there, Germaine,' the minister finally answered. 

This is Greer's second gaffe on the program. In 2012, the feminist icon said former prime minister Julia Gillard had a 'big arse'. 

Ms Bishop went on to say she was concerned about the concept of young women posting topless photos of themselves on the internet.

'I just worry that the liberation of young women showing their nipple to the world leads to some perverted behaviour coming even more to the fore,' she said. 

Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman were arrested in 2005 for attempting to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin from Indonesia into Australia.

Q&A viewers were as stunned as Julie Bishop when Ms Greer asked the question and took to Twitter to express their surprise.

Some viewers joked that Ms Bishop should join the 'free the nipple' movement on the spot.

The pair were sentenced to death and have spent the last 10 years in Bali's Kerobokan prison.

Chan and Sukuraman are days away from being executed after they were moved to Indonesia's 'Death Island', Nusakambangan, on Wednesday.

Ms Bishop has repeatedly asked the Indonesia government to spare the duo's lives.

It was revealed last week that Ms Bishop tried to organise a prisoners swap in exchange for clemency.

Ms Bishop, along with Greer, was appearing on Q&A's first all-female panel to mark Sunday's International Women's Day.

Other guests were writer Roxane Gay, Best & Less chief executive Holly Kramer and Youth Without Borders founder Yassmin Abdel-Magied.

The show's regular host Tony Jones was replaced by the ABC's chief online political writer Annabel Crabb.

Ms Bishop also discussed the role of being foreign affairs minister and the challenges she would have faced if she had children while in the position.

The minister said she spent a number of days over in the Ukraine following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, which would have been difficult to maneuver if she had been children.

'I'm not suggesting for a moment that every person who's foreign minister should have no children,' she said.

'But the way I'm doing it, the way I fulfill the role as foreign minister, I do spend a lot of time away and I do focus 110 per cent on it.'
