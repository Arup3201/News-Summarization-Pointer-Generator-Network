Vanished: Nida Ul-Naseer, 18, left her medication fro anaemia at home in Newport, South Wales, last week

The family of a missing teenage girl who is believed to have walked out following a row about university have made an emotional public appeal for information on TV.

Nida Ul-Naseer, 18, went missing from her home in Newport, south Wales, on December 28 when she went to take the rubbish out.

When she left, Nida did not have shoes, her mobile phone or a jacket and she needs medication to stop her becoming anaemic.

A major police search operation to find her, which has gone on during the extreme weather, is continuing today.

Her father Naseer Tahir, sister Naila Anwar and a brother appeared together in an interview on ITV's Daybreak programme this morning.

The programme said they felt that earlier reports of a family argument involving Nida had been taken out of context.

It also showed a printed sign pinned to the front door of their home in Newport which reads: 'Nida please come home. Don't worry. We are all missing you.'

Her father said: 'We have some issues, but only in the family. The family are good. We want to see Nida here.'

Naila Anwar described her sister as someone who is 'very close to us. She would always share everything with us. It is just out of character'.

She said of her sister: 'She can't live without a phone. She just always talks to me on the phone.'

She agreed there was no indication that her sister had in any way prepared to leave before vanishing. She had packed nothing.

Pakistan-born Nida had been forced to sacrifice a place at the University of South Wales due to money problems

'Everything is at home, her purse that she used, everything is at home, she's not even taken her coat. Nothing.'

Nida is described as a quiet and very shy girl who is addicted to her mobile phone and afraid of the dark.

It is not known what condition she suffers, as it is understood that the family have declined to elaborate.

Her sister added: 'If you know anything about Nida, just tell us, just call the police. We just want to know that she's safe.'

Friends
 said the 18-year-old was 'disturbed and depressed' when she ran away 
after a row with her parents over her wish to go to university. 

A major police search across marshlands is now under way as Nida remains missing for more than a week

Police have been scouring scrubland by a nearby river after the area was flooded in the storms.

Nida’s parents have put a sign on the door of their home in Newport, South Wales, pleading with her to come home. 

The family, who were all born in Pakistan, are Ahmadiyya Muslims, an offshoot of Islam.

Women
 are usually allowed to go to university but are not allowed to marry 
outside the community. Parents arrange marriages and men can take 
multiple wives.

Nida’s father, homeopath Naseer Tahir, 54, and mother Najma, 47, have refused to speak publicly about their daughter.

However,
 their eldest daughter Shamyla Naseer, 23, said: ‘They are really 
depressed. It is a big loss for us. We are still looking.’

Nida,
 a diligent student who finished school last summer, was looking forward
 to starting a business and finance degree at the University of South 
Wales but had to give up her place because of money problems.

The family placed a sign on the door and issued public appeals to encourage Nida to come home

Gwent Police said: 'We believe she had a verbal disagreement within the home'

Friends of the family said she fled after a furious argument with her parents on Saturday, December 28.

‘Her mother came to our house after to tell us,’ one said.

‘They
 said she was in anger [sic] and she just left the house with nothing. 
No shoes on and no money. No medication, no jacket. She was supposed to 
go to university but she couldn’t. They just said she couldn’t go.’

Another
 close friend said: ‘She was disturbed about university admission and 
finance problems. She couldn’t go so had to start a different course at a
 college.’

The friend’s husband added: ‘She couldn’t go to uni and she was depressed and had arguments.’

Gwent Police assistant chief constable Paul Symes said: ‘We believe she had a verbal disagreement within the home which could have upset her and led to her leaving.’

Nida is 5ft 3in and slim with long dark hair.

She is described as being of Asian-Pakistani appearance and was last seen in blue jeans and a black top.
