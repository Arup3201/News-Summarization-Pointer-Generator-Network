A small fragment of ancient pottery researchers believe shows the first wine label could prove that the reigns of King Solomon and King David actually occurred.

The 10th century BC 'Ophel Inscription' was unearthed last year, and scientists were initially baffled by the bizarre language that was inscribed on the remains of a jug.

A new translation reveals the contents of a jar was 'lousy' plonk intended for slaves - and sheds new light on society at the time.

The label dates from second half of the 10th Century BC and was discovered in the Ophel area of Jerusalem, south of Temple Mount

The word on the pitcher reads 'yayin' or wine and he believes it should read 'in the year [¿ ]M, wine, part, m[¿]' in a form of ancient Hebrew, according to professor Galil

A rare trove of coins and jewellery was found buried near temple Mount in Jerusalem in September 2013.

It included 36 gold coins dating back to the seventh century with images of Byzantine emperors and a 10cm medallion etched with a  Menorah, Shofar made from a Ram's horn and a Torah scroll.

A 3,000-year-old earthenware jug was found - which is the same one that has now been deciphered.

The discovery was made in the ruins of a Byzantine public structure located in the Ophel region - between the city of David and around 50 metres from the southern wall of the First Temple.

Temple Mount is considered one of the most religious sites in Jerusalem and is where two biblical Jewish temples once stood.

It is also a site of Muslim interest site known as the Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary.

This area is thought to be part of an ancient city wall in Jerusalem dating back to the 10th century BC, possibly built by King Solomon.

The label is thought to be the most ancient Hebrew engraving to emerge from the archaeological digs in Jerusalem to date.

'We are dealing here with real kings, and the kingdom of David and Solomon was a real fact,' Gershon Galil from the department of Jewish History at Haifa University told FoxNews.com.

Some experts previously claimed it was written in an ancient near Eastern language, but Galil believes it is actually a form of ancient Hebrew.

The inscription is eight letters long and was engraved on a large clay pitcher in the second half of the 10th century BC in Biblical times, which was used to store cheap wine.

It was found in the Ophel area of the city, south of Temple Mount, as part of a dig by the Archaeological Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

A word on the pitcher reads ‘yayin’ or wine and he believes the whole inscription should read ‘in the year [… ]M, wine, part, m[…]’.

Professor Galil explained the first missing word ends with ‘mem,’ which is the final part of the word for the 20th or 30th year of the kingdom and effectively dates the wine.

The middle portion or ‘wine, part’ 
indicates the type of wine contained in the jar and in the Ugarit 
language from northern Syria, a similar word to 'yayin' means the lowest quality of wine.

The
 final letter has been cut off from a longer word, but Professor 
Gahil thinks it could indicate where the wine came from.

The discovery was made in the ruins of a Byzantine public structure located  in the Ophel region between the city of David and the southern wall of the First Temple, (pictured).

Professor Galil recently  told The Archaeology News Network: ‘This wine wasn’t served to Solomon’s emissaries, or in the temple, but apparently was for the slave construction workers who worked in the area.’

Archaeologists already know that poor quality wine was drunk by soldiers and slave builders and believe that it was stored in large vessels that did not keep it particularly fresh, like the one found in the dig six months ago.

Professor Galil thinks the carving was produced after King Solomon had built the first temple, his palaces and city walls.

The earthenware jar that is now known to contain cheap wine, was found in the Ophel archaeological area in Jerusalem, where other treasures, including a number of Byzantine coins have been discovered

The find sheds light on the Biblical kingdom’s sophisticated society, where many people were thought to be literate, taxes were collected and builders recruited and bought to Jerusalem to build palaces and other infrastructure, according to the study, which was published in the journal New Studies on Jerusalem.

Some historians dispute information gleaned from the Bible that Jerusalem was an important city, but supporters of the Biblical accounts, including Professor Galil, believe the inscription supports stories that tell of complicated administrative systems and a strictly hierarchical society.

‘Scribes that could write administrative texts could also write literary and historiographic texts and this has very important implications for the study of the Bible and understanding the history of Israel in the biblical period,’ he added.

Dr Jonathan Stokl, a lecturer in Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament, from King’s College London told MailOnline: ‘The inscription is written in what is variously called “proto-Canaanite” or “late Canaanite” script.

A 10cm medallion etched with a Menorah, Shofar made from a ram's horn and a Torah scroll, (pictured) was found at the same site as the earthenware jug inscribed with the wine label. However, the medallion dates from the 7th Century, unlike the older wine container

The language is probably an early form of Hebrew, but it could be a closely related dialect spoken in Jerusalem in the 10th century.’

He explained that at the time the inscription was made, the way words were written had not been agreed upon so some people wrote from left to right (like English) while others wrote in the opposite direction, like with modern Hebrew and Arabic.

While Professor Galil has interpreted the inscription from right to left, another academic, Professor Christopher Rollinston has read it in the opposite way, but has not arrived upon a clear meaning.

‘Irrespective of what the reading of the inscription is, it attests to someone writing Hebrew (or a closely related language) in the 10th century in Jerusalem, probably for administrative reasons,’ he said.

‘Professor Galil suggests that this indicates that the inscription was made by some royal administration (something like an early civil service) and I believe that he is probably correct with that.'

The inscription was found in Ophel, near near Temple Mount in Jerusalem (pictured) in December last year

The inscription was found among a pile of pottery (pictured). Leading expert Douglas Petrovich believes the language is a primitive form of Hebrew which suggests the ancient Israelites were recording history much earlier than previously thought

Could mean Bible stories of King David and King Solomon were not passed down orally but written down at the time and are accurate
