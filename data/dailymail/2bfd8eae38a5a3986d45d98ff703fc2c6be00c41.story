Robert Lynch from Zwolle, Louisiana died after he got stuck in an automatic car window as it rolled up

A 19-month-old baby boy died after he crawled from the back seat of the car and got his head trapped in the window as it closed.

Robert Lynch from Zwolle, Louisiana, was sitting in the vehicle without a seatbelt on as his mother said they were 'only driving a short distance'.

But when Denuka Lynch, 26, parked the vehicle and took the keys out of the ignition, the window started to roll up, lodging his neck between the window of the SUV and the door frame

According to KLSA News 12, the first police on the scene performed CPR after finding the boy unconscious on the floor with his mother beside him. 

He was still not breathing and had no pulse by the time paramedics arrived.

The toddler was transferred to Sabine Medical Center then flown to University Health in Shreveport, where he was placed in the pediatric intensive care unit.

However the boy was pronounced brain dead and the decision was taken to remove him from life support the next day.

Investigators would later learn that the boy’s mother, Miss Lynch, had just left a family gathering and had placed her son in the backseat of her car without restraining him.

She told investigators that after she parked her car she noticed that the back window was rolling up, trapping her son. 

No arrest has been made in the case that's still under investigation by the Zwolle Police Department and Sabine Parish Coroner's office. 

Lynch’s family say this was a tragic accident and is in no way reflective of her parenting skills. 

Danny Lynch, the victim's grandfather, told KLSA: 'This is just something that happened and as a family we are going to stand together,

The boy’s father, Mike Garner, told the station the boy's mother her child in harm’s way. 'I know she wouldn’t do anything to Robert,' he said. 'We all loved him'.

Police have not yet filed any charges in relation to the death of the youngster. However they have said the investigation is still ongoing and have taken a drug test from Miss Lynch

A coroner from Sabine Parish Coroner's office confirmed he died from positional asphyxia. 

The boy was in the back seat of this car when he climbed up and got his head stuck in the window as it rolled up when her mother Denuka, 26, parked up

Denuka Lynch said she had just left a family gathering and was only driving a short distance home. Police have not charged her or anyone else in relation to the death
