Gary Cahill has boldly claimed England can win all 10 of the Euro 2016 qualifiers.

Roy Hodgson's team have a 100 per cent record from three games in Group E, having already beaten Switzerland away, and the Chelsea defender says England are targeting finishing the campaign in the same fashion.

Cahill missed training on Tuesday but will be back on Wednesday and fit for the match against Slovenia at Wembley on Saturday.

Lithuania, San Marino, and Estonia complete the group and Cahill thinks England should win every match.

'It’s likely because we have good players and we’ve worked extremely hard since the disappointments of this summer,' he said.

'We’ve turned our performances round and changed the shape slightly which has worked well for us. We’ve had five clean sheets on the spin so it’s positive. But we need to keep pushing ourselves and keep this run and the good feeling going.

'Five clean sheets is something we’re really proud of. It’s something we’re pleased with and as a group we felt we needed to tighten up after the summer.

'But leading up to the World Cup we were doing well but the crunch games happened over the summer and we came in for a little bit of criticism, so it was important we tightened that up.

'I think everyone’s bought into how we want to play. We’ve changed the shape slightly and that’s worked really well for us.'

Cahill also backed Wayne Rooney, who is set to win his 100th cap, to surpass Peter Shilton's record of 125 appearances.

'He can go on for many, many more years. I don't want to jinx him but he can break all the records.

'He's fit, he looks after himself, he trains really hard. I can't see why not.

'He's a fantastic player. When you look at how old he is to be coming up to 100 caps it is phenomenal.'
