As the warmer months approach, experts warn that Australians are risking giving themselves food poisoning by ignoring expiry dates and storage or cooking instructions on food labels.

Alarming statistics show that only just over half of 1200 Australians surveyed always comply with used by dates and less than half of the consumers abide by best before warnings.

Dr Michael Eyles, council chair of Food Safety Information Council which was commissioned to do the Newspoll survey, described the results as disturbing.

Ignoring cooking instructions creates a particularly high risk of food poisoning from goods with egg products (left) poultry and minced (left) or cubed meats

‘Frightening is not too strong a word to describe other results, including that only a third (33 per cent) of people always read and comply with storage instructions and a meagre 14 per cent always read and comply with cooking instructions,' Dr Eyles elaborated.

While an astounding 86 per cent of people surveyed don’t always read and comply with cooking instructions which is: ‘far too high and creates a serious food poisoning risk, especially for poultry, minced or cubed meats, or egg products,’ Dr Eyles said.

Dr Eyles said following storage instructions was essential with perishable food

‘Refrigerate after opening’, ‘keep frozen’ or ‘refrigerate under 4°C’ must be followed or food poisoning bacteria will grow quickly,’ he warned.

86 per cent of people surveyed don’t always follow cooking instructions while only three in 10 use insulated bags to carry their refrigerated goods home from the shops

Storage of food in the correct temperature was also an issue with only three in 10 people using insulated bags to carry their refrigerated goods home from the shops.

Dr Eyles hoped other shoppers would follow the lead of the smart consumers who had the foresight to take coolers when shopping their cold items.

‘Refrigerated food can warm quickly into the temperature danger zone (5° to 60°C) where food poisoning bacteria can grow,’ he said.

‘This is especially risky for foods that won’t be cooked again such as sliced deli meats, pate, prepared salads, cut fruits and soft cheeses.’

The good news is that more than eight in 10 (83 per cent) of surveyors said the last time they bought refrigerated items it took less than 30 minutes to get the food from the store to their fridge with nearly everyone else getting the food home in under an hour.
