It was built as a countryside haven by a wealthy heir who fulfilled his dream of becoming a farmer - and for nine years it was the perfect family home.

But half a century later, this once-opulent six-bedroom mansion looks anything but lavish.

With its smashed windows, decaying plaster and graffiti-sprayed walls, Overstone House has become an eerie and empty shell visited only by ghost-hunters.

Lifetime ago: The empty mansion in Leicestershire was once the countryside haven of a wealthy man who had inherited a fortune

The enormous property, constructed with a tennis court, swimming pool and spiral staircase, was built in 1966 by Patrick Loyd after he had inherited a large sum of money from his grandfather.

The young man, who was a student at the Royal Agricultural University in Cirencester, spent around eight years working the surrounding land as an arable and beef farmer. 

He moved into the property aged just 24 and stayed there with his wife and three children until 1974 - when he left the UK for Guernsey for tax reasons. 

Hidden away from any main road in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, the house overlooks the River Jordan away from the public gaze.

Decayed: Wealthy heir Patrick Loyd paid £150,000 for the property to be built in 1966 but was forced to leave in 1974 for tax reasons

Mr Loyd paid £150,000 for it to be built - more than 30 times the price of an average property at the time, which was around £4,000.

The former farmer, 72, was not reachable today, but his son Richard, 46, recalled fond early memories growing up in the house, having lived there until the age of six.

Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'It was a very nice, dreamy sort of home to grow up in and I'm sure I would have made more use of it had we stayed there longer. 

'The few memories I have of it are extremely fond. My father bought the house while he was an agricultural student and said he had inherited the money to pay for it as a beneficiary of Baron Overstone, his grandfather.

'I never knew what inspired him to build the place or exactly why we had to leave. My parents were fairly private people and we've never really discussed these things.

'It was the sort of upbringing where children were meant to be seen and not heard. When we left England, my dad was about 32.' 

After the Loyds left, the property was lived in by a Mrs Leslie before briefly being used as offices for commercial businesses.

The site has since been purchased by Careys Homes who plan to turn Overstone House into 50 new homes.

The mansion lies on an ancient site where excavations have uncovered a Neolithic tool resembling a knife.

Many more discoveries have been made on the site showing evidence of Bronze Age and Roman activity - with pottery, coins, metal objects and glass were all being recovered in archaeological excavations.
