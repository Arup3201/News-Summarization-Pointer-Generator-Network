Marouane Fellaini has blamed injury for a below-par first season at Manchester United, but promised that the club will see the best of him next season.

Fellaini was a deadline day signing from Everton for £27.5million but failed to live up to his hefty price tag as the Premier League champions failed to defend their crown and qualify for the Champions League.

The midfielder injured his wrist in a Champions League match against Shakhtar Donetsk on only his third appearance for United, an injury which eventually required surgery in December and kept him out of action until February.

Improvement: But the Belgian midfielder says he will be fully fit and back to top form next season

But the Belgium international, who will play for his country at the 2014 World Cup this summer, is convinced that he will return to Old Trafford fully fit next season and prove that he is worthy of a place in the United team.

Fellaini told the Daily Telegraph: 'I need to be fit to be good. Even when I am injured I can play but the fitness is not the same. I was injured for three months and that was a difficult moment for me.

'When you arrive in a new team you want to play, you want to stay with the team and when you can’t play it is difficult to see the team – even off the pitch.

'When this season finishes I will start with my preparation for the next year and it will be good.'

Fellaini was signed for United by David Moyes, who he also spent five seasons under at Everton, and has backed his former boss to return to football quickly.

He has also urged United fans to give United time to rebuild after this season's failure, but is confident that whoever is appointed to replace Moyes will be capable of turning the club back into challengers for top honours.

Fellaini added: 'I learnt a lot from him and for that I am very grateful. It was a shame things didn’t work out for him at Manchester United but David is still a great manager and I’m sure he will be back in football very soon. Whoever becomes the next manager, they will bring fresh philosophies to help the players achieve what the fans want.

'The supporters and the people have to give us time. I know we can win in one game against any team. But when you play for Man United you need to win every game. I have never won a trophy in England. I will work hard, the club will work hard, and the new staff will work hard to win trophies. As players we must take responsibility for our performances and it is up to us to help the new manager turn United back into a team capable of winning the title.'
