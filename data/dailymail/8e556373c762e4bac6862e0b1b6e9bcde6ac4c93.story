For many people, being happy at work is an important pursuit and something which drives employees in- and out- of certain workplaces.

Australian entrepreneur, motivational speakers, and founder of RedBalloon Naomi Simson learnt this the hard way, after the company recorded a 60% turnover rate in a single year.

'People were unhappy. They were lost and confused. When we recorded a 60% turnover rate that was the moment I realised that I could have all the vision in the world, but if I wasn't bringing people along with me, it meant nothing,' Naomi told Daily Mail Australia.

Naomi started RedBalloon in 2001, running the company from her home and gradually building it up into the iconic business it is today, providing customers with 'experience gifts' that range from workshops to skydiving.

'At the time we expanded, I needed really amazing people around me. But if there's no job description then people aren't going to be sure of what they are doing,' she said.

'Leadership is about taking responsibility. My personal motto is that if it is up to me, I'm accountable.'  

'So I realised that I needed to make some fundamental changes so that people who came to work with us knew they were doing something of value.'

The impact the changes made became evident in the growth of the company, which has sold more than two and a half million experiences and was voted one of BRW's Best Places to Work  for five consecutive years.

Naomi has also consistently been recognised by the business community for her approach, winning awards including the 2005 Westpac NSW Entrepreneur of the Year and the National Telstra Business Women's Award for Innovation in 2008.

'When you are effectively competing with other businesses you need to identify why people would want to work for you,' Naomi said.

'People want to work for a business that has a clear sense of purpose. People want to have fun and believe in the work they are doing,' she said.

Naomi, who now also runs an award-winning blog, and has close to 800,000 followers as a LinkedIn Influencer, said that the key to her business model is recognition and trust.

'It was about introducing a philosophy of recognition, both peer to peer and within teams, so that employees can thank people in other parts of the business,' she said.

The approach was so successful when it was adopted at RedBalloon that the company decided to launch a platform for other businesses to do the same.

'We wanted to share what we learnt because we want other people to have great workplaces too,' Naomi said.

The technology, called Redii, is designed to enable employees and employers to communicate their appreciation to one another.

'I want people to be proud of where they work and want to tell everyone.'

Naomi, who has also added public speaker to her CV, has written Live What You Love, a book designed to help readers identify their passion and pursue it.

'When you're with your family don't sit on a tablet or device,' Naomi said (above with her children)

As part of this, the entrepreneur has identified four key factors that employees desire for a 'good day' at work, based on a survey of more than 3000 Australians and New Zealanders.

More praise, better managers, more time with friends and family, and greater trust are all crucial to running a business in which workers are happy and feel as though they are valued.

'In terms of praise, it's not about an entitlement culture. It's about encouraging people to do more praising because when you give you feel great,' Naomi said,

'Managers are there to nurture the uniqueness of individuals, which is different to leadership. It's about amplifying the greatness of people in their roles,' she said.

She is also passionate about trusting people to do their jobs, and enabling them to do their roles well.

'If you are going to employ adults then they are clearly not children. People should be trusted at work and encouraged to do their best work,' Naomi said,

'Don't do other people's jobs for them. If I even consider doing someone else's task then I have just immediately diminished my colleague and have shown them I don't trust them,' she said.

Naomi said that identifying how to live with passion and purpose, which she believes are key to living a successful and happy life, make all the difference at work and at home.

'Ultimately when you work with purpose it does not feel like work.'
