News makers: Vanity Fair magazine released it's 'New Establishment' rankings for 2013, with music mogul Jay Z and his wife Beyonce taking the first position

A new ranking of American movers and shakers confirms what we all already knew: our first couple isn't the Obamas - it's the Carters.

According to Vanity Fair's 'New Establishment' for 2013, musician couple Jay Z and Beyonce are the most important powers that be in the U.S.

Mr and Mrs Shaun Carter were last ranked number eight, but their busy year propelled them to the number one spot.

Helping them nab the top honor was Jay Z's new album, Magna Carter Holy Grail, which went platinum before it even hit store shelves thanks to a strategically planned pre-order release.

Beyonce did her part too by booking a Super Bowl halftime performance, selling out her world tour and releasing a documentary about her life on HBO.

Also in the top five were outgoing New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as the heads of Comcast, Disney and 21st Century Fox.

New additions to the list include J. Crew's creative director Jenna Lyons and new Stars Wars franchise director JJ Abrams.

Steve Jobs' widow  Laurene Powell Jobs also made the list this year for her work on immigration reform. Since her husband's passing, it is estimated that Mrs Powell-Jobs is worth $11billion.

And for starting the Beats electronics company, rapper turned producer Dr Dre came in at number six with his partner Jimmy Iovine.

Jon Feltheimer, the head of Lionsgate, was knocked up to number 20 for his work acquiring three teen movie franchises: The Hunger Games, Ender's Game and Divergent. The TV production side of his business has been booming as well with hits like Mad Men, Nashville and Orange is the New Black.
