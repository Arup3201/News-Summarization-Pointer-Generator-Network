One of Michelle Bachmann's former chiefs of staff launched a scathing attack on his old boss today, claiming she was 'decidedly' not ready to be president.

Ron Carey, who worked for Mrs Bachmann last year, described her offices as 'wildly out of control' and criticised her for a lack of leadership experience.

It came as the 55-year-old attempted to mend her increasingly gaffe-prone reputation in a television interview this morning - only to make another historical mistake by claiming John Quincy Adams was a Founding Father.

In fact, he was just nine-years-old at the time of the Declaration of Independence.

And yesterday, the Republican made another embarrassing gaffe,when she inadvertently compared herself to serial killer John Wayne instead of the actor.

In an article for the Des Moines 
Register, Mr Carey, who worked for Mrs Bachmann for several months last 
year, says his former boss doesn't have the leadership experience needed
to be president.

Attack: Ron Carey said his former boss Michele Bachmann was 'decidedly' not ready to be president

He conceded she had 'great oratory skills', but added: 'She is not prepared to assume the White House in 2013.'

Mr Carey, who served as chairman of the Minnesota Republican Party from 2005 to 2009, says he knows Mrs Bachmann 'very well'.

But he believes she offers no challenge to fellow candidate Tim Pawlenty, for whom Mr Carey also worked.

He was particularly scathing about Mrs 
Bachmann's managerial skills. He wrote: 'The Bachmann campaign and 
congressional offices I inherited were wildly out of control.

'Stacks upon stacks of 
unopened contributions filled the campaign office while thousands of 
communications from citizens waited for an answer

'If she is unable, or unwilling, to handle the basic duties of a campaign or congressional office, how could she possibly manage the magnitude of the presidency?'

Today she was out on the campaign trail again at a meeting in Raymond, New Hampshire.

She formally launched her presidential bid yesterday, from her hometown of Waterloo, in Iowa.

Strong support: Mrs Bachmann's address, at a mansion in Waterloo, won her rapturous applause - but today she was criticised by a former aide

The Minnesota congresswoman has won support from many in the Tea Party for her hardline opinions on abortion and gay marriage, but she has also attracted criticism for her inaccuracies.

According to Politifact.com,a political fact-checking service, Mrs Bachmann's record for inaccuracy is worse than all the other Republican candidates.

Yesterday she told Fox News: 'Well what I
want them to know is just like, John Wayne was from Waterloo, Iowa. 
That's the kind of spirit that I have too,’ she told Fox News.

Unfortunately for Mrs Bachmann, that John Wayne is in fact John Wayne Gacy, also known as the 'Killer Clown', who was executed in 1894 for raping and murdering more than 30 boys and young men.

He was born in Chicago, but later moved to Waterloo where he began his crime spree.

Although the actor of the same name is originally from Iowa, he was in fact born in Winterset - more than 150 miles away.

Politifact.com, a political fact-checking service, examined 24 of Michele Bachmann's recent statements for their accuracy.

It found just one to be fully true and 17 to be false - more than any other Republican candidate whose statements have been vigorously vetted.

They include:

The claim: 'The farm is my father-in-law's farm. It's not my husband and my farm. It's my father-in-law's farm. And my husband and I have never gotten a penny of money from the farm.' (Fox News Sunday)

The facts: In personal financial disclosure reports produced by members of Congress each year, Mrs Bachmann said she holds an interest in a family farm in Independence, Wisconsin, with her share worth between $100,000 and $250,000.

The farm, which was owned by her father-in-law, produced income for Mrs Bachmann of at least $32,500 and as much as $105,000 from 2006 to 2009, according to the reports she filed for that period.

The farm also received federal crop and disaster subsidies, according to a database maintained by the Environmental Working Group. From 1995 to 2010, the farm was given $259,332 in federal payments.

When asked about the subsidies and her income from the farm late last year, a spokesman for Bachmann said only that she wasn't involved in decisions about the running of the farm.

Yesterday she said her husband became a trustee of the farm because his father had dementia before he died two years ago, and he now 'oversees the legal entity'.

She insisted she and her husband receive no farm income, despite the forms reporting it.

The claim: 'If you look at one of our Founding Fathers, John Quincy Adams, that's absolutely true. He was a very young boy when he was with his father serving essentially as his father's secretary.

'He tirelessly worked throughout his life to make sure that we did in fact one day eradicate slavery.' (Good Morning America)

The facts: John Quincy Adams was not a Founding Father. He was nine-years-old when the Declaration of Independence was made and 20 when the Constitution was adopted

His father, John Adams, was a Revolutionary War figure and an architect of the declaration - and therefore a Founding Father. Both father and son became president.

Mrs Bachmann was defending her earlier, inaccurate remark that the Founding Fathers had devoted themselves to ending slavery.

John Quincy Adams, president from 1825 to 1829, privately called slavery a 'great and foul stain', but largely sidestepped the issue in office, according to The Reader's Companion to the American Presidency.

He tried to avoid antagonising the South, while reasoning that his push for a stronger central government would hasten slavery's end over time.

The claim: 'Well what I want them to know is, just like John Wayne was from Waterloo, Iowa, that's the kind of spirit that I have, too.' (Fox News)

The facts: Wayne the actor was born in Winterset, Iowa, nearly three hours away, and moved to California in his childhood.

John Wayne Gacy, convicted of killing 33 men and boys, was born in Chicago, moved to Waterloo to work in his father-in-law's chicken restaurants and first ran afoul of the law there, sentenced to 10 years for sodomy. He began his killing spree after his release, and his return to Illinois.

Bachmann told CNN on Tuesday her comments 'were just misspeaking' and that her main intent was to show she identified with Wayne's patriotism.

The claim: 'Overnight we are hearing that potentially 10 to 30,000 people could have been killed in the strike.' (She was criticising Mr Obama in May for the 'foolish' U.S. intervention in Libya, and citing what she said were reports of a civilian death toll from a NATO strike as high as 30,000)The facts: The U.S. ambassador to Libya, Gene Cretz, said in late April that U.S. officials have seen reports that 10,000 to 30,000 people may have died in Gaddafi's crackdown on protesters and the fighting between rebels and pro-government forces, but it is hard to know if that is true.

He was speaking about all casualties of the conflict; no one has attributed such a death toll to NATO bombing alone, much less to a single strike.

The claim: 'It's ironic and sad that the president released all of the oil from the strategic oil reserve... There's only a limited amount of oil that we have in the strategic oil reserve. It's there for emergencies.' (CBS's Face the Nation)

The facts: Mr Obama did not empty all the oil from the strategic reserve, as Bachmann said. He approved the release of 30 million barrels, about 4 per cent of the 727 million barrels stored in salt caverns along the Texas and Louisiana coasts.

It's true that the U.S. normally taps the reserve for more dire emergencies than exist today, and that exposes Obama to criticism that he acted for political gain.

But the reserve has never been fuller; it held 707 million barrels when last tapped, after hurricanes in 2008.

The claim: 'That's the number of new drilling permits under the Obama administration since they came into office' (comment  to a conservative conference in Iowa in March) 

The facts: The Obama administration issued more than 200 new drilling permits before the Gulf oil spill alone. Over the past year, since new safety standards were imposed, the administration has issued more than 60 shallow-water drilling permits.

Since the deep water moratorium was lifted in October, nine new wells have been approved.
