When your local pub is refurbished you might expect a few new leather chairs, polished bar and a lick of paint.

So former regulars of the Red Lion in Mayfair might be surprised to see it now has an indoor swimming pool, five bedrooms and eight bathrooms.

The disused pub has been transformed from a dingy drinking establishment to a luxury home – worth £25million.

Luxury: This is the dining room of Red Lion House, a £25million home in Mayfair which has been converted from a pub

Rare: The home boasts a roof terrace overlooking the wealthy district of Mayfair

Conversion: The whole of the building was demolished apart from the old facade of the former pub

Gone: The popular Red Lion pub was shut down in 2009 and the building is now back on the market

Cladding: Much of the building is now covered in aluminium leaves intended to imitate a nearby Virginia Creeper tree

It was closed down in 2009 and sold 
to developers who began a major renovation project in the style of the 
Channel 4 programme Grand Designs.

Much
 of the building was demolished, but the Red Lion’s original facade – 
now painted a pristine white – is still part of the home.Architects 
designed two subterranean levels, more than doubling the site’s area 
from 4,200sqft  to 9,500sqft.

They
 even clad a large expanse  of the property’s walls in 4,080 folded 
aluminium leaves which mirror the real Virginia creeper climbing the 
opposite building on Curzon Street.

And
 while drinkers may have  jostled for a seat on a Friday night in the 
old pub, its new occupants will be spoilt for choice thanks  to four 
reception rooms and two roof terraces.

Pool: Two new storeys built below ground include a subterranean swimming pool, pictured

Marble: Two of the eight bathrooms contained in the home, which is one of the priciest currently on the market in Britain

Entertainment: The home cinema room at Red Lion House, which will cost 250 times the average British home

Relaxation: One of four reception rooms in the home; planning permission was granted by Westminster council despite estate agents' doubts

Room with a view: The lucky new owner will be able to look over Michelin-starred restaurants and luxury hotels

Keeping fit: The in-house gym is another feature of the extra space built below ground

The
 home, now called Red Lion House, still has a bar in the underground 
part of the building – which also boasts a cinema, gym and swimming 
pool.

Marketed by estate 
agent Wetherell, the property is within close reach of 26 
Michelin-starred restaurants and a number of five-star hotels. It also 
includes underfloor heating, a bespoke kitchen and a maid’s bedroom.

Peter
 Wetherell, managing director of the estate agent, said the pub ‘went 
downhill over the years’, adding: ‘It is a prime example of what you can
 do by taking a piece of real estate and transforming it into a fine 
home.

‘It is also a bit of a mystery from the outside, and having a roof terrace is rare – you don’t see many of these in Mayfair.’

The £25million price tag makes Red Lion House 150 times more expensive than the average property sold in England and Wales.

Fixtures and fittings: The kitchen and casual dining area in the home, located in an area beloved of the international super-rich

Pastel hues: One of the five bedrooms in Red Lion House, designed by architects Squire and Partners

Work: A desk and sofa dominate this office space in the home, which could prove a fruitful work environment for the millionaire who buys it

Going for a dip: The steps which lead into the underground pool below the property

Suite: Another bedroom in the unique property being sold by estate agent Peter Wetherell

Garden: One of the roof terraces is covered in greenery with a wall of plants and several pots

Expansive: The home will be perfect for an oligarch looking to settle in to the luxury London lifestyle

Chillaxing: The sofa area of the house next to a coffee table and fireplace

Bath: The radical re-design of the house was praised by planners who said the building was 'striking'

Sought-after: The unique property is likely to attract a fierce bidding war from ultra-wealthy buyers
