China has paved the way for  an end to the diplomatic stand-off with the United States over blind dissident Chen Guangcheng by saying he can apply to study abroad.

In a ‘nudge’ to Beijing to speed up granting Chen freedom to travel, the US state department said he had been offered a fellowship by a US university and that it would provide visas for the activist and his family.

The US added that it ‘expected’ China to allow them to leave soon.

Chen's thrilling story of fleeing from house arrest to the U.S. embassy has emerged.

An account of his daring mission in The New York Times reveals that Chen was bundled into a US embassy car after his car was chased down by Chinese agents.

A 
bruised and bloodied Chen, who had climbed over several walls in 
escaping his guards, hid out at several of his friends' houses before 
deciding to go to the U.S. embassy.

He 
was due to be driven by a friend to rendezvous with U.S. officials, but 
as the two cars were about to meet, the Americans noticed Chinese 
security tailing each car.

The 
car carrying Chen swerved into an alley and he was bundled into the 
embassy car. As it drove off, the two Chinese vehicles gave chase, but 
the U.S. driver managed to shake them off.

Once they made it to the embassy, American diplomats imposed a media blackout, preventing any knowledge of Chen's presence.

China’s face-saving offer partially 
lifted the shadow over Beijing talks between US Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton and Chinese President Hu Jintao.

But some analysts urged caution over a
quick resolution to the issue, saying China’s leaders fear that being 
soft on Chen, 40, could unleash more challenges to their Communist rule.

Human rights lawyer Tang Jitian warned
that the authorities could easily hold up the paperwork to delay Chen 
leaving the country.

‘We can’t be 100 per cent optimistic,’ he said.

Chen, who campaigned against forced 
abortions under China’s  ‘one-child’ policy, humiliated the Beijing 
authorities by escaping house arrest and seeking refuge in the US 
embassy.

He stayed for six days until Wednesday, when the Chinese government gave assurances on the safety of him and his family.

He is now being treated in hospital for a broken foot, an injury he received as he scaled a wall round his house.

He is under guard while his family is monitored round the clock.

At first there appeared to be a deal 
between Chinese and US diplomats to allow him to be reunited with his 
wife and two small children.

Then Chen appealed to be allowed to spend some time in the United States.

Despite the tensions, Mrs Clinton claimed yesterday that ties between the two countries were the strongest they had ever been.

'Of course, the United States continues to raise human rights because we
believe that they are essential for every country to uphold.'

'We raise specific matters of individuals and situations whenever 
necessary because we cannot ignore our areas of difference in the 
comprehensive relationship that we are building,' Clinton said.

The Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement on its website that Chen would be allowed to study overseas 'in accordance with laws of relevant departments' but did not give any further details.

China's top diplomat Dai Bingguo admitted that there were differences but called the talks a 'tremendous' success
with a candid exchange of views. He said human rights were discussed 
but there are differences.

'On the issue of human rights, no country can claim to be perfect. China
will continue to stay on the right course it has chosen,' Dai said.

Chen, who campaigned against abortion under China's 'one-child' policy, spent six days at the U.S. embassy after fleeing house arrest, but entered hospital under Chinese control. 

He remains under guard at the VIP wing of the Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing where he arrived with U.S. 
officials for a medical check up. He is being treated for a broken foot, which he injured scaling a wall during his escape.

A young Chinese woman used the diplomatic storm to protest outside the hospital. She held up a sign that read 'Daqing oil management is corrupt, forced redundancy, no money to eat. I want to eat, I want to live,' protesting against her redundancy from her job at Daqing, China's largest oil field.
