An overjoyed son has met his real mother for the first time in 57 years after she gave him away when he was just a six week old baby.

Kevin Scott, 57, who lives in Chepstow, South Wales, was born out of wedlock in a nursing home for unmarried mothers - and feared he would meet his natural mother. 

But Kevin and his birth mother Pat Johnson were in floods of tears today after they were reunited with a giant hug.

Kevin tracked his mother down to her place of work after his adoptive parents died, but he was told she had retired 10 years earlier. 

But Pat's former work colleagues agreed to pass on Kevin's number - not knowing if she would want to relive her past.

Kevin was at home the next day when the phone rang and a woman rang asked his date of birth.

When he gave it, the voice at the end of the line said: 'This is your mum.'

Pat, 78, packed a suitcase and left her home near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, to travel 200 miles to meet her son for the first time since 1957.

Pat said: 'I never thought I'd see my Kevin again - all I ever had was one photograph to remind me of him and that got destroyed years ago.

'I can still remember Monday October 20 1957 when I carried him down the stairs to the childless couple who were adopting him.

'It broke my heart but as the years went by I resigned myself to the fact I'd never see my little boy again.'

Pat was taken in by the church-run Quarry Nursing Home for Unmarried Mothers in Lincoln when she became pregnant at the age of 20.

She said: 'There was a great deal of shame attached to being an unmarried mother in those days - I gave my baby up because I felt I had no choice.

'I still live near Lincoln but I can't bear to look at the old nursing home - it brings back too many memories.'

Kevin was brought up in Scunthorpe by Doris and Dennis Scott, who moved to South Wales in 1964 when their adopted little boy was just seven.

When Doris died four years ago Kevin, a mechanic, decided it was time he discovered who his real mother was. 

He was inspired by Davina McCall's ITV show which featured a case at the Quarry Maternity Home.

After an approach to social services drew a blank he told his story to his next door neighbour Dikka Cram, 49, who offered to help.

Dikka worked her magic on the internet - and just three days later Kevin took the call from the mother he feared he'd lost for ever.

Kevin said: 'When we met I was tingling all over - it was brilliant and of course there were a lot of tears.

'She just looked at me and said, "Come here", and gave me a big hug. It is all like some sort of surreal dream so much time has passed.

'But I have my mum now and that's all that matters. I just love calling her mum, just saying the word is brilliant.'

Divorced father-of-four Kevin has also discovered he has a half-brother Neil, stepfather George, 80, and lots of other relatives - Pat was the youngest of 11 children.

He said: 'We can't stop talking and we keep finding out more and more about each other.

'I'm very proud of her because she must have gone through a lot of heartache to give me up because I was born out of wedlock.

'But she went on to become a successful businesswoman.

'We will make up for lost time and I'm already planning to visit her at her home to meet my new family.

'I don't know how to thank Dikka - I had wondered about my proper mum all my life and she found her for me in just three days.'

Musician and mother-of-one Dikka said: 'I just did it as a favour for a friend. I'm just thrilled for both of them, it is a real happy ending.'
