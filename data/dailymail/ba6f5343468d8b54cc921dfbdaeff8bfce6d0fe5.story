George Peppard might be best known for playing the tough-as-nails Colonel John 'Hannibal' Smith in The A-Team, but his real-life home is as sweet and charming as his soft-spoken writer who once romanced Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast At Tiffany's. 

The Hollywood legend's two-bedroom Greek-revival home is now for sale at just under $2.7million (£1.8m)

Nestled in a corner off the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, the 2,500sq ft property has three covered porches, one with classic Athenian-style columns.

Peppard became a major film star after landing the role as Audrey Hepburn's love interest in the beloved 1961 hit Breakfast at Tiffany's. 

The film helped him land leading roles throughout the 1960s in films such as The Carpetbaggers, The Victors, and How the West Was Won.
