Whoever said children grow up fast has obviously never met this cute chick who has gone from a tiny yellow ball of fluff to young bird in just 26 days of life.

This is a female Tawny Frogmouth who was born in St Louis Zoo's Bird House on November 2.

She has been cared for by keepers during her first month, who have fed her mice and small insects because her parents lack the experience to raise her.

Born at the St Louis Zoo on November 2, this Tawny Frogmouth chick was a tiny yellow ball of fluff

Her parents came to St. Louis from the Darling 
Downs and Adelaide zoos in Australia as part of the Association of Zoos 
and Aquariums' Species Survival Plan (SSP).

An 
SSP coordinates breeding and conservation of a species between AZA 
accredited zoos - a joint project between U.S and Australian partners to
bring 12 new founder animals to the population in U.S. zoos.

All of the birds were captive born or brought to the Australian zoos as orphaned chicks that could not be released back into the wild. It is hoped that this effort will result in a more sustainable North American population.

After a few days the female bird lost her yellow feathers for tawny fur for which the species is named

Tawny frogmouths mostly live in Australian and Tasmanian forests, open woodlands and near human settlements.Â 

The bird is named for its wide frog-like mouth, which it uses to capture insects, mice and even frogs.

The frogmouth is a master of disguise. It looks remarkably like a broken tree branch as it roosts in a tree during the day, before becoming active at night.

After just 26 days of life the bird, born to a mating pair from Australia, is almost unrecognisable

Matt Schamberger, keeper of birds at the zoo, said: 'Our goal is to always have the parents rear their own birds, but this pair is a pair of first-time parents and often times the learning curve is pretty steep, so we try to help out the parents if we can.'
