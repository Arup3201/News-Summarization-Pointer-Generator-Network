By selling the Big Issue, vendors can register as self-employed and claim benefits, Iain Duncan Smith said (file picture)

Selling the Big Issue is being used by poor eastern Europeans as a fast-track route to claiming benefits in Britain, Iain Duncan Smith has warned.

Becoming a vendor of the magazine for homeless people allows people to register as self-employed, and claim working tax credits.

The Work and Pensions Secretary said the loophole was being used ‘more and more’, with a warning that benefits tourism applied to those in work as well as the jobless.

The government wants to tighten rules on when migrants can claim benefits after arriving in Britain.

At the start of the year new rules were introduced banning claims for the first three months, but senior Tories want to go much further.

Most of the focus has been on migrants claiming Jobseekers Allowance and other out-of-work benefits instead of moving to the UK for in search of a job.

But speaking in Berlin, Mr Duncan Smith said there are growing concerns about the abuse of in-work benefits.

Answering questions after delivering a speech on welfare reform, the Conservative Cabinet minister said there was a perception which has a ‘core element of truth’ that people arriving in the UK ‘find themselves drifting in and out of benefits’.

He added: ‘A good example of that is the Big Issue, a magazine which is a brilliant idea by a brilliant individual who himself was homeless. It is wonderful.

‘But actually what is happening progressively, more and more, is people mostly from southern and eastern Europe have actually ended up being Big Issue sellers and they claim, as self-employed, immediately, tax credits,’ The Times reported.

‘So when we talk about benefits, they are not just out-of-work benefits, they are also in-work benefits that are being claimed.

‘Romanians have been claiming those for some time now, regardless of when they came in. We had a reasonable influx of Romanians long before we opened the doors on January 1.

‘They came in on the self-employment level and that is an issue that needs to be dealt with. So [when] I talk about benefit tourism in a sense, we are talking about in-work benefit tourism.’

The Work and Pensions Secretary said he wanted to tackle the perception of benefit tourism, including among those in work

The remarks followed a controversial speech in which he hit out at the European Commission for telling us ‘we will have to pay benefits to anyone who comes here from Europe, regardless of their circumstances’, and that doing otherwise is ‘akin to xenophobia’.

He said the Government had already banned new migrants from claiming housing benefit and stopped them from getting unemployment or family support until they have been living in the UK for at least three months.

Migrants without work are also now required to prove they can speak English and that they will be able to get a job in order to claim.

But Mr Duncan Smith said Britain wanted to go further, and demanded ‘the right to say to migrants that we require a much longer record of commitment before you get benefits and shortening the duration of any benefit claim that is allowed’.

However, in response to his claims about the Big Issue, the magazine insisted that the ‘problem is the government's and not one of [our] making’.

‘In the meantime, it is wrong to promote the idea that the Big Issue is doing anything nefarious or harmful in adding to a problem which is not of its making,’ a spokesman said.

The Department for Work and Pensions said it was already taking action to deal with the Big Issue loophole, insisting claimants must earn a minimum £153-a-week.
