A man whose hand swelled and turned black and yellow after a spider bit him discovered he had been the victim of the UK's most venomous spider - but only when he posted a picture of it on Facebook five weeks later.

Alex Michael said his had was still 'swollen like a balloon' after what turned out to be a false widow spider - the British cousin of the lethal black widow - bit him while he was asleep at his home in Blackfen, Kent.

He had blood tests and x-rays at both Queen Mary’s Hospital in Sidcup and Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, but doctors could not figure out what was wrong with his hand.

Venomous: Alex Michael's hand swelled up after he was bitten by the false black widow spider

It was only when Mr Michael put a photo online of a spider online that friends recognised the dangerous animal.

Mr Michael made the connection between the spider and his swollen hand and captured the culprit in a pot to take with him to Darent Valley Hospital in Kent.

'I said I’m going to let this spider go in your office and if it bites you I’m going to follow you to where you get it sorted,' he said.

'Eventually they took it pretty seriously.'

Doctors gave him a course of the antibiotic flucloxacillin and within days, the swelling reduced and the pain disappeared.

The 2in-long spider, known by experts as Steatoda noblis or 'noble false widow', unleashes a powerful venom when provoked which can kill those who are allergic to it.

Wound: Mr Michael's finger remained swollen for weeks and he visited three hospitals for tests and x-rays

Mr Michael, a tattooist, explained he only realised he’d been attacked by a spider when he posted a picture online.

He said: 'I I put a picture of the spider on Facebook saying, "Have I found a new species?"

'Within minutes people replied saying "It is dangerous, don’t touch it."

'I went back to the doctor and he didn’t believe me. He said, "What website did you get that (picture) off?"

'I said it was taken in my kitchen. He went online and I saw his face drop.

'He said, "You could be right about this. It could be a spider bite."'

No deaths have ever been confirmed in the UK from a false widow spider bite.

It is thought their numbers have increased in recent years due to milder winters and warmer summers that some put down to global warming.

London Wildlife Trust conservation ecologist Tony Wileman said: 'Reports from false widow spider bites have included symptoms like chest pains and a swelling and tingling of the bite area, usually the fingers.

'If bitten then visit A&E, do not ring 999.

'Ideally and if possible the spider should be caught in a jar so it can be identified.'

Natural History Museum spider expert Stuart Hine said there have been a lot of sightings of the spiders in recent weeks.

He said: 'It's spider season. A lot of species mature in the autumn. When it’s hot and humid, we leave our doors and windows open, and that allows the spiders in.'
