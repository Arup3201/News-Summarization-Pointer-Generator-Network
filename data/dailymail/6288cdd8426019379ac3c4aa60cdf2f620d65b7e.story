Cookie brand Oreo has finally put its fans out of their misery and confirmed that it will be launching a new red velvet flavor to its limited edition line-up - just in time for Valentine's Day. 

Much like the iconic cupcake that helped to inspire it, Oreo's newest sandwich cookie flavor features a red-colored chocolate cookie base and a cream cheese frosting-flavored filling, making a move away from the original cookies and cream flavor that the brand is best known for.

Rumors about the new cookie flavor first began back in October, when a tweet was published featuring a picture of what appeared to be the new Red Velvet Oreo packaging.

But, determined to keep the new sweet treat under the radar until 2015, the brand remained quiet about the tweet, which was soon deleted from the site, prompting some cookie fans to question whether the image was indeed a hoax.

'You may remember that a few months ago, there was speculation about an Oreo Red Velvet cookie,' a spokesperson for the brand explained to Daily Mail Online. 

'It’s true, but we just weren’t ready to reveal the news back then as [the flavor] wasn't going to be available in US stores nationwide until February 2 – but we’re ready to confirm, its official.'

The launch, which will no doubt be welcomed by long-time fans of the much-loved sandwich cookie, comes just four months after Daily Mail Online exclusively revealed Oreo's last limited edition flavor, pumpkin spice, which was introduced to customers during the fall season last year. 

But this latest flavor marks a new milestone for the brand, featuring the first new cookie flavor - and color - since the debut of its vanilla-flavored Golden Oreo in 2004. 

'Uniquely, Red Velvet Oreo features a new cookie flavor (and color) for the first time since the debut of our Golden Oreo,' the spokesperson added.

'The variety embodies a mix of the chocolate Oreo cookie taste fans love with a cream cheese-flavored crème for red velvet fanatics.'

But how does the new flavor fare when put to the ultimate taste test? 

US Femail Editor Tamara Abraham was happy with the overall result, but felt that the cookies needed to be brighter in order to capture the true red velvet effect. 

'They’re not as red as I’d hoped they’d be – and kind of taste like fake strawberry flavoring, in a good way,' she said, after trailing her first cookie. 

'There’s a definite hint of cream cheesiness that I like too.'

Sean Walsh, Daily Mail Online's Director of Communications, was thrilled with the new addition to the Oreo line-up however, saying: 'I would eat the whole packet – they taste like cake.'

Overall, it was agreed that the new cookies do a good job of capturing the true red velvet cake flavor, with US Femail Writer Erica Tempesta adding: 'They tasted just like a cupcake, and I was a fan of the cookie’s new color. 

'But they were a little too sweet to consume more than a couple, which is probably a good thing!'
