The common phrase 'pull your socks up' could mean nothing to future generations as knee-high socks fall out of favour with British blokes.

Flashing one's hairy ankle was once seen as a terrible fashion faux pas for men -Â  thus longer socks were an absolute necessity.

But demand for the woollen, knee-high stockings - which saved our soldiers from foot rot during World War One - has slumped.

Now you can't get away from naked 'mankles' on display, as modern men plump for ankle socks, ultra-short sport socks - or no socks at all.

Debenhams spokesman Ed Watson: 'Knee-length socks once conquered an empire, but now they seem to be fading into history.'

Officers had socks made of a softer, finer weave, while lower ranks had to make do with coarser material.

Thousands of British women knitted long socks to send to the troops during both World Wars and, so important were they, that the Imperial War Museum celebrated the tradition with a collection of knee-high socks worn by British military personnel over the decades.

The socks didn't just make an appearance when it was cold, soldiers also wore them in hot countries, like India.

They trickled into lives of British 
civilians, with many gentlemen wearing them together with calf garters to prevent them 
from slipping down the leg.

Employees at the General Electric Company knit socks and scarves for WWI soldiers in 1918

Since then, though, their popularity has been in freefall. Modern, lightweight shoes makes
wearing thick woollen socks impractical and uncomfortable.

Watson 
believes it is the end of an era.

He added: 'While there are still some men who refuse to part with tradition, knee-high socks are now worn primarily by school children and Swiss yodelling champions.

'It's a shame because these socks served the country well.

'Now it seems that we have become a nation in danger of losing its sole.'

British soldiers lead away German soldiers, who crashed their plane in 1940 - they would all have worn long socks

British soldiers - who would have worn long woolly socks even in hot countries - guard the financial section of Bombay, India, following an outbreak of looting in 1947
