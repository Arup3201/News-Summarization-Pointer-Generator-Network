Tory MP Douglas Carswell said the Conservatives were 'haemorrhaging' membership because Cameron and his 'remote clique' at Westminster were not listening to ordinary people's views

The Conservative Party last night point blank refused to reveal how many members it has amid claims the total may have plummeted below 100,000.

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said the party was ‘haemorrhaging’ membership because David Cameron and his ‘remote clique’ at Westminster were not listening to the views of ordinary people.

Meanwhile UKIP has seen membership soar to as many as 40,000 as the party captures the attention of former Tories with its anti-EU rhetoric.

Tory central office said it never commented on its membership figures, prompting critics to claim the silence must mean they are ‘horrific’.

Former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft tweeted: ‘We still have not received the membership numbers for the Conservative Party.

'Sadly I suspect it’s really bad.’

Labour and the Liberal Democrats both publish membership figures.

Although both have seen numbers fall, the Labour figure of 187,537 is still far higher than the rumoured Conservative total.

A Labour source said: ‘Tory chairman Grant Shapps is repeatedly refusing to answer straightforward questions about their membership.

‘While we have a healthy membership 
gearing up to knock on doors at the next election, the Tories’ silence 
indicates they will face real problems.’

Membership going down the pan, David? Tory central office said it never commented on its membership figures, prompting critics to claim the silence must mean they are 'horrific'

Although they will not reveal membership figures, the Tories’ accounts do say how much money is raised from membership fees, which suggest that numbers have fallen. 

In 2012, the total amount raised in fees was £747,000 – down 28 per cent from the £1,031,000 two years earlier.

Meanwhile, some Tory associations have revealed their membership figures, many of which were very low.

For example, marginal Halesowen and Rowley Regis in the West Midlands has only 79 members.

Such tiny levels of support make it very difficult to raise money for local campaigns or get enough people to knock on doors during elections.

Mr Carswell – whose Clacton constituency has seen membership soar 60 per cent since the election – said some associations existed only on paper because there were so few supporters willing to pay up.

Former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft tweeted: 'We still have not received the membership numbers for the Conservative Party. Sadly I suspect it's really bad'

He told the BBC’s Newsnight programme: ‘We’re still doing politics like it’s the 1950s and we wonder why we’re haemorrhaging membership.

‘It matters enormously if political parties shrivel because if they exist only on paper, as I’m afraid in many Conservative associations is now the case, what you end up with is a remote clique in Westminster who run the party as private property with a few local franchises, and people feel disengaged.’

Mr Carswell said people did not want to join up because party members no longer had any power, unlike in the 1970s and 1980s when they could vote on policies at annual conferences.

He continued: ‘It’s a little bit like those banks that don’t want to reveal what’s on their balance sheet because there’s some bad news lurking there.

‘I suspect it is going to be horrific. I suspect it is going to be lower than 100,000 but if we fess up to if we can start to fix it.’

Meanwhile Paul Goodman, from the Conservative Home activists website, said he believed membership was between 100,000 and 130,000.

Writing on Conservative Home, he said: ‘Ed Miliband wants trade union members to be able to opt into Labour Party membership.

‘There are roughly six million members of trade unions in the United Kingdom. Were even a paltry five per cent of them to join Labour as individual members, its membership could climb to three times that of the Conservatives.

‘There is no time like the present for David Cameron to face up to the fact that the party is dying on its feet, and act to revive it.’

Tory central office says it is impossible to provide a figure because the information is largely held by local associations who hold the overwhelming majority of memberships locally.

They say a comprehensive picture is difficult to ascertain due to the fact that most local associations provide their figures only when it comes to a leadership ballot, the last of which was held in 2005 when Mr Cameron was elected.

Membership was then around 260,000.

A Conservative spokesman said: ‘The Party does not comment on its membership figures.’
