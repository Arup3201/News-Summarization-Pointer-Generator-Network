The U.N. Committee against
Torture urged the United States on Friday to fully investigate
and prosecute police brutality and shootings of unarmed black
youth and ensure that taser weapons are used only in
life-threatening situations.

The panel's first review of the U.S. record on preventing
torture since 2006 came in the wake of racially-tinged unrest in
cities across the United States this week sparked by a Ferguson,
Missouri grand jury's decision not to charge a white police
officer for the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager.

The committee decried 'excruciating pain and prolonged
suffering' endured by prisoners during 'botched executions' as
well as frequent rapes of inmates, shackling of pregnant women
in some prisons, and extensive use of solitary confinement.

The review cited deep concern about 'numerous reports' of
police brutality and excessive use of force against people from
minority groups, immigrants and homosexuals as well as racial
profiling and militarisation of policing work.

It referred to the 'frequent and recurrent police shootings
or fatal pursuits of unarmed black individuals.'

The U.S. delegation told the 10 independent experts on the
panel that 20 investigations had been opened since 2009 into
systematic police abuses and that more than 330 police officers
had been prosecuted for brutality.

The U.N. panel said there was insufficient information
available on the result of those investigations.

It spoke of 'numerous and consistent' reports that U.S.
police have used tasers against unarmed people resisting arrest
and condemned two recent cases of death in Florida and Illinois.

Tasers should be used only in extreme cases to prevent loss
of life or serious injury, the committee said.

It criticized what it called a continued U.S. failure to
fully investigate allegations of torture and ill-treatment of
terrorism suspects held in U.S. custody abroad, 'evidenced by
the limited number of criminal prosecutions and convictions.'

Some 148 inmates are held at the U.S. Guantanamo base in
Cuba amid reports, the committee's report said, of 'a draconian
system of secrecy surrounding high-value detainees that keeps
their torture claims out of the public domain.'

Nine inmates have died, including seven by suicide, since
2006, the report added.

It called for declassifying evidence of torture and detainee
abuse committed during former President George W. Bush's
administration, and for prosecuting those responsible.
