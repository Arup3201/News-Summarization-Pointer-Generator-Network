England's hopes of unleashing Manu Tuilagi in the Six Nations appear to be slim after the Leicester centre revealed that he is unlikely to be fit before the end of next month.

Initial medical reports suggested the 23-year-old would be back in action by Christmas after suffering a groin injury in October, but his recovery has been hit by several setbacks and he could now miss the Tests against Wales, Italy and Ireland.

Stuart Lancaster was short of options without Tuilagi’s physicality during the autumn internationals, and the England coach will once again turn to his midfield reserves when he names his squad on Wednesday for the next campaign, which kicks off in Cardiff on February 6.

Leicester Tigers centre Manu Tuilagi has been struggling with a groin injury since October 

Tuilagi could miss the games against Wales, Italy and Ireland after several injury setbacks in recent months 

‘It’s slow but it’s getting there,’ said Tuilagi. ‘The end of February would be all right — that would be ideal but I have to get this right. It’s not like a sprained ankle you can strap it up and get on with it. I have to make sure that if I need to take another week or two then I take it.

‘When it first happened the doctor said it would be six to eight weeks. I was pretty happy then. When I realised it was going to be longer it was hard to stay focused mentally because it’s my second time out for a long time, after a pectoral injury. It’s part of the game, you have to ride it out and come back.’

Tuilagi suffered a heavy strain to his adductor, which tore away from his pubis bone during the Champions Cup tie against Ulster. Surgery is not seen as an effective means to fix the problem, so prolotherapy treatment has been used to aid the recovery. ‘It’s a sugar injection that goes straight into the bone and it basically holds it together like chewing gum sticking together,’ said Tuilagi.

Tuilagi has not featured for England since the three-Test summer tour of New Zealand in 2014 

‘Those injections worked really well. When I did it I could hardly walk and could feel the pubis going up and down but now it works really well. With the pubis, not many people have operations there as it’s quite hard to get fixed.’

While England are still scratching heads over their best combinations for the World Cup, Wales have a far more settled feel about their squad. Warren Gatland will name his Six Nations party this morning and the Kiwi is expected to call upon his countryman, Gareth Anscombe, who won the Junior World Cup with New Zealand. The No 10 joined the Blues from Waikato Chiefs in November and is eligible for selection through his Cardiff-born mother.

Anscombe will compete with Ospreys fly-half Dan Biggar for the starting jersey, but hopes of a call-up for Leicester’s Owen Williams were looking slim when the selection committee convened yesterday afternoon.

Sportsmail understands that, despite his decision to turn down a return to Wales, Williams was in the running last week, before he was dropped ahead of a potential showdown with Rhys Priestland in Leicester’s Champions Cup tie against the Scarlets on Friday.

Scotland fly-half Duncan Weir will miss the Six Nations and could be out for up to four months after surgery on his right bicep.
