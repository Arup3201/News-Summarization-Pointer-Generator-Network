Ukip is storming ahead of the Conservatives when it comes to pleasing right-of-centre voters on policies of government spending, immigration and gay marriage, a poll revealed today.

The voters, who are undecided over which of the two parties to vote for, also told the survey that Ukip's Nigel Farage is a better party leader than Prime Minister David Cameron by 37 to 32 per cent.

The ‘switchers’ would prefer London Mayor Boris Johnson to Mr Cameron as Tory leader and would put Home Secretary Theresa May in third place, the ICM survey for The Sunday Telegraph said.

The findings come two weeks after Ukip pushed the Conservatives into an embarrassing third place in the by-election in Eastleigh, Hampshire, which was won by the Lib Dem candidate Mike Thornton.

There are concerns within the Tory party that Ukip will split their vote at the local elections in May, which could result in a strong result for Labour and put even more pressure on Mr Cameron.

But the poll revealed that Mr Cameron’s policy on holding an ‘in/out’ referendum on Britain's EU membership is favoured by all voters when compared to Ukip’s plan of leaving immediately.

The ICM poll overall gave Labour a six-point lead on 36 per cent, with the Tories on 30 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent, when asking voters to predict the next general election result.

The ‘switchers’ favour Ukip’s immigration policies over those of the Tories by 62 to 34 per cent, and 51 per cent oppose same-sex marriage in line with Ukip, compared to 39 per cent in support.

When looking at government spending - covering health, pensioners and global aid - 64 per cent of ‘switchers’ favour Ukip’s policies, compared to just 28 per cent for the Tories.

The Tories suffered even more grim opinion poll news when Ukip hit a record 17 per cent in the ComRes poll for the Independent on Sunday and Sunday Mirror - firmly cementing its third place.

Support for the Prime Minister's Tories fell three points to 28 per cent, with Labour nine points ahead after gaining one point to 37 per cent and the Lib Dems also up one on 9 per cent.

But by a majority of 38 per cent to 28 per cent, those polled said the Tories were more likely to win if they kept Mr Cameron as leader, following a bout of speculation of a challenge.
