Lydia Bishop died on her first day of nursery

Two nursery workers have been arrested after a three-year-old girl died when she got entangled in a rope while playing on a slide on her first day in day care.

Police said the workers at York College Day Nursery were arrested on Monday and interviewed as part of ongoing inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death of Lydia Bishop on September 17.

An inquest opening on Monday heard nursery staff and paramedics tried to save Lydia with CPR after she was found unresponsive on a slide in the outdoor playground with a rope tangled around her neck, it emerged today.

York coroner Donald Coverdale said a number of children went to play outside some time after 2pm and it was believed that Lydia - whose first day it was at the nursery - wanted to use the slide.

'There came a time when a nursery worker spotted Lydia unresponsive on the slide, and there was a rope which had been attached to play equipment which was around her neck,' he said, opening the inquest into Lydia's death.

'I understand that staff immediately gave what help they could, administering CPR until paramedics arrived,' he said.

The coroner said resuscitation attempts continued after the paramedics had taken Lydia to York Hospital, but it proved impossible to revive her, and it was confirmed at 3.27pm that she had died.

A consultant pathologist, Dr Nigel Cooper, later carried out a post mortem examination and said the provisional cause of death was 'pressure on the neck.'

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said the workers have been bailed until October 26 pending further inquiries, adding: 'The investigation is still in its early stages and it is not possible to comment further at this time.'

Police have declined to comment on the exact charges the duo were arrested on.

York College confirmed two members of its nursery staff had been interviewed by police as part of the investigation. The nursery is to remain closed until early next month while investigations continue.

The college added: 'We will continue to assist the investigating authorities in every way we can.

'Our sincere condolences remain with Lydia's family and our thoughts are with them and the staff, parents and children of the nursery who have been affected by this tragic event. We continue to do all we can to support those involved.'
