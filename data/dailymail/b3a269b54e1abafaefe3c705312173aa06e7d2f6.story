A mother who suffered an incomprehensible tragedy just two years ago showed the incredible power of forgiveness this holiday season.

Amanda Humphrey of Kansas City, Missouri watched in horror on September 16, 2012 as her daughter Autumn was struck and killed by a car driven by 88-year-old Lewis Grace, just weeks before her first birthday.

And this holiday season at the First Baptist Church of North Kansas City, Amanda recounted the tragedy and spoke of forgiveness before walking back to her seat and shocking many by embracing the man who killed her daughter - Lewis Grace.

Lewis Grace was driving the car that ran over Amanda and Richard's daughter Autumn in September of 2012

The incident happened at the First Baptist Church where Lewis accidentally accelerated while the car was in reverse 

The Kansas City Star reports that it was a Sunday after church when the accident occurred, with Lewis hitting Autumn's grandfather and aunt when he accidentally hit his accelerator and backed into the group.

'We relive the accident every day in our minds — for those of us that were there, that is our cross we bear,' explained Amanda.

'Then the car ride over to the hospital, the whole time thinking this has to be a dream! Then walking into the ER, the walk to her ER room seemed to be the longest walk in the world. All we wanted was to be with Autumn and comfort her.'

A short time later Autumn was pronounced dead, and Amanda and her husband Richard were left to rebuild their lives.

A week later however, things took a remarkable turn when at her daughter's funeral Amanda asked to see Lewis.

Amanda hugged the distraught man, still suffering from what had happened, and asked if he and his wife Louise would sit with them as they remembered Autumn.

'They go to this church; they had been members of this church longer than we had,' said Amanda. 

'I wanted him to understand that we really did forgive him and that we wanted him to be a part of this with us and grieve with us and know that it’s OK.'

After that Amanda says it was the power of prayer that helped the couple as they tried to cope with their loss.

The couple also received a blessing on August 12, 2013 with the birth of their son Tommy. 

'We love being parents,' said Amanda.

And as she delivered her church speech this holiday season and told her story, she later brought her son over to Lewis, and the man held the young boy in his lap.

'Sometimes as adults we find ourselves in situations that we could only imagine what we would do,' said Amanda as she spoke to the congregation.

'Whether you would forgive a person for wrecking your car, or stealing your bike. You could come up with ideas in your head about what you would do or say to those people.'

She ended by saying; 'But sometimes, when those things actually do happen to you, God steps in just when you least expect it. He has a way of changing our mind and our actions, without us ever knowing it.'
