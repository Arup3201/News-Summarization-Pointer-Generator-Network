Family doctors are unhappy about their pay despite seeing fewer patients at evenings and weekends, according to a major report.

The proportion of surgeries which open on Saturdays and Sundays has fallen by a third in two years, while there has been a seven per cent drop in those offering evening appointments.

Yet GPs are unhappier with their jobs than ever before – and particularly with their pay.

Unhappy: One in five GPs want more money and one in ten are thinking of quitting medicine altogether

More than one in five, or 22.5 per cent, are ‘dissatisfied’ with salaries, and one in ten are so unhappy with their careers overall that they are considering quitting.

Family doctors earn £104,000 a year on average and their pay has increased by 50 per cent from a decade ago thanks to a lucrative deal agreed by Labour that allowed them to opt out of out-of-hours work.

The contract, introduced in 2004, also lets them earn bonuses by monitoring patients with certain long-term conditions.

As a result of the agreement, most surgeries now subcontract out-of-hours work to private firms, which critics fear are more concerned with profits than patient care.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is in the process of negotiating a new contract with GPs, which could see a return to routine out-of-hours work.

The study by the University of  Manchester, commissioned by the Department of Health, found just 22.5 per cent of GPs do any out-of-hours shifts.

Those who do take on only four hours a week on average. The survey of 1,189 GPs found 10 per cent work at weekends, down from 15 per cent two years ago.

Ten years ago, before the Labour contract, nearly all GPs worked out of hours, with those at smaller practices on call several nights a week.

Roger Goss of campaign group Patient Concern said: ‘It’s ludicrous, our GPs are amongst the best-paid in the world.

'GP services and the NHS are meant to be all about continuity of care, yet this has been destroyed by family doctors being able to opt out of working out  of hours.

‘Most patients – especially the  elderly – want to see the same doctor but the present situation means they have to explain their problems to an unfamiliar face every single time.

‘In many areas the GP services are appalling.’

Renegotiation: Health secretary Jeremy Hunt is drawing up new contracts with GPs

Only a third of GPs (32 per cent) said their surgery opened on Saturdays and Sundays, compared to 39 per cent two years earlier.

And 76 per cent offered evening appointments, down from 81 per cent two years ago.

The lack of availability of GPs has been partly blamed for the crisis in A&E departments, with soaring numbers of patients turning up as they don’t know where else to go.

This week the Health Secretary told GPs to provide better care for elderly and vulnerable patients to keep them out of casualty.

Katherine Murphy, of the Patients’ Association, said: ‘There is no doubt patients are finding it extremely hard to get an appointment.

'People also tell us that their once-friendly GP now has little time for conversation.

‘It seems as if GPs are at a very low ebb and they are being expected to provide more care for vulnerable patients outside of hospital without being given the necessary resources.’

The research, which was carried out through questionnaires, found 8.9 per cent of GPs are considering quitting or moving to a managerial role.

GPs’ stress levels, measured on a scale of one to seven, are the highest since the survey began in 2000, having steadily increased across 15 categories including workload, dealing with complaints and long hours.

Meanwhile 22.5 per cent of GPs said they were unhappy with their pay and 36.7 per cent with their hours of work.

Family doctors say that although they do not have to work out-of-hours, their job is becoming harder because patients are older, frailer and often have a number of serious illnesses that need monitoring.

In addition, they warn increases in paperwork and targets leave them less time to see patients.

Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the GPs committee chairman at doctors’ union the British Medical Association, said: ‘General practice is under real pressure from spiralling patient demand, especially from an ageing population, and falling resources.

‘Recent increases in targets and pointless box ticking have added another damaging level of bureaucracy that is diverting valuable time away from treating patients.

GPs want to work with the Government to improve patient care and to be freed from the administrative nightmare that is adding unnecessary  workload to an already overstretched service.’

Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie, who sits on the Health Select Committee, said: ‘GPs are under incredible stress and there is a flood of new demand.

‘This is partly due to the aging population but also younger patients are more aware of their rights and are more inclined to argue back.’

Mr Hunt is currently negotiating a new GPs’ contract with  doctors’ organisations including the BMA. The details will be announced later this year.

Stunning: Dr Simon Fradd, pictured here as Master of a City livery company, helped negotiate the deal

He has a £1.6million apartment overlooking the Thames and a handsome income from his private healthcare firm.

In 2004, Dr Simon Fradd and his British Medical Association colleagues helped forge the deal securing their members a 50 per cent pay rise.

The deal also allowed GPs to give up out-of-hours work.

For more than half a century that responsibility was at the heart of GPs’ contract of care.

But the Labour government let them opt out, docking them just £6,000 each.

‘It was just stunning really,’ Dr Fradd, 63, said in 2007.

‘Stunning in that no one in my position had ever believed we could pull it off.’

He had at first thought GPs’ pay would be docked up to £50,000 if they wanted to opt out of working out-of-hours. 

Dr Fradd then set up Concordia Health to offer those very same services, only now at a profit to himself.
