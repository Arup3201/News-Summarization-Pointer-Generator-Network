Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said sex attackers were 'getting away with it'

The conviction rate for sex crimes plummeted by 10 per cent last year as an increasing number of attackers 'got away with it', new figures have revealed.

Despite more than 5,000 extra prosecutions in the year to June  only 77 more sex offenders were convicted.

It means that just six out of 10 prosecutions for sex offences resulted in a prosecution - down from 70 per cent the year before.

Labour claimed more offenders were getting away with their crimes and blamed Government cuts to police officers and specialist prosecutors for a failure to deal with complex sex crimes.

The figures show there were 34,161 sex offence prosecutions in the year ending June 2014, with 19,685 resulting in a conviction.

But a similar number of sex offenders - 19,608 - were convicted in the year ending June 2013, despite only 28,809 prosecutions, more than 5,000 fewer.

In contrast the conviction rate for every other serious crime apart from robbery increased or remained the same over the same period.

The release of the figures in the MoJ's quarterly criminal justice statistics comes as the prosecution and conviction of sexual offenders remains high on the political agenda after a string of high profile cases.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Government should establish national standards on the prosecution of sex crimes.

She said: ‘These figures show the Government is failing to get justice for victims of sexual attacks and abuse.

‘More sex offenders are getting away with it, and fewer victims are getting the justice and protection they need. The scale of cuts to police officers and specialist prosecutors under Theresa May means they are struggling to cope with complex crimes.' 

Labour accused Theresa May of overseeing plummeting conviction rates for sex offences. Despite more than 5,000 extra prosecutions last year there were only 77 more sex offenders convicted

Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive of the charity Victim Support, said: ‘We know from supporting many thousands of victims of sexual offences that after getting up the courage to come forward to testify, they can feel devastated if their case ends without a guilty verdict.

‘Successful convictions are often dependent on victims and witnesses being able to give their best possible evidence to the court.

‘Victim Support is on hand to provide them with the help and support they need.

‘Agencies across the criminal justice system must address this drop in conviction rates, not least as sexual offences have some of the lowest conviction rates compared to other crimes.’
