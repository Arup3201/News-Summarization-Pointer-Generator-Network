Suspect: Kenneth Gillespie who is linked to a raid on a McDonalds in Ipswich could not be charged despite having £5,500 in cash on him

When robbers snatched £17,000 from a security guard outside a McDonald’s, police had a pretty good idea who might have done it.

A short distance away, three criminals – including two robbers – were employed on day release from prison.

One was found with more than £5,500 in cash in his pocket and a nearby shed, and refused to say where it came from.

Another matched the description of a one-legged man acting suspiciously in the restaurant.

But extraordinarily, none will face charges because the Crown Prosecution Service says there is insufficient evidence.

Despite this, the money has been confiscated after magistrates decided that, on the balance of probability, it had been taken in the raid.

And Kenneth Gillespie, 59, the man found with the cash, is now on the run after absconding from another open prison.

The astonishing story began when a security guard was collecting takings from the McDonald’s in Ipswich on November 7, 2011, and was approached by two able-bodied men.

They shoved her to the ground as they snatched a case she was carrying and ran away.

Within hours Suffolk Police had arrested Gillespie and two unnamed men aged 36 and 44.

One was a one-legged man who was shown on CCTV hobbling into the restaurant on crutches.

It is understood he later confirmed he had been there – but only to get food.

Crime scene: The McDonald's in Ipswich, Suffolk, where a G4S security guard was pushed to the ground and £17,000 was stolen in November 2011

All three were on a work placement a 
mile away at Ipswich Town Football Club after being allowed out of 
Hollesley Bay open prison, near Woodbridge.

Police found £5,513 in Gillespie’s 
pocket and a paint shed at the football ground, to which he held a key. 
None of the rest of the stolen cash has been recovered.

During a hearing under the Proceeds 
of Crime Act at South East Suffolk Magistrates’ Court, Suffolk Police’s 
Andrew Morrison said: ‘Mr Gillespie was identified as being a possible 
suspect and the key being found in his possession that would open the 
paint store would lend itself [to believing] that the money was involved
in that robbery.’

But prosecutor Karly McGuire said the
case had not met the burden of proof required to bring charges. She 
also revealed Gillespie had absconded from another open prison, North 
Sea Camp in Boston, Lincolnshire.

Open prison: Kenneth Gillespie had been serving a life sentence at Hollesley Bay in Woodbridge, Suffolk

He has been at large since failing to return from day release on January 23.

Gillespie was given six life 
sentences at the Old Bailey in 2000 for carrying out a series  of armed 
robberies at betting shops before escaping on  a bicycle.

The career criminal, who has 
convictions dating back to the 1970s, was on licence at the time after 
being sentenced to nine years for a robbery plot.

A CPS spokesman said: ‘We have made 
the decision not to charge in this case due to the lack of essential 
forensic evidence. It would be difficult to prove a link between the 
defendant and the alleged offence.

‘The defendant could not be identified by independent witnesses. If any new evidence comes to light, the case can be reviewed.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
