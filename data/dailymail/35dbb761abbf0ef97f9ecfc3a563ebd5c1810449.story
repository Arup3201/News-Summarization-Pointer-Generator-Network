Suicide bombers killed 40 people and wounded more than 100 yesterday in twin blasts that ripped through an upmarket and heavily guarded district of the Syrian capital Damascus.

One explosion gouged a 6ft deep crater into the ground.

The blasts came a day after an advance team of Arab League observers arrived in the country to monitor Syria’s promise to end its crackdown on protesters demanding the overthrow of President Bashar Assad.

The United Nations said the uprising had left 5,000 dead and thousands more detained.

The Syrian authorities immediately pointed the finger at possible Al Qaeda involvement.

Within hours, government officials 
took the observers to the scene of the explosions outside intelligence 
service buildings in the upscale Kfar Sousa district.

Mutilated and torn
bodies still lay amid rubble, twisted debris and burned cars.

The officials said the outrage backed 
their long-time claims that the turmoil is not a popular uprising but 
the work of terrorists. A Syrian foreign ministry spokesman said Lebanon
had warned it two days ago that an Al Qaeda cell had entered Syria from
its territory.

But an opposition leader raised doubts
over the authorities’ version of the events, suggesting the regime was 
pitching its case to the observers.

Omar Idilbi of the Syrian National 
Council, an umbrella group of regime opponents, called the explosions 
‘very mysterious because they happened in heavily guarded areas that are
difficult to be penetrated by a car’.

He said: ‘The presence of the 
observers pushed the regime to give this story in order to scare the 
committee from moving around Syria.’ He stopped short of blaming the 
regime for the blasts.

David Hartwell, Middle East analyst at
IHS Jane’s in London, said the timing of the bombs ‘is certain to be 
viewed with suspicion by the opposition’.

The Syrian government escalated its 
crackdown on protesters ahead of the Arab League observers’ arrival on 
Thursday. More than 200 were killed in two days this week.
