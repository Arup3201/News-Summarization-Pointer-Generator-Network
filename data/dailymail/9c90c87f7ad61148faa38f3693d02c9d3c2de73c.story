Wrong turn: Former 'officer of the year' Mitchell Wright is now in jail facing a host of drug charges

A former deputy with the Seattle police department is in jail, accused of recruiting strippers to work as drug mules and dealers for him in an attempt to take over the drug trade in suburban Shoreline.

Mitchell Wright, 33, is facing a host of state and federal charges related to the distribution of methamphetamine, heroin and cocaine.

The 10-year King County police force veteran, who was also a task-force officer for the Drug Enforcement Agency, was fired last July after an internal investigation was launched that revealed he had stolen drugs seized by the DEA to the value of about $50,000.

He was arrested in August 2013 and 
charged with felony theft and heroin possession. According to Seattle 
PI, he was alleged to have stolen 1,600 oxycodone pills, a half-pound of
 benzodiazepine and about a teaspoon of cocaine.

Wright
 made a series of bizarre claims after he was arrested, including that 
he was immune to prosecution as an Australian diplomat, a King County 
detective told the court.

'He
 also stated that he had a job lined up in Australia that was going to 
pay him $400,000 a year and that he had terminal bone cancer and only 
had six months to live,' the detective said in state court filings, 
reports Seattle PI.

'He then continued that this investigation was one big misunderstanding.'

Wright was released on bail weeks later and subsequently seen at the home of a suspected drug dealer. A joint investigation between the King County detectives and the DEA was launched.

An informant told a DEA detective that Wright was recruiting strippers to sell methamphetamine and heroin for him by giving them 'free samples.'

He was allegedly sampling the goods himself, using large amounts of meth which made him paranoid yet defiant and convinced he could not be caught.

'Wright bragged to [the informant] and his criminal associates that he could never be caught or arrested, as he knew all of the tricks that police use to investigate drug dealers,' the detective said in court papers.

He allegedly had plans to become the drug kingpin in North Seattle.

The dirty cop, who was named 'Shoreline Officer of the Year' seven years ago, was arrested again on February 5 outside a burger joint.

According to Seattle PI, he scuffled with officers and attempted to throw away a glasses case fulled with meth, cocaine and heroin. Officers described him as 'extremely agitated' and said he appeared to be under the influence of methamphetamine at the time of his arrest.

More outlandish claims followed, with officers reporting Wright claiming he'd fallen in love with a police informant, whom the prosecution would not be able to call as a witness because they were sleeping together.

Wright has pleaded not guilty to the latest charges and remains jailed at the Federal Detention Center at SeaTac. His trial is due to begin in April.
