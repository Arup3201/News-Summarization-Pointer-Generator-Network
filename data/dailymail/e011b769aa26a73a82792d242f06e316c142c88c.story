A 68-year-old woman who was arrested for having sex in public in a Florida retirement village has been sentenced to six months prison.

Margaret 'Peggy' Klemm, 68, had sex with 49-year-old David Bobilya at the pavilion at Lake Sumter Landing Market Square at around 10:30pm on June 2.

The pair were arrested for public indecency just days after Klemm was given probation in court for drunk driving in a golf court in the retirement village.

Harsh sentence: Klemm cries at her sentencing hearing as she's given six months jail time for her public indiscretion

Harsh sentence: Klemm cares for her husband who lost his leg to cancer and the pair have been putting her legal fees on credit cards, says their son

Supportive: Peggy Klemm's husband of 50 years Frank Klemm says his wife is a 'super woman' who deserves a 'second chance'

The Smoking Gun
 reports that when investigators arrived at the scene, a popular spot 
for nightly entertainment, Klemm had her shirt pulled down and wasn't 
wearing any pants.

Bobilya's pants and underwear were pulled down all the way to his ankles.

Police
 say that Klemm and Bobilya both seemed to be intoxicated but that they 
followed police officers' orders and put their clothing back on.

Klemm pleaded guilty in a plea deal. Her attorney said her sentence could have been up to one year in jail.

As she was sentenced, a tearful Klemm mouthed 'I love you' to her husband of 50 years Frank Klemm.

'She is a super woman as far as I'm concerned,' Frank Klemm told Click Orlando following the hearing.

'And she deserves a second chance. That's all I have to say.'

The mother of four and grandmother of 14 cares for her husband, who lost a leg to cancer.

Bobilya is also serving a six-month sentence on the same charges.

In The Villages local newspaper, many letters to the editor have protested the harshness of Klemm's sentence.

Her son, Steve Klemm, wrote a heartfelt letter in defense of his mother.

'She’s one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet,' he wrote on July 19, describing his mother's impoverished childhood and the hardships she's endured.

'She’s the one that carried her son, David, for 9 months and then had to bury him soon after...  She’s the one who’s cared for her husband who lost his entire leg to cancer 25 years ago.  She’s the one who cut back on living expenses, worked as a caregiver to the elderly, and saved her pennies to help pay for a home in The Villages, Florida.  It was her “dream come true.” Peggy’s husband is paying legal fees with a credit card and hoping he can bring her home soon.'

Klemm received credit for time served and has 135 days left in jail.video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player
