Wbaltv reported that, after a witness called police, the victims were able to point police in the direction the gunmen fled.

During the chase, the suspects allegedly threw a handgun from the stolen vehicle, which was later recovered by police.

Investigators said the gunmen abandoned the vehicle on Tyler Court and fled on foot. Both were captured by police and arrested.

Both were being held at the Annapolis Police Department on Sunday with charges pending.Â 

Once charged, they were expected to be taken directly to the District Court Commissioner for their initial hearing.

The pregnant woman, who has not been identified, was taken to Anne Arundel Medical Center. There are no updates on her condition.
