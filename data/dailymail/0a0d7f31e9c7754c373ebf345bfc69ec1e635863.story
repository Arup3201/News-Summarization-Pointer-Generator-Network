The Guardian newspaper sent top-secret files containing classified information to the United States by household courier FedEx, it was revealed last night.

The security risk is the latest to engulf the newspaper after the head of MI5 warned last week that publication of confidential data leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden had caused huge ‘harm’ to the capability of Britain’s intelligence services.

Last night, senior security figures lambasted the newspaper for using Federal Express to carry the encrypted files.

'Huge damage': The leaks from former intelligence worker Edward Snowden, pictured here received an award while in exile in Moscow, have been condemned by intelligence experts

Former anti-terror law watchdog Alex Carlile QC said the decision may have put the lives of British spies in danger.

‘I think it is astonishing that top-secret material has been placed in a public parcel delivery system,’ he said.

Security chiefs are also understood to be ‘very concerned’ at the use of a courier company. One source said: ‘Any leak like this is extremely concerning and part of that concern is the handling arrangements.’

The data – from GCHQ, the Government’s secret communications headquarters – was copied from the original Snowden cache on to a USB memory stick and sent by FedEx to a ‘disguised’ US intermediary in June this year. Measures were taken to ensure its safe passage.

He was told that if The Guardian was ‘muzzled’ he was to make sure the material was published on ProPublica, a not-for-profit New York website which publishes investigative journalism.

Weeks later, GCHQ officials visited the newspaper’s London offices to destroy computers and hard drives in the belief they had closed the security breach.

'Parlour games': The Guardian, edited by Alan Rusbridger, pictured, has been accused of endangering MI5 and MI6 agents

The decision to send the files by courier is believed to have been taken within days of Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger returning from America, where he had been working with the Guardian’s New York office on how to handle the fall-out from the Snowden leaks.

Mr Rusbridger has since admitted he was worried the Government would seek an injunction to seize the material, preventing any further publication of the Snowden files.

According to a report last week in The New Yorker, Mr Rusbridger sent a ‘Federal Express package containing a thumbnail drive of selected Snowden documents to an intermediary in the US’.

The magazine told The Mail on Sunday that it stood by its story, which had been ‘multiple sourced’.

The Government only became aware that material may have been sent out of the country when Rusbridger met Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and the Prime Minister’s head of communications, Craig Oliver, at The Guardian’s offices on June 21.

According to The New Yorker, Rusbridger hinted that the Government might be too late to prevent publication of further material.

On July 20, The Guardian gave permission for officers from GCHQ to destroy hard drives holding the secret files at its King’s Cross offices.

Vulnerable: The Guardian reportedly uploaded a cache of intelligence files into a USB memory stick to send them to the USA

Two days later, The Guardian admitted to the Government that ‘secret material’ had been given to ProPublica.

It is not clear whether The Guardian told the intelligence  services that the material had been sent by FedEx, when it was sent or where from.

Last night, Stephen Engelberg, editor-in-chief of ProPublica, confirmed he had received the files.

He said: ‘The material is in our possession. It’s in a safe place. At one point we were told the Crown was going to ask for it back but they never did.’

He confirmed the memory stick ‘was sent’ but when asked how or from where, he said: ‘I’m not going to go into that... It came through.

'I don’t know how it got to me. It found its way through. We were prepared had they been injuncted to do what needed to be done’.

Last night, the revelations about the sending of secrets was branded ‘astonishing’ by Lord Carlile, who called on the Attorney General to consider legal action against the newspaper.

Lord Carlile accused The Guardian of playing ‘a parlour game’ with national security.

His comments are at odds with other leading Lib Dems, including Business Secretary Vince Cable, who have supported The Guardian.

Special delivery: The Guardian used the Fedex parcel service to deliver the files

He said: ‘I am very surprised The Guardian has not paid enough attention to comments by Andrew Parker [MI5 director general] and others about the damage these disclosures have done or can still do to national security.

'There are individuals whose safety might be affected by these disclosures. We are talking about MI5, MI6 and the national security agents of other countries.

'I think it is astonishing that a large amount of top-secret material has been placed in a public parcel delivery system.

'I think it is quite wrong that it should have been sent outside the country to avoid the jurisdiction of the UK courts.

'I hope the Attorney General will examine what The Guardian has done to determine whether there is any action to be taken. National security is not a parlour game.’

Attorney General Dominic Grieve could seek an injunction against The Guardian to deliver up the material.

'If refused, the editor would be in contempt of court and could be imprisoned for up to two years.

Last night, The Guardian refused to say how the material was sent. A spokesman said: ‘An encrypted form of a limited number of documents was safely sent to ProPublica. We’re not going to talk about what those documents were.’

In 2010, FedEx was at the centre of the printer bomb alert when an Al Qaeda bomb was found at its depot in Dubai.

And in 2006, a former employee admitted selling confidential account numbers of clients using FedEx’s London depot.

An earlier version of this article 
indicated that the number of files the Guardian FedExed to America was 
tens of thousands; the Guardian has since indicated that it numbered 
less than 100.

The newspaper also said that the files it FedExed to America did not contain any names of British spies.

Snowden's treachery has put the lives of our spies at risk: Comment by Richard Kemp, ex-chairman of COBRA intelligence committee

Richard Kemp, pictured, argues that Snowden's leaks have jeopardised national security

Despite the self-righteous pomposity of Edward Snowden, who claims from his FSB-protected  Moscow hideout that he doesn’t want to live in a society that places its citizens under surveillance, his revelations about the secret state have told us little.

GCHQ exists precisely to do what Snowden has ‘uncovered’. Who is genuinely surprised that, in its efforts to protect this country, GCHQ is monitoring all possible terrorist means of communication? Who wouldn’t be outraged if it were it not?

What Snowden has done by revealing the detail of collection techniques as well as vast quantities of highly sensitive intelligence material, is jeopardise our national security and the lives of those who take great risks to protect us.

To expose at the very least 58,000 secret and top secret British intelligence documents to the gaze of Chinese and Russian authorities and to publicise the details of intelligence collection capability is the most damaging act of betrayal in the history of intelligence treachery.

There is no question the Chinese and the Russians will be pulling out the stops to exploit this windfall.

The same applies to our tech-savvy jihadist enemies, who are more than capable of rapidly learning the lessons Snowden has taught them. I am no less troubled than anyone else about the extent to which private citizens are spied on.

In my opinion only one thing can justify the range and scale of activity that MI5, GCHQ and the NSA are engaged in. That is a serious and lethal threat to the people of this country. Today that threat comes from terrorism.

As a soldier I have fought terrorism and been attacked by terrorists. Involved in intelligence work in London, Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, I have read and analysed thousand upon thousand of secret intelligence reports including phone and email intercepts.

I know first-hand the danger that we face from terrorism and the vital role intelligence plays in protecting us from it.

Some 100 years ago Britain’s Naval Intelligence Division intercepted every message sent on transatlantic cables between Europe and the United States.

This was extremely risky as it involved intercepting communications between neutral powers, but nobody today would question its ultimate legitimacy or its value in defeating the Kaiser.

Compared with an all-out struggle for national survival, use of such measures in the shadowy fight against terrorism might seem harder to reconcile. But it is just  as important nontheless.

Few would argue with targeted surveillance against known suspects. But we cannot then ignore the unknown terrorists.

And in collecting information, the intelligence services have no choice but to collect material that has nothing to do with terrorism.

While working for the Joint Intelligence Committee and Cobra,  I was involved with many cases where GCHQ and NSA communications intelligence led directly to the disruption of terrorist activity both here in the UK and against British soldiers and civilians abroad.

Communications intercept has played a significant role in every important MI5 terrorist investigation since 9/11, with more than 330 suspects convicted of terrorism offences.

Snowden is only partially responsible for the harm that he has done. Far greater culpability lies with the US intelligence apparatus for permitting such damaging theft of their secret intelligence, especially in the wake of the Bradley Manning fiasco.

By bringing their clearly inadequate internal security measures up to date, the NSA can and must prevent recurrence of Snowden’s betrayal.
