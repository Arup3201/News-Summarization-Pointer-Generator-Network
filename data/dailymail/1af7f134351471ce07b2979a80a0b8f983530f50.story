American journalist Matthew Power has died in Uganda while working on an assignment for a men's magazine.

The 39-year-old had been accompanying a British explorer who was trekking along the Nile, for a feature in Men's Journal, when he suddenly became ill and died on Monday.

Power, who was spending the week walking with explorer Levinson Wood, is believed to have died from heat stroke and exhaustion.

The New York-based travel writer, who regularly worked for Outside, GQ, Men's Journal and other publications, died a few hours after losing consciousness on Monday.

The team he was with believe the death was caused by heat stroke, but the results of an autopsy have not yet been released. Temperatures in the area he was in had reached 88F this week.

Wood, the British explorer currently on a year-long attempt to become the first person to walk the length of the Nile, said he was 'shocked and saddened' by the sudden death.

The expedition had recently reached Murchinson Falls National Park, in what Wood had described on his Facebook page as a 'real test of endurance'. 

In a tribute to Power, Men's Journal described him as: 'A true adventurer and a principled, ethical journalist who never failed to put the accuracy of the story and the fairness in his depiction of a person, place, or situation above what worked for him as a writer'.

Power, who grew up in Vermont, had always wanted to be a writer. He started a course at Columbia University, but gave it up to do an internship at Harper's and has never looked back.

'I wanted to live my life, rather than the life that I figured the world expected of me, and thus far itâ€™s worked,' he told the Brooklyn Paper in 2006.

His friend and fellow writer Tom Bissell paid tribute to the adventurous reporter, whose work had included everything from a 5,000 mile motorbike trek through the Andes to detailing the dangers of conservationists.

'I suspect there was no place Matt wouldnâ€™t go, no kind of person he wouldnâ€™t want to meet,' Bissell wrote in a tribute on Long Read. 

'Through his talent and bravery, he took
 me and his thousands upon thousands of devoted readers around the 
world, to some of its loveliest, and most luckless, places.'

Respect: Friends and fellow writers, including Seth Mnookin and David Grann, paid tribute to Power

In one of his last pieces, published in Outside, Power had traveled to Costa Rica to investigate the killing of Jairo Mora Sandoval, a 26-year-old conservationist murdered by poachers as he tried to protect leatherback turtles.

The magazine later paid tribute to him, saying: 'Matt approached the story in his usual fashion: he heard the news and jumped on a plane.'

As news of his unexpected death spread, friends and former colleagues tweeted favorite articles Power and written, and expressed sympathy to his wife, Jessica, and family.

Harper's Magazine, where he had begun his writing career, tweeted: 'RIP Matthew Power: a former intern, a contributing editor, and one of our favorite human beings.'

Writer Andy Kroll tweeted: 'Crushed to hear that @matthew_power has died. Loved his work. A talented guy who encouraged us up-and-comers.'

Others remembered Power for his passion and dedication for journalism, and said he had been an inspiration and a mentor to many young journalists.
