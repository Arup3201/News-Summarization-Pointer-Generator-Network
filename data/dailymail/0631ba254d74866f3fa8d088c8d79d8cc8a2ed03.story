A coroner has cleared an expedition company of neglect over its responsibility to protect an Eton schoolboy who was mauled to death by a polar bear.

Horatio Chapple, 17, was on an adventure holiday to the remote Svalbard islands, north of Norway, in August 2011 with the British Schools Exploring Society (BSES) when he was fatally attacked by the ‘aggressive’ animal.

Following a week-long inquest into his death, Ian Singleton, assistant coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon, today cleared the expedition company of any wrongdoing.

Horatio Chapple, 17, was mauled to death by a polar bear on a trip to the Arctic Circle in August 2011. Right, the corpse of the polar bear, which behaved 'unusually and aggressively' because it had severe tooth pain

He told the hearing in Salisbury that although the group were missing items of equipment including parts of the tripwire alert system, BSES had not acted with ‘neglect’.

He said: ‘I do not find that neglect is appropriate to be considered, as failure (by BSES) was not total or complete.’

Mr Chapple, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, was sleeping in his tent when the bear went on the rampage, inflicting fatal injuries to his head and upper body on August 5 2011.

Four others were hurt before the bear was shot dead at the camp site, where the group - known as Chanzin Fire - had been staying.

Also injured during the incident were trip leader Michael 'Spike' Reid, from Plymouth, Devon, Andrew Ruck, from Brighton, Patrick Flinders, from Jersey, and Scott Bennell-Smith, from St Mellion in Cornwall.

In his narrative verdict, Mr Singleton said: ‘On the 5th August 2011, Horatio Chapple was in a tent on a snow bridge near to the Von Post Glacier in Svalbard, Norway, as part of an expedition.

‘A polar bear was able to enter the camp shortly before 7.30am undetected as the tripwire alarm system around the perimeter of the camp had failed to activate due to a supporting post more likely than not being knocked over by the bear which caused the cartridge to move or fall out of the mine without it detonating.

‘Horatio emerged from his tent and was in the act of standing up when the bear reared up and slammed down on him with its paws pushing Horatio to the ground where the bear then mauled his head, face and neck causing the injury which lead to his death.

The camp site where Horatio Chapple was mauled to death. Witness Matthew Burke said: 'The bear reared up and then slammed itself down on to Horatio'

‘At the time of the attack the polar bear
 was 24 years of age, hungry and in pain from bad teeth which more 
likely than not made it more aggressive and unpredictable.’

The inquest heard that the tripwire system provided by BSES worked ‘inconsistently’ and had missing parts meaning it had to be set up in triangle shapes rather than the expected larger rectangles. It also heard how group members had modified the triggering mechanism using paper clips.

The inquest was told that the group members were expected to be kitted out with pen flares to scare off a bear but there were insufficient available and were only distributed with the group leaders.

The hearing was also told that Mr Reid attempted to shoot the bear with the group’s Mauser 98K but his first attempts were unsuccessful because of the safety catch mechanism which ejected the rounds rather than fired them.

Mr Reid was praised for managing to shoot the bear after reloading the rifle after he himself had been attacked and seriously injured.

In his ruling Mr Singleton said that he believed the modifications made to the tripwire had improved the system.

He said: ‘I find it more likely than not the tripwire system was improved following the modifications.

‘I find, having the benefit of hearing from both the leaders and members of the Fire, it’s more likely than not they had been tested successfully.’

He added that a tripwire system was not ‘100% foolproof’ and said he believed the bear had hit one of the posts causing a loss of tension leading to the mines failing to fire.

He said: ‘On balance of probabilities I find that the corner post had been knocked down by the polar bear on entering the camp as the remaining two posts were still upright.’

Mr Singleton said that the use of a tripwire system instead of a bear watch was compliant with Norwegian law.

He also ruled that the distribution of pen flares to the group members could not have helped Mr Chapple as they were not designed for use in close range and would have taken 20 seconds or more to assemble. He also said that they would not have been usable in the circumstances.

Mr Singleton ruled that Mr Chapple had received fatal injuries immediately from his contact with the bear and Mr Reid could not have saved his life even if he had managed to fire the rifle on his first attempt.

He also ruled that the rifle was probably in the safety catch position when Mr Reid first tried to fire it.

The coroner described how a post-mortem examination of the bear found it was and had worn-down teeth which could have led to it being ‘stressed, aggressive and more unpredictable’ than a younger bear.

He said: ‘I find that on balance of predictability that the behaviour of the bear was more aggressive and unpredictable than the majority of younger bears that were encountered in Svalbard.’

Mr Singleton adjourned the hearing 
last Friday after listening to legal submissions, including from Lizanne
 Gumbel QC who was representing the Chapple family.

The Etonian schoolboy was described as 'a fine young gentleman with amazing potential'

Ms Gumbel, in submissions, told the coroner that Mr Chapple’s parents, Olivia and David, wished him to consider the issue of ‘neglect’ in his conclusion.

The couple, as well as Mr Chapple’s grandfather, Field Marshal Sir John Chapple - former Army Chief of the General Staff and president of the BSES - attended all of the week-long inquest.

During the inquest, Ms Gumbel criticised BSES for providing ‘unsafe’ equipment, particularly the tripwire system which she said was designed to protect chickens from foxes, not a campsite from a polar bear.

She said: ‘The fact that this child Horatio was in a campsite which was not protected was down to the society (BSES).

‘The equipment that was sent out was not the suitable type of equipment in the first place.’

In an independent report into the bear attack by High Court judge Sir David Steel, commissioned by BSES, he criticised the society for its reliance on the tripwire system.

He said that a bear watch should be used instead and also called for an overhaul of rifle training.

Sir David concluded: ‘In future a bear watch must become the norm for expeditions to Svalbard. There needs to be complete review of available tripwire systems but they should be treated only as a secondary protection device. There needs to be a rigorous upgrade of rifle training.’

Mr Singleton said that he would not be preparing his own list of recommendations as he believed Sir David's suggestions and BSES' implementation of them was sufficient.

He said: ‘I do not believe it is necessary for me to make such a report on this occasion.’

Lieutenant General Peter Pearson, from Earlswood, Chepstow, Monmouthshire, who is executive director of the BSES, said the organisation had adopted all of the recommendations made by Sir David in his report.

He added that he had accepted that the equipment was unsatisfactory and explained that the BSES was working with a company to build a new system which was being trialled in Greenland.

Mr Pearson said: ‘In principle, we have accepted in the future it will be safer if there is a wire and a bear watch.’

‘This is not a fly-by-night organisation, we tasked a High Court judge to carry out an independent inquiry which was not required, we are absolutely an open book.’
