A businessman has been jailed for faking his own death in India in a bid to pocket a £1.1m life insurance payout.

Sanjay Kumar, 45, claimed to have died of ‘brain fever’ in a desperate bid to clear his family’s mounting debts.

But
 Kumar was actually in Delhi obtaining a fake death certificate and a receipt 
confirming he had been 'cremated', at an imaginary crematorium.

Sanjay Kumar (front) and his wife Anju Kumar (back) appeared at Southwark Crown Court today after being found guilty of a £1.5 million insurance scam

Kumar- born in India but a British citizen with dual nationality - flew to Delhi on business trip on 3 November, 2011.

He later emailed his wife Anju Kumar, 46,  telling her he had fallen seriously ill and had been taken to hospital.

By 26 November, mother-of-three Mrs Kumar received an email, informing her that Sanjay had been killed by a ‘brain fever’ and cremated.

He then tried to claim a £250,000 policy from Scottish Provident and a term assurance policy with Aviva worth £450,000.

There were also claims for a second term assurance policy with Aviva valued at £450,000 and finally a Legal and General assurance pension death claim policy to the value of £5,789.38.

The couple tried to pocket £1,155,789.38 but were only paid £10,615.49 by the time of their arrest.

Southwark Crown Court Aviva heard Scottish Provident became suspicious about the circumstances of Kumar’s ‘death’  and launched an investigation.

Detectives then established that Mrs Kumar had wired £1,522 to her husband via Western Union - two days after the couple claimed he had died.

The City of London Police’s Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department (IFED) later discovered Sanjay was in serious debt.

The failed businessman had been director of nine companies since the 1990s, and complained of ‘threats’ from his creditors.

The couple had also re-mortgaged their home in Watford, Hertfordshire, twice, leaving ‘little or no equity’ in it.

After realising his fraud had largely failed, Kumar returned to the UK under a false name to reunite with his wife, but was quickly arrested.

The couple, now separated, did not look at each other as Sanjay was jailed for 30 months and his wife was handed a suspended prison sentence.

Prosecutor Peter Walsh said: ‘This was a fraud carried out by the two defendants who both faked the death of Mr Sanjay Kumar in order to make false claims on various life insurance and pension policies.

‘They attempted to obtain a total of £1,155,789.38 from Aviva, Scottish Provident and Legal and General.

‘They married in 1991 and they now have three teenage children.

‘Mr Kumar became director of some nine companies from 1992 and she - Mrs Kumar - was registered director of four companies since 1998.’

By 2011, the couple were in ‘serious financial straits’.

Kumar was actually in Delhi obtaining a fake death certificate and a receipt confirming he had been 'cremated', at an imaginary crematorium

‘They had re-mortgaged their home twice due to financial difficulties and by then there was little or no equity in it.’

The couple had suffered a series of county court reverses in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, demanding they pay creditors thousands.

‘Mr Kumar flew to Delhi on 3 November 2011 and he remained there until August 2012.

‘Various fake documents, purporting to be issued by a hospital and crematorium, were obtained, certifying Mr Kumar’s death and these documents were submitted to Aviva and Scottish Provident and the claims were therefore started under these policies.’

The companies grew suspicious and dispatched investigators to india, Mr Walsh said.

He added: ‘Although Mr Kumar had been in hospital, it was only for one day, as a result of a minor illness.

‘He had nothing more serious than diarrhoea and a viral infection, and he was issued simply with a certificate saying he was unable to travel because of the discomfort on the plane.’

When the insurance companies balked, Anju Kumar even ‘instructed lawyers to fight the refusal of the claims’.

Mr Kumar was jailed for two-and-a-half years. He pleaded guilty to six counts of fraud by false representationMrs Kumar received a five month jail term, suspended for two years and a five month tagged curfew

‘Mrs Kumar was arrested on 30 August 2012 and when interviewed, she denied being responsible or having planned any part in the life insurance frauds.’

The court heard how Kumar cynically attempted to blame his wife, writing a letter to his son, 20-year-old Vishal.

‘The father clearly admits there had been fraud, but seeks to blame her for it.’ 

The note said, ‘This news [of the fraud] shocked me and I was extremely angry’.

‘I had no involvement in this false claim for insurance.’

Mr Walsh went on to say ‘a number of typed entries’ on Sanjay’s Blackberry referred to ‘killing himself and getting insurance claims sorted’.

He also wrote of ‘the shock of my life’ when the claims were turned down.

Abi Johnson, defending Mrs Kumar, begged the judge for ‘mercy’ as she had a dependant daughter who suffered from asthma.

‘The prospect of having a criminal record has caused her to suffer.’

Counsel for Sanjay Kumar, Avi Chaudhuri, said the case was ‘a personal tragedy’.

‘It has unquestionably fractured his relationship with his children and no matter how hard they try in the future, that relationship will undoubtedly never be the same again.’

Kumar flew to Delhi (pictured) on 3 November 2011 and he remained there until August 2012. During that time various fake documents, purporting to be issued by a hospital and crematorium, the court heard

Sentencing, Judge David Higgins branded the couple ‘thieves’ and said the fraud was ‘sustained, relatively sophisticated and very serious’.

‘If you stoop to crime in this way, then you must accept the consequences, and the courts have long made clear they are likely to be severe.

‘Your behaviour was quite routinely deplorable and deeply anti-social.

Mr Kumar was jailed for two-and-a-half years. He pleaded guilty to six counts of fraud by false representation, with a potential value of £1,155,789.38.

Mrs Kumar received a five month jail term, suspended for two years and a five month tagged curfew.

She pleaded guilty to two counts of the same offence, in respect of a falsely claimed sum of £10,615.49 only, which the authorities will now try to claw back.

Four more allegations of fraud against Anju were left to lie on file.

DC Tom Hill, who led City of London Police’s Insurance Fraud Department investigation said: ‘Sanjay Kumar’s answer to building up substantial debt was to fake his own death in India and let his wife cash in their investments.

‘Unfortunately for the couple their tale of supposed tragedy quickly fell apart under scrutiny by insurers and IFED, with the uncovering of one lie exposing several more from the Kumars as they attempted get their hands on a massive payout.

‘Now that he is behind bars they will have time to reflect on whether making fraudulent claims is the right way to go when faced with financial troubles.’
