They gave more than 20 boxes of clothes, bags and shoes in an attempt to raise money for victims of Typhoon Haiyan but pieces from David and Victoria Beckham's bumper donation have already ended up in less scrupulous hands.

Just hours after the Red Cross shop selling the Beckhams' donations opened, items from the sale are already listed on eBay.

Among them are a tuxedo that belonged to the former England footballer and a pair of Dolce & Gabbana shoes that were once owned by his wife.

On sale: This pair of Dolce & Gabbana shoes that once belonged to Victoria Beckham are already listed on eBay

Uncharitable: This tuxedo jacket that was once owned by David Beckham has a minimum £300 bid attached

Many of the pieces also have reserve 
prices that far outstrip that charged by the charity shop, with the 
tuxedo offered for a minimum £300 - far higher than the £75 needed to 
buy it.

The original sale, which opened this morning, saw fans queue around the block in a bid to get their hands on items owned by the superstar couple.

Despite the less-than-honourable 
intentions of some shoppers, inside the scene was one of good natured 
chaos as shoppers fought to get their hands on the choicest designer 
goods.

But
those who wanted to get their hands on pieces from Victoria's current 
wardrobe were left disappointed as most of the garments dated from her 
WAG days.

Also included in 
the 
sale were pieces that were worn during her Spice Girls career including a
slashed-front LBD, a tight black T-shirt emblazoned with the 
word 'POSH' and an oatmeal hoodie with 'Spice Girls' picked out in black
across the back.  

Choice: The shoes, in a rainbow of colourful shades, line the shelves of the Kensington Red Cross shop

Performance: These gold boots included in the sale were first worn for a 2000 Spice Girls show at the Astoria

Throng: Shoppers eager to get their hands on a piece of fashion history scramble to the till at the charity shop

Battle of the black dress: Although it caught the shopper on the left's eye, the blonde lady took the piece home

Excited: This Beckham fan appears utterly overjoyed to be allowed into the shop when it opened at 11am

One careful owner: Mrs Beckham's collection of jewelled shoes by Jimmy Choo and others look barely worn

But there were still bargains to be had as many of the pieces, which included designs by Dolce & Gabbana, Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo, started at just £25.

The couple also donated their famous matching Dickensian 
outfits worn at the Venice Film Festival in 2006.

Posting photos of her piles of discarded clothes ahead of the giveaway on her Twitter page, Victoria wrote: 'Proud to support @BritishRedCross #ShopDrop Donating clothes for #Haiyan survivors.'

Victoria, who is said to have spent the weekend sorting 
through her wardrobe, urged others to follow her example and donate 
their old clothes.

Shoppers needed to be sharp elbowed to reach some of the items, as the rush for the best clothing heated up 

She said: ‘Typhoon Haiyan has devastated the 
Philippines, killing thousands and leaving hundreds of thousands 
homeless. The British Red Cross is now carrying out an enormous 
humanitarian relief project to help all those people in desperate need.

‘David
and I are supporting the Red Cross Shop Drop for the Philippines 
campaign and we urge everyone in Britain to do the same.

A 
Red Cross source said: ‘We asked if they would like to help us raise 
money for the Typhoon Haiyan survivors and they jumped at the chance.

Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines on Friday November 8th, and has left more than four million people homeless.
