Serena Williams was inspired by older sister Venus' progression to the fourth round of the Australian Open as she fought back from a set down against Elina Svitolina.

Williams, who had to save three set points in the opening set against Vera Zvonareva in the previous round, fell behind this time to her Ukrainian opponent before going up through the gears to win 4-6 6-2 6-0.

And the 33-year-old then revealed she had been inspired by seeing the score from her sister's match displayed on television screens inside Rod Laver Arena.

'I was a little upset coming out here because she was down a set and a break and I was destroyed,' Williams said. 'Then I looked up and she was 4-1 up so I thought, "Serena you can do it too". We always motivate each other.'

Williams meets world No 24 Garbine Muguruza in the next round, who beat her at the French Open last year. Muguruza defeated Timea Bacsinszky 6-3, 4-6, 6-0.

Svitolina made an excellent start but could not keep up her good form and faded down the stretch
