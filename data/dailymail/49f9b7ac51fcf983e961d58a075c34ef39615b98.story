In addition to the human remains uncovered along an Alaska trail near the home of a family of four who vanished a year ago, police revealed Monday that a handgun and a dog were uncovered at the site as well.

Police in the town of Kenai, population 7,100, say the dog's description matches that of the missing family's springer spaniel. They also say the recovered gun likely came from their home less than two miles from the shallow mass grave.

Brandon Jividen, 38, his girlfriend Rebecca Adams, 23, her two children Michelle, 6, and three-year-old Jarraca and their dog Sparks had not been seen for 10 months, prompting massive police searches with help from the FBI.

Police said they believe the gun came from the family home based on a serial number match.

Found: Rebecca Adams, 23, her two children Michelle, 6, and three-year-old Jarraca and their dog Sparks had not been seen for 10 months. Their bodies were discovered along with the family dog's in a pit a few miles from their Alaska home

So who did it? Along with the family and the dog, police found a handgun registered to the family. They said there was no indication they were moved to the mass grave where they were found and that no outside party was suspected in the slayings

Kenai police Lt. Dave Ross said Monday the bodies haven't been identified by a coroner, but police have every indication it's the missing family. 

'The clothes, the remains, the handgun all appear to match the missing family,' Ross told KTUU.

Ross provided few other details, saying the investigation remains open, however he hinted that the gruesome fates met by the family members may have been at the hand of one of their own.

He said there's no reason to believe another person was involved in the deaths or that the bodies were moved.

'We don't have any reason to believe from what we've collected that they were transported there,' Ross said. 

Died at the site? Responding officers found remains and items reported missing from the home of Brandon Jividen, 38, and girlfriend Rebecca Adams, 23. Adams two daughters were found as well. Police say their is no indication the family was moved to the pit where they were found

The grim discovery came after a person driving down a west Kenai trail on Saturday spotted items, which were reported missing from Miss Adams and Mr Jividen's home.

FBI officials are travelling to the area to help with the investigation. 

Police added that it would take time to positively identify the remains and to complete the investigation. 

The family, along with their pet dog, were last seen on May 27 last year with relatives saying it appeared that they had left their home without packing.

Their two vehicles remained parked outside their apartment and their rent for June had not been paid.

The family were reported missing on June 5, after a neighbor contacted police to report that the family home appeared to have been lying empty.

Miss Adams sister, Lanell Adams said that the young mother had been 'very distressed' during a phone call in the week before she went missing.

Miss Adams who travelled to Alaska from Washington State to look for her sister, said: 'She sounded very distressed. She just told me: 'Know that I love you' and that she had to get off the phone very quickly.

Investigators begin to comb the woods close to where the remains were found. On Saturday, a person driving down a west Kenai trail spotted clothing and what appeared to be human remains

The family's disappearance last May prompted massive searches led by Kenai police with help from the FBI

'Growing up we always had this thing, we say 'Thou shall not lie'' and you always have to tell the truth.

'I asked her, ''Thou shall not lie, Becca, are you ok?'' She said, ''Don't ask me that right now. Just know that I love you.''

Meanwhile her uncle Dennis Giffords told the Alaska Dispatch News: 'You have a shred of hope that they will be found. And that shred has been taken away.'

Kenai is a city of 7,100 about 65 miles southwest of Anchorage at the mouth of the Kenai River, Alaska's most popular sport fishing attraction. 

Also missing were Adams' children, Michelle Hundley, 6, and Jaracca Hundley, 3
