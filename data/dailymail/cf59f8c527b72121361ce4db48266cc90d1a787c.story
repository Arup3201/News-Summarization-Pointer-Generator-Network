The Vatican has recognised a supposed miracle attributed to Paul VI and will beatify the late Italian pope in October, which would leave him one step from sainthood, a Vatican source said today.

Paul VI reigned between 1963 and 1978 and presided over key reforms from the Second Vatican Council.

During his reign, he also survived an assassination attempt at Manila airport in 1970 by a Bolivian surrealist painter.

The Italian news agency ANSA reported that the apparent miracle identified by the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints was the healing of an unborn baby from an otherwise incurable illness.

ANSA said the beatification could occur on October 19.

Two late popes, John Paul II and John XXIII, were given full sainthood in a Vatican ceremony last month.

Catholic Church procedures require one miracle attributed for beatification, which confers the status of 'blessed' on the person in question, and two miracles for canonisation to join the ranks of saints.

Paul VI was praised for his efforts to seek closer ties with other Christian denominations but his 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae was controversial for spelling out a ban on all forms of artificial contraception.

The application for beatification was begun in 1993.

The Vatican's detailed process for 
making a saint usually starts in the diocese where the candidate lived 
or died.

A postulator — essentially the cheerleader spearheading the 
project — gathers testimony and documentation to build the case and 
presents the report to the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of 
Saints.

If the congregation's experts agree the candidate lived a 
virtuous life, the case is forwarded to the pope who signs a decree 
attesting to the candidate's 'heroic virtues.'

Over
 time, the postulator may come across information that someone was 
miraculously healed by praying to the candidate.

If, upon further 
investigation, the cure cannot be medically explained, the case is 
presented to the congregation as the possible miracle needed for 
beatification.

Panels of doctors, theologians, bishops and cardinals 
must certify that the cure was instantaneous, complete and lasting — and
 was due to the intercession of the sainthood candidate.

If convinced, 
the congregation sends the case to the pope who signs a decree saying 
the candidate can be beatified. A second miracle is needed for 
canonization.

Beatification 
allows for veneration of the candidate locally, say in a particular 
diocese or country. Canonization allows for veneration throughout the 
universal church.

Martyrs, 
or people who were killed for their faith, get a free pass and can be 
beatified without a miracle. A miracle is needed, however, for martyrs 
to be canonized.
