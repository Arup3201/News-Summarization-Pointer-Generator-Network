Labour will build 200,000 homes a year by 2020, Ed Miliband will pledge today as he sets out plans for a new generation of garden cities and new towns.

The Labour leader will tell his party's annual conference in Brighton that a shortage of housing is central to Britain's 'cost of living crisis', leaving millions of working people unable to afford the houses they want.

And he will also promise to cancel a planned Coalition cut in corporation tax for 80,000 big companies to fund lower business rates for small firms.

The Labour leader will today attempt 
to steal the Tory mantle as the party of ‘vibrant, dynamic’ small 
enterprise, which he says will drive the recovery.

He
will echo Ronald Reagan’s 1980 attack on Jimmy Carter, saying voters 
should ask themselves at the 2015 election: ‘Am I better off than I was 
five years ago?’

Yesterday,
he staged a one-man walkout as union boss Len McCluskey warned Labour 
had ‘no future’ unless it bowed to the unions’ demands.

He stalked off the conference stage as the Unite leader rose to declare Labour was now ‘our party’.

Mr
McCluskey, who received a standing ovation, quipped at the Labour 
leader’s departing back: ‘I am sorry that Ed has left the platform but, 
anyway, thank you.’

But despite the public spat, he later told a fringe meeting that unions were getting a ‘warmer reception’ from Mr Miliband than they had from New Labour. 

Mr Miliband will use his conference speech today to outline proposals to loosen the planning system to allow dozens of new towns to be built, expand state-funded childcare and crack down on rip-off energy firms.

However, it is his decision to hit bigger companies that employ millions of people to fund a tax break for small firms that will prove most controversial – and almost certainly infuriate business groups.

He will pledge to reverse a planned cut in corporation tax from 21p to 20p if he wins power in 2015.

That will cost the 80,000 largest firms £340million in the first year and £785million in the next.

Labour would use the money to cut business rates on properties with an annual rental value of £50,000 or less, so that in 2015 they return to the level of 2014. Labour would then freeze the rates until 2016.

The move would benefit the owners of 1.5million shops, pubs and other small businesses by an average of nearly £450 over two years.

Mr Miliband will say the move demonstrates Labour’s commitment to creating a ‘One Nation economy’ and to becoming ‘the party of small business’.

He will say that while the economy appears to have turned a corner, living standards are still getting worse.

Many new jobs are ‘too low paid’, he will say, while gains in the economy are ‘scooped up by a privileged few’.

Mr Miliband, who this week declared he was bringing socialism back, will wage class warfare, telling activists: ‘They used to say, “A rising tide lifts all boats”. Now the rising tide seems to lift the yachts.

‘At the general election in 2015, you should ask yourself, “Am I better off now than I was five years ago?” You’ve made the sacrifices. But you’ve not got the rewards.

‘Will the pain be worth it for the gain under this government? No.’ 

He will insist that the Prime Minister’s talk of Britain being in a ‘global race’ means a ‘race to the bottom’ with ‘the lowest wages, the worst terms and conditions and the fewest rights at work’.

Mr Miliband will set out plans for a Rebuilding Britain Commission, led by former BBC Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons, which will work with councils to identify sites for new towns.

It will prepare a legislative framework for Labour to start building immediately if it wins the 2015 general election.

Mr Miliband will accuse David Cameron of presiding over the lowest level of home-building of any prime minister since the 1920s, resulting in a situation where fewer than half of the homes needed to keep up with demand are being built.

With just 87,000 homes built this year, Britain is facing the biggest housing crisis in a generation, he will say.

An average family needs 22 years to save for a typical deposit on a home, compared with three years in 1997, Mr Miliband will say.

By the end of the next Parliament in 2020, numbers of houses built should be increased to at least 200,000 a year, he will tell activists in his keynote conference speech.

The Lyons Commission will be told to develop a detailed plan so that Labour can hit the ground running on entering office - including the drafting of new legislation and detailed plans for new towns in specific locations.

Any attack on a member of the armed forces will be a specific criminal offence with a tougher penalty, under Labour plans announced yesterday.

Jim Murphy, the party’s defence spokesman, outlined a new Armed Forces Covenant to give the forces priority for health services and housing, support with finding a job, and protection from discrimination.

He said Labour will table amendments to the Defence Reform Bill in the coming weeks to bring in a specific criminal offence for attacking forces personnel ‘ensuring they are treated with the dignity their bravery deserves’. 

Mr Murphy told the Labour party conference in Brighton: ‘It’s sad that those who fight for our country might need the protection of our laws, but some do.’

He said the Government had neglected soldiers’ housing, and scrapped specialists and equipment, jeopardising safety on the front line.

In a jibe at International Development Secretary Justine Greening he said: ‘This is a government that during the crucial Syria vote two of their own ministers locked themselves away in a soundproof room. It’s little wonder this government won’t listen.’ 

Miss Greening and Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds claimed they missed the vote because they were chatting in a soundproofed room.

Mr Murphy said despite the Labour vote against the principle of military intervention in Syria they had to remain ‘prepared to intervene’ in other cases.
