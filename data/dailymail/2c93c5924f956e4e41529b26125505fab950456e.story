Vice President Joe Biden has hit out at New York's LaGuardia Airport, comparing it to 'some third-world country.'

Biden strongly suggested the airport could use some major improvements Thursday, as he compared it to Hong Kong's equivalent.

Hong Kong's solitary airport is known for offering travelers a seamless, stress-free experience.

However, Biden said if he blindfolded someone and took him to LaGuardia Airport he'd think he was in 'some third-world country.'

He said Hong Kong's airport was light-years ahead and has the type of modern facility travelers would expect to see in the United States.

His remarks came during an event in Philadelphia in which he stressed the need for infrastructure improvement.

Biden focused mainly on Amtrak, which just unveiled its new Cities Sprinter electric locomotive.

But he said the nation's ports and airports also need to be upgraded.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey operates LaGuardia. It hasn't responded to a request for comment.

The airport is located in the northern part of the New York City borough of Queens.

The airport is on the waterfront of Flushing Bay and Bowery Bay, in East Elmhurst and borders the neighborhoods of East Elmhurst, Astoria, and Jackson Heights.

In 2012, about 25.7 million passengers used the airport, which first opened for commercial business in 1939.

Biden isn't the first to take aim at the outdated airport. LaGuardia has been ranked in numerous customer surveys as the worst in the U.S.
