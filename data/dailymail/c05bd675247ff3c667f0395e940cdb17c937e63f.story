Two brave teenage pilots managed to land a plane that lost power mid-air without causing a single scratch on the plane or on their bodies.

18-year-old certified pilot Eric Nicholas and his pilot-in-training friend Tanner Price of Tulsa, Oklahoma, took off in a Cessina 172 from Riverside Airport and were doing a touch and go at Tulsa International Airport with the next stop being Owasso airport, reports Oklahoma's Own.

Pilot Eric Nichols told reporters that the plane barely made it past the runway when the plane's speed indicator showing how fast it is going plummeted to zero.

Brave: Hero teenage pilot Eric Nichols has only 61 hours of pilot training but he managed to make a perfect emergency landing when a plane ran out of power

Perfect landing: The plane landed just feet in front of a moving car

Proud friend: Tanner price is happy to be alive after watching his friend make the perfect emergency landing

Instead of panicking, the brave boys used their training to make the perfect emergency landing.

'It's amazing. I've never seen something like this before. Never been in it,' Price said.

After their first day back at Jenks High School they flew the plane to Tulsa International and even touched the ground once.

When they went to go back into the air they only made it 100 feet because the engine lost power.

'We had about 1,900 RPMs and I knew that wasn't going to be enough to get us anywhere, so we didn't have enough runway, I told tower, 'I'm putting it down,' and I set it down on the road here,' said Nichols.

Nichols knew that landing would be risky because a car was driving down the road below them. Luckily it slowed to avoid the falling plane.

Nichols masterfully set the plane between two utility poles and says he knew how because he's made narrow landing before.

'Uh, it was a tight fit. Definitely a tight fit,' Nichols said.

Tulsa Fire Airport Chief, Michael Atchison, said he was impressed with the boysâ€™ quick thinking in a life-threatening situation.

'Real proud of those guys,' Atchison said.

'They did a good job 'cause, you know, the tense moments right there, for them to lay it down, find a place to land it when they lost all the power. They did a great job.'

Nichols only has 61 hours of training while Tanner has just 13. The company that owns the plane called Christensen Aviation confirmed that no one was injured.

Oklahoma's Own pilot Will Cavanaugh said he was also impressed with the teens' flying chops.

'Very tight landing. For such young pilots to have this experience so young, and to walk away from this, only good things for them in the future,'Kavanagh said.
