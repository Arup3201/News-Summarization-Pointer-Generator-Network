Invasive foreign animals and plants such as oak processionary moths, Japanese knotweed and killer shrimp are a spiralling problem that the Government is failing to deal with, a panel of MPs has found.

Ten new alien species are arriving in Britain each year and many cause catastrophic problems, according to Parliament’s green watchdog.

The Environmental Audit Committee today publishes a report on the problem, which is costing the economy hundreds of millions of pounds a year.

The worst foreign intruders that are causing 'catastrophic' problems for he Government to deal with

Some 1,875 non-native species were counted in the UK in 2012, of which 282 had become ‘invasive’, the report found.

Newcomers including North American signal crayfish, killer shrimp and zebra mussels are having a huge impact on native species, as well as human health and business, the MPs said.

Joan Walley, the committee’s chairman, said there are more non-native species than ever before.

She said: ‘Not all of these species will become “invasive”, but the ones that do can harm native wildlife, clog up our waterways, cause costly problems for homeowners and sometimes even harm human health.

'It is too expensive to control or eradicate all invasive species, so we have to be smart and pick fights we know we can win.

We may just have to live with grey squirrels and rhododendrons in much of the UK, but we can and must control other invasive species – like the killer shrimp devastating eco-systems in rivers and lakes.’

The committee is calling for a change in the law that would give the Government new powers to eradicate invasive species before they become established.

The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits releasing non-native species to the wild, but no one has been prosecuted under the law.

The MPs believe that ministers should follow the example set by Scotland’s Government, which has passed laws allowing environment officers to enter any land where they suspect invasive species are creating a problem.

Some non-native animals have caused profound change, such as the replacement of red squirrels by grey squirrels in most of Britain.

Grey squirrels do £10million of damage to trees a year, the report found, while it costs £165million a year to battle Japanese knotweed.

The European Environment Agency estimates invasive species cost EU countries £10billion a year, while it cost £11million to clear just one national park in Wales of invasive rhododendron.

Some species also affect health. Giant hogweed has given anglers skin inflammations, while common ragweed pollen causes asthma. The Asian hornet, yet to enter Britain, has killed six people in France.

Austin Brady, of the Woodland Trust, said: ‘Continued targeted management of invasive species such as rhododendron and grey squirrels must be supported at government level.’

The invaders can damage ancient woods and carry disease, he said.

‘To leave them unchecked in the long term would be a real failure to safeguard our natural heritage.’
