Another asylum seeker alleged an Australian guard said he wanted to have sex with children on the island and forced two under age refugees to perform sexual acts in front on him.

An asylum seeker who chose not to be identified has alleged that guards on Nauru detention centre (above) have threatened refugees with rape , offered illicit substances in exchange for sex with under-age detainees, and made them expose themselves in order to have showers over two minutes long

The allegations come as ongoing protests are being staged in Nauru over the decision to offer people on Christmas Island temporary protection and work rights in Australia, but not the those being held in Nauru.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison proposed the plan last week, which would allow the reintroduction of temporary protection visas and remove all asylum seekers from Christmas Island.

The protests are also responding to the the decision to send Australian refugees to Cambodia, where there is also violent protests being staged outside the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh, with activists demanding the refugee deal is abandoned.

A spokesperson for the the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection told Daily Mail: 'Senator Hanson Young's allegations have been referred to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.' 

A spokesman for the Refugee Action Collective with Ian Rintoul said these are not the first sexual assault allegations from Nauru.

'We are looking into this most recent claim, but it's not an isolated incident. There has been a series of similar complaints over the last few months. 

'We usually only get word of it when the detainees have to come to Australia for emergency medical treatment.'

Senator Hanson-Young has written to Immigration Minister Scott Morrison, asking for an independent investigation into the shocking allegations and calling on him to 'act immediately.'

Mr Rintoul said a contingent of security has flown in from Brisbane to counter the protests. There have been almost thirty instances of self-harm from Nauru asylum seekers, with five of these being young refugees who have stitched their lips together in protest

'The proposed plan to eventually release some people from Chrsitmas Island has created a higher sense of despair on Nauru. The detainees on this island were arbitrarily selected-many came on the same boats.'

Mr Rintoul said the protests on Nauru have been under way since last Thursday, and there extra security is being flown in from Australia.

'There has just been a batch of extra security flown in from Brisbane to counter the protests. As of yet, there have been almost thirty instances of self-harm from asylum seekers on Nauru. Five of these are young refugees who have stitched their lips together in protest.'
