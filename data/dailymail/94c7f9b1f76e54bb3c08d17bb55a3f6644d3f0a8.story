A mother who allegedly suffocated her 11-month-old boy told police ‘I reached my breaking point, I didn't want him anymore’.

Afterwards, she then appears to have posted a macabre photograph of her boy’s corpse on her Facebook page, with the message ‘R.I.P Tinkabutt’.

Nicole ‘Nikki’ Kelly, 22, from Queens, New York, has been charged with the second degree murder of Kiam Felix, Jr, who was pronounced dead at Elmhurst Hospital on Sunday after being taken there by Kelly and the father, who lives separately.

Police said that Kelly, a former Home Health Aide, killed Kiam by wrapping him in a bed sheet, leaving him unable to breathe, according to Pix11.com.

Queens DA Richard Brown said that she callously left him alone for half an hour to die.

A neighbor said that when the boy’s father, Kiam Felix Sr, who is not suspected of being involved in the death, arrived at the house there was a great deal of shouting.

The unnamed resident told The New York Post: ‘I could hear him yelling, “I’m not waiting for the f****** ambulance, he’s not breathing!”’

If Kelly’s unnamed housemate is to be believed, the disturbing nature of the story doesn’t end with the allegations of murder.

The housemate, who Kelly rented a room from, told Pix11.com that Kiam was dressed in a white-collared shirt, tie and pants, when he was taken to hospital – and a picture of him dressed like this appeared the next day on Kelly’s Facebook page.

There is widespread speculation, therefore, that she had posted a picture of Kiam’s lifeless body.

Along with the photograph carrying the ‘R.I.P’ headline, Kelly left a message that read: ‘Missing my baby boy so much wish there was some way I could bring him back to life. I feel horrible knowing he passed away Am his Mother I was supposed to protect him I know his spirit will always be around me.’
