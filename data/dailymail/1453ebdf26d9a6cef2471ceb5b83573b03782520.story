An Alaskan teenager has been accused of using an assault rifle to shoot dead two state troopers as they tried to arrest his father in a remote village.

Nathanial Lee Kangas was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and a count of third-degree assault when he appeared in court on Saturday.

The 19-year-old allegedly shot Trooper Gabriel Gabe Rich and Sergeant Patrick Scott Johnson in the back as they struggled to detain his father, Arvin, in the remote village of Tanana on Thursday.

As bail was set at $2 million, the judge 
asked Kangas if he had anything to say. After a long pause, the teenager
 replied: 'I'm sorry.'

Every seat in the courtroom was full, and the walls were lined with law enforcement 
officers of several agencies as Kangas faced his charges.

Officers 
hugged and consoled each other at the hearing.

Kangas' mother, Judy, and younger brother, Albert, each gave brief apologies.

'I
 want to tell everybody, the families, from the bottom of my heart that I
 am sorry,' Mrs Kangas said as she choked back tears.

The troopers, both fathers, were part of a four-man team that patrolled the remote regions of Alaska.

On
 the day of their deaths, Rich and Johnson had been following up a 
report that public safety official Mark Haglin had been threatened with a
 gun.

The pair had traveled to Tanana, which is accessible only by boat or plane, to arrest Nathaniel's father, Arvin Kangas.

The 58-year-old was due to face charges of driving without a 
license and threatening Haglin, an unarmed official.

Haglin had 
received reports that the elder Kangas was driving around the village, 
even though he doesn't have a valid driver's license.

After Haglin 
approached his home, the elder Kangas pointed to a rifle
 and suggested he would use it if Haglin did not leave, according to the
 charging document.

Haglin 
then contacted state troopers, who obtained an arrest warrant and 
accompanied him to the home a day after the confrontation.

Arvin
 Kangas refused to cooperate with the troopers after being informed of 
his arrest warrant and tried to run inside his home, according to the 
charging document.

The troopers pursued, and a scuffle ensued, according
 to the document.

That's 
when Nathanial Kangas allegedly appeared with an assault rifle and shot them. He then pointed the weapon at 
Haglin, but lowered it and Haglin was able to flee, according to court documents.

Haglin
 called for help, and with the aid of other community members, was able 
to detain the teenager Kangas until more troopers arrived.

Kangas 'spontaneously stated that he was sorry for doing "it"Â 
and that he shot troopers because the troopers were wrestling with 
Arvin,' the documents stated.

His father was also arrested and is being held in Fairbanks.

'These
 are serious crimes, killing two Alaska State Troopers, two of my Alaska
 State Troopers ... I would support the recommendations of the district 
attorney and hope that you put the maximum amount of bail possible,' Colonel James Cockrell said during Saturday's hearing.

Processions were held for Rich and Johnson on Saturday. Their bodies were taken from Anchorage to Fairbanks.

The deaths highlighted the dangers the force faces as it patrols remote and difficult terrain.

'This will take us a long time to heal,' Colonel Cockrell said on Friday.

'Currently
 department members are dealing with shock and disbelief trying to make 
sense of Sergeant Johnson and Trooper Rich's deaths,' Cockrell told KTUU.

Like
 many troopers assigned to patrol multiple villages, Rich and Johnson 
worked from a rural service base about 130 miles from Tanana, which they
 reached by plane.

The men and their rugged patrol route had featured on a National Geographic reality show, Alaska State Troopers.

Tanana resident Ruby Cruger is related to the Kangas family, but said she did not know the details of the shooting, just that it has affected the entire community.

'They're all shocked,' Cruger said of the town's reaction to the shooting.

National Geographic said in a statement that it was 'incredibly saddened' to learn of the deaths.

Spokesman Chris Albert said the troopers are among the many who are subjected to the daily challenges of working in isolated areas of the state, such as Tanana.

Johnson was born in Fairbanks and grew up in the Alaska community of Tok. He was a veteran trooper who joined the force in 1993.

He spent his career in Fairbanks and worked a variety of roles, including patrol trooper, field training officer and as a canine officer, instructor and canine unit supervisor.

The husband and father of three daughters also had worked as a supervisor of a Fairbanks-area narcotics team.

Rich was born in Sayre, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Fairbanks. He first worked as a patrolman with the North Pole Police Department southeast of Fairbanks before deciding to join the troopers in 2011.

With the troopers, he spent most of his career on patrol. Survivors include his fiance, their one-year-old son and his fiance's eight-year-old son.

At the time of his death, Rich was in the process of adopting the older boy, troopers said.

Johnson and Rich joined the interior rural unit on January 1. The unit covers 23 villages scattered across a sparse terrain.

Their deaths came the same day the name of Manokotak village public safety Officer Thomas Madole was added to the Indian Country Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Artesia, New Mexico.

Madole was shot and killed March 19, 2013, while responding to a domestic violence call in the Alaska Native village.

Before Thursday, 64 law enforcement officers had been killed in the line of duty since 1897 in Alaska, according to information previously provided by the Alaska State Troopers.

Police memorials in Fairbanks, Anchorage and Juneau are being planned to pay tribute to the slain troopers.

Gov. Sean Parnell said in a statement that he and his wife, Sandy, 'were deeply saddened to learn of the senseless, brutal crime that took the lives of two of Alaska's finest.

'These fallen heroes answered the call to serve and protect, and made the ultimate sacrifice, while keeping our communities safe.'
