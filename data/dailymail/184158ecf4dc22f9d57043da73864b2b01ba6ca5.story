Britain’s ageing population is more to
blame for the nation’s housing crisis than the influx of immigrants, 
the government has claimed.

Tory minister Nick Boles said the rise
of great-grandparents meant more homes were needed to accommodate more 
generations of families who do not want to live together.

He said that two thirds of growth in population was ‘not from immigration but from ageing’.

Pressure: Britain's ageing population is responsible for the bulk of housing demand because different generations of families do not want to live together, the government claimed

The planning minister's claim came as 
Tory MPs staged a revolt against plans to build thousands  of homes on 
the Green Belt, saying  it would lead to ‘planning anarchy’ and lose 
them votes at the next election.

Angry backbenchers criticised Planning
Minister Nick Boles for forcing a major building programme on councils 
to meet a chronic housing shortage.

But he said they had to respond to a 
housing crisis caused by an ageing population and uncontrolled 
immigration under the last Labour government.

Mr Boles conceded that one source of population growth was immigration ‘which was uncontrolled for a long time’.

Warning: Planning Minister Nick Boles said the population has grown, and Britain has not built enough houses to keep pace

He went on: ‘We as a party rightly criticised that, and are now doing something to control it.

‘However, it is important to remember 
that the majority—about two thirds—of the growth in population and in 
the number of households in the country has resulted not from 
immigration but from ageing.

‘One way that I ask people to think 
about it is by considering how many people now are part of families in 
which four generations are alive.

‘Quite a lot of them are. It used to 
be rare to have a great-grandparent or great-grandchild in a family; it 
is now common, because people are living longer, and they do not all 
want to live in the same house.’

Last year, Mr Boles told councils to find the land to build 270,000 homes by 2018.

He has claimed an area of greenfield land the size of London must be built on to solve the crisis.

Yesterday he told MPs it was better to
build on former industrial land, but this could only be used for 70 per
cent of the homes needed, adding: ‘Our population has grown, and we 
have not built enough houses to keep pace.

He was backed by Tory MP Damian Hinds 
who said that ‘not all, or even nearly all’ of increased demand for 
homes is about immigration.

‘If we strip out future net migration,
the projected requirement is still 149,000: people are living longer; 
households are smaller, for all sorts of wider social reasons; kids live
away at university and have a place at home; hardly anyone has a lodger
anymore; and so on,’ Mr Hinds said.

‘There are lots of pressures, and they will not go away.’

Meanwhile backbenchers said ministers had promised that they could decide where to build homes and draw up local plans.

But they claimed developers were 
being allowed to ride roughshod over the wishes of local planners and 
foist housing developments on unsuitable areas.

Under threat: Mr Boles has claimed an area of greenfield land the size of London must be built on to solve the crisis

Former planning minister Sir Tony 
Baldry said four developments proposed in his Banbury constituency were 
refused by the council, only to be given the green light by Local 
Government Secretary Eric Pickles.

Sir Tony said the decisions ‘rode a 
coach and horses though protection for the Green Belt’, adding: ‘This is
not a sensible planning policy, this is planning anarchy.’

Laurence Robertson, MP for 
Tewkesbury, said there was no shortage of homes in his constituency, but
developers planned to build 50 per cent more within 20 years.

He added: ‘I question the 
Government’s assertion that they must built so very many houses that 
local authorities have to designate green-belt land to meet these 
arbitrary and as yet undefined housing targets. Our policies on planning
are losing us many votes.’

Former Home Office minister Nick 
Herbert insisted that despite government rhetoric about empowering 
councils, home-building was ‘developer-led and effectively amounts to a 
free-for-all on our countryside’.
