A Connecticut family had all but lost hope Wednesday they'd be together for the holidays after a pre-dawn fire swept though their duplex home leaving four unaccounted for.

The front of the two-family building on the Connecticut River was left burned out with a partially collapsed roof and charred interior walls. 

Neighbors called 911 just after 6am after hearing an explosion. A friend of the survivors told the Hartford Courant the fire may have been started by a Christmas tree.

Tragic: Family friend Jessica Rozalski (at left as she stood in front of the home's remains) told reporters Wednesday the names of the presumed dead in a pre-dawn Connecticut blaze

Sad: Among the dead according to Rozalski was Cathy Armes (pictured). Rozalski says the blaze may have been started by a Christmas tree

Matriarch: Rozalski said another apparent victim was Orise Handfield (pictured)

Jessica Rozalski told the Courant that two of the survivors from the right side of the 100-year-old house were her friend Laurie Johnson and her son Richie Handfield. 

Handfield was airlifted to a hospital for treatment for burns to his lungs.

Missing from the right side of the house, Rozalski told the Courant, were Johnson's son Josh Johnson; Laurie Johnson's mother, Orise Handfield; Orise Handfield's daughter, Cathy Armes; and another male victim named David.

'It's sad. It really is,' Rozalski said as she stood on the street outside the home with a friend. 'I've known them my whole life and now it's possible they won't be here no more. I don't know what to think.' 

Firefighters responded to the fire at about 6:15 a.m. Wednesday in Enfield, about 20 miles northeast of Hartford. 

Josh Johnson, grandson of Orise Handfield, was also presumed dead. Not pictured is a fourth apparent victim, another grandson of Orise Handfield's

Explosion: A fire truck sits at the scene of a fire  Wednesday morning in Enfield, Connecticut that authorities were alerted to at 6:15am when a neighbor called to report having heard an explosion

Intense: Firefighters work at the scene Wednesday morning after getting the fire contained. Authorities had to wait to enter the building after it partially collapsed under the intense heat

Fire department spokesman Mark Zarcaro says the four missing people range in age from 40 to their late 60s. 

A woman and her two sons, who are about 19 and 12 years old, lived on the south side and escaped to safety, said the woman's sister, Lisa Lape.

Lape said she saw a story about the fire on TV and Facebook and rushed to the scene from her home in Bristol. She ran up to firefighters and told them her sister, Mary Lapane, lived there.

Lape said her sister was in the shower when she smelled smoke and was able to escape with her family.

'She's in shock,' Lape said of her sister. 'She's OK. We're going to get through this.'

Zarcaro says part of the second floor collapsed into the first floor, and firefighters have been trying to stabilize the building before entering.

Startling video from the scene shows flames raging at the top of the home. Footage shot later shows a plume of smoke streaming from a window near the roof.

'The flames were raging throughout the building and we had more than 20 firefighters battling the fire from four or five of our fire companies,' said firefighter Sean Clifford, of the Hazardville fire station. 'This was one of the worst I've seen here.'  

It was on the second side where the fire burned most intensely. It was also from that side that four remained unaccounted for.

Smoke continued to our from the home as late as 9:30am

The missing people all lived on the side of the house where the blaze was the fiercest
