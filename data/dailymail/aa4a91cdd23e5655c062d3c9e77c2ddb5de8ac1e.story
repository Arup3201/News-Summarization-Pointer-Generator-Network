He's back: Former Co-op Bank boss Paul Flowers has moved back into his grace-and-favour vicarage

There was rising anger last night after it emerged disgraced former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers has moved back into his grace-and-favour manse.

The 63-year-old Methodist minister, whose lifestyle sent shockwaves through both the church and the bank, was spotted back at the £300,000 house owned by the church last week.

The cleric, who allegedly took cocaine and crystal meth and paid out hundreds of pounds for sex with rent boys, is understood to be living rent-free in the four-bedroom house in Bradford, with the blessing of Methodist church leaders. 

Yesterday the revelation caused fury among both residents and parishioners.

Pauline Edwards, 61, a Methodist churchgoer, said: ‘I can’t really believe he’s been allowed back in. It’s an outrage really. He should have the decency to quit and not show his face again.

‘He hasn’t denied the allegations he used drugs and went with rent boys so he should go.’ 

A spokesman for Families Against Crime, which works with drug addicts, said: ‘Many people working in the sex trade are addicted to drugs and do so to fund their addictions.

‘It is totally wrong that a church minister accused of funding the drug addictions of male prostitutes is living in a church house.

‘He is taking advantage of their vulnerability for his own purposes. It’s a disgrace.’

Another former parishioner said he was disillusioned with the church leadership over the scandal. 

He said: ‘I know they’re waiting until the conclusion of the police investigation but I don’t think he should be paid or live in the manse while he is under investigation. It sends out the wrong message.

‘I’m totally disillusioned with the way it has been handled and there are quite a few worshippers who have stopped going to church or go elsewhere in south Bradford.’ 

Yesterday it was revealed that Flowers, who faces investigations by both the police and City regulators, has not lost his appetite for an unorthodox lifestyle.

Crystal meth shame: How The Mail On Sunday broke the original story in November last year

Although he promised to seek professional help, he is allegedly still using the horse tranquiliser drug ketamine and consorting with male prostitutes.

Last Wednesday, he asked a rent boy to visit and promised in a taped telephone call: ‘I will have K [ketamine] but that’s all. You get what you want.’ 

According to an investigation by The Mail on Sunday, the £400-a-night escort, who is 40 years his junior, told Flowers he wanted to bring a friend along.

The minister replied: ‘How much have I 
got to pay for that, for God’s sake? I don’t want the escort to be off 
his trolley like before.’

Informed the cost would be the ‘same as last time’, Flowers admitted he couldn’t remember what he paid before.

The fresh revelations will pour yet more scandal on the Co-op Bank, which has been lambasted over its choice of chairman. 

Action: In November, Chancellor George Osborne announced an independent inquiry into the whole Co-op Bank affair

It came close to collapse after running up £700million in losses and being forced to fill a £1.5billion black hole in its funding.

As bank chairman and deputy chairman of the Co-operative Group, Flowers oversaw the bank’s activities throughout the lead-up to the crisis.

Last week the financial industry’s two main watchdogs – the Prudential Regulatory Authority, an arm of the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority – announced they would hold separate investigations into whether there was any failure or wrongdoing at Co-op Bank.

Flowers is expected to be called to testify.

In November, Chancellor George Osborne announced an independent inquiry into the whole Co-op Bank affair, but that will have to wait until the two City watchdogs have completed their investigations, which are set to take several months.

Flowers’ lifestyle was exposed last November when he was filmed allegedly handing over £300 for the Class A drug, crystal meth, and the latest revelations are set to disappoint his Methodist church employers.

A spokesman for the church said: ‘He is still an office holder in the church and we will investigate thoroughly once any criminal processes have finished.’

Flowers, a minister for 40 years, is due to be reinterviewed by detectives this week over the drug allegations.
