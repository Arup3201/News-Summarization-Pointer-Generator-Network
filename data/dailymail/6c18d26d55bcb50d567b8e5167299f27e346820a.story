Uh-oh! These mischievous brothers certainly have some explaining to do after getting covered head-to-toe in paint. 

Ryder and Sawyer DiMario from San Diego, California, were caught red-handed by their father Cris following a dalliance with some art supplies.

A home video shows the youngsters sheepishly hiding in the shower, struggling to explain their purple and green glow.

'Whose idea was this?' Mr DiMario asks.

The boys glance at each other, neither one wanting to take the blame.

'Did you think this was a good idea? Who got the paint out?' their father continues.

Ryder, aged three, points at Sawyer, two, and blurts out that his younger sibling got the paints by 'building stairs with wooden blocks.'

Sawyer is seen covering his face with his hands as his cover is blown. However, Mr DiMario points the finger back at Ryan: 'How come you didn't tell him "no"? Who's the big brother?'

Ryder hangs his head in admission that he should have stopped the painting session.

Smile: To date the clip of the art attack incident has been watched more than 800,000 times

When he and his brother are asked if they deserve to be punished they look at each other and shake their heads.

Mr DiMario is then heard breaking into laughter as the boys' adorable faces prove too funny. 

He tries to resume a stern manner, insisting that the siblings are in 'big trouble' but his voice continues to waver. At the end of the clip he says that a clean-up operation will be taking place.

The boys' mother, Alecia, said the art attack incident occurred two years ago. To date the clip has been watched more than 800,000 times.

Mrs DiMario concluded in an email to BuzzFeed: 'I’m glad people see the humor in this and that so many were able to reminisce and relate.

'[It's] just a great reminder not to take ourselves or our children too seriously.'
