Tony Blair will launch a staunch defence of the European Union today, amid growing speculation he is planning a fresh bid to become president of Europe.

The former Prime Minister will use a speech to the CBI in London to underline his pro-EU credentials, and make the case for Britain’s deeper involvement in Europe.

The intervention comes just days after he held private talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel about how to tackle the growing tide of Euroscepticism across Europe.

Mr Blair is said to have offered to tour Europe and the world persuading people that ‘being in the EU is good for you’, despite the dismal economic performance of the Eurozone.

His offer was seen as a fresh drive to win a top job in Europe.

In 2009, Mr Blair lost out to the little known former Belgian prime minister Herman van Rompuy in the race to become the first President of the European Council – the group of EU leaders that has the final say on key decisions.

His bid was reportedly blocked by Mrs Merkel, who believed his Iraq War legacy was too toxic, and feared that he would use the role as a platform to outshine the EU leaders he was supposed to represent.

His meeting with Mrs Merkel last week was widely seen as an attempt to clear the way for a second bid for the top job later this year when Mr van Rompuy steps down.

Mr Blair’s office issued a denial at the weekend, saying: ‘Tony Blair is not seeking any role, has not discussed any role and doesn’t want any role.’

But despite the denial, some Brussels observers believe he is looking to make a return to European politics – possibly in a specially-created role.

One Eurosceptic Labour source said Mr Blair sees himself as ‘Europe’s antidote to Nigel Farage’.
