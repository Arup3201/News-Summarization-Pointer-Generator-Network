The woman on the left? Alison Moyet. The woman on the right? Also Alison Moyet.

Once a size 22, the singer is now a svelte size ten – and almost unrecognisable.

But while many dieters would be deeply envious of her weight loss, Miss Moyet herself thinks she has gone too far.

Alison has dropped from a size 22 (left) to a tiny size 10 (right) over the last four years, but says she is now actively trying to re gain weight as she feels she has lost too much

The 51-year-old said: ‘Personally I 
think women look better with a bit of chub on them. I’ve lost too much 
weight and I’m working on getting fatter again.’

Usually reluctant to discuss her size for fear of betraying the 
‘sisterhood’, in a new interview she opened up about her concentrated 
attempt to lose weight four years ago.

‘It was a mixture of health 
reasons and not wanting to be looked after by the patronising thin,’ she
said.

She added: ‘It’s funny as my whole character has been based upon not 
getting approval elsewhere. And I don’t like the kind of approval that 
goes with weight loss.

‘Still, in my 50s where my next significant event is being a 
grandmother, I have to worry about my scraggy a***.’ Miss Moyet first 
found fame in the 1980s as one half of the electropop duo Yazoo.

She went on to launch a successful solo career, selling more than 25million records.

When Alison performed When I Was Your Girl, the first single from her 8th solo album on This Morning on the 8th May 2013 (right), she was half the woman she was when she was an eighties pop icon (left)

But success came with its own set of problems. The singer has previously
spoken about how she grew up feeling ugly and isolated, often suffering
cruel slights for her appearance.

She once said: ‘By the time I was a 
teenager I was so absolutely convinced of my Elephant Man distortedness 
that I went all out to be as physically unattractive as I could as an 
act of defiance.’

These issues were exacerbated by fame. For almost a decade, Miss Moyet 
was a virtual prisoner in her own home, crippled by depression and 
agoraphobia.

At the same time her weight ballooned. Miss Moyet, now a 
mother of three, said her children saved her.

She explained: ‘Becoming 
famous is a really shocking thing, especially when you don’t have 
aspirations to it.

When she was in Yazoo, Alison's larger frame was as much an integral part of her public image as her shaggy hair and deep soulful voice

Alison's new album 'The Minutes' is her eighth in a amazing career that has seen her sell over 25 million records

‘It got to the point where I would try and avoid making eye contact with anyone. It was freaky and it just happened overnight.

‘In a lot of respects having kids has saved me from myself. If you’ve 
got a child and the child wants to get up, then you have to get up.

‘There is also something to be said of being tired of just having a particular pathology. I just got tired of being depressed.’

Last month Miss Moyet, who is married to teaching assistant David 
Ballard, sang at the wedding of her best friend, Dawn French. In the 
interview, with the Mirror, she described how she sympathised with the 
‘loving and generous’ comedian because of the attention she attracted 
with her own battles with weight.

Miss Moyet’s latest album, The Minutes, went into the charts at number five on its release earlier this month.
