Jailed: Joseph Collier, 72, from Dulwich, has been sentenced to 15 months in prison after being found guilty of taking in stolen metal from cemeteries

A scrap metal dealer who bought hundreds of bronze memorial plaques that were stolen from cemeteries has been jailed for 15 months.

Joseph Collier, 72, was found guilty last month of taking the stolen metal and cutting it up in to unidentifiable pieces that he sold on.

Some of the plaques were still screwed to the stakes used to plant them at cemeteries across south London including Croydon, Teddington, Putney Vale and Beckenham. 

And footage shown to the jury during Collier's six-day trial at Croydon Crown Court showed some of the pieces were still caked with fresh mud and grass.

Today he was told that the worth of the plaques 'can't be valued in monetary terms' and that their theft 'would have caused distress' to the loved ones of the deceased. 

Police raided Collier's DSM Scrap Metal Yard in Croydon in May 2012 as part of a London-wide crackdown on metal theft. 

During the raid, they found boxes and bags containing more than 723 memorial plaques, as well as a stolen bronze dragon and a £1,800 statue of Jesus that was stolen from a grave in Putney Vale.

Many of the plaques had been cut up into small pieces in an attempt to disguise them.

In order to identify where the plaques had been stolen from, officers from Croydon spent several hours piecing them back together.

They were later able to identify 250 names on the plaques, which included those placed as recently as 2012. 

Collier, from Dulwich, south London was arrested and charged with offences the following day and was bailed pending his court appearance.

But 10 months later, suspicious that Collier was continuing to receive stolen goods, police set up an undercover operation where an officer offered him reels of copper worth £800 - making it clear that they were stolen. 

Collier was found guilty of three counts of possession of criminal property, one count of disguising criminal property and one count of attempting to receive stolen goods last month. 

His lawyer, James Martin, told Isleworth Crown Court today: 'He fully appreciates the seriousness of the offending and the suffering to the families of loved ones.

'He said when he read it in the newspaper he felt like a grave robber.

'He was running a legitimate business, but in a way that was asking no questions. He's taken people on face value and not asked the proper and appropriate questions.'

Collier claims the scrap value of the plaques was only £4,000, but the police say the cost to replace them to bereaved families would be £17,000 to £30,000.

He fought the case and even tried to dodge responsibility when interviewed by the probation service after his conviction. 

Mr Martin said: 'He was explaining just because they were plaques didn't mean they were stolen.'

'He's lost his business now, that's a huge blow to him. He's a man who's literally worked every day of his life. 

'There's no chance anyone is going to give him a scrap licence again and he doesn't know what to do with himself.' 

The first cemetery targeted by thieves was Croydon in September, 2011. Over 200 were later stolen from Beckenham, 148 from Tonbridge & Malling, 300 from West Norwood and nine from Putney Vale.
