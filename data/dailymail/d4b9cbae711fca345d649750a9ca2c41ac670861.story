A police officer was spotted turning heads on a Sunshine Coast beach for his choice of transport.

Contrasting greatly with the bikini-clad beach-goers, Senior Constable Pierre Senekal was seen in a full length uniform, topped off with a helmet, as he rode a Segway across the sand of Noosa beach in Queensland.

Senior sergeant Steven Mcreight told Daily Mail Australia that the two-wheeled electric vehicle was often used to patrol beaches and boardwalks in the area.

'It's a quick way to move around and research from other law enforcement agency's show they are relatively quick and have a beneficial height factor of about 15-30 cm that allows better vision,' Mr Mcreight said.

'It's a new technology for new police and the guy enjoys using it and finds it quite convenient.'

Mr Senekal said the Segway attracted people's attention whenever he used it, particularly that of tourists.

He also told Daily Mail Australia of his own enthusiasm for the device, which he said he rides 'a hundred times a day'.

'It's good fun on the beach, especially when it's busy and you can't really drive or walk - the Segway is pretty good to get around and get between people,' Mr Senekal said.

While most sun-bathers waved back at the policeman as he passed by, many more couldn't help but stare admiringly at the officers wheels

'Tourists love it and lots of people want to take photos, especially as it has police signage and flashing lights.'

The Noosa Heads officer said his Segway could drive 18km/h, the pace of a fast jogger, and that although he was yet to chase anyone with it he had been called to jobs with it that had resulted in arrests. 

Queensland police undertook a trial of the new technology in early 2014 on the Sunshine Coast, Gold Coast and Southbank. 

The trial, which concluded in June, saw 75 officers trained to use the devices and found that they were an ideal alternative way of transport in areas that are normally only accessible by foot.

Segways are already used by police around the world including in China, Paris and New York.
