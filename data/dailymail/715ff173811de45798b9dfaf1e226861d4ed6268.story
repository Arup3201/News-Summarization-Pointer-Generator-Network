Lorraine Kelly has unveiled her first-ever clothing range with JD Williams that she says she has designed for 'fifty plus women who are in their prime and want to look fashionable'

Speaking about her new range, which she models herself, Lorraine told MailOnline: 'Designing a fashion collection has always been a dream, and I am delighted to have achieved that with JD Williams. 

'I have been involved every step along the way and seeing the final outcome has been incredibly exciting. The best part will be seeing women - like me - dressed in products from my line in the New Year, and fingers crossed feeling fabulous inside and out.'

The 55-year-old Glaswegian cites herself as the inspiration behind the collection - even naming one of the pieces after herself.

The TV presenter often chats women's fashion and style on air and now she has channeled her styling expertise into designing her own fashion range

Lorraine has been the face of the brand for a year and now she's designed her own collection of dresses, jeans and chic coats

'It was really about what I want to wear as well as a lot of feedback from viewers over the years. I wanted classy but comfortable clothes that look stylish and are also flattering,' she said.

Lorraine, who served as the face of JD Williams before designing the range for the brand, believes that there's a big untapped market of 50-plus women who are 'in their prime and want to look fashionable'.

She said: 'Women of 50-plus look better than ever and as a 55-year-old, I know that I want to look chic and on trend but also have the comfort factor.'

One of Lorraine's favourite pieces is this jumpsuit, which she says was designed to either be worn around the house or with heels and a belt for a night on the town

The colourful range is available in sizes 10 to 32, with prices ranging from £29 for an embellished top to £75 for a Geo Print Jacquard Red Coat

Lorraine spent hours in the design studio curating chic Burberry-esque raincoats and Issa-esque wrap dresses, as well as a jumpsuit that you could 'wear around the house' or team with 'sassy high heels  on a night out'. 

Speaking about her personal sense of style, she said: 'My own style is pretty minimalist to be honest. I like clean lines, no fuss and a good cut.'

'My style icon would be Helen Mirren; she isn't afraid to experiment. I loved her floor length D&G dress teamed with a black leather biker jacket on the red carpet. She looks comfortable in her own skin. She wears the clothes - it is never the other way around.

'I think Julianne Moore always looks effortlessly elegant. I also admire Meryl Streep and I think Ruth Langsford from Loose Women never puts a foot wrong,' she added. 

The 55-year-old Glaswegian cites herself as the inspiration behind the collection and each of the pieces are items she would want to see in her own wardrobe

Lorraine for JD Williams is available at www.jdwilliams.co.uk from  in sizes 10 to 32, with prices ranging from £29 for an embellished top to £75 for a Geo Print Jacquard Red Coat.
