After gay marriage gained big Election-night wins in Maine, Maryland and Washington State, it seemed Americans were slowly accepting the idea of same-sex marriage.

But to ensure that support becomes nationwide, the men of College Humor put out a video for undecided voters who may want to keep marriage between men and women: Gay Men Will Marry Your Girlfriends.

In response to the warning, straight men over atÂ Scotch Tape Productions came up with their own video rebuttal, saying: 'We'd just like to say: "Oh my god, please do that!" That would be f**king awesome.'

The straight guys challenge, tongue n' cheek: 'Go ahead, marry our girlfriends. Because we're not going to.'

Their rebuttal counters the sarcastically hyperbolic, male homosexual stereotype that is portrayed in the original College Humor video, posted last week. It stated: 'We would be the best husbands ever, have you seen us?! We are ripped. All of us are ripped. It doesn't seem statistically possible, but it's true.

'We love going to the gym, and you know who else loves going to the gym? You're girlfriend. We'll go to the gym with her, and afterwards we'll get Pinkberry as a reward.'

It continues, showing the gay men gardening, in the kitchen, at the gym and standing in front of pianao: 'Not to mention, we dress better than you. While you were spilling "mandwich" on your cargo shorts, we were inspecting our Oxford shirts for the craftsmanship of their gauntlet buttons.

'And don't even get us started on dates. You don't wanna go dancing? We teach a dance class. You're not on the list for that art gallery opening? We'll BBM the owner... And yes we would like to go to that Eighties-themed costume party. And no we weren't just checking out the other girl.'

Scotch Tape Productions, in the end endorsing same-sex marriage, responded using their own exaggerated heterosexual stereotypes to make a point.

'We want you guys to be able to marry each other, we're pulling for ya, we really are. But in the meantime, feel free to marry our girlfriends. Just know.. that we warned you,' they say.

'We're allowed to get married, and we still don't want to. All that nagging, just for doing the things we want to do? If we thought marrying our girlfriends was going to be awesome, we'd do it ourselves. Trust us, this will make you glad you're a homosexual.'

College Humour tackled the sex question 
by saying: 'We already know how she likes to be kissed. You know all 
those sweet spots, preferences and fantasies she's too embarrassed to 
tell you, or thinks you should innately know, yea she's told us. We 
could play her like an upright bass.'

Scotch Tape Productions retaliated: 'Let's be honest, you're not going to go through with it. You find vaginas to be icky, and we think they're awesome. But just because we know how to make girls swoon over us, doesn't mean we want to do it every day for the rest of our lives.'

The straight men, who are filmed in bar, in front of a barbeque, and also at the gym, add: 'And what did we cook our girlfriends for breakfast? Nothing, we were having sex until lunch time.

'But all the stuff we never wanted to do with our girlfriends, you've got that covered?' they ask.

'Who do we make these thank you notes out to?
