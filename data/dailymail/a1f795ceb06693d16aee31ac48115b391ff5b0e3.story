A northeastern Pennsylvania city official says a blog photo showing a woman poised to lick the badge of a moonlighting cop outside a bar probably isn't a crime, but may violate department regulation.

The chief of the Wilkes-Barre Police Department is investigating that photo and two others showing provocatively dressed women posing on the hood and the trunk of a police car.

The officer in the badge-licking photo, who appears to be off-duty and moonlighting as a bouncer at a bar, now faces possible punishment from the department.

Wilkes-Barre spokesman Drew McLaughlin said in a statement to the Citizens Voice newspaper: 'Upon initial review, judging by the type of uniform worn by the officer and the lack of a wireless antenna for the RMS system on the vehicle, we believe it to be at minimum a year old.'

McLaughlin said no officers are pictured
in the police cruiser photos, but that the photo of the woman poised to
lick the officer's badge could violate regulations if the officer were 
actively participating in having the photo made.

McLaughlin added: 'Upon determining the full facts of the case, appropriate disciplinary action will be administered by the chief.'

The photos were featured on local blog Wake Up Wilkes-Barre.

Wilkes-Barre officers are allowed to moonlight to provide security at bars through a program run by the police union.

The Citizens Voice reported that The Hardware Bar, which has since been renamed the Susquehanna Ale House, often employ off-duty cops for crowd control on busy nights.

During those shifts, the officers wear their police uniforms and drive in their cruisers.

Wilkes-Barre Police Benevolent Association president Tom Kupetz told the Citizens Voice that the moonlighting officers give 10 per cent of their earnings to Wilkes-Barre for use of city-owned equipment and insurance.

Based on evidence in the photo, police believe the badge-licking occurred more than a year ago.
