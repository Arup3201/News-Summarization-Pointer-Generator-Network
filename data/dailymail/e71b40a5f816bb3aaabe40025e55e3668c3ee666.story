Jury selection has begun today in the corruption trial of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife in Richmond.

Bob and Maureen McDonnell have pleaded not guilty to charges in a 14-count indictment with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from the CEO of a dietary supplements company in exchange for helping promote his products.

Their trial in federal court began at 10am on Monday and is expected to last at least five weeks.

The McDonnells arrived separately at the courthouse this morning, the former governor flanked by his attorney Henry W. Asbill. His wife walked into court hand-in-hand with their daughters Rachel McDonnell and Cailin Young.

Amid a media scrum, the couple hugged each other in the courthouse hallway and greeted those who had turned out to support them.

NBC reporter Julie Carey tweeted that when the ex-governor arrived at the courthouse he made a joke to her, asking: 'Is something going on here?'

Before the trial’s opening, federal prosecutors filed a list of 61 potential witnesses, including Maureen McDonnell and the couple’s three children, Sean, Rachel and Bobby.

During jury selection, Judge James R. Spencer read a list of possible defense witnesses, including Bob McDonnell, former Virginia Governor L. Douglas Wilder, former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, and Virginia House Speaker William J. Howell.

Maureen McDonnell’s manicurist may even be called to give evidence, according to The Washington Post.

This morning, jurors were asked to fill out a questionnaire and were asked if they knew either of the defendants or witnesses involved in the trial. 

One potential juror revealed to the judge that he had attended political events with the disgraced governor, according to NBC, but was allowed to remain when he said that this would not cloud his judgement.

McDonnell was a rising national star in the Republican party and was considered a possible Mitt Romney running mate in 2012 before the federal investigation ruined his political future.

Before being indicted 10 days after leaving office in January, McDonnell apologized for what he described as bad judgment and said he repaid about $120,000 in gifts and loans, but he denied breaking any laws.

He and his lawyers have argued that prosecutors are trying to criminalize routine and long-accepted political courtesies, like hosting receptions and arranging meetings, that fall short of more tangible rewards historically associated with bribery.

Prosecutors have countered that the McDonnells' willingness to help former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams on 'an as-needed basis' and Williams' expectation of something in return, whether he received it or not, is enough to support a conviction. If the jury agrees, the McDonnells could face decades in prison.

Williams is expected to testify under immunity as the prosecution's star witness.

According to the indictment, Williams 
lavished the McDonnells with designer clothes, golf outings, vacations 
and large loans while seeking government help promoting his company's 
products and securing grants for research studies.

No government grants were awarded, but the indictment says the 
McDonnells hosted or appeared at numerous events to further the 
company's interests.
