We're now well into Movember, the November-long occasion when men grow a moustache for the 30 days of the month to spark conversation and raise funds for men's health.

But as if men needed another reason to put down the razor, more than half of British women think men with bushy 'hipster' beards are 'sexiest'. 

A quick hashtag search of #BILF (which stands for Beard I'd Like to Fondle) brings up more than 16,000 results on Instagram. The trend is clearly not going anywhere.

Despite a recent survey revealing a beard can make men look up to ten years older, more than half (51 per cent) of women prefer the bushy beard look on a man over clean shaven, a bit of stubble, or any other styles.

The distinctive look - a full, heavy beard that falls beneath the jawline and is often accompanied by a thick moustache - is particularly popular with trendy twenty-something hipsters and male models.

Celebrity sporters of the stylish face-fuzz include Hollywood hunk Tom Hardy, Gossip Girl actor Penn Badgley and lothario Calum Best. 

Nearly all of the women surveyed (82 per cent) agreed that bearded men looked more masculine, with over two thirds revealing they would prefer to date a man with a beard over one who was clean-shaven.

Some women  determined to bag a bearded bloke admitted they had asked - or would ask - their other half to grow a beard if he was clean-shaven, according to the new poll.

A further 38 per cent  added that it would be somewhat of a turn-off if a man was unable to grow a beard, saying it would 'make them appear juvenile'.

Despite male grooming still being a sensitive subject for some men, the vast majority (84 per cent) of women said they found men who take pride in their grooming and appearance more attractive than those who don't - as long as they didn't take it too far like the men from The Only Way Is Essex or Geordie Shore.

Most women (82 per cent) agreed it would be a massive turn off for them if a potential partner displayed poor grooming skills.

The new poll found surveyed 1,000 women on their preferred men's facial fuzz, in light of Movember. 

A spokesperson for online beauty retailer Escentual.com, which conducted the survey, said: 'At the moment we are seeing a huge craze for beards that are fuller, but exceptionally neat and well kept. The smart, masculine look has been a top trend for men in 2014 and it doesn't look to be going anywhere soon.'

'We've seen a massive 92 per cent year on year increase in sales of traditional barber shop style grooming products like the Acqua di Parma Collezion Barbiere range, as more and more men have been embracing the trendy bearded look.' 

The popular social media accounts for the BILF movement have a sense of humour

It's meme after meme featuring beards of all shapes and sizes (generally the bigger the better; not always)

The BILF UK Facebook page - for those who 'have a beard, admire beards or are beard-curious - has 7,000 likes, and the @b_i_l_f Instagram account more than 4,000 followers.

'Team BILF is made up of a team of people with a huge fondness for beards,' says BILF UK owner Vicky Scarfield, from Brighton.

After she started the Facebook page, she found BILF turned into a huge community over night, 'which is when the idea to make T shirts and sell them for charity evolved'. 

'Eventually BILF is looking at starting an apparel company, hoping to launch properly next year focussing on fundraising and selling good quality street wear.

'We are working with Decembearduk at the moment doing a raffle; if all the tickets sell we hope to raise £2,000 with the money going to bowel cancer. At the end of the year we are going to make a donation to other cancer charities with the money made through our T shirt and hat sales. We decided to support cancer charities initially because all the core team members (Tim Allen, Lea Turner) of BILF have all lost people close to them to the disease.

'We all work for free with the aim to raise as much money for charity as possible.

'Team BILF collectively run and admin all the social media sites with help of spreading the word through friends and colleagues. BILF as a hashtag did exist but we amended it to "fondling" because anyone and everyone can get invloved with our kind of BILFing. People now hashtag #BILFs and #BILFettes too.'

Movember sees men grow moustaches for the annual campaign for men's health - and the official rules say no beards or goatees.

The reasons for the poor state of men's health, as stated on the Movember website, are numerous and complex.

They include a lack of awareness and understanding of the health issues men face, men not openly discussing their health and how they're feeling and reluctance to take action when men don't feel physical or mentally well.

Men are also likely to engage in risky activities that threaten their health, and the stigmas surrounding mental health can prove a problem for them.

The Movember Foundation aims to change this way of thinking by putting a fun twist on this serious issue.

Using the moustache as a catalyst, the idea is to bring about change and give men the opportunity and confidence to learn and talk about their health and take action when needed.

As a global men's health movement, the Movember Foundation has the ambition to contribute to improving the lives of men around the world. This will be achieved through programs we fund in the areas of - Awareness & Education, Living with Cancer, Research and Mental Health.

Its aim is to reduce mortality from prostate, testicular cancer and men's suicide, and to help men living with prostate or testicular cancer to have the treatment and care needed to be physically and mentally well. 

It wants to educate men and boys how to be mentally healthy and take action when they experience mental health problems, and ensure men and boys with mental health problems are not being discriminated against.

The United Kingdom Movember campaign raised £20.4 million in 2013, of which 88.3 per cent went to programmes supporting prostate cancer and testicular cancer initiatives. 

The rest supported admin and fundraising costs. 

Men and women can sign up to do a run or walk for charity, for example, to support the Movember Foundation.
