Grammy winner Kelly Clarkson has hit out at music legend Clive Davis for 'spreading false information' about her in his new tell-all memoir.

The 30-year-old star wrote a damming open letter today after the record executive claimed that she broke into 'hysterical sobbing' when he demanded that her smash hit 'Since U Been Gone' be included on her album, Breakaway.

Kelly - whose stellar career was guided by Davis after she won American Idol - lashed out, saying: 'I refuse to be bullied and I just have to clear up his memory lapses and misinformation for myself and for my fans. It feels like a violation. Growing up is awesome because you learn you don't have to cower to anyone - even Clive Davis.'

Happier times: Record legend Clive Davis with his protege Kelly Clarkson in 2004. Today, she accused him of 'bullying' her.

In what is turning into a war of 
words between the pair the 80-year-old took to Twitter to defend his 
book, writing: 'I am truly very sorry that she has decided to take issue
 with what I know to be an accurate depiction of our time together.'

Clive said. “Before the book was 
published, I had every fact checked with five independent individuals 
who were present on a daily basis throughout it all.'

In his book, The Soundtrack of my Life, the 80-year-old music executive - who discovered Whitney Houston - tells how he fell out with Kelly over her desire to help pen her own songs on her third album, My December.

However, Davis recalled that he didn't believe the material contained a number one hit and told the singer's manager he was 'out of his mind' to believe otherwise.

He also wrote about a meeting with Kelly in in which he told her that My December was “a pop album that still needs pop hits'.

But in a lengthy statement posted on Whosay, Kelly wrote: 'So I just heard Clive Davis is releasing a memoir and spreading false information about me and my music. 

'First, he says I burst into "hysterical sobbing" in his office when he demanded Since You Been Gone be on my album. Not true at all. His stories and songs are mixed up.'

She said they rowed after Kelly insisted that she wanted more guitars added to the original demo track - and Davis did not, saying she eventually prevailed, adding: 'I couldn't be more proud of the life of that song. I resent him dampening that song in any way.

'But, yes, I did cry in his office once. I cried after I played him a song I had written about my life called "Because Of You."

'I cried because he hated it and told me verbatim that I was a "s****y writer who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon me.'

'He continued on about how the song didn't rhyme and how I should just shut up and sing. This was devastating coming from a man who I, as a young girl, considered a musical hero and was so honored to work with.

'But I continued to fight for the song and the label relented. And it became a worldwide hit. He didn't include that in the book.'

Clive replied on Twitter: 'The chapter [Kelly's] as it is written was thoroughly verified by each and every one of them. I stand by the chapter as written in my book. At the same time I wish, and will always wish, Kelly‘s talent and her career to soar to ever new heights.

Kelly revealed that she was hurt by his accusations about her album My December and its lack of 'pop hits'- and the claims that it didn't chart to well because she co-wrote it.

She also accused Davis, currently the Chief Creative Officer of Sony Music Entertainment, of actively trying to 'sabotage' the album.

She said  'Well, first let me say, I've co-penned many of my "pop hits." Secondly, My December went platinum (It sold 20,000 less than All I Ever Wanted which followed My December.) Hardly a huge failure.

'Never Again, the ONLY single they released in the US from that record was a Top 10 hit.

'I am very proud of that and I have my fans to thank. But, again, what's most interesting about his story is what he leaves out: He doesn't mention how he stood up in front of his company at a convention and belittled me and my music and completely sabotaged the entire project.

'It never had a chance to reach it's full potential. My December was an album I needed to make for myself for many reasons and the fact that I was so completely disregarded and disrespected was so disheartening, there really aren't words to explain….'

Kelly, who is signed to RCA records, won her third Grammy award earlier this month for Best Pop Vocal Album for her fifth studio album, Stronger.

And the star, who is engaged to music manager Brandon Blackstock, finished her message by writing: 'Anyway, I love my job. I love my music. I love my fans. I love my label and all of my professional relationships… now. And I am grateful for Clive for teaching me to know the difference.

'Cheers to another amazing year.'
