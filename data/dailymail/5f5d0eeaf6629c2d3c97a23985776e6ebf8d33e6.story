It's not as far-fetched as it might sound, emergency services could soon be flying to the scene of an accident, in a jet pack.

New Zealand company Martin Aircraft and its futuristic jet pack program is expected to be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange within months and could be selling their flying machines commercially soon.

CEO Peter Coker admits 'it certainly is very exciting, this is going to change aviation forever'.

'It certainly is very exciting, this is going to change aviation forever' claims Martin Jetpack CEO Peter Coker

It's been said that emergency authorities and military officials from around the world have already begun making enquiries with Martin Jetpack

Unmanned (remote controlled) versions are also being built by Martin Jetpack, 'we have had general enquiries from all over the world, both from investment perspective and buyers'

'To a degree, we are breaking new ground with our jet packs,' he said.

They are building the flying equipment for both personal and professional use, with military use also on the agenda.

However, it's in the area of disaster recovery, where Martin Jetpack is particularly determined to make an impact.

Already, they say, that there has been strong interest in the US, across Asia and the Middle East.

While the public listing is likely in Australia, most domestic emergency services told Daily Mail Australia that they remain non-committal when they assessing the invention against current operational requirements. However, one did leave the door slightly ajar, conceding that they are always looking to take advantage of new technology.

The Martin Jetpack runs on twin ducted fans, not a jet engine, like previous incarnations

The jetpack is predominantly carbon fibre and weighs 180 kilograms

The jetpack can reach speeds of 74km per hour and rise to an altitude of 250 metres inside a minute

'The first target is the area of first responder, such as fire-fighting, police, ambulance, any emergency service really.'

After the hoped-for success in that area of business, Martin Jetpack say they will then re-focus on the leisure market. And that may, one day, even include flying to work.

While Mr Coker wouldn't be tied down to a delivery date on the ASX listing, he did say that 'we are now going through the various stages of due diligence' 

The company continues its development program, pending approval of both fiscal regulators and aviation safety authorities.

The price tag of a Martin jetpack will range in price from $150,000 to $250,000, depending on whether it is the (primary) manned version or unmanned.

Martin's first focus will be on the professional market before providing more for personal use

The predominantly carbon fibre pack does not use a jet engine; it has twin-ducted fans to generate lift, runs on 2-stroke fuel, just like your lawnmower or small motorbike

'We are making them a lot cheaper to run and we can get into a lot smaller spaces,' Mr Coker added.

The predominantly carbon fibre pack does not use a jet engine; it has twin-ducted fans to generate lift, runs on 2-stroke fuel (just like a lawnmower or small bike) has a range of about 30 kilometres (or about 20 minutes of flight) before needing to be refuelled and can reach speeds of more than 70 kilometres per hour and fly at a height of about 250 metres.

Plans are afoot to adapt future models allow for different types of fuel.

'We will continue to grow the capability,' Mr Coker said.

 

According to Martin Jetpack officials, they are working with technology which 'is only bound by our imagination'

He made it clear this was a serious business and not 'a novelty' as has been witnessed at major sporting events or shows, in the past.

'Glenn Martin (the company founder) has been thinking about and working at developing a practical jet pack to build form for more than 30 years,' the CEO said.

'It was very much something that grabbed him during his childhood, he always thought they'd be a part of our lives in the future.

'Others which have been used in the past were based on a jet belt, this (technology) is only bound by our imagination.

'We have had general enquiries from all over the world, both from an investment perspective and buyers.'

Jet packs could soon play a part in military operations 

So popular has Martin Jetpack's plan proved that they exceeded and had to close off the pre Initial Public Offering (IPO), designed to cover ongoing costs as it continues to push towards commercialisation of the product. 

Sydney based Corporate Advisory Firm, Axstra Capita, managed the capital raising.

'We are very happy to be able to close the pre-IPO ahead of schedule', Managing Director Reuben Buchanan said.

'This result gives us a strong indication of the positive investor interest in Australia.

'We can now focus our attention on the next step which includes a possible IPO and listing of the company.'
