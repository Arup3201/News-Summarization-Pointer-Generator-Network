A mother has warned against the dangers of internet dating after being beaten up by a man weeks after meeting him online.

Susan Hulbert, 31, signed up to popular website plentyoffish.com last December and was wooed by Gavin Taylor, a high-flying salesman who claimed to be a former policeman.

But he went from perfect ‘gentleman’ to brutal thug when he launched a violent attack on Miss Hulbert, breaking her cheekbone, after she questioned why he was still using the dating website.

Susan Hulbert thought Gavin Taylor was her prince charming when she met him online, until he let his mask slip and she met his violent side when he smashed her face against a wall and fractured her cheekbone

Taylor, 34, has been sentenced to a 
two-year community order and given a restraining order banning him from 
contacting Miss Hulbert or entering Chelmsley Wood, near Birmingham, 
where she lives.

He was also ordered to pay her just £125 compensation.

Now Miss Hulbert, who said he ‘should
 have gone to prison’, has warned other women about Taylor and the 
perils of internet dating.

The mother-of-two, who works at 
Birmingham Airport, said: ‘Gavin was so clever. He treated me like a 
princess, I thought I knew him and it turns out I never really knew him.

'You don’t know who you’re meeting, they could be anybody. I’ll never use a dating site again.’

Miss Hulbert was contacted by Taylor, from Telford, soon after joining the free website and said he ‘seemed quite normal’.

After texting every day, the pair eventually met on a Sunday afternoon in February in a Solihull pub.

Miss Hulbert said: ‘When we met he seemed nice. We didn’t kiss on the first date and I thought he was a gentleman for that.’

The couple started seeing each other but Miss Hulbert began to suspect that the salesman wasn’t the prince charming he appeared.

‘He would get really angry with 
things, the police especially, but never with me,’ she said. ‘He plays 
bowls and I went to watch him play a match and I was getting scared with
 how angry he was getting.’

The mask finally slipped on April 21 while Miss Hulbert was staying at Taylor’s home.

She quizzed him on why he was still 
receiving messages from the dating website and texts from an unknown 
person – and he exploded in rage.

‘He hit my head against the wall, and I slipped down and started crying,’ Miss Hulbert said. ‘He started punching me in my face.

I had bruises all over my hands and 
face from where I tried to protect myself.’

She ran outside but was 
grabbed again by Taylor who began dragging her back to the house. A neighbour heard her screams and called the police.

Miss Hulbert says she will never use a dating website again, but is worried that Gavin Taylor will simply join another and do the same thing to other women

Miss Hulbert was taken to hospital with a fractured cheekbone, large bumps to the head and bruising across her face and body.

Today, although the physical injuries are beginning to heal, the mental scars are as strong as ever.

‘If I close my eyes, I can see it all
 happening but it’s like it’s happening to someone else,’ she said. ‘I 
haven’t really slept ever since.

Before I met him I was known as being almost annoyingly happy.  I don’t feel very happy at the moment. I just feel scared.’

After Taylor avoided a jail sentence 
at Telford magistrates’ court last week on a charge of assault by 
beating, which he admitted, Miss Hulbert said: ‘He will just go on 
another dating agency and do the same thing again.

'But the next one 
might not get away. He is a danger to women.’

She added: ‘Is there any way to stay 
safe on these sites? I don’t think so.

'I waited a long time before 
meeting him, it was a public place. The only thing I can say is follow 
your gut instinct.’

No one from plentyoffish.com was available for comment last night.
