A new KFC store will open its doors in Sydney on Tuesday, however customers are sure to find it a little different to their usual fast food experience.

Boasting a specialised menu and a whole host of new ingredients, the spealised eatery - located on Church Street in Parramatta in the western suburbs - is the first of its kind in Australia.

Burgers, wraps and bowls filled with red quinoa, jalapeno sauces, basmati rice and corn salsa are just some of the new options hungry customers can snap up at the restaurant. 

KFC will open a brand new concept store on Tuesday in Sydney's western suburbs

Located on Church Street, Paramatta, the restaurant will feature a custom menu with new items on it

Red quinoa, jalapeno sauces, basmati rice and corn salsa are just some of the new ingredients available

Fitted with wood highlighting, new imagery and a fresh design the store has also applied for a permit to serve a small selection of beer and cider to its diners.

The application for a liquor license is currently under review at the Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing. 

If approved customers will be able to purchase one alcoholic drink per meal, but there is no move to introduce alcohol into any existing stores.

Nikki Lawson, Chief Marketing and Development Officer for KFC Australia, said she was excited to bring an entirely new kind of concept to Parramatta locals and Sydney-siders.

'Our existing KFC menu is designed to appeal to the broad Australian population - in some locations, such as our Church Street store, where the customer base is predominantly working adult Australians, we wanted to trial a smaller menu more targeted to their needs,' Ms Lawson said.

'For this reason we have reduced the menu to some core favourites and added a few additional items that we believe will hold appeal to this audience. 

'These new items bring the great taste of KFC to life with new ingredients such as red quinoa, jalapeño sauces, basmati rice and corn salsa,' she added.

Wraps filled with lettuce, tasty cheese, original chicken and a variety of sauces are on the menu

Some favourites from the traditional KFC menu are also available 

It is freshly prepared in store and KFC hopes to add more concept stores to their portfolio

'So while the store has some new taste combinations, it is still distinctly KFC at its heart, emphasising great tasting food, freshly prepared in store to our unique recipes.' 

Depending on the success of the Paramatta store - which is aimed at young urban professionals - KFC may look to add additional custom restaurants to its portfolio.

Aaron Hedi, Restaurant General Manager at KFC Australia's new dining experience is looking forward to welcoming Parramatta locals and workers.

Bowls cost $10 at the specialised eatery and have been introduced in response to changing market

Customers can choose from a range of fillings and sauces for lunch or dinner

Located at 277B Church Street, the store will be open from 11am until 9pm seven days a week

'I'm excited to see how our customers will respond to the new concept,' Mr Hedi said. 

'I grew up in the Parramatta area and have been involved in developing the look and feel of the store. We've tried to make it as local as possible, and we'll be adding more personal touches to the experience so that we're truly part of the local community,' he continued.
