A bride spent her wedding night in jail after fatally shooting her niece in a bar fight Thursday night in New Brighton, Pennsylvania. 

Katelyn Francis, 21, was drinking with her 30-year-old aunt Christina George-Harvan Thursday night, just hours after George-Harvan tied the knot with new husband Jeremy Harvan.

The three were in the parking lot of Jimmy K's Bar and Grille when they got into a fight about who was going to drive and George-Harvan pulled out a pistol and shot Francis, authorities say.

'Everybody
 in the bar noticed that there was something going on with the people, 
but nobody knew exactly what was happening,' witness James Botinovich 
told KDKA. 'The next thing you know we heard someone got shot...looked out, noticed it was right by my car.'

Police
 responded to the scene around 10pm Thursday and arrested George-Harvan,
 booking her in Beaver County Jail for the first night of her honeymoon. 

Paramedics rushed Francis to UPMC Presbyterian, but she died en route.

Charges: George-Harvan has been charged with homicide, aggravated assault and reckless endangerment

Francis was from Fairview, West Virginia, a small town 75 miles south of Pittsburgh.

Deanne Chenoweth, a friend and former co-worker of the victim, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Francis was a single mother who left behind a young son named Kody. Before her death, Chenoweth says Katelyn worked as a cashier at a Shop 'n Save grocery store.

According to her Facebook, Francis was also married to a woman named Kayla Bender, and tied the knot on April 4.

While
 her aunt has been identified as Christina George-Harvan, the suspect's 
legal name may be Francis as well since she registered for a marriage 
license as Christina N Francis of Conway, Pennsylvania.

Her new husband is from Freedom and the .9mm Glock is registered to his name. 

Mrs George-Harvan faces one count of homicide, two counts of aggravated assault and one count reckless endangerment.
