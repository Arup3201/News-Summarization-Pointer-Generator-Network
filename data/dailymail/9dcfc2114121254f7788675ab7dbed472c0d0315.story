A Spanish bakery is selling what it claims to be the world's most expensive bread at £93 a loaf.

Each 400g (14oz) bread made at the Pan Piña bakery contains wholewheat flour, spelt and dehydrated honey.

But what makes this otherwise ordinary loaf extra special? It is also given a 250mg sprinkling of one key extra ingredient:  gold dust.

The gold leaf bread costs €117 (£93) and is exported to buyers around the world. 

It is especially popular in the Costa del Sol region, Russia and Middle Eastern countries, says Juan Manuel Moreno, 41, baker and co-owner at Pan Piña.

Moreno's family has been running the bakery in the small village of Algatocin, Malaga Province, Andalusia, for 70 years.

Today, Moreno produces more than 50 types of bread in his shop. 

The gold loaf is his most expensive and incorporates edible gold both inside and outside of the bread.

The gold in each loaf has a value of £79, he says, and while he confesses the glitz adds no extra flavour, it does leave buyers with a taste of 'exclusivity' and 'glamour'.

Speaking at the Malaga bread fair food festival, Moreno explained: 'The gold itself has no real taste. It just adds a certain sparkle, a lustre to each loaf.

'The rest of the ingredients are organic and super healthy. People believe small amounts of gold are good for the digestion.' 

He added: 'We have a lot of wealthy visitors from Russia and China here and they are always looking for something new to show how rich they are.'

The loaves are aimed at the upper crust of society including wealthy Russian and Chinese customer

The bread, which Moreno says is popular with Arab, Russian and Chinese buyers, is left to rise

Moreno told Spain's ABC newspaper he came up with the idea after seeing the 'world's most expensive coffee' on sale at another business in the region.

He says Arab, Russian and Chinese buyers based on the Costa de Sol have shown the most interest in the bread.

However, a national supermarket chain is set to start selling the product while a restaurant in Ronda has expressed an interest.
