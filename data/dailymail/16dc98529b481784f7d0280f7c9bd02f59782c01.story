Alex Trebek has become the latest celebrity to get sucked into Sony's ever growing email hack scandal after messages emerged Tuesday of the game show host all but threatening to quit over a Jeopardy Kids episode.

Per the emails, the behind the scenes drama began when an 11-year-old little girl ran off the stage after losing in a December episode and ended when producers assented to her mother's demands to reshoot the segment, causing the host of 30 years' ire to flare.

'When I’m vilified, corporate (and certainly legal) always seems to say ‘don’t say anything and it’ll blow over,’ and I’m not feeling support from the producers, and that disappoints the s*** out of me,' Trebek snapped, in an email Radar reports he dictated to an assistant.

Furious: Alex Trebek all but threatened to quit Jeopardy after a little girl's tantrum over losing out on appearing in Final Jeopardy eventually caused producers to ask him to reshoot the segment

 

The request to reshoot reportedly came after the contestant was in the red prior to Final Jeopardy and per the rules was unable to finish the game with the other two players.

She ran off, according to her mother, because 'she was upset about not being able to completely play the game to the end.'

The mother said Trebek, meanwhile, seemed totally uninterested in consoling the girl. 

'I don’t think I’ll ever forgive him for that,' the mother told producers.

When he was asked to retape, Trebek came about as close as one can to threatening to walk.

'If I’m making mistakes and saying things you don’t like, maybe it’s time for me to move on,' he told 'It’s not a threat, but I want to let you know how I’m feeling.'

Now, as Sony's headache grows thanks to an unprecedented email leak, they're likely counting their lucky stars that Trebek didn't take the threat a step further.

Sony Pictures Entertainment now faces two lawsuits from four former employees who claim the company did not do enough to prevent hackers from stealing nearly 50,000 social security numbers, salary details and other personal information from current and former workers.

The lawsuits seek to gain class-action status on behalf of those employees whose private data, including medical records, have been released by hackers in recent weeks.

Two employees sued Sony in federal court on Monday, alleging the company failed to secure its computer systems despite "weaknesses that it has known about for years," and instead made a business decision to accept the risk. It contends that the latest data breaches are especially "surprising and egregious" because Sony Pictures has been repeatedly attacked over the years, including a 2011 hack that revealed millions of user accounts on Sony's PlayStation video-game network.

On Tuesday, two former movie production workers sued Sony in Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming the company waited too long to notify employees that their data had been stolen. The case filed by Susan Dukow and Yvonne Yaconelli alleges Sony violated California laws meant to protect sensitive financial and medical information.

The hack attack against Sony Entertainment is airing the film studio's dirty laundry in public - revealing. Revelations from tens of thousands of emails - many of them from Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal - have rocked Hollywood for nearly two weeks.
