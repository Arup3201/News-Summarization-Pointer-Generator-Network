Chelsea captain John Terry showed Blues fans where it all began as he took a trip down memory lane on his Instagram account.

The 34-year-old Barking-born defender posted a picture of himself on a summer football camp alongside his brother and West Ham United legend Trevor Brooking.

Terry’s snap shows him donning a retro Chelsea shirt while his brother Paul wears a Rangers shirt on the football course.

A young Terry is seen clutching a shiny trophy, so it is clear to see the former England international has been a natural born winner ever since a young age.

The trophies have just kept coming for Terry since that day and he will be hoping to add to his collection with the Premier League title this season.

Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea side are currently six points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand over nearest rivals Manchester City.

The trophies just keep coming for Terry who celebrates winning the Capital One Cup earlier this year
