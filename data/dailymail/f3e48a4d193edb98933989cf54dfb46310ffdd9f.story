A woman has been charged after she fired a gun into the air to scare off boys who were attacking her teenage daughter.Â 

Lakisha Gaither, 35, released one round from the gun she legally owns on Saturday night after a boy punched her daughter in the face during a fight near their home in Woodbridge, Virginia.

The dispute kicked off shortly after 9pm between Ms Gaither, her 15-year-old daughter Brianna Stewart and another mother and daughter.

Brianna Stewart, 15, disappeared from her grandmother's house on Sunday night. She and her mother Lakisha Gaither were involved in an altercation with a group of boys on Saturday, leading her mother to fire a gun into the air to disperse them

As Ms Gaither and Brianna walked home, they were followed by a group of ten boys into the parking lot of their apartment complex.

Lakisha Gaither was charged with reckless use of a weapon but said that she was just protecting her teenage daughter from a fight

One boy began insulting them and grabbed the teenage girl's shirt before hitting her.

The mother said that she just wanted the boy to stop hitting her daughter.

She told the Washington Times: 'I stopped and turned to walk to the 
middle of the parking lot. I made sure no one was around me.

'I unholstered my gun, pointed it straight in the air and fired just one
shot to get him off my child.'

The mother then stood and waited for police officers to arrive on the scene. She was charged with reckless use of a weapon.

The mother said that she was unrepentant about her use of a weapon as she had to protect her child.

Prince William County police said that
the woman should have called police instead of firing the bullet into 
the air as it could have come down and hit someone.

Ms Gaither's daughter went missing from her grandmother's house on Sunday following the incident and there is still no sign of her.

The mother has posted a frantic series of messages on her Facebook page asking for her daughter's safe return.

In the latest message, she posted: 'THE POLICE THINK BRIANNA HAS BEEN SPOTTED IN RESTON, VA BY THE BEST BUY.

'I am on my way in that direction. If anyone is in that area please, please keep you eyes open for my baby.'

Ms Gaither is due in court on October 30 for her arraignment on gun charges.
