Pounding music, vibrant costumes and the smell of Caribbean food have signalled that London's annual Notting Hill Carnival is well and truly underway.

The capital has been taken over by Europe's biggest street festival with dancers and musicians parading through the streets joined by crowds of visitors, and 7,000 police officers on patrol to keep order in west London.

More than one million people are expected to attend the Caribbean celebration over the course of the Bank Holiday weekend, with warm weather drawing larger crowds than expected yesterday, while rain is predicted today.

Revellers who do brave the rain will be treated to a jam packed programme, with 60 bands on the bill for what is known as the 'adult day' of the annual festival.

By 9pm last night police had made 95 arrests, including five for possession of offensive weapons, 35 drugs arrests and 10 for common assault.

The numbers were down on day one of last year's event when a total of 111 arrests were made, most of them for drug and public order offences. In total officers had arrested 301 people during the 2013 carnival.

The event is one of the largest operations in the Metropolitan Police force's calendar. Chief Superintendent Robyn Williams said the force's priority is to 'facilitate a safe and vibrant carnival'.

She said: 'Carnival very much presents us with two extremes; those who want to enjoy the sound systems, cuisine and have a good time and those who use it as an opportunity to commit crime.'

Children's
 Day saw family-friendly floats make their way from Westbourne Park 
Underground station to Ladbroke Grove. However, the thumping bass of the
 sound systems was as loud as ever. Organisers said this year marks the first milestone in the build-up to the event's 50th anniversary in 2016.

Michelle
 Johns, 44, from Lincoln, who was watching the procession with her 
husband and two daughters yesterday said the atmosphere was great.

'It's brilliant fun. Everyone is friendly and having a great time,' she said.

Theresa
 Smith, 69, who lives in South London but is originally from St Vincent 
in the Caribbean, helped to make costumes for children joining the South
 Connections band which took part in the procession.

She said: 'I love the carnival, I've come every year since 1987.

'For two days of the year the streets of London are mine as a West Indie.

'The
 Caribbean community comes together and we celebrate. Celebrate the 
diversity, the culture, the mix of nationalities in London.'

As the event has grown in fame and popularity over the years, the costumes of those taking part in the processions have grown more and more elaborate

Police warned visitors to be alert and take steps to reduce their vulnerability to low level crime by not wearing valuable jewellery or holding mobile phones on show

A
 number of business owners and residents have boarded up their 
properties on the carnival route in a bid to avoid damage. A gang crime 
crackdown in the run-up to the party has seen 157 arrests and the 
seizure of guns, drugs and thousands of pounds in cash.

As
 part of Operation Kent officers retrieved two machine guns and a 
handgun, crack cocaine and around £78,000 in cash. Officers known as 
'super-recognisers' are primed to spot those banned from the event, as 
well as gangs and groups who attend.

However Chief Superintendent Williams said the arrests did not indicate the level of crime expected at the event.

She
 said: 'The proactive, pre-emptive focus of the carnival was highly 
effective. The success of the operation doesn't present a direct 
correlation of what may or may not happen.' 

She
 added: 'The most serious violent crime at the event has reduced over 
the years and considering the number of people here we have a relatively
 low crime rate.'

However
 she warned visitors to be alert and take steps to reduce their 
vulnerability to low level crime by not wearing valuable jewellery or 
holding mobile phones on show and considering how much they drink.

Asked
 about the planning which goes into the police operation, she said: 'Let
 me put it this way, on Tuesday morning we'll begin planning Notting 
Hill Carnival 2015.'

The
 event has taken place since 1966, when it was introduced to improve 
race relations in the area. The event has become increasingly popular in
 recent years and now contributes an estimated £93million to the local 
economy.

Safety
 concerns about the number of people packing into the narrow streets 
have led some to suggest the event be moved to Hyde Park. But many say 
such a move would take away the tradition of the carnival.
