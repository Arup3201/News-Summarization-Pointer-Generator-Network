A Spanish man found dead in his apartment in Bangkok on the eve of his 37th birthday had live blogged his suicide on his Facebook page, Thai police said today.

Friends in Spain alerted police after midnight on Wednesday when they became worried by his desperate posts on the social network alongside a photograph of a potentially fatal drug.

Thai police today said it is believed the man, who has not been named, died after drinking a glass of beer containing poison.

Lieutenant Colonel Apichan Sawasdibud 
said: 'His friends alerted us after he posted a photo of a glass full of
some kind of drug.

'His friend's sister, who is a pharmacist, warned them that it was a dangerous drug that could cause death.'

Lt Col Apichan said friends and neighbours described the dead man, who had been working for a telecoms company in Thailand for around a year, as a generally cheerful person.

Around 30 minutes before committing suicide he had emailed his resignation to his boss, telling him to contact his friends for an explanation.

Lt Col Apichan said: 'It's clear that he committed suicide because his room was locked from the inside.'

The man, who has not been identified, would have turned 37 today.

Earlier this week, a Canadian man used his Facebook account to post an angry rant shortly before he murdered his two children and killed himself.

Jocelyn Marcoux, 47, is thought to have killed son Lindsey Brillant-Marcoux, 13, and daughter Karen Brillant-Marcoux, nine, before taking his own life at the family home in Warwick, Quebec, in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

Just hours earlier, Mr Marcoux took to his Facebook page to post a lengthy email denouncing the Quebec family court system for 'favouring' mothers over fathers.

Writing in French, he said: 'I swore in my heart as a father that my children would never children be mistreated again, not even with the blessing of a hypocrite judge...

'For fathers, it's official - if you don't take justice into your own hands, you'll never have justice.'

Nadine Brillant, the children's mother, wrote on her own Facebook page in a post that was later deleted: 'My ex has killed my children. I am crushed.'
