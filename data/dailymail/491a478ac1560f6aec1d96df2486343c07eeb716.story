You had one job, ground crew.

Staff at New York's Yankee stadium tussled with a storm cover for 13 minutes - leaving the infield so drenched that a win had to be declared for the home team.

Thunder and lightning hit last night when the Yankees were leading 2-1 in their fifth innings against the Texas Rangers, and the protective tarp should have taken 60 seconds to roll out.

Starting well: When thunder and lightning lashed New York's Yankee Stadium last night, the ground crew starting rolling out their protective tarp - but within seconds the situation had turned into an amusing farce

Bring backup! As the tarp was being rolled out, it became too weighed down to drag across the infield

But it became so drenched in the few seconds it took to unfurl that it was too heavy to drag the rest of the way across the field.

As fans fled the torrential rain, chaos ensued as the ground crew first folded the tarp back over itself, then called for reinforcements.

Minutes ticked by as they pulled at the sides of the gigantic cover, but it was in vain - it just wouldn't budge.

Almost instantly the loose dirt in the stadium had turned to mud, splashing up onto the legs of the dejected crew and sucking down the tarp even harder.

Commentators observed how crews practice bringing on the tarp time and time again to get it right, but what they were left with was a 'mess'.

Dejected: A member of the ground staff pulls in vain at the giant sheet. Eventually the ball boys got involved

Chaos: Most fans didn't stick around to see the sodden crew struggle with the tarp, as they were soaked too

Eventually
 more than 25 people including ball boys heaved the heavy sheet over the
 infield, with some of them clambering underneath to prevent it getting 
stuck to the ground.

An ironic cheer went up around the 50,000-capacity baseball stadium as the Yankees themselves looked on from the dugout, bemused.

It did not escape anyone's notice that the umpires then had to declare Yankees the winner - because the infield was so wet they could not continue playing.

Fans on Twitter accused the crew of sabotaging the game deliberately to secure a win for the Yankees, who lost 4-2 in a game on Tuesday which included rookie errors by pitcher Shane Greene.

@_rallycap tweeted: 'A tarp has helped the Yankees more than A-Rod this year.'

Soaked: The Yankees' Francisco Cervelli, who had been on second base, runs off the field as the rain hits

And 
Twitter user Jeff Johnson simply wrote: 'The Yankees sabotaged the 
pulling of the tarp and let the rain ruin the field for the victory.'

When
 journalists asked Rangers manager Ron Washington to comment on the 
claim, he replied: 'I’m not going to answer that one, man,' NJ.com reported.

But
 he added: 'Those guys have been doing that for a long time and I don’t 
think it was intentional. But usually when they start pulling the tarp 
it makes it. That one didn’t make it.'
