A moneybroker from Kent, England, is being held in a Florida jail after his drunken, violent behavior forced a British Airways flight to make an emergency landing in Orlando.

Sean Jude Kelly, 31, is accused of spitting on flight attendants and 'trying to pick fights with every passenger he made eye-contact with' on Sunday following a boozy, week-long vacation in Cancun, Mexico.

Kelly sustained injuries to his face after he tried to attack a female Orlando police officer and threatened to kill her as he was being hauled off the plane, authorities said. He shouted 'Let's have a go' as he shadow-boxed in his jail cell, according to reports.

Before his March 31 flight to Mexico, he tweeted about taking Valium, an anti-anxiety pill, before takeoff. Flight crews told police that he drank half a bottle of vodka on the plane on Sunday.

Danger: British Airways says it diverted BA2022 to Orlando because Kelly was being disruptive on the flight. The passengers' arrival at Gatwick Airport in London was delayed two hours

Flight BA2202 arrived at London's Gatwick Airport two hours late as a result of the detour to Orlando.

The 278 passengers aboard were delayed about an hour while Orlando police officers boarded the plane and took Kelly into custody.

An Orlando police report reveals Kelly had consumed half of a 750ml bottle of Stolichnaya Vodka on board the plane when he became violent.

Pictures from his Facebook and Twitter feed show that he spent his vacation at a Cancun boozing heavily.

'Sunday night rolled into Monday day knocking back daquiris and blasting Mexicos finest ;-) I failed man, as you will see..,' he he wrote on Tuesday.

On Thursday, he posted a photo on Facebook of himself holding a half-finished frozen daiquiri.

Before his Mexican holiday, he tweeted about his nerves on the plane.

On March 29, he sent a tweet to the British rapper Wiley saying: 'listening to 'Daiquiris' and popping Valiums, only way to get through take off..#madfearofflying #cancun #rattlingwithpills'

Earlier he said: 'Looking forward to bricking it for the next 11 hours on a plane. If it goes down, I want (British Pop Idol finalist Rik Waller) singing at my funeral #cancun.'

The captain of the British Airways jet landed in Orlando about 8pm, less than three hours after takeoff from Cancun.

Fighty: Police said Kelly, who lists his profession as 'moneybroker,' tried to kick a female police officer

Flight officials told police that Kelly had consumed had spit on flight attendants and had attempted to fight every passenger within his line of sight.

As officers carried him off the plane, he began wearing at them. He then looked at a female officer and said 'I'm going to kill you.'

As he tried to kick the officer, another swept his leg out from underneath him and dropped him to the floor, smashing his face against the carpet, according to a report.

He continued to resist and had to be knocked to the floor once more before being taken to a holding cell at the airport.

Once inside, he continued to shout obscenities at police.

'You're dead you fat f***,' he allegedly shouted at officers, while shadow-boxing in his cell. 'Let's have a go.'

He is charged with assault on a law enforcement officer and resiting arrest. He is being held on $5,300 bail.
