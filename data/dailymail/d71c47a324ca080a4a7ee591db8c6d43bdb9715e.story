Britain was left out in the cold 
yesterday as EU leaders signed  a controversial treaty which  critics 
say could herald the dawn of a two-tier Europe.

Furious Tory MPs last night argued 
Britain would be pushed to the margins of European decision-making and 
renewed their calls for a referendum on whether we should now leave the 
EU.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel 
described the new Fiscal Compact – a desperate attempt to save the 
single currency – as a ‘great leap’ and a ‘milestone’ towards stability 
and political union.

Under the treaty,  eurozone countries
 will scrutinise each other’s budgets and the European Court of Justice 
will be able to fine them if they fail to stick to the rules.

But the new treaty’s credibility was 
already under threat last night after both Spain and the Netherlands 
admitted they will miss targets for reducing their deficits.

Britain and the Czech republic were 
the only two EU countries who refused to sign the agreement during a 15 
minute ceremony in Brussels yesterday.

Bitter pill to swallow: But Prime Minister David Cameron insisted Britain's voice had been heard at the EU

The event was presided over by  Herman Van Rompuy, who had earlier been re-appointed unopposed as European President.

David Cameron vetoed plans to change the EU treaties to enforce greater budgetary discipline during a summit in December.

European President Herman Van Rompuy has been handed another two years in power without an election.

Mr Van Rompuy, 64, who had no rivals for the post, received the backing of all EU leaders including David Cameron.

The Belgian politician will remain as European Council supremo until 2014. Mr Van Rompuy was virtually unknown on the world stage when he was appointed as the council’s first president in 2009.

Since then, he has presided over the Eurozone crisis. The Belgian enjoys a £250,000 salary which is almost double that of Mr Cameron.

He triggered outrage on the eve of his second term this week by claiming national parliaments are now EU institutions.

He said: ‘Decisions by one national parliament – be it in Germany or Ireland, in Slovakia or Portugal – are watched all over Europe.

‘Maybe not formally speaking, but at least politically speaking, all national parliaments have become, in a way, European institutions.’

The Treaty for Stability, 
Co-ordination and Governance was drawn up to prevent the 17 eurozone 
states running up  huge debts like those which sparked the Greek, Irish 
and Portuguese bailouts.

But Tory MP Bill Cash said: ‘We now 
have two Europes, both built on sand. It is essential that we have a 
referendum in this country so that the people can have their say.

‘The whole treaty is a vain attempt to sacrifice practicality and democracy on the altar of ideology.

‘The new treaty is the triumph of expediency over the law.’

Tory MP Douglas Carswell added: 
‘These European leaders have gone ahead with this arrangement despite 
Britain’s veto and we are powerless to stop it.

‘First of all we were promised a 
referendum, then we were told there was a veto. The lesson we have 
learned from all of this is we cannot trust the EU mandarin elite. Sixty
 million people in this country have been had.’

Earlier, Mrs Merkel hailed the Fiscal Compact as ‘a milestone in the history of the European Union’.

She said: ‘I think it’s a strong 
signal that we have learned from the crisis and understood the signals 
and that we are banking on the future of a politically united Europe.’

In a speech at the signing ceremony, 
Herman Van Rompuy said: ‘This stronger self-constraint by each and every
 one of you as regards debts and deficits is important in itself.

‘It helps prevent a repetition of the
 sovereign debt crisis. It will thus also reinforce trust among member 
states, which is politically important as well.’

Speaking the same language: French President Nicolas Sarkozy, left, chats with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, center, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel

President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, said it was a strong political statement for the EU.

‘In the eyes of the world what is at stake is the very credibility of the euro area and of Europe as a whole,’ he said.

But the plight of debt-riddled Spain and the Netherlands cast a shadow over proceedings.

Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy said his country’s budget deficit would be 5.8 per cent of GDP  this year – about £12.5billion more than the 4.4 per cent agreed with Brussels.

A minority of two: David Cameron and his Czech counterpart Petr Necas, pictured outside Downing Street, were the only two EU leaders not to sign up to the new fiscal pact designed to impose stronger financial discipline on the eurozone

With the Netherlands – one of the few AAA-rated countries left in the eurozone – also struggling to hit budget targets, the credibility of the new deal was already under threat.

The fiscal compact will now go before national parliaments and, in the case of the Irish Republic, a referendum.

To take effect, the pact must be ratified by 12 eurozone states.

Demands: Prime Minister David did eventually get his voice heard

David Cameron yesterday claimed a minor victory after he forced EU leaders to accept British plans to cut red tape and boost growth.

The Prime Minister admitted he had been left ‘frustrated’ when his calls for deregulating some professional services and helping small businesseses were initially ignored.

Mr Cameron, whose proposals were set out in a letter backed by 11 other countries, revealed he had been forced to ‘bang the table’ to get his ‘voice heard’.

However Nicholas Sarkozy claimed the PM only drafted the letter to prevent Britain being ‘left behind’.

He said: ‘What a tribute this is to Europe, to send Europe such a lovely letter.

‘Usually if you write a letter signed by other friends, you are either announcing that you are leaving or saying you love someone.

‘I take Mr Cameron’s letter, after his decision not to join this latest treaty, as a sign that he doesn’t want to get left behind.’
