BlackBerry has sold around one million of the new Z10 smartphones it hopes will help restore the firm to the top table in mobile technology.

The handset's performance is widely seen as being key to the company's fortunes after a difficult couple of years when the firm lost ground and customers to rivals including Apple and Samsung.

Today, the mobile giant announced a return to profitability in the most recent quarter and posted earnings of 98 million US dollars (£65 million) after recording a substantial loss in the same period last year.

The Z10 will be available in black and white - just like Apple's iPhone 5

Its president and chief executive Thorsten Heins said customers "love" the new device which was launched in January with the motto "redesigned, re-engineered, re-invented". 

'We have implemented numerous changes at BlackBerry over the past year and those changes have resulted in the company returning to profitability in the fourth quarter,' Mr Heins said.

'With the launch of BlackBerry 10, we have introduced the newest and what we believe to be the most innovative mobile computing platform in the market today.'

He said the company would remain focused on improving its profitability and efficiency while driving innovation in the next fiscal year.

'We have built an engine that is able to drive improved financial performance at lower volumes, which should allow us to generate additional benefits from higher volumes in the future,' he added.The one million Z10 phones sold bettered analysts' expectations of about 915,000.

When the Z10 touchscreen device was unveiled, Mr Heins welcomed a 'new day in the history of BlackBerry' following what he termed the most challenging year of his career.

The firm's market share fell from 41per cent in 2007, when the first iPhone came out, to 4% in the first quarter of last year.

BlackBerry drew widespread criticism after an "outage" in October 2011 which saw millions of people around the world left unable to access emails, surf the web or use BlackBerry Messenger (BBM).

The Z10 went on sale in the UK earlier this year.

In today's report, BlackBerry said it shipped around six million handsets in the three months to March 2.

Revenue has fallen by 36% to 2.7 billion US dollars (£1.8 billion) in the past year. In the fourth quarter, the company recorded a 2% dip, with revenue down by about 49 million US dollars (£32.4 million) on the previous three months.

The fourth quarter results show BlackBerry - formerly known as Research In Motion - has lost about three million subscribers in the past three months, a figure which now stands at 76 million.

Stuart Miles, founder of technology and gadget site Pocket-lint, said the shipping of one million Z10 handsets in three months was unlikely to be enough to ensure a turnaround for BlackBerry.

'The UK did not take to the Z10 as well as it has done to other devices out there,' he said.

'The iPhone 5 took three days to sell a million and the SGS4 (Samsung's latest offering) will probably take the same time.'

President and Chief Executive Officer of Resarch in Motion (RIM), Thorsten Heins, promoted the new BlackBerry touch screen handsets together with US singer Alicia Keys in New York City, in January

He added: 'I think the more worrying thing is the fact that they have lost around 33,000 subscribers every day for the last three months.

'If that continues at the same rate, and obviously they are hoping it won't, they are losing what amounts to 12 million a year. That's five years and they're out.

'Unless they can change that exodus, there won't be anybody left to use the system, no matter how good it is.'

The BlackBerry, pioneered in 1999, was the dominant smartphone among businesses before the arrival of the iPhone in 2007.

The Z10 received favourable reviews after it went on sale in the UK, about two months before its US launch.
