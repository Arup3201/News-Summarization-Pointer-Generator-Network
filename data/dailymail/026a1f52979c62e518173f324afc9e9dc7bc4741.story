The friends and family of a wealthy socialite, found murdered in his £2million home, have described him as 'too trusting' as they reveal fears that many were 'after his money.'

Robert Troyan, 63, was discovered with a gash to his head in a pool of blood by his maid in the kitchen of his luxury rented Mayfair flat.

A post-mortem examination confirmed he died of head injuries and police are now investigating.

His mother, Marie, 83, has described her son as 'one in a million' but said there had been a 'terrible change in circumstances' after the death of his late partner, architect and interior designer Anthony Feldman - whose clients included Princess Michael of Kent and former Tory Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken.

Trusting: Friends of Mr Troyan described him as a 'larger than life' character, who 'trusted strangers too much'

Murder probe launched: The body of Robert Troyan, 63, was discovered at his luxury flat in this apartment block in Mount Street, Mayfair

The couple were the first to become civil partners, and the ceremony was held just a month before Mr Feldman’s death at 52.

Friends of Mr Troyan described him as a 'larger than life' character, who 'trusted strangers too much'.

Sean
McGuigan, who had known Mr Troyan since 2006, told the Evening Standard he thought
many who were around the socialite were after his money and that his 
home contained many expensive antiques, including a £100,000 vase.

He said he was 'too trusting', and added: 'He would lavish gifts on people and was quite carefree with his money.'

Mrs Troyan told the paper that Mr Feldman had been the love of her son's life. 

She said: 'When you are in love with someone they can become your world and that was how it was with Robert. He lost his support network.'

Before Mr Feldman’s death, the couple 
were famed for their lavish Mayfair dinner parties where guests said the
champagne was ‘always chilled and ready to open’.

The Met Police said it was still appealing for witnesses and said that officers could not confirm whether anything had been taken from the flat at this point in the investigation.

Mr Troyan is believed to have spoken 
to his maid by phone only two hours before his body was found last 
Friday afternoon.

After making the grim discovery when she arrived at 
the mansion block at 4pm, she collapsed on her knees in hysterical 
screams.

The building's caretaker said retired American Mr Troyan's regular cleaner was 'uncontrollable' after finding his body on Friday afternoon

A source at the block said: ‘It was a head wound, there was blood pouring on the floor.

‘Workmen working above – they are 
doing a new kitchen – heard her screaming and shouting. The workmen said
they didn’t touch his body, but could tell that he wasn’t breathing.’

‘His cleaner was inconsolable. The 
police had to take her to the police station, and she was on her hands 
and knees crying her eyes out.’

The source said Mr Troyan was always 
friendly but ‘would often be visited by strange men, at all times of the
day and night’, at the flat, which he rented.

Black bags removed from the flat every
morning could be heard ‘rattling with bottles’. He added: ‘One guy who 
visited was staggering a lot. This was in the afternoon. I think it was 
just drink, not drugs. He never came back again.’

Mr Troyan sometimes played loud music 
and had noisy conversations, and the people in the flat below had 
complained on at least one occasion.

He was born in Italy to a wealthy 
family but lived in the US for most of his youth. Mr Troyan studied art 
at college in Boston before moving to Britain, where he met Mr Feldman 
in 1983.

An obituary in the Times after Mr 
Feldman’s death said: ‘They were both immensely kind and generous to 
people in need and to charities for the homeless. Trudie Styler enlisted
them for her and Sting’s campaign for Tibet.’

Mr Feldman came to London from 
Johannesburg as an 18-year-old to study and went on to become an 
internationally successful interior designer and architect who took on 
commissions in London, Paris, New York, Hungary and Turkey.

Affluent: Flats on the street sell for £2-3million, while a nine-bedroom property on Mount Street is currently on the market for £32million

Top of his profession: Mr Feldman's clients included Princess Michael of Kent (above) in Kensington Palace

Mr Troyan and Mr Feldman worked on 
many design projects together, but their most cherished one was the top 
two storeys of the 1782 Henry Holland house in Mayfair they shared, 
where they painted the floors and fireplace in eight shades of pale grey
and several shades of white.

Their large drawing-room was adorned 
with a Bechstein grand piano and a dining table laid with mixed old 
china, napkins specially sewn in Turkey and Bohemian glasses for their 
extravagant dinners.

They became the first to take part in a
civil partnership in Westminster in 2005 after being given dispensation
to pre-empt the official start date because Mr Feldman had terminal 
cancer. He died aged 52 eight days after the ceremony.

About six years after Mr Feldman’s 
death, Mr Troyan moved out of that flat and into the flat, also in 
Mayfair, where he was found murdered.

A neighbour in his former flat said: 
‘He [Mr Troyan] came from a very moneyed background in America.

'He was 
totally devastated by Anthony’s death. It was Anthony that really kept 
everything running smoothly in both their lives.

‘After Anthony died, there was quite a
lot of coming and going of various characters, and it caused some 
problems. Nothing would surprise me.’

Detective Chief Inspector Tim 
Duffield, from Scotland Yard’s homicide and serious crime Command, said:
‘We are appealing for anyone who knew Robert to come forward.

‘He was a very well known character in Mayfair; whom friends describe as kind and extremely generous.

‘We are confident that his murder took place on the March 8 some time before 4pm.’
