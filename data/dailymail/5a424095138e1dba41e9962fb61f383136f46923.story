A train carrying 90 cars full of crude oil derailed early Friday morning in western Alaba,a, causing three of the cars to explode and emergency officials still don't know what caused the accident.

A dozen cars derailed in the accident four miles outside of Aliceville, Alabama. The derailment caused three to explode and the fire then spread - damaging nine cars. No one on board the train or near the crash site was injured.

An undetermined amount of oil spilled into nearby water, but officials said there were no signs of a spreading slick or any threat to drinking water. Aerial photographs showed what appeared to be oil in muddy water around the wreckage.

Explosion: A train derailment early Friday morning in Aliceville, Alabama resulted in the explosion of three oil tankers, which spread to damage nine cars total and leak oil into a nearby slough

Investigation: Emergency officials still aren't sure what caused the train to derail in western Alabama. They are waiting for the fire to burn out to start their investigation

Slow: Emergency officials say that the train was moving at a slow pace when it derailed and will be looking into the role a trestle might have played in the accident

Yasamie August, a spokeswoman for Alabama Emergency Management Agency, said only one family was evacuated as a precaution but was allowed to return home soon after. 

Sheriff David Abston said the train derailed shortly after midnight near a trestle that crosses water. Flames turned the night sky orange, he said.

'It was a bright fire. It was visible from a long way,' Abston said.

Two students were hunting in the woods around the train tracks when the derailment happened. The two men headed for the crash to see if anyone needed help and found the train's two conductors who they helped drive away from the scene before the explosions happened.

Survivors: The train was carrying more than 90 tankers and a dozen derailed. Above, a picture of the front of the train. The train's two conductors survived the explosion. No injuries were reported

Oil spill: Officials aren't sure how much oil leaked into the surrounding slough, but said that a beaver dam has kept it from spreading

Witnesses: Two students were hunting wild hogs in the surrounding woods when the explosion happened and said it looked like the sun rising, and felt like an earthquake

'I saw this glowing light through the trees, I thought, it looked like the sun was coming up,' one of the students told ABC 33/40.

The force of the explosion was so strong, it shook the earth.

'Really, it was like an earthquake, it felt like an earthquake,' the student added.

Firefighters let the blaze burn out since the damage was contained to a rural area. A daytime photo released by the state emergency agency showed five tank cars standing upright on a rail bed with dark smoke visible in the background.

Pile-up: When the fire burns out and the investigation is completed, the undamaged trains will continue on their journey to Florida. The train originated in North Dakota

'It was scary, especially (with) two 
boys in the house, two little kids,' witness Heather Garner told 
WBMA-TV. 'And I was sitting outside when one tank blew. And it looked 
like fire was just coming straight toward the house.'

After
the fire burns out (which may take a few days) federal and railway 
officials will begin investigating what caused the derailment

The
accident happened in a wetlands area near a creek and the Tombigbee 
River. Regional emergency coordinator Don Hartley said it appeared some 
oil had entered the water but flames prevented a close investigation.

'Fortunately a beaver dam has caused the water to stand still,' he said. 'Any product in water wouldn’t go anywhere.'

Conductors: The trains two conductors were rescued by the two students and driven away from the crash site

Evacuation: Only one family was evacuated as a precaution but were soon allowed to return to their home

Scott Hughes, a spokesman with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, said an initial test found no contamination to drinking water.

Hartley said the short-line train, operated by the Alabama Gulf and Coast Railway, was headed to Florida from North Dakota at the time of the accident, which occurred near a trestle that appeared badly damaged after the accident. The train was moving at a slow pace when the derailment happened.

'One thing the investigation will look at is whether the trestle caused the accident of the accident damaged the trestle,' he said.

Aliceville, with about 2,400 residents, is located about 100 miles southwest of Birmingham, near the Mississippi line.
