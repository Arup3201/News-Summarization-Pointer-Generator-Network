The body of Frank Viggiano was laid to rest on Thursday in Linden, New Jersey, after the 28-year-old police officer was killed during a horrific car wreck in Staten Island last week. 

His fellow officer, Pedro Abad Jr., was driving the wrong way and smashed head-on into a truck during the crash which also killed Joseph Rodriguez, 28, and injured Linden officer Patrik Kudlac.

Records show Abad, who is now conscious in the hospital, has had two DUI arrests in the last four years.

The six-year Linden police veteran was arrested on a DUI charge in Roselle in 2011.

That arrest apparently led to no citation or violation.

Abad's license was suspended for seven months after a 2013 DUI arrest in Rahway a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission said earlier this week.

Linden police didn't comment Thursday on why Abad remained on the force or say what sanctions he may have faced. 

Prior to the most recent crash, Abad posted photos of three whiskey shots on his Instagram account. 

Linden Mayor Derek Armstead said the Union County Prosecutor's Office is handling an investigation of the Linden Police Department, New Jersey Advance media reported. 

He said: 'We spoke to prosecutor's office yesterday.

'We basically are relying on the prosecutor's office to handle the investigation. We feel that they will do a complete and thorough job.'

Armstead knew Viggiano and he spoke at the funeral.

The mayor said: 'This young man was loved by everybody in this community, he was a hard worker, we know he loved fishing, and we talked about fishing during the time I got to spend with him.

'He's going to be missed by his colleagues on the force and I think we lost a very valuable member of our police department.'

Loved ones also remembered Viggiano after the service at Linden Presbyterian Church, CBS New York reported. 

Friend Robert Thieling said: 'He was a good friend and he always helped me.

'Helped everyone, never did wrong.'
