A mother in the south Chicago suburb of Sauk Village is being charged with murder after her 17-year-old son was stabbed to death Saturday night after neighbors overheard them fighting about ice cream.

According to a spokesman at the Cook County Attorney's Office, 31-year-old mother Robin Erwin called 911 around 12:15pm on Saturday saying her 17-year-old son Diontae had walked into her knife.

When they responded they found Diontae suffering from a single stab wound in the chest and he was transported to Saint Margaret Hospital in Dyer, Indiana where he was pronounced dead at 12:41pm.

Too late: Diontae was taken to a hospital but pronounced dead just half an hour after police arrived at the residence

Witnesses say they overheard the two fighting about ice cream before the alleged stabbing. Facebook friends of the family posted their outrage that dessert would have caused a mother to kill her own son.  

Robin Erwin was arraigned in court today and charged with first degree murder. The judge set bond at $750,000. 

Another man, 21-year-old Larry Gray, has also been arrested and charged with unlawful use of a weapon.
