Arsenal fans added insult to crushing defeat for Manuel Pellegrini's side by pinching Manchester City fans' Poznan celebration and mocking them with it after Olivier Giroud scored the Gunners' final goal in their 3-0 win.

Arsene Wenger's team cruised to a comfortable victory at Wembley to win the Community Shield, thanks to goals from Giroud, Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey. 

City adopted the celebration - which involves fans linking arms, turning their backs to the pitch and then jumping up and down in unison - after Lech Poznan supporters did it against them in a Europa League match in 2010.

Despite being riled by the celebration at the time, City fans were soon using it themselves in the Premier League. 

Other clubs have since celebrated goals and important wins in a similar fashion, with Republic of Ireland using the celebration when they played in Poznan against Croatia during Euro 2012. 

Arsenal were not the first  to use the Poznan to mock City supporters, with fans of newly-promoted Cardiff City doing it when they beat them 3-2 in August 2013. 

Supporters of City's local rivals Manchester United also did it during a Manchester derby game during the 2011–12 FA Cup.
