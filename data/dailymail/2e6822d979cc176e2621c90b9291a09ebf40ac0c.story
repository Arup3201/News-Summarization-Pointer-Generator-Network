Wasim Husain started to eat his fake Pakistani passport after being challenged by officials

A fraudster used a fake passport to take a British citizenship test  then started to eat it when he was challenged, a court heard.

Ambulance service call operator Wasim Husain was jailed for eight months after he admitted he was paid £300 to sit the exam on another man's behalf. 

The 26-year-old began devouring the document after being confronted by staff who had examined the Pakistani passport he was using under an ultra-violet light.

Sarah Slater, prosecuting, told Derby Crown Court: 'The member of staff told the defendant she believed the passport was false and that he would not be sitting the citizenship test.

'He became very angry and grabbed the passport from the desk then tried to leave but the door was locked and he began to kick it.

'He then began ripping at the passport, pulling off the front page and started to eat the passport.'

The police were called to the Local Learning Centre in Derby  and Husain, who worked for West Midlands Ambulance Service, was arrested.

Miss Slater said that, in interview, he told immigration officers he had been approached by a customer at the mobile phone shop where he works at weekends in Birmingham. 

Husain said the man, who he claimed to be called Zafar Mahmood, had told him he would be paid £300 to sit the citizenship test on his behalf.

Husain of Dudley, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to possession of false identification with improper intention.

Recorder Martin Jackson QC, sentencing, told him: 'The possession of a bona fide British passport gives people the right to certain privileges and those who falsely try to obtain one are undermining the whole system of immigration control.

'You willingly accepted £300 to sit a citizenship test for another person who the prosecution tell me has never been traced. Given the need for there to be deterrents for those who try to use of false documents to try and circumvent immigration controls, there can only be one outcome - and that is custody.'

Wasim Husain, 26, was jailed for eight months after pleading guilty to possession of false identification 

Mohammed Sarwar, defending, said Husain's wife was pregnant with twins and that he was the 'sole carer' for both parents.

Mr Sarwar also showed the court references from Dudley Central Mosque saying Husain was a 'valued volunteer' there, and produced a letter from the ambulance service confirming it would sack Husain if he was jailed.

He said: 'This offence took place at a time when he was struggling financially.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said he could 'confirm disciplinary action has started' after Husain was jailed.
