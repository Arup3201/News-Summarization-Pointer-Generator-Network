A fist-pumping run down the line, a win and a red card. Life is rarely dull for Neil Lennon and his start to life as a manager in England was no different.

He waited six months for this chance, first eyeing a position in the Premier League and then, in time, Cardiff and Fulham. Some of his calls were ignored, a few were answered. Ultimately, no-one seemed to want a man who led Celtic to a win over Barcelona.

So here is at Bolton. They were bottom of the Championship going into this one; they finished it with only their second win of the season.

He demonstrated his energy for management with a Mourinho-style dance down the line when Matt Mills headed Bolton in front. He stayed standing in his tracksuit when the heavens opened in the second half, eyes bulging and yelling instructions. He ended in the stands after the dust settled from Bolton’s late penalty, which they missed. What drama.

For Birmingham, it means they have now won only once in 11 games in all competitions. It is a run made more understandable when you consider how they defended in the first half here.

Perhaps the penny did not drop when Jay Spearing, once of Liverpool, delivered a perfect corner into the box after 10 minutes and found Dorian Dervite unmarked. Dervite’s header went wide and any message about the dangers of Spearing’s deliveries, not to mention the perils of poor marking, apparently went by the wayside.

Moments later, Jermaine Beckford was allowed to waste a free header in Birmingham’s area and after 20 minutes, Spearing sent over the cross that put Bolton in front. Again, the delivery was precise; again Birmingham’s defence did not serve its most basic purpose. Mills buried the header and Lennon went for a touchline jog.

In between those efforts, Birmingham did come close. Indeed, creating chances wasn’t their problem. In Demarai Gray and Koby Arthur, they had two attacking players who offered something to get excited about; in David Cotterill they have a player who can hit a fine free-kick, as he did in the 17th minute when he clipped the bar.

Gray’s chance a moment later was arguably better. Clayton Donaldson had dug out a cross from the right-hand byline and Gray timed his run perfectly. Unfortunately for him, his half volley was drilled into the ground and bounced over.

After Mill’s opener, there were further chances for Birmingham; further misses for Lee Clark to regret.

Arthur ended a delightful run by shooting into the side-netting and Gray went on an exciting surge, holding off Neil Danns as he went. His curling shot from the edge of the area was well saved by Andrew Lonergan.

It was encouraging, but tangible rewards are what the crowd want and the club need. Birmingham were loudly booed off at half time.

Danns scuffed wide for Bolton early in the second half and Gray came close to levelling 20 minutes from time, cutting in from the left and drawing a good save from Lonergan at his near post. Arthur then wasted a better chance by launching a half volley over the bar from eight yards.

Lennon swapped his gilet for a tracksuit top and Bolton dug in. They still had the greater share of possession, but Birmingham were having the chances. Gray’s effort from the left, which Lonergan tipped onto the bar, underlined the point.

Darren Pratley sent a weak shot wide in retaliation before substitute Craig Davies skied an 83rd-minute penalty that would have wrapped it up. Davies had won the spot kick after being brought down by Darren Randolph, who was sent off. Lee Novak took the gloves as Birmingham had used all their substitutes, but did not need them. In the confusion, Lennon was sent to the stands.

A colourful start to life in English management.
