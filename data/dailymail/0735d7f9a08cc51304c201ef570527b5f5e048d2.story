Pivoting planets that lean one way and then change direction could be ideal places for alien life to thrive.

This is according to a Nasa research team who claim 'wobbling' worlds would expose their surfaces to a more even heat from their suns.

The theory suggests that planets further out from their stars - outside what is known as the habitable zone - could be kept from turning into icy worlds.

A drunken planet? Tilted orbits might make some planets wobble like a top that's almost done spinning, an effect that could maintain liquid water on the surface

And with some water remaining liquid on the surface long-term, such planets could maintain favourable conditions for life, scientists claim.

‘Planets like these are far enough from their stars that it would be easy to write them off as frozen, and poor targets for exploration, but in fact, they might be well-suited to supporting life,’ said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, a Nasa astrobiologist.

‘This could expand our idea of what a habitable planet looks like and where habitable planets might be found.’

Where are these wobbling worlds? Scientists have already spotted an arrangement of planets where this wobbling effect could happen, in orbit around the star Upsilon Andromedae

Though it might seem far-fetched for a world to experience such see-sawing action, scientists have already spotted an arrangement of planets where this could happen, in orbit around the star Upsilon Andromedae. 

There, the orbits of two enormous planets were found to be inclined at an angle of 30 degrees relative to each other.

Compared to our solar system, that arrangement looks extreme. The orbits of Earth and its seven neighboring planets differ by seven degrees at most.

Even the tilted orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto, which really stands out, is offset by a relatively modest 17 degrees.

Tilted orbits might make some planets wobble like a top that's almost done spinning - an effect that could maintain liquid water on the surface.

The team at the University of Washington, Weber State University and Nasa looked at planets that have the same mass as Earth, orbit a sun-like star and have one or two gas giants orbiting nearby.

In some cases, gravitational pulls from those massive planets could change the orientation of the terrestrial world's rotation within tens to hundreds of thousands of years – a blink of an eye in geologic terms.

Alien life: The theory suggests that planets further out from their stars - outside what is known as the habitable zone - could be kept from turning into icy worlds

‘Knowing that this kind of planetary system existed raised the question of whether a world could be habitable under such conditions,’ said Rory Barnes, a scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle who was part of the team that studied the orbits of the two Andromedae planets.

Earth's history indicates that the amount of sunlight glaciers receive strongly affects how much they grow and melt. Extreme wobbling, like that seen in some models in this study, would cause the poles to point directly at the sun from time to time, melting the glaciers.

As a result, some planets would be able to maintain liquid water on the surface despite being located nearly twice as far from their stars as Earth is from the sun.

‘In those cases, the habitable zone could be extended much farther from the star than we normally expect,’ said Professor Armstrong, the lead author of the paper.

‘Rather than working against habitability, the rapid changes in the orientation of the planet could turn out be a real boon sometimes.’
