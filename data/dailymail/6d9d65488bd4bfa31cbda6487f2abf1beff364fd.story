They are a familiar sight around Paris and Rome but it seems Brooklyn Bridge is not feeling the love when it comes to padlocks.

Thousands of romantic mementos have appeared on the 1883 suspension bridge in the past few years as couples rush to make a public pledge while taking in the Manhattan skyline.

They are basic, every-day locks inscribed or doodled with dates and initials of the couple who are then supposed to throw their key in the water as a public statement of their everlasting love.

A 'love-lock' hangs on Brooklyn Bridge. Thousands have appeared on the landmark in recent years

However, the Transport Department, which maintains New York City's bridges, is calling for lovers to stop the ritual.

According to officials 5,600 locks have been removed from the bridge since July.

However, couples are still flocking to the landmark to declare their love for each other.

Krissie Walder, 31, told the New York Daily News: 'As long as this bridge is standing, our love will be too.'

Romance in France: Hundreds of locks are attached to landmarks in Paris as well as cities throughout Italy

The
 practice is popular in Europe and has had a boost in recent years from 
Federico Moccia's novel Ho Voglia di Te, which featured a couple doing 
it in Florence.

In Florence,
 Italy, thousands of locks were removed from the world famous Ponte 
Vecchio as authorities claimed it was damaging the bridge.

The
 same was done in Dublin and to try to reduce the practice in Rome a 
website was established so that couples could just leave a lock 
'virtually'.

The locks are also found in Cologne, Germany, pictured, across the Hohenzollernbruecke Bridge

Italy's capital
 is one of the most affected cities and in 2007 a lamppost on the Ponte 
Milvio reportedly collapsed due to the weight of the locks attached to 
it.Â 

Other cities believe the romantic practice attracts tourists and have even taken steps to promote it.

In Liverpool in the UK, a sign on the Albert Docks reads: 'This is a special place for lovers!

Interlock your padlocks on the railings and throw away the key into the Mersey. You will never lose

Locked: In Europe all sorts of landmarks are targeted, including this statue on the Alexandre III bridge in Paris

Among the recent wave of locks which have appeared on Brooklyn Bridge the quality of the endeavor varies massively.

Some
 couples simply pen their names on novelty locks while others take on a 
more professional approach with fully engraved or painted designs.

However,
 Nicole Garcia, Transportation Department spokesman, said the number of 
locks has increased recently which is costing authorities more to 
remove.

She added: 
'When a minor component such as a hand railing is impacted by the number
 or weight of the locks, these custom elements of this national landmark
 must be removed and a replacement must be newly fabricated, further 
increasing the costs'.
