The underage prostitute that Silvio Berlusconi had sex with during his 'bunga bunga' sex parties has revealed that she tried to kill herself in the fallout of the scandal.

The former Italian premier has been sentenced to seven years for sex with exotic dancer Ruby the Heart Stealer, then 17, at sordid sex parties at his villa outside Milan.

In Italy it is illegal to have sex with prostitutes under the age of 18. Both deny any sexual relations.

Ruby the Heart-stealer, the underage erotic dancer who was paid by Silvio Berlusconi for sex, has said that she wishes she could 'go back to being a girl who sold carpets on the beach'

He was also convicted of abusing his 
position to get her out of a police station by claiming Ruby -  real name Karima el Mahroug -  was the 
niece of the deposed Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarrak. 

The 77-year-old billionaire is currently appealing that decision.

Berlusconi
 has always maintained that his parties were 'elegant dinners' but the 
court heard of pole dancing, strip teases and erotic games.

The young Moroccan,
 who now has a daughter with her Italian boyfriend, said that she tried 
to take her own life after becoming convinced that she was seen as ‘a 
monster’ and was alone in the world.

She
 said: ‘I’ve never spoken of it before but, once, before I got pregnant I
 had a breakdown. I felt alone, totally abandoned and I thought of 
ending it.  I even tried to. I ended up in hospital. I felt the world 
was against me Against Ruby the monster.’

The former Italian premier was sentenced to seven years in jail for paying for sex with Ruby, now 22, when she was just 17. The former nightclub dancer claimed that her life had been ruined, not by the media mogul, but by those who were using her to bring down the former prime minister.

The
 crisis was overcome only thanks to becoming a mother, she said. She 
told the Italian magazine Dive e Donna: ‘Then Sofia was born. My baby 
girl gave me the strength to go on.’

Ruby
 claimed that Berlusconi had always been good to her and that she would 
remain in Italy to support him until the legal process is finished.

The former night club dancer herself faces accusations of accepting millions to lie in court about their relationship.

But
 she said: ‘I have never thought of fleeing..I will stay here until  the
 legal proceedings are over I want to be involved and go on with my 
life.  Silvio has only ever been good to me. ‘

A sentence in due in the appeal on Friday.

Berlusconi is currently carrying out a year’s sentence of community 
service for tax fraud in the acquisition of Hollywood film rights.
