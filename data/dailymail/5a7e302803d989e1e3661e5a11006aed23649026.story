Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz has warned Chelsea they won't achieve success by simply sitting back when the two sides meet at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.

The first leg of the Champions League tie ended 1-1, meaning a goalless draw would be enough to send Jose Mourinho's side through to the next round.

But Luiz, who spent three years in west London before his £50million summer transfer to PSG, said it would be foolish of his old club to invite pressure on themselves considering the strength of the Ligue 1 champions' attacking options.

'I know how Jose (Mourinho) will prepare for this, he will be telling the boys to be patient and hit us on the counter attack,' Luiz told The Mirror.

'He knows that we need to score and that they don't, I know that is his way. We must be careful because I know that Chelsea have the ability to hurt on the counter attack, but they must be careful as well.

'To sit back and just defend against Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), (Edinson) Cavani and (Ezequiel) Lavezzi can also be very dangerous, so it is not just us who have to be careful.'

He added: 'We have players that are used to big occasions, and playing in big stadiums, we know we can do this.'
