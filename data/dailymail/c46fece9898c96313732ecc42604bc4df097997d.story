Michael Schumacher is making such good progress in a Lausanne rehab clinic he may be home before the end of the summer, a Swiss newspaper has claimed.

It has been reported the Formula 1 legend has been improving since he was transferred from a hospital in Grenoble, France, to a unit near his Swiss home.

The news comes at the same time as reports in Croatian media claiming neurosurgeons who have developed a revolutionary microchip implanting technique have been approached to see if they can help.

Michael Schumacher (pictured with his wife Corinna) is making such good progress in a Lausanne rehab clinic he may be home before the end of the summer, a Swiss newspaper has claimed

Schumacher was transferred to the University Hospital Lausanne, in Switzerland, on June 16 to begin rehabilitation

Swiss newspaper SonntagsBlick reported: 'There are signs that Michael will leave the clinic soon and be cared for at home.'

Four months ago it was reported that his devoted wife Corinna and his family had invested heavily in transforming parts of their mansion home in Gland into a medical centre for him, complete with state of the art machines and a separate building for carers to live in.

The newspaper reported that a new building with no outside steps has been constructed on the grounds of the mansion. It is thought that this will be used as the long-term care home for Schumacher.

Some experts say that such home-care for a coma patient is unwise.

But with an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years.

This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.

Schumacher woke up from his medically induced coma last month after smashing his head on rocks while skiing on December 29 in the French Alps. Â

It is understood that he remains paralysed and communicates with his wife and children Gina-Maria, 17, and son Mick, 15, by fluttering his eyes.

Doctors at the Lausanne clinic hope to have Michael sitting upright in an advanced electronic wheelchair that he can control via his mouth within a few weeks.

According to the Croatian media meanwhile, Croatian doctors Darko Chudy and Vedran Deletis, who have developed a revolutionary microchip implanting technique, have been approached to see if they can help.

It is believed that the microchip may be able to help him to walk and talk again after his extended period in a coma.

It has been claimed the family of Schumacher made the initial contact with the two doctors from the Croatian capital Zagreb after reports in specialist publications indicating that their technique had already helped other patients.

The medics reportedly confirmed when questioned that there had been contact but declined to discuss the case in detail.

'We've had a case with Croat schoolboy and he started to walk after two months,' Doctor Darko Chudy confirmed in a short interview with local media.

But he added that he cannot talk about the Schumacher case, other than to confirm that there had been contact and it is believed his technique would be able to help.
