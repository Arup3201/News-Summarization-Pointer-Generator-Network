Richard Rockefeller, great grandson of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller, died today in a small plane crash outside New York City, a family spokesman confirmed today.

The aircraft took off just after 8am on Friday and went down after hitting some trees west of the airfield, according to Westchester County Airport.

Rockefeller, of Falmouth, Maine, was the only person on board the Portland, Maine-registered aircraft.

The 65-year-old was a doctor and leaves his wife Nancy and two children, Clayton and Rebecca.

The plane, a single-engine Piper Meridian,  crashed on a road in the hamlet of Purchase, a community of about 10,000 residents that houses a State University of New York campus.

It
 wasn't immediately known whether the pilot reported any problems before
 going down.

He had taken off in foggy and rainy conditions this 
morning.

Dr Rockefeller had flown from Portland International Jetport in Maine on Thursday to Westchester Airport. The doctor lived in Falmouth, Maine. 

The plane costs an estimated $2.2million and seats six people, including the pilot.

Dr
 Rockefeller had been in New York to have dinner with his father on 
Thursday night to celebrate David Rockefeller's 99th birthday, according
 to family spokesman Fraser Seitel.

Mr Seitel told the Portland Press Herald: 'The
 family is in shock. This was a terrible tragedy. Richard was a 
wonderful cherished son and brother, father, husband and grandfather.

'He
 was an experienced pilot and a respected medical doctor, who most 
recently was working on treating PTSD in veterans. And it’s just 
horribly sad.'

At the time 
of the crash, the weather was foggy and visibility was about a 
quarter-mile, police and airport officials said at a news conference.

Pilots of private planes make the decision about whether to fly in such conditions, officials said.

After narrowly missing the house, the plane hit some pine trees and crashed in a yard. The aircraft broke up into many pieces, which were strewn about the property, with some parts lodged in the trees.

Officials said there was no indication of a mayday or problem.

The airport was closed for a short time after the crash. The Federal Aviation Administration was investigating, and the National Transportation Safety Board was expected to arrive later on Friday.
