Former Blackburn Rovers striker Colin Kazim-Richards has been found guilty of making a homophobic gesture at a match while playing against one of his previous clubs.

The 27-year-old claimed he was bantering with the crowd when he allegedly made a homophobic gesture towards them while playing against Brighton, a court has heard.

But magistrate Darren Reynolds sitting at Brighton Magistrates' Court, told the footballer they accepted the evidence the four prosecution witnesses had given them.

Kazim-Richards said he was being booed and being called names when he turned around and made a rude gesture behind his back to the crowd to join in with their banter, Brighton Magistrates' Court was told.

He said: 'There were certain voices and certain things which stick in your head. There was this one lady who kept on giving me abuse and kept on doing that.'

Simon Reiz, defending the player, asked him if he reacted in any way. Kazim-Richards demonstrated to the magistrates the sign he had made behind his back and told them: 'I was interacting with the fans.

'I was basically doing what they were doing to me. I was having a bit of banter back.'

Prosecutor Simon Allen told the court that the player had mimicked pulling his shorts down, put his left arm behind his bottom and made a homophobic gesture towards the Brighton and Hove Albion crowd.

At one point he was seen by a witness backing into Brighton player Wayne Bridge and simulating a sex act which was deemed to be homophobic, the court was told.

Mr Allen said the Brighton and Hove Albion fans were chanting 'you fat b*****d' and 'you're fat and you know you are' at him.

He said: 'It seems that the player reacted to this and he mimicked pulling down his shorts and with his left hand behind his back mimicked that he had something in his hand and moved it back and forward.'

Mr Allen said that each time he did this the chants from the crowd grew louder.

Christopher Cannon and his son Daryl, who were working as match day press stewards at the Amex, told the court they saw Kazim-Richards make the gesture more than once.

Both men told the court they found it offensive and perceived it to be homophobic.

Mr Cannon junior said: 'I perceived it as a very wrong thing to do, particularly for someone who's involved with the Kick It Out Campaign.

'Racism and homophobia are on the same level.'

Season ticket holder Darren Hastings, who sits in the lower west stand, said he noticed Kazim-Richards make the obscene gesture four or five times during the match.

He said it was his perception that the player was trying to get a reaction from the crowd, and that he was succeeding.

He said he was disappointed that neither the linesman nor the referee reacted to what was going on and said: 'It was utterly disgusting.

'I understand that football players receive a number of gestures or comments from the crowd but I certainly did not expect to see a football player perform that gesture on the pitch.'

But London-born Kazim-Richards, who now plays for Turkish club Bursaspor, said he did not agree with discrimination in 'any shape or form' and told the court he had been an ambassador for the Kick It Out Campaign.

He described himself as a 'flamboyant' player who had interacted with the crowd to 'acknowledge' and 'accept' the banter but that he would never make a homophobic gesture.

Kazim-Richard arguably enjoyed the best spell of his carrer at Sheffield United between 2006 and 2007

Mr Reiz said that hand gestures were made during football matches all the time and that due to Brighton having a large gay community an innocent hand gesture made behind his back had been perceived as being homophobic.

He said that Kazim-Richards 'promoted diversity' and that for him to put that to one side to make a homophobic gesture was 'beyond belief'.

The court also heard from three character witnesses who described Kazim-Richards as polite, approachable and respectful.
