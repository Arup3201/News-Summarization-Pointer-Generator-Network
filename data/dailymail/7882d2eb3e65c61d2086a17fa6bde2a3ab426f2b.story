A rise in interest rates would make 800,000 families ‘mortgage prisoners’ unable to get a new loan on their home, a new report warns today.

The number of households spending more than half of their income paying off debts repayments could also increase from 0.6 million to 1.1 million if rates start to rise, the Resolution Foundation said.

It comes as after Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned household debt is a ‘major risk’ to the economy and could tip Britain back into recession when interest rates rise.

Around 800,000 families could find themselves trapped on poor tracker deals, unable to refinance their mortgage because rate rises have pushed up bills, the Resolution Foundation warned

The Bank of England’s base rate is expected to rise from historic low of just 0.5 per cent within the next year, possibly before the end of 2014.

In a speech yesterday Mr Carney said: ‘The UK economy is starting to head back to normal. As the economy normalises, Bank Rate will need to start to rise.’

But millions of families who took out loans when rates were low could find themselves struggling to make repayments.

The Resolution Foundation said people needed to start planning for the base rate to climb to 3 per cent by 2018, in line with market expectations.

If this happens, the number of 'highly geared' mortgage holders who are spending more than one third of their income on repayments could balloon from 1.1 million currently to 2.3 million by 2018, equating to around one in four households with a mortgage.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney said if rates rise too soon, families will cut back on other spending, plunging the economy back into recession

The Resolution Foundation gave indications of how changes in mortgage rates could impact on repayments.

A rate of 3.2 per cent, which corresponds with current average mortgage rates, means someone with a 25-year mortgage of £150,000 pays £727 a month.

But if this rate increases to 3.7 per cent, the monthly cost is £767, amounting to around £480 a year more. If the rate jumps another percentage point, to 4.7 per cent, the monthly cost is £851 and the mortgage holder pays in the region of £1,488 more a year than they would on a rate of 3.2 per cent.

Moving the mortgage rate up to 5.7 per cent means the mortgage holder pays £939 a month, or around £2,544 a year more than on a rate of 3.2 per cent. 

The report also estimates that around 800,000 'highly geared' borrowers may become mortgage prisoners as interest rates rise.

They will struggle to refinance because they do not comply with tougher rules on applying for mortgages introduced in the wake of the financial crash.

It means they will have no choice but to stay on their existing lender's standard variable rate (SVR), and their monthly bills will rise with every increase in the base rate.

Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation and co-author of the Hangove Cure report, said: 'It would be a serious mistake to think that the legacy of problem debt built up in the pre-crisis years will simply evaporate with a return to economic growth.

'The magnitude of the stock of debt is simply too large, given expectations that income growth will be gradual at best.

'And while the mortgage market largely remains competitive, tighter lending criteria means that some highly-stretched borrowers face limited choices. There is a pressing need for regulation to respond to this new context.'

The think tank warns country needs 'shaking from its complacency' and lenders should be upping efforts to identify and help people who would be put at risk by a rise in interest rates, including those not yet in arrears.

They should be encouraged to undertake a 'financial MoT' and consider how their repayments would go up in the light of different plausible interest rate increases, the report said.

This initiative would be similar to that involving home owners on interest-only mortgages who have been contacted by lenders amid fears that many do not have enough money put aside to pay back their loan when it ends.

Mr Carney yesterday repeated his message that the central bank plans that any rises in interest rates will be ‘gradual and limited’ to cushion the blow for highly-indebted borrowers.

But he warned that if rates rise more quickly than expected it could ‘tip the economy into recession’ because people cut back spending elsewhere to pay their mortgages.

‘It is the prospects for household indebtedness that concern us,’ said Mr Carney.

‘History shows that the British people do everything they can to pay their mortgages. That means cutting back deeply on expenditures when the unexpected happens.

‘If a lot of people are highly indebted, that could tip the economy into recession. Since we start from a vulnerable position we need to be especially careful.’
