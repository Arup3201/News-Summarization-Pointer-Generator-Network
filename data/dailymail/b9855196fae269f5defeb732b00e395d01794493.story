It seems to be a perfectly timed stunt just in time for April Fool's... with a blue-dyed fish dish taking centrestage in this takeaway.

But despite appearances, this Yorkshire chippy is playing it straight. 

Audrey's Fish and Chips in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, is dying their batter a bright blue to mark Tour de Yorkshire's upcoming arrival, which gets under way in the town on 1 May.

The fish is taking a bit of an odd battering by being dyed blue  to mark the start of Tour de Yorkshire's upcoming arrival

The world's top cyclists, including British icon Sir Bradley Wiggins, will be competing and shop proprietor James Morrison hopes he and others will stop by to try their quirky new product.

The blue fish will be served on the day the race begins and Mr Morrison says that, while some may not be convinced, the idea has got the seaside townsfolk talking. 

'I've done a few tasters for customers and posted a few pictures on Facebook. Some have pulled their face but some have said they will give it a go,' he said.

On the chippie's Facebook page, user  Debra Swaryczewska Oliver posted: 'Why would u want blue fish. Doesnt look appetising.'

And another customer Jason Bowers agreed, writing: 'No thank you to blue fish I prefer the traditional way.'

However some customers have encouraged the move.

'I think it looks ace! I'll definitely be trying that,' Savannah Jones wrote. 

Mr Morrison has assured customers that the dye won't affect the taste of the dish. 

'It tastes exactly the same - it still tastes great,' he said. 

'Some people will just have to eat it with their eyes closed.'

'Everbody has been dressing the town in blue and yellow with bunting and blue bikes, so I fancied doing something a bit different,' he said.

'The chips are slightly yellow so I thought about adding some blue food colouring to the batter - something a bit gimmicky.

'It cooked really well. It's not the most appealing looking fish but it's got the town talking.'

The three-day race will be broadcast live on ITV and is a by-product of a highly successful Yorkshire leg of last year's Tour de France.
