This is the hilarious moment a police officer ran straight into a wall after getting distracted as dozens of topless Femen activists sprinted past him. 

He appears to trip over his own feet while trying to stop the feminist protesters running through the streets near the Palace of Justice in Paris.

At least 25 Femen members were arrested today after rallying  against the sentence given to fellow activist Iana Zhdanova for 'exhibitionism' on October 15.

Holding signs reading 'Naked and free' and 'My body, my manifesto' they took to the streets chanting slogans such as 'Feminist not exhibitionist' and 'Not criminals'.

Zhdanova was given a fine of 1,500 euros - £1,182 - by the Parisian court for destroying Russian President Vladimir Putin's wax statue at the Grevin museum in June.

The leader of the topless feminist group, Inna Schevchenko, was among the protesters and she was seen being carried away by police.

Since she was given political asylum in France last year, Shevchenko has masterminded the expansion of the feminist organisation, adding branches in Canada, Germany and Israel. 

The movement, which began in Eastern Europe, is notorious for using nudity to promote their message of female emancipation.

They have staged topless protests at Paris Fashion Week, Germany's Next Top Model and on stage with Vladimir Putin.
