These are the last recorded images of a young man with a mental age of nine who has been stabbed to death by a gang of 'vicious cowards' after getting off a bus to visit a relative.

Police say Dean Mayley, 24, would have had no chance of defending himself against the three or four thugs who set upon him in Greenford, west London at 5.20pm on Friday evening.

The gang attacked 'vulnerable' Mr Mayley for no reason, killing him with a single stab wound to the chest in Ruislip Road around 50 minutes after he was seen getting off an E9 bus on The Broadway nearby.

Last sighting: Dean Mayley was last seen getting off an E9 bus on The Broadway in Greenford. He would usually get off a stop earlier but is believed to have accidentally missed his stop on the day he was murdered

Mr Mayley suffered from learning difficulties related to microcephaly which his family say left him very easily led.

The last sighting of him before the attack was when he waved goodbye to the bus driver after missing his usual stop and getting off on The Broadway instead.

What happened to Mr Mayley in the 50 minutes between the sighting and the attack in Ruislip Road remains a mystery.

After the attack he was taken to St Maryâ€™s Hospital in Paddington where he died later the same evening.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner, of the Metropolitan Policeâ€™s Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'Dean was a vulnerable young man who had 
travelled alone to the Greenford Broadway area to visit a relative.'

'He had made this journey many times before without incident and there was no reason this should have been any different,' he added.

'Sadly that was not the case and Dean was later to die following what appears to have been an unprovoked attack,' Detective Chief Inspector Bonner went on to say.

As yet there have been no arrests and police say their inquiries are continuing.

Mr Mayley's mother Donna, 51, said: 'I hope there is somebody, somewhere, who knows something. I'm begging you, really - I don't know what to do.'

Mrs Mayley said her son was aware of his learning difficulties which meant he struggled with reading and writing. But it also meant he saw the best in everyone and trusted people easily.

She said: 'Dean was very vulnerable and easily led he just wanted to please people all the time. He wanted to be an adult - to be like all the other lads... It took me a long time to be able give him that independence he wanted, bit by bit.

'He was a creature of habit - he knew how to get the bus and took exactly the same route every time. But something went wrong that day and he didn't get off at the usual stop,' she added.

Mrs Mayley said: 'He was very friendly and I'm sure all the shop keepers in Greenford knew who he was. I just hope someone can help us because we will never get closure without knowing what happened.'

'He was vulnerable and didn't know how nasty the world is. Obviously now we know. What has happened to him is evil - but we need to know what happened,' she went on to say.

Mr Mayley was captured on CCTV waving goodbye to the bus driver after getting off the bus at the wrong stop. He was murdered 50 minutes later

Unknown: What happened to Mr Mayley in the 50 minutes between these final CCTV images taken from a bus on The Broadway in Greenford and the knife attack in nearby Ruislip Road remains a mystery

In a bid to attract witnesses to come forward with information, officers have issued a photograph of Mr Mayley in which he is shown hugging his seven year-old nephew Callum. The family described the pair as 'inseparable'.

A postmortem examination to establish 
exactly how Mr Mayley died is yet to be scheduled but formal 
identification took place at the hospital.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Bonner said: 'We know he arrived in The Broadway by bus
 around 16.25hrs and I am keen to piece together his movements between 
then and 17.15hrs when he was assaulted by three or four males further 
along Ruislip Road.'

Scene: Mr Mayley was killed in Ruislip Road (pictured) in Greenford, west London at around 5.20pm on Friday

'That group of males are responsible for the assault and death of a vulnerable man who would have been in no position to defend himself from such an attack... The people who attacked him are simply vicious cowards.'

Detective Chief Inspector Bonner said Mr Mayley's family are distraught by his murder and urged anyone with information to speak to police.

'Think about the devastation this apparently random act of violence has caused,' he added.
