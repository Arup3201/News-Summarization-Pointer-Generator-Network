It's brought stories of some bizarre finds - from the reunion of a boy and his football washed up on a uninhabited island to the discovery of a Harley-Davidson.

And more could be coming thick and fast in the coming months as scientists are now saying the wreckage washed into the sea from the Japanese tsunami will reach North American shores far sooner than previously thought.

The latest computer models estimate that thousands of tonnes of the debris, which now stretches 4,000 nautical miles across the north Pacific, will start washing up this October and continue to do so into late 2013.

Devastation: The earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck Japan in March last year washed nearly five million tonnes of debris, including boats, cars and part of houses and factories into the Pacific

A new satellite image from NASA's Earth observatory shows the marauding mass sprawled across the ocean's surface.

Around 4.8million tonnes - including parts of houses, factories, cars and ships - were pulled into the ocean when the earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck Japan in March last year.

While heavy items sank, at least 1.5million tonnes of lighter material such as buoys, oil drums and furniture were carried off by tides and the wind on a 4,500-mile journey to North America.

Projections made earlier this year by the International Pacific Research Centre (IPRC), in Honolulu, Hawaii, suggested most of the detritus would begin arriving between March 2013 and March 2014.

Must have been a wild ride: This motorbike was also found by Peter Mark on Graham Island, western Canada

Journey: The container holding the items travelled 5,000km from Miyagi prefecture in Japan where the Tsunami struck all the way to the coasts of B.C.

But predictions from the Japanese 
government and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) has now pushed that date forward to October this year, according 
to a report in The Guardian. Indeed, many lighter objects began reaching land as early as last November.

Last month, a Japanese teenager who lost his home in last year's devastating tsunami spoke of his delight after his football washed up on a remote Alaskan beach 3,500 miles from Japan.

Misaki Murakami, 16, came forward to reveal that he was the owner of the ball discovered by American radar technician David Baxter on Middleton Island.

Mr Baxter, who also found a volleyball while out beachcombing, now plans to travel with his wife Yumi across the Pacific to return the ball.

And yesterday, the Japanese owner of a 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle said its discovery on a remote beach on the 
West Coast of British Columbia last week was a miracle.

The owner, Ikuo Yokoyama, a 29-year-old resident of the town of Yamamoto, in Miyagi Prefecture, was tracked down by a Harley-Davidson representative in Japan who saw the story, first reported by CBC News, the broadcaster reported today.

Peter Mark, was combing the beach on Haida Gwaii islands when he made the discovery.

A clearer picture of the debris is not expected to emerge before June or July when two privately-funded expeditions are due to travel into the north Pacific.

Washington state officials, which last week released posters advising residents what may arrive on their beaches, say it is highly unlikely any human remains will be found.

Washington, Oregon, British Columbia and Alaska will get much of it, while most of California will be protected by currents pushing objects back out to sea, according to The Guardian. Hawaii, however, is in line for several deposits.

The US navy and coastguard will be monitoring the debris over fears it could pose a danger to shipping.

But for anyone worried that they may wake one day to a tsunami of trash heading towards them, Jan Hafner, of the IPRC, has these words of reassurances.

'Most people probably think there is a huge pile of debris moving across the ocean like a carpet. But it is very sparse, very patchy.'
