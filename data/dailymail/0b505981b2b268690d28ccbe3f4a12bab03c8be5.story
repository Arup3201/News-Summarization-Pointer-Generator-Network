The Ohio State marching band has honored the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address in an impressive spectacle.

The band took to the pitch at the last game of the season, creating formations such as marching Union and Confederate armies, firing cannons and 1863, the year Lincoln made one of the best-known speeches in American history.

The marching band is famous for its impressive routines which it performs every week at the football half time such as a battleship sinking another and a Michael Jackson moonwalk.

Nicknamed ‘the best damn band in the land,’ the group performed despite the snow at the football match against Indiana on Saturday in which Ohio State won 42-14 to continue the school’s winning streak of 23 games and secured a spot in the Big Ten championship game.

The inspirational and famously short Gettysburg Address was praised for reinvigorating national ideals of freedom, liberty and justice amid a Civil War that had torn the country into pieces.

In the July 1863 battle, considered the turning point of the war, federal forces fought back a Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania. 

Lincoln's speech was delivered more than four months later, at the dedication of a national cemetery to bury the battle's casualties.

In the short oration, he spoke of how democracy itself rested upon 'the proposition that all men are created equal,' a profound and politically risky statement for the time. 

Slavery and the doctrine of states' rights would not hold in the 'more perfect union' of Lincoln's vision.
