A single mother who comfort ate when her confidence 'hit rock bottom' after she had a baby has turned her life around and dropped four dress sizes.

At 5ft 3in tall, Maria Bacon, 30, from Dublin, had always been a petite size 10. But after she had her son six years ago, she suffered from post-natal depression.

As a single mother caring for her baby, she began to feel isolated and alone and her unhappiness led to her comfort eating and neglecting her appearance.

Used to hide under baggy clothes: Maria gained three-and-a-half-stone after becoming a mother, left, but is now feeling confident again after slimming to a dress size 12, right

She didn't have time to cook so she would often skip breakfast and lunch and 
snack on unhealthy treats of crisps and chocolate instead, and then have a takeaway for dinner.

She said: 'Before my son was born I 
was a size 10 and had lots of confidence and friends, but after having 
my son I piled on the weight and my confidence hit rock bottom.

'I always ate at the 
wrong times and I never had three meals a day because I'd be eating 
rubbish through the day and night and never felt full. I hated the way I
 looked and had no belief in myself. I couldn't even look in the mirror.'

Maria's weight increased to 13st 7lbs, dress size 20, and she wore baggy clothes to try and conceal her fuller figure.

As her son grew older and became more active, her larger size meant she struggled to play with him which made her feel even worse about herself.

'I 
couldn't keep up with my son, he always wanted to run around, but after 
half an hour I was done and left feeling bad that I had disappointed him
 by not playing longer,' she explained.

Her weight gain also meant she didn't have the confidence to go on dates and she became more withdrawn and unsociable.

Flabby to fit: The single mother plucked up the courage to start exercising - and found it gave her more energy, left, so she's now lost 3st, right

She said: 'I tried to hide my feelings from my 
family and friends, but they all knew that over the years I had changed.
 I no longer dressed well and hid my body in comfy, loose tracksuits, 
hoping to go unnoticed.

'I hated shopping - none of the fancy shops ever 
had my size, so I mainly always wore tracksuits. But I couldn't hide 
from my family, my sister and I are very close and she knew how unhappy I
 really was.'

Maria's family encouraged her to go on a diet but she said: 'I tried loads of diets over the
 years but nothing worked. It's not like I didn't want to try and lose 
the weight, it's just they didn't work. Each time I tried and failed I 
felt more miserable.'

She added that she also felt exercise was unachievable. She said: 'It was a vicious circle. I had no energy
 to exercise and so my weight carried on going up and my energy levels 
plummeted. I felt drained all the time.'

Active: Her weight increased after she had her son and she wanted to slim down so she had more energy to play with him

Maria then tried the Vi Challenge and found their 90 day diet and fitness plan was one she could finally stick to.

She set her target weight at 10st - what she had weighed before becoming a mother - and has almost achieved that target as she now weighs 10st 7Ib, a dress size 12.

Now she's 3st lighter, she said she feels like her former self again. After taking up exercise, she now has more energy for motherhood and has re-gained the confidence to get back on the dating scene.

She said: 'I'm so happy. I look much better and I'm full of energy so now not only can I go up the stairs without losing my breath, but I'm actually going to the gym too. Something I never thought was possible. I'm like a new women, I've lost weight and gained back my confidence I'm even considering dating again.

'I'm now able to take my son to the park and chase around after him now, we can go on walks or I'll walk along with him whilst he's on his bike.Â 

I bought a dress two years ago and I could never get it over my shoulders, but at Christmas I put it on and my son said that I looked like an angel, I couldn't stop smiling.'
