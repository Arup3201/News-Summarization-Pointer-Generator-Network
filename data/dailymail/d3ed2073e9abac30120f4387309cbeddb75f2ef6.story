A daredevil has taken 'roasting on an open fire' to a whole new level - heating up his marshmallows over a volcano.

Brave Bradley Ambrose filmed colleague Simon Turner as the two descended towards a lava lake inside Marcum Crater in Ambrym, Vanuatu.

Simon, from Christchurch, New Zealand, wanted to make the trip more memorable so brought a bottle of beer and some marshmallows to roast.

He used a spare tent peg which he took with him on the 1,312ft (400m) deep descent towards the lava lake, where temperatures reached more than 1,100 degrees.

A seasoned volcano expert, Bradley has made the descent towards the lava lake 12 times in the past - almost three miles of rappelling.

Bradley, who shot the footage with a point-and-shoot camera, revealed droplets of lava spat from the lake, known as lapilli, have destroyed camera equipment and even burnt him in the past.

He said: 'It ended up being one of the most perfectly-cooked marshmallows I have ever tasted.

'Perfect and crusty on the outside without being burned - it had just the right amount of a gooey centre but without getting it all over your fingers.

'We dangled the marshmallow out over the lake where the radiant heat was at its hottest, so it didn't take too long to cook.'

After 400m of rappelling, Turner decided to pitch up by the boiling crater and sink a beer

But it was hungry work, and with a beer on the go, what better addition than a toasted marshmallow
