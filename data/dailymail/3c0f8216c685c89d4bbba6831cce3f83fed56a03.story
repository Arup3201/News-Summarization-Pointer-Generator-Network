For Dave Lacey, it seemed like he lost his wife, Erica, twice: first when she succumbed to a rare form of cancer at the age of 30, and then when a camera containing her final photos was stolen by burglars.

The Santa Ana, California, man was devastated when he came home one day in 2012 to find his house ransacked and his valuables gone.

But the young widower did not care about his missing Xbox and other items because the thieves had taken his most prized possession of all - his late wife's Canon camera.

True love: Erica Werdel-Lacey was diagnosed with cancer just weeks before walking down the aisle

The electronic device contained photos from Erica Werdel-Lacey's wake and funeral taken in 2011 shortly after her death.

‘It just didn't seem fair, because after all that we went through, to lose those, it was like a punch in the gut,’ he told CNN.

Mr Lacey was supposed to back up the images on his laptop, but they were too gut-wrenching for him to view at the time, and he was waiting for the right moment to face them.

Erica Werdel-Lacey lost her life to cancer in December 2011, not long after celebrating her 30th birthday with her husband of two years, Dave.

The couple met at work and dated casually before entering a committed relationship in the late 2000s.

Eventually, Erica and Dave got engaged and began planning their wedding, which was shaping out to be a large-scale event with some 200 guests.

Busy with wedding preparations and her career in marketing, Erica at first ignored what she thought to be a pesky cold, but when her symptoms persisted, she heeded her doctor’s advice and underwent a full CT body scan.

Just weeks before the couple were to walk down the aisle, the results of the test came in: Erica had two large tumors in her chest and behind her diaphragm.

The diagnosis was devastating: the 28-year-old bride had an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Adding insult to injury: Dave Lacey thought he will never see those heartbreaking yet priceless images from his beloved wife's wake and funeral after the home invasion - but he was in for a surprise 

Against all odds: Police in Santa Ana, California, were able to track down the Canon camera containing Erica's final photos 

Erica's doctors suggested that she delay the wedding to focus on her treatment, but Erica would not let the illness stop her from marrying her beloved fiance.

In the couple's wedding photos, the dazzling brunette is seen wearing a skin-colored bandage on her left arm concealing a temporary portacath.

In the first year of Dave and Erica’s life together, her cancer seemed to be retreating, but the pitiless disease came back in 2011 with a vengeance, spreading to the newlywed's blood and bone marrow.

Knowing that the end was near, the courageous young woman picked up photography, taking pictures of their dogs and documenting fleeting moments of happiness.

When Erica lost her battle with cancer on December 7, 2011, her and Dave's family and friends came together to say goodbye to the vivacious young woman.

With Erica's old Canon in hand, Dave Lacey snapped hundreds of pictures at her wake and funeral with the intention to eventually preserve them on his laptop.

Then a year later, a pair of burglars broke into the Laceys' home in Santa Ana and raided his shelves, unwittingly picking up the Canon with the 300 priceless pictures from Erica's funeral along with other valuables.

Fortunately for Mr Lacey, he had a tracking app installed on his iPhone, which helped him trace his stolen computer to an apartment in Santa Ana.

Lacey contacted police with that information, and detectives Paul McClaskey and Jerry Verdugo wasted no time driving down to the address, where they discovered the widower’s missing desktop.

The officers arrested David Aguilar and his girlfriend, Monica Molina, on burglary charges in connection to a series of home invasions.

Aguilar was eventually sentenced to 120 days in jail and three years’ probation, while Molina got 30 days in jail.

While searching the burglars’ home, the detectives discovered a stack of pawn shop slips, which allowed them to recover two dozen stolen items - among them a Canon camera with a distinctive hand-stitched shoulder strap.

When Detective McClaskey switched on the device, he found photos chronicling the funeral of a young woman and a somber gathering held at a private house.

‘As I started thumbing through it, it was apparent that it was a camera that was special,’ McClaskey’s partner, Mr Verdugo, recalled.

The photos held no virtually clues to help police identify the owner of the camera, but in one of the snapshots Detective Verdugo noticed a blue house next to a familiar beige wall located on the northeast side of Santa Ana.

Armed with a lead, the partners headed down to the area and began driving around the neighbourhood in search of the blue house depicted in the wake photos, but to no avail.

Just as they were about to call it quits, the detectives ran into a neighbor who told them that one of the nearby homes used to be blue before a renovation, and that it was recently burglarized.

Reunited: Dave Lacey was stunned and overjoyed to get a call from police about his stolen Canon camera containing precious photos of his late wife 

The neighbor also confided in the officers that the owner of the residence in question had lost his young wife to cancer. At that moment, Verdugo and McClaskey knew they had a match.

‘I thought it was a joke at first,’ Dave Lacey said, describing the moment he got a phone call from police. ‘I had given up all thought of recovery.’

When Lacey finally laid eyes on the recovered camera, he immediately recognized his wife's one-of-a-kind hand-made shoulder strap.

When he turned on the device, as if by a miracle all the photos from Erica's funeral were still there.

‘I feel like someone was watching out for me, just to get it back,’ Dave Lacey said.
