Nigella Lawson's French co-star in her new cookery show has spoken of how the pair have become 'very, very, very close'.

TV superchef Ludo Lefebvre described the British cook as 'a great woman' as he spoke about how the pair, who are both judges on new show The Taste, had become friends.

Mr Lefebvre said it 'broke my heart' to see his co-star's ordeal during the trial of her former housekeepers who were cleared of fraud last month.

In an interview with The Times, Mr Lefebvre described how he first saw Miss Lawson on television when he moved to America in 1996, but they met for the first time last year.

The married chef, 42, said: 'We have become very, very, very close - we click right away.'

He went on to say seeing the court appearance 'broke my heart' before adding: 'Have you heard anything like this before? No. Because she is a great woman.'

His wife, lawyer Kristine Lefebvre, went on to say Miss Lawson had described the French chef as 'a very good-looking younger brother'.

Lisa and Francesca Grillo had been accused of spending £685,000 on credit cards given to them by Miss Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi.

The pair were acquitted by a jury even though Francesca, 35, had used her family card to spend £8,000 on designer clothes in a single day.

Their defence, which involved drug allegations against their former boss, was that the TV cook let them spend whatever they liked providing they kept quiet about her cocaine and cannabis use.

The jury also heard Miss Lawson describe her ex-husband as a ‘brilliant but brutal man’ who grabbed her throat out of jealousy when she idly wished for grandchildren, and who she said drove her to drugs with his ‘intimate terrorism’.

Charles Saatchi last week made a statement to the Daily Mail claiming he and Miss Lawson started their relationship while the celebrity chef's first husband John Diamond was still alive.

When she gave evidence in court last month, Miss Lawson said she only 'became involved' with Mr Saatchi after her first husband passed away.

'It would be fair to say that not very long after my first husband died I began to become involved with Mr Saatchi,' she told the jury at Isleworth Crown Court.

However, the 70-year-old millionaire told the Daily Mail in a statement: 'Nigella and I began our relationship during the last six months of her husband John Diamond's life, rather than after his death as she [Nigella] stated in court.

'Looking back at that time, I very deeply regret that this betrayal of John occurred.'

The timing of this 'confession' infuriated Nigella's friends, who described it as a 'wicked attempt to smear her'.

Team Nigella has fiercely denied the claims that she betrayed Mr Diamond by starting a relationship with the advertising tycoon before his death in March 2001.

Miss Lawson and Mr Diamond married in Venice in 1992 and they later had two children together before he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997.
