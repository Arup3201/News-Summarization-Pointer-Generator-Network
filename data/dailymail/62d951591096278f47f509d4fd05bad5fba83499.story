Paul McGinley wants his Team Europe stars to be inspired to Ryder Cup victory by the words of the legendary Bob Torrance.

The home captain, who dropped a minor selection bombshell by floating the idea of dissolving the Rory McIlroy-Graeme McDowell partnership, revealed on Monday that one of the recently-departed Torrance’s favourite quotes had been given pride of place in the European team room at Gleneagles.

McGinley, a former pupil of the coaching great who passed away during this year’s Open Championship, said: ‘It’s just a simple message. It’s the last message they see before they leave the locker room and it’s a quote from Bob Torrance, who unfortunately passed away a couple of months ago, as we all know.

‘He used to say to every player on the range, as we walked to the first tee, he would shake your hand and say: “Happiest days of your lives.” And that’s the quote, that’s the last thing they will see as they leave the locker room.’

The fact that McIlroy and McDowell are involved on opposite sides of a contractual dispute involving McIlroy’s former management company has been repeatedly downplayed by McGinley, who again insisted yesterday that the pair being at loggerheads in court wouldn’t prevent him from pairing the Northern Irishmen together again.

But, alluding to a points tally that belies the general view of the Rory-G Mac axis as a power duo, he said he may have good golfing reasons to break them up.

Speaking about the court case, McGinley said: ‘It’s not an issue and it’s not been an issue for me in terms of Ryder Cup captaincy over the last year, certainly, since these court proceedings started. Both of them have assured me all along that there are no issues and that’s the way I’ve always seen it.

‘Whether they come together or not is another story. Three or four months ago, I had a very strong view that they would have been but, the more I look at their statistics and the more I look at the different value I have with them, I’m thinking there may be a value in not doing it.

‘But if I don’t do it, it certainly won’t be because of any issues. As both of them have said, there are no issues between them and both of them will be happy to play together but it will be my decision ultimately.

‘I’ve got lots of options with them. But if I don’t decide to play them, it would be for tactical reasons. It won’t be for any other reasons.

‘They have played six Ryder Cup matches and they have only won two together. It’s not like these guys are written in stone. They are not a formidable fourball pairing that’s unbeatable.

‘Having said that, there’s no reason why they wouldn’t play together. When I was captain of the Seve Trophy I had them paired together and they played very well in that. So I’ve got lots of options with them - but it doesn’t have to be that they have to be together.’
