Police are believed to be 'closing in' on the drug dealer who sold Peaches Geldof the heroin that killed her

Police are 'closing in' on the drug dealer who sold Peaches Geldof the heroin that killed her, it has emerged.

It is believed officers have identified a 'handful' of suspects who could have sold her the drug. 

Peaches was found dead in her home in April by her 23-year-old husband, musician Thomas Cohen.

Returning from a weekend away, he found her slumped on a bed, her lifeless body covered in needle marks.

The couple’s son, Phaedra, who she had been looking after, was also in the house.

Next to the mother-of-two’s body was a sweet box containing a used syringe, with a pair of knotted tights, apparently used as a tourniquet, her inquest last week heard.

Mr Cohen told the hearing that the young mother, who had been battling to stay clean from drugs, had relapsed in February and was hiding heroin in the loft.

Heroin supplies found in the house by police were 61 per cent pure, more than twice the level of purity of commonly traded street heroin which was worth about up to £550.

Tragically, just a few hours before her death, Peaches had posted a picture of herself and her mother on Instagram, with the caption: ‘Me and my mum.’

The TV presenter died of a heroin overdose when Peaches was 11. Her youngster daughter Tiger Lily was at her side when Miss Yates was found.

It is believed officers are now preparing to arrest suspects they believe gave Peaches the heroin - possibly in the London and south of England area - and raid their homes for evidence.

A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'The astonishingly high purity levels of the drug are a major concern and mean that somebody is selling heroin at a strength that is well capable of killing again.

'They have to be found and they have to be stopped.'

According to reports last week, her husband Thomas Cohen has not returned to the £1million country home they shared in Wrotham, Kent, because he has been left so traumatised by her death.

The inquest into her death this week heard how Mr Cohen, 24, found his wife slumped dead on a bed with puncture marks and 79 syringes and burnt spoons were scattered in their home.

She had been looking after their baby son Phaedra, who was left alone for up to 17 hours.

Mr Cohen gave evidence last Wednesday at the inquest into the 25-year-old's death.

North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch said the television presenter, model and journalist had been trying to wean herself off drugs and was clean five months before she died.

She had been prescribed the heroin substitute methadone to cure her addiction. 

Mr Cohen, who was the singer in the band S.C.U.M., paid tribute to his wife of 19 months after she died.

He said: 'My beloved wife Peaches was adored by myself and her two sons Astala and Phaedra and I shall bring them up with their mother in their hearts everyday.

'We shall love her forever.'

Meanwhile, the sisters of Peaches have stepped in to help raise her two sons.

Pixie, 23, Tiger Lily, 17, and Fifi Trixibelle, 31, are rallying around Peaches' husband and spending as much time as they can with their nephews.

A family friend told the Sunday People: 'It's really impressive how the sisters have taken on the roll of caring for the boys. Peaches would be so proud.'

The boys are living with Mr Cohen's parents Sue and Keith in Eltham, south-east London, but Peaches' sisters are regular visitors who often take them out, read them stories or watch programmes with them.

Kent Police and the National Crime Association are working together to investigate Peaches' death.

A spokeswoman for Kent Police said there had been no update but that it would not be able to comment about the progress of an investigation, operation or case.
