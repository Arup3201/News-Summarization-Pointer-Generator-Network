Darius Boyd has opened up about his troubled past and his battle with depression after spending three weeks in a mental health facility

Darius Boyd has opened up about his troubled past and revealed he will attempt to contact the father he never met and the mother who abandoned him, after spending three weeks in a mental health facility.

The Newcastle Knights star admitted himself into a Sydney facility on July 23 due to suffering from depression, which escalated to the point where he would not leave his own home, according to the Daily Telegraph.

'I don't adjust too well to things and there's also an unhappiness with my past and my childhood,' Boyd told the Daily Telegraph.

'Over time I've lost trust in people which has pushed me to say and do things, which haven't been great.'

His admission came less than a week after reports that he'd trashed a hotel room in the Hunter Valley, causing $1,500 worth of damage  while staying with a female companion believed to be his wife, which he later apologised and payed for.

The 27-year-old noted that football had become his only focus in life, revealing that he neglected his family and friends: an attitude which may have led to his wife Kayla (pictured) temporarily leaving him

The 27-year-old noted that football had become his only focus in life, revealing that he neglected his family and friends: an attitude which may have led to his wife Kayla leaving him just before he admitted himself into the facility.

As part of his battle against depression, Boyd confirmed that he would not appear on the field for the rest of the NRL season in a bid to find a happy life outside of the sport.

'I just want to be open, a happier person. I want to smile,' he told the Daily Telegraph, adding that he would focus on making his family and friends the centre of his attention as he attempted to learn more about himself.

The fullback also revealed what he claims is the source of his anger and depression, including his trust issues.

Boyd revealed that his former teammate Alex McKinnon's spinal injury  helped tip his mental state over the edge, as he was  unable to cope with his close friend's accident

At 15-years-old, the football star said he was abandoned by his mother and placed into the care of his grandmother.

He also revealed that eight weeks ago, he received an unexpected letter from the father he had never met or heard from, accompanied by a photograph of three girls who the letter said could possibly be his sisters.

The rehabilitation program, which involved group therapy sessions, yoga and meditation, have inspired Boyd to seek closure on his past and move forward with his life by making contact with his mother and finding his father.

He is also said to be working alongside his wife to help improve their relationship.

His admission came less than a week after reports that he'd trashed a hotel room in the Hunter Valley, causing $1,500 worth of damage

The resort's general manager Joe Spagnolo said the incident had not been reported to authorities because Boyd rang to apologise and offered to pay for the damage

Boyd also revealed that  his former teammate Alex McKinnon's spinal injury, also helped tip his mental state over the edge.

The duo had been close friends for some time and Boyd said he was simply unable to cope with McKinnon’s accident.

The Knights have said in a statement that Boyd is yet to make a decision on where he will play next year, however he is tipped to follow his coach yet again back to the Broncos next season.
