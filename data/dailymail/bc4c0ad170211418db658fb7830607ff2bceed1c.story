People who live in the countryside are better educated and more likely to have a job, according to an official analysis.

Middle England as it used to be lives on in rural areas, the figures show, with more married families and people who say they are Christians than in the towns and cities.

There are fewer people in the countryside who have never passed a school or college exam, and rural dwellers are also more likely to hold a university degree, at almost 30 per cent compared with 26 per cent.

That advantage translates into the world of work, with 64 per cent in the country in employment, compared with 61 per cent in urban areas.

The gap between cities and the countryside is revealed in figures from the 2011 national census, published yesterday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The figures, which cover England and Wales, show that more than ten million people live in country districts, or some 18.5 per cent of the population. Their average age is 45 – older than the average of 37 in cities.

Rural people are more likely to be 
married, with almost four in ten homes headed by a married couple, 
compared with fewer than a third in towns.

Christianity
 is still the bedrock of rural belief, with more than two-thirds of the 
countryside population – 66.9 per cent – considering themselves 
Christians. Only 1.5 per cent of rural dwellers profess any other faith.

In cities the proportion who are Christian is just 57.6 per cent.

However, Christian affiliation has fallen almost as fast over the past decade in the countryside as in towns and cities.

The fall, from 78.3 per cent of rural dwellers being Christian in 2001 to 66.9 per cent in 2011, suggests the Church of England is losing ground in its shire heartlands.

The data shows that immigration has had a much greater impact in towns than rural areas, despite many migrants working in agriculture.

Just under 95 per cent of people  living in country areas of England and Wales were born in the UK, compared with 85 per cent in towns. The same proportion said they were white British, compared with 77 per cent in towns and cities. The ethnic make-up of rural areas was virtually unchanged in a decade, while the proportion of white British people fell in towns.

The ONS commented: ‘Migrants from Eastern Europe have at times been associated with agricultural work within England and Wales.

‘It is interesting to note, therefore, that only 6.2 per cent of residents born in EU accession countries and living in England and Wales were actually living in rural areas.’
