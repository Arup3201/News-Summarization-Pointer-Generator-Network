A luxury yacht was reduced to a burnt-out husk after its engine overheated and caught fire while it was moored in a marina.

The £100,000, 36ft Jeanneau Sun Odyssey, called Fortyniner, was surrounded by yachts and powerboats worth millions of pounds when it went up in flames at Mercury Yacht Harbour in Hamble, Hampshire.

Firefighters were called but were too late to save the cruising yacht, which exploded when flames reached the onboard gas bottles.

Inferno: Smoke and five-foot flames billow from the £1million Jeanneau 36i yacht as it was moored in Hamble

Thick black smoke choked the air above the marina after the yacht's engine overheated and caught fire

Flames: The fire engulfed the yacht, called Fortyniner, within minutes, destroying its boom and mast

Harbour workers raced to move other vessels moored near the burning yacht, including a £1m Sunseeker

The yacht's mast snapped and toppled into the marina, and the explosion sent boat parts flying into the air as five-metre flames roared through the vessel, which had no-one on board at the time.

Harbour workers fought to control the blaze before racing to move expensive ships moored nearby, including a 70ft Sunseeker powerboat worth £1million.

Dock master Dave Wright said it sounded 'like a bomb going off' as the yacht, which is owned by Hamble School of Yachting, exploded on Monday lunchtime.

And once firefighters had brought the fire under control, they had to pump water out of the gutted boat to prevent it sinking.

The eight-berth yacht is rented out by the Hamble School of Yachting for up to £1,450 a week. On the school's website it is described as 'a cruising yacht built for comfort and designed for those looking for a relaxed way of getting away from it all'.

Similar sailing boats cost upwards of £1million, depending on extras and the quality of finish.

The yachting school principal, Rob Gaffney, said: 'It's quite emotional. We're a small company, and it's much like if your house catches fire; it's soul destroying.'

The blaze was the second yacht fire within four hours in Hamble.  Fire crews had earlier tackled flames onboard a 49ft moored vessel which is thought to have caught fire as a result of an electrical fault.

A Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service 
spokesman said the fire was caused by an engine that overheated. No one 
was on board at the time.
