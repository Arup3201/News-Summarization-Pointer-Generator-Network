As Prince Andrew tries to salvage his scandal-hit reputation in the 'sex slave' case  -  the man who knows all of his pedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein's secrets has died before he could tell all in an upcoming court battle.

Alfredo Rodriguez, who was Epstein's houseman for many years, passed away last week after a six-month battle with cancer, his widow Patricia Dunn told DailyMail.com.

'Of course he knew all about Prince Andrew,' Dunn said on the doorstep of the home she shared with Alfredo in southwest Miami.

'We weren't expecting the case to come back into the news again,' she added.

DailyMail.com revealed that Rodriguez kept a black book of Epstein's contacts — which he referred to as 'The Holy Grail.' or 'Golden Nugget.' The dozens of entries included contact details for A-list names including former President Bill Clinton, Mick Jagger, Donald Trump, Earl Spencer, Barbara Walters, Henry Kissinger and at least three members of the Kennedy clan.

Court papers state that Rodriguez argued that he needed to keep the journal as insurance — as he feared Epstein would make him 'disappear'.

Court papers also reveal that Rodriguez witnessed nude girls whom he believed were underage at the pool area of the home and knew that his former employer was engaging in sexual contact with underage girls and had viewed pornographic images of underage girls on his home computers. 

The sensational case has blown up again following court papers filed by two women last week. In them, Andrew, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz — a key member of O.J. Simpson's legal dream team — and French modeling scout Jean Luc Brunel were accused of taking advantage of the girls when they were under 18. 

Rodriguez kept a detailed 'black book' of dozens of young women that Epstein abused. The houseman was sentenced to 18 months jail — the same term as his boss — in 2011 for failing to hand the journal to prosecutors. Instead he tried to sell it to defense lawyers for $50,000.

The book 'detailed the full scope and the extent of Epstein's involvement with underage girls,' said lawyers.

The book also had extensive contact details for Epstein's celebrity friends who included former President Bill Clinton, actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Rock and Celebrity Apprentice host, property mogul Donald Trump.

Dunn, a real estate agent, told DailyMail.com that she did not personally know the details and had never met any of the men. 'But I heard a lot of stories,' she added.

'It was a terrible case and Alfredo wasn't really involved' she added.

Rodriguez, who was 60, died on December 28 of mesothelioma. On her Facebook page, his Bolivian-born wife wrote in Spanish: 'Though our lives were together for 21 years, the last six months (since I learned of your illness) were a rollercoaster of emotions, feelings and harsh experiences.

'I learned again to love, to appreciate you, to meet you again, and have patience, which is something I did not know and I learned with pleasure.'

Rodriguez took Epstein's book without disclosing it to prosecutors, who claim that if they had known of it at the time of Epstein's court case he would have received a much stiffer sentence.

But rather than the details of what was in the book, it is what Rodriguez witnessed that could have confirmed whether Prince Andrew had indeed abused the teens. Court papers say Rodriguez 'saw numerous underage girls coming into Epstein’s mansion for purported "massages".'

A detailed 2007 account of the Epstein case published in New York magazine claimed one of Rodriguez's duties was to wash sex toys that he would find scattered on the floor of Epstein's many houses.

Never-married Epstein, 61, was a physics and calculus teacher at the private Dalton School in New York in 1976 when he caught the eye of one of his student's fathers who offered him a job as an options trader with the investment bank Bear Stearns.

He later founded his own wealth management company, becoming hugely wealthy in the process. He is said to own the largest private residence in New York along with the private 78-acre Little St. James Island in the Virgin Islands, a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, a huge ranch in New Mexico and properties in London and Paris.

He has helped fund many science research projects and is a firm believer in the power of massage — he gave $100,000 to Ballet Florida to allow dancers to have daily rubdowns.

But his reputation came crashing down in 2007 when the sordid details of his penchant for young girls was laid bare in a sensational court case. In the end he was sentenced to 18 months in jail on a single charge of soliciting an under-age girl for prostitution.

He is now a registered sex offender.

He had known Andrew for years — they vacationed together in Thailand and the prince even stayed at his New York mansion after Epstein had completed 13 months of his 18-month jail sentence.

According to Vanity Fair, Andrew liked Epstein because he taught him how to relax. When the prince was warned by an advisor after the court case that he should distance himself from Epstein, Andrew allegedly screamed: 'Leave me alone. Jeffrey’s my friend. Being loyal to your friends is a virtue. And I’m going to be loyal to him.’ 

The women who recently joined the lawsuit against Epstein were referred to in court papers as Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4. Jane Doe #3, who makes the claims about Prince Andrew, Dershowitz and Brunel, has since been identified as blonde Virginia Roberts, now 30.

The two women joined a lawsuit filed by two other women, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. All four claim they were enticed into giving sexually explicit nude massages to Epstein when they were under age.

Jane Doe #3 — Roberts — says Epstein forced her to have sex with Andrew, Dershowitz and Brunel. She says Epstein knew Andrew through their mutual friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the late crooked publisher Robert Maxwell.

'Perhaps even more important to her role in Epstein's sexual abuse ring, Maxwell had direct connections to other powerful individuals with whom she could connect Epstein,' the suit says.

'For instance, one such powerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York).

'Jane Doe #3 was forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate geographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell's apartment), in New York, and on Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls),' the suit continues.

The papers, prepared by lawyers Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell, also claim Epstein 'trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders.

'Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them,' say the attorneys

'Epstein instructed Jane Doe #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and required Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse. Maxwell facilitated Prince Andrew's acts of sexual abuse by acting as a "madame" for Epstein, thereby assisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual purposes.'

Andrew was photographed with his arm around Roberts in 2001, with Ghislaine Maxwell standing next to them.

Both Andrew and Dershowitz have strenuously denied the allegations and Rodriguez, who went to jail for refusing to hand over a book of Epstein's sexual escapades to prosecutors, could have shed more light on whether the two men were really involved.
