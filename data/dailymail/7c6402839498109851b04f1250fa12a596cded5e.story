A tornado claimed the lives of four people in central New York, including an infant girl and her mother, Tuesday night, while elsewhere in the region a severe storm toppled trees and resulted in the death of a child at summer camp.

In
 Manchester, Maryland, one boy died and eight other children were 
injured when a storm struck the River Valley Ranch camp.

'We
 had a very fast moving storm go through the area with heavy winds and 
rain, and the campers got caught away from their shelter,' Don Fair of 
the Lineboro fire department said.

He said trees fell on nine campers. One was trapped under a tree, and the others suffered minor injuries.

Jon
 Bisset, the director of the Christian camp, said 114 children ages 7 to
 12 were gathered at an outdoor pavilion when the storm suddenly swooped
 in.

The
 counselors were able to shepherd most of the campers to safety in an 
enclosed building about 150 yards away, but several children were 
injured by falling trees, one of them fatally.

'Our
 hearts are sad. Obviously, we're here because we believe in providing a
 wonderful experience for children, and we've been doing it for 62 
years,' said Bisset. 'Nothing like this has happened in our history. It was a freak storm that came up, and unfortunately, this is what has happened.'

In Madison County, central New York, Kimberly Hilliard, 35, her 4-month-old daughter, Paris Newman, and the woman’s aunt, Virginia Warner, 70, were killed when gusting winds blowing at 100mph destroyed their home., reported CNYCentral.com.

Twister: The National Weather Service has confirmed that a tornado destroyed the homes in upstate New York where four people were killed

Officials say Smithfield resident Arnie Allen, 53, also died after his house was picked up and hurled up to 200 yards through the air.

‘It looks like literally a bomb went off in a house, you see devastation everywhere,’ said Governor Andrew Cuomo Wednesday while touring the site. ‘It's what tornadoes do; we've seen those on television. But we don't usually see them in the State of New York.’

The National Weather Service is still in the process of determining how strong the tornado was, but preliminary data show the winds were consistent with an EF2 twister more common in Midwestern states.

‘We don't get tornadoes in New York; anyone will tell you that, right? Well now we do,’ Cuomo said

A spokesman for the Madison County emergency management office said the deaths were reported just after 7pm Tuesday in the hard-hit community of Smithfield, located between Syracuse and Utica.

Madison County Sheriff Allen Riley said in a television interview that the rubble at the Smithfield site was being searched and that neighbors were being interviewed. 

'We got our search dogs out right now looking around,' he said. 'We're just picking up parts of the house to see if anybody is underneath them.'

Riley said he plans to talk more about the storm damage and deaths at a news conference Wednesday morning.

The
 spokesman for the emergency management office said there was widespread
 damage in the towns of Sullivan and Lenox, between Syracuse and Utica.

‘A storm came through here and ripped a couple houses totally apart,’  Riley told Syracuse.com.

Riley said high winds had 'totally disintegrated one home' and moved another off its foundation, causing it to land on another house. He said the homes destroyed included mobile, modular and stick-built homes.

Deputies and firefighters were sifting through the rubble, looking for any trapped victims.

‘Right now we're searching the scene to see if we can locate any people,’ he said. ‘I expect we're going to have multiple fatalities here.’
