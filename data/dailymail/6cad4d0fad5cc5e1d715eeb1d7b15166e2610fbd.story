Rickie Lambert will get his first competitive start for Liverpool against Middlesbrough in Tuesday night's Capital One Cup clash, Brendan Rodgers has confirmed.

Lambert has been restricted to four substituted appearances since signing from Southampton this summer.

But Rodgers, who described the England striker as a 'great technician' confirmed that he will be given a chance to lead the line when Boro travel to Anfield.

Rodgers said Aitor Karanka's side, who won 4-0 against Brentford this weekend, would arrive with confidence, but was confident his side could use the game to bounce back from their poor display against West Ham on Saturday.

'This is an important game for us coming off the back of a disappointing performance,' said Rodgers, who praised strikers Mario Balotelli and Lambert on Monday.

Brendan Rodgers said he has really enjoyed working with Mario Balotelli since he arrived at Liverpool

'I've enjoyed working with Mario so far. If he continues to give everything there will always be an opportunity for him here'

However it will be Lambert who leads the line on Tuesday, in a competition Rodgers says he is keen to progress in. 

The Liverpool boss said his aim this season was to win a trophy, and that he regards the Capital One Cup as a genuine opportunity to achieve that goal.  

Rodgers admitted that gelling new signings like Adam Lallana will take some time after Luis Suarez left
