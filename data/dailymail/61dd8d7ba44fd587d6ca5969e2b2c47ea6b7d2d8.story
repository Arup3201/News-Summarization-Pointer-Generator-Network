The father of one of Ben Kinsella’s killers is suing police for £100,000 after claiming he was kicked in the face during the hunt for the teenager’s murderer.

Michael Alleyne’s son, also Michael, is serving a life sentence for stabbing to death the 16-year-old brother of EastEnders star Brooke Kinsella in 2008, when he was just 18.

Alleyne Jr was one of three men caged after Ben was brutally hacked down in the street outside a north London bar, sparking outrage and leading to an increase in minimum sentences for knife crime.

Now Mr Alleyne Sr, from Islington, says he was kicked in the eye and had his ankle broken when the Metropolitan Police bundled him to the ground after coming to his house looking for his son.

He is suing for an estimated £100,000 in damages for the fractured ankle and eye injury he claims he suffered at the hands of police, as well as post traumatic stress.

Anthony Seys-Llewellyn QC told the High Court that a team of officers forced their way into Mr Alleyne’s home on June 30, 2008, the day after Ben was murdered.

The court heard Mr Alleyne’s dog was 
tazered and sprayed with a fire extinguisher after it barked at officers
and Mr Alleyne was handcuffed on the ground.

London Underground worker Mr Alleyne, who is in his early sixties, says he was then kicked in the face, causing his eye to swell up and eventually close over, and he felt a pain in his ankle as he lay on the floor.

In documents filed at the High Court, he claims he was then paraded before a TV camera outside his home and detained for more than four hours without seeing a doctor.

When he was allowed to go to hospital he was found to have a sub-conjunctival haemorrhage and retinal damage to his eye and a fractured ankle. He says he needed 16 weeks off work and has since suffered nightmares.

His lawyers claim the conduct of the police officers was 'oppressive, humiliating, arbitrary and unconstitutional' and are demanding a six-figure compensation payout for alleged negligence, trespass, false imprisonment and assault.

The Metropolitan Police denies 
liability in the case. Mr Alleyne’s claims that he was kicked whilst 
stricken on the floor are hotly disputed, with officers claiming that he
appeared to be struggling and needed to be restrained as part of the 
murder probe.

They argue that he was not detained during the investigation but was taken to a police station for treatment.

Police lawyers told the High Court Mr Alleyne was lying about officer violence just as he had lied at his son's trial.

Mr Alleyne, 62, was referred to a 
statement he made shortly after the stabbing, in which he said his son 
had gone out on the night of the murder.

But, the court heard, Mr Alleyne later changed his statement to stay his son had stayed at home, an account he maintained when giving evidence at the Old Bailey trial in 2009.

Dijen Basu, for the Metropolitan Police, said the claims that his son stayed in were false and showed that Mr Alleyne was prepared to lie on oath.

Questioning Mr Alleyne, he said: 'I must put it to you that you are being as untruthful today as you were being at the Central Criminal Court.' Mr Alleyne did not answer the question after his lawyer intervened.

Mr Basu added that Mr Alleyne's claim that police changed the first statement about his son's movements showed he was prepared to level false accusations at officers.

'The police officers who will testify at this trial are the brave men and women who deserve part of the credit for bringing Michael Alleyne [Jr] to justice for murder. 

They did not attack the claimant, negligently injure him, falsely imprison him or trespass on his premises', Mr Basu told the court.

'We expect and require police officers to take very great risks with their own safety and health in order to protect the public from people like Michael Alleyne Jr.

'On 30 June, 2008, numerous officers entered the claimant's flat not knowing if they would be attacked by desperate and violent men who had recently killed.

'The work of specialist homicide detectives in the claimant's flat and with the claimant contributed to bringing these men to justice. Thanks to the Metropolitan Police in this case, the public will be free of the risk these men pose until at least 2028.'

The trial continues.
