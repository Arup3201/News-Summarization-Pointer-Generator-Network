Three ski workers were missing tonight and dozens of others injured after fire swept through an Alpine resort hugely popular with British holidaymakers.

A 64-year-old woman was among those badly hurt after she jumped from the sixth floor of a burning tourist hostel in Val d'Isere, in eastern France.

Called ‘Les jardins de la Balme’ (The Gardens of Balme), the residence is used by mainly young workers, many of them from the UK.

All of the missing were last seen on the top floor of the wooden building, but local officials said there was no sign of them.

‘There is no news about the three people - we don't know if they were on the ninth floor or moved,’ said Elizabeth Castellotti, a regional official from Albertville.

Ms Castellotti said there was a ‘chance’ that all had managed to get out before the fire spread. No names or nationalities of victims were immediately available.

Four others were rushed to hospital suffering from the effects of serious smoke inhalation, while there were also victims with minor injuries.

Up to 200 others, including young children, were evacuated from nearby buildings, including a primary school.

Fire ripped through the nine storey building this afternoon after starting on the fifth floor for an unknown reason at around 1pm, said one firefighter. He said the roof was completely destroyed.

Terrified occupants were seen escaping, some of them with just towels around their waists, despite the freezing winter temperatures.

The injured were being transported to hospital in the nearby town of Bourg-Saint-Maurice.

Marc Bauer, the mayor of Val d’Isere, said the building housed around 40 seasonal tourist workers.

‘Our priority is to make she they are rehoused for the rest of the season,’ he said.

Val d’Isere, which hosted the Alpine Skiing World Cup last year, is one of the most popular resorts in Alps and attracts hundreds of thousands of British in both winter and summer.
