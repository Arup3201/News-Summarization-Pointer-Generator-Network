Following the shocking murder of 20 children and seven adults at Sandy 
Hook last week, the debate surrounding gun control laws in the U.S has been reignited.

This week President Obama has promised to bring in reforms while the powerful gun lobbyists the National Rifle Association says the answer is for armed security officers in schools.

In this series of eye-opening pictures, gun-owning Americans pose with their deadly arsenal of weaponry and explain why they feel the need to bear arms.

Protection: Aaron and Brittny, pictured, from Pennsylvania got their guns for protection

It's my right: 'As an American I believe it
 is my natural right to own a firearm,' said Michael from Florida, right

No genocide: Ry, from Washington state said: 'I own a gun because a disarmed populace 
is required for genocide and should it come around again I’m not going  
to be that guy.

Home protection: Avery, Miles, Gregg and Theresa, pictured, from Arizona have four rifles to protect themselves against a burglar

The Sandy Hook massacre was the second-deadliest US shooting of all-time after the Virginia Tech college attack in 2007.

Adam Lanza, 20, shot his mother before driving to the school and carrying out the atrocity.

The right to bear arms is enshrined in the Second Amendment of the American constitution and gun control laws have been fiercely opposed.

Daughter of a cop: Danielle, from Pennsylvania says her father was a Philadelphia police 
officer for more than 30 years. 'Growing up the 
daughter of a cop, you learn early on that the world can be a dangerous 
place.'

Safe: Jennifer, Chris and Daniel, from Washington. 'Guns keep us 
safe, or make us feel safe,' Jennifer says

Sick: James, from Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with cancer and found himself in need of protection.

Holocaust: Kevin, from Kentucky says: ‘As a Jewish American I am cognisant of the 
fact that six million of my people were turned into air pollution in the
 Thirties and Forties.'
