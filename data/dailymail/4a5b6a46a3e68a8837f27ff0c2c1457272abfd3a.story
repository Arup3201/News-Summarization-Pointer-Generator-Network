A middle class mother-of-two who claimed welfare benefits in Britain despite having more than £300,000 in a Swiss bank account and sending her children to top fee-paying schools has been told she faces jail.

Caroline Foxley, 58, of Cradley, near Malvern, Worcestershire, who was described as 'greedy' and 'thoroughly dishonest' throughout her trial, has been convicted of falsely claiming benefits between 2007 and 2009.

After the jury found her guilty at Gloucester Crown Court today, the judge bailed her for three weeks for pre-sentence reports and warned her: 'You are in danger of going into custody.'

During the trial, the court heard how Foxley had received £306,000 from the sale of a Cotswolds house in 2007 but deposited the money into a Swiss bank account.

She went on to claim income support and Jobseeker's Allowance from the Department of Work and Pensions, as well as council tax and housing benefits from Cotswold District Council.

Such allowances are available only to people with less than £16,000 in capital assets but she did not declare the house proceeds and said she only had £100 in a Lloyds TSB account.

Foxley claimed she did not regard the £306,000 as her own money and felt it was in a trust for her German ex-partner Dr Kurt Mayer and her two children.

However, her explanation was rejected by the jury of seven men and five women in less than an hour.

Mr Leathley, applying for bail for Foxley, said she had recently been without a permanent address and some places she could stay were no longer available because friends had seen publicity about her case.

He said she had a month's use of a house in Cradley, Malvern, which a potential employer had leased for her, but the offer of the £30,000 job as his housekeeper was later withdrawn because of the publicity.

Judge McGrigor bailed Foxley to the Cradley address on the condition she surrenders her passport and reports once a day to Malvern Police, pending her sentencing on November 13.

Foxley, formerly of Mickleton, Gloucestershire, had denied four charges of dishonestly failing to report a change in her circumstances affecting her entitlement to benefits and dishonestly making false representations to obtain benefits between March 2007 and March 2009.

Stephen Mooney, prosecuting, told the jury at the start of the trial: 'The case involves her making a calm, calculated and rational decision to top up her already quite substantial income by making false claims for benefit.

'It is the prosecution case that this is a thoroughly dishonest woman who decided to get money she knew she was not entitled to in the hope and expectation, and arrogance, that she would not be caught.

'Greedy people bank on not being caught but this was a gamble in respect of which this woman failed.'

Until March 30 2007, Foxley did qualify for benefits but she then sold the house which netted her £306,000.

She used some of the money to pay outstanding fees to three schools attended at different times by her children Freddie and Miranda - Cheltenham Ladies College, Malvern College and Bloxham School in Banbury.

'These are not cheap schools,' Mr Mooney said.

'Between 2007 and 2009 when she was claiming poverty and penury she paid in the region of £48,000 to Bloxham School.

'This was a woman who had certain high expectations and standards for her children and a sense that she was entitled to a particular standard of living and she was going to have it come what may.'

While claiming benefits, she sent her children to private schools including Cheltenham Ladies College (above)

Referring to a £200,000 deposit she made at Habibson's Bank, he said: 'No doubt she was taking advantage of the notorious and well-documented reluctance of the Gnomes of Zurich to give out information about their bank accounts. The money went back to Zurich, spirited away, no doubt, to be used by Foxley.

'What we have here is a woman who has been caught out and frankly she doesn't like being caught out.

'She regards it as rather an affront that those perhaps less clever than her, less sophisticated than her, and less entitled than her, should have the right to pursue her.

'And all this at a time when the poorest in society are having their entitlement to benefits cut from beneath them because of the austerity which affects all of us - but not her.

'This is a case of someone using the benefits system as their own pocket money to help finance an already wealthy lifestyle.'
