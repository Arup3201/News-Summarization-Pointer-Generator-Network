Two men and a woman have died after a car ploughed into a hairdresser's shop late last night.

People living close to the accident in Bradford, West Yorkshire, tried to help the trio who were in the black Mitsubishi Evo; but all three died at the scene.

West Yorkshire Police said the collision happened on Thornton Road as the car was travelling towards the city.

The black Mitsubishi Evo crashed into the stone building near the junction of Thornton Road and Kipping Lane

A spokesman said it left the road close to the junction with Kipping Lane just after 11pm last night and hit the stone building.

He said the driver was a 27-year-old man from Denholme, Keighley, the front seat passenger was a 32-year-old man from Thornton, Bradford and the rear seat passenger was a 19-year-old woman, also from Denholme.

He said: 'Police are appealing for any witnesses to the collision to come forward or anyone seeing the black Mitsubishi driving along Thornton Road or in the nearby area prior to the collision is asked to contact West Yorkshire Police's Major Collision Enquiry Team via: 101.'

People living around the hairdressers's shop, which was closed at the time, said the scene was horrific.

Andy Rushworth told the Bradford Telegraph & Argus that he and his girlfriend tried to help those who were injured.

Mr Rushworth said: 'I was the first to get to them, I was just in the kitchen and I heard it happen and felt the vibrations come through the floor.

'I went outside and saw the car sideways with the bonnet facing Thornton Road.

'My girlfriend came out in her dressing gown, she knows first aid.'

But he said there was nothing they could do to save any of those who died.

No other vehicles were involved in the collision. The shop was damaged and was boarded up today.
