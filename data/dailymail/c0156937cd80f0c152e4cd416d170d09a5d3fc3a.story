Postboxes are so often spotted in our cities and towns that we rarely hail them as feats of craftmanship. But these pictures show the skilled work which goes into creating a British icon.

The classic pillar box has rarely changed in the 160 years since they were introduced as a modern experiment in the channel islands in 1852.

In fact, the most recent alteration to the roadside pillar box has not been in its design, but in its status - post boxes are now private property after last month's sell off of the Royal Mail.

The men and women responsible for
 shaping the country's most familiar roadside fixture work for Machan 
Engineering in Denny, Scotland.Â 

Pride of place: A new pillar box stands proudly on a British street. This year the iconic boxes are 160 years old after being inspired by French and Belgian versions

Famous cast: Pillar post boxes wait to be assembled in the dressing shop of Machan Engineering in Denny, Scotland

Flat pack: As well as making the famous pillar box, Machan also produce wall boxes and lamp boxes, which can be seen laid and ready for assembly, above

Heavy duty: The pillar boxes were designed to be sturdy to prevent them being taken or tampered with. Their narrow slits are also designed to keep out rain

Hands on: Although they are cast to shape, the boxes still need to be 'dressed' by skilled staff at the workshop, here, Dougie Morrison, gets to grips with the base of a box

Machan manufactures all the post boxes for the Royal Mail in the UK, and has done for over twenty years.

They shape the cast iron structures to order, making both the classic pillar box and also wall boxes which are placed into the side of buildings.

The famous receptacles are moulded before being shaped and welded together in the company's workshop just outside Falkirk.

They are then given the famous lick of red paint which makes them the most famous of British street furniture.

Special delivery: Lamp boxes, like the ones being made by Scott  Morrison, above, have to be made specially so they can be attached to fixtures like lamp posts

Seal of approval: The post boxes of Royal Mail bear the mark of the monarch reigning at the time of manufacture. Here, Elizabeth Regina II refers to the Queen

Production line: Machan Engineering have been the sole maker of the Royal Mail post boxes for more than 20 years, they also refurbish old red telephone boxes for BT

Classic: A painter applies the famous red paint to a pillar box. Post boxes were first green, but people complained that they blended in with the countryside

Try again: The Post Office then decided to try painting their boxes a shade of chocolate brown but the added varnish meant the maintenance of boxes was too expensive

The post boxes came into the hands of shareholders earlier this month when Royal Mail was privatized.

Initial share prices of 330p rocketed 
after the sell off, their current worth is 540p. That steep rise led to 
criticism of the government for selling the historic mail service too 
cheaply.

Post boxes were 
first places on our streets after the famous novelist Anthony Trollope, 
who once worked as a Surveyor's Clerk at the Post Office, suggested to 
his bosses that Britain needed fixtures similar to those he had seen on 
French and Belgian streets.

In
 1952, the state owned service agreed to trail three cast-iron pillar 
boxes on Jersey. Later that year a further four were introduced on 
Guernsey.

Scarlet solution: In 1874, it was finally agreed that all post boxes in Britain should be painted red. It would be another 10 years before the repainting project was finished

Work in progress: The boxes are stood on batons to keep them from sticking to the factory floor as painters work their way through a batch

Old hand: Experienced craftsman Pail Ainslie paints the last few spots of a post box by hand at the factory, which is just outside Falkirk

Work in progress: The first undercoat applied to the boxes makes them look a shade of pink. Hard wearing red paint is added later to minimise the need for touching up

Drying time: The iron shapes are stood up to dry in great lines of red at the factory. They will eventually be shipped off to destinations all over the country

The first trial was considered a 
success and boxes began appearing on the British mainland from 1853, but
 it was not for another five years that a standard design began to 
emerge with local authorities agreeing on the most practical shape for 
ease of use and keeping out rain.

Post boxes got their famous colour after a certain amount of trial and error.

The
 earliest boxes were green so as not to be an eyesore in the landscape, 
but they were so effective that the Post Office was flooded with 
complaints from people who could not find their local drop off point.

Inside job: All parts of the pillar boxes have to be treated, as above, to prevent letters which have been posted being effected by oxidisation

Hung up: Lamp letter boxes like the ones seen above are common in country villages were they are suspended from utility poles or lamp posts

The next incarnation of the boxes were
 chocolate brown, but these were more expensive to upkeep so, 
eventually, in 1874, it was agreed that the standard colour of the 
postbox should be red.

There
 are few exceptions to the famous colouring. Most recently in 2012, it 
was agreed that the local postboxes of victorious British athletes at 
London 2012 would have their postboxes painted red.

That
 saw the more than 100 pillar boxes across England, Scotland, Northern 
Ireland and Wales turn gold in recognition of Team GB's record breaking 
summer.

Modern technology: Lamp letter boxes first began to appear in London's affluent squares in 1897, much later than their free standing predecessors

Boxed off: Before the post boxes can receive any mail, they have to be sent themselves to their final destination where they will be hung and fitted with collection times

Sign of an icon: Despite the changing nature of the Royal Mail and the Post Office, the traditional red post box exists as a reminder of its great history
