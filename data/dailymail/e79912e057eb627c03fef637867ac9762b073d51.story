Popular films might have you believe there are no consequences to trashing cars, booby-trapping houses and being maimed in a variety of imaginative ways.

But now one law firm has calculated the cost of random acts of God, as well as accidents in popular films such as Home Alone and Jurassic Park.

They revealed the hapless pair from Dumb and Dumber could have claimed almost £17,500 ($29,484) for the tongue iced to the lamppost incident, while burglars Harry and Marv from Home Alone could have racked up a staggering £190,500 ($320,954) in compensation as the result of their injuries at the hands of Kevin, played by Macaulay Culkin in the 1990 family film.

All of these valuations were calculated by a UK firm of solicitors using industry guidelines on damages for injuries, which are used in the real world.

The Chester-based firm, called What’s My Claim Worth, produced the lighthearted piece to highlight all the different types of injuries that people could potentially claim for - although excuses such as ‘a dinosaur stamped on my car’ will not convince anyone.

The solicitors worked out that Harry and Marv would be able to claim up to £7,500 ($12,636) for their first degree burns they suffered at the hands of young Kevin's blow torch, and £60,000 ($101,088) when they were electrocuted as a result of the young prankster's handy work with the electrics.

Ouch! The solicitors worked out that Harry and Marv (pictured) would be able to claim up to £7,500 for the first degree burns they suffered at the hands of young Kevin's blow torch and £60,000 when they were electrocuted in the film Home Alone

In Superbad, Seth was hit by a car twice and could have been £27,500 ($46,332)
richer for it, while in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Verruca Salt 
could have claimed £2,600 ($4,380) for being forced down a rubbish chute and 
almost incinerated - not to mention trauma from squirrels.

We suspect a little bit of creative accounting may have been involved.

The lawyers calculated there were at least £18,225 ($30,705) worth of personal claims to be made in the film The Hangover, not taking into account the price of a trashed hotel suite and the ruined 1965 Mercedes.

Smile! The lawyers calculated there were at least £18,225 worth of personal claims to be made in the film The Hangover, including the loss of teeth

They estimated that being attacked by a tiger and having lacerations to the neck could net £9,000 ($15,163) while being punched in the face, by Mike Tyson, could allow someone to claim £2,600 ($4,380).

Even more fanciful estimates include £72,000 ($121,305) for Luke Skywalker after losing his hand in a battle with his father, Darth Vader in Star Wars, a shock from the electric fence in Jurassic Park and damage resulting from the destructive stampede of 'Marshmallow man' in Ghostbusters.

That money could come in handy! Even more fanciful estimates include £72,000 for Luke Skywalker after losing his hand in a battle with his father, Darth Vader in Star Wars and a shock from the electric fence in Jurassic Park

Sweet! Among the more unusual film claims is damages for the carnage caused by marshmallow man who goes on the rampage in new York City in the 1980s classic film, Ghostbusters
