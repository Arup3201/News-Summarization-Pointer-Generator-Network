These images show the joyful school days of former pupils at the Army Public School in Pakistan, where Taliban militants slaughtered 132 innocent children on Tuesday.

In pictures obtained by the Mail Online, pupils can be seen happily smiling into the camera on a trip to the mountains, competing in a school sports day and learning in the library.

They come from the school yearbook of Asad Liaqat, now a PhD student at America's esteemed Harvard University, who credits the school with giving him  the solid early education he required to move forward.

After witnessing Tuesday's Taliban attack on his Alma mater, he wrote that he was left with nothing but questions about the atrocity which saw 132 innocent children and nine teachers viciously slain.

'Is there someone else left to blame, before we finally turn on ourselves,' he asked in a moving article, originally posted on a DAWN.com. 'Does it end where we begin or does it extend to within our souls?' 

It is a far cry from the happy days he spent in class 7E, where one 'library lesson' now takes on particular poignancy for him. 

After walking up a flight of stairs, through wood-paneled doors into a 'library that was too dark and cold,' he recalled sitting back in a comfortable chair and reading book, the name of which is long forgotten. 

With the 'forbidding librarian' looking on, he was drawn into the story about a soldier trying to escape from enemy territory back into his own. 

'It was deathly cold,' Liaqat said. 'But the soldier could not ask for shelter. Instead, when he got tired, he would lie on the ground and will himself to believe that it was warm.

'It worked for him. Even in the crippling cold, he could use the power of his mind to believe it was warm and that it would all be fine.'

Around 13-years later he feared, 'some child would be sitting on that same chair, willing himself to believe that the cold in his attacker's heart would turn to warmth.' 

'Maybe, after getting shot, he would have spent a few moments thinking about the warmth of his mother's embrace,' he said.

Liaqat also recalled the school's auditorium where military spokesman, Major General Asim Bajwa said the attackers began their killing spree by shooting randomly at the students. Over 100 bodies were recovered there after the attack. 

'Reports state that all their moves were calculated,' he said, questioning where the Taliban attackers had entered the room simultaneously or left any of them unguarded. 

There were five exits, four on either side and one at the back, he added. 

'The one at the back would have been the best one for a quick exit,' he explained. 'Run across a few feet of concrete, past the chalking of quotes attributed to Quaid-e-Azam (Pakistan's founder), down a dozen steps, and into the trees.'

Those trees, which he could see from his classroom, were within school walls, but nonetheless provided a handy hiding place, away from his teachers' prying eyes. 

'Sometimes, to skip class, or sometimes in break-time, we would walk into the stretch of what I thought of as woods, lining the back wall of the school,' he said.  

'We would crack silly jokes and look for interesting objects left behind by others as if we were scavenging in a forest,' he added. 'When a member of the staff saw us, we would be summoned back to class.'

Now he hopes those trees provided cover to pupils from the Taliban, but he said that from time to time their hiding place would be cut back or down. 

He also feared that the children's bright green uniforms may have allowed the Taliban militants to spot them but he said: 'Sometimes in the winter months there would be fog.'

He also hoped that the clean up operation will be thorough enough for those who survived.  

'Months from now, when another kid walks into the trees to look for interesting objects left behind by others, will they find a pencil sharpener, a chewed-up pencil, a pack of gum they weren't allowed to chew in class,' he asked.

'Will there be dried blood on these objects? How much care will be taken to remove these traces of blood?'

If he wasn't looking out at the trees, Liaqat could also see a small canal from his beloved classroom, which ran parallel to the main road outside the school. 

'There was a period of one or two weeks when we would see soldiers standing on either side of the canal, knee-deep in mud, clearing out the excess deposits, 'Bhal Safai', they called it,' he said.

'I remember thinking our soldiers must not have a lot else to do if they were clearing out canals,' he added. 'How long will it take them now to clear out the blood and the insides of children strewn all over the school?'

He feared some of those bodies would be found in the canteen, where 'the samosas were usually soggy but there was something wonderful about the chutney that I have not seen replicated elsewhere.' 

It was so good he made his mother try some at a parent, teacher meeting but 'she was not impressed,' telling him it was 'too watery and probably really unhealthy.' 

Those children caught in the canteen by the Taliban 'would probably not have survived,' he said. 'It was too open. There was no place to hide.   

After the bell rung at the end of the day, he said he would past the main administrative block towards the school's car park. 

'I would often encounter some teachers and students praying on straw mats strewn on the grass in front of the senior school block,' he recalled. 'There would be about 10-15 people, and my Islamiat teacher was usually one of them.' 

'His head was always tilted slightly to the left. For him, probably a marker of added involvement and concentration in the prayer. For me, an unnecessary display of piety.

He added: 'I wonder if he still taught at the school. I wonder if he still tilted his head to the left when he prayed. I wonder if the tilt saved his life today. I wonder if the lack of a tilt cost the others on the prayer mats their lives.' 

Eerily, Liaqat would also walk home past a graveyard, adjacent to the school, which some reports have suggested the attackers scaled the wall of to get in. 

'I remember wondering what it would be like to visit the graveyard as someone whose loved one was buried in it,' he said. 

'I do not remember there being a lot of empty space in that graveyard. Thirteen years of urban sprawl have happened since. Will there be enough space for the bodies, small and big? When will we run out of space?' 

While holding the Taliban attackers responsible for the attack, he said: 'When we do go beyond single incidents, we go for neat, comfortable narratives.

'Russian invasion in Afghanistan. American funding of Mujahideen. The Army's games in Afghanistan and Kashmir. Indian infiltration. Saudi money. Poverty. Lack of education. Lack of development. Apathetic politicians. Insensitive middle classes.'

Where do we start and where do we stop, he asked. 

'Perhaps monsters are created because we need a visualisation of the evil that our minds cannot capture,' he said. 'Monsters are useful because they distance blame from ourselves. 

'Monsters are simple, neat and horrific,' he added. 'There is no need for nuance. Evil is useful because if evil exists then good does too, and we embody the good because we define the evil.' 

'Now we will mourn for three days,' he said. 'Then, we will stop mourning. We forget our own 9/11's (there have been too many). How can we expect anyone else to remember?'
