Fears of a violent crackdown in Ukraine were rising last night as riot police prepared to clear protesters from Kiev’s Independence Square.

Opposition leader Vitali Klitschko, the world heavyweight boxing champion, urged women and children to leave the square after riot police and troops blocked surrounding roads.

It comes after a week of protests against President Viktor Yanukovych’s decision not to sign an EU integration pact, preferring closer relations with Russia.

Hundreds of thousands of people flooded central Kiev on Sunday, toppling and attacking the city’s statue of Lenin.

The
 president last night agreed to talks with the pro-European opposition 
groups but Mr Klitschko said they would stay in the square.

Calling
 for the government to resign, he said: ‘The opposition must stay here 
and do everything to stop the police from breaking up a peaceful 
demonstration.’

The boxer, 
one of three opposition leaders, added: ‘We are expecting the break-up 
by police of peaceful demonstrators. If blood is spilled during this 
dispersal, this blood will be on the hands of the person who ordered it –
 Yanukovych.’

Riot police 
yesterday broke up a blockade of key government buildings which had been
 in place for a week.

Masked government agents armed with guns raided 
the party headquarters of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and 
took a computer server.

One 
nationalist politician warned that Russian special services were 
infiltrating protesters  ‘with the aim of organising mass disorder’ – 
giving authorities an excuse for a ruthless crackdown.

However, officers among the riot police insisted: ‘We are here to keep order, we are not going to apply force.’

US
 Vice President Joe Biden expressed ‘deep concern’ about the potential 
for violence in Ukraine during a phone call with Mr Yanukovych. Mr Biden
 urged dialogue with opposition leaders, the White House said.

The EU is due to send its foreign policy chief, Baroness Ashton, to Ukraine today.

Meanwhile a 'top government source' was quoted saying a decision had been taken to storm the square.

'The opposition must stay here and do 
everything to stop the police from breaking up a peaceful 
demonstration,' urged Klitschko, calling for the government to resign. 

'We
 are expecting the break-up by police of peaceful demonstrators. If 
blood is spilled during this dispersal, this blood will be on the hands 
of the person who ordered it ... Yanukovich,' thundered Klitschko.

 riot police broke up a blockade of key government buildings which had 
been in place for a week. Some media offices were raided. 

They
 also stormed the Kiev HQ of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko, 
amid secret services claims that some anti-Yanukovych politicians were 
plotting a coup. 'They are breaking down doors,' said party spokeswoman 
Marina Soroka.

As night fell, there was an uneasy tension amid freezing temperatures and snow showers after huge police reinforcements were moved into the city by Yanukovych's government. 

One nationalist politician warned that Russian special services were infiltrating protest groups 'with the aim of organising mass disorder', so giving the authorities an excuse for a ruthless crackdown. 

'They are already on the territory of Ukraine,' warned Svoboda Party leader Oleh Tiahnybok.

However, officers among the riot police insisted: 'We are here to keep order, we are not going to apply force.'

One special services policeman said referring to Yanukovych: 'We don't want to be here ourselves and are just standing because of this monster. It's just an order. ' 

Even as the authoritarian leader staged a show of force on Kiev's snowy streets, Yanukovych announced that he would sit down with three former Ukrainian presidents in a compromise bid.

The U.S. warned the authoritarian leader against a bloody crackdown, stressing the world was 'watching' while the EU will Tuesday sent foreign policy chief Baroness Catherine  Ashton to Ukraine. 

President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso said he had urged Yanukovych 'not to use force against people who are demonstrating peacefully, to respect fully their freedom.'

He said: 'Those young people in the streets of Ukraine in freezing temperatures are writing the new narrative for Europe.'

Tensions had been mounting all days as hundreds of riot police flooded into Kiev city centre in what anti-protesters feared was a precursor to an imminent brutal crackdown on dissent.

The Ukrainian capital has been brought to a standstill for a third week by rebels angered by President Yanukovych's decision to shelve a treaty with the European Union in order to focus on ties with Moscow. 

Protesters, armed with improvised weapons, had ignored a court order demanding they leave Kiev's city hall.

They set up makeshift barricades in the streets to hold off any advances by security forces.

The protesters have been galvanised after police violently dispersed some of the demonstrators.

Sunday's demonstration by hundreds of 
thousands was the largest since the 2004 pro-democracy Orange Revolution
 protests that annulled Mr Yanukovych's presidential victory due to 
voting fraud.

In a surprise 
move, Mr Yanukovych announced that he would meet three former Ukrainian 
presidents on Tuesday to discuss a way out of the crisis that has 
paralysed the country.

The political stand-off has been aggravated by Ukraine's deteriorating finances.

The economy has been in recession for 
more than a year, and the government is in desperate need of foreign 
funding to avoid a default.

As talks stalled with the International Monetary Fund, Mr Yanukovych has sought a bailout loan from Russia.

Some protesters left the city 
building, fearing a violent police raid, but dozens of more radical 
activists barricaded themselves inside.

They were armed with planks, metal rods and bottles of sunflower oil, hoping to make riot police slip if they advanced.

'We won't let anybody into the building,' said Vasyl Khlopotaruk, one of the organisers. 'But we hope there isn't bloodshed.'

Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk called for calm, telling several thousand protesters on Independence Square that police were ordered not to storm the building but to blockade the protest camp to deplete it of food and other amenities.

'I am turning to all Ukrainians: You must all go to the heart of the Maidan,' he said.

Some activists approached police lines, urging officers to come over to their side and even offering them food.

As tensions mounted, Mr Yanukovych announced he would meet Ukraine's three former presidents to discuss the situation. But at the same time, prosecutors called in several opposition leaders for questioning.

The protests that erupted on 
November 21 have had an anti-Russian bent because Moscow worked hard to 
derail the Ukraine-EU deal, issuing threats of trade consequences if 
Ukraine went through with it.
