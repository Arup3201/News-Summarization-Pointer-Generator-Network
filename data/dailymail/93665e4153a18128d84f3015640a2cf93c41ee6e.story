Probe: Amazon's tax arrangements in Europe are set to be investigated by Brussels

Amazon is to be investigated over claims they were handed a 'sweetheart' deal by Luxembourg to help slash their tax bill for up to a decade.

The European Commission in Brussels will begin a formal probe into allegations the Grand Duchy allowed the online giant to transfer profits through the country at a reduced tax rate.

Investigators will consider whether this amounted to Amazon receiving state subsidies illegally and if they are found to have avoided tax it could face huge bills covering the past ten years.

It is alleged that since 2003 its tax exposure in Luxembourg has been limited to less than one per cent of the company's European income, which amounts to illegal state aid.

The new probe marks an escalation of attempts to stamp out tax avoidance by big companies.

Apple, Starbucks and Fiat are already being investigated by Brussels over claims they have received similar deals.

The European Commission is concerned that authorities in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg respectively gave these companies preferential treatment in breach of EU rules. 

The Commission's investigations are centred around the  practice of spreading or reallocating the parent company's net profit to subsidiaries to help reduce the tax bill.

According to the Financial Times if the charges against Amazon are proven the Commission can ask Luxembourg to recoup the substantial state subsidy from the firm.

The former Prime Minister of Luxembourg Jean-Claude Juncker will take over the presidency of the European Commission in a few weeks, but he was the country's premier during this period.

A previous investigation by Reuters found that accounts filed by 25 Amazon units in six countries in 2012 showed how tax arrangements in Luxembourg  allowed the company to avoid paying more tax in the United States, where the company is based.

Experts have said the small country has helped attract more than 40,000 holding companies and thousands of high-paying jobs for its population of nearly half a million.

Representatives at the European Commission were not immediately available for comment today. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.

Previously it has said it has paid 'all applicable taxes in every jurisdiction that it operates within'.

Luxembourg's Ministry of Finance could not be immediately reached for comment.
