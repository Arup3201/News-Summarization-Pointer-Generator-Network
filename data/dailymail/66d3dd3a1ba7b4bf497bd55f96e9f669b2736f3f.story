Cristiano Ronaldo's son has been making the headlines almost as frequently as his superstar father this week - and all the publicity seems to be going to his head after the four-year-old gatecrashed an interview in a Superman costume.

Real Madrid forward Ronaldo was giving an interview to the official Portugal national team channel having been awarded his third Ballon d'Or on Monday when his son, Cristiano Jnr, showed up dressed as Superman.

The interviewer beckoned Cristiano Jnr across and the youngster appeared, red cape and all, in front of his laughing father.

The Portugal captain then kissed his son on the neck, gave him a hug and let him walk away showing off the 'Superman' logo on the front of his outfit.

Earlier this week Ronaldo, quoted in Cadena SER, said: 'In the future I can see myself presenting the Ballon d'Or to my son.

'I was a little nervous before the ceremony but my son is slowly beginning to understand that there are certain aspects to his father.

'There are times you think about the speech but when it comes to making it you forget things.

'I don't write anything down and prefer to do it naturally. I do get a little nervy when I'm in front of a microphone.' 

Ronaldo scored a staggering 56 goals in 51 appearances for Real as they won four trophies in 2014
