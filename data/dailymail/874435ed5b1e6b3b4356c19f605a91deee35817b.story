Warning: Steve Hart, a recent Unite political director, wrote the key report

Nigel Farage's anti-EU UKIP party has been condemned as ‘pre-fascist’ and ‘xenophobic’ in a secret report by Len McCluskey’s Unite union.

The report accuses Ed Miliband of ‘pandering’ to Right-wingers, calls Ed Balls ‘deeply disappointing’, says Labour is not doing  enough to oppose the Government’s ‘austerity’ spending cuts and ‘prevaricated’ over fighting the so-called ‘bedroom tax.’

It praises ‘brave’ rebel Labour MPs who defied Mr Miliband by voting against new laws to force the unemployed to take jobs.

It is scathing about the Labour leader’s decision to intervene in the row over claims that Unite tried to rig a Parliamentary selection contest in Falkirk, Scotland.

And it reveals how Unite is to spend £10,000 on up to 100 Labour target seats, focusing on union- backed candidates – with the campaigns run by Unite ‘constituency captains’ – to try to gain more influence over Labour policies after the next Election.

The document, seen by The Mail on Sunday, was written by Steve Hart, who has close links with the Labour leadership and was Unite’s political director until he left last month after a power struggle.

Mr Hart is a former aide to Ken Livingstone and the son of the late Judith Hart, a Left-wing Cabinet Minister who served in Labour governments in the 1960s and 1970s. The confidential report, submitted to a meeting of Unite’s political committee, launches a highly provocative attack on UKIP leader Nigel Farage, warning Mr Miliband not to ‘chase’ his party’s votes.

‘The UKIP vote represents a dangerous, populist Right-wing vote which is swayed by anti-immigrant and anti-European rhetoric – and nostalgia for a comfortable world that never really existed,’ it states.

‘These are all the hallmarks of pre-fascist movements – which is not to say that UKIP is fascist, because it isn’t, but to point to the dangers of ignoring them and the issues or attempting to chase them.’

Mr Hart adds: ‘The threat of xenophobic UKIP remains very real – in common with Right-wing populism and indeed fascism, which is growing dangerously across Europe.’

In the strongly-worded section on ‘anti-fascism’, the report deplores the ‘outpouring of racism’ over the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, adding: ‘Far too many, in the thrall of Islamophobia, sought to blame Islam. Yet rightly, no one blames Christianity for Jimmy Savile’s crimes.’

The disclosure of the report comes in the middle of a bitter dispute between Mr Miliband and Unite General Secretary Mr McCluskey over the Falkirk selection battle. The Unite-backed candidate, Karie Murphy, a close friend and ally of Mr McCluskey, was suspended from the Labour Party after claims that the union tried to rig the contest, a claim the union denies.

It prompted Mr Miliband to order major changes in Labour’s links with the unions. Defiantly, the union’s ‘General Election plan’ says that ‘in spite of current frustrations and anger’ in the wake of the Falkirk row, its ‘strategic purpose and direction remain clear’.

It makes no attempt to conceal its lukewarm support for Mr Miliband, stating: ‘The worst Labour government is better than the best Tory government.’

It gives details of Unite plans to run its own campaign ‘cells’ in 100 Labour target seats, which will provide supporters with resources, including clothes.

‘Unite will build a structure based on one Constituency Captain and field organisers. The Constituency 10 will have responsibility for organising 10 contacts with each Unite member in the seat 20 months before the Election.’

The document makes it clear that despite its setback in Falkirk,  it remains determined to get as many pro-Unite Labour candidates as possible, and in secrecy,  if necessary.

‘Our work in selections is a bit like a swan, all that can be seen is indication of support here or there, while below the water, activity is furious.’

It says the activities of Unite’s political department is ‘dominated currently by candidate selection matters’, and it adds: ‘We  have had to park some areas of  work temporarily – selections wait for no one.’
