It was described as one of the most remarkable views any human could hope to see.

Comet ISON, dubbed ‘the comet of the century’, will visit our inner solar system from November to January, with expectations that it could provide spectacular views for the Northern Hemisphere.

The eagerly anticipated comet could be 15 times brighter than the moon, with a massive tail, making it visible even in broad daylight.

But astronomers due to meet this week to discuss observing plans for Comet ISON may not have much to talk about.

They claim the so-called ‘Comet of the Century’ may be fizzling out.

‘The future of comet ISON does not look bright,’ said astronomer Ignacio Ferrin, with the University of Antioquia in Colombia.

Initial data suggested that the comet may prove to be brighter than any 
comet of the last century.

It may also end up being its one and only 
trip to the solar system, as its trajectory may see it plunge into the 
sun in a fiery death.

In July, the ISON was pictured on the opposite side of the Sun at around 378 million miles away from Earth, travelling at over 50,000 miles per hour

Ferrin's calculations, however, show the comet, which is currently moving toward the sun at 16 miles (26 km) per second, has not brightened since mid-January.

That may be because the comet is already out of ice particles in its body, which melt as the comet moves closer to the sun, creating a long, bright tail.

Another theory is that the comet is covered in a layer of silicate dust that snuffs out water vapour and other gases that brighten the comet.

‘Comet ISON has been on a standstill for more than 132 days ... a rather puzzling feat,’ Ferrin said in a paper submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and posted online at the archival site arXiv.org. 

Comet ISON is roughly heading towards the centre of our Solar System. It will pass within one million miles of the Sun's surface on 28th November. At the time of discovery in September 2012, ISON was over 584 million miles from the Sun

The comet, named ISON after the International Scientific Optical Network that made its discovery, was found in September 2012 by two amateur Russian astronomers.

It is due to pass about 724,000 miles (1.2 million km) from the sun on November 28th.

If it survives, that is. At that distance, the comet would reach temperatures of about 4,900 degrees Fahrenheit (2,700 degrees Celsius) - hot enough to melt lead.

It may also be pulled apart by the sun's gravity.

Following its discovery, ISON 
recalled the excitement of Comet Hale-Bopp, which sailed past the Earth 
in 1997, appearing as a static-looking smear in the skies across the 
Northern Hemisphere.

Scientists
 believe the comet hails from the Oort Cloud, a cluster of icy rocks 
that circle the sun about 50,000 times farther away than Earth's orbit.

Any object orbiting the Sun in a closed loop is given a figure known as ‘eccentricity’ of between zero and one. 

If that orbit is in a circular fashion like our own planet’s, its eccentricity will be close to zero. Earth’s eccentricity is around 0.017 which means its orbit is very circular.

Comet ISON’s eccentricity is 1.000003457 – just ‘over’ one. This means that its presence in our solar system is an event that has never happened before and may never happen again. 

If comet ISON survives the encounter, it could take thousands - potentially millions - of years before the comet passes back through the inner solar system.

Comet ISON is roughly heading towards the centre of our Solar System.

It will pass within 1.2 million miles of the Sun’s surface on 28th November.

At the time of discovery in September 2012, ISON was over 584 million miles from the Sun.

Its average speed throughout July will be 55,405mph.

It will continue to accelerate steadily until November when it’ll whip around our Sun at an astonishing 425,000mph.

Early data analysis suggests Comet ISON’s size to be around three miles in diameter.

If
 ISON doesn’t fizzle out, you could expect to see the comet with the 
unaided eye anywhere between the middle of November until the middle of 
January 2014.

Many hope Comet ISON will provide remarkable views later this year

It was predicted to have a massive tail and be seen in broad daylight
