Stock in Lumber Liquidators crashed on Monday after floors the company installed in homes across the US were linked to the cancer-causing chemical formaldehyde.

In a 60 Minutes segment that aired on Sunday, CBS reported that company-installed flooring in at least five states had high levels of formaldehyde.

CBS took 31 samples from Lumber Liquidators' flooring in Virginia, Florida, Texas, Illinois and New York and had them sent to certified labs for testing.

A 60 Minutes report found unsafe levels of cancer-causing agent formaldehyde in Lumber Liquidator floors

The show sent floors from Virginia, Florida, Texas, Illinois and New York to certified labs for testing

The testing revealed that 30 of the 31 samples were not up to California Air Resources Board standards

When the results came back, nearly all of the samples had levels of formaldehyde that exceeded California health and safety standards.

The show used the formaldehyde standards set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) as a measuring stick, the Wall Street Journal reported. 

'Out of the 31 samples of Chinese-made laminate flooring, only one was compliant with formaldehyde emissions standards. Some were more than 13 times over the California limit,' according to CBS. 

The flooring comes from mills in China, according to the report. 

The report sent Lumber Liquidators shares tumbling.

The stock had fallen 24.8 per cent before the market opened Monday and trading was eventually halted.

In a statement, Lumber Liquidators said 'we stand by every single plank of wood and laminate we sell all around the country'.

The company questioned whether the testing method CBS used is part of CARB regulations and reiterated that its wood does live up to California standards.

Lumber Liquidators said: 'Although the CARB regulations only apply in California, we adhere to these standards everywhere we do business. 

'Every manufacturer of fiberboard cores used in our products is certified in accordance with CARB regulations.

'Our laminate floors are completely safe to use as intended.'

The company added additional attacks on its standards are 'driven by a small group of short-selling investors who are working together for the purpose of making money by lowering our stock price'.
