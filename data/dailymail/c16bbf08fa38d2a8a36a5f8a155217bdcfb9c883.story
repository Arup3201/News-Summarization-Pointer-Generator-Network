A 12-year-old girl stabbed 19 times in a murder plot allegedly hatched by two classmates to win favor with a fictional character called Slender Man, has been sent a prestigious Purple Heart medal by an anonymous well-wisher, the victim's family said on Tuesday.

The Purple Heart was recently sent to the 12-year-old girl in an unsigned card that read: 'The Only Heart I Could Find – Be Strong,' the Wisconsin family said in a statement.

'The family has been so touched and moved by this act of kindness that they would like to personally thank the individual, publicly or privately, for the gift and for their sacrifice for our country.'

A picture of the 12-year-old girl who was stabbed 19 times by two classmates last month was released last month. Her identity is protected but the little girl thanked well-wishers. Her family announced today that she had received an anonymous Purple Heart medal

The Purple Heart is awarded to members of the U.S. military who are wounded in battle or posthumously if they are killed in action or die after being wounded in action.

'It does not surprise me that a decorated veteran unselfishly gave this amazingly brave and courageous little girl something from his or her heart,' Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary John Scocos said in a statement.

The Slender Man is a prevalent internet myth that has been a viral sensation since it emerged online in 2009

The girl, who has not been identified, was lured into a park and stabbed 19 times in late May in Waukesha, a western suburb of Milwaukee, by two classmates after a sleepover the night before, according to authorities.

The girl survived the brutal stabbing 
and was able to crawl out of the woods and to safety where a bicyclist 
found her and called 911.

The victim spent six days in the hospital after the attack and is now recovering at home, the family recently said.

Her alleged attackers, Morgan Geyser 
and Anissa Weier, both 12, face up to 60 years in prison if convicted as
 adults of attempted homicide.

They could be incarcerated to age 25 if they are convicted as juveniles under state law.

Weier
 and Geyser told investigators they stabbed the girl to impress 
Slenderman, a tall, fictional bogeyman popular on the Internet that they
 insisted was real, according to a criminal complaint.

Two
 doctors concluded that Geyser was incompetent to stand trial and a 
judge ordered a competency hearing on August 1 at the request of 
prosecutors.
