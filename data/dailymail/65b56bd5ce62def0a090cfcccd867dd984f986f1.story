Accused: Itzcoatl Ocampo, 23, is charged with four counts of murder

The Iraq War veteran would carefully stalk each of his victims from among the thousands of homeless living in Southern California. He would then stab them repeatedly with a knife that could cut through bone, authorities say.

For his fourth and latest victim, they say, Itzcoatl Ocampo selected a homeless man featured in a Los Angeles Times story about a killing spree that terrorised those living on the streets for weeks.

And Ocampo had plans for more, until he was chased down by bystanders Friday night after the fatal stabbing of a 64-year-old homeless man. He was caught with blood on his hands and face, authorities say.

'He was a monster,' Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told reporters at a news conference. 'He was a terrible threat, particularly to the homeless people in our community.'

Ocampo was charged on Tuesday with four counts of murder and special allegations of multiple murders and lying in wait and use of a deadly weapon. Three victims were stabbed more than 40 times each with a single-edged blade at least seven-inches (17.7-centimeters) long.

Authorities declined to say whether they had identified a motive. Rackauckas said he had no indication that Ocampo was mentally ill.

Ocampo's family said the 23-year-old was a troubled man after he returned from Iraq in 2008. Ocampo was being held in isolation at an Orange County jail while officers keep an eye on him 24 hours a day, officials said.

If convicted, Ocampo faces a minimum sentence of life in prison without parole. Authorities have yet to decide whether to seek the death penalty.

Ocampo is due to appear in court 
today, but his attorney said his arraignment would likely be postponed 
since the attorney was not allowed inside the jail to speak with his 
client over the weekend and has met with him only briefly.

Defense attorney Randall Longwith declined to comment on the allegations. He said Ocampo is being held in a mental ward.

'I walked in, he was curled up in a blanket,' Mr Longwith said. 'He looked like a wet puppy dog.'

The killing spree began in December, 
prompting police and advocates to fan out across the county known as the
home to Disneyland and multimillion-dollar beachfront homes to urge the
homeless to sleep in groups or in one of two wintertime shelters.

The victims: (L-R) James 
McGillivray was stabbed outside a shopping centre on December 20; Lloyd 
Middaugh was found stabbed on a riverbed on December 28; and Paulus 
Cornelius Smit was found stabbed outside a library on December 30

Ocampo's arrest Friday was the latest
violent crime involving a veteran. This month, an Iraq War veteran 
fatally shot a ranger at Mount Rainier National Park and died later as 
he fled police across the mountain's snow-covered slopes.

Veterans Affairs officials say such 
high-profile violence can paint an inaccurate picture of returning 
veterans. The cases, however, raise the issue of veterans having a 
difficult time adjusting back into civilian life.

A neighbour who is a Vietnam veteran 
and Ocampo's father both tried to push him to get treatment at a 
Virginia hospital, but he refused. His father, Refugio Ocampo, said his 
son came back from his deployment a changed man. He said his son 
expressed disillusionment and became ever darker as he struggled to find
his way.

After Ocampo was discharged in 2010 
and returned home, his parents separated. The same month, one of his 
friends, a corporal, was killed during combat in Afghanistan. His 
brother said Ocampo visited his friend's grave twice a week.

Like the men Ocampo is accused of 
preying on, his father is homeless. His father lost his job and ended up
living under a bridge before finding shelter in the cab of a 
broken-down big-rig he is helping repair.

Days before his arrest, Ocampo 
visited his father, warning him of the danger of being homeless. He 
showed him a picture of one of the slain men, his father said.

'He was very worried about me,' his father said. 'I told him, "Don't worry. I'm a survivor. Nothing will happen to me."'

Itzcoatl Ocampo followed a friend 
into the Marine Corps right out of high school in 2006. He now lives 
with his mother, uncle, younger brother and sister in a rented house on a
horse ranch surrounded by the sprawling suburbs of Yorba Linda.

His family described a physical 
condition he suffered in which his hands shook and he suffered 
headaches. Medical treatments helped until he started drinking heavily, 
they said.

Worried: Refugio Ocampo, the father of the 23-year-old who is the prime suspect in the killings, is himself homeless and said the Iraq war killed the man his son used to be

As fear spread through the homeless 
community, police last week set up road blockades to seek help from 
members of the public in tracking down a suspect. Ocampo, who appeared 
to relish the media spotlight, passed through the checkpoints twice but 
did not draw attention to himself, Mr Rackauckas said.

Ocampo was arrested Friday night when
witnesses chased him down after John Berry was stabbed to death outside
a fast-food restaurant in Anaheim, about 26 miles (42 kilometers) 
southeast of Los Angeles, authorities said.

A day before he died, Berry had filed
a report with police saying he believed someone was trying to follow 
him. It was one of nearly 600 leads and tips that officers received.

'It is unfortunate that we didn't get to him before the suspect did,' Anaheim Police Chief John Welter said.

In addition to Berry, James Patrick 
McGillivray, 53, was killed near a shopping center in Placentia on 
December 20 and Lloyd Middaugh, 42, was found near a riverbed trail in 
Anaheim on December 28. The third victim, Paulus Smit, 57, was stabbed 
to death outside a library in Yorba Linda on December 30.

Mr Smit became homeless last year 
after his girlfriend's home was shuttered by code enforcement officers 
because of hoarding and clutter. Ever since, the father of three had 
moved between the homes of two of his children and spent some time on 
the streets, his daughter Julia Smit-Lozano said.

Smit-Lozano, who spent the Christmas 
holiday with her father days before he was killed, welcomed the news of 
Ocampo's arrest. 'I'm glad the streets are a little safer for the rest 
of the homeless,' she said.
