When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses a joint session of the U.S. Congress on March 3, an important chair in the House chamber might be empty.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest refused to say on Wednesday whether Vice President Joe Biden would attend. His absence would be conspicuous – not only because he represents President Barack Obama, but also because he officially presides over the U.S. Senate.

'The Vice President's schedule for that week has not yet been set,' Earnest told reporters. 'So as we get some more details worked out of his schedule, we'll be able to let you know whether or not he'll be able to attend that joint session.'

America's Constitution gives vice presidents the role of Senate 'president,' a role that's largely ceremonial but can include casting tie-breaking votes when legislation hits a 50-50 deadlock.

THAT WAS THEN, THIS IS NOW: Vice President Joe Biden greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warmly in 2011 when he addressed a joint session of Congress, but he might not show up this time at all

White House press secretary Josh Earnest won't make any commitments that Biden will be on Capitol Hill in his customary chair when Netanyahu comes on March 3

Biden and House Speaker John Boehner are seen sitting behind Obama each year during his State of the Union address, which takes place in the same forum Netanyahu will enter.

Members of both houses of Congress have gathered in the House chamber 18 times since Obama took office, including those annual presidential speeches.

'The vice president has only missed one,' Earnest said Wednesday. 'He missed one back in March of 2011 when then-Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard spoke before a joint session of Congress.' 

Biden was overseas on visits to Finland, Russia and Moldova at the time. 

Other heads of state have also addressed Congress in the Obama era, including the leaders of the United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea, Mexico, Ukraine.

And Israel, too.

Netanyahu spoke to a joint session of Congress in May 2011, delivering a passionate defense of his country to thunderous applause and 29 standing ovations – four more than Obama had received during that year's State of the Union address.

Biden was among those cheering. But his attendance in March, Earnest said, 'is going to be contingent on his schedule.'

Netanyahu's speech in 2011 was aimed squarely at Obama, a flat rejection of using Israel's 1967 borders as a starting point for a peace deal with the Palestinian Authority. 

'Israel will not return to the indefensible boundaries of 1967,' he declared.

'Israel on the 1967 lines would be only 9 miles wide,' Netanyahu added later. 'So much for defensible borders.'

This time around the israeli prime minister is concerned about the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran, and is preparing another rhetorical cruise missile to lob at the Oval Office.

Obama has fended off threats from members of both parties in Congress to level new sanctions on Tehran as the Islamic republic's mullahs drag negotiatons over their nuclear program to a slow crawl.

House and Senate leaders believe Iran is playing for time while it gears up a weapons program, but Tehran insists it wants to maintain reactors for energy – although Iran sits atop the world's third-largest oil reserves.

The White House, however, insists that tightening the screws now would give Iran a rationale for ending the talks entirely. 

The latest spat unfolding along the length of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. was put on ice when senators agreed to hold off on a new round of sanctions until March 24. 

Netanyahu is a fierce critic of how Obama and his State Department have handled the years-long negotiations. 

Boehner, the Ohio Republican who presides over the House of Representatives, extended his invitation on January 21., decidedly going behind Obama's back and putting the White House in a difficult position.

Earnest announced the next day that Obama wouldn't be meeting with Netanyahu while he was in Washington.

Netanyahu received 29 standing ovations during his 2011 speech – that's four more than Obama got during that year's State of the Union address

'We have a longstanding practice of not meeting with democratically elected officials shortly before their election,' he said, noting that the Israelis will go to the polls on March 17. 

'And the reason for that is we want to avoid even the appearance of any kind of interference with a democratic election.'

Earnest continued to snipe at Republicans on Wednesday, dismissing Boehner's invitation as a 'breach in protocol' that could elevate relations between U.S. Republicans and Israel's Likud Party above America's broader relations with Israel.

He also acknowledged that several senior Democratic lawmakers have openly discussed boycotting the March 3 speech.

'The president believes that individual members ought to decide for themselves,' Earnest said. 'That's certainly appropriate.' 

Several prominent Jewish Democrats including New York Rep. Steve Israel met with Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer on Wednesday, airing their complaints.

TICKED OFF: California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein (right) says having Netanyahu address Congress is 'obviously political'

NO RSVP YET: Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois says he may or may not show up for Bibi's speech

Yuli-Yoel Edelstein, the speaker of Israel's Knesset – its parliament – met separately with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

Israel told the Associated Press that Democrats became furious when Boehner 'decided that Israel would be a political football and he'd spike it in the end zone.'

Others in the meeting included Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, New York Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Nita Lowey, Florida Rep. Ted Deutch, Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who also chairs the Democratic National Committee.

Boehner insists that the House of Representatives is part of a branch of the U.S. government that's co-equal with the White House, and has the right to invite Netanyahu to 'talk to the members of Congress about the serious threat that Iran poses and the serious threat of radical Islam.'

In the Senate, California's Dianne Feinstein is also weighing a boycott.

'My concern is that it's obviously political, and it uses the backdrop of the United States House of Representatives, and the Senate and the House, two weeks before a political campaign, and violates all the protocol that's always existed in terms of working this out with the president,' she told The Washington Post.

Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said he may or may not go: 'I haven't made up my mind.'

Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who along with New Jersey Democrati Sen. Bob Menendez has been pushing for a new sanctions regime on Iran, said empty seats on March 3 would be a disgrace.

'I think that would not be appropriate treatment of the prime minister of Israel, and I'm sure they can respond to their constituents as to why they would do that,' McCain fumed.

Menendez told The Wall Street Journal that he won't miss Netanyahu's speech.

'From my perspective, if he is here, I'll probably be attending,' he said.

Netanyahu has other challenges on his mind with his position at stake in the March 17 election.

His Likud Party has launched an ad mocking rivals Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni as unqualified stewards of Israel's children – while he, the 'Bibisitter,' can take better care of their futures.

The two challengers, known to Israelis as 'Buji and Tzipi,' would trade off prime minister duties if their coalition can drive Likud from power.
