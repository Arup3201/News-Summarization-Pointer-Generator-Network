As the England players  struggle to come to terms with their disastrous World Cup campaign, Wayne Rooney has apologised to the nation for the performances. He has also pledged his support for Roy Hodgson as England manager, and insisted that England need to become less ‘honest’ in their approach to the game.

Speaking in the wake of his team’s elimination, Rooney said. ‘The fans have been incredible to us, flying all this way and giving us the support they have. Back home there were kids staying up late and watching the games. Out here, the fans have been amazing.

‘It’s not the easiest place for them to come, so we appreciate the efforts they have made and we’re sorry for not going through.

‘We’ve given everything. We’ve 
dedicated our lives to this tournament and unfortunately we haven’t 
succeeded. We appreciate everything they’ve done for us. Hopefully, one 
day soon, we’ll give them something to smile about.’

His
 support for Hodgson was unequivocal. ‘Roy is a fantastic manager and 
fantastic person in my eyes, and he’s the right man to take us forward,’
 he said.

‘He’s brought a 
lot of youth and excitement into the team. It hasn’t worked out in this 
tournament, but he’s certainly got his plans set in place in the next 
two years, and we’ll try and execute those plans.

‘If
 you look over the previous two or three tournaments, we’ve not attacked
 teams. We’ve been cautious. This time, we’ve had a go. In other 
tournaments we’ve wondered if we could’ve done things differently once 
we were out, but we’ve had a go here. But it’s not gone our way.

‘Roy’s
 hurting too. Of course he is. We all do really. It’s hard to take. 
There’s no way round it. It’s tough on us, tough on the fans, but it’s 
something we have to try and move on from quickly and put right.’

He
 insisted one of the major lessons learned was for English foot-ball to 
become more street-wise: ‘You look at teams who have won the tournament 
over previous years and you can see that nastiness in them.

'I think we 
need to get that in us. Maybe we’re too honest, I feel, as a team. In 
terms of Uruguay the other night, they stopped the game, they committed I
 don’t know how many fouls ... clever fouls, really, to slow the game 
down.

‘I think we’re a bit
 honest in terms of the way we play. It’s small  margins. But those 
small things can amount to a big thing in terms of staying in or going 
out. If we can learn that quickly and adapt to that, I think we’ll do 
better.

‘You see players 
surrounding the referees — I’m not saying Uruguay did that — but I’m the
 same now. I want to win the game. I got kicked 10 times and I don’t 
think there was a yellow card given to an opponent.

'We try and be 
honest, but maybe that’s a fault of ours. But we gave everything to try 
and win. It hasn’t happened. It’s tough ... we have to stay strong and 
try and improve.’

Gone: England were knocked out of the World Cup after failing to win their first two Group D games

Chance: Rooney's second half goal against Uruguay gave England hope before Luis Suarez scored the winner 

At 28, 
Rooney has played international football for 11 years and speaks with 
the experience of three World Cups.

The outstanding English player of 
his generation, he is aware his remarkable talent has never found 
adequate expression at the highest level. He is also aware that this 
festival in Brazil may well have been his last chance, and he tried to 
conceal his frustration.

‘It’s
 difficult to sit here and say I enjoyed the tournament, because we’re 
out. That’s it. We’re hurting. It’s tough going out of the  tournament 
like that. We have to remember how we feel at this moment and use that 
pain.’

Asked if there was 
consolation in the fact he scored his first World Cup goal against 
Uruguay, Rooney almost snorted: ‘I scored a goal, but we lost, we’re out
 of the tournament. That’s all that matters.

'This team’s much bigger 
than Wayne Rooney. I’m just a part of this team. It’s not through lack 
of trying. We gave our all. We tried, but we didn’t succeed. It’s 
football. It happens.’

It 
was pointed out that Rooney ran more than anyone at this tournament. He 
was not surprised. ‘I believe I’ve got many years left in me. I feel 
good,’ he said.

‘We get 
stats daily from training and games, and I’m always in the top two or 
three. Sometimes it affects decision-making inside the box, being tired 
from doing too much.

'Maybe I should run around a bit less! But playing 
for your country, you want to try and do well and work for the team, 
whether that’s up front, behind the forward or wide.’

Despite his stress on the team ethic, he has solid ambitions of  beating Sir Bobby Charlton’s record of 49 England goals.

‘Of
 course,’ he said. ‘It’s within touching distance. I’ll be disappointed 
if I don’t do it. I feel I’ve many years left. If I don’t get the 10 
goals to beat the record, I’ll have no one to blame but myself. It would
 be a great achievement. But this is about the team. Collectively, we’re
 disappointed. I don’t want to be talking about my chances of breaking 
records when we’re all hurting.’

England
 have four Euro qualifiers before Christmas. Did he believe the 
supporters needed to be patient with the young team’s efforts?

‘We
 have to start well because we want to be in the next tournament,’ he 
said. ‘We just have to do well in those. The fans will see some exciting
 football, but we have to turn that exciting football into results. 
That’s the plan, that’s the aim.

‘Roy
 has moved us forward in my eyes since the previous tournament. I know 
we haven’t progressed from the group, but he’s moved us forward. I know 
it’s tough to say that or believe that now, but I’ve been in this squad 
for over 10 years now and that’s being truthful and honest.’
