Two Catholic midwives who refused to take any part in abortions because it would 'violate their conscience' cannot object to helping with terminations, the UK's highest court ruled today.

Scottish NHS workers Mary Doogan and Connie Wood argued they are entitled to refuse to order, supervise or support staff or patients at any point during the abortion process on religious grounds.

The Catholic Church opposes all abortions, even if the pregnancy is the result of a crime or puts the mother in danger because all life is sacred, including that of an unborn child. 

But the NHS and midwife groups said that the right to object - beyond the midwives' right to refuse to abort the child themselves - compromised care for patients.

Landmark case: Catholic midwives Connie Wood, left, and Mary Doogan, right, demanded the right to refuse any involvement in abortion procedures but the Supreme Court has ruled that this cannot happen

In a seven-year court battle the Scottish midwives were backed by the Court of Session in Edinburgh who agreed they could conscientiously object to taking any part in terminations.

They agreed that the right of conscientious objection 'extends not only to the actual medical or surgical termination but to the whole process of treatment given for that purpose'.

2007 - Catholic midwives Mary Doogan and Connie Wood became concerned at a decision to move all medical abortions to the labour ward at Southern General Hospital, Glasgow.

As labour co-ordinators and midwives they had previously registered their conscientious objection to taking direct part in abortions, as allowed under the Abortion Act.

2012 - Ms Doogan and Ms Wood argued their supervision and support of staff involved directly in terminations amounted to 'participation in treatment' and breached their human rights.

Judge Lady Smith at the Court of Session found the pair were sufficiently removed from any involvement to afford an appropriate respect of their beliefs.

Ms Doogan and Ms Wood appealed the decision.

April 2013 - Edinburgh court's Inner House overturned the decision and allowed the midwives to be completely separated from any part of the process  

November 2014 - Supreme Court  hears an appeal brought by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.

December 2014:  Five judges rule  that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's appeal should stand.

But today five justices at the Supreme Court in London allowed an appeal by a health authority in Scotland against them.

The health board argued that conscientious objection is a right only to refuse to take part in activities that directly bring about the termination of a pregnancy, not the support and care  process.

Lady Hale, Lord Wilson, Lord Reed, Lord Hughes and Lord Hodge unanimously allowed the appeal today. 

The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) and British Pregnancy Advisory Service (bpas) had warned of the implications for services if the Court of Session decision was allowed to stand.

The 'landmark' ruling was welcomed by the RCM and bpas.

In a statement the two bodies said they intervened in the case because they believed 'such a broad and unprecedented interpretation of conscientious objection, applicable across the UK, would effectively have enabled a tiny number of staff opposed to abortion to make women's care undeliverable in many NHS settings'.

Ann Furedi, chief executive of bpas, said: 'We welcome this ruling. Bpas supports the right to refuse to work in abortion care, not least because women deserve better than being treated by those who object to their choice.

'But the law as it stands already provides healthcare workers with these protections. Extending this protection to tasks not directly related to the abortion would be to the detriment of women needing to end a pregnancy and the healthcare staff committed to providing that care.

'There are enough barriers in the way of women who need an abortion without further obstacles being thrown in their way.'

Ruling: It has taken seven years of court fights before the abortion case made it to the Supreme Court in London, pictured, the highest court in the land

Gillian Smith, RCM director for Scotland, said: 'This ruling is sensible and both women and midwives will welcome it.

'The ruling gives extensive definition to complex clinical and other situations, in regard to whether conscientious objection applies or not.

The Abortion Act 1967 allows healthcare professionals to refuse to participate in direct involvement in abortion care, provided it is not an emergency case.

Catholic midwives and labour ward co-ordinators, Mary Doogan and Connie Wood argued their objection should extend to supervising, delegating and support their colleagues who were directly caring for women having had terminations.

The Royal College of Midwives and the NHS argued that  it would set a precedent that could 'compromise patient care'

'Midwives and other clinicians will benefit from this ruling's clarity and women will be able to continue to exercise their choice over their reproductive rights.' 

The case before the justices centred on the scope of the right to conscientious objection under the Abortion Act 1967, which provides that 'no person shall be under any duty ... to participate in any treatment authorised by this Act to which he has a conscientious objection'. 

Last April's appeal victory for the two women followed a ruling against them in 2012 in their action against NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.

In the previous appeal ruling in favour of the women, Lady Dorrian, with Lords Mackay and McEwan, said: 'In our view, the right of conscientious objection extends not only to the actual medical or surgical termination but to the whole process of treatment given for that purpose.'

After that decision, Ms Doogan and Ms Wood said the ruling affirmed the rights of all midwives to withdraw from a practice that would 'violate their conscience'.

The women were employed as labour ward co-ordinators at Southern General Hospital in Glasgow. 

At the time of the original ruling, Ms Doogan had been absent from work due to ill health since March 2010 and Ms Wood had been transferred to other work.

Senior: The women were employed as labour ward co-ordinators at Southern General Hospital in Glasgow

Both registered their conscientious objection to participation in pregnancy terminations years ago, under the Abortion Act, but became concerned when medical terminations were moved to the labour ward in 2007.

They said being called upon to supervise and support staff providing care to women having an abortion would amount to 'participation in treatment' and would breach their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.

In the original ruling against them, the judge, Lady Smith, found that the women were sufficiently removed from involvement in pregnancy terminations to afford them appropriate respect for their beliefs.
