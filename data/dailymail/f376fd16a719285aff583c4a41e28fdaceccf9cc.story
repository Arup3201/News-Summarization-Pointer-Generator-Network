Nasa has revealed an amazing timelapse animation showing the Curiosity rover's parachute blowing in the Martian wind.

The images were obtained by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter as it passed overhead.

Taken between Aug. 12, 2012, and Jan. 13, 2013, they show the used parachute shifting its 
shape on the surface and it is blown about by winds.

The astonishing series of images reveal Curiosity's parachute fluttering in the wind

The parachute is the largest one of 
its kind ever constructed, and measures 65 feet in diameter.

The parachute’s
suspension lines were made from Technora, with a fiber similar to 
Kevlar.

The color is a creamy yellow, which is why they are not visible 
in the images such as those in the Phoenix lander descent image which 
were white.

The photos from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show how the parachute that helped NASA's Curiosity rover land on Mars last summer has subsequently changed its shape on the ground.

The images were obtained by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

Seven images taken by HiRISE between Aug. 12, 2012, and Jan. 13, 2013, show the used parachute shifting its shape at least twice in response to wind.

Sometime between September 8, 2012 
and November 30, 2012, there was a major change in which the parachute 
extension to the southeast (lower right) was moved inward, so the 
parachute covers a smaller area.

In the same time interval some of the 
dark ejecta around the backshell brightened, perhaps from deposition of 
airborne dust.

Another change happened between 
December 16, 2012 and January 13, 2013, when the parachute shifted a bit
to the southeast.

This type of motion may kick off dust and keep 
parachutes on the surface bright, and researchers say it may help to help explain why the parachute from
Viking 1 (landed in 1976) remains detectable.

Researchers have used HiRISE to study many types of changes on Mars.

The Curiosity parachute is the largest one of its kind ever constructed, coming in about 65 feet in diameter (you can see a scale here) The gap between the white and orange-hued sections prevented the chute from becoming torn during the descent phase.

Its first image of Curiosity's parachute, above, caught the spacecraft suspended from the chute during descent through the Martian atmosphere.

After
entering the Martian atmosphere at 13,200mph, the capsule containing 
Curiosity slowed by friction and then a supersonic parachute.

An 'upper stage' resembling a flying bedstead was then be deployed, firing retro rockets to brake its descent.

As
it hovers over the landing site, the upper stage transformed itself 
into a 'sky crane' and lowered Curiosity to the surface on the end of a 
tether.

The contraption then broke away, and deliberately crashed.

The latest pictures were captured by the HiRise craft, the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

The 65 kg (143 lb), $40 million instrument was built under the direction of the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.

Curiosity descending to the red planet was captured by the same spacecraft that has now seen its parachute shift on the surface

It consists of a 0.5 m (19.7 in) aperture reflecting telescope, the largest so far of any deep space mission, which allows it to take pictures of Mars with resolutions of 0.3 m/pixel (about 1 foot), resolving objects below a meter across.

It's the Martian version of spring break: Curiosity and Opportunity, along with their spacecraft friends circling overhead, will take it easy this month because of the sun's interference.

For much of April, the sun blocks the line of sight between Earth and Mars. This celestial alignment — called a Mars solar conjunction — makes it difficult for engineers to send instructions or hear from the flotilla in orbit and on the surface.

Such communication blackouts occur every two years when the red planet disappears behind the sun.

No new commands are sent since flares and charged particles spewing from the sun can scramble transmission signals and put spacecraft in danger.

Mission teams prepared by uploading weeks of scaled-back activities beforehand.

'They're on their own,' said Rich Zurek, chief Mars scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The rovers are banned from driving. Instead, they take a staycation and study their surroundings.

The orbiting Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter continue to listen for the rovers and make their own observations, but for the most part will transmit data once Mars is in view again.

Opportunity, Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the European Space Agency's Mars Express have survived previous bouts of restricted communications.

It's the first for Curiosity, which landed last year near the Martian equator to hunt for the chemical building blocks of life.

The positions of the sun, Earth and Mars, at left. Radio communications between Earth and Mars are limited during this planetary alignment, which occurs in April. Spacecraft in orbit around Mars and on the surface will not receive new commands during this period. Next month, Mars will be passing almost directly behind the sun, from Earth's perspective. The sun can easily disrupt radio transmissions between the two planets during that near-alignment.

Beginning Thursday and through May 1, Curiosity can only check the weather every hour, measure radiation and look for signs of water below the desert-like surface. The limited chores are a departure for the active six-wheeler, which is used to driving, drilling and zapping its laser at rocks.

Before the sun got in the way, Curiosity made its biggest discovery yet: From a drilled piece of rock, it determined that its crater landing site was habitable billions of years ago, possessing some of the basic ingredients necessary to support tiny microbes.

Scientists must wait until next month to drill into another rock and start the long-delayed trek to a mountain where Curiosity will search for the elusive organic molecules that are fundamental to life as we know it.

The road trip was supposed to have started last year, but longer-than-expected science experiments put Curiosity behind schedule.

Odyssey, circling Mars since 2001, has experienced half a dozen blackout episodes with no problem. This time, it will try something new.

There are plans to radio Earth every day even if calls are dropped, mostly to keep engineers updated on Curiosity's health. The rover is also programmed to send daily beeps to ground controllers.

By contrast, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will record and store information onboard its computers and beam it back after the hiatus. Opportunity, which parked itself in a clay-rich spot, will use the down time to study a rock and track the amount of dust in the sky.

With Mars missions on autopilot, many scientists and engineers planned to take vacation while a small crew remains on duty.

'We've been through this before,' Zurek said.

'We're not expecting to have any problems during this period. Let's hope it stays that way.'
