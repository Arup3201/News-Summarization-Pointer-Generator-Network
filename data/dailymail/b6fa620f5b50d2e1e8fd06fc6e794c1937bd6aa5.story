Joachim Low, the coach of Germany, took a leaf out of Sir Alex Ferguson’s book of football management when he appealed for Marco Rodriguez to referee strongly and 'clamp down on things' in the World Cup semi-final with Brazil.

Low claimed that the refereeing standards in European football are better in a clear attempt to influence the Mexican referee.

Rodriguez is another referee who was known as a strict disciplinarian before this competition, but he has opted for a liberal approach at the finals.

Low, whilst understandably concerned for the welfare of his technical German side, should make his appeal to the FIFA referees committee rather than make swinging statements intended to pressurise a match official already under pressure preparing to referee the biggest game of his career.

However, Low, like the majority of observers, will have thought that appeal fruitless to a committee who deny having instructed the officials to take a low-key approach and to let the players take centre stage.

Perhaps the wording is inaccurate as FIFA cannot 'instruct' on application of law but they can suggest and guide – and inference plays a huge part in such finals competitions.

It is impossible to conclude otherwise when the strictest of referees currently on the world circuit, Carlos Velasco Carballo, waits for 40 free-kicks before he issues a single yellow card.

Appointment: Marco Rodriguez missed Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini but will take charge of semi-final

Seeing red: Rodriguez sent off Italy's Claudio Marchisio in the same match

Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari was quoted as saying that he wanted Brazil to 'toughen up' and rough-up opponents, and their performances against both Chile and Colombia have delivered on his wishes.

These two powerhouses in world football have only faced each other once before in this tournament, the 2002 final which was refereed by the peerless Italian Pierluigi Collina.

Rodriguez really doesn’t bear comparison to the superb Collina and will be well aware of the issues of handling such a huge game.

However, Rodriguez does not lack confidence and was understandably absolved of any blame when missing Luis Suarez’ bite on in Italy’s Chiellini.

The big question before the match is: will FIFA continue with their desire to allow players to commit almost countless fouls before being cautioned or will they expect the referees to afford the skilful players the protection they deserve?

Rodriguez will know he cannot win as Low’s statement makes it clear that Germany want a change in approach whilst Brazil are benefiting from the leniency afforded them through the tournament so far.

FIFA, in attempting to make this a tournament in which the match officials are unnoticed, have failed and run the risk of allowing the dark arts to win out.

In the last final they were fortunate that Spain had enough skill to defeat the Netherlands despite their over-physical approach. This time they might not be so lucky and more of the World’s top players could just get hurt.
