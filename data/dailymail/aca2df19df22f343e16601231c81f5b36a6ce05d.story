A family judge has ruled that a man who shared a bed with his 13-year-old step-daughter - and even let her shave his chest - did nothing wrong.

The step-father was cleared of abusing the girl by the judge at Swansea County Court after he claimed he got into bed with her when she was feeling ill and lonely, and let her shave him as part of a 'makeover.'

Swansea Council took the case to London’s Appeal Court in a bid to vindicate the teenager who claimed she was a victim of abuse but those claims were rejected today by the Court of Appeal. 

Cleared: Three Court of Appeal judges ruled that the step-father had not done anything inappropriate

Lawyers for the council and the girl’s guardian claimed the decision contradicted the evidence and all conventions of decency with children.

Charles Geekie QC, for Swansea, said the family judge was 'plainly wrong in refusing to find sexually inappropriate behaviour,' noting that the step-father had admitted sharing a bed with the teen 'on more than one occasion.'

Although the man insisted that nothing inappropriate occurred, but Mr Geekie said he admitted on one occasion 'sharing a bed with her in the absence of her mother, and that he had proceeded to put his arm around her bare midriff.'

Other alleged inappropriate conduct included 'showing an interest' in the girl’s pubic hair including joking about it needing a hedge trimmer and allowing the girl to pull down his trousers 'on at least four occasions', he added.

The step-father steadfastly denied misconduct, insisting that his behaviour had to be seen in the context of the family’s particular domestic life and the teenager’s own precocious sexuality, behaviour which included exposing herself in public.

Not a victim: The Court of Appeal supported the original ruling that 
there were clearly 'poor sexual boundaries in the home' but the 
stepfather had not committed abuse (file picture)

He said the bed-sharing incident occurred when his step-daughter had returned ill from school and was feeling lonely.

He told the court: 'I believe she asked to shave my chest, in the same way as she used to ask to do my hair or give me a makeover, so I let her do this.

'As she was still feeling poorly I put my arm around her stomach in order to comfort her and I fell asleep, touching her skin as her top had ridden up slightly.'

The girl’s mother arrived home soon 
after, he explained, adding that he never touched his stepdaughter 
'inappropriately or sexually' and today three top judges said the 
believed his story.

The
issue of alleged sex abuse was first aired before a family judge in 
March this year who said that there were plainly 'poor sexual boundaries
in the home' but cleared the step-father of any wrong-doing.

He
made an order that the girl should live with her mother under local 
authority supervision but rejected all claims of sexual abuse.

Challenging
that decision, Mr Geekie argued the teenager deserved a court ruling 
that would vindicate her claims particularly because of the 'significant
emotional trauma within the family.'

Mr Geekie said: 'She knows that a judge has now found as a fact that she was not abused.

'If, in truth, she was abused, it is important to her that this should be formally recorded.

'A
reversal of the findings will make a significant difference to her 
well-being and the coherence and functioning of her family.'

However, after several hours of intense legal debate, the three Appeal Court judges refused the council’s appeal.

Lord
Justice Longmore, sitting with Lord Justice Underhill and Lady Justice 
Macur, said that the court would give full reasons for its decision at a
later date.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
