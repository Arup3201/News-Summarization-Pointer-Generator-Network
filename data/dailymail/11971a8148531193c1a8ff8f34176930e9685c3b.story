Chelsea Manning is not receiving hormone therapy treatment for her gender identity condition, despite it being approved by U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

The American Civil Liberties Union and Manning's attorney contacted defence department officials, including Hagel, to notify them that a lawsuit will be filed if treatment is not confirmed by September 4.

The former intelligence analyst is currently serving a 35-year sentence at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth for leaking classified documents to the WikiLeaks website.

Manning, who changed her name from Bradley after her conviction, has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria - the sense of being a woman in a man's body.

Manning first sought evaluation and treatment for her gender condition after she was sent to the Fort Leavenworth prison in September 2013.

She is asking for hormone therapy and to be able to live as a woman.

Military doctors confirmed the gender dysphoria diagnosis and recommended a treatment plan, but she has yet to receive any treatment, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

'The continued failure to provide Ms. Manning with this treatment is inconsistent with well-established medical protocols and basic constitutional principles,' Chase Strangio, attorney for the ACLU's Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Project, said in a statement.

Strangio said refusing to treat Manning is 'cruel and unusual punishment' and contended the Army is withholding treatment for political reasons.

The lack of treatment puts Manning at risk for serious long-term physical and psychological harm, her advocates said.

Manning was sentenced last year for six Espionage Act violations and 14 other offenses after she gave WikiLeaks more than 700,000 secret military and U.S. State Department documents.

Manning's request for treatment was the first ever made by a transgender military inmate.

It conflicts with a policy that prohibits transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, but Manning can't be discharged from the service while serving her prison sentence.
