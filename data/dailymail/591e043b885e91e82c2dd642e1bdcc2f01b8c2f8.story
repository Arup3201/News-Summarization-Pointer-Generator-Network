With the Thanksgiving sales upon us and Christmas fast approaching, attention is undoubtedly turning towards the hunt for presents - and the inevitable cost that comes with it.

But a new mobile app has arrived just in time to help ease the strain by actually paying users to go shopping.

Rewardable for iPhone and Android gives users the chance to earn money by completing simple tasks while browsing the stores, eating out and even sitting at home.

Cashback: The new Rewardable mobile phone app gives users the chance to earn money by completing simple tasks such as product reviews or compiling prices while they go shopping

The company behind the app says that one 
user made more than $100 in a single weekend just by photographing the 
signs in local stores and rating the service at a fast food outlet.

In return, companies in effect get an army of inspectors who will carry out stock takes and store audits for them.

Other money-making jobs include gathering local data on prices, offering opinions and feedback, or sharing information about products on social networks.

Camille Whaley of Newtown, Connecticut, said: 'The app is really great. I've been using it while shopping the past few weeks and already made over $100.

'The tasks have actually been pretty fun. For a recent one, I got a free meal at a restaurant was paid to review the service.

'Anyone looking to make some extra money should check it out.'

Rewardable's Twitter page: The company behind the app says that one user made more than $100 in a single weekend just by photographing the signs in local stores and rating the service at a fast food outlet

Rewardable users earn money each time they complete a simple task displayed in the app, with the simple jobs on offer generally taking a few minutes and paying between $3 and $15.

Most tasks are located at stores, restaurants and other commercial locations throughout the U.S, but users can also complete certain tasks at home like sharing advertising campaigns through social media, filling out surverys or giving feedback on apps.

Users can search for and choose tasks through a map or list view.  Selecting tasks enables users to view the guidelines and start on the task using the 'Complete Now' function.  

After completing tasks, users  hit submit and answers will be reviewed for approval by the Rewardable team.

Co-founder: Peter Komassa says the app helps the brand users are reporting on 'and, most of all, is fun'

Payments are then made directly to users' own PayPal accounts.

Most tasks involve helping companies improve customers' experience of their products, including recording the price of on-sale items, checking whether certain items are in stock, taking photos of promotional displays. 

Users could also be asked to measure wait-times at restaurants and share your opinion on the dining experience.

And rewards are offered for sharing information on deals, retailers or brands with social network connections.

Co-founder Peter Komassa recently told the Newtown Bee: 'It gives the consumer a few dollars extra to spend, it helps the store, it helps the brand they are reporting on, and most of all, it’s fun.'

Retailers, consumer brands, restaurants, real estate companies, financial service companies and consulting firms are already using the app as a quick, cheap alternative to lengthy and expensive audits.

Anshuman Vohra, CEO of BULLDOG Gin, said: 'I was extremely impressed by the data that we received from Rewardable. 

'It would have taken me several months to send my sales team into all of our accounts to verify BULLDOG was being presented to our standards, but with Rewardable, we got it done in a few weeks.'

The software is available at the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
