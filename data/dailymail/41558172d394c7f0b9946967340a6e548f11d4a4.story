Schoolgirls carrying flowers, football team members with candles and families carrying balloons gathered in Victoria on Sunday to emotionally farewell the Van Den Hende family just three days after they perished on flight MH17.

Hundreds of people from the tightknit community of Eynesbury, 40km west of Melbourne's CBD, gathered on the lawn of a rural property to farewell Shaliza Dewa, Hans Van Den Hende and the couple's three children, Piers, 15, Marnix, 12, and Margaux, 8.

The Malaysian-Dutch family of five are among the 38 Australian citizens and permanent residents who are being remembered in the days after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 went down over eastern Ukraine.
