He visited supermarkets but did so with an AK47 casually slung over his shoulder and he was pictured celebrating his wedding but his bride had travelled to Syria to find a herself a holy warrior.

Ibrahim al-Mazwagi was one of a group of Londoners - now thought to include Jihadi John - among the first to travel to Syria to fight in about 2012.

It's believed Jihadi John - this week unmasked as Brit Mohammed Emwazi - was one of more than 700 fighters in the Katiba al-Muhajireen (The Migrants Brigade) who arrived in the Middle East three years ago.

Pictures of members of the brigade have flooded social media in recent years and a video of al-Mazwagi, who is the first British jihadi known to have died in Syria, lifted the lid on life as a terrorist - from shopping for cereal to target practice.

Unmasked: Mohammed Emwazi from London was this week revealed as the man behind the 'Jihadi John' mask 

A source who claimed to have met Emwazi in Syria told Channel 4 News that he was a member of one of the earliest groups from London who travelled to fight for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate.

Shiraz Maher, of the King's College London's radicalisation centre, said he was investigating whether Emwazi was among the group, which also includes Mohammad el-Araj and Choukri Ellekhlifi, both killed in 2013.

Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'We know that around the same time he (Emwazi) is said to have gone to Syria that a group of men from the same area of London also travelled to Syria with the same ethnic background - they were arabs.

'From everything we have studied and what data shows is people typically go in groups - with friends who know each other - they usually live close by.'

'Things suggest they may well know each other but we can't substantiate it. These guys are all dead which makes it hard for us to know whether he knew them.'

Mr Maher said it appears that Emwazi survived, and has become one of the most prominent members of the Islamic State group - a fighter whose confidence and Western accent are calculated to strike fear into viewers of the group's grisly videos. 

Al-Mazwagi, from North London was 21 when he was killed in Syria in February last year. 

A graduate from Hertfordshire University, he was of Libyan origin and moved to Syria where he told his family he was doing charity work. 

Ellekhlifi, 22, was killed fighting alongside extremists in Syria and funded his trip by mugging people in Belgravia, London.

He was one of three British men killed as their group - the Al-Nusra Front - attacked pro-government forces near the city of Aleppo on August 11. El-Araj, 23, was killed two weeks later during a firefight.

Among the brigade’s most notorious alumni is Abu Omar al-Shishani, one of the most feared military commanders of the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq

Al-Shishani, a red-bearded ethnic Chechen and former sergeant in the Georgian Army - became the commander of the brigade, which was initially aligned with al-Qaeda's Jabhat al-Nusra.

The group merged with other jihadists in March 2013 to form Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar [Army of Emigrants and Supporters], a larger and more structured group with a religious council.

In May 2013, Shishani switched to supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and was named commander of the northern sector of Syria, around Aleppo.

A video obtained and published by Channel 4 in 2013 shows life as an extremist in Syria - likely the experience of Emwazi before he went to fight for Islamic State.

Speaking to camera, al-Mazwagi said: 'I didn't travel across the world - I spent a lot of money and I left a lot of what I love and I left a comfortable lifestyle - just to come here and blow up some kids.

'I could have easily done that back home.'

And asked when his fight will end, he added: 'When I die. I would rather fight in the path of Allah, protecting his religion, than be with my wife. 

'I have got unlimited time after I die to spend with my life, I don't need to spend it right now.

This week the true identity of Jihadi John was revealed to be Londoner Mohammed Emwazi. The Islamic State killer was born in Kuwait before moving to Britain at six years old.

Given a council flat overlooking the Regents Canal in the exclusive Little Venice area of West London, his father found work as a minicab and delivery van driver while his mother stayed at home with Mohammed and his two younger sisters, now 25 and 23.

After finishing primary school in 1999, young Mohammed moved to Quintin Kynaston Community Academy, in St John’s Wood.

Once there, he became more observant of his religion and began wearing more traditional Islamic dress. It was only after he won a place studying computing at the University of Westminster that his behaviour began to change.   

Friends told the Washington Post he was already talking wildly about travelling to Syria, where the uprising against Bashar al Assad was beginning in earnest. 

His parents reported him missing after three days but claimed it was four months before police arrived at their home and said they had information he was in Syria.
