A massive rockfall in the Yosemite National Park saw some 16,000 tonnes of boulders crash 500 feet down a cliff, obliterating everything in their path and closing a popular hiking trail.

Officials say the rock fell 
from a cliff above the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir east of Wapama Falls, crushing trees and sending up clouds of dust as it broke up into numerous boulders.

Fresh boulders were left completely covering the slope, with many tumbling down into the reservoir below.

Park officials say nobody was hurt in the slide, which happened on March 31, but around 400 feet of the Rancheria Falls Trail were destroyed just east of the Wapama Creek footbridges.

The trail will remain closed for the forseeable future, however Park officials say hikers can still get to Wapama Falls by starting at O'Shaughnessy Dam.

The Rancheria Falls Trail, a 13 mile round trip, takes in a less popular section of Yosemite but still attracts many hikers providing stunning views of the surrounding landscape.
