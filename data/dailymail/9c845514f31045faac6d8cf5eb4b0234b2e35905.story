Young people used to worry about getting friend requested by their parents on Facebook, but now they should be on the look out for grandpa and grandma.

A whopping 71 per cent of all online adults are now members of the social network, and membership among senior citizens has grown a full 10 per cent in the last year - from 35 to 45 per cent of those ages 65 and older according to a new Pew Research study.

Facebook has remained the dominant social networking site. Eighty-four per cent of people who reported using just one site say their membership is for Mark Zuckerberg's creation.  

Growing: Facebook is still the dominant social networking site. It grew to include 71 per cent of all online adults this year, compared to 67  per cent last year

But competing with Facebook isn't necessarily the game plan for other popular sites like Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn, who have focused their branding on specific groups of people.

For example, Pinterest, the online bookmarking site, is especially popular among women over men. Thirty-three percent of online women use Pinterest compared to just 8 per cent of men.

And the branding seems to be working for the sites, since more and more online users are joining different social networking sites. This year 42 per cent of users had taken up using two platforms.

Diversifying: Another trend in this year's report is how more social network users are branching out to more platforms

'People are diversifying their portfolios when it comes to [social networks],' Pew Senior Researcher Aaron Smith told Mashable. 'The addition of a Pinterest user is not necessarily taking away a Twitter user of a LinkedIn user.'

Click habit: The study also tracked how often social media users logged into their sites. Almost just as many Instagram users uploaded and checked that site as did users on Facebook

LinkedIn is another more specialized site that attracts a high amount of college-educated users since its purpose is job networking. It's also the only site to have a higher percentage of users 50-64 years old than the 18-29 age bracket.

Twitter and Instagram on the other hand are significantly popular among young people and African-Americans.

Twenty-nine per cent of blacks use Twitter and 34 per cent use Instagram. Both had a majority of users in the 18-29 age group, 31 per cent on Twitter and  37 per cent on Instagram.

This similarity in user make-up is also probably why many Twitter users are also on Instagram, and vice versa.

This was the first year that Pew released a social media matrix, and it showed a strong correlation between the two sites, with 53 per cent of users on one using the other as well - the highest rate of reciprocity for any two sites excluding Facebook.  The study also looked into how often users check their social networks every day.

While its not surprise that 63 per cent of Facebook users check the site at least once a day, visiting rates were nearly just as high over on Instagram where 57 per cent of users uploaded or checked photos once a day.

And that's good news for both platforms since Facebook bought the picture-sharing site earlier this year.

It should also be noted that all of the companies in the study, except Pinterest, are publically traded.

Pinterest is estimated to be worth $4billion and is expected to go public at some point.

The study was conducted between August 7 and September 16, 2013. The interviews were conducted over the telephone by Princeton Survey Research Associations International of 1,801 adults across the country, 18 and older.
