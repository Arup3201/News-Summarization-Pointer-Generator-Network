Field: The cow was found lying in a field on the family's ranch on 52nd Street near Bell Rd in Phoenix on Friday

Sgt. Steve Martos told KPHO-TV: 'The early indications are that perhaps this cow was injured by someone who may have thrown these softballs at this cow'

Sgt. Steve Martos told KPHO-TV: 'The early indications are that perhaps this cow was injured by someone who may have thrown these softballs at this cow.'

'Unfortunately, as I understand it, this cow had to be put down by a vet.'

The cow had to be euthanized by a veterinarian, who told authorities a potato-launcher was likely used because of how badly the animal was hurt. 

Authorities said that some of the 13 softballs found were the property of Desert Shadows Middle School. 

Neighbors said they were 'sickened' by anyone who would hurt an animal and they hoped that local children had not committed the crime.

David Jones, lives near the ranch where the cow was injured.

He said: 'We actually love having this rancher here. It kind of gives you a sense of country in the neighborhood, driving by and seeing the cows and seeing the farmland. So, it really disturbs me that somebody would do this in our neighborhood.'
