Newcastle tight-head Kieran Brookes has been called into England’s training squad after David Wilson became the latest player to join Stuart Lancaster’s lengthy casualty list.

Wilson, 29, has started England’s 10 previous Tests but a nerve problem in his neck means he will sit out Friday’s training session, before facing further assessments by team medical staff.

Brookes has been capped six times by Lancaster, who could also be without key players including Tom Wood, Brad Barritt, Geoff Parling, Owen Farrell, Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan, Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury for the opening RBS 6 Nations fixture against Wales next week.

‘We have brought Kieran in as cover at tight-head as a precaution because Davy has a small nerve impingement which should settle down,’ said Lancaster.

Also joining the group at Pennyhill Park is London Irish centre Shane Geraghty, who last played for England in 2009 and has rediscovered his form with the Exiles this season.

Lancaster added: ‘I didn’t want to cause any further disruption to the Saxons so Shane’s addition is a good opportunity for him on the back of good form and helps us to train with appropriate numbers on Friday.’
