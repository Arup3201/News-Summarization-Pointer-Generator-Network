Scientists have revealed the key to predicting climate change - and it lies in the excrement produced by earthworms.

Researchers from the University of York and 
the University of Reading discovered that earthworm faeces - also known as casting - contain tiny granules of calcite.

After keeping different earthworms at different temperatures, they were able to prove that these granules retain a 'memory' of the temperature of the air in which they are excreted.

This means that by studying fossilised samples of earthworm poo and testing the residual temperature of the granules inside, scientists can now track changes in the Earth's climate over thousands of years.

Researchers from York and Reading universities have discovered the tiny granules of calcite found in the faeces of earthworms, pictured, retain the outside temperature at the time it's excreted. By studying fossilised samples of this casting, scientists can track how the Earth's climate has changed over the years

The small lumps of chalk-like material and their change in temperature can then be used to predict future climate trends.

In the study, published in the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, researchers said the lumps appear to be uniquely marked by whatever temperatures they encountered in the surrounding environment at the time the worm excreted them.

The researchers proved this by keeping the earthworms at different temperatures.

Isotopic testing 
- a test which monitors the movement and in turn the temperature of molecules - was then carried out on the calcite granules in each earthworm's casting to discover that the different granules retained the temperature at which they were formed.

Tiny granules of calcite, similar to the one pictured, are found in earthworm casting. It retains the temperature of the air around it and can be used to track changes in the Earth's climate

Principal investigator Prof Mark Hodson, of the University of York’s environment department, said: 'There are many conflicting theories about why earthworms produce calcite granules, but until now, the small lumps of chalk-like material found in earthworm poo have been seen as little more than a biological curiosity.

'However, our research shows they may well have an important role to play, offering a window into past climates.'

Lead author Dr Emma Versteegh, from the department of geography and environmental science at the University of Reading, added: 'This knowledge about past climates is of vital importance for developing and benchmarking climate models that make predictions for the future.

'These chalk balls will allow us to reconstruct temperatures for specific time intervals in which they were formed.'

University of Reading Professor of archaeology Stuart Black said: 'We believe this new method of delving into past climates has distinct advantages over other biological proxies.

'For example, we believe it will work for the full seasonal range of temperatures.'

The researchers are now collecting samples from archaeological sites dating back thousands of years to build up a picture of past climates and how the future climate will develop.

Dr Stuart Black, from the University of Reading’s Department of Archaeology, added: 'We believe this new method of delving into past climates has distinct advantages over other biological proxies.

'For example, we believe it will work for the full seasonal range of temperatures, whereas methods such as tree rings, do not 'record' during winter.

'In addition, because the chalk balls are found in direct context with archaeological finds, they will reveal temperatures at the same location.'
