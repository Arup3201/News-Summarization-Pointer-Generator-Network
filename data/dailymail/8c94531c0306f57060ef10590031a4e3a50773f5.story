A cat has been left with broken legs and a collapsed lung after being thrown 100ft from the window of a fifth-storey flat.

The male tabby was launched from the tower block in Croydon, south London, before crashing onto the pavement.

The pet, who was spotted by a passer-by, was rushed to a vet and treated for a broken femur, a collapsed lung and shattered rear legs.

The woman's children saw the pet being thrown from the block of flats.

The RSPCA Putney Animal Hospital, which is looking after the pet, is now trying to trace the cat's owners.

He was not microchipped or tagged when he was found after the shocking incident.

Inspector Nick Wheelhouse said it was amazing the pet had survived but said he was in 'a really bad way'.

He said: 'Understandably this poor cat is in a really bad way and we would really like to trace the owner as soon as possible.

'It is amazing he has survived but he has broken legs and is in a bad way.

'He is in such a sorry state we feared the worst for him.

'He must be someone’s pet and they may be wondering where he is.

'When he was found he had no microchip or tag, just a blue flea collar.

'We would also like anyone with information about this incident to come forward.

'This would have been an extremely distressing incident for the cat and he has been left in a lot of pain with very serious injuries.'
