'Firestorm': Birmingham City Council CEO Mark Rogers predicted a 'serious' response from Ofsted's forthcoming report

Schools in Birmingham under investigation for their involvement into an alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot to force religious extremism into children's education have been warned to expect a 'bloody firestorm'.

Headteachers from the schools affected by simultaneous investigations from Ofsted, Birmingham City Council, and the Department for Education were warned by the local authority that a forthcoming report would have 'serious implications' for the schools in question.

The chief executive of Birmingham City Council told those present that the investigation - prompted by allegations of an extremist Islamic takeover in the city's schools - that the Government would use a forthcoming report as a stick to beat them with.

Mark Rogers said: 'In early June that [Ofsted] report is made, published in the public domain and some kind of bloody firestorm will occur.

'The Secretary of State's [Michael Gove's] response will then repeat that firestorm as he decides what to do about that report'.

In the recording, acquired by the Telegraph, he went on to say the document will have 'serious implications for all of us', implying that the Government could intervene over the way the investigated schools - a mixture of academies and council-run schools - are run.

He added: 'We're not stupid - we know that this might provide a platform for the Secretary of State to put some further structural proposals on the city council'.

According to the newspaper, Mr Rogers went on to criticise the head of Ofsted, whom he said would deliberately focus on radicalisation and extremism in schools.

He also attacked Education Secretary Michael Gove, saying he did not expect his 'firestorm' response to be 'moderate and considered'.

However, the meeting heard that the council's own investigation had so far not discovered any evidence of extremism.

The recording comes a week after the headmasters' union said that 'concerted efforts' had been made to infiltrate the Birmingham schools - which could even spread to other cities.

The general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said some teachers were being appointed because of their Muslim faith rather than their skills.

There was also evidence of ‘pressure’ being brought to bear on heads to adopt ‘certain philosophies and approaches’.

Inquiry: On Wednesday, the names of 18 schools at the centre of the alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot were revealed in a list by Birmingham City Council. Above, one of the schools, Gracelands Nursery School in Sparkbrook

Speaking ahead of the union’s annual conference in Birmingham, he said: ‘We ourselves have concerns about what has been going on in and around half a dozen of those schools.

‘There have been things going on inside our schools which would make some of us feel uncomfortable.’

Meanwhile, it was claimed that dozens of teachers pushed out of schools by an alleged Islamist takeover plot are too afraid to speak out because of gagging orders.

Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood said at least ten teachers told him they were made to sign agreements offering cash in return for their silence.

Ofsted is now inspecting 21 schools over the plot - whereby Muslim extremists infiltrate state schools and run them according to Islamic principles.

Birmingham City Council is also investigating 25 schools.

A spokesman for the council said it could not comment while the investigations were taking place.
