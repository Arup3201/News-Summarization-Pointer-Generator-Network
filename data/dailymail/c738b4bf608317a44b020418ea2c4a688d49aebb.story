Contacts in the Gulf: Financier Amanda Staveley, who was once Prince Andrew's girlfriend and is seen here pictured in 2004 - brokered big deals in Qatar

Barclays is being investigated over £12billion of investment from Middle East royals that saved it from being nationalised.

The bank – already reeling from a string of scandals – admitted that City watchdogs were looking at four of its employees, including finance chief Chris Lucas.

The Financial Services Authority is concerned about massive investments made in Barclays by the royal families of Qatar and Abu Dhabi during the depths of the banking crisis in 2008.

The deals were masterminded by two 
of the world’s most powerful financiers, Prince Andrew’s former 
girlfriend Amanda Staveley and Roger Jenkins, who is dating supermodel 
Elle Macpherson.

Miss 
Staveley, herself a former model, has built up an unrivalled 
relationship with some of the Gulf’s wealthiest and most powerful 
investors.

It was she who brokered Abu Dhabi royal Sheikh Mansour’s £210million purchase of Manchester City Football Club.

She
 also acted as the sheikh’s  go-between when he invested £3.5billion in 
Barclays, and her company, PCP Capital Partners, is estimated to have 
made some £40million on that deal alone.

Mr Jenkins, whose worth is estimated 
at £300million, brought £4.5billion of investment from Qatar, earning 
himself an estimated £30million in the process. He was later part of a 
group that raised another £4billion from Qatar.

The
 deals helped Barclays avoid the fate of rivals such as Royal Bank of 
Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, which were forced into state 
ownership in the credit crunch.

There
 was controversy at the time, because it was claimed the Middle Eastern 
investors were getting a better return on their money than ordinary 
shareholders could expect.

But the FSA investigation centres on 
fees paid for ‘advisory services’ by Qatar Investment Authority to 
Barclays in the Middle East’ as part of the deals.

It
 is understood that the regulator is concerned by a lack of transparency
 around what advice the Qataris were offering Barclays and what they 
were being paid for it.

The FSA's concerns focus on the Qatari investment suggesting Mr Jenkins is at the centre of the probe.

Chairman Marcus Agius was cagey about the latest probe, the disclosure of which came as Barclays unveiled a 13 per cent rise in profit during the first half of the year to £4.2billion.

‘Investigations like this happen frequently,’ he said. ‘Typically they are not disclosed or made public at all. The fact it’s being disclosed is at our request because one of the four people named is our finance director.’

But he refused to offer any more detail, repeatedly saying ‘Enough!’ when asked for more information.

The bank’s reputation has sunk to an all-time low after a series of mis-selling scandals and revelations that it had artificially manipulated the Libor rate used by banks to lend money to each other.

Finance chief Mr Lucas is the last man standing of Barclays’ former top three: Chief executive Bob Diamond fell on his sword over the Libor scandal and while Mr Agius reversed his initial resignation over the same matter, he is due to step down as soon as a replacement can be found.

Mr Agius yesterday claimed customers 
had been sympathetic to the bank’s woes, adding that some had even 
brought bunches of flowers and cake to cheer up cashiers.

‘I’m open to cake,’ he joked.

But
 he added: ‘We are sorry for the issues that have emerged over recent 
weeks and recognise that we have disappointed our customers and 
shareholders.’
