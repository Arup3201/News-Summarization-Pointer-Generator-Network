An Alfa Romeo bought by Benito Mussolini for his girlfriend has been sold for £1.4million after being lovingly restored.

The Italian dictator gave the 1939 car to his mistress Clara Petacci – only for the pair to be caught when the vehicle was stopped as they tried to flee from Italy at the end of the Second World War.

The 6C Sport Berlinetta, which sat in a barn in America for 21 years from 1949, has been brought back to its former glory – and snapped up at auction.

Mussolini met up with Petacci at Lake Como after she travelled in t meet him in the four speed, 110 horse power vehicle. The pair then planned to seek asylum in Switzerland.

A motorcade they were in, which included a retreating German anti-aircraft unit, was stopped at a roadblock near the town of Dongo on April 27, 1945.

The fascist leader and his mistress were both identified before being shot dead and their bodies hung upside down at a petrol station.

Petacci’s Alfa Romeo was confiscated and eventually acquired by an American Army Air Corps officer, Major Charles Pettit. 

He shipped the two-door sedan back to his family’s farm in New York State in 1949, but when the vehicle broke down it was put into a barn.

The vehicle was given a new lease of life in 1970 when it was purchased by Ron Keno of Mohawk, New York for $300

In late 1978 or early 1979, the partially restored Alfa Romeo was sold by Keno to collector Donnie Morton, of Connecticut, who ultimately passed it to the Imperial Palace Auto Collection

The vehicle was given a new lease of life in 1970 when it was purchased by Ron Keno of Mohawk, New York for $300.

The antiques dealer was eventually put in touch with Franz Spogler, a former Nazi whose job it had been to drive Petacci and Mussolini in the 6C towards the end of the war.

Correspondence between the pair convinced Keno that he had ownership of the historic car.

In late 1978 or early 1979, the partially restored Alfa Romeo was sold by Keno to collector Donnie Morton, of Connecticut, who ultimately passed it to the Imperial Palace Auto Collection.

Staff restored and displayed it as part of their vast holdings of rare and coachbuilt automobiles for the next two decades, until it was sold to another long-term owner in 1999. 

Former glory: The Alfa Romeo's new owner had the car’s six-cylinder engine (pictured) rebuilt in Italy

The vehicle has been lovingly restored over the years to bring it back to its former glory

The vehicle was sold along with a number of other classic cars with an estimate of between about £1.5m and £2million

The new owner had the car’s engine rebuilt in Italy and at the turn of the century, the owner undertook a two-year, 500,000 Euro restoration.

It went under the hammer at a sale organised by RM Auctions in Paris.

Peter Wallman, from RM Europe, is quoted by Yahoo as saying: 'The history of this car certainly gives you something to talk about.

'The Mussolini provenance adds interest, but first you need to be captivated by the 6C’s harmonious shapes, its delightful rear spats and raked grille.'

The vehicle was sold along with a number of other classic cars with an estimate of between about £1.5m and £2million.
