Pensioner benefits including free TV licences, bus passes and help with heating bills could be cut under government plans to limit welfare spending.

Iain Duncan Smith warned existing protections for a raft of benefits would have to ‘disappear’ once the government sets a limit on the £100billion welfare bill.

The state pension will be specifically excluded, but the Work and Pensions Secretary made clear that additional payments made to pensioners would not be exempt from any future squeeze.

There is growing tension in the Cabinet over where up to £12billion in benefit cuts should fall.

Chancellor George Osborne has made clear the pain should be felt by working-age claimants.

But the Lib Dems and even some senior Tories are dismayed at the reluctance to consider cuts to pensioner perks.

David Cameron has vowed to honour his 2010 election pledge not to cut pension benefits including the winter fuel allowance, free TV licences and bus passes.

Mr Duncan Smith is understood to be among urging that a commitment to leave universal pensioner benefits untouched until 2015 should be reviewed after the next election.

In the Autumn Statement Mr Osborne announced details of a new cap on total welfare spending.

At the start of the Parliament the government would have to set a limit on the amount which will be spent on benefits each year, currently around £112billion, and if it is breached ministers would be hauled to explain themselves to the Commons.

Giving evidence to MPs yesterday, Mr Duncan Smith revealed that pensioner benefits would be included in the welfare cap raising the prospect of them being cut if spending ran out of control.

‘We need maximum flexibility with the cap. Pretty much all existing ringfences will have to disappear,’ he said.

The new welfare cap will include most benefits within the control of ministers, but will not include Jobseekers Allowance or the state pension.

While the idea of limiting total spending has proved popular with the public, the government has face criticism over what this might mean for individual benefits.

In December Mr Cameron admitted that maternity and paternity pay for new parents would be included in a new cap on welfare spending.

The cost of the benefits, which are paid to mothers and fathers who take time off work to look after their children, is set to exceed £2.5billion a year within four years as more parents take them up.

But within hours of the the Prime Minister confirming that they will be covered by a new, overall cap on most welfare spending the Treasury was forced into a pledge that it would not cut them in the next Parliament.

Chris Leslie, Labour’s shadow Treasury minister, said: ‘There are clearly major divisions within the Government over whether to cap pensioner benefits.

‘One minute Downing Street are ruling it out and the next Iain Duncan Smith is ruling it in. It is time for the Government to come clean over what exactly they are going to do with pensioner benefits.’

A government source said: 'We have been very clear that the state pension will not be included in the welfare cap.

'We will announce more details about what will be included in the cap in our manifesto.'
