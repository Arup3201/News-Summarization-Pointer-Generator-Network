Despite the ever growing popularity of online dating, virtual platforms are no match for interactions in the real world when it comes to finding true love, a new Australian study has found.

Almost half of all Aussies surveyed by ticketing company Eventbrite said they met their partner at a live event. One in three people said they'd exchanged phone numbers at an event with someone they fancied and one in ten said they'd fallen in love. 

The survey found the most common hooked-up hotspots were live sporting and music events, followed by business and networking events.

The most common places to meet a potential life partner in Australia are sports and music events, followed by business and networking events, according to the EventBrite survey of 1000 Australians

Passions in common: Kari Vallury met her husband Trillock at a world music event. The couple married last year at Adelaide's WOMAD music festival surrounded by 170 family and friends.

From a survey of 1,000 Australians commissioned by EventBrite:

35% of people (1 in 3) exchanged numbers

32% of people (1 in 3) kissed someone

30% (1 in 3) Approached someone they fancied at an event

24% of people (1 in 4) held hands with someone new at an event

16% of people (1 in 6) slept with someone they met at an  event

10% of people  (1 in 10) have fallen in love with someone they met at an event 

41% of people said 'None of these'

Food and wine, educational and fundraising events also featured in the study as likely places to find that special someone. 

The odds might be encouraging for hopeful singles jaded by too many uninspiring online connections.

Of the 100 survey respondents, 32 per cent, or one in three people, said they had exchanged a kiss with someone new at a live event.

One in six people had slept with someone they met at an event and one in ten said they'd fallen in love.

When it came to preferences between virtual dating and real-world romance, the real world won out by a long mile.

97 per cent of people surveyed said they'd prefer to initiate a conversation with someone they fancied than to 'like' a photo of them on social media (just 3 percent) and 93 per cent of people said they'd rather lock eyes with someone across a room for the first time than receive a friend request on Facebook.  

As things develop, 95 per cent of people said they'd rather introduce their new mate to their friends in person than post a 'selfie' with their date to social media. The vast majority of people (92 per cent) would rather introduce their new lover to their parents than change their relationship status on Facebook. 

'No replacement for real life connections': 93 per cent of survey respondents said they'd rather lock eyes with someone across a room than receive a friend request from a love interest on Facebook

'While more and more first time interactions are being formed via apps and social media, the study findings are resounding proof there is no replacement for real life connections in taking a possible love match to the next level,' said Laura Huddle, Head of Marketing at Eventbrite Australia. 

'Live experiences of all shapes and sizes bring people together to celebrate their common interests and passions,' she says. 

'Being in a place with like-minded people and similar interests encourages people to be open and live in the moment.'

It was certainly true for South Australian couple Kari and Triloks Vallury, who met at a world music event at an Adelaide bar and, after 18 months together, decided to get hitched at the city's famous WOMAD music festival last year.

'We hoola hooped in the gardens:' Kari and Trillock Vallury met through their shared love of music and were married 18 months later at WOMAD 

'We both love WOMAD. The food and ambience is everything we would want at our wedding. Trilok suggested it as a joking idea at first, but I contacted them and within a few months we got married there!' says Kari. 

She says 170 family and friends celebrated their union with them at the festival and the best part was not having to organise entertainment.

'We did the ceremony as soon as the gates opened, before the music started. We then went to see several bands with a big following of guests, ate great food from the Womad vendors and hula hooped in the gardens.'  

With the Australian festival season in full swing, now could be the perfect time to get out there and find your perfect match.
