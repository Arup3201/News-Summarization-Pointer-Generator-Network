This is the unusual orphaned lamb who understands the true meaning of being a sheep dog.

Timmy was just weeks old when he realised that his ambition was not to frolic in the fields with his woolly friends - it was to be a puppy.

Now he lives in a kennel, eats dog biscuits and likes nothing more than a long walk in the countryside with his owners.

Now that just takes the biscuit! Timmy the sheep was taken in by Samantha Perry and her husband Eric, pictured, and raised on their smallholding alongside the couple's seven dogs

Baa-king: Timmy looks rather funny eating dog treats with his canine friends

Walkies! The 18-month-old was bottle-reared by the Perrys and slept in a kennel while growing up

Timmy was bottle-reared by Samantha and Eric Perry at their smallholding in Aston-on-Trent, Derbyshire, from after he was orphaned at just a few days old.

The 18-month-old, 200lb animal was originally allowed in the house, and now lives outside in a kennel along with six dogs belonging to the farm.

Mrs Perry, 42, said: 'Timmy definitely thinks he’s a dog - he always has.

'He will eat absolutely anything we give him but his favourite food is dog biscuits. He absolutely loves them. When we take the dogs for a walk, he thinks nothing of coming along with us.

Unique character: Mrs Perry said the 200lb animal is very popular with children in the village of Aston-on-Trent

Fish out of water: Timmy chose to act like a dog, but he could just as easily have decided to mimic the farm's donkeys, geese, ducks or cats

'He’s become quite a popular figure with the people in the village, especially the children. They seem to love him.'

Clover Leaf Farm is also home to a Yorkshire terrier Poppy, seven; Shih tzu Daisy-May, five; three-year-old Cairn terrier Tyson; Jack Russell Sapphire, two; and Jack Russell/Yorkshire terrier cross Barney, also two.

They have now been joined by Pandora, a nine-month-old Chihuahua.

And the menagerie does not stop with Timmy and the dogs.

Peculiar pet: Timmy was  raised alongside the couple's six dogs, who include a Yorkshire terrier, Shih tzu, Cairn terrier, Jack Russell and a Chihuahua

Born to be different: The couple's grandson Oliver Perry feeding Timmy and another lamb when they were young

The Perrys also have three donkeys, including nine-week-old Marley, geese, ducks and cats.

Mr Perry has owned the smallholding for 20 years and they have lived there for 10 years.

Mrs Perry said: 'Bearing in mind Pandora is only nine months old, she took to Timmy straight away and he is great with her and all the other dogs, just getting on and doing the things they do.

'I suppose some people might see having a pet sheep as a bit strange but we don’t see it that way. To us, he’s just part of the farm.

'The fact that he thinks he’s a dog at the same time just adds a little eccentricity.

'The other dogs accept him as one of theirs and he seems perfectly happy.

'We are used to all these animals running around anyway so why not have a sheep joining in the fun, too?'
