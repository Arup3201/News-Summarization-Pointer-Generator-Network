A couple has been reunited with their baby nine months after she was taken into care by a council who accused her father of being a terrorist and tried to put her up for adoption.

Misty Barnes was removed from her parents Cheryl Rich and Jack Barnes when she was one-month-old after social workers decided she was in danger.

In adoption papers Mr Barnes, 39, said Thurrock Council in Essex called him a terrorist and a threat to national security, who had knowledge of making bombs and had threatened to blow up buildings.

Reunited: Jack Barnes and Cheryl Rich with their daughter Misty Barnes, nine months after she was taken from them because a local council called him a terrorist

They also alleged he was a violent armed robber, who had served eight years inside Belmarsh Prison and had pumped his dogs with steroids so they could cage fight.

Mr Barnes was jailed for arson and handling stolen goods when he was younger, and has also been convicted of growing cannabis.

But he adamantly denies the claims made by the council and the couple have won a legal battle to get their child back.

Misty's mother Cheryl, 26, said: 'I was upset, confused and scared when they took Misty away.

'We went back to the flat and broke down. But it's amazing to have her back in our lives now - it's been so hard.'

Mr Barnes added: 'We have had to stay strong through this. The council tried to break us.

'I've had run-ins with the law before, and they were all a long time ago.

'I haven't got any convictions for violence. I would never hurt Cheryl or Misty.'

He said being accused of being a terrorist was just 'ridiculous'.

Accusations: Mr Barnes says the family are thrilled to have their daughter back. The 39-year-old has admitted he has been in jail before, but denies that he was a terrorist or domestic abuser

He added: 'I'm not perfect, but that was unbelievable. I think the council were looking for a reaction from me.

'I know how the legal system works and so I told Cheryl that we need to write everything down and keep all our evidence.'

He added: 'The council hasn't apologised to us. Now we want a full inquiry to place.'

Jackie
 Doyle-Price, Tory MP for Thurrock, said the council was guilty of a 
major injustice and owed the couple, of Grays, Essex, a huge apology.

'While
 the family are reunited now, nothing can replace the time they have 
lost. A major injustice has taken place her,' she said, adding: 'Thurrock council owe this family a huge apology.'

In
 addition to the false accusations, the council managed to mix Misty's 
case up, putting the authority in breach of strict data protection 
rules.

Row: Thurrock Council has refused to discuss the case and says the couple should complain if they are aggrieved by their treatment

The couple's 
solicitors were sent paperwork regarding the wrong child and a document was submitted to court by the council with the wrong child, 
wrong sex and even the wrong local authority council listed on it.

She
 said: 'Whilst there were reasons to be concerned for Misty's welfare, 
social workers treated Cheryl as a victim of domestic violence, which 
she was not.

'The council argue the court would not have approved the first care order unless the action was fair.

'However, the papers filed with the court by the council contained untruths which Jack and Cheryl could not challenge.'

The council refused to comment in detail on the case, but a spokesman said: 'The family has been asked to provide a detailed written complaint, setting out all their issues so it can be investigated properly by a non-council, independent person.'
