Scrap: George Osborne was told by business leaders that the 50p tax band is strangling entrepreneurship

More than 500 business leaders last night called on the Chancellor to axe the 50p top rate of tax in the forthcoming budget.

The leaders of some of Britain's most successful small firms warned George Osborne that he should ditch the 'politically motivated' tax on those earning £150,000 because it will 'damage the economy'.

They pointed out that the tax plus National Insurance means that the entrepreneurs the government wants to create jobs are being taxed at 58p in the pound once National Insurance is considered.

Responding to claims from the Liberal Democrats that the rich must shoulder more of the burdens of austerity, the business leaders said that the top 1 per cent of taxpayers are already paying 28 per cent of income taxes.

In a letter to the Daily Telegraph, they said: 'Penalising high earners through an unfair, politically-motivated tax puts populist politics before sound economics.

'The result is that the 50p tax is set to reduce government income, and damage the economy, the public services and charitable giving.'

The letter will fuel demands by Tory MPs for the Chancellor to slash the 50p rate, which is seen as a class war measure introduced by Labour that does nothing to raise tax revenues since it simply drives entrepreneurs abroad.

But the Lib Dems have said there can be no moment on the 50p tax rate until the threshold at which people pay the basic rate of income tax to £10,000.

The letter continued: 'The tax, which is in effect a 58p tax after national insurance is taken into account, puts wealth creators like us in a very awkward position.

'We believe the richest should help the poorest in society. But 1 per cent of taxpayers are forecast to contribute nearly 28 per cent of income taxes.

'As businesspeople, we want to see our industries, our economy and the third sector thrive.

'Repealing the 50p tax would be a good demonstration of the Chancellor's wish to celebrate British entrepreneurialism, stimulate British industry and contribute to the Government's growth agenda. The sooner this tax is repealed, the better.'

It comes as official figures suggest the controversial 50p tax rate, which hits everybody earning more than £150,000, has been a flop.

In January, the tax take from people who do self-assessment tax returns collapsed by more than £500million, compared to the same month in 2011.

The receipts dropped from £10.86 billion in January 2011 to £10.35billion in January 2012, a fall of £509million.

It confirms repeated warnings from accountants that many wealthy people would simply do everything possible to avoid paying the tax.

For example, many business executives decided to pay themselves a big bonus or dividend before it came into effect in order to avoid losing half of it in tax.

Mr Chris Jenkins, Managing Director of BWS Security Systems Ltd, who signed the letter, said: 'Since the 50 per cent tax band was introduced I have stopped taking a salary or dividend that takes me into this higher tax band. I am living off my savings and reduced my over-all spending. Basically, I have chosen not to pay this higher level of tax.

'The loser in this case is HMRC. First, they miss out on income tax revenue. And second, my reduced spending means I am contributing less VAT. My advice to the Government is simple: stop killing the goose that lays the golden egg.'

Andrew Denny, Managing Director of Fix-a-Form International, said: 'I am simply trying to create wealth for me, my kids and my loyal staff. Why are high earners treated like they have committed a crime and should be punished?'

Charlie Mullins, Managing Director of Pimlico Plumbers, who signed the letter said: 'Ultimately, the 50p tax is self-defeating and will end up hurting the whole of society, not just the rich.

'I don't mind paying my fair-share of taxes. We all want to live in a fairer society. This is what makes Britain great. But the 50p tax is excessive and anti-entrepreneurialism.'

Treasury sources say the Chancellor has always made clear the 50p tax rate is 'temporary' but that nothing will happen until an assessment of the tax has been completed.
