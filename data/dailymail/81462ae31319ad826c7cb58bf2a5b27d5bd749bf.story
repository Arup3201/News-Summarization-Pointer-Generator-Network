England were put through their final paces on Friday while coming to terms with a slapstick setback, as Danny Care was ruled out of the first Test against New Zealand following an ‘hilarious’ training-ground accident that soon turned sour.

The Harlequins scrum-half was officially withdrawn from Saturday’s series opener against the All Blacks at Eden Park once it became apparent that he had failed to recover from a shoulder injury in time to play. His removal means that Ben Youngs of Leicester will join forces with Freddie Burns in an untried half-back combination, while Lee Dickson comes on to the bench.

It emerged that Care’s injury stemmed from an incident on Monday that initially prompted much amusement among team-mates and management. Asked how the 27-year-old had hurt his shoulder, defence coach Andy Farrell said: ‘It’s his own fault actually.

The All Blacks haven’t lost at Eden Park since 1994.

They were beaten by France 20 years ago but have since won 31 Tests in a row.

‘It was a 
s**t kick. He actually stubbed his foot on the floor, missed the ball 
completely and it was absolutely hilarious. He fell over and hurt his 
shoulder. I burst out laughing but then realised it wasn’t too funny.

‘It
 was a little grubber through on the floor, which he mis-kicked. He 
won’t be doing it again. I’ve got it on tape. I showed it to all the 
lads the next day; it was hilarious. But it wasn’t quite as good two 
days later when he wasn’t playing in the Test match. Anyway, we’ll get 
over it.’

The
 joke lost its appeal very quickly, as the loss of Care is another 
grievous blow to English hopes of causing an upset in the opening clash 
with the world champions. He was an integral part of the team’s 
attacking development during the Six Nations and his vibrant presence 
will be sorely missed.

Yet,
 Farrell suggested the coaches are optimistic that the Yorkshireman will
 be available for selection in Dunedin next week. ‘He was very close,’ 
he said. ‘He's a couple of days off and we expect him to be fully fit 
for next week, but his strength wasn't quite there.

‘He's
 settling down nicely, but the player has to be mentally right that he's
 100 per cent fit. We have good replacements in Ben and Lee. Danny will 
rest this one out and start training again on Monday and Tuesday next 
week.

‘He's been in great form, not just throughout the Six Nations when he was outstanding, but he finished the season really well at Harlequins. In general he was in very confident mood coming over here and was looking forward to the tour.’

England have been beset by the absence of so many leading lights for this first Test, due to a pile-up of injuries and fixtures. But the tourists are refusing to be demoralised and accept a grisly fate against Steve Hansen’s experienced, outstanding Kiwi team. Farrell claimed that the visitors will take heart from some rousing performances and results on the road in the last two years.

‘We’re not frightened of the occasion – of going to these places and giving it a good crack,’ he said.

'For some of these guys, it’s new to come here, it was new to go to South Africa and for some of them it was new to play in Paris. Everything is new to us but we don’t shirk it. There is always a fighting spirit there. The fighting spirit has been in this team since the start.’

The All Blacks haven’t lost at Eden Park since 1994. Their imperious record in their Auckland lair and their dominance of this rivalry over the decades is a grim omen for England, but they are determined to ignore it. ‘We know we’ve only won twice here,’ said Farrell. ‘We know we’ve only beaten the All Blacks seven times.

‘We are aware of the history, but we’re more aware of our own history of late and that’s a side that started two years ago and guys are averaging 20-25 caps. They’ve been through a journey together and we’re seeing the improvements. There’s still a long way to go, but we need to come to places like New Zealand, to test ourselves and see where we’re at.’
