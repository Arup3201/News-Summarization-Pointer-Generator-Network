A couple aged 76 and 79 said 'I do' for the second time yesterday - 58 years after they first got married.

Ollie Ingram, 76, and Wills Holmes, 79, from Drayton Bassett tied the knot back in 1955 but broke up ten years later and then married new partners.

But the couple met up at a family party 18 months ago when they were both widowed and rekindled their relationship.

Wills and Ollie Holmes are now married for the second time - 58 years after they first said I do to each other

They got married for the second time in a civil ceremony at a hotel in Tamworth, Staffs., using the exact same rings they bought at 17 for their first wedding.

The grandparents walked down the aisle to the apt Barry White song 'My first, my last, my everything'.

They were joined by 100 friends and family for the 30-minute ceremony - before enjoying a party with the music provided by a band rather than a gramophone like their first wedding

Speaking after they tied the knot on Saturday afternoon, Ollie said: 'We didn’t want a normal wedding, we wanted it to be like a big party.

'That’s why there are no hats or ties, we just wanted our guests to come and enjoy the day.

'Our first wedding was a white church wedding but it was very simple because we couldn’t afford much.

'There was only close family and a handful of friends and we had the reception above a pub with a gramophone playing the music.

'We were together for ten years and had 
two children but we had got married too young and it was our first 
proper relationship so things went wrong and we split up.

'Wills remarried twice after me and I lived with a partner for 15 years before I got married again too.

'But I met up with Wills at a party my daughter from the second marriage was having around Christmas last year when we were both widowed.

'We agreed that Wills would stay at my cottage that night but I didn’t expect it to be in my bed.

'We shared a Christmas kiss and he ended up staying a fortnight, then went back to Darlaston to get his things.

'We got engaged again last Christmas -
with the same ring he bought me when I was 17. Wills has not changed, 
he's still the same.

'I am glad our second wedding was more of a party and everyone seems to have enjoyed it.'

Wills added: 'I never thought I would be lucky enough to marry the woman of my dreams twice in one lifetime.

'Ollie looked as beautiful as the first time and we know it will last this time.'

The couple first met in their hometown of Darlaston, West Mids., when Ollie was 14 and Wills was 17.

They married four years later on Christmas Eve in 1955 at St Joseph's Catholic Church in the town and had two children, Scott, 53, and Lisa, 49.

When their marriage fell apart, Ollie moved to Tamworth, Staffs., where she had four more children with her second husband Carl Ingram and worked at Drayton Manor for 25 years.

Wills stayed in Darlaston where he worked in engineering and got married for a second and then third time.

Ollie’s husband passed away three years ago aged 72 and Wills’ third wife died last summer.

The lovebirds then met up by chance at Christmas last year when their daughter Lisa took Wills along to a family gathering.

Ollie agreed her ex-husband could stay at her cottage that night but he ended up staying a fortnight before selling his house in Darlaston and moving in.

Romantic Wills proposed a few weeks later and even used the exact same ring he bought when they first got engaged.

And the couple, who have four grandchildren, say they are determined to make it work second time around.

Wills said: 'This time we'll make it work.

'Ollie is as outgoing as ever, she hasn't changed one little bit.

'I suppose we do have some regrets that it didn't work out first time round, but we were just too young.'

Ollie, who also has two other grandchildren from her second marriage, added: 'I never thought we would get back together but we have had such a fabulous 18 months together, holidays and so much fun and laughter.

'This time will be for keeps.'
