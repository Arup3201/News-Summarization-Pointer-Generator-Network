A homeless Brazilian man has slept alongside the corpse of his dead friend for 13 years.

Fábio Beraldo Rigol, 47, was discovered 
sharing space with a dead body after locals noticed he kept disappearing
into the Brotas cemetery in Santa Isabel, Sao Paulo.

Mr Rigol, a former office worker, said drug abuse drove him out of his family home and with nowhere to live he found refuge in a tomb.

Fabio Beraldo Rigol sleeps in the crypt alongside his dead friend in Santa Isabel, Sao Paulo

Mr Rigol said he sleeps in the cemetery after being kicked out of his home because of his drug abuse

He said he chose a large crypt to sleep in with
six burial chambers.

Only one of the shelves is being used by his 
dead friend who has been buried there for over ten years.

Mr Rigol, who has the nickname 'Popo', told G1: 'I want to come out of here alive.

'I
want to have a house and I would like to go back to work if I get the 
chance. It would be awful to die and be dead with the dead.'

During the day, ‘Popo’ spends his time 
wandering the streets in the town as he says it is pretty lonely in the 
grave yard because there is no one to talk to.

He claims he has not seen 
any spirits and is not scared about sleeping in the dark with a dead 
body.

'I'm not afraid of the dead. I’m more afraid of the living,' he said.

The former office worker said he hopes to get his own home one day and find a job

Mr Rigol said he knows the cemetery like the
palm of his hand and often wanders through the burial site trying to 
see if he recognises any of the names interred there.

He has seen many 
funerals which he admits leaves him depressed.

'I do not like to see them. I prefer to remember the people as they were, bright and happy,' he said.

Mr Rigol said he used to be a dispatch rider for a business but he lost his job when the company went bankrupt.

He said: 'I started using drugs and was kicked out of the house. After that I started roaming the streets and ended up here at the cemetery,' he said.

'It was night and raining heavily. I remember very little about how I got here but when I woke up, I was in a tomb.

'I do remember that I asked permission to enter the place, after all, it’s wrong for anyone to break into a house.'
