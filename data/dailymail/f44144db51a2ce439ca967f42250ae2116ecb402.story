A Motorist who pulled over into a bus lane to give way to two fire engines was fined £30.

Ian Pemble paid the charge after council officers sent photographic evidence of him apparently breaking the law.

However, when the 67-year-old asked for further proof, he was sent footage which showed two fire engines racing past his car seconds after he moved into the bus lane.

Council officers sent Mr Pemble these photos of his vehicle apparently flouting the law

But seconds later a fire engine appeared, showing why Mr Pemble diverted

The council admitted that officers issued the penalty without fully considering the circumstances on the A4 in Bristol last month

Mr Pemble appealed against the fine and has now had his money back, together with an apology from Bristol City Council.

They admitted officers issued the penalty without fully considering the circumstances on the A4 in the city last month.

Mr Pemble, a music journalist, said: 
‘I  knew I was in the area but I wasn’t sure whether I had just nipped 
into the lane at the last moment.

‘The pictures got me thinking about  
where they put the cameras and whether they are at the end purposefully 
to catch people out.’

He continued: ‘I paid my fine. But I was so annoyed with them and I know my rights, so I asked for more evidence.

‘And it was lucky I did because when 
they sent through the video, it clearly shows me moving out of the way 
of two fire engines.’

Mr Pemble, who lives in Bristol, 
added:  ‘I nearly fell off my chair when I saw  the video for the first 
time. It came as quite a surprise.

‘I was absolutely delighted to find I was squeaky clean and a good boy. You can’t have a better excuse than that.’

Yesterday a spokesman for Bristol City Council said: ‘The council is to refund Mr Pemble’s penalty charge.

‘The team have reviewed the footage and it is clear that he had moved into the bus lane for a fire engine.’

She added: ‘Actions by motorists to 
allow access for emergency services occur regularly and they are 
normally picked up when the footage is examined prior to a Penalty 
Charge Notice being issued.

‘However, it was missed in this instance  in error. We will write to Mr Pemble  to apologise.

‘Motorists who believe they have 
received a penalty in error should always appeal.The council is happy to
review any case and cancel the charge where appropriate.’
