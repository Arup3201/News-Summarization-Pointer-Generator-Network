The housekeeper for Richard Simmons denies claims he's suffering from 'debilitating depression' amid reports he's become a recluse in his Hollywood mansion.

It's said fitness fanatic Simmons is in desperate need of a knee replacement and risks never being able to exercise again if he continues to avoid the routine procedure, according to TMZ.

The operation would reportedly be his second replacement, the first he delayed having for a decade, in four years.

A source told TMZ: 'Doctors told Richard he needs a left knee replacement and if he doesn't get it he will never be able to exercise again.'

On Thursday, TMZ reported that eighties fitness guru Richard Simmons hasn't been seen in a year and has been spent that time holed up in his Los Angeles home, depressed over a knee surgery that could leave him without the ability to exercise.

Simmons is allegedly 'paralyzed with fear and depression' as pressure grows to have the operation which sparked his reclusive behavior in 2014, TMZ say.

However a housekeeper who lives on the property insists there was nothing to worry about regarding Simmons' physical or mental health when speaking to MailOnline today.

The housekeeper, named Teresa Reveles, is allegedly tasked with turning friends or associates away when they come to visit him, said: 'He's perfectly fine. He's home and he's fine.'

It comes as Simmons himself took to social media to thank fans for their 'outpouring of love and concern' following the surprising news of his well-being.

In a post on his official Facebook page he said: 'I am so touched by the outpouring of love and concern that I have received today. I have had a tough time dealing with this injury, as it is keeping me from doing what I truly love to do and that is to teach classes around the world.'

Reynold Gideon, who lives directly opposite, tells MailOnline exclusively that Simmons' housekeeper is adamant the sparkling fitness fanatic is merely 'resting'.

Mr Gideon confirmed that Simmons had issues with his knee but believes he's doing well and is most likely to be working on something new, he understands from many conversations with the gym guru's staff.

Mr Gideon explained: 'I think he's working on a new project, he's constantly recreating himself because the man has so much energy. He's a wonderful neighbor to have.'

'He told me about a knee problem months ago but I've not seen him since so I don't know of any updates with it,' Mr Gideon explained.

One concerned neighbor pulled over their vehicle to ask MailOnline if the dazzling star had died, such is his absence in the community.

The woman, who declined to be named, enquired: 'Is he dead? We're all quite worried, nobody has seen him in months. It's so out of character but nobody knows what to do.'

An unidentified man arrived at the property to hand-deliver documents in an 8.5 by 11-inch brown envelope, received by Simmons' housekeeper, but refused to comment regarding the nature of his visit.

Simmons was last seen in public on January 11 at a charity event and has avoided his own famed studio 'Slimmons' in Beverly Hills for several months.

Since his 80s heyday Simmons has constantly sought to regain his faded fame, and can be easily recognized in LA by his bushy hair and trademark exercise shorts and tank top.

In 2011, the fitness guru had Dancing With The Stars viewers talking about his seemingly slimmed down build whist appearing on the show to coach celebrity contestant Chaz Bono.

The 63-year-old's smaller frame sparked speculation that something was awry, and perhaps he might even be ill - though this speculation was later quashed by his agent.

Simmons continues to run the Beverley Hills exercise studio, called Slimmons Studio, that he established in 1974.
