The family of Canadian freestyle skier Sarah Burke, who died Thursday after an accident during a training session, launched a fundraising website to help collect money to cover the estimated $200,000 in medical bills.

Burke, who was 29 at the time of her death and one of the top half-pipe athletes in the world, died at the Salt Lake City hospital where she was taken last week following the accident in Park City, Utah.

She had sustained ‘irreversible damage to her brain due to lack of oxygen and blood after cardiac arrest’, according to a statement released by her publicist.

Now faced with massive debt due to his late wife’s medical bills, donations have come flooding in to a website dedicated to helping Burke’s husband Rory Bushfield pay for the expenses.

Though originally the costs were originally estimated to be around $500,000, they were updated and lowered to $200,000.

By Saturday morning, the site had already raised $246,701 which cleared all of her medical costs.

‘Due to the outpouring of love and support, enough funds have been raised to cover the anticipated costs related to Sarah’s medical care based on the numbers received from the hospital,’ the site read.

There are potential complications with Sarah’s insurance coverage because she was treated in an American hospital as a Canadian citizen, and because she is only contractually covered by her health insurance when competing in a sanctioned event.

Fatal accident: Sarah Burke crashed on the same halfpipe where snowboarder Kevin Pearce sustained a traumatic brain injury in 2009

Sarah died after an accident on a training run for an event sponsored by Monster Energy Drink.

She fell on the Eagle Superpipe in Salt Lake City, Utah, after performing a trick known as a Flat Spin 540.  

Peter Judge, the CEO of Canada's freestyle team, said the injury was due to a 'freak accident' after a trick that was well within her capabilities.

He said she performed that stunt ‘many, many times,’ and it ‘was certainly in the realm of her skill capabilities.’

‘This injury was one - it was more of a freak accident than one caused by anything in specific terms,’ he continued.

‘It was more of a fluke outcome. Safety was paramount to her.’

A four-time Winter X Games champion, she crashed on the same half-pipe where snowboarder Kevin Pearce sustained a traumatic brain injury during a training accident on December 31, 2009.

As a result of her fall, Burke tore her vertebral artery, which led to severe bleeding on the brain, causing her to go into cardiac arrest on the scene, according to publicist Nicole Wool.

Miss Wool said Burke's organs and tissues were donated, as she had wanted.

The statement said: 'The family expresses their heartfelt gratitude for the international outpouring of support they have received from all the people Sarah touched.'
