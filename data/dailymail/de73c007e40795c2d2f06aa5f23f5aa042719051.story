Two of four people who were found dead in a vehicle on a
secluded road in northern Alabama were facing child pornography and molestation
charges in Tennessee, police said.

Winston County Sheriff Rick Harris said two people found
fatally shot in a vehicle on Wednesday night near Double Springs had court dates
in Tennessee the day their bodies were discovered.

Authorities say the car containing the bodies was parked in
the William B. Bankhead National Forest. The area is about 60 miles northwest
of Birmingham.

Harris said the victims - three men and a woman - were from
Tennessee. Their identities have not yet been released.

The victims' bodies were found in a white car with out-of-state
license plates and authorities say a passer-by noticed the vehicle on her way
to work. The woman called police when she noticed the car parked in the same
place on her way home.

Throughout the day, Harris stressed that authorities
believed the discovery of the bodies was an isolated incident.

‘No one in our area was endangered or is missing at this
point,’ he said. ‘To our knowledge, there's no one locally in our county
involved.’

Dozens of law enforcement officers were at the scene just
south of the Double Springs area Thursday and police haven't identified any
potential suspects in the slayings.

‘We spent all night processing the scene and we took the
vehicle to an indoor location to process the vehicle,’ Harris said Thursday
morning.

Investigators were waiting on results of forensics testing.
He said the Alabama Bureau of Investigation is assisting his agency with the
case, as well as the coroner and district attorney's office.
