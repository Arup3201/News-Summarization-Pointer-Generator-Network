Emerging from his campaign bus with ‘Better Together’ helpfully written on his hand, John Prescott had one simple job to do – convince Scots voters they should stay in the UK.

But it was one simple job too far for the former deputy prime minister, who quickly seemed to forget his brief and instead caused division.

Clutching notes that reminded him that he was ‘Welsh and Northern’, he didn’t exactly have them rolling in the aisles when he told an already hostile crowd that the England and Scotland football teams should be combined.

Labour bruiser John Prescott appeared to have been given instructions not to forget to mention the cross-party Better Together - with reminders on his notes and even the back of his left hand

His scrawled notes also included references to being Welsh, buying whiskey at the airport and how he was not planning to talk about currency uncertainties

Not content with that, he then suggested Labour voters were not clever enough to understand the arguments about independence, leading one senior party source to brand him a ‘f****** moron’.

Lord Prescott, 76, was in Rutherglen, near Glasgow, to take on the Scottish nationalists with only a week until the referendum, but he seemed to be stuck in general election mode, launching an attack on the party’s Better Together allies, the Tories.

At one point, Lord Prescott, who famously punched a man who threw an egg at him on the campaign trail, lost his temper and shouted in the face of a man who had heckled him.

He turned to the man who had been chanting, ‘Thirty pieces of silver’, and said, ‘Listen, I’d give you 30 pieces of silver to just shut up’. The Labour peer was told ‘you’re mental’ by a man in the crowd after he said England and Scotland should unite their football teams in order to beat Germany.

‘When I got on the campaign bus they told me it was the Scottish football team’s coach? I’ve got a revolutionary thought for you,’ he told the crowd of both Yes and No activists.

‘Perhaps if England and Scotland together had one team, we could at last beat the Germans, who knows?’

He later claimed his remarks had been a joke, but added: ‘There is a serious question there about whether England, Wales, Germany (sic) should be treated as separate teams in Europe.

'But I’m not making that proposal . . . the national feeling in the countries is they wouldn’t want to. 

'They still want to shout for England even though we lose every bloody time. They want to shout for Scotland.’

The former Deputy Prime Minister waved a copy of the Daily Mail, which today published an article by Prime Minister David Cameron

Lord Prescott was surrounded by No campaigners, as he insisted he would not talk about currency unions but about a more simple argument about why Scotland was better off in the UK

Lord Prescott even suggested England and Scotland should form a joint football team to 'at last beat the Germans'

The Labour Party has argued that in the event of a No vote there will be further devolution to Scotland as they and their pro-union allies – the Conservatives and Lib Dems – have each promised this.

But Lord Prescott cheerily went off-message, saying: ‘When Cameron is up here he talks about devolution. They fought us for 30 years on devolution. They do not believe in it.’ Clutching a copy of yesterday’s Daily Mail front page featuring the Prime Minister’s plea to Scots to remain in the UK, Mr Prescott said: ‘I picked the Mail up, never been known to pick the Mail up.

‘What a headline. Cameron says, “don’t rip our family apart”. Bloody hell, they’ve ripped our families apart for decades.’

Lord Prescott then seemed to suggest the issues surrounding the referendum debate were too complex for Labour supporters. He said: ‘I’m not here necessarily to talk about the currency and all the uncertainties, most Labour voters will find that very difficult to understand.’

Yes and No campaigners jostled on the streets of Glasgow, yelling slogans and trying to drown out Lord Prescott's speech

The visit came as Ed Miliband gave a speech in Cumbernauld, near Glasgow. The Labour leader was challenged by a party member who urged him to apologise for the lacklustre campaign.

Rosemary Holmes told him: ‘This might be the time to say we in the Labour party miscalculated because we thought the message was clear about what we stood for and what we were promising in this referendum.

‘That message is coming out now with a timetable, but we have eight days to go. We have to try something different – we have to be honest and say, “sorry, we got it wrong”.’

Mr Miliband yesterday said he would be campaigning in Scotland all week. A poll last night showed that support for independence among Labour voters had fallen from 30 per cent to 26 per cent in the past fortnight.
