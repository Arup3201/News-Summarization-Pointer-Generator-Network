Thunder and torrential downpours are due to batter the country tomorrow, with more than a week’s rain expected to fall in just 24 hours.

The Met Office has issued severe weather warnings over fears that hour-long bursts of rain across southern England and Wales could cause localised flooding.

In particular, motorists are being urged to take care as a build-up of surface water will make for dangerous driving conditions.

Up to 2ins of rain – a third of October’s average – is forecast, with storms moving into the Midlands and the North later in the day.

The sudden turn in the weather follows a drier than average September.

Met Office spokeswoman Laura Young said: ‘We have included Wales, the North West and Midlands in our severe weather warning because we cannot be sure how quickly this front will pass through the country.

‘However, it is the bottom third of the UK – the South East and West of England, southern Wales and London – where we expect the worst of the weather. In the worst affected areas we could see 15 to 20mm fall in just one hour.

'Over the course of the day that would not be too much but all at once that can lead to surface level road flooding.

‘That means it will feel quite heavy at times and could lead to some localised flooding. We would advise motorists to take extra care on the roads and be sure to adjust to the difficult conditions.

‘In total there will be around 30 to 50mm of rainfall throughout the day, which if you consider that on average we only get around 150mm for the whole of October, is quite a lot.

‘We would also urge people to keep checking our website because, while the warning is only at yellow right now, there is always the chance it could be upgraded.’

She added: ‘It should clear by  Friday with parts of the country blessed with a splattering of sunshine throughout the weekend.’

The predicted downpours are in sharp contrast to last month, which was among the driest in recent years.

Miss Young said: ‘We had around 30 per cent less rain last month than expected. It was the 25th driest September since records began well over 100 years ago.’
