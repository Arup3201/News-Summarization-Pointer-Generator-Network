 Tim Sherwood is emerging as a strong candidate to replace Tony Pulis as Crystal Palace manager.

Eagles chairman Steve Parish has identified Sherwood - who was sacked as Tottenham manager at the end of last season - as a potential contender to take the vacant reins at Selhurst Park.

Parish will hold talks with the 45-year-old in the coming days as he looks to appoint Pulis' successor.

Sherwood is looking for a route back into the game after leaving White Hart Lane.

He came close to becoming Pepe Mel's successor at West Brom earlier this summer, but a move to the Hawthorns collapsed over personal terms.

And the former Blackburn midfielder could now be set for a return to football with Palace.

Other early candidates for the role include former Cardiff chief Malky Mackay and ex-Norwich manager Chris Hughton.

Mackay has been out of work since his acrimonious exit from Cardiff in December and he now wants a return to the game.

He has close links with Palace sporting director Iain Moody having worked with him at Cardiff.

 Hughton, who was sacked by Norwich towards the end of last season, is understood to be an outsider for the role.

Parish knows he must appoint a new manager sooner rather later with the transfer deadline now just 16 days away.

The club still intend to strengthen their squad before the September 1 deadline, but know they need a manager in situ before pressing ahead with deals.

Pulis walked away from Palace on Thursday night following emergency talks with Parish about their differences over the club's transfer strategy.

First team coach Keith Millen will take the team for Saturday's visit to Arsenal.

 And he said: 'What Tony brought in was the experience and knowledge of what it takes to stay in this league.

'That was the biggest thing that the staff took on straight away. We have lost a great leader of the football club and a leader of men if you like.

'He likes to control what goes on in the football club, but he also controls the players. He is close to the players and he works them hard.

'He’s very structured and organised and single-minded. He knows what he wants and you either do it or you don’t and the players understood that.

'The players have been asking why (has this happened). This has happened three times now, so they was asking why.

'It’s been important to reassure them they’d done nothing wrong. Tony loved working with them. So there were no problems there.

'Now, all of a sudden, they’re wondering who’s going to come in, what direction we’re going to go in.'
