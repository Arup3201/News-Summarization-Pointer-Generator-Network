A lawsuit has been launched in an effort to reclaim millions of dollars from Australian businessman Geoffrey Edelsten in order to repay his huge debts in the US.

On Wednesday the former millionaire's stateside bankruptcy trustee Soneet Kapila kicked off a case in the Melbourne Federal Court in a bid to seize local assets.

Among these assets are millions worth of property, luxury cars, shares, and loans, News Corp Australia reported. Mr Edelsten declared bankruptcy in the US in Ohio in January of this year.

Mr Kapila was ordered by Justice Jonathan Beach via Mr Edelsten's Australian lawyer Leon Zwier to contact more than 40 creditors - both companies and individuals - who Mr Edelsten is believed to owe money to.

These beneficiaries include the Australian Tax Office, to whom Mr Edelsten owes $4.58 million, and the National Australian Bank who are out of pocket $3.8 million according to case files.

Additional parties Mr Edelsten owes money to apparently include Carlton Football Club, Etihad Stadium, Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and his 90-year-old mother Esther who resides in a luxury retirement village in Melbourne.

In the filings the 71-year-old apparently admitted his debts could top $50 million, with American Express and the City of Melbourne also owed funds.

Mr Edelsten's estranged business partner Rafael Mawardi is reportedly the main beneficiary in the US with $10.4 million owed to him.

The pair have a colourful past together with partnerships in the form of fashion label House of Nurielle and a casino in the Dominican Republic behind them.

Mr Edelsten's Australian case is due back in court for a hearing on October 10, while the US bankruptcy case will return to a Florida court on September 15.

The former doctor, who was de-registered in the late 1980s, was married to American socialite Brynne Gordon until earlier this year.

His current girlfriend is US model and DJ Gabi Grecko and the pair got engaged a few months back and are apparently set to wed in early 2015.
