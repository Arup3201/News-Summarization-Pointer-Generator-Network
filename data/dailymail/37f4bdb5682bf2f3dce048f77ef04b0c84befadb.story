An 18-year-old girl died just a week after a hospital scan failed to pick up signs of deep vein thrombosis.

Laura Pincher suffered a cardiac arrest after a hospital missed the blood clots in a scan recommended by her worried GP.

The teenager from Stourbridge, in the West Midlands, collapsed at her home on October 28 last year and was pronounced dead within an hour at Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley.

Missed chances: Laura Pincher suffered a cardiac arrest after a scan failed to detect 'massive' blood clots

An inquest heard that the student had been to see her GP, Dr Debbie Foulds, seven days before her death after noticing that her left calf was 3cm bigger than her right.

Dr Foulds sent Miss Pincher for an urgent assessment at the hospital, setting off a chain of events that culminated in the tragedy.

Dr Jonathan Tatton, a fellow GP at the practice, said: 'One of the things we would be thinking of was DVT - deep vein thrombosis.

'It’s a GP’s role to highlight the risk. As soon as you’ve highlighted the risk it needs to be assessed in a properly set-up clinic.

Worried: Miss Pincher had been to see her GP after noticing her left calf was 3cm bigger than her right

Dr Anthony D’Sa, a doctor at the Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust, who specialises in radiology, said a Doppler ultrasound scan carried out the next day had not detected blood clots.

But he admitted: 'I don’t think there’s any test that’s 100 per cent successful in picking up symptoms.'

He told coroner Angus Smillie, sitting at Dudley Coroner’s Court: 'At any stage it’s a matter of putting together how the patient presents and the blood tests and examination.

'We had enough information at that stage to say that there wasn’t a thrombus [blood clot] within the legs.'

At a follow-up visit with Dr Tatton on October 23, Miss Pincher and the GP accepted the findings of the scan, concluding the pain in her leg must have been caused in a recent accident when she had tripped on some wood.

But just five days later, on the morning of her death, Miss Pincher visited a Walk-In Centre in Dudley.

She complained of worsening shortness of breath and a chesty cough - but was sent home with antibiotics and a new inhaler to combat her asthma.

Pathologist Dr Swapna Ghosh said Miss Pincher had died of 'massive' blood clots in both lungs, giving deep vein thrombosis and morbid obesity as underlying factors.

Mr Smillie ruled death was due to natural causes, declaring that the scan had been concluded satisfactorily.

But Miss Pincher's mother Jane said afterwards: 'How can they say an 18-year-old girl has died of natural causes when there’s a blood clot in her lungs? That’s not natural.'

Commenting on the inquest, Paula Clarke, chief executive of the Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We would like to express our sincere condolences to the family of Laura Pincher for their tragic loss.

'We acknowledge the coroner’s verdict that, sadly, Laura died from natural causes.'

In some cases of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) there may be no symptoms, but possible symptoms can include:

* Pain, swelling and tenderness in one of the legs (usually the calf)

* A heavy ache in the affected area

* Warm skin in the area of the clot

* Redness of the skin, particularly at the back of the leg, below the knee

DVT usually (although not always) affects one leg. The pain may be made worse by bending the foot upward towards the knee.

If DVT is not treated, a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot that has come away from its original site and become lodged in one of  the lungs) may occur. This creates more serious symptoms such as:

* Breathlessness, which may come on gradually or suddenly

* Chest pain, which may become worse when breathing in

* Sudden collapse
