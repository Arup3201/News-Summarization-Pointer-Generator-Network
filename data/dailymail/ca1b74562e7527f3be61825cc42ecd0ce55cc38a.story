Two women came to blows in front of shocked travellers after one of them was accused of jumping the queue at an airport in Thailand.

Passengers pulled out their phones to record video and snap photos as the fight erupted at Bangkok’s Don Mueang International Airport on Friday.

According to one of the witnesses, there was an orderly queue at a check-in desk for budget airline Thai Lion Air, but travellers became furious when a woman from China cut in front of them.

The Chinese traveller and a woman from Thailand began shouting and were briefly involved in a physical fight, the Bangkok Post reported.

After trading blows for a few seconds the brawl was broken up by several men who were in the queue, but the women continued to scream at each other.

Friday’s airport rage incident follows a series of clashes or disturbances this month involving Chinese passengers.

In one incident, a female passenger, who was upset because she wasn’t seated next to her boyfriend, threw a cup of hot water and noodles into the face of a Thai AirAsia flight attendant.

The women, reportedly from China and Thailand, were separated but continued to argue

During the chaos her boyfriend jumped out of his seat and made a threat to blow up the Nanjing-bound plane, which was forced to turn around and make an emergency landing in Bangkok.

That incident led to the Chinese travellers being called ‘barbarians’ by China’s state-run media, and the country’s government vowed to severely punish the couple and two travel companions.

In a scathing statement, China’s National Tourism Administration said the tourists disrupted the flight, hurt other passengers and ‘badly damaged the overall image of the Chinese people.’

Days later, a mum was involved in a brawl on an Air China flight from Chongqing to Hong Kong after two women complained that her crying baby was making too much noise.

The two women reclined their seats fully backwards, which led to the mid-air scuffle.

In another incident, a man on board a Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu caused panic when he opened the emergency exit just before take-off as he 'wanted some fresh air’.

Only days before, a man opened the emergency exit and deployed the slide after wanting to 'get off quicker' from his China Eastern flight that landed at Sanya Fenghaung International Airport in Hainan.

Incidents involving Chinese tourists making angry outbursts have prompted Beijing to issue stern guidelines on behaving abroad.
