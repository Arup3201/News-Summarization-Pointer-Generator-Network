Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson has been given a one-match touchline ban and fined £10,000 after arguing with a fan during the club’s loss to Liverpool earlier this month.

‘Nigel Pearson has been fined £10,000, will serve a one-match touchline suspension, and warned as to his future conduct, subject to any appeal, after he admitted using abusive and/or insulting words towards a spectator,’ the FA said in a statement on Friday.

Pearson (right), who watches his side’s games from the stands and relays instructions to assistant Craig Shakespeare on the bench, revealed he had an argument with a home fan at the King Power Stadium during the 3-1 defeat by Liverpool on December 2.

‘I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he doesn’t like what he sees, then don’t bother coming,’ Pearson said at the time.

‘If they (the fans) cannot see the players are having a proper go maybe they need to stay at home.’

Leicester, who are bottom of the Premier League, visit West Ham United on Saturday.

The Foxes made an impressive start to their first season in the Premier League since 2004, the highlight being their 5-3 demolition of Manchester United in September.

However, results have tailed off dramatically — the Midlands side have failed to win in an 11-game run consisting of two draws and nine defeats.
