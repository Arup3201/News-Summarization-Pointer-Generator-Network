A young couple in Brooklyn were beaten up Monday in what police are calling a racially-motivated attack.

30-year-old Ronald Russo and his wife Alanna, also 30, were stopped at the intersection of Avenue U and East 58 Street near Kings Plaza Shopping Center Monday when they had the green light.

Mr Russo couldn't go though because a group of teenagers were blocking his way, so he honked his horn.

The group of 10 black youths ranging in age from 12 to 18, including a 12-year-old girl, got agitated and started kicking his car.

Hate crime: The attack on a white couple by 10 black youths happened Monday at the intersection of Avenue U and East 58 Street near the Kings Plaza Shopping Center in Brooklyn, New York

Things got worse when my Russo got out of his vehicle to survey the damage.

The kids turned their attention to Mr Russo, dragging him to the ground and began punching and kicking his head.

During the attack, the group reportedly shouted slurs at the couple including 'White motherf*****!'

According to court papers, some of them screamed: 'Get those crackers! Get that white whore!'

Mr Russo suffered a fractured nose, a broken septum, a blood clot and abrasions to his shoulder.

While calling 911, Mrs Russo was singled out by the 12-year-old girl who grabbed her by the hair and threw her on the ground. She suffered a black eye and was bleeding but refused medical attention.

Her husband was taken to Beth Israel Medical Center where he was treated and released. His iPhone was stolen during the attack, according to police.

The group scattered after the attack but police arrested two teens in a Lowe's parking lot shortly after - Kashawn Kirton, 18, and Daehrell Finch, 17.

Police say they also arrested the 12-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy.

But Kirton, an 18-year-old St Francis College student from East Flatbush, says he was not involved in the attack and was arrested because he was wearing the same outfit as one of the attackers.

'I have relatives who are white. Cousins and stuff,' he told the New York Daily News. 'My school is mainly white. More than half of my friends are white. I wouldn't use words like that.'

Kirton was charged with gang assault, harassment, and menacing charges - all as hate crimes. He was released on $50,000 bond and has no prior arrests.

Finch also faces gang assault, assault, menacing and harassment but they have not been labeled hate crime charges. Finch's prior record includes assault, theft of services and trespass charges and he is being held on Rikers Island.

Police are still looking for six more suspects in the case.Â
