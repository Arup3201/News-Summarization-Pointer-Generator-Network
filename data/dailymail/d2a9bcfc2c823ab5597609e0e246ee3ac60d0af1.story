An amputee has amazingly returned to playing high school football.

Koni Dole, of Huntley, MT., returned Friday night to the field less than a year after having his right leg amputated below his knee. Not only is he playing again, but he made a significant contribution in his first game back since the horrific injury that changed his life.

Mr Dole broke his right leg while playing football, doctors told him he’d never play again.

Determined to play: Koni Dole took less than one year to return to the football field following an amputation

A senior at Huntley Project High School, Mr Dole horrifically broke his leg during the team’s last game of the 2012 season.

‘I was just kind of like, 'Why does this have to happen to me?’ Dole told ABC News. ‘I know what it feels like to have a last game. Or what I thought was my last play.’

Multiple emergency surgeries later, the leg was severely infected – doctors gave him the option of contracting major illness from keeping it, or amputate. Mr Dole went ahead with the amputation.

‘As soon as I learned I might have to amputate, I started looking up amputees that play sports, and made the promise that I'd be back on the field,’ Mr Dole told ABC News.

Amazing: Fitted with a carbon fiber blade, Mr Dole is able to play football again

Mr Dole was fitted with a carbon fiber blade below his right knee and he soon set about the long, arduous process rehabbing the leg and learning to walk again while working towards a goal he was told wouldn’t be possible.

‘The doctors told me I'd never play football again and I just always had that in the back of my mind, driving me,’ Mr Dole told ABC News.

The teenager was back wrestling for the school within three months and ran track in the spring, according to ABC News.

After working out all summer to be back in shape, Friday night finally came, Mr Dole was back on the field

All systems go: Mr Dole trained hard to put himself in a position to return to the football field

‘It’s an indescribable feeling… to be back on the field with my teammates and just thinking that my last play was on this field and just to be here, back here again is just an indescribable feeling,’ Mr Dole told GazPrepSports.

The courageous teen’s return wasn’t just for show, he was a force in scoring two touchdowns and recording a sack in his team’s 45-0 victory over Joliet.

‘When a young man works so hard and not even know if he’ll play the game, and to put in the time and effort, I think he deserves it,’ coach Guy Cole told GazPrepSports.

Footage of the game showed Mr Dole playing full tilt. Running, blocking and tackling with ease, even breaking tackles on some plays.

Mr Dole’s parents also heaped praise on their amazing son.

‘I’m very proud of him, and I hope his story will motivate a lot of young athletes around Montana, especially around America,’ Fualelei ‘Andy’ Dole told GazPrepSports.

Reflecting on the past year, Mr. Dole’s mother told GazPrepSports she never doubted he would return to the football field.

‘Just to overcome all this and to be back on the field with my teammates, it's probably the best feeling I've ever had,’ Mr Dole told ABC News.

As if being on the field wasn’t news enough, Montana State – Mr Dole’s dream school – offered him a preferred walk-on scholarship to continue playing football, according to ABC News.
