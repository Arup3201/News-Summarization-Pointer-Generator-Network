A 33-year-old beautician from Essex knows a thing or two about regret after having 'Mummy' tattooed in large letters on her neck to impress her friends. 

Mother-of-two Angela got the inking as a teenager because the boys and girls she was hanging around with at the time all had tattoos on their necks. 

When Angela's mother found out about her plans, she banned her from the tattoo parlour, but the rebellious teen went away anyway... but chose the word 'Mummy' as a sweetener.

Almost instantly, she heavily regretted her decision, and now five years on she is desperate to get the permanent design removed.  

She told Channel 4 show Bodyshockers: 'Within hours I regretted it. I tried to convince myself that I wanted to keep it but I knew straight away it had to go.

'I was rebellious as a teenager, I was hanging around with people at the time who had neck tattoos so I thought they were ok.

'My mum said at the time said I couldn't get one so I had the word 'mummy' etched on so she then she couldn't tell me off.'

Since getting the tattoo, Angela has had two children, which has only furthered her desire to get the inking removed. 

She said: 'At school, I try to cover it up but I don't feel like I don't look like a responsible parent. 

'I have actually avoided going into the school playground before because my hair is up .

'I feel like I look like my children's teenage sister who is still trying to rebel in life.'

Despite the enormous embarrassment that having the tattoo causes Angela, she has been reluctant to undergo the laser treatment that would help to get rid of it. 

But the sharp pain from the lasers isn't preventing her - it is the fact that she can't have continue to use sunbeds while she has treatment. 

She said: 'I know it sounds stupid, but the fact that I can't have a sunbed is a big thing to me. 

'I'm going to be stressed and upset about that because I'm going out and I have no tan. 

'You can't even use fake tan - what am I going to do? It's bad.'

After giving her dilemma some serious consideration, Angela decides to go through with the treatments and ditch her sunbeds. 

The cameras follow her as she visits a salon for the first of her treatments. 

After the session has finished, she tells the TV producers: 'That's really painful, it's like someone is hitting you with a flame that is electrocuting you at the same time.

'I'm glad to have started to get rid of it though. 

'Obviously I'd love to go and have a sunbed because I'm really pale at the moment, but I'm no going to.'
