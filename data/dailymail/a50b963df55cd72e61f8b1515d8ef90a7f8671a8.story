A German newspaper has reported claims President Assad's government inflicted a chemical weapons attack without receiving his personal permission

Syrian government forces pleaded for the use of chemical weapons for four-and-a-half months before an attack was launched on August 21, it has been reported.

A German newspaper claims Syrian brigade and division commanders had been repeatedly denied permission to use the chemicals by President Bashar al-Assad before the attack which claimed more than 1,400 lives.

According to Bild am Sonntag, German spies obtained information which suggested military forces went ahead with the attack without receiving Presidential permission.

The newspaper reported German Intelligence had gained the information while intercepting radio messages aboard a naval vessel that was sailing close to the Syrian coast.

Germany's foreign intelligence agency, BND, could not be reached for comment.

Just last week the head of the BND, Gerhard Schindler, gave confidential briefings to defence and foreign affairs committees, reportedly warning those present the Syrian civil war could last for years to come.

Committee members present at the meeting said Mr Schindler told them although it had no absolute proof, the BND had 'much evidence' to suggest President al-Assad's government was responsible for the attack.

German spies reportedly intercepted a phone call between a Hezbollah official and the Iranian Embassy in Damascus in which the former alleged President al-Assad had ordered the attack.Â 

The German armed forces' chief of staff, General Volker Wiekler also informed lawmakers that ties between Syrian rebels and al-Qaeda linked forces were becoming 'stronger and stronger', it was reported.

Like other European Union members, Germany has blamed the Syrian government for the brutal attack, but has urged waiting for U.N. weapons inspectors' report before encouraging any military response.

In an interview with the same newspaper, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany would not take part in any military intervention but that chemical weapons should not be allowed to be used without a response.

President al-Assad said in an interview filmed this morning he had nothing to do with the attack which claimed the lives of hundreds of children, but that he does claim 'some responsibility'.

Mr al-Assad told interviewer Charlie Rose 'there's not enough evidence to make a conclusive judgment', before alluding Syrian rebel forces were behind the attack.

When asked whether he thought US Congress would vote in favour of a strike, the leader said he didn't know but was 'as prepared as they could be' for military action.

President al-Assad then warned the American people 'it had not been a good experience for them to be involved in the Middle East' in the interview which will be aired in the US on Monday night.

World leaders failed to reach agreement on how to address the situation at a G20 summit held in St Petersburg this weekend.
