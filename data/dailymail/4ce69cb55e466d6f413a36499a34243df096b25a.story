Susanna Reid has been told to lighten her hair, wear brighter clothes, and nod more in a desperate bid to boost viewing figures for Good Morning Britain, it is claimed.

Despite poaching the BBC's star presenter, the ITV breakfast show has seen ratings plummet from 800,000 to 530,000 viewers since it launched in April - fewer than flop Daybreak which it was brought in to replace.

It leaves the programme with just 13 per cent of the audience, falling short of the 15 per cent executives said it needed to survive.

Change: Susanna Reid has been told to soften her look as executives worry it deters female viewers. Dropping her usual bold look (left), the 43-year-old appeared on Friday nodding and giggling in a floral dress (right)

Guidance: In a list of tweaks for the £500,000 presenter, ITV have told her to appear more sympathetic when interviewing - a move she showcased on Friday as she giggled with Peter Andre over croissants and coffee

Now they are hoping some changes can salvage the production.

Pioneering a new, 'laid back' style, Ms Reid greeted viewers from London's South Bank on Thursday wearing a coral dress, with matching shoes and nails.

On Friday, the 43-year-old took the show outdoors once more, sporting a flowery dress, sling-back heels, hoop earrings and sunglasses.

Giggling over croissants and orange juice with co-host Ben Shepherd, Ms Reid nodded intently as she interviewed Peter Andre.

Incredibly, it may have worked, with viewer ratings shooting up by 70,000 on Thursday - a 15.3 per cent share of the audience - and remained steady on Friday.

However, it still trailed behind BBC Breakfast, which holds more than 36 per cent of the audience with 1.5million viewers.

Brighter: On Thursday, Ms Reid debuted the more laid back look, presenting in a pink dress on the riverside. Executives now monitor Ms Reid's skirt length to an nth degree and tell her to nod like Holly Willoughby

Success? Figures suggest the new look has worked after 70,000 more viewers tuned in on Thursday

An ITV source told the Sunday People: 'Susanna has been told to nod more, look more sympathetic and engage.

'Even her dresses are analysed to the nth degree.'

Head of daytime Helen Warner, who is said to be spearheading the changes, has also suggested lightening Ms Reid's hair as most of ITV's top presenters - Holly Willoughby, Anthea Turner, Fiona Phillips - are blonde.

And steps are being taken to soften the interviewer's attitude.

'A lot of people think she's too harsh and intense,' the source told the paper, adding: 'Holly Willoughby is held up as the perfect nodder during interviews and she's as opposite to Susanna as you can get.'

Last chance: ITV bosses are hoping a 'less intense' Susanna can salvage the new production, which has fewer viewers than the flop breakfast show Daybreak - which it was brought in to replace in April

Ms Reid was lured over to Good Morning Britain from BBC Breakfast with £500,000 after winning the nation's hearts on Strictly Come Dancing.

During its launch week, the ITV show had an average of about 690,000 viewers, while BBC Breakfast maintained a steady 1.5million.

But within one month, the figure had plummeted by more than 400,000.

A senior source at ITV admitted that the programme would be unable to continue unless viewers returned.
