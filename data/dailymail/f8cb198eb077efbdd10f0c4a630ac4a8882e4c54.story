Queenslanders have reported seeing a large, flaming ball of light tear through the night sky before crashing to earth near Townsville on Thursday night.

Astronomers are trying to locate the mysterious space object, which had a blue and orange tail and came down in the north Queensland city about 6.30pm (AEST).

Residents from Cunnamulla, in state's southwest, and people located more than 1000km away in Townsville in the north, have reported seeing the object.

Kim Vuga, a 45-year-old public servant, was on the back veranda at her home in the southern Townsville suburb of Kelso when she saw the object hit the earth.

'It was like the sun falling out of the sky with a big flame behind it,' Ms Vuga told MailOnline.

'A big ball of fire which was really bright with the biggest, reddest fire flame behind it.

'It was quite amazing, it was like an atomic bomb effect [when it hit], everything lit back up again.'

Ms Vuga said she knew the exact south-west direction from her home to the spot on earth where it impacted, but she did not know the distance.

'I didn't hear anything so that's another clue as to how far away it was,' she said.

'It's fallen out of the sky into a rural area.'

Townsville resident Terry Robinson said it was an awe-inspiring sight, the ABC reported.

'It was pretty big and this thing hit like a bomb. It was huge,' he told the broadcaster.

'I don't know how big it was. In the sky, it looked like half a dozen jumbo jets were falling out of the sky at the same time.'

Sunshine Coast astronomer Owen Bennedick is trying to locate the object, which he believes is a satellite not a meteor.

'It was probably a satellite re-entering the atmosphere, because of the multiple colours that were seen and how big an area it was actually seen over,' Mr Bennedick told MailOnline.

'It was big so that means it was going slowly.'

Mr Bennedick, from Wappa Falls Observatory in Yandina, said meteors can travel at speeds of up to 100km per second, but satellites only travel between 5km and 7km per second.

He is appealing to witnesses to come forward with information.

'If it actually hit the ground and made a flash then people within I would suggest 5 to 7km would hear it,' he said.

'If it hit the ground it would make a fairly hard bang.'

Police said officers in Townsville had received just one report about the incident, and had made inquiries to ensure it wasn't an aviation accident.

Beyond that, they can't shed any light on the mystery.

Witnesses can contact Mr Bennedick on 0427467944.
