New smile: Holly Merrick, 68, had £30,000 implants in 2012

Holly Merrick, 68, a retired sales manager  from London, had implants in October 2012 after separating from her husband of 15 years. 

She says: ‘Over the decades I have spent thousands on twice-yearly visits to the dentist.

‘Because I have a small jaw, my teeth are overcrowded, causing constant infections.

‘I also had wisdom teeth problems, and two front teeth that came through the same socket.

‘During one visit seven years ago, I had nine teeth removed at once and four bridges, or fake teeth,  fitted in their place.

'It was a nightmare. I learned to  deal with it by grinning, rather than smiling, but the state of my teeth was always on my mind.

‘In 2008, my marriage broke down irreversibly. 

'It was shattering.

'For a  long time I was tearful, before I realised that, as a single woman, I had to take control of myself.

‘In addition to sorting out my finances, and buying my very first car, I decided to sort out my teeth.

'I wanted to feel pretty and proud of myself again.

‘I saw an advert for  United Smile Centres in  the summer of 2012.

'I baulked at the £30,000  cost of implants, before remembering the thousands I’d spent at the dentist throughout my life, and took the money from my savings.

‘A consultation revealed that my teeth were in  such a bad state I’d have  to have all the remaining  ones taken out, but  thanks to the sedative I have no recollection of  the operation.

‘Afterwards I was sore and lived on mashed vegetables for several weeks as my new teeth adjusted. On the bright side, I was delighted to discover I’d lost 9 lb!

‘My final set of teeth were fitted four months later.  I’m thrilled – nobody would ever guess they’re not my own.

'I brush them well and have them polished every six months. I’m still single but love life.

'Last September I even went for  a cruise around the South Pacific on my own, which I’d never have had the confidence to do before.

'Best of all, I can smile at anyone and finally feel attractive again.’
