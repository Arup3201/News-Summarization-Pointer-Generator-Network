Swindled: Thelma Idahosa, 29, from Bromley, south east London, used fake credit cards to pay for a range of cosmetic surgeries at Harley Street clinics

A mother-of-two who used six cloned credit cards to pay for cosmetic surgery at Harley Street clinics has walked free from court after being convicted of fraud.

Thelma Idahosa from Bromley, south east London, spent £8,500 on a number of procedures and even asked for a refund when she complained not enough fat had been removed during a liposuction.

The graduate, 29, forked out thousands for surgeries on her thighs, stomach, arms and ‘love handles’, as well as skin-tightening procedures, using 'stolen credit card details'.

She was given a six-month suspended prison sentence at Woolwich Crown Court and was told she would have been jailed if it had not been for her young children.

She spent £4,000 at the Harley Street Skin Clinic and then purchased £4,500 worth of treatment at the West One Clinic - where she even demanded a £1,000 refund after only three litres of fat was removed instead of six.

Described as 'incredibly rude and aggressive', Idahosa - who was seven months into another suspended sentence at the time of the fraud - she phoned the clinic 'shouting and ranting', threatening to visit and cause a scene.

The company suffered an additional loss after agreeing to refund her two sums of £500.

Prosecutor Mr. Arizuna Asante told the court on Friday: 'Other people’s identity came into play when the cards were preferred for payment. This was fraudulent from the outset and consisted of multiple frauds.'

Idahosa was seven months into a two-year suspended sentence when she committed the frauds in May and June, 2012.

Recorder
 Michael Wood QC told the mother-of-two: 'You really should be going to 
prison.

'There is only one reason you are not and that is because you 
have a relatively young child.

'A sentence of imprisonment that would amount to weeks or months is outweighed by your child’s rights.

'However,
 you can’t hide behind your children forever and if you commit an 
offence within the next two years you will go to prison whether you have
 a babe in arms or are pregnant.'

Convicted: The mother-of-two had liposuction procedures on her stomach arms and 'love handles' using the money from fraudulently obtained credit cards

Idahosa was almost certainly told the same thing when receiving her original suspended sentence seven months before the frauds.

She
 received six months imprisonment, suspended for two years, was placed 
on a two-year supervision order and was told she must also complete 150 hours community service work.

'You are a very, very lucky woman,' Recorder Wood told Idahosa.

Angry: Idahosa demanded a refund from one clinic because they only removed three litres of fat instead of six

Fortunate: Sentencing her at Woolwich Crown Court, Recorder Michael Wood QC told Idahosa she was 'very lucky' to avoid prison, claiming the only reason she was walking from court was because of her children
