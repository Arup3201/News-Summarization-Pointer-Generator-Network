Ollie Proudlock is the much-loved Made in Chelsea style guru who put
crucifix earrings and Hawaiian shirts on the fashion radar.

And now, the 25-year-old with a penchant for top knots has given fans the chance to emulate his style with a brand new jewellery collection.

The fashion designer and reality TV star has teamed up with renowned jeweller Theo Fennell to design a one-off limited edition collection.

Speaking to MailOnline about his new venture, Ollie - also known as Prooders - said: 'Over the past year I have really been focusing on my style blog and collaborating with brands I like.

'I love the quality and detail of Theo's designs so we decided to work together on this collection.

'I am so excited about it and everyone seems to love it.'

The collection, which has been crafted from sterling silver and yellow enamel, combines Theo Fennell’s rock’n’roll aesthetic with Ollie's qurky style and features two of his favourite motifs: the wolf and the feather.

'Feathers are definitely the new crucifix,' said trendsetter Ollie. You heard it here first, MIC fans.

Motif: The range, which is priced between £50-£265, features Proudlock's favourite motifs, the feather and a wolf

Focused: Ollie says he has been working hard on collaborating with designers and keeping his blog, Proudlock Style, up-to-date

Ollie, who describes his personal style as 'laid back, casual and a mix of vintage and contemporary', says he will be dishing out the designs to his Made In Chelsea co-stars...but can Spencer Matthews really pull off a dangly feather?

'My top tip to Spennie would be: don't overdo it and make sure all your jewellery ties in,' said Ollie.

Avid Made In Chelsea fans will be pining for Ollie, who hasn't be on the show as much this season.

'I have various projects on the go but I am still enjoying filming and I do pop up more later on in the series.

'There's a lot of drama and I am a peacemaker. I'm so relaxed and rarely get involved in it all. I am so busy, I just haven't had time.

'I still live with Jamie and Francis, which is awesome, and the whole MIC set is like one big family,' he said.

Ollie, who remains coy about his love life, once had an on-screen 'thing' - as he puts it - with Phoebe-Lettice Thompson.

'We had a little thing but now we are just good friends. She's a really cool girl and has amazing style,' he said.

The Eton-educated reality TV star has instead been focusing on expanding his fashion empire (he's in talks to work on a watch and glasses collection), as well as getting in shape for the Men's Health challenge with Spencer, Andy Jordan and Alex Mytton.

He said: 'We've all been doing the six-pack challenge. Who's got the best abs? Well, you'll just have to wait and see...'

The collection will be available to buy from www.theofennell.com from the end of November 2013.

Sterling Silver & Enamel Dog Tag Pendant: £265

Sterling Silver & Enamel Large Feather Earrings: £195

Sterling Silver & Enamel Feather Ring: £85

While Prooders has been busy designing jewellery for the men of Chelsea, a new company (favoured by MIC star Ashley James) has unveiled something for women.

These enamel bangles by Whistle and Bango have the added quirk of popular London postcodes embossed on each bangle - are you SW11, SW3, N1, W11 OR SW6?
