Newtown residents are being flooded with National Rifle Association robocalls just three months after the town was left devastated by the shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

The automated calls have been urging people to oppose gun control proposals. On December 14, a shooter killed 20 first-graders and six teaching staff in the small Connecticut town.

Residents said the automated calls 
from the NRA began last week and urge people to tell their state 
legislators to oppose gun control proposals.

Some also said they 
received postcards from the NRA supporting gun owners' rights.

'It's
ridiculous and insensitive,' Newtown resident Dan O'Donnell said. 'I 
can't believe an organization would be so focused on the rights of gun 
owners with no consideration for the losses this town suffered.'

Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal slammed the NRA for its thoughtless actions in a blog on ThinkProgress on Monday.

He wrote: 'Their most recent repugnant tactic - repeated robo calls to Newtown families - mocks and betrays the courage and compassion demonstrated by the Newtown community just barely three months after one of the worldâ€™s most horrific acts of gun violence seized 26 beautiful and heroic young lives.'

A message seeking comment was left on Monday at the NRA's headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia.

Like Congress and other state legislatures, Connecticut's General Assembly has been considering gun control measures in the wake of the school shootings, including banning assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.

The NRA strongly opposes many gun 
control proposals including an assault weapons ban, saying government 
officials should better enforce existing gun laws and not impede on 
people's Second Amendment rights.

Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, has said his organization supports getting the records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent and dangerous into the background check system for gun dealers and beefed up penalties for illegal third-party purchases and gun trafficking.

Shortly after the Newtown shooting, LaPierre also called for armed security guards in schools.

A 20-year-old gunman killed 26 students and educators and himself at Sandy Hook on December 14, after having shot his mother to death at their Newtown home.

Another Newtown resident, Christopher Wenis, said that he received three of the NRA's robocalls last week.

'I've got a five-year-old son who went to preschool on the Sandy Hook Elementary School campus,' Wenis said.

'And this was a really hard week for me on a lot of levels. These calls were the very last thing I needed.'
