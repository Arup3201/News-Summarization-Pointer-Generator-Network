This week sees London packed with tattoo events, launches and concept exhibitions, as the London Tattoo Convention - arguably the best in the world - arrives in the capital.

One such event was the world's first human gallery of tattoos in Soho's Riflemaker gallery last night,  curated by two of the biggest names in the art, Cally-Jo and Lal Hardy.

The pair searched far and wide for people with the world's greatest tattoos, and last night their work came together when a mix of vibrantly inked individuals came together in London to create a human gallery.

Tattoos on show represented a wide breadth of styles, large scale body pieces, intricate sleeves and neck pieces inspired by traditional Japanese paintings, cubism and old romantic artworks. 

The human canvases were displayed in hanging frames normally associated with oil paintings at The Riflemaker in Soho for four hours, and revellers were treated to canapés and whisky. 

New entertainment channel truTV commissioned the event to celebrate the second season of tattoo competition reality show Ink Master, hosted by Dave Navarro.

The programme sees tattoo artists go head to head in a series of challenges to prove their skills and to be crowned the ultimate Ink Master - a bit like the Great British Bake Off but with tatts instead of tarts.

FEMAIL caught up with Cally-Jo Pothecary, 24, who tattooed Rihanna's hand, and legendary tattooist, Lal Hardy, ahead of the launch.

Lal Hardy said: 'Many of the practitioners involved in the project are the Rembrandts, Van Gogh's and Titians of the skin embellishment world. 

'There's no better way to celebrate the ink masters of the modern era than at the opening of the art gallery of skin.'

A spokesperson for Turner Broadcasting said: 'We are seeing a growing popularity in the UK for shows where contestants are pitted against each other in a series of challenges to become the ultimate master in their field. truTV's Ink Master combines this increasingly popular format with the UK public's growing obsession with tattoos.

Our Ink Master Human Gallery is a celebration of this, and a chance to observe the beauty of human inking with the same respect as its oil, watercolour and pencil counterparts.'

These days with everyone from Rihanna to David Beckham covered in tattoos, many are still waiting for the right moment.

Leading artist Cally-Jo, 24, says don't dwell on waiting for that right 'meaning' or pivotal point in your lift for which to mark you body, and instead pick something that looks nice.

She encourages you to think of it as a timeless piece of clothing that's tailored beautifully and suits you - compared to something emotional such as a must-have item that you may go off in a few months.

'I don't think it has to be a major moment [in your life] at all,' she tells MailOnline.

'Choose an image you're going to be happy to wear forever. Meanings are not going to stay. None of mine have meanings, apart from the portrait of my grandma.

'I blame this notion on shows like Miami Ink. They want to use people with interesting stories because it makes good TV, but you have to really like the design. Also,  the tattoo won't take 10 seconds.

'In terms of what makes a good tattoo, I'm looking for longevity. If too small, it wont last. It needs to be something that will last forever. Clean, bold lines and smooth shading...

'Rihanna has good tattoos, Cara Delevingne does also, but does have some weird ones. David Beckham has some beautiful tattoos.'

Cally-Jo has a  long waiting list of eager clients, but she's only been in the business three years.

'I've been a fine artist for a long time and did art training for six years before I started tattooing,' she says.

As well as pure determination, being motivated and grabbing every opportunity; Cally-Jo credits social media and consequently celebrity clients with raising her profile.

'Rihanna was pretty big news - especially as it's on her hand, her entire hand.' 

She recommends those hoping to follow in her footsteps remember it's important to stay humble and not let things get to your head, and to also use the internet and social media, which is 'so huge'.

Cally-Jo helped adapt Rihanna's Maori tribal tattoo, which was originally inked painfully in the traditional  way

'The best platform is Instagram,' she says. 'Most people follow at least one [tattooist].

'I started Instagram a couple of years ago and it kind of blew up from there, I suddenly had hundreds of thousands of followers - one of which happened to be Rihanna. She knew of my work anyway and she contacted a friend of mine in the shop I was working in [Bang Bang Tattoo in New York City's Lower East Side].'

Rihanna flew Cally-Jo and Keith McCurdy 1,500 miles to the Dominican Republic to adapt her tribal New Zealand tattoo.

'She had [the original design] done as a spur of the moment thing; and she was freaking out about it... I tattooed her entire hand. She wanted a henna style tattoo and after looking at lots of styles I drew it on free hand.' 

Many of the practitioners involved in the project are the best of the best in the skin embellishment world

Lal is a tattooing legend who has tattooed numerous footballers including Jack Wiltshire, as well as musicians like Dave Grohl and Liam Gallagher, and has been in the business for more than 35 years. He ran a trade magazine for 15 years, has had four books published, and has always spoken up for the trade. But then there's also the personal level through which he connects to the art - at his shop.

'I'm really lucky that I've got the gift of the gab, an old school tattooist is usually a bit of a showman and a chameleon with people,' he tells MailOnline.

'Sometimes a bit of a lairy lad taking about to football, and then I'm also there for a client if their kid's died; I can sit there and be with them while they're in tears. That's the experience of coming here.

'[My shop] is in the middle of nowhere in Muswell Hill, but people from all over the world come here.' 

Lal says the fear of the unknown has been taken away by celebrity culture. Now that so many people want to brave their first inking, he recommends researching the artist thoroughly. And while he considers the look more important that the meaning, he does rate personal, poignant tattoos.

'There's always the skin of the artist which is important. You've got to research them. If you've got an artist that's not skilful he won't be able to create a nice piece of work on the person. The aesthetic should please them. A tattoo is good if the person is really happy with it. I like tattoos to look good and to be executed nicely.

'One of my favourite pieces that I've done is a whole Japanese body suit,' says Lal of this piece on display

'But at the same time, I really love when tattoos have a meaning to them - I don't mean they see a programme where someone gets three stars and say 'they represent my family' and just copy that...

'For example, a guy came in recently who was retiring and he wanted to get his business card on his chest - that was quite unique...

'One of my favourite pieces that I've done on someone is a whole Japanese body suit - flowers dragons the lot. I love that tattoo... Favourites change through the years, though. Sometimes they're on people you've got a great friendship with.

'My favourite tattoo that I've got is in the centre of my chest that I got done in Yokohama by the greatest tattoo artist in the world, Horiyoshi III, almost 25 years ago. 

'As I once said, "In the diary of life, tattoos are inky memories".'

Season two of Ink Master premieres on October 3 at 9pm on truTV, channel 68.
