A violent, serial rapist is scheduled to be released into a California college town despite admitting to sexually assaulting 40 women in the state.

Christopher Evans Hubbart, 62, was approved for release in May by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Gilbert Brown.

He was due to be released from jail in 1996 after spending the best part of 24 years locked up for sex crimes but failed psychological testing and was committed to Coalinga state hospital.

Predator: Christopher Evans Hubbart, 62, is due to be released from a state hospital in southern California in November after being convicted of 41 rapes

The LA District Attorney has vowed to fight the judge's decision to release Hubbart in November into the town where he was born and raised as he no longer has family there.

In a statement, DA Jackie Lacey said: 'Our ultimate goal is to seek justice for all residents of Los Angeles County and make sure sexually violent predators remain in custody.

'This inmate has a long history of horrific violence against women and we must act to keep our community safe.'

DA Lacey added: 'If these crimes were committed today, this inmate's release would not be in question. Today's violent sexual predators face life in prison.'

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Judge Brown.

The decision to conditionally release Hubbart has been made by a panel of mental health experts at the state hospital.

Hubbart has admitted to raping 41 
women in California from 1971 to 1982 - more than half of which were 
committed in the county where he is due to be released.

He was first convicted in 1972 at the age of 21 of sodomy, rape and burglary in LA County.

When he was released in 1979, he moved to the Bay area and attacked 15 more women.

Hubbart attacked women at the rate of two victims a month until he was caught less two years later.

He was sentenced to 16 years in 1982 for false imprisonment, rape and forced oral copulation.

He was allowed out on parole eight years later and within two months had attacked a jogger.

He was sent back to jail until 1996 before being committed under new legislation that allowed sexually violent individuals to be monitored in state hospitals.

Small town: Claremont in southern California is home to seven colleges attended by 6,300 students

Authorities are
currently looking for a location where Hubbart can live. As part of his
release, the 62-year-old must wear an ankle bracelet, attend counseling
and allow police to search his home.

Claremont is a town of 35,000 residents, situated to the east of LA county in California. 

It
is home to the Claremont Colleges - made up of five undergraduate and 
two graduate schools - grouped together within roughly one square mile 
and attended by 6,300 students.
