He's been taking daisies and a few pennies to a bench in Wisconsin every day for the past two years to honor his late wife.

But after snow blanketed the walkway to the seating area in a Fond Du Lac park it looked as though Bud Caldwell, 82, would have to stop his daily routine.

That was until two kind strangers stepped in and decided to shovel the snow-covered walkway.

Love: Bud Caldwell, 82, has been taking daisies and a few pennies to a bench in Wisconsin every day for years to honor his late wife

Devotion: Caldwell bought and dedicated the bench to his late wife, Betty, after she died two years ago

Marriage: Caldwell and his wife spent nearly 56 years together and he has found comfort in his daily routine since she passed away

Jerrod Ebert and Joe Smaltz, two Fond Du Lac park employees said that they spotted the 82-year-old sitting in his car staring at the bench because he could not get to it.

And realizing that he was stranded, they decided to shovel the walkway and keep the path clear all through winter.

The employees said that they did it so that the romantic could visit the spot he bought and dedicated to his late wife, Betty, after she died two years ago. 

Ebert said: 'We both commented that we just can't have this. We've got to make sure he can get to his bench and talk to his wife.'

'We did it only because of his love for his wife. He truly misses her.' 

Caldwell and his wife spent nearly 56 years together and he has found comfort in his daily routine since she passed away.

Help: Jerrod Ebert, left, and Joe Smaltz, right, two Fond Du Lac park employees decided to shovel the walkway and keep the path clear all through winter

Thanks: Caldwell is truly grateful for the park employees gesture he said it was a 'nice thing for an old man'

He told CBS 58 News: 'A lot of people might think it's a dumb thing. But I don't.'

In fact it is the best part of his day.

'Good morning dear,' he says as he approaches her bench with her picture on it.

And come rain or shine he makes sure that he is there to spend time remembering his dearly departed wife.

The gifts that he leaves - the daisies and the pennies - are both tributes to songs the couple loved during their years together: 'Daisy a Day,' and 'Pennies From Heaven.'  

So, Caldwell is truly grateful for the park employees gesture.

He said with pride: 'Two young men did such a nice thing for an old man.'

He then ends his daily trip by telling his wife: 'See you later munchkin' and kisses the picture of Betty  as he walks away.
