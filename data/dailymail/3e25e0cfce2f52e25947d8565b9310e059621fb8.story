Pets were brought to churches across Europe today to received a special blessing to celebrate the patron saint of animals.

Pigs, chickens, horses, cats, dogs and even two terrapins headed to services to be anointed by priests.

The Vatican in Rome was filled as an array of animals queued in St Peter's Square to mark the feast of St. Anthony the Abbot, the 
third-century holy man who is the Catholic Church's patron of animals - a title shared with St Francis of Assisi.

Farmers, ranchers and breeders brought their animals to the square for a blessing by Cardinal Angelo Comastri, the archpriest of St. Peter's Basilica.

Comastri also said a Mass inside the church for the humans - the animals waited outside.
