Named: One of the alleged abusers was named as violin teacher Chris Ling, photographed in California where he moved after a police investigation in 1991

Two more former staff at the music school attended by abuse victim Frances Andrade were facing a police probe last night.

The mother of four killed herself following a cross-examination by the barrister for Michael Brewer, a teacher who assaulted her at Chetham’s.

Three more women have told police they were sexually abused as pupils at the Manchester school.

One of the alleged abusers was named as violin teacher Chris Ling, who moved to California after a police investigation in 1991.

Police have been given details of at least six women who claim that – when they were 15 or younger – Mr Ling would make them play their instrument naked, smack their bare bottoms to punish them, and buy them lingerie.

At least one of the former Chetham’s students who has directly contacted police is understood to have made allegations against a third teacher, in addition to Brewer and Mr Ling.

Brewer, who spent nearly 20 years as director of music at Chetham’s – and his ex-wife Kay, both 68 – were last week convicted of indecently assaulting Mrs Andrade while she was studying at the exclusive school. The jury were not informed until after returning their verdicts that the 48-year-old had taken a fatal overdose part way through the trial.

Her family say she was traumatised by a gruelling cross-examination in which she was branded a liar and a fantasist. They want Brewer to be stripped of his OBE. He and his wife are awaiting sentence.

Mr Ling, 55, is understood to have joined Chetham’s as a violin teacher in the early 1980s where his close relationship with his pupils reportedly saw Brewer refer to the girls as ‘Ling’s Strings’.

He is married to a former pupil, Pippa Clarke, who is a concert violinist.

But according to Press reports in 1991, Mr Ling faced a five-month police probe into allegations of sexual abuse of girls aged 16 at Chetham’s.

No action is understood to have been taken, although neither the Crown Prosecution Service nor Greater Manchester Police have traced files on what happened.

Mr Ling had by then moved to the US 
where he now lives in a £1.6million home in an exclusive area of Sherman
Oaks in Los Angeles. He works as a classical music agent.

Assault: Michael Brewer - who spent nearly 20 years as director of music at Chetham's - and his ex-wife Kay were convicted of indecently assulating Francis Andrade while she was studying at the exclusive school

At the weekend he told a reporter he had no comment to make on the allegations.

Asked about the claims as she walked her
dog near their home last night, Mr Ling’s wife said: ‘There’s no 
comment being made at the moment.’

Victim: Mother-of-four Frances Andrade killed herself following a cross-examination by the barrister for Brewer, who assaulted her at Chetham's

Yesterday Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police, said his officers had been given a list of potential victims by the Guardian newspaper following their own investigation.

He added: ‘In addition to this, several people have also come forward directly to police. 

‘We will be affording them, and anyone else who comes forward, all the appropriate time and support.’ Chetham’s school has stressed it has put strict child protection measures in place.

The police handling of the Brewer case could deter rape victims from coming forward,  Theresa May said last night.

The
Home Secretary promised to see if any lessons could be learned from the
tragedy, which has sparked widespread alarm at Westminster. ‘This whole
question of how the police deal with rape cases is one that is being 
looked at,’ she added. ‘We all recognise that one of the issues here is 
the difficulty victims feel in coming forward.’

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper 
said Mrs Andrade was ‘let down by the criminal justice system whose job 
it was to help and protect her’.

Academics have called for an inquiry into claims that sexual abuse was rife at leading music schools in the 1970s and 80s.
