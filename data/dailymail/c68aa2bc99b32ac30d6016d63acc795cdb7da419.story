Pro-Russian separatists claimed to have found the 'black box' - which records vital flight information - of the downed passenger airliner MH17.

According to Russian news agency Interfax, First Deputy Prime Minister Andriy Purgin of the breakaway Donestsk Republic said the box will be transferred to Moscow for examination.

'Of course, we most likely will give them to the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC), to Moscow. They are highly qualified experts who will be able to accurately determine the cause of the disaster, even though it is so clear,' he said.

Destroyed: An armed pro-Russian separatist stands at a site of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 plane crash in the settlement of Grabovo in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. It is claimed the flight's black box has been recovered and will be sent to Moscow

Whoever has the black box will be able to control what information is released from on board before the crash.

Black boxes are used to review information from the flight and record cockpit chatter. They allow officials to discover if the pilot was aware of any problems before the plane went down.

Meanwhile, armed separatists are hindered search efforts at the crash site, the head of Ukraine's emergency services said.

'The search work is difficult because we are talking about a big radius... but also because armed terrorists who are on the spot are hampering things,' Serhiy Bochkovsky told journalists. He gave no further details.

Power: It is believed a BUK missile launcher brought down the Boeing 777

The Malaysian airliner was brought down over eastern Ukraine on Thursday, killing all 295 people aboard and sharply raising the stakes in a conflict between Kiev and pro-Moscow rebels in which Russia and the West back opposing sides.

Among the dead are nine Britons and 27 Australians, according to Dutch authorities, and fears of up to 23 Americans.

Any commercial aeroplane or corporate jet is required to be equipped with a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data recorder.

It is these two items of separate equipment which we commonly refer to as a ‘black box.’

While they do nothing to help the plane when it is in the air, both these pieces of equipment are vitally important should the plane crash, as they help crash investigators find out what happened just before.

All recorders undergo countless tests, are able to operate between -55° to +70°C and carry a minimum 25 hours of flight data.

Also, to help investigators find them, a black box is not actually black at all, but bright orange.

Ukraine accused 'terrorists' - militants fighting to unite eastern Ukraine with Russia - of shooting down the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 with a heavy, Soviet-era ground-to-air missile as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.

Meanwhile, a Ukrainian newspaper published the transcript of a phone call reportedly intercepted by Ukraine’s security services where rebels are heard discussing finding MH17's wreckage.

One, dubbed Major' tells another with the codename 'Greek' it was '100 per cent a passenger (civilian) aircraft'.

Greek asked: 'What kind of aircraft?' to which Major responded: 'I haven’t ascertained this. I haven’t been to the main site.

'I am only surveying the scene where the first bodies fell. There are the remains of internal brackets, seats and bodies.'

Greek: 'Is there anything left of the weapon?'

'Major': 'Absolutely nothing. Civilian items, medicinal stuff, towels, toilet paper.'

Greek: 'Are there documents?'

Major: 'Yes, of one Indonesian student. From a university in Thompson.'
