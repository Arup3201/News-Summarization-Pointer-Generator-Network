Kelly McManus is describing the 'hell' she endured before she had her controversial £5,000 tummy tuck on the NHS when her mobile phone rings.

No regrets: Kelly says her NHS tummy tuck, which took her down a dress size, has made her confident

It’s a radio station wanting to interview the 27-year-old single mum-of-three about the operation. Would she be free for a chat on air tonight?

'You’ll have to speak to my agent,' says the part-time beauty consultant, reeling off the contact details before hanging up and rolling her eyes in mock indignation. 'It’s all gone a bit mad,' she giggles. 

The thousands on waiting lists for life-saving NHS treatment will certainly agree. The taxpayer, too, may wonder who in their right mind would sanction a wannabe actress having a state-funded operation because a saggy stomach was affecting her chances of stardom. 

Kelly, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, is unrepentant. The slim brunette, who wants to be the next Julia Roberts, says she needed the operation because it was affecting her confidence. 

What’s more, she believes it saved the NHS money because she will not now need treatment for depression. Yes, you heard that right. 

'As a long-term patient because I was so depressed, the NHS would have probably ended up spending more money on my medication,' she says. 

Perhaps the truly depressing aspect of this tale is its familiarity. Kelly’s story closely resembles that of Josie Cunningham, a 23-year-old wannabe model, who had breast enlargement surgery that cost the NHS £4,800. 

Five months later, she decided she didn’t like her new breasts and wanted them reducing — also at the taxpayers’ expense.

With an astonishing lack of self-awareness, Josie has hit out at Kelly for wasting taxpayers’ money, while insisting her own operation was justified.

'I’m not going to apologise,' Kelly says at the three-bedroom home she shares with her children, Shania, six, Teyha, four, and two-year-old Rio.

She separated from their father, who she will only name as Ryan, 12 months ago after seven years together. He is helping to look after the children today. 

'I don’t make the decisions about who does and does not get surgery — that’s up to the doctors and surgeons. It’s not my fault if people with other conditions aren’t treated properly,' she says.

‘It has been really hard for me. I felt so self-conscious. Friends would ask me to go out and I’d say no because I couldn’t find clothes to fit. I could only get into a size ten [she’s now a size eight].

'I had no confidence. I didn’t feel comfortable getting undressed in front of Ryan, and I felt too self-conscious to have sex with him.

Controversial: Kelly's decision caused a media furore but she remains unrepentant

'Other people said my stomach didn’t look too bad, but I thought it looked awful. People asked me how far on I was with my pregnancy when I wasn’t even pregnant. It was embarrassing.'

Feeling embarrassed by a post-pregnancy muffin top is something thousands of mothers will relate to, but few will resort to anything as drastic as a tummy tuck. Even then, most would expect to pay for it privately.

Kelly says this was never an option. On her £7,000 salary plus child benefits and working tax credits, it would, she says, have 'taken years' to save up. Instead, the NHS stepped in.

'I didn’t even know an op would help me until the doctor referred me to a surgeon,' she says. Kelly’s mother passed away at the age of 52. She claims her council worker father and three brothers and two sisters support her decision to have surgery. 

'My family know how badly it affected my confidence,' she says. 

Kelly left school at 16 with ten GCSEs, but dropped out of college and became a waitress. She gave that up when she got pregnant with her daughter, aged 21. 

Now, like so many of The X Factor generation who think a large cleavage and flat stomach are the route to success regardless of talent, Kelly has big plans.

'My ambition is to write and perform my own songs,' she says. 'I’d like to be the next Alicia Keys. I did drama and singing at school and won competitions. I auditioned for The X Factor in 2008, but I didn’t get through.

'After I had my children I gave up my dream. Now? I’d like to take acting and singing lessons — I really may be the next Julia Roberts!'

Kelly first noticed the changes in  her body after the birth of her first child. 'I knew when I had Shania my body would change, but I didn’t realise how much.

'I remember lying in the bath after I’d had her and my tummy looked lumpy. I thought it would get better with time, but it didn’t. I tried to get rid of it by going to the gym three times a week, but it made no difference.'

She says: 'It was only after I’d had Rio that my midwife said my stomach muscles had separated and I might need to see the GP. I had backache because my stomach muscles weren’t supporting me. I visited my GP several times and told him I felt very low. It was affecting my social life, too.'

Outrage: Aspiring model Josie Cunningham caused controversy when she had a boob job on the NHS

Looking at pictures of Kelly’s stomach before surgery, it is difficult to see what she is complaining about. Having given birth to twins a year ago, I would be very happy to swap figures.

Kelly’s GP referred her to a physiotherapist, who gave her exercises to improve her posture.

'For a while they helped my backache, but when I asked her if they would help pull my muscles back into shape, she said no. I would need surgery for that.

'When I looked in the mirror I just saw a fat belly and loose skin. I wore looser clothing to cover it, but underneath I felt ugly. The doctors referred me to a surgeon, but I didn’t think I’d get it free.'

Kelly was sent to the Bradford Royal Infirmary, where it was agreed she would have a tummy tuck on the NHS. 

A spokesperson for NHS Greater Huddersfield Clinical Commissioning Group said they would not comment on individual cases, adding: 'Decisions to fund treatments are made after extensive inquiries with the patient’s GP and through careful and sympathetic discussion of all the available facts.'

'I was terrified in the weeks leading up to the operation,' says Kelly. 'I wondered what would happen if I didn’t wake up. I didn’t want to leave my children without their mum.

'But then I thought that in the long term the children would benefit because they’d have a much happier mum.'

The three-hour operation to remove excess skin from Kelly’s stomach went ahead on July 23, and she says the boost to her confidence was immediate.

'As soon as I got undressed for the first time, I felt so much better about my body,' she says.

'The surgeon, who had made a vertical cut around four inches long up to my belly button, said the operation had gone well. People might wonder why I’m not self-conscious about having a big scar since I was self-conscious about a big tummy, but at least underwear can cover a scar.'

Kelly says the operation has 'transformed' her life, and believes nothing stands between her and her new career. She has already made her TV debut.

'I was on the Jeremy Kyle show a few years ago, but I don’t really want to talk about why,' she says. 'I’m going on Daybreak, too — I’d like to do more TV. I’ve not been offered any modelling and I’ve got quite a few tattoos, so I don’t know if that would be possible. But if the chance came along to do something classy — not topless — I’d think about it.

'Celebrities have such glamorous lives. They can buy whatever they want. It can’t be all it’s cracked up to be, though. I’ve only been famous for five minutes and am already getting loads of calls. It’s been a bit of a nightmare.'

And the radio interview? 'Don’t know if I can be bothered,' she says. 'I’ve got a party to go to.' And a flat tummy to show off — paid for, dear reader, by you.
