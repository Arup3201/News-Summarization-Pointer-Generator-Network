Andrew Gale is still in big trouble for the outburst that has overshadowed Yorkshire’s championship triumph and faces a lengthy ban even though the man he abused does not consider the attack to be racist.

The Yorkshire captain faces a disciplinary hearing this week with the ECB’s resolve to take the matter extremely seriously as strong as ever even though Ashwell Prince appeared to clear Gale of racially abusing him on Friday.

Gale was banned for the rest of the season and was unable to lift the championship trophy after telling Prince to ‘f*** off back to your own country you Kolpak f*****’ in a highly-charged Roses match at Old Trafford earlier this month.

Now, in a further twist, it has emerged that it was Prince’s Lancashire team-mate Usman Khawaja who reported the incident to umpires Steve Garrett and Steve O’Shaugnessy rather than the South African.

Khawaja, Lancashire’s Australian overseas player, was batting at the time with Prince and, Sportsmail can reveal, was the leading figure in taking the case further than the Level Two charge originally brought by the umpires for dissent.

It was taken up by Alan Fordham, who is charge of discipline in the professional game for the ECB, and Gale’s future will this week be determined by a disciplinary commission chaired by the respected Gerard Elias QC.

It was Elias who decided that Gale had a case to answer on racial grounds because he used what is considered the inflammatory phrase ‘f*** off back to your own country.’ The use of the term Kolpak, an overseas player who can play without restriction like Prince, bears no part in the hearing and is not considered insulting.

Sportsmail understands that Gale has not helped his case by showing no contrition and there has been no sign of any apology either from Yorkshire, who have vowed to back their man to the hilt legally if necessary.

Yet with Gale, 30, being a serial offender in dissent cases he could be facing a long spell on the sidelines if found guilty by Elias and his commission this week.
