The BBC is investigating allegations that one of its presenters was involved in a ‘vicious and unrelenting cyber-bullying campaign’ that contributed to the death of a 47-year-old man.

Murray Norton, who has been a BBC broadcaster for nearly 30 years, strongly denies making offensive comments on social networking sites about Simon Abbott, a computer software developer who died of a heart attack earlier this year.

Mr Norton is said to have posted messages on Facebook and Twitter suggesting Mr Abbott was a conman, siphoning off charity donations for his own use.

The alleged abuse encouraged dozens 
of ‘internet trolls’ to join in the harassment, some allegedly claiming 
they were taking their cue from Mr Norton because of his status as a BBC
 broadcaster.

Police have said they were not aware of any evidence Mr Abbott was misappropriating funds.His father believes the alleged bullying hastened his son’s death.

And
 last night The Mail on Sunday discovered that the extent to which 
stress may have contributed to Mr Abbott’s heart attack will be 
considered at the forthcoming inquest.

In
 his spare time Mr Abbott ran a charitable foundation he set up in 
memory of his sister Samantha, who committed suicide in 2009 while 
suffering from post-natal depression.

Before
 his death in June, he had begun libel proceedings against  Mr Norton 
and other people whose false allegations, he claimed, had destroyed his 
reputation and turned him into a recluse, unable to work and frightened 
to leave his house.  A defence was lodged denying all  the claims.

However,
 his father, Jon Abbott, believes the alleged comments were posted by Mr
 Norton and others and is demanding to know why BBC bosses apparently 
made no attempt to stop Mr Norton spreading unfounded rumours about his 
son.

The
 retired journalist, who lives in South Africa, said: ‘Simon’s schemes 
failed to raise any money, partly due to his own shortcomings as a 
charity organiser and partly because it was an impossible task to make a
 success of any project that kept being slated on the internet.

‘The
 takings (for the trust) appear to have been pitiful. When he died, 
there was little money in his  bank account and the trust was £1,400 in 
the red. That doesn’t make him a conman.

‘It is deplorable for the BBC to stand on the sidelines. Norton was working for a national institution funded by the British taxpayer and was very much in the public eye.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We offer our sincere condolences to Mr Abbott but strongly assert the BBC has treated the complaints in question seriously. No evidence of cyber-bullying was found and the complaint was not upheld.’

One of the online messages, purportedly written by the radio host, allegedly said: ‘Simon, if you are reading this – which, my friends, he might be – give it up, come clean on the finances of the trust, put the items you claim to have from the famous to good use.I’ll auction them for some people in real need instead of false events that help no one.’

One of Mr Abbott’s tormentors, a woman from Cornwall, was questioned by police after he complained about her behaviour in November 2011. She was ‘given advice’ by officers but not charged with any offence.

But when Mr Abbott’s father wrote to the BBC after his son’s death, the managing editor of BBC Radio Jersey, Jon Gripton, said that since  Mr Norton was a ‘freelance artist’, the corporation had no responsibility for his off-air activities.

Mr Norton’s links with the BBC, however, are long-established and he hosts a three-hour show on Radio Jersey every weekday morning.

Simon Abbott said in a court statement relating to his libel action: ‘People think I am a conman, dishonest, and even that I have made up the death of my sister. Because he (Norton) works for the BBC everyone follows he (sic) and joins in.’

Jon Abbott’s complaint against Mr Norton is now being re-examined by one of the BBC’s most senior executives, David Holdsworth.

Mr Norton combines his broadcasting career with running two restaurants in Jersey. Our calls to him went unanswered.
