'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' has already grossed $771,484,011 in the few weeks since its release, while animated comedy sequel Monsters University rounded out the top five with $743,559,607, according to Box Office Mojo.

In its domestic debut last month, 'The Hunger Games' sequel set a U.S. and Canadian record for November's ticket sales, hauling in $161.1 million and a total of $307.7 million around the world.

But again, 'Iron Man 3' topped the charts,
 as the biggest film debut with $174.1 million domestically – the 
fourth-biggest domestic film opening in history.

The third place for 'Fast 
& Furious 6' is bitter sweet, coming just weeks after star Paul 
Walker was tragically killed in a car accident.

Production
 company Universal Pictures recently revealed that some of the profits 
from DVD sales of the new movie will go to Walker’s international 
charity Reach Out.

Production on the seventh instalment has also come to
 a halt while the cast and crew attempt to salvage the upcoming summer 
feature.

The film was 
on an accelerated schedule of filming in an effort to release the 
feature in time for the summer movie season. The seventh installment of 
the action film franchise was originally set for July 11, 2014.

It is highly unlikely that the film will maintain that summer release date.

Blockbusters
 'Man of Steel', 'Gravity,' 'Thor: The Dark World,' 'The Croods' and 'World War Z' completed the top ten in the highest-grossing film list.

It seems Downey Jr. has found a winning formula with Marvel’s 'Iron Man,' since his role as playboy billionaire Tony Stark has made him the best paid actor in Hollywood with estimated earnings of $75 million.

Thanks to 2012 superhero team-up movie, 'The Avengers,' 'Iron Man' has also became the highest-earning superhero on the big screen of all time, raking in a combined figure of $3.8 billion.

The huge success of high-grossing winners such as 'Iron Man 3' and 'Fast & Furious 6' have managed to offset the year’s high-profile flops including 'The Lone Ranger,' 'After Earth,' 'R.I.P.D.' and 'Turbo'.

Hollywood is expected to have a banner year at the domestic box office, coming in just shy of $11 billion, the largest annual take ever.

But because of higher ticket prices, actual attendance at North American theaters remained flat after a decade of decline.

With the current domestic box-office tally nearly 1 per cent ahead of last year at this time, 2013 could surpass 2012's overall haul of $10.8 billion by more than $100 million, according to box-office tracker Rentrak.
