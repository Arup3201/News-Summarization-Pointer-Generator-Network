A Royal Marine sergeant was caught on camera ‘executing’ a severely injured Taliban prisoner before telling his comrades: ‘I’ve just broken the Geneva Convention,’ a court martial heard yesterday.

As the insurgent lay stricken with horrendous wounds from a helicopter strike, the 37-year-old commando pointed his 9mm pistol at the man’s chest and pulled the trigger.

Footage of the alleged cold-blooded killing in an Afghan cornfield was captured in graphic video inadvertently filmed by one of the Marines on a helmet-mounted camera.

The sergeant then taunted the dying man, who twitched and convulsed as he gasped his final breaths, by telling him: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***,’ it is claimed.

Yesterday dramatic images and audio recordings of the ‘field execution’ were played to a court martial where three commandos – known only as Marines A, B and C – stand accused of murder.

The men, who have been granted anonymity to protect them from any reprisals, deny the charges. It is the first case of its kind for British troops involved in the Afghan campaign.

Prosecutors told the seven-strong military jury that Marine A killed the wounded insurgent after his unit seized him on September 15, 2011. Marines B and C ‘encouraged and assisted’ him, the hearing was told

David Perry QC said the Taliban 
fighter was ‘harmless and posed no danger’. He added: ‘This was not a 
killing in the heat or exercise of armed conflict. The prosecution case 
is that it amounted to a field execution – the execution of a man who 
was entitled to be treated with dignity and respect.’

The
court martial, which took place under tight security at Bulford 
military court centre in Wiltshire, was told the shooting followed an 
attack on a British checkpoint in Helmand province.

A surveillance blimp showed two insurgents launching an assault against the remote outpost with assault rifles.

An Apache helicopter gunship was sent from Camp Bastion, Britain’s main base in Afghanistan, and fired 139 rounds from its 30mm cannon.

The
aircrew believed the man targeted ‘simply could not have survived’ the 
fearsome barrage, so the three Marines were sent on a ‘battle damage 
assessment’ patrol.

The
trio – who all served with 42 Commando – discovered the severely 
wounded man lying in a field, armed with an old AK-47 assault rifle, two
magazines of ammunition and a hand grenade.

Six minutes of film footage recorded 
on Marine B’s helmet was played to the trial, showing the unit 
approaching the stricken man and calling him a ‘f****** p****’, ‘c***’ 
and ‘b******’.

As they 
reach the Afghan, he is lying on the ground, covered in blood, wearing 
white robes and no shoes. Marine A used his radio to report that the 
enemy was still alive. The non-commissioned officer, with 13 years’ 
service in the military, then ordered his men to move the prisoner out 
of sight of cameras on the surveillance blimp.

The
injured man was dragged into a wooded area nearby. Marine A asked: 
‘Anybody want to give first aid to this idiot?’ Another voice quickly 
replied: ‘Nope’.

Marine C offered to shoot him in the head, sparking laughter. But Marine A rejects the idea as ‘that would be f****** obvious’.

As the men discuss killing their prisoner, Marine B is seen reaching up to the helmet camera and telling his comrades: ‘Let’s switch this f****r off.’

But a short time later, he switched the camera back on. In extraordinary footage, one Marine is heard saying, ‘F***’s sake, I can’t believe we are doing this.’

Seconds later, Marine A is filmed kneeling next to the man, putting his pistol to his chest and firing.

The victim is seen convulsing and struggling after the shot. Marine A then says: ‘There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.’

He then turns to his comrades and says: ‘Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere, fellas. I’ve just broken the Geneva Convention.’ Marine B replies: ‘Roger. If it ever comes to light, it was just a warning shot.’

The patrol can be heard reporting back that the fighter had died of wounds inflicted by the gunship.

Part of the footage came to light  in September 2012 when police searched a laptop following the arrest of another Marine on an unrelated matter. The images of the alleged murder were discovered a few weeks later following expert analysis.

Mr Perry said: ‘It was obvious that they were intent upon killing their detainee, who at the time of the killing was harmless and who posed no danger to the defendants.

‘At its most basic the prosecution case is this: Marine A – using a pistol – deliberately shot and killed an injured man. Although Marine A fired the gun at close range into the injured man’s chest and caused his death, the prosecution case is that Marines B and C were also party to his killing. The video footage clearly speaks for itself and shows the execution of a severely injured man.’

Prosecutor David Perry QC told the board at the Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire, that Marine B filmed the incident on a camera mounted on his helmet

The court heard the dead man had never been identified and no body had been found.

During his police interview, Marine A told detectives he fired a bullet into the insurgent through ‘stress and anger’ at seeing comrades killed on the battlefield. But he insisted the man was already dead.

Marine C wrote an account of the incident in his diary, the court heard. In it, he said he saw Marine A carrying out the killing. He wrote that his only regret was he felt ‘mugged off’ he had not been able to ‘pop off the Taliban s***bag’ himself’.

Confronted with the video in October 2012, the men changed their stories. Marine A admitted firing his pistol but said he ‘genuinely believed’ the man was dead. Marine B said he was giving the injured man first aid when Marine A shot him.

He said: ‘I was stunned and there was a long pause before I said anything. If I was saying “rog” or “roger” to Marine A after, I was just acknowledging I heard what he said – I was not agreeing with it.’

The case continues.
