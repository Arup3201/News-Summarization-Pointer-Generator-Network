Amanda Knox collapsed and had to be supported by her boyfriend yesterday when she was told she would face a retrial over the murder of Meredith Kercher.

The American was at home with her family in Seattle when she received a phone call at 2am telling her an Italian court had quashed her acquittal for the killing.

She was shattered by the news, and turned to her lover James Terrano in an attempt to 'keep positive' despite the new development.

Knox, 25, will not voluntarily return to Italy to stand trial, and is unlikely to be extradited by her native U.S. - she will therefore probably be tried in absentia.

Questions: Meredith Kercher's sister Stephanie Kercher, left, said at her family's home in Coulsdon, Surrey: 'There are a lot of unanswered questions still'. Right, her sister before her 2007 death

'The colour ran from her face as she heard the news,' a source told the Sun.

Her lawyer phoned her family home in 
the early hours of the morning after she had gathered relatives and 
friends together to wait for confirmation of the court's decision.

'She hugged James and then the rest of the family,' the source said. 'They are trying to keep positive but it is hard.'

Yesterday’s ruling by the supreme court in Rome means the case will be tried again next year.

Judges
accepted that there were ‘contradictions’ in the case, quashing the 
acquittal of Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 
29.

In a dramatic turnaround, the pair, 
who both spent four years behind bars before they were cleared, were 
told they must stand trial again for the murder of the 21-year-old 
British student.

Knox, who has rebuilt her life in her 
home town of Seattle, cannot be compelled by Italian law to 
appear at the retrial and might not face extradition for years, if at 
all.

Meredith's sister Stephanie and mother Arline welcomed the news about the retrial on Tuesday

Jailed: Knox, 25, and Sollecito, 29, spent four years in jail, but were freed on appeal in 2011 largely on the grounds DNA evidence was flawed

Her lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova said: 
‘Amanda does not intend to come back for the retrial. Her home is in 
Seattle and she doesn’t need to be here.’

He added that the decision to order a 
new trial was shocking. ‘She thought that the nightmare was over,’ he 
said on the steps of the courthouse. ‘But she’s ready to fight.’

Within minutes of the ruling, Knox 
issued a statement condemning it. The girl known worldwide by her 
self-awarded nickname 'Foxy Knoxy' said: ‘It was painful to receive the 
news that the Italian supreme court decided to send my case back for 
revision when the prosecution’s theory of my involvement in Meredith’s 
murder has been repeatedly revealed to be completely unfounded and 
unfair.

‘I believe that any questions as to my innocence must be examined by an objective investigation and a capable prosecution.

‘The prosecution responsible for the 
many discrepancies in their work must be made to answer for them, for 
Raffaele’s sake, my sake, and most especially for the sake of Meredith’s
family.’

Knox and Sollecito spoke on the phone 
soon after yesterday’s verdict. Sollecito’s current girlfriend Annie 
Achille said: ‘They will see what can be done.’ She added that her 
boyfriend, who turned 29 yesterday, is ‘destroyed’ and not talking to 
anyone.

Meredith Kercher, from Coulsdon, 
Surrey, was in Italy as an exchange student from Leeds University. She 
was found dead in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox in the 
picturesque hilltop town of Perugia.

Her throat had been slit and her 
semi-naked body had been covered with a duvet. After a lengthy trial in 
Perugia, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of the murder in December 
2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively,

But two years later the pair were 
freed after an appeal court found that the case had been botched and DNA
evidence contaminated.

A third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA
and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene, is serving a
16-year prison sentence, reduced from 30 years on appeal.

Meredith’s family welcomed yesterday’s
judgment. Her sister Stephanie said: ‘We are never going to be happy 
about any outcome because we have still lost Meredith but we obviously 
support the decision and hope to get answers from it. There are still so
many unanswered questions. All we have ever wanted to do is do what we 
can for Meredith and to find out the truth of what happened that night.’

Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were seen kissing in the wake of the murder

Knox had rejoiced after her conviction
was sensationally overturned in 2011. She fled Italy within hours, 
returning home to the US, where she quickly embraced life as a free 
woman. She now shares a flat with boyfriend James Terrano, a classical 
guitarist, and is studying at the University of Washington in Seattle, 
where she can be near her parents and three sisters.

The former student is preparing for 
the publication next month of  a memoir for which she has been paid a 
reported £2.5million.

Sollecito remained in Italy and is studying 
robotic surgery at the University of Verona. He has already released a 
book about his experience. In it he said that he and Knox were still in 
touch – he visited her earlier this year and they speak on Skype 
regularly.

The retrial will be held in Florence, with different judges, to avoid accusations of prejudice against the accused pair.

Rudy Guede was identified by police after his bloody fingerprint was found on a cushion at the scene of the crime.

The
21-year-old Ivory Coast national had given his fingerprints when he 
applied for an Italian identity card several years earlier.

He was known to police as a petty thief and small time drug dealer.

Guede
had arrived in Italy in 1992 as a five year-old child with his father 
Roger, who left his wife behind in west Africa to seek work in Italy.

But
when Guede was 15 Roger went back to Africa, leaving his son behind in 
the care of a multi-millionaire Paolo Caporali who had 
occasionally employed the boy in odd jobs.

In
the summer of 2007, Guede rented a flat in the centre of Perugia and 
became friendly with four male students who lived in the flat below Miss
Kercher and Knox.

In 
September and October Guede was linked to three break-ins - two in 
Perugia and one in Milan.

Following the murder he fled Perugia and went to Germany on a train. He was arrested there and extradited back to Italy.

In
October 2008 he was sentenced to 30 years in jail for the murder and 
sexual assault of Miss Kercher after opting for a fast-track trial.

The day before his arrest on suspicion of Meredith Kercher's murder, Patrick Lumumba had been handing out flyers publicising a candlelit vigil in her memory.

Mr Lumumba, a well-known and popular figure in Perugia for a decade, 
was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

He is believed to be 
related to murdered Congolese prime minister Patrice Lumumba.

He arrived
in Italy legally in 1988.

Married with a young child, he opened a
bar and restaurant called Le Chic on a narrow street in Perugia town 
centre in August 2007.

The same month that Miss Kercher arrived to begin a 
short Italian course.

He employed her housemate Amanda Knox to help him with promotional work, before firing her for flirting with customers.

He believes Knox took her revenge by framing him for Miss Kercher's murder.

Mr
Lumumba was arrested on suspicion of causing her death on November 6.

He spent two weeks in prison before being able to prove that he spent 
the night of the killing talking to a customer in his pub.

In 2009  he sued Knox for wrongly accusing him of the crime.
