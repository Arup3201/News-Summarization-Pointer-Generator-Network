There is some weight behind the notion that this has been Birmingham City’s best week for almost four years. If hitting Reading for six wasn’t encouraging enough, the resignation of the unpopular director Peter Pannu ought to have made it so. Not since the Carling Cup win at Wembley against Arsenal have such broad smiles been seen on the faces of Blues in the second city.

They have been a club whose recent history is entrenched in misery and financial ruin, brought about by Carson Yeung’s disastrous ownership from 2009, and Pannu has always been seen as the chairman’s sidekick. 

It was he who assumed the acting role when Yeung relinquished himself of duties at the club ahead of being sentenced to a six-year jail term for money laundering in March.

It is under the watch of this pair that the Blues have seen a trail of destruction follow them, with a transfer embargo issued in 2012 and accounts filed late. The club suffered, a shadow of the one to spend seasons in the Premier League and a ground, St Andrew’s, that home fans didn’t want to visit. Many simply didn’t bother. 

They have been under the control of Panos Pavlakis, who has operated as the club’s managing director, amid the upheaval in September when Pannu’s five-year contract was up.

Birmingham have been sleepwalking into the lower leagues after serial neglect, but there appears to be a chink of light.

Pannu’s departure - barely recognised by the club, who issued a statement made up of two paragraphs on Friday - comes in the aftermath of threatening comments he allegedly made to a fans’ website and author of a book about the club, also suggesting financial ruin wasn’t far away.

Supporters remain worried that he could come back with a vengeance.

Gary Rowett has instilled a brighter environment since taking over from the maligned Lee Clark 

Pannu is up for re-election of the club’s parent company, Birmingham International Holdings (BIH), on December 23 and, if successful, could still have a huge role to play when the club eventually changes hands.

The Blues Trust have set up a petition in a bid to voice concern to BIH shareholders, claiming: ‘From a lack of communication with supporters to the excessive remuneration package he received while acting chairman of the club, Pannu showed not only a lack of basic leadership, but also a lack of respect for the club’s true custodians – the fans.

Yeung - who bought the club in 2009 - was jailed for six years after being found guilty of money laundering

‘We believe that the re-election of Peter Pannu will see the return of these issues. Thus, as supporters, we must act to ensure that this does not happen – for the best interests of BCFC.’

And they’ve far more chance of uniting against the systematic decline of their club while results improve dramatically.

That boils down to one man: Gary Rowett. Appointed manager after Lee Clark left in October, the former full back has overseen four wins from his seven games in charge, losing just once.

That includes the drubbing dished out to hapless Reading at the weekend, thanks to a hat-trick from 18-year-old local boy Demarai Gray - only the second time they have scored more than four goals in a league fixture since January 2006.

For the record, Jiri Jarosik, Matthew Upson, Jermaine Pennant, David Dunn and Mikael Forssell all scored in a 5-0 win against Portsmouth that day. How times change.

But now Rowett, widely regarded as one of the brightest young prospects in management after impressing at Burton Albion, has Birmingham playing with panache again, and the enjoyment is back.

So too are the fans. St Andrew’s is a place people actually want to visit nowadays and the Blues have a boss who is passionate about his job; not embarrassingly storming down the touchline after escaping relegation to League One on the final day kind of passion, the sort which has people hanging on his every word.

That coupled with the potentially for fans to get their way and Pannu isn’t re-elected later this month, the situation really looks as if it is for turning.

Good week for... YEOVIL

The Glovers warmed up for their FA Cup replay against Accrington Stanley by thumping League One play-off chasers Oldham 4-0 at Boundary Park. It was a family affair as Yeovil boss Gary Johnson got the better of his son Lee's upwardly mobile side. The Glovers had only scored 14 goals in the entire season beforehand and are now a couple of points off safety.

Bad week for... LEYTON ORIENT

Another defeat, this time at the hands of Darren Ferguson’s Peterborough United at home, means Orient have lost seven of their last 10 in all competitions. New manager Fabio Liverani has quite the job on his hands, marooned in the bottom four.

Talent scout: JORDAN COOK (Walsall)

Two goals and an assist isn’t a bad return for the 24-year-old as Walsall beat Barnsley, but watch out for Cook’s first - the striker smashed home a half-volley direct from a corner on the edge of the box.
