More than 100,000 children aged between six and 11 have visited pro-anorexia websites that encourage people to compete against eachother in deadly starvation games, a study has found.

There are at least 500 of these 'gruesome' sites, which encourage vulnerable young women to barely eat and just drink coffee, smoke and take diet pills to look like a 'goddess'.

Using the phrase 'starving for perfection' they say users should eat no more than 500 calories a day - the recommended level is 2,000 for women and 2,500 for men.

Scandal: Hundreds of sites like this one exist - the post cannot be shown and is one of many showing how people can use techniques to become dangerously thin

Message: Negative imagery painted with words like these are looked at by 500,000 people per year, a study has found

They also include 'thinspiration' sections with images of super-slim women, including Fearne Cotton, Katy Holmes and Sarah Harding, and in the last year 500,000 girls have admitted visiting them, and one in five were aged between six and 11.

University Campus Suffolk in Ipswich has carried out research into the issue and found than many of these websites are set up by people with anorexia and other eating disorders.

'It starts with an individual who wants to share their experience and as they get a following they set themselves up as almost Goddess-like,' researcher Dr Emma Bond, senior lecturer in childhood and youth studies said.

'When I started this research last January I came across a website set up by a girl who was disgusted with herself because she had put on a few pounds at Christmas. She planned to fast for three days and regain control.

Pictures: Images like these (Fearne Cotton left and Sarah Harding's torso right) are used as 'thinspiration' for people using these pro-anorexic sites

'In under two hours, she had 36 followers saying things like "You’re wonderful, you’re an inspiration to me, I’m only fasting because of you".'

Some of the people are even posting pictures of themselves in very few clothes on thousands of blogs and on social media like Twitter.

Official figures show that one in 200 women and one in 2,000 men have anorexia – which means they starve themselves or exercise excessively to stay slim – although some experts believe the true number is much higher.

Around eight per cent of women and one per cent of men develop bulimia at some point. They binge on excessive amounts of food then make themselves sick or use laxatives to stop gaining weight.

Many sufferers of eating disorders hide their problem from family and friends by pretending they have already eaten to avoid meals and wearing baggy clothes to conceal their skeletal shape.

Doctors believe that anorexia or bulimia is more common in people who are perfectionists, tend to worry a lot or are often depressed.

Dangerous: The internet is awash with these very basic sites and they are designed to make people with eating disorders feel part of a group and compete against eachother

Although experts blame society’s ‘size zero’ obsession for the recent surge in cases, it can be triggered by stressful events such as a death in the family, bullying at school or parents getting divorced.

Dr Bond said: 'Girls are posting images of themselves and are then approached by people who want to sell them on porn sites because there is a market for "skinny porn".  But the girls are  unaware they are being looked at for sexual gratification.

'To a vulnerable teenager they appear lovely, pretty and attractive and give a sense of belonging. But they have a gruesome side too.'

Her study is called: 'Virtually Anorexic – Where’s the harm?' and was backed by the Nominet Trust and charity b-eat.
