When Cheryl Cole stepped into Japanese restaurant Zuma last night for Kimberley Walsh's birthday party last night wearing a skintight leather dress, it was a wonder one of the sushi chefs didn't chop off his finger in shock. 

The Girls Aloud singer and former X Factor star looked jaw-dropping in the stretch mustard number,  a £1,800 piece from Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's luxury label The Row.

But for those of us without an A-list bank account, is it possible to get a flash of that Cole magic in our wardrobes?

Getting leathered! Cheryl Cole looked stunning last night in a light tan leather dress for bandmate Kimberley Walsh's birthday party at Knightsbridge restaurant Zuma

The short answer is yes. Leather brand Kaliko have a lookalike tan leather dress, which is available at House of Fraser for £150, and currently discounted at £115 at Debenhams.

Of course, the High Street version is less likely to cling in all the right places in the way that Cheryl's does.

Leaving aside for a moment the fact that most of us could only dream of having the body of the petite yet curvy star, the leather on the designer version is stretchy and buttersoft - making it comfortable and flattering to wear.

The High Street version likely does not have the same element of stretch (it is very costly to create buttersoft leather with decent stretch, hence why J Brand's leather jeans sell for upwards of £800 and Sandro's stretch leather leggings are a credit card-scorching £645.).

But for the price and the overall appeal of the look, the bargainista's leather dress can't be beaten. Surprisingly enough, a leather dress is a more versatile garment than you'd think too.

Glam up with glossy hair, a slash of red lipstick and bare legs for a high maintenance look, or dress down with tights, boots and a chunky cardigan for weekend wear.
