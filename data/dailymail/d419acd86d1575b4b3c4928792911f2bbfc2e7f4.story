If you've ever spotted your waiter making odd gestures with their hands, they could be telling colleagues you're a VIP, a messy eater or be banning you from ever eating at the restaurant again.

Top restaurants are now teaching their staff to use a secret hand code to talk about their customers without them knowing.

The Washington Post noticed the phenomenon and spoke to Adam Sanders, manager of BLT Steak in Washington, who revealed his restaurant is often full of high-profile guests so staff make a sideways peace sign if a VIP comes in that needs special attention.

If a waiter makes this signal, they are telling other staff a VIP has arrived and will need special attention

But they also have a series of 
signals just for ordering drinks - a flat hand swipe for still water or 
wiggling fingers like a 'jellyfish' for sparkling water - as well as 
requesting the wine list or that a table be cleared.

Mr
 Sanders says this shaves seconds, or sometimes even minutes off the 
time it takes to serve people, making the dining experience more 
pleasurable.

The most important aspect is still that the customer remains unaware of the gestures so it appears good service is effortless.

In
the interview with the Washington Post, he said: 'Computers can only do 
so much as they're stationary, service is happening at the table.

Help: But if a waiter makes a signal as though they are about to take an oath, they need assistance from other staff members

A hand gesture to look like the letter 'C' means the chef needs to be asked a question from a customer

'Shaving off seconds and minutes you can communicate better with the guests. It enhances the experience and that's what we're here for.'

But guests enjoying cocktails in the dining room at CityZen in the Mandarin Oriental hotel won't be asked if they want another round if restaurant director Michael Chesser touches the side of the gas candle on their table. 

And if a waiter at Eleven Madison Park in Manhattan starts brushing his shoulder as a guest leaves, that signals they were a messy eater and the table needs to be cleared quickly.

Alex Susskind, an associate professor of food and beverage at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., tells his students the value of staff using signals to improve a customer's dining experience.

He said: 'You canâ€™t yell across the dining room, "Hey, I need help delivering food!"

'The service experience is perishable. It begins and ends quickly. What happens at the table can make or break it.'

Hand codes in the restaurant trade have been around for some time.

Back in the 1940s, the owner of New York's legendary Stork Club, Sherman Billingsley, would clasp his hands together and put one thumb up if a customer needed to be removed and banned for life.

Many restaurants use signals for a lot of their service - even to order drinks from the bar
