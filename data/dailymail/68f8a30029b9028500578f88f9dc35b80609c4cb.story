Red-faced workers watched in horror today as a lorry carrying tonnes of scaffolding fell off the side of a marina - and landed on top of a boat.

Staff at the scene blamed a ‘mechanical failure’ for the mishap, which saw the lorry roll backwards over the edge of the marina.

Luckily, it was saved from plunging into the water by a small tug boat a few feet below.

The lorry tonight remained hanging over the edge of Bourne End Marina, on the River Thames, in Slough, Buckinghamshire, until a crane could recover it.

A marina spokesman said he called out when he saw the vehicle start to roll at around 3pm, but it was too late.

He said: 'I have never seen anything like this in my whole time here.

'Someone could have been in the boat,' a spokesman said. The boat is pictured here crunched and partly submerged with the lorry resting on top

'Someone could have been in the boat or someone could have been stood there not taking notice.'

He added that the tug, which was owned by the marina, was ‘probably a write off’.

The scaffolding lorry was being used for work on a railway bridge.
