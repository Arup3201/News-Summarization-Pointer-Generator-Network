Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson 'set up the payments to facilitate' phone hacking, it was claimed in court today.

The paper's former royal editor Clive Goodman made the accusation against his old boss on the fourth day of his evidence at the hacking trial.

He also claimed Coulson told him he could keep his job if he told police he acted alone after his arrest in 2006.

The Old Bailey heard claims today that ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson knew about phone hacking during his time at the paper

Goodman, 56, was jailed along with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire in 2007 for hacking the phones of aides to Princes William and Harry.

Goodman told the Old Bailey jury yesterday that he felt he was 'being hung out to dry' after his arrest.

Describing his feelings after he was taken into custody, he said: 'I thought...lots of other people at the NotW were doing this and I was the one that got caught.

'Andy Coulson actually set up the payments to facilitate all this'.

After Goodman was charged, Coulson 
rang him and tried to persuade him to plead guilty as soon as possible 
and 'make a clean breast of it', he said.

'He wanted to know the depth of the police investigation and other names involved from the NotW,; he added.

Goodman later described another meeting with Coulson at a cafe in Wimbledon, south west London, when his then-boss allegedly tried again to convince him to admit he was a 'lone wolf' and had 'gone off the reservation'.

Goodman said Coulson promised him that if he pleaded guilty he could come back to a job at the NotW.

He claimed Coulson told him: 'You could be one of those people who come back - it’s up to you.'

Goodman said he was concerned about the dialogue between his lawyer and News International (NI) and claimed he was getting views of the company as well as the solicitor.

On a suggestion by his lawyer to give papers on the case to the NotW, he said: 'I absolutely did not want a set of prosecution documents going to the NotW because I did not trust them - and newspapers are leaky places.'

The court heard that during a meeting about the upcoming case, a company lawyer told him he would not be dismissed as long as he did not implicate anyone else.

If he named others, Goodman said he was told: 'You cannot expect Andy to take you back after that.'

At a subsequent meeting about the case, Goodman was advised by another lawyer, paid for by NI, not to implicate others in a five-page mitigation document, he said.

Goodman said that was despite the names of three more NotW staff appearing in prosecution papers as having contact with Mulcaire.

He told the court that since none of them had been arrested, police must have taken the decision to 'stop at me'.

He added: 'Despite this evidence, nobody was doing anything so I did not seem to have any choice.'

Coulson, 46, of Charing, Kent, denies conspiring to hack phones and commit misconduct in a public office.

Goodman, of Addlestone, Surrey, admitted hacking with Mulcaire in 2006. However, he denies conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office in the current trial.

Former Sun and News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks, 45 – whose two weeks of testimony ended last week – also denies conspiring to hack phones, misconduct and perverting the course of justice.

Her racehorse trainer husband Charlie Brooks, 51, denies conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over allegations evidence was hidden from the police.
