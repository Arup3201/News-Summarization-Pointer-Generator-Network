High Street stores have been caught up in an investigation into claims immigrants were used as slave labour and forced to work 80 hours a week for ‘pennies’.

The discovery was made when police raided a factory in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and found 20 eastern European ‘slaves’ making picture frames and other items.

Today it has emerged that B&M Bargains, which is run by former Tesco chief Sir Terry Leahy, and Floors2Go are among major retailers caught up in the inquiry.

A spokesman for B&M Retail – which owns B&M Bargains - said the company was 'shocked to learn of these recent allegations'

The immigrants were allegedly beaten, verbally abused and forced to work 12 hour days by ‘slave-masters’ for just a fraction of the minimum wage.

They were forced to live in a squalid house in Rochdale with the workers sleeping three or four to a room and sharing all facilities.

The men and women were being bussed to work in the industrial unit each morning, where they were paid around £1.50 an hour.

At the end of the week their £125 wage was docked £100 for rent and living expenses and they were handed just £25 to spend on themselves – equivalent to being paid 31p an hour. 

Detective Inspector James Faulkner of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said: ‘This is another excellent result from a joint operation which has strived to uncover and protect vulnerable victims from the men and women hoping to exploit them for their own financial gain.

‘The men and women working in the factory have told us that they were subjected to physical and verbal assaults at the hands of their employers and forced to work more than 80 hours before ending up with around £25 for their week’s work.’

He said: ‘This is a typical example of how modern slavery can work in the UK. The men and women are promised accommodation and jobs, but are forced to live in cramped, terrible conditions before being taken to work in a factory for more than 12 hours each day.

‘At the end of the week, the factory owners pay them around £125 for their 80 hours, but then take up to £100 away immediately for rent, travel and other expenses.

‘This leaves the men and women effectively working for pennies, while simultaneously ensuring they remain reliant on the people enslaving them.

‘When you consider that this factory was producing frames and pictures for major high street companies, with contracts running into the millions of pounds, it proves just how much money these men stood to make from this exploitation.’

The force has launched Operation Retriever in a bid to tackle human trafficking in Rochdale and has already smashed one gang of alleged slavers.

A police source said: ‘The conditions these people are kept in is absolutely shocking in modern-day Britain. Unfortunately these people are so desperate and reliant on these unscrupulous slave-masters that they are unable to report the matter because they know they would be deported.’

The ‘slaves’, all adults, were found during a police raid working in a unit at the Caldershaw Centre in Rochdale and had been subject to ‘physical and verbal abuse’, say police.

Mr Faulkner said: ‘Now GMP and our partners in Rochdale council will be striving to safeguard these victims from further exploitation, and we will do our utmost to ensure that the people responsible for this injustice are punished to the full extent of the law.’

B&M Bargains took over many of the defunct Woolworth’s stores when it went to the wall in 2009 and the chairman is Sir Terry Leahy.

A spokesman for B&M Retail – which owns B&M Bargains - said: ‘We were shocked to learn of these recent allegations. As soon as being made aware, we terminated trading with the company and cancelled all orders with immediate effect.’

A spokesman for Floors2Go said: ‘Floors2Go is a responsible company and is currently checking to see whether any of its stock originated from the manufacturer which is the subject of this enquiry.

‘We do inspect factories of overseas suppliers but in respect of UK suppliers we rely upon the expectation that they comply with UK laws in relation to health and safety and similar regulations which are enforced by local authorities.

‘The majority of our UK manufactured products are sourced from UK distributors who we expect in turn are responsible companies with lawful employment practices.’

Two men from Rochdale have been charged with slavery-related offences. 

Mohamad Iqbal, 51, of Belmont Way and Najum Mohammed Iqbal, 40, of Harrison Close are both charged with knowingly requiring another person to perform forced or compulsory labour.

Both have been remanded in custody.

The pair were due to appear at Bury and Rochdale Magistrates' Court today.

Three other men arrested as part of the police operation have been released on bail pending further inquiries.
