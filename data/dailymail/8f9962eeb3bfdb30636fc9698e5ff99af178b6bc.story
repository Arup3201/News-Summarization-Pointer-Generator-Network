Take a good long look at Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad in action for England and enjoy them while you can. For it will be a miracle if they are still standing, let alone still playing in 18 months time, without some serious rest periods.

A look at England’s schedule in that time, particularly the nine-month period from the middle of April next year to the middle of the following January, is confirmation that the cricketing world has gone well and truly mad.

There is so much international cricket, including an extraordinary 17 Tests in that nine-month spell, that it will surely finish off England’s big two fast bowlers and seriously shorten the careers of many an elite player to come.

Burn out: Stuart Broad has been struggling with a knee injury during the Test series against India

‘Greed is good, greed works’, says the Michael Douglas character Gordon Gekko in the 1987 film Wall Street, but he could easily have been talking about the England cricket team nearly 30 years later. This is all about money.

I have long believed that there is far too much international cricket, that the bottom line is pursued at the expense of the quality of the product. The concept of less is more, that every international match should mean something, is evidently lost on administrators obsessed with short-termism.

Now comes the tipping point. Now comes a year, once the relatively low-key build-up to Christmas is complete, which will jeopardise the longevity of players careers and undermine the quality and intensity of almost every England match.

In January England undertake a triangular one-day series in Australia, also featuring India, before they begin the elongated World Cup in February.

As soon as that is over, at the end of March, England will be off to the Caribbean for a three Test series before returning, via a one-day international in Ireland, for an Ashes summer which also features a Test and one-day series against New Zealand. Had enough yet? There’s more, much more.

As soon as the Ashes, surely the priority of the whole lot, are contested and another one-day and Twenty20 series against Australia is complete England will be off to the United Arab Emirates to face Pakistan in a three-Test series, plus the usual 50-over and Twenty20 matches, before a full tour of South Africa.

And on it goes into early 2016 when there is a World Twenty20 tournament in India and beyond.

Who will be left standing? England have been asked to play 17 Test matches over the next nine months

No rest for the cricket! England's calender

Now you might point out that players are well paid these days and an inevitable consequence of the wages they demand is that there has to be a full itinerary to pay the bills. But a Test every fortnight for nine months? England playing virtually on every third day throughout the whole of 2015? Crazy.

It’s impossible to know how much the demands of a life lived constantly out of a suitcase, with each pressurised match rapidly following another contributed to Jonathan Trott’s illness which forced him home from Australia.

But there is no doubt that the ECB are playing a dangerous game with the physical and mental well-being of their top players who, like Anderson  and Broad, simply will not be able to continue playing both Test and one-day cricket.

Then there are spectators who pay big money to watch England and are entitled to expect to see the best players performing to the maximum of their ability. How often is that going to happen?

There are many reasons why there have been more empty seats at England matches this summer than usual but the sheer volume of expensive cricket has to be at the forefront of them.

And, what’s more, the power grab of the International Cricket Council by India, England and Australia will inevitably mean that those English spectators who pay top dollar will watch more and more matches against the old enemy Australia and India.

Exhausted! Fans could miss the chance of seeing England stars like James Anderson if they are rested

Too much of a good thing? The Ashes will be contested for the third time in just over two years in 2015

Familiarity will not only breed contempt, as we are seeing between England and India, but also indifference. The Ashes are special because, like football World Cups and rugby’s Lions tours, they should not come around too often.

Yet next year will be the third Ashes series in little more than two years. When will the magic disappear? Some time soon, surely.

But don’t worry because even when England are not playing Australia and India they will be playing someone else. Too much of a good thing? Unquestionably. And hugely worrying for both players and supporters alike.
