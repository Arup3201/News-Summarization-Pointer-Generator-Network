An elderly couple suffering from ill health embarked on a joint suicide pact after telling relatives they 'could not live without each other', a coroner heard today.

Retired nurse Olive Climpson, 82, wrote a note to daughter Nicola stating the couple's intention to take their own lives at their home in Earley, Berkshire on September 28 last year.

Mrs Climpson and her husband James, 82, had both been suffering from deteriorating health and were found dead at their home by their daughter and a friend.

Mr and Mrs Climpson both suffered from poor health and told relatives they 'couldn’t live without each other.'

Ms Climpson had visited her parents the previous day and although Mr Climpson seemed his normal self, her mother was 'more touchy feely' and thanking her 'for all the help and support.'

The inquest heard how the couple had been devastated by the recent death of their other daughter, Mandy, which Mr Climpson, a retired accountant, described as 'the biggest disaster he had known.'

They were both also suffering from deteriorating health, with Mrs Climpson, a type-two diabetic, having recently spent 11 days in hospital with high blood pressure.

During this time Mr Climpson had struggled to cope without his wife and had not been able to have a bath or shower while she was away.

Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford was told that on September 28 last year, Ms Climpson tried to call her parents but got no answer and eventually went around to the house with her friend, Lynden Lee.

She found her mother wrapped in a blanket on the sofa, bent forward, with the TV turned on.

'It just looked as though she had been watching TV,' said Mr Bedford.

'On touching her she was cold and you feared the worst.'

Ms Climpson then went into the bedroom and found her father lying dead on the bed.

An ambulance was called but the couple were declared dead at the scene.

The inquest heard that since Mandy died, the couple had talked a lot about death and said they would not want to be kept alive.

Describing the moment she found her parents dead, Ms Climpson said: 'I wasn’t as shocked as I thought I would be.'

'The fact that they went together, that’s what they would have wanted. As far as I’m concerned they both took their own lives.'

'I think they were just very concerned that they couldn’t look after each other. They were miserable.'

'I think my mum knew she would cope without my dad but she knew my dad wouldn’t cope without her.'

Mr Bedford said: 'Both Mr Climpson and his wife had expressed a wish in life not to live without each other.'

Addressing the couple’s daughter, the coroner added: 'You have no doubt what happened here. Between them they’ve said ‘is this worth continuing?'

Mrs Climpson had recently asked the local council about care that could be provided for them, but the coroner said nothing could have been done to prevent their deaths.

Mr Bedford recorded a narrative verdict on the deaths.
