This snappy shark was clearly not in the mood for a close-up, snatching one petrified photographer's camera straight out of his arms before swimming off into the distance with it.

After posing for several pictures during a diving expedition in the Bahamas, the toothy tyrant obviously decided enough was enough.

Swimming up to the horrified photographer, the Tiger shark grabbed the expensive camera in his ferocious jaws.

Thief: As the other sharks move away, one stays close to the diver and eyes up the camera

It then calmly swam off with the £11,000 piece of kit.

Thankfully, the photographer and guide managed to get the camera back - as the disinterested shark dropped it only 100 metres away.

Fellow photographer, Miguel Lasa, watched the sly shark pinch the camera and managed to capture the commotion on camera.

The 49-year-old, who works as a GP in the north east of England, said: 'The shark literally took the camera straight from the hands of our guide photographer.

What's that you got there? The creature looks straight down the camera at the photographer, perhaps trying to decipher what he is holding

What are you looking at? The deadly animal gets up close and personal to the divers showing off his daunting set of teeth

'The equipment has arms and strobes attached so it immediately attracted the attention of the shark, it's very bulky so it was easy for the shark to grab hold of.

'They are very powerful and can swim long distances very fast.

'Luckily though the shark decided to drop the camera onto the sea bed about 100 metres away.

'The guide was actually very lucky to get the camera back.

'It cost around £11,000 with the housing and it would have only taken him a few minutes to swim miles away.

'Miraculously
 it was in perfect condition without so much as a scratch. It's amazing 
really considering the slightest crack would allow the salt water in and
 destroy it in seconds.

'It's crazy how sharks can have such sharp teeth and such a gentle bite.'

It's mine now! The Tiger shark makes off with the £11,000 piece of kit held tightly in his grasp

Expensive steal: The divers said the equipment, which has arms and strobes attached, was quite easy for the shark to pick-up in his jaws

Miguel said although it was a once in a lifetime experience he was petrified of what might happen next.

He said: 'At the time I was diving without a cage, it was a great experience but I wouldn't do it again as it was too dangerous.

'When I saw the shark take the camera from the photographer I rushed to try and get a shot of the extraordinary event.

'Fortunately I managed to get it.

'I was scared though. You never know when a shark is getting too close.

'They have powerful bites and could take your arm or leg off in a split second.

Not bothered: The culprit thankfully dropped the equipment, in good condition, 100 metres away

'I wasn't worried about my camera but I was worried for my personal safety.

'I've never seen anything like this before. It was an amazing event.'

Tiger sharks are considered
 to be one of the most dangerous shark species in the world.

They are 
responsible for many recorded attacks on humans, second only to the 
great white shark.

However, its usual prey is varied and can include anything from crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles, and sea snakes, to dolphins and even other smaller sharks.

The tiger shark is considered a near threatened species due to fishing by humans.
