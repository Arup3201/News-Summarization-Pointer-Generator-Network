A Spanish family who lost a memory card while on holiday in Scotland have been reunited with over 500 pictures of their holiday of a lifetime - all thanks to a Facebook campaign by a Scottish student.

Barry Carruthers, 22, a drama student, said that the memory card had still worked and was filled with pictures of a family taken at Scotland's most iconic sights.

In an ingenious move, he selected several and posted them on Facebook, illustrating the family's trips to iconic locations across Scotland, in hopes that someone online would recognise them.

From there, the message went global.

Social media from Shetland to Hong Kong joined in the hunt for the family, even going so far as to contact American talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres on Twitter, in hopes that she'd spread the world. 

He said: 'This family had been everywhere, and done it all.

'They went to the Military Tattoo at Edinburgh Castle, the Fringe, the Royal Mile, Knockhill Circuit, Ayr - you name it.

Student, Barry Carruthers, found the memory card and posted photos online in an attempt to find the family

The social media campaign went viral and even Ellen DeGeneres was contacted via Twitter to help. Pictured: Eilean Donan Castle in the Western highlands

'I've lived in Scotland all my life, and there were a few places I couldn't even identify.'

After looking through the family-of-four's all-encompassing epic Scottish trip, Carruthers said he felt compelled to reunite the tourists with their photos.

The pictures seem to feature a family of four, specifically two parents and their son and daughter, reportedly from Barcelona.

The Spanish media have now confirmed that the family had gotten in touch with the student to claim back the pictures.

Eventually, the manager of the Ibis hotel where the family had stayed in Edinburgh contacted Barry

The son then reached out and contacted Carruthers and arranged for delivery of the memory card

Local newspaper La Vanguardia said the family had been identified as Spanish because of the fact that one of the photographs shows the family pointing a red star in reference to the Catalan beer brand and there was another picture of the family next to the car driven by the Barcelona pilot Pepe massot.

That allowed the manager of the Ibis hotel where the family stayed while on their trip to Edinburgh to identify them and contact Barry.

Carruthers said: 'I have only spoken to the son of the family, but they are from the Catalonia area and the son studies in Barcelona. He is completely shocked.

'The guy from the hotel, Jamie got in touch with the mum after seeing the photos on Facebook and she's delighted.'

The family had apparently lost their camera, and whoever found it must have dumped the memory card where it was then found by the student i front of a multi storey car park in Glasgow.
