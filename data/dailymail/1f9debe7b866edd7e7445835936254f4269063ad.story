Newcastle head coach John Carver has demanded action against the Crystal Palace fan who threw a coin that hit Fabricio Coloccini in the face at Selhurst Park.

The incident occurred as the Newcastle players celebrated Papiss Cisse's opener in the 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace on Wednesday evening.

A furious Carver insisted that Coloccini was lucky not to be blinded by the coin.

Newcastle head coach John Carver was left fuming after his captain was struck by a coin at Selhurst Park

Fortunately for the Argentine the coin did not hit him in the eye and he played the full 90 minutes

'That can't happen, can it?' said Carver. 'It's disappointing from Palace's point of view as they have an unbelievable atmosphere, and one idiot has thrown a coin.

'It missed Coloccini's eye by one inch - it could have blinded him.

'You can't have that in this game. I hope the authorities deal with it, and I'm sure they will because it will be on TV every other minute and rightly so. Let's find out who it was and sort it out.'

The coin was handed to referee Andre Marriner after the match and the Football Association will investigate the incident after reading the official's report.
