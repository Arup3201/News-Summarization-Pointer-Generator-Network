Playboy reportedly offered $31,250 in an attempt to 'buy its peace' while the Privilege agency allegedly offered the same amount.

In a lawsuit filed in L.A. County Superior Court, Mendes had claimed she was on the dancefloor when the burly rapper, whose real name is Giwar Hajabi, approached her.

She said she asked him to leave her alone but he responded by stepping on her foot, pulling her hair and punched her in the nose.'

She also suggested that Xatar who is 6'0"
and 235 lbs, should not have been allowed in the mansion in the first 
place as he was known for drunken , unruly and combative and violent 
behavior,

Mendes said that despite the fact she was bleeding profusely, she was not offered any medical attention and was just put aboard a shuttle bus and taken to her car.

Later that year Xatar, whose stage name means 'Danger' in his native Kurdish language, was allegedly involved in a $2.5million robbery on a security van carrying a gold.

Two of the alleged criminals were arrested in February 2010, while Xatar and three other fugitives were later arrested in Iraq.
