Northumbria chief constable Sue Sim, pictured, is being investigated about the way she treats senior officers under her command

The top police officer in the hunt for cop-killer Raoul Moat is being investigated for bullying male officers who are allegedly terrified of receiving her Alex Ferguson-style hair dryer treatment.

Northumbria's Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird is currently looking into claims that chief constable Sue Sim has left her senior officers demoralised over the candid manner she delivers critical assessments.

Less than one in four chief constables in England and Wales are women. 

Northumbria Police told Mail Online that they were unwilling to discuss the situation. 

One source told The Times: 'One woman has all these grown men walking on eggshells because they're terrified of her. She's a heart on her sleeve person but the knives seem to be out for her.' 

Her style has been compared to her predecessor Sir John Stevens who delivered what have been described as legendary 'b**********' to the officers under his command.

Chief Constable Sim came to public prominence during the hunt for crazed killer Raoul Moat in 2010 when she held her position in a temporary capacity. 

Speaking in September 2011, the six-foot tall police chief revealed she had received sexist criticism during the manhunt and was the subject of cruel jokes. 

Addressing a North East women's business conference, Chief Constable Sim said: 'It was quite hurtful to read what the media said about my hair and make-up, and them making comparisons with Margaret Beckett.

'I can't imagine that they would have done the same if I was a short fat man. 

'I work in a male dominated environment, so there have been obstacles simply because I'm a woman, but it also helps that I'm a six foot woman, so that makes it easier to stand my ground.

'But I had an important job to and I had to get on with it.'

PCC Baird confirmed the chief constable is under investigation. 

She said: 'Over the past few days, I have sought clarification about the issues raised by some officers. I am no clear that they wish to make complaints against the chief constable of Northumbria Police which merit investigation. 

'The first step in the statutory process in such a situation is for me to assess the severity of any such complaint and I have done so. 

'I have told the chief constable that there is a prima facie case to be investigated as to whether she is guilty of misconduct. 

'The nature of the complaint to be investigated is that the chief constable may have fallen short of her tudy as a police officer to treat her colleagues with respect and courtesy.'

PCC Baird confirmed that chief constable Sim has not been suspended and the probe does not involve gross misconduct. 

Chief constable Sim confirmed she will assist the investigation into her conduct but was unable to comment further.
