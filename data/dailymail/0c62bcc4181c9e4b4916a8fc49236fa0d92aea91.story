A schoolboy has revealed how a playground fight that left him unconscious, helped to unearth a life-threatening heart condition.

Callum Massey, 13, stopped breathing when he was punched by a fellow pupil and paramedics rushed to his rescue.

Unable to revive him fully for two days, doctors discovered he had an irregular heartbeat and he was fitted with a pacemaker-style device.

After a three month recovery Callum is now well enough to return to lessons although his illness has yet to be diagnosed.

His school has been given a mobile 
defibrillator by the British Heart Foundation, which can be used to give the heart an electric shock in during cardiac arrest.

His mother Lynne, 35, from Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, said: 'The playground fight was what helped us find out that Callum had this condition in a strange kind of way.

'It was a nightmare when it happened. It shows how fragile life can be.

'I had a phone call saying there had been an accident. When we got to the school gates it was so terrifying.'

After the incident Callum was rushed to King’s Mill 
Hospital, and then transferred to Glenfield Hospital, in Leicester, 
where he spent more than three weeks being treated.

During that time doctors found Asperger’s Syndrome sufferer Callum had a potentially fatal 
heart condition which had previously been undetected.

He was fitted with an internal defibrillator to shock his heart if anything should happen again and prescribed with a daily dose of beta-blocker drugs, which are used to treat irregular heart conditions.

Hospital check-ups are also required every three months and his family have been warned it is a life-long condition.

Mother-of-three Mrs Massey, said she and her husband, Andrew, 35,
were thankful for the actions of school staff.

The school’s caretaker and teaching assistant were among those who came to Callum’s aid.

Both were given Good Samaritan Awards by East Midlands Ambulance Service last week for their life-saving efforts.

Headmaster Dr John Edwards added: 'I feel really proud of our staff - they worked as a team and were very calm. Their intervention was perfect really and saved Callum’s life.'

Nottinghamsire Police revealed earlier this month that the schoolboy who assaulted Callum, because of his age, would not be charged with a criminal offence.

Instead he will be put through a restorative justice course aimed at making him realise the 
consequences of his actions.

Mrs Massey said the family had 
received a letter of apology from the boy, and that they had also shown 
him a photo diary of the time Callum spent in hospital.
