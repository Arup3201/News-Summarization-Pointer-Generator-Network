In southwest China, at least 207 families are grieving for loved ones killed by a powerful earthquake which struck shortly after 8am on Saturday.

The region has been rocked by some 1,300 aftershocks since the 6.6 magnitude quake hit, and state media say 11,500 are injured, 960 of them seriously.

The situation remains desperate, as rescuers battle to reach remote villages razed by the earthquake.

Amid the horror, though, two tiny miracles have come to light, standing as symbols of hope amid the destruction.

This picture shows a three-month-old baby who was pulled alive from the rubble after the quake hit the steep hills of Sichuan Province.

Though her mother was killed in the devastation, the tiny girl survived the quake and is now in the care of medics.

Meanwhile, new mother Zhou Chunzhi delivered her newborn baby just two hours after the disaster, in a makeshift operating room set up in Ya'an People's Hospital.

According to the People's Daily Online, she has been named 'Zhensheng,' which means 'born on the day of the quake'.

The baby girl and her family have been flooded with goodwill messages as the public took to Chinese microblogging service Weibo to send their love and support.

One commenter using the screen name 'yinqingyouxin' wrote: 'I will pray for the baby, and I wish her all the best. Five years ago, my baby was born on the night of the Wenchuan earthquake. I know how the mother is feeling.'

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang arrived in Ya'an by helicopter on Saturday afternoon to direct rescue efforts.

'The current priority is to save lives,' Li said, after visiting hospitals and tents, and climbing onto a pile of rubble to view the devastation.

As the quake struck just after 8am, many people were at home, sleeping or having breakfast.

Tens of thousands of people moved into tents or cars, unable to return home or too afraid to go back as aftershocks continued to jolt the region.

In Ya'an, residents sat in groups outside convenience stores watching the news on television sets.

The government has mobilised thousands of soldiers and others, sending excavators and other heavy machinery as well as tents, blankets and other emergency supplies.

The Chinese Red Cross said it had deployed relief teams with supplies of food, water, medicine and rescue equipment to the disaster areas.

Lushan, where the quake struck, lies where the fertile Sichuan plain meets foothills that eventually rise to the Tibetan plateau and sits on the Longmenshan fault.

It was along the same fault line that a devastating magnitude 7.9 quake struck on May 12, 2008, leaving more than 90,000 people dead or missing and presumed dead in one of the worst natural disasters to strike China in recent decades.

'It was just like May 12,' Liu Xi, a writer in Ya'an city, said via a private message on his account on the Twitter-like Weibo service. 'All the home decorations fell at once, and the old house cracked.'

The official Xinhua News Agency said the well-known Bifengxia panda preserve, which is near Lushan, was not affected by the quake.

Dozens of pandas were moved to Bifengxia from another preserve, Wolong, after its habitat was wrecked by the 2008 quake.
