The family of a woman murdered on Valentine’s Day by her boyfriend say they have been caused additional pain and suffering after being told that the SpongeBob SquarePants headstones that they paid $26,000 to have built are ‘inappropriate’ for the Cincinnati cemetery where their daughter is buried.

Sgt. Kimberly Walker, 28, was found dead in a Colorado Springs, Colo., hotel room on Valentine’s Day and her boyfriend, also a soldier, has been charged with first-degree murder.

To stand as a tribute to their lost loved one, the Walker family decided it would be fitting to erect two 7,000-pound SpongeBob SquarePants monuments at Walker’s graveside in the historic Spring Grove Cemetery.

According to Deborah Walker, Kimberly’s mother, her daughter loved everything to do with the cartoon character and had countless SpongeBob-branded items including shower curtains.

‘SpongeBob went in her casket before we laid her in the ground,’ she told WLWT.com.

After receiving approval from a cemetery employee in March, the family decided on the design for the SpongeBob monuments and paid 10 percent of the price for the two $13,000 each statues upfront.

The Walkers also purchased six plots together at the cemetery to provide the required space to erect them.

Mom Deborah Walker has said that the family want to honor their dead daughter with the SpongeBob statues, while Kimberly's twin sister Kara has described them as 'the greatest thing in the cemetery'

The SpongeBob monuments were erected on Oct 10, but the next day  bosses contacted the family to say that their design was 'inappropriate' for such a historic cemetery

‘They stand 6 feet tall and he’s 4 feet wide and he’s on a platform of eight inches, so it makes him 6 feet 8 inches tall,’ said Ms Walker.

Each SpongeBob wears a military uniform, one in an Army uniform for Kimberly and the other in a Navy uniform for twin sister Kara, who is an IT Specialist in the U.S. Navy.

The monuments also have an American flag on one sleeve and the No. 24 for Kimberly’s favorite Nascar driver Jeff Gordon on the other.

‘I thought it was the greatest thing in the cemetery. I even told the people there that I think this is the best monument I’ve ever seen. It’s the best headstone in the cemetery and they all agreed. It came out really nice,’ said sister Kara.

The monuments were finally installed at the cemetery on October 10, but the next day cemetery officials informed the Walker family that the twin SpongeBobs were inappropriate and had to be removed.

Spring Grove has apologized for the misunderstanding and has offered to pay for something more in keeping with the surroundings, but the family wants to keep SpongeBob

Spring Grove has accepted responsibility for the misunderstanding and promised to work with the family to design at alternative which they hope will be more in keeping with the historic cemetery.

‘Spring Grove is deeply sorry for the issues involving the monument the Walker family recently purchased. Although the family chose a design with the guidance of a Spring Grove employee, unfortunately the monument did not fit within Spring Grove Cemetery guidelines,’ President and CEO Gary Freytag told WLWT in a written statement.

‘As an historic cemetery, we must constantly balance the needs of families who have just suffered a loss with the thousands of families who have entrusted us in the past.

'We are working with the Walker family and are committed to design a solution, at our expense, that will properly memorialize Kimberly, within the context of Spring Grove’s historic landscape and guidelines.’

Cemetery officials and the Walkers are scheduled to meet later this week to reach a resolution, but the family are upset that Spring Grove is going back on the agreement made in March to honor their daughter with twin SpongeBob monuments.

‘I feel like, and we all feel like, SpongeBob should stay there. We bought the plots, all six of them. We put the monuments there, we did what we had to do and they said they could provide that service to us,’ said Ms Walker.

Following Walker’s murder in February, her boyfriend Sgt. Montrell Mayo was charged with first-degree murder.

The
 arrest affidavit states that Mayo, a Fort Carson soldier, admitted to 
his supervisor in a phone call ‘I think I killed my girlfriend’ after 
the two had an altercation at a hotel in Colorado Springs

The 
affidavit states that Mayo told his supervisor that Walker threatened 
his career, then he hit her with a glass and doesn’t remember anything 
after that

Police who responded to the scene found Walker’s body and blood on the bed sheets, clothing and sink. An autopsy report states that Walker was strangled.
