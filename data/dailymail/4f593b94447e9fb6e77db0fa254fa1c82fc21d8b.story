A New York-based real estate agent has denied he is a Rod Stewart impersonator who has been roaming the city in recent months pretending to be the rock star to get free drinks and meals from his fans.

Paul Anton, 62, who lives in Midtown West, admits that he does look like the Maggie May singer, but does not use the resemblance to con unwitting fans.

He was photographed on the Subway recently looking a little the worse for wear, and internet users speculated as to whether he was the doppelganger who has been scamming fans in the city.

The sneaky lookalike - who was a British accent - has attended soccer World Cup parties over the summer pretending to be the veteran singer, and has been dubbed 'Rockaway Rod' for his random New York City cameos

But Mr Anton insisted he had never used his likeness to Stewart to get free drinks. 

He told the Page6.com: 'I have never pretended to be Rod Stewart. I am a respected businessman with children, I have never asked for free drinks. I pay my own way. 

'People do mistake me for Rod, but I always say I’m not him. I would like to shake Rod’s hand and say I am not an imposter. I love his music, but I wouldn’t pretend to be him. And I’ve never been to the Rockaways.'

Mr Anton was recently photographed by a star-struck fan on the Subway who mistook him for the singer. 'This is the way I look,' he said. 

This follows several reports about a bogus Rod Stewart operating in the Meatpacking district of Manhattan looking for free food and drinks. 

Stewart's manager Arnold Stiefel said: 'The real Rod has seen the [subway] picture, and he thought it was funny, but he said, "Please let people know it isn’t me".' 

According to  Stiefel, there has been a problem with impersonators for the past 15 years.

On one occasion a deputy sheriff from outside New Orleans rang claiming to have the star locked up in a drunk tank for being drunk and disorderly. 

'I said, "You'd better call the Dorchester in London because he's there right now." The real Rod... thought it was funny, but said let people know it wasn't me".' 

The real singer, however, is in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he is performing in Caeser's Palace before heading to Australia and New Zealand in the New Year.
