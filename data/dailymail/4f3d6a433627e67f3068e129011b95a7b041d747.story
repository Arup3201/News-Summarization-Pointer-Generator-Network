The doctor whose wife and two daughters were killed in a home invasion is 'happier and more joyful' now that he has found love again, his friends have said.

Dr William Petit, 55, became engaged to photographer Christine Paluf, 34, who volunteered for 
the Petit Family Foundation set up in his murdered family's memory, last week.

Speaking to People magazine, friends also revealed the doctor feared he would never be able to love again after his wife and daughters were killed by two men in Cheshire, Connecticut in 2007.

Dr Petit was beaten with a baseball 
bat and tied up by the two home invaders while his wife Jennifer, 48, was strangled and their daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, were left to die in a fire.

He managed to escape to a neighbourâ€™s house as his home was engulfed in flames.

Dr Petit, a diabetes specialist, have up practicing medicine and devoted his life to fighting for justice for his family, setting up the Petit Family Foundation.

In 2008, he met Paluf at a local country club, where she worked as a marketing director, and she offered her photography services to the foundation.

They began a relationship last summer and announced their engagement earlier this month - to the delight of his friends and relatives.

'This is something we'd hoped and prayed for, that Billy would one day find love again,' his sister-in-law Cindy Hawke-Renn told People magazine. 'He's happier and more joyful, lighter.'

Friend Kendra Dull added that, despite the 21-year age gap, the relationship seemed 'right' to her.

'She just tries to be there for him, listen when he needs her to listen and cry with him when he needs her to cry,' she told People.

'She knows there's enough room in his heart for all of them.'

Hawke-Renn, whose sister was Petit's wife Jennifer, recounted a conversation in which the bereaved doctor said he worried if he would ever be able to have another family.

He told her: 'I just don't know if I can love and cherish other children as much as I loved Hayley and Michaela.'

She assured him he would and was thrilled when he introduced Paluf. Other friends agreed his family would have wanted to see him happy in a new relationship.

Mrs Hawke-Petit's mother, Marybelle Hawke, welcomed the news of Dr Petit's engagement earlier this month.

'We're really excited and pleased that they've become engaged,' she said by telephone from Florida.

'I think that they seem to be very 
compatible. We've got to know her quite well.'

'I see a great change in him,' she 
said. 'I think he'll have pretty good sailing from now on. We felt he 
was a blank person for a long time.'

It comes after Dr Petit's moving tribute to his family as one of the killers was put on trial last October.

He said he had seriously 
considered suicide after the deaths, which had left a 'jagged hole in my heart'.

'I miss my entire family, my home, everything we had 
together,' he said. 'They were three special people.

'I lost my entire family. I lost the records of our shared lives together due to the fire. Thus I lost my past and my future.'

The two killers, Joshua Komisarjevsky and 
Steven Hayes - who blamed each other for escalating the violence - are 
on death row after being found guilty.

Komisarjevsky and Hayes broke into the Petit home early on July 23, 2007
after Komisarjevsky spotted Michaela Petit in a grocery store and made 
her his target.

William Petit's fears

Later that morning, Hawke-Petit drove to a bank, 
where she told a teller her family was being held hostage and she needed
$15,000 to pay off the captors.

A bank manager called police but
when authorities arrived at the Petit home, it was engulfed in flames. 
The police have been criticized as being slow to respond.

Hayes, convicted of raping and strangling Hawke-Petit and killing the girls, was sentenced to death in 2010.

Komisarjevsky, convicted of the 
killings and of sexually assault, was condemned to die last year but 
will be formally sentenced on January 27.

The Petit's memorial organisation helps educate 
young people, improve the lives of those with chronic illnesses and 
protect those affected by violence.
