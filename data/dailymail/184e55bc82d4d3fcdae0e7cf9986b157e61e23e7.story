Diego Costa may have taken the Premier League by storm since arriving at Chelsea last summer, but the Spain international is lagging behind opposite number Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the Champions League.

A £32million signing from Atletico Madrid in June last year, Costa hit the ground running in England, scoring seven times in his first four league games including a brace against Everton and a hat-trick against Swansea.

The 26-year-old has continued his impressive form for the league leaders and leads the way in the Premier League goalscoring charts with 17 from just 19 games.

But Costa has failed to have the same impact on the European stage and has failed to find the net in five Champions League group stage appearances this season.

The powerful striker has drawn a blank against Schalke and Sporting Lisbon twice while he was unable to make an impact as a half-time substitute during the 1-1 draw with Slovenian minnows Maribor. 

Jose Mourinho will be hoping that statistic comes to an end on Tuesday night when Chelsea travel to PSG for the first leg of their last-16 clash at Parc de Princes.

The Brazilian-born striker will return to the starting line up for the Blues following a three-game domestic ban and if Chelsea are to advance to the quarter-finals they will be relying on Costa to outperform PSG talisman Ibrahimovic.

The 33-year-old comes into the fixture having scored in each of his last two Ligue 1 games for Laurent Blanc's side and will be the main threat facing John Terry and Co in the Chelsea backline.

Ibrahimovic has made two fewer Champions League appearances than Chelsea hitman Costa this season but has outscored his opponent finding the net twice for the French champions.

Despite his struggles in Europe Costa is leading the way in the Premier League with 17 goals

The Sweden international scored PSG's second in a 3-1 win against Ajax in November before giving his side the lead against Barcelona, only to eventually lose the game 3-1 at the Nou Camp. 

The former AC Milan and Barcelona striker has featured in Europe's top club competition for 266 minutes compared to Costa's 307 minutes and has needed had only 11 shots to score his two goals.

Costa, meanwhile, has failed to fins the target from his 14 strikes at goal, but the former Atletico forward has tested the goalkeeper more with 63 per cent shooting accuracy compared to 50 per cent for Ibrahimovic.
