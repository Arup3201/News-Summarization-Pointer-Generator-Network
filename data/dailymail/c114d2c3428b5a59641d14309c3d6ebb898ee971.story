A police constable used his force's database to target vulnerable women for sex while on duty, a court was told today.

Pc Jasbir Singh Dhanda, 52, is accused of misusing the database while he was a serving officer with Derbyshire Police over a seven-year period.

The officer allegedly had sex with two women while he was working after tracking them down on the police systems.

Sex on duty: Pc Jasbir Singh Dhanda, 52, allegedly targeted vulnerable women he found on the police database, Nottingham Crown Court heard

One of his victims claimed he would ignore calls that came through on his police radio as he attempted to have sex with her.

Neil Moore, prosecuting, told Nottingham Crown Court today that the constable targeted three women in total because they were 'vulnerable' and he did not believe they would report him.

Even if they did, Dhanda, from Derby, thought their complaints would not be taken seriously due to their circumstances, Mr Moore added.

He is accused of 12 counts of misconduct in a public office and obtaining personal data through misuse of a police database.

The court heard Dhanda accessed the records of one of the complainants 100 times over a two-year period.

He met one of the women after she complained to the police about an incident involving her former partner.

Dhanda went round to her house the day after the incident 'to update her'.

He then allegedly performed a sex act on himself and touched her sexually before asking for her phone number.

Dhanda then visited her house for sex two or three times a week, day or night, the court heard.

Two years later, he turned up out of the blue to another address where she lived in the city, Mr Moore said.

He told her: 'At last, I've found you.'

Accused: The police officer, who is suspended from duty with Derbyshire Police, allegedly accessed the force database for his own purposes over a seven-year period

Mr Moore told the court Dhanda 
accessed 40 reports on 100 occasions between March 2008 and April 2010 
on the Guardian police database system relating to this complainant.

Another complainant said she felt compelled to do as Dhanda asked because he was a police officer.

Dhanda is alleged to have told the 
woman, who was a prostitute, there was a warrant for her arrest but that
he would not execute it if she got him some cocaine.

'Score for me and be a good girl and you'll be all right', he told her.

They then smoked a crack pipe together before he asked her for sex.

The woman told police she obtained drugs on 12 occasions for Dhanda. They had sex four or five of those times.

'It wasn't nice. It was intimidating. But he didn't hurt me.'

She added: 'He took advantage of me because I was vulnerable.'

A third complainant, with whom Dhanda 
had a relationship, said that he attempted to have sex with her while he
was on duty and would ignore calls that came through to his radio, 
telling her he was on a break.

Mr Moore said Dhanda used the database
to 'better enable him to carry out relationships with women who were 
vulnerable, capable of being taken advantage of or exploited'.

There was no policing reason he would have to access such records, he added.

Dhanda, who appeared in court from 
bail wearing a black suit and blue tie, is also alleged to have looked 
up his ex-wife and former partner along with a third woman on the police
database.

The police constable, who is suspended
from Derbyshire Police pending the outcome of criminal proceedings, 
faces seven counts of misconduct in a public office and five counts of 
obtaining personal data.

He denies all the charges.

Judge Michael Stokes QC adjourned the case until tomorrow, when the court will hear from the first of 14 witnesses.
