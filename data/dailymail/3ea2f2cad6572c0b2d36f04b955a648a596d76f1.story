University students have published an online guide and map which details the best places to smoke cannabis on campus without getting caught.

The Aberdeen Tab, a student-run online publication, has highlighted the three best places to smoke cannabis joints in the grounds of the University of Aberdeen without being 'busted'.

The article, written by Hal Duke - who is listed as having studied at the university - comes with its own detailed map 'for when times get tough' and points students in the direction of public places to 'enjoy a J in peace'.

The online article, written by Hal Duke who is listed as having studied at university, comes with a handy map 'for when times get tough' and points students in the direction of public places to 'enjoy a J in peace'

Among the 'best places' touted by the student publication is the iconic 13th century Balgownie Bridge over the River Don and an electricity substation near university accommodation.

The article has already been liked by more than 10,000 people on Facebook.

In the online piece, Mr Duke writes: 'Even with weed becoming more socially acceptable as an alternative (addition) to alcohol, there are still risks involved with smoking up in public.

'The threat of getting busted constantly hangs over you like untapped ash as you stand out in the open, nervously puffing on something that clearly isn't a cigarette.

'Even if you don't turn around to find the stern hand of a porter on your shoulder, it may just as easily be the eager hand of a fellow student looking to get in on something they didn't shell out for.

'Toke in fear no longer.'

He advises students take a walk to the secluded Seaton Gardens which involves climbing through an opening in the wall.

He claims the spot 'boasts 360 degree wall coverage to keep the worst of the wind from stealing the best of your smoke, benches to kick back on, and enough chill vibes to inspire several reggae albums'.

An electricity substation (pictured) is listed in the guide as the second best place to smoke cannabis. It is described as 'the ultimate in stealth spots for those concerned about bumping into any potential leachers'

He lists the electricity substation as option number two, describing it as 'the ultimate in stealth spots for those concerned about bumping into any potential leachers/porters/leaching porters'.

The third option, for those 'who like a little jaunt with their joint', is highlighted as Balgownie Bridge over the river Don.

He writes: 'Once there, you will be treated to a spectacular view across the Don where you can ponder the mysteries of the universe and inter-connectivity of nature in peace.'

A University of Aberdeen spokesman could not comment on whether the student would be spoken to about the online article but said: 'The University of Aberdeen has a zero-tolerance approach to drugs on campus. 

'The views expressed refer to a number of sites which are not part of the University's campus.

'The University signposts students concerned about drug misuse to relevant support services.'
