This sporty goldfish is not afraid of hitting the back of the net after being taught to play football like a pro.

Span the footballing fish can deftly nudge a submerged ball along the bottom of its tank into a Subbuteo goal.

Owner Peter Bettison, 80, has used an intensive training course to teach the talented fish how to score every time.

Limbering up: Span fixes its eye on the goal in its tank in Devon, where it has been practising with coach and owner 80-year-old Peter Bettison

Tense moment: The ball looks as though it may hit the post at the last minute

It can also play netball, swim through rings and limbo under tiny bars in his tank - that comes complete with a miniature football pitch.

Mr Bettison, of Exeter, Devon, honed Span's skills after sending off for a specialist fish training manual.

He rewards the young shoal-scorer with a nugget of food every time it hits the net - similar to the 'positive reinforcement' method used to teach tricks to dolphins.

Peter bought four-year-old Span - named after football legend Sir Stanley Matthews - in 2010 as a present for his wife Sheila who was in hospital.

He said: 'Basically you start gradually 
using a reward system - a bit like footballers' pay but fish food for it
 - to encourage the fish to first swim through a ring.

'Then gradually you work up to a six-inch tube for the fish to swim through, horizontal, then vertical.

'Then there is the limbo where it swims under a bar and finally you introduce the ball which is plastic and doesn't float.

Unlikely footballer: Although Span does not have a streamlined body, it makes a surprisingly effective striker

Pride and Joy: Peter Bettison from Exeter with his talented fish

'It has taken to it really well and seems to enjoy scoring goals. People say goldfish are not very bright and have no memory.

'What is slightly odd is that its is not built like an athlete, more like a swimming tennis ball.'

Peter now uses the fish's skills to raise money for Hospiscare.

Practice pitch: Span is able to put in hours of training with a scaled-down pitch that fits in its tank

Multi-talented: Not only can Span handle a football with skill, it can also play netball, swim through hoops and limbo thanks to Mr Bettison's guidance
