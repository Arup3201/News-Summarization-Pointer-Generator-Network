Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic's remarkable long-range goal against Southampton last season has earned a place in the Guinness World Records book.

Begovic scored in bizarre fashion at the Britannia Stadium last November when a long kick forward - just 12 seconds after kick-off - caught the wind and then bounced over opposite number Artur Boruc into the net.

The strike was measured at 91.9 metres (301ft 6in) and has now been registered as the 'longest goal scored in football' in the latest edition of the famous book of records.

Begovic told the club's website, www.stokecityfc.com: 'I feel amazing to be honoured in this way and as a goalkeeper I didn't expect this to happen, not for this type of record anyway. I will take it though and enjoy it.

'I really do appreciate this award and the certificate will certainly take pride of place on the wall at home.

'So thank you to everyone at Guinness World Records for presenting me with this wonderful award.'
