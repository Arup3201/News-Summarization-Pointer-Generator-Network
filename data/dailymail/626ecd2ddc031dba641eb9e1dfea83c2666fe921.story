In his own words, he was greedy, arrogant and invincible.

City trader James Sanders appeared to have it all – a £9million property portfolio including a mansion in Kensington, a stable of fast cars and a multi-milllion pound business.

But the 35-year-old City trader and his glamorous wife Miranda, 34, were in fact funding their luxurious lifestyle from illegal deals, thanks to secret financial information passed on by her sister and brother-in-law in America.

Heading for a fall: James Sanders with his wife Miranda. The father of two pleaded guilty last week to insider dealing

Yesterday the couple swapped their 
£5million Georgian mansion for a prison cell after both were jailed for 
insider dealing.

Sanders was sentenced to four years, while his wife got
ten months.

Southwark Crown Court heard how the 
pair pocketed more than £1.5million by placing bets on the stock market 
based on insider tips gleaned from Miranda’s brother-in-law Arnold 
McClellan, 52, a partner with financial firm Deloitte who handled major 
US company takeovers.

Sanders, who ran his own brokerage 
firm in London earning £1million a year, gleefully boasted: ‘I’m the 
golden boy coming home smelling of roses’.

The father of two used his profits to 
splash out on a five-storey property  worth £5million, originally 
intended as an investment.

He treated the Georgian mansion, just 
off Kensington High Street, to a £1million makeover complete with a 
£35,000 wine cellar in the basement.

When he snapped up the property for 
£1.1million less than the asking price, he bragged that his winning 
mantra was ‘buy at the point of maximum fear’ and said: ‘Once the credit
crunch is over I’m going to be quids in.’

Sanders also used the cash to pay off 
his mortgage on the couple’s £3.75million townhouse in Holland Park and 
allocated himself a £100,000 ‘car fund’ to pay for his 328 GTS and 575M 
Maranello Ferraris, a Maserati and Bentley.

When investigators raided his home, 
they found an extraordinary handwritten list in which Sanders 
meticulously set out his spending of £50,000 on Rolex watches, luxury 
holidays, designer clothing and fine wines.

He also splurged £60,000 on a diamond 
for his wife, £150,000 on improvements to the Holland Park home and 
£60,000 on premium bonds, while discussed giving his father, Tim, and Miranda’s 
father, Michael, £20,000 each.

Yesterday the court heard how the 
couple got rich thanks to tips on forthcoming acquisitions passed on by 
Miranda’s millionaire older sister Annabel McClellan, 39. She  is now 
serving 11 months in a US federal prison for obstructing an 
investigation into the racket.

The housewife, who lives in San 
Francisco, had daily conversations with her sister in which she was said
to have passed on confidential information from her husband about 
transactions involving five US companies.

The two families were exceptionally close and enjoyed equally opulent lifestyles.

McClellan, a mother of two, met her 
husband while working in Deloitte’s London office when she was in her 
early 20s. The couple married and moved to America in 1996, where she 
divided her time between renovating the family’s $2.1million 
(£1.3million) home in an upmarket neighbourhood, Bikram yoga and doing 
charity work.

But as investigators in the US and 
Britain were closing in on the insider dealing, the bored housewife 
began developing a sexually explicit social networking business. Called 
‘My Nookie’, it was billed as 'the app your sex life and social life 
can’t be without'.

Their scam was uncovered when the 
Financial Services Authority in Britain launched its first-ever joint 
investigation with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC), which led to Sanders’s brokerage firm, Blue Index, being shut 
down and the couple’s assets seized.

Investigators discovered 26million 
emails and 24,000 phone conversations which were automatically recorded 
at the Blue Index office. Many referred to deals based on the tips, 
while in some Sanders laughed at the prospect of getting caught.

List: James Sanders allocated himself a £100,000 car fund, and set aside £500,000 for 'miscellaneous' items, including watches, clothes, holidays and wine

He boasted to his father, a double 
glazing salesman: ‘There’s no doubt in my mind we’re gonna absolutely 
cane it over the next year or two because these tips are f***ing 
brilliant.’

Peter Carter QC, prosecuting, said the
plan was for Sanders to pay half of the profits to the McClellans, but 
investigators were unable to trace any money transfers.

The taped telephone calls in fact 
suggest that Sanders considered cheating the couple by siphoning off the
cash into a secret account.

After the tips made his clients more 
than £12million, Sanders planned to sell his firm for £8million, but he 
was arrested in May 2009 before he could cash in.

When questioned, Sanders claimed he barely knew Mr McClellan – but when they left Bishopsgate police station 
his wife immediately ran to the nearest phone box to call her sister.

Yesterday Andrew Radcliffe, defending 
Sanders, said: ‘He has expressed himself in this way that he acted out 
of greed, arrogance and a feeling at the time of invincibility.

‘He is embarrassed at the person he 
was and totally ashamed of his own conduct and also that he involved and
implicated others unjustly.’

Mr Justice Simon jailed Sanders for 
four years and he was disqualified from running a business for five 
years after admitting ten counts of insider dealing between October 2006
and February 2008.

He told Sanders: ‘You were the driving
force behind the criminality. You knew how the system worked and you 
traded jointly with your wife so as to generate large sums for the 
direct financial benefit of the two of you.’

Sanders’s wife, who runs an exclusive 
property business in Kensington and Chelsea, remained impassive as she 
stood by him in the dock, impeccably dressed in a tailored trouser suit 
and stilettos.

She received a ten-month sentence for three counts of insider dealing. Both had previously pleaded guilty.

James Swallow, 34, a fellow director 
of Blue Index, was also jailed for ten months after admitting three 
counts of insider dealing.

Senior trader Christopher Hossain, 36,
and Sanders’s friend Adam Buck, 35, were cleared of any involvement in 
the scandal after a trial last month.

In America Annabel McClellan was 
jailed in November last year after admitting obstructing justice for 
lying to SEC investigators.

She also paid $1million (£635,000) to 
settle an SEC lawsuit which alleged that she and her relatives netted 
$23million (£14.6million) from illicit trades.

As part of the settlement, in which 
she did not admit wrongdoing, the SEC agreed to drop its claims against 
her husband, who was allowed to quietly retire from his high-powered 
job.

The couple now face a confiscation hearing in which the FSA  will seek to claw back all of their assets.

They have already sold their Holland Park home and their Kensington mansion is on the market.
