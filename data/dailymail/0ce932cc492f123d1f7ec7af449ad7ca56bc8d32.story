Updating his Twitter account from the 26th floor of his Midtown apartment, scientist Gurinder Singh 'Mickey' Atwal tweeted that he was unable to escape with his wife and two-year-old son because the stairwells were blanketed with thick smoke.

As the fire raged, over 200 firefighters rushed to the 42-storey building at 500 West 43 Street in Manhattan to fight the blaze.

Atwal then dramatically revealed that he and his family had sought refuge on their balcony away from the suffocating smoke.

Eventually however, firefighters made it to Atwal after battling to reach them and others stranded by the fire which began on the 20th floor and escorted him and his family to safety.

FDNY spokesman Danny Glover revealed that the fire broke out shortly after 11 am and that one 27-year-old man died and one other was critically injured.

According to Glover, the two injured are both male and were transported to nearby hospitals after being found overcome by smoke in the stairwell.

'The main 
body of fire's been knocked down but there's still smoke conditions 
inside the building,' said Danny Glover, a fire department spokesman.

An official said that some residents who live on upper floors of the building had not been able to get out as of midday - however no one was dangerously trapped.

She ran down several flights of stairs until the smoke got too thick, then took the elevator to the ground floor.

She shivered in the cold, wearing only her workout shorts and a t-shirt. She managed to escape with only the clothes on her back and her water bottle.

'I left my phone and everything up there,' she told MailOnline.

John Lupiano said his 40th-floor apartment was completely engulfed in smoke - despite the flames starting 20 floors below.

'The smoke just permeated so quickly and densely,' he told MailOnline. 'Black, horrible smelling thick smoke.'

He led his wife and two sons down 40 floors in the stairwell. When they got to the 20s, they were nearly overcome by the smoke.

'In the stairwell it was more concentrated. I was worried because I could feel the breathing get harder, but what was the choice? To go back?' he said.

'The biggest fear is if you fall, you're gonna be consumed by the smoke.

'It was getting worse quickly. But then when we got to floor 18 it cleared out.'
