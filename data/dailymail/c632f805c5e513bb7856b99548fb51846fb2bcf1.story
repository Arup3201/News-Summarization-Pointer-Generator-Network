A shortage of UK lorry drivers caused by European rules is threatening the economic recovery and putting deliveries to shops and homes at risk, hauliers and MPs have warned.

The shortfall could lead to problems keeping the shelves stocked for Christmas and transporting the grit needed to keep roads safe in winter.

Thousands of British heavy goods vehicle drivers are retiring as the population ages, experts warn.

Too few newly-qualified replacements are being trained up in the UK to take their place.

And the problem has been made worse by a controversial EU directive, backed by Labour in 2009, which demanded experienced drivers take extra training. 

Drivers had until last Tuesday to qualify for a certificate of professional competence or face a £1,000 fine. 

But Tory MP Andrew Bridgen claims many decided to retire early or quit the industry instead.

Mr Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire and a qualified road haulage manager, said: ‘The shortage of HGV lorry drivers threatens growth in the UK economy.

‘We are still paying the cost of the previous Labour government’s slavish agreement to this and other EU directives. 

We already had and still have the safest and best regulated road haulage industry in Europe.’

A delegation from the Road Haulage Association is to meet Treasury officials this month to highlight the growing problem.

Meanwhile, the Freight Transport Association said the lack of drivers to deliver the goods could lead to a bleak Christmas for many families.

Sally Gilson, its skills policy development manager, said: ‘Our members are telling us they have genuine concerns over their ability to deliver Christmas this year. The pool of agency drivers is just not there.

‘And with the economy improving, a greater number is needed. 

However, this is not just a seasonal issue – our members recruiting full-time positions are struggling for applicants.’
