Steven Gerrard admitted retiring from England is one of the hardest decisions he has made but believes it will prolong his glittering Liverpool career.

On what was a hugely emotional day for the 34-year-old, Gerrard announced that "after much agonising" he would hand back the captain's armband and end a 14-year commitment to England that after his debut against Ukraine in May 2000, yielded 114 caps and 21 goals.

Walking away: Gerrard has announced his retirement from international football after 14 years

The tenacious midfielder has won the third highest number of caps for England:

2. David Beckham - 115

3. Steven Gerrard - 114

4. Bobby Moore - 108

5. Ashley Cole - 107

6. Bobby Charlton - 106

7. Frank Lampard - 106

8. Billy Wright - 105

10. Bryan Robson - 90

Gerrard, who returned to training with
 Liverpool's squad here in Boston yesterday, will lead his club back 
into the Champions League this September for the first time in five 
years and in order to be fit for the challenge, he accepted his workload
 needed to be managed.

But 
that did not make the situation any easier and the realisation he will 
no longer play for England is something Gerrard will need time adjusting
 to, particularly as he is "still grieving" after he was left 
demoralised by the way England's World Cup dreams unravelled in Brazil.

'It
 was a very difficult decision, something I have been contemplating for a
 long time - not just since the end of the World Cup,' said Gerrard. 
'It's a decision I've taken very seriously and it has been tough. It has
 swung both ways at times and I've had to take an awful lot of advice .

'I
 haven't made my decision on the back of (what happened at) the World 
Cup. I've made my decision on my age, on my body, on being fair to 
Liverpool Football Club, being respectful to them especially with the 
Champions League back - that was a huge factor.

'To
 ask my body now, the way it is and what it has been through, to play 
international football and domestic football was too much of an ask. But
 it is strange in a way because I still feel as though I could play for 
England in September, October, November, I'm still in great physical 
decision.

'But over the 
next two, three, four years, the best thing for my body, where I stand 
now, is to step aside out of the international fold and give my body the
 best chance to perform well, certainly over the next year while I'm 
contracted to Liverpool.

Who should be England's next captain?

'It's
 certainly one of the toughest I've had to make since I turned 
professional at 18 but I have come to the decision and I feel as if I 
have made the right decision. I would like to thank everyone who has 
been part of my international career.'

Gerrard,
 who insisted he would always be there to continue his "strong 
relationship" with the Football Association hinting , added in an 
interview on FA TV: 'I was asked questions during the World Cup, before 
the World Cup, after the World Cup to make a decision on my future, but 
it wasn't the right time.

'It
 was important that I came away from football, I had some time to be 
alone, be with my close family and friends and discuss and what was 
going to be the best decision for me moving forward.

'The
 first time I spoke to Roy Hodgson properly was this week, I tried to 
have an initial chat with him straight after the World Cup, but I was 
too emotional to talk to him. I'm still very upset with how the World 
Cup went and I needed time to come away, gather my thoughts, clear my 
head and make sure it was the right decision because it was so big.'

Hodgson
 made Gerrard England captain before Euro 2012, having previously worked
 with him at Liverpool, and he the head coach sent him into 
international retirement with a suitably glowing tribute.

'He
 is an incredible man and a fantastic footballer who we have all been 
blessed to see in an England shirt so often,' said Hodgson. 'It is never
 by coincidence that people reach such a staggering figure as 114 caps, 
it is a mark of his wonderful talent allied to a huge drive and 
determination to live up to the highest standard.'

There
 is little doubt he will leave a gaping hole in England's midfield and 
Jordan Henderson, who has thrived for Liverpool and established himself 
as international regular under Gerrard's wing, put the challenge Hodgson
 faces of trying to find a player and leader into context when he 
described Gerrard as being "irreplaceable".

'Stevioe
 is one of the best players this country has ever seen and one of the 
best leaders so he is a big loss for England,' said Henderson. 'But at 
the same time it is a big plus for Liverpool, he will be fresher, have 
more in his legs especially with Champions League.

'That’s
 the way he will be looking at it, he will be ready to play all the 
games this season for Liverpool and that’s a plus for him and Liverpool.
 How much did the World Cup hurt him? He was absolutely devastated, just
 like everyone else to be fair. His leadership skills are fantastic and 
everyone was disappointed and no more so than him.

'I
 wasn’t sure (whether he would step down) as he loves football and you 
can see that every time he puts on the England shirt. I knew it would be
 a big decision for him and he did the right thing going away and 
spending time with his family to think about it. Everyone just has to 
respect his decision.'

Liverpool,
 meanwhile, will officially make their sixth and seventh signings of the
 summer in the next 24 hours; both Loic Remy, the France striker, and 
Divock Origi, the Belgium international, have flown to Boston to 
complete medicals.

Remy has 
agreed personal terms after Liverpool's #8.5million bid was accepted by 
Queens Park Rangers, while Origi will cost around #10million. He, 
however, will return to LIlle to spend next season at his old club on 
loan to gain experience.
