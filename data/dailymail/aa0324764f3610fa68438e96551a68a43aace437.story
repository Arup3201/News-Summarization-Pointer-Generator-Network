Planning: Nick Ross and his wife, Sarah Caplin, (pictured) will update their historic property making it into six storeys with five bedrooms

Former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross has won planning permission to 'substantially demolish' his £17m Grade II listed home and replace it with a new six-storey, five-bedroom home.

The 66-year-old television presenter was at the Westminster Council planning meeting himself last night to hear his extensive and controversial plans for the historic building described as being like Marmite - with people either loving it or hating it.

But he was given permission to go ahead with his £10m building project on the elegant house between Notting Hill and Hyde Park in west London.

Apart from a few tweaks in the 
exterior design, the plans were agreed by Westminster 
Council’s Planning Sub-Committee last night, with chairman Robert Davis praising the design.

He said the design of the house was 'one of those things, you either like it or you don't like it, a bit like Marmite.

'I am afraid that I really like it.'

The
new property, which will keep its Georgian facade, will boast a garage,
a two-storey basement, swimming pool, gym, projection room, staff 
quarters and a wine cellar, and could be worth up to £40m once it is 
finished.

Proposals also include transforming 
the exterior by adding a series of pergolas to the garden and a set of 
balconies to the house itself, giving views over Orme Square in leafy 
Bayswater.

As it stands: this is what the Grade II listed Georgian Villa looks like at the moment

Planning officers had received 19 objections from local residents, and just four letters of support for the transformation of the property which Mr Ross and his wife Sarah Caplin paid £17m for last November.

Last year it emerged that Nick Ross and 
his wife Sarah Caplin had sold another luxury property for £35m - more than 40 times 
what they paid for it 20 years ago.

The
value of that house, which was bought by Saudi businessman Wafic Said, 
had been significantly raised by extensive renovations.

They bought the 1908 town house in Notting Hill, west London in 1993 for £950,000.

They stold it to the financier Khaled Said and his wife Diane Elisabeth for about £35million.

The TV presenter, who co-founded Childline, split the proceeds among his three grown-up sons and a charity.

Christopher Wright, secretary of Bayswater Residents Association, had told planners: 'We do not consider that introducing a modern style of design needs to be out of keeping with the architectural style of the houses in the square, but the scale of the extension is very large and we feel will be obtrusive.'

Mr Davis granted approval on the conditions that one of the proposed pergolas be removed, the roof be pulled back slightly to prevent overlooking into neighbours’ homes, and that the gates be made of railings.

He said: 'It is also very important to bring this building back into use.'

The proposal had been opposed by angry local residents who claimed Ross and his wife’s plans for the Georgian villa, which dates back to 1826, were 'out of character' with the area.

Ross, who stepped down from presenting Crimewatch five years ago, was co-host for many years to Jill Dando, who was shot dead in 1999

Speaking
after the meeting he said: 'I am sorry we have lost the pergola, it 
doesn’t cause any problems with the adjoining premises.

'But yes, overall
I am glad that we got it.'
