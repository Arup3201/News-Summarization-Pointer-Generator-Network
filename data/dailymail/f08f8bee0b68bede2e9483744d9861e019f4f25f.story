This is the man who wrote-off a video showing a group of Syrian children being tortured as 'British propaganda', happily walking the streets of London.

Expensively dressed and clutching his briefcase Dr Fawas Akhras is no usual pedestrian, he is the father-in-law of hated tyrant Bashar al-Assad and apologist for his brutal regime and its atrocities.

Akhras, whose daughter Asma is married to the Syrian president, was probably on his way to work as a cardiologist on London's exclusive Harley Street.

Apologist: The father-in-law of brutal Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Dr Fawas Akhras, has been spotted walking down a London street

Looking down as he strolled the quiet Acton street, he then jumped into a luxury BMW.

Neighbours said that he has not been seen in the area since May but he reappeared this week.

Earlier this year a series of explosive emails showed that he was backing his tyrant son-in-law and what he was doing to his own people.

He has also defended the regime publicly in an interview.

In correspondence to al-Assad, signed off with 'warmest', he rubbished UN worries about the number of deaths in Syria.

He also branded the West hypocrites for taking action to stop Wall Street protestors, and torture in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib jails as well as setting out a 13-point critique explaining why criticisms of al-Assad's regime were wrong, calling it the 'direct the 
argument toward the other side.'

Off to work: Akhras gets into his BMW and was perhaps off to Harley Street where he works as a cardiologist

Denials: The cardiologist has defended the actions of his son-in-law, revealed in e-mails and interviews he has given

Mass grave: A funeral of 35 victims of shelling in the town of Artouz, near Damascus, shows the scale of violence in the country

Astonishingly he also compared the Syrian uprising to the London riots and claimed the use of armed force against the people of Homs was justified because lives were at stake – and after all, David Cameron had threatened to use the army against rioters.

‘When the London riots burst out and Mr Cameron said he would get the army out, now would you compare that to Homs?' he said in an interview.

‘What would you do? Just watch them killing you? You have a responsibility to ensure the security of your people.’

It was then pointed out to him that the riots in London had been quelled without the authorities killing anyone, to which Dr Akhras, co-chairman of the British-Syrian Society, replied: ‘We are not as sophisticated as the Metropolitan Police or Scotland Yard.’

He went on to tell the Daily Telegraph that the 
death toll in Syria of 7,000 was ‘much better’ than the Libyan one, 
which some rebel reports put at 50,000.

Head down: Fawas Akhrashas not been seen at his Acton home since May until he turned up this week, neighbours said

It came as Britain said it is set to increase its support for Syrian opposition forces in their fight against the nation's brutal dictator Bashar al-Assad, William Hague revealed today.

But the cash boost will only come in the form of 'non-lethal' support - including the training of citizen journalists to 'get the word out' about the atrocities.

It will not, however, involve sending armaments to the beleaguered rebels, the British Foreign Secretary added.

'Given the scale of death and suffering 
and the failure so far of the diplomatic process we will, over the 
coming weeks, increase our practical but non-lethal support,' he said.
