A British woman dying of cancer faces being separated from her American husband after UK immigration officials say he can only stay in the country if she gets a job.

Sally Piasecki, 63, from Wallington in Surrey, fled an abusive relationship in 1996 and moved to Florida in the U.S. where she settled and married master carpenter Walter Piasecki.

She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2008 and when doctors told her she had a maximum of 12 years to live, the couple decided to sell their Florida home and move back to the UK in 2012.

But now the couple have been told that Mr Piasecki has no right to remain in the country unless she has a job paying at least £18,600, despite the fact the disease has left her  disabled.

Mrs Piasecki wanted to spend her remaining years with her family, including her two daughters Nicola, 42, and Joann, 40, but now faces being separated from her husband.

She said: 'My parents were both in the navy, I'm a true-blue Brit. But I am disabled, I am losing the use of my left arm with thoracic outlet syndrome, my left side is wasting away.

'I don't have thyroids after I developed cancer. I will be visiting the Royal Marsden [Hospital] for the rest of my life.

'We gave up everything we owned in America, so I could spend my final years with my family. My husband looks after me, I can't even get in the shower on my own.

'I've only got a few years left and they are doing this to me.'

The couple sold their home in Florida so they could be closer to Mrs Piasecki's family after she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2008

A change in immigration rules in 2012 brought in the ruling, which states returning British citizens must have a job that pays more than £18,600 if they wish to bring their partner with them.

Last month they were told Mr Piasecki was being denied the right to remain, even though he works as her carer.  

Since July 2012, the Immigration Rules have contained a financial requirement to be met by a person applying for entry clearance to remain in the UK.

The minimum income threshold for a couple is £18,600 - which rises to £22,400 where the application includes sponsorship of a non-EU child.

However, the financial requirement does not apply to a child who is a British citizen.

Acceptable 'evidence' includes bank statements  on official bank stationery, electronic bank statements,  building society statements or a letter from a financial institution regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority for money in overseas accounts.

Mrs Piasecki added: 'I have lived away from my children for so long and now we are reunited they want to take my husband away.'

She has been told that if she wants to stay with her husband she should return to the States, but with her conditions it is unlikely she will find employment.

Without a job she would be ineligible for medical insurance, making hospital bills expensive.

A Home Office spokesman said applications were considered on their individual merits, 'including any compelling and compassionate circumstances, and in line with the immigration rules'.

Her fight has been taken on by Wallington and Carshalton MP Tom Brake.

He said: 'Every now and again there are immigration cases where there is a need for the Home Office to show flexibility and compassion and this is one of those cases.

'This is a couple who have been married for many years and who want to live with their family in the UK and can not return to America for medical reasons.

'I hope it might still be possible to allow them to remain in the UK. I will continue to see what other options might be open in terms of right of appeal.'
