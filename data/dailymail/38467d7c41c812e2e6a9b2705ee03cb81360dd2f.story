Connect: David Cameron, will be urged to adopt policies which appeal to the 'strivers'

Forty Tory MPs are behind a Blue Collar Conservatives Group set up to woo back aspirational voters lost by the party, it emerged last night.

David Cameron, who has faced criticism that he and his Cabinet are ‘out of touch’, will be urged to adopt policies which appeal to the ‘strivers’.

The group will try to champion the plight of the socio-economic ‘C2 and D’ groups, the struggling private sector workers who helped Margaret Thatcher secure her election victories.

Carlisle MP John Stevenson said: ‘The Conservative Party already has a lot of policies which appeals to this section of society but we have not been able to channel that into an electoral alliance on the ground.’

He admitted that the row over class which had engulfed the party had not helped, adding that ‘the Conservative Party has certainly scored some own goals recently.’

Mr Stevenson said Blue Collar Conservatives would call on the Government to raise the tax threshold to be in line with the minimum wage.

Clark Vasey, founder and co-ordinator of the group, said: ‘You don’t have to work in a factory to support us, it is about sharing the same values.’

Mr Vasey, an aviation security consultant, said while he was now middle-class, he identified with the values of his factory worker father and his shop assistant mother, who had left school at 14.

He said the Prime Minister was doing a good job and had recognised the ‘strivers’ in his conference speech, but he added that ‘perception matters, and there is a perception that the Tory party is out of touch’.

The group has the backing of 40 MPs so far, including Mr Stevenson and Yorkshire MP Philip Davies.Mr Vasey wrote to all Conservative MPs shortly before their party conference.

In the same week, former party deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft identified ‘Blue Collar Tories’ as the key to winning the 2015 election.

At the last General Election, the Tories won 29 per cent of these voters, compared with 19 per cent who voted Labour. Now, 25 per cent say they will vote for Labour, with 20 per cent intending to vote Conservative again.
