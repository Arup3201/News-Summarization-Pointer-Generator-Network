It looks like an electric wheelchair crossed with a recliner, it's controlled by two joysticks at either side - and Toyota believes it might be the future of transport.

Toyota's i-Real electric vehicle was one of the more surreal cars on show at the Beijing Motor Show this year - others included a drop-top electric version of the VW beetle.

The show attracted 2,000 companies from 36 countries - and 84 new vehicles were unveiled at the show, a sign that the Beijing show has increasing clout in the car market.

Many Western and Japanese car manufacturers showed off new models - but Chinese companies unveiled their own rivals.

Companies such as Toyota also unveiled China-only models - including hybrid cars and SUVs, many of which are also built in China.

President Akio Toyoda said: 'We would like to put smiles on the faces of our Chinese customers with hybrid technology. I want the people of China to be able to experience the beauty of hybrid technology through a hybrid car born in China.'

Many of the cars on display were SUV and off-road vehicles - a reflection of China's increasing wealth, but also of the terrible state of the country's roads, many of which are riddled with potholes.

MG also unveiled a concept car, the Icon - showing off how the company has moved on since the formerly British car firm was taken over by Shanghai-based SAIC.

Toyota is no stranger to odd car concepts - having already unveiled a car that can change its whole look in an instant.

The Fun-Vii, which stands for 
‘vehicle interactive internet’, is a concept car with a bodyshell made 
of touch-screen panels that not only allow the driver to change the 
pattern on display but also connect the car to the dealership’s website 
for a check-up.

It even greets its driver with a message that flashes up on the door.

Good call: The Fun-Vii is a car that thinks it's a smartphone

Toyota showed off the unique 
car ahead of the Tokyo Motor Show today, with company president Akio 
Toyoda saying: ‘A car must appeal to our emotions. If it’s not fun, it’s
not a car.’

The
car giant has no plans to put Fun-Vii into production just yet, but 
explained that it’s an example of the kinds of technologies that it 
could incorporate into designs in the future.

It said in a statement: ‘It heralds Toyota’s vision of a future where people, cars and society are linked.’

Smart: The car can display various graphics on its interior or exterior

Two other electric Toyota concept cars have also been revealed.

The FT-EV III is a four-seater electric vehicle based on the Toyota iQ.

Equipped with a lithium-ion battery, it achieves an estimated cruising range of 65 miles on a fully charged battery.

Toyota is developing EV 
technology with the aim of launching a vehicle suitable for 
short-distance travel in 2012, when the plug-in market comes to the UK.

The
FCV-R (Fuel Cell Vehicle – Reality & Revolution) concept, 
meanwhile, is a practical, family sized vehicle fuelled by hydrogen.

This concept model represents the next step towards the commercial launch of a Toyota fuel cell vehicle by 2015.

This should be able to reach 430 miles on one charge.
