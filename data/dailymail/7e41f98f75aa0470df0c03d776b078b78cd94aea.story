The wife of a footballer has upset fans after she said she 'hated' living in Swansea when their home was targeted by thieves.

Swansea City player Garry Monk had his house broken into last weekend and crooks stole watches, jewellery, two laptops, mobile phones and a Swansea kitbag marked with the number 16.

The burglars struck at some point between 9am on Friday and 2.45pm on Monday afternoon - while Mr Monk was having an operation to remove cartilage and bone from his left knee.

Operation: Swansea City star Garry Monk was having a knee operation when thieves broke into his home last weekend. He has appealed for anyone with information about the burglary to let get in contact with police

But his wife Lexy Blackwell has now annoyed locals by tweeting: 'I hate living in Swansea. I'd do anything for Garry to get a move.'

After an angry reaction from fans, she deleted the tweet and apologised yesterday saying: 'Apologies if I've offended anyone. It's my birthday, I'm 6 months pregnant with twins and hurt over what has happened/people being so nasty.

'Garry would never jeopardise his career or leave cos I'm having a bad day & I would never 'demand' or ask him2. He loves Swansea & hopes his future is here xx Sorry xx'

One tweeter said: 'Swans has made Garry the player he is. What happened to ur family is horrible but show some respect. U live better life than most.'

Apology: Lexy tweeted an apology yesterday saying her husband's future was with the club and he wouldn't jeopardise his career. Mr Monk, (right) 34, used his own account to appeal for information about the break in

Earlier in the week, Mr Monk, 34, used his own Twitter account to spell out his unhappiness at the theft.

He wrote: ‘Thanks everyone for your support. It's the 2 mac book laptops stolen that have all the family photos and videos on that is most upsetting.

‘Anyone who has any info leading to the finding of whoever did this or the recovery of any items that were taken will be generously rewarded.’

The former team captain has been at Swansea for nine and a half years.
