The millionaire boss of French technology giant Dassault Systemes could become the latest Gallic tycoon to quit France over looming massive tax hikes on the super-rich.

Bernard Charles, 55, has revealed he is considering joining thousands of wealthy French fleeing President Francois Hollande’s new tax regime.

Asked by French daily Le Monde if he would be considering his board’s advice to leave France, Mr Charles replied: 'So far I have taken no decision and am looking into all aspects of it.

'But to be clear, this isn’t about plans for a 75 per cent tax on all earnings above a million euros - even if I do think that tax above a certain level is confiscatory.'

Mr Charles sold all his £24million worth of shares in Dassault Systemes - which makes software for industry - last year.

Asked if this was a sign he was about to quit, he answered: 'I had to do that to pay other taxes related to the purchase of other shares, but it does show how heavy taxes are these days.

'But if I find I can no longer buy and sell shares in the company, I will leave.'

He also revealed that other highly-paid Dassault executives had left France, adding: 'I can’t say how many, but not as many as those that want to.'

His concerns of crippling new taxes on the rich come after optician chain tycoon Alain Afflelou - who has an estimated £190million fortune - said last year he was moving to Britain to pay less.

Film star Gerard Depardieu and France’s richest man Bernard Arnault both announced last year they also wanted to move abroad.

Depardieu has now moved to Russia while LMVH luxury goods boss Mr Arnault is applying for residency in Belgium.
