A modern twist on the traditional nativity story would see Jesus born in a budget hotel in Yorkshire and be given gifts by 'wise man' Brian Cox, a poll says.

The Bible Society sent out a survey to ask people to create their own 21st-century version of the tale.

Physicist Professor Cox - a noted atheist - was chosen as one of the three wise men but instead of bearing gold, frankincense or myrrh, he would be bringing the newborn a pair of socks or a chocolate orange, respondents said.

Yorkshire was seen as the alternative to Bethlehem and the birth would take place in a Travelodge or Premier Inn.

A thousand people were asked to choose between alternative elements to create their modern story as part of an exercise to make the public think about the meaning of Christmas, the Telegraph reports.

A garden shed, budget hotel or a bus stop were the options given for the birth and other wise men included broadcaster Sir Trevor McDonald, who has described himself as 'not a religious person' and Sir Richard Branson, who has also stated that he doesn't believe in God.

Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, only received nine per cent of the vote to become one of the wise men although he scored three times higher than Chancellor George Osborne.Â

Presents for the baby Jesus were ranked as chocolate orange, which scored 14 per cent of the vote, or other choices included an iTunes voucher or a Furby boom.

Swindon came last as an alternative setting for the birth of Christ with the Dales scooping the top spot.

The most popular choice of character in a nativity play was angels, which got 40 per cent of the female vote.

Joseph was not as popular as the innkeeper or a camel but still more popular than King Herod.

Matthew Van Duyvenbode, head of campaigns at the Bible Society, told the Telegraph: 'By encouraging people to think about the nativity in terms of today's ordinary experiences, we hope that they will revisit one of the world's best-known stories with a fresh perspective.'
