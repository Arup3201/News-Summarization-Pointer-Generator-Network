A computer designed to tell witty one-liners has been criticised for being sexist and un-PC.

Scientists at the University of Edinburgh created the software to tell one-line jokes using a simple set of rules in which a statement is followed up with an amusing punchline, such as 'I like my coffee like I like my war...cold'.

However, some of the lines the computer has produced have been criticised for being sexist or in bad taste including 'I like my men like I like my acorns...buried' and 'I like my women like I like my gas...natural.'

A computer designed by the University of Edinburgh to tell witty one-liners has been criticised for being sexist. The software creates jokes using a simple set of rules but has ended up comparing men and women to different objects such as 'I like my women like I like my gas...natural'

I like my women like I like my gas...Natural.

I like my men like I like my acorns...Buried.

I like my boys like I like my sectors...Bad.

I like my men like I like my monoxide...Odourless.

I like my men like I like my court...Superior.

I like my coffee like I like my war...Cold.

I like my relationships like I like my source...Open.

I like my fish like I like my text...Raw.

I like my business like I like my fish...Small .

The software was based on the comedy of stars such as Tommy Cooper, Les Dawson, Tim Vine and Stewart Francis - all renowned for their one-line humour.

Yet the software has ended up with a politically incorrect approach to the comedy by producing jokes that some people consider to be sexist. 

While other jokes are more surreal than funny.

The computer software works by finding 'unlikely pairings of words and to make a connection between them.'

According to reports in The Telegraph, the computer most commonly creates jokes that compare men or women to objects.

Such jokes include: 'I like my women like I like my gas...natural', 'I like my men like I like my court...superior' and 'I like my men like I like my acorns...buried.'

Jokes that erred more on the side of surrealism included 'I like my men like I like my court...superior' and 'I like my fish like I like my text...raw.'

David Matthews, a computer scientist who helped develop the software, told The Telegraph that volunteers laughed when they were told the computerised jokes.

However, they laughed more at man-made humour.

Matthews added that the software would need to 'develop cultural awareness' if the jokes were to improve.

He told The Telegraph: 'Computers have an advantage over people in that they can process masses of information, so we fed computers a wealth of material from which they extracted creative and unusual word combinations to fit our joke template.

Dr Matthews is presenting the software at the Association for Computational Linguistics conference  in Bulgaria.

Comedians including Tommy Cooper, pictured, Tim Vine and Stewart Francis are renowned for their brand of one-liner comedy. The software was created to try and mimic this type of humour but needs more 'cultural awareness' to become as funny as human comedians
