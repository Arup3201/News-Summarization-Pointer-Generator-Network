Julie Coade, 71, was crushed to death by a ride-on mower as she was cutting her lawn in Trallong, Brecon

A grandmother was crushed to death by her ride-on mower while she was cutting her lawn in preparation for a church fundraiser.

Julie Coade, 71, was killed in the freak accident while trimming her back garden lawn in Trallog, near Brecon, in August this year.

The keen gardener had been tidying up her lawn just one day before the fundraiser when the mower toppled over on a steep bank, crushing her underneath. 

One of her neighbours rushed to help and heaved the machine away from Mrs Coade, but she could not be saved.

At an inquest into her death, the court heard how Mrs Coade was planning to open up her garden the next day to help raise money for the village church.

Neighbour Paul Crowhurst told the inquest: 'I was horrified to see her underneath the lawnmower.

'I just grabbed hold of the mower, heaved it off her and screamed for help.'

Mr Crowhurst also told the inquest that the pensioner regularly used her lawnmower for 'whizzing along in her garden'.

He said: 'She looked very happy and very confident with it. I'd seen her mow the lawn on several occasions.'

Despite Mr Crowhurst's efforts to revive his neighbour, paramedics could not save Mrs Coade, the court heard. 

Powys coroner Andrew Barkley recorded an accident death verdict.

He said that Mrs Coade had suffered a compression of the chest and died from traumatic asphyxia. 

The open garden event was cancelled as a mark of respect to Mrs Coade. 

Mrs Coade was a community councillor in Trallong until 2013. She was also a member of the village Women's Institute, the Trallong Ladies Choir and a keen fundraiser for Cancer Research.

Friend Peter Thole said: 'She was a tireless fundraiser with a heart of gold.'
