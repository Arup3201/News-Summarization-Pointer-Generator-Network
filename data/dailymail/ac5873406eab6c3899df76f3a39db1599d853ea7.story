 A doctor who panicked when a spider fell into her lap as she was driving lost control of her car and crashed head-on into an oncoming vehicle, killing its elderly driver, a court has heard.

Dr Amy Elizabeth Walpole, 38, who suffers from arachnophobia, went into a ‘blind panic’ when the creature fell from the sun visor.

The GP was seen waving her arms frantically behind the wheel of her red sports car as she tried to brush it off before she swerved and smashed straight into 87-year-old John Evans’s car coming the other way.

Mr Evans, who suffered fractures and damage to his heart, was able to walk from his car to an ambulance after the crash but died the following day.

Walpole, who pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, was spared a jail sentence.

Mr Evans’s family had asked for her to be treated leniently because of her ‘good reputation’ as a GP.

She was instead banned from driving for 12 months and told to carry out community service and pay a fine. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years in prison.

Sentencing the family doctor at Llanelli Magistrates’ Court, Judge David Powells said: ‘What we are dealing with is a tragic accident.’

He told the court there was no suggestion Walpole had been driving irresponsibly, adding: ‘This is not a case for prison.’

Arachnophobia – a combination of the Greek words for spider and fear – affects almost 80 per cent of young British adults to some degree, according to the Zoological Society of London.

When sufferers see a spider, they can become extremely upset, have trouble breathing, sweat excessively or even experience heart problems.

Women have been found to be more than twice as likely to be scared of spiders as men. And in a recent poll, 52 per cent of women said not being afraid of spiders was the sign of a ‘real man’.

Famous arachnophobes are said to include singer Justin Timberlake, former England rugby player Lewis Moody and author JK Rowling – who included giant man-eating spiders in her Harry Potter series.

A YouGov poll last year revealed that arachnophobia was the fourth most common phobia in the UK. It was beaten by a fear of heights (acrophobia), a fear of snakes (ophidiophobia), and a fear of public speaking (glossophobia).

In 2013, NHS England endorsed an iTunes app which claimed to help cure arachnophobia by exposing sufferers to increasingly realistic photographs of spiders.

Despite the crippling fear they arouse in millions of people, just four of the 40,000 types of spider in the world are deadly to humans – and none of them can be found in the UK.

He also paid tribute to Mr Evans as a well-respected local man ‘who drove with confidence and caution’.

Walpole, of Penymynydd, near Llanelli, South Wales, was driving her red Mazda MX-5 to work around 9am on November 11, 2013, when she crashed into Mr Evans’s white Suzuki Alto on a rural road in Carmarthenshire.

A witness saw her ‘waving her arms around before the car swerved across into the oncoming lane’, the court was told.

John Allchurch, defending, said Walpole was incredibly afraid of spiders, adding: ‘It was a large spider which she was terrified of and tried to flick out of the window.’

Prosecutor Vaughan Pritchard Jones said: ‘An eyewitness following in the car behind Walpole said there was nothing untoward about her speed and the conditions were good. The road was not wet. A collision investigator said that could not have been the cause for the accident.’  

Mr Pritchard Jones continued: ‘Walpole [said] a spider had dropped from the sun visor, landing in her lap. She has a fear of spiders and tried to throw it out of the window. 

‘As a result of the situation with a loss of concentration she drifted across the road causing the collision.’ The prosecutor also told the court it was the second head-on collision Walpole had been involved in over the last five years.

On the previous occasion she was working in Europe and forgot which side of the road she was meant to be driving on. She was not charged for that incident.

As well as the year-long driving ban, Judge Powells ordered Walpole to carry out 80 hours of community service and pay court costs of £85 and a £60 victim surcharge. Arachnophobia can be disruptive for sufferers.

They often become extremely upset when they see a spider and can also experience physical symptoms of panic, such as nausea, trouble breathing, chest pain and a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia). 

In November it emerged that 34-year-old Aggie Dabska has kept the windows of her home in Cardiff shut for three years because there are spiders living in an outside tree.

Last year, a 44-year-old businessman who had part of his brain removed to treat his seizures was also inadvertently cured of his fear of spiders.
