Abattoirs providing the majority of British supermarkets with fresh pork use a stunning method that campaigners claim causes the animals 'severe distress' before they are slaughtered.

MailOnline has learned LIDL, the Co-operative and Waitrose source all of their pig meat from plants using carbon dioxide to knock out the animals.

Sainsbury's said the 'majority' of their pork is sourced from CO2 plants and ASDA's suppliers use the gas too.

Tesco now wants every one of its plants to adopt the same method by 2018. It did not disclose the proportion which already do. 

Researchers and welfare groups say it is 'aversive' to the animals who can suffer for 'up to 30 seconds' before losing consciousness.

Morrisons slaughters '100 per cent' of its fresh pork in its own abattoirs and uses electric stunning, which has drawn its own condemnation.

During the CO2 stunning process Tesco wants implemented, groups of pigs are mechanically herded into cages which are then lowered into pits with high carbon dioxide concentration.

Panic: CO2 stunning has been deemed humane because the pigs are moved in groups before they are stunned, but they can suffer for 'up to 30 seconds' when they are in the high concentration pits

Suffocating: CO2 is aversive to the pigs' breathing and can cause them 'severe distress', campaigners say

The procedure before stunning is considered humane because pigs naturally move around in groups without human interaction.

But they can get stuck the wrong way in the machinery that shepherds them - and become frightened.

When they are lowered into high concentrations of carbon dioxide, which is aversive to their breathing, they panic and kick out for 'a period of up to 30 seconds' before losing consciousness.

In emails revealed to MailOnline, Tesco says it wants the plants to use a machine called the Butina backloader or an equivalent stunning system by December 31, 2017.

Footage obtained from a plant in North-west Europe - using that very machine - shows the animals climbing over each other and gasping for breath as they enter the CO2 pits.

The gas 'induces respiratory distress, causing hyperventilation and a sense of breathlessness,' researchers say.

As one cage is brought to the surface, another is lowered into the pit and the cycle continues.

Animal welfare group Eyes on Animals, who filmed inside the plant, says the pigs are 'out of sight out of mind until they come back up and their bodies are no longer reacting'.

Robert Hubrecht, Chief Executive of the Humane Slaughter Association told MailOnline: 'As with many gas killing systems, carbon dioxide partly acts by displacing oxygen so the brain cannot function and brain death ensues.

'Carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid with a low pH when it meets moisture and probably because of this, inhalation of carbon dioxide at high concentrations causes irritation of the nasal mucosal membranes and lungs.'

He added that all available commercial methods for the stunning and slaughter of pigs have their disadvantages, and the use of CO2 is 'often the most reliable' for large operations.

'Looking to the future, further research into inert gas mixtures and other controlled atmosphere systems might well lead to welfare benefits,' he said.

Their director Lesley Moffat told MailOnline: 'I think Tesco rushed into making a really, really big decision that has an impact on animal welfare for years to come and on slaughterhouses.

'They made the wrong decision because they're expecting slaughterhouses that don't yet have the CO2 system to install it when maybe five to ten years down the road, it could be banned.

'It means a lot of animals will be slaughtered in a way that isn't ideal.'

A survey carried out by the Food Standard Agency in 2013 found that a similar number of pigs were stunned using electricity and carbon dioxide - but the gas method was far more efficient.

Of the 167,325 pigs it recorded slaughtered one week, 80,768 were stunned electrically at 116 plants. Whereas 86,456 were stunned using 'high concentration' CO2 at just seven abattoirs.

Electric stunning knocks the pigs out instantly, but the herding leading up to it causes them more stress than during gas stunning because they move in single file and they can see the animal in front being stunned.

Donald Broom, Professor of Animal Welfare at Cambridge University, said: 'The handling systems associated with gas stunning are generally better for pig welfare than those when electrical stunning is used.'

But he added: 'When carbon dioxide stunning is used, the welfare of the pigs is poor until they lose consciousness, usually about 30 seconds. They gasp, throw their heads around and squeal.'

The slaughter method has been previously criticised by the Farm Animal Welfare Committee (FAWC), which advises the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

One of their previous reports called for the practice to be 'phased out' out by 2008 after concluding: 'the use of high concentrations of carbon dioxide to stun and kill pigs is not acceptable.'

It added: 'FAWC supports further research into and development of alternatives to CO2, such as mixtures including argon or nitrogen, which are less aversive.'

Experiments using gases like as argon mixed with lower concentrations of carbondixodie have shown it is non-aversive to pigs, who lose consciousness without showing signs of stress.

According to Butina, the CO2 back loader system is for slaughterhouses who want to implement the latest technology and focus on animal welfare and meat quality.

Its components are thouroughly tested to prevent the pigs from becoming stressed. 

The concept for the product is based on the pigs being driven forward to the stunning system in groups in groups using a 'mechanical driveway'.

The pigs are divided into smaller groups and driven into the stunning boxes which are lowered into a CO2 atmosphere using a 'paternoster' or continuous lift system.

After stunning, the pigs are tipped out of the boxes for shackling and 'sitcking'.

The back loader can manage four to eight pigs per stunning box and between 125 and 900 pigs every hour.

But using argon is less profitable because the gas is more expensive, it can lower the quality of meat and it takes longer for the pigs to lose consciousness - so fewer pigs can be stunned every hour.

According to Professor Broom: 'The small extra cost and the extra minute during the process are easily outweighed by the better image of both the pig industry and Tesco if the best method is used.'

That message was echoed by Compassion in World Farming who is 'utterly opposed to the use of high levels of carbon dioxide stunning or killing pigs'.

It was one of seven welfare groups who wrote to the European Commission in January urging them to phase out CO2 and discuss alternative methods that will not cause the animals pain and distress.

A Tesco spokesperson said: 'We are committed to high animal welfare standards. All of our pork suppliers must be fully compliant with nationally recognised welfare assurance schemes as well as meeting additional Tesco requirements. 

'We are guided by the advice of independent bodies such as the Farm Animal Welfare Council and available scientific evidence demonstrates that CO2 stunning, combined with moving pigs in groups together, reduces stress and injury.

'We will continue to work with our pork suppliers and acknowledged veterinary experts, to explore and invest in methods that can further improve animal welfare.' 

A Co-operative Food spokesperson said: 'Animal welfare is a priority for us and we only source fresh meat and meat product from UK abattoirs which adhere to our strict sourcing requirements and high standards.'

Waitrose stated: 'Animal welfare is a top priority for us. ​Our process has been described by Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) as ensuring stress is minimised. We are confident our welfare standards are among the highest in the UK.'

ASDA said: 'Our suppliers do use carbon dioxide stunning in common with many others around the world.'

And Lidl confirmed their fresh pork suppliers 'use abattoirs that adhere to the CO2 gassing method to stun their pigs prior to slaughter'. 

'This method, which is approved according to both Freedom Food and Red Tractor animal welfare standards, is widely used in the UK and rest of Europe and commonly considered to be a more humane form of stunning than others,' its spokesperson said. 

Morrisons, who use electric stunning only, said it is 'the quickest and most effective way to minimise suffering and uphold the high level of animal welfare we operate in our abattoirs'.
