X-Factor: Paul Ryan told a national radio show host last month that he had once burned up the marathon track in less than three hours

Paul Ryan has been forced into a humiliating U-turn over claims he was an unusually fast long-distance runner.

A red-faced Ryan admitted on Saturday he didn't run a marathon in under three hours, as he boasted last month on a nationally broadcast radio interview.

The conservative congressman acknowledged he misstated his time by more than an hour.

It turns out the GOP V.P. hopeful conveniently rounded his time down - to three hours - instead of up - to four hours.

The only problem is someone was, indeed, keeping track of this track feat.

The Wisconsinite only corrected the record after Runner's World magazine unearthed evidence he had completed a single marathon in 1990, and finished in just over four hours.

That time stands in stark contrast to 
what Ryan had previously said, when he proudly bragged to radio host 
Hugh Hewitt that he had run a 'two hour and fifty-something' marathon.

That would make for a pace of less than 7 minutes per mile for the 26.2 mile course - a blazing speed for recreational runners.

Back-tracking: A red-faced Ryan admitted Saturday that had rounded his time down to about three hours instead of the mark he actually recorded, which is closer to four

'Under three, high twos. I had a two hour and fifty-something,' Ryan reportedly told Hewitt, to which the shocked radio-man expressed reportedly exclaimed, 'Holy smokes.'

'I was fast when I was younger, yeah,' Mitt Romney's running-mate quipped in reply.

The Ryan campaign told Runner’s World magazine that the House Budget Chairman ran one marathon in 1990 when he was 20 years old. That was the Grandma’s Marathon in Duluth, Minnesota. The running magazine reports he finished in 4 hours, 1 minute, and 25 seconds.

Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck provided ABC News with this statement from his boss: 'The race was more than 20 years ago, but my brother Tobin - who ran Boston last year- reminds me that he is the owner of the fastest marathon in the family and has never himself ran a sub-three.

'If I were to do any rounding, it would certainly be to four hours, not three. He gave me a good ribbing over this at dinner tonight.'

ABC News asked Buck why Ryan made it sound as if he had run more than one marathon, but Buck only responded to confirm it was just a single race.

It turns out Ryan is slower than Sarah Palin, but faster than Al Gore.

Palin reportedly has a best time of 3:59; John Edwards has run 3:30 and George W. Bush has run 3:44, while Al Gore trails the vice presidential bunch with a 4:58.

Wisconsin Congressman's time is still better than Al Gore's... but slower than Sarah Palin's
