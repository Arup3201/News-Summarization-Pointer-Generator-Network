For many British students, going to the pub is as much a part of university life as going to lectures.

But conscientious Cambridge University staff are encouraging foreign students not to indulge in that particular aspect of local culture and have prepared a £3,000 video warning of the perils of binge-drinking.

The video, commissioned by the Cambridge Colleges Senior Tutors Committee, will tell new international students that 'there might be rules and traditions, but you don't need to join in.'

It comes less than five months after photographs of Cambridge students stripping off, vomiting and urinating in flower beds prompted concerns about drinking rituals enjoyed by undergraduates.

Advice: A video, featuring this image of a man slumped on a night out, is to be shown to international students at Cambridge University, urging them not to indulge in the British binge-drinking culture

The video is presented by two students, who say: 'Being in Cambridge means you're going to be working hard and playing hard.

'But it's important to remember that playing hard doesn't necessarily mean drinking hard.

'Of course you're going to want to relax and let off some steam. But drinking too much can easily make a great night turn sour.'

The boozy 'rules and traditions' to which the presenters refer may include the annual Caesarian Sunday event.

More than 2,000 students descended on a public park for this year's event in May.

The student presenters offer plenty of sensible advice to the would-be students

Common sense: British students would be well advised to follow the video's suggestions

Parents with young children looked on appalled as girls downed port from condoms and acted out sexual positions with male students.

Many of the students, both male and female, could barely stand by the end of the afternoon.

The four-minute video for international students, which has also been posted on YouTube, includes contributions from police, NHS staff, and city clubs and pubs.

Dr Adrian Boyle, of Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, says: 'It's a big problem for us. About 40 per cent of the people we see arriving after midnight at this hospital are attending because of alcohol bingeing.'

Dr Boyle continues: 'We get people turning up not sure whether they had sexual intercourse last night because they were drunk.

'We saw somebody who fell over about three weeks before finals. They broke their wrist, they broke their right hand, they couldn't write.'

In addition to raising concerns about drinking, the video also warns foreign students that wearing their college gowns out could make them an 'easy target'.

The presenters say: 'Ditch the gown and the tux before you head out on the town.

'That way you won't stand out as such an easy target later in the night.

'And if you're still feeling threatened, head to any porter's lodge.'

Keith Willox, domus bursar at Sidney Sussex College, said: 'The YouTube link makes it easy to get the message to new students before Freshers' week and they are far more likely to listen to this advice from fellow students rather than the college authorities.'
