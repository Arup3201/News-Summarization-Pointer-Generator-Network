Only 18 months ago, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund faced each other in the Champions League Final. On Saturday, they clash again – but in very different circumstances.

Bayern have lost none of their superpower aura since winning the treble in 2013. On the contrary, under Pep Guardiola, they are developing into an even more formidable force. One humiliation at the hands of Real Madrid aside, Bayern undoubtedly remain one of the dominant forces in European football.

In Dortmund, nothing could be further from the truth. Jurgen Klopp's team languish in 15th place in the Bundesliga, with only seven points from their first nine games. More significantly, Dortmund's defence is in tatters: shapeless, error prone and lacking in confidence. At the moment, Klopp's side panic whenever they endure a set back. The fear of defeat appears to weigh over them.

Things have not been helped by the fact that the likes of Marco Reus, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Ilkay Gundogan have only just returned from injury, but the problems are as much psychological as anything. As Jurgen Klopp put it two weeks ago: 'we need to be more clinical in front of their goal, and have more concentration in front of ours'.

Those two factors remain the two most important ones. Dortmund are pressing well as usual, and with Reus back in the side, are now playing with a renewed pace. Yet they still lack coherence at the back, perhaps due to the long term injuries to Neven Subotic, Lukasz Piszczek and Mats Hummels last season. The defence is a familiar one, but it lacks playing time together, and the communication still needs work. 

Up front, new strikers Ciro Immobile and Adrian Ramos have shown promise, but they are struggling to fill the gap left by Robert Lewandowski. Once again, communication is an issue, and many have questioned whether Immobile in particular fits the Klopp system. As a classical, penalty box striker, it is unclear how well he can keep up with the fluidity of Dortmund's attacks.

Dortmund wore their Champions League kit to break their Bundesliga 'hoodoo' but still lost 1-0 to Hannover 

Their woes have been eased somewhat by a fine run of form in the Champions League and a solid 3-0 defeat of St. Pauli in the German Cup this week. But as local paper WAZ put it, 'Dortmund still need to improve'.

They have tried almost everything. The players even decided to wear their special Champions League shirts in last weekend's game against Hannover, in a superstitious bid to produce a win. It didn't work. Dortmund lost 1-0 at home despite dominating the game, and their miserable league run continued.

Bayern, on the other hand, are scoring goals for fun. They have scored 20 goals in their last four games, and one of those was a 0-0 draw. Arjen Robben is set to return from injury against Dortmund, while Franck Ribery made his first start for Bayern this season against Hamburg in midweek.

The Reds, though, remain cautious in the build up to the Dortmund game. Pep Guardiola is famously a huge admirer of Dortmund's pacy, counter attacking football, while various figures in Munich have warned against complacency.

'This Dortmund team is always going to be dangerous,' said Thomas Muller this week, 'we're not going to be 5-0 up at half time. We have to be ruthless. Both teams know each other well, and we've had a lot of tight games in recent times.'

Jurgen Klopp has already opined this season that his system tends to work better against more open, attacking teams. With a bit more space, Dortmund can utilise their counter attacks more effectively, as they did when they beat Bayern 2-0 in the German Supercup two months ago.

That might go some way to explaining their differing form in the Champions League and the Bundesliga. Domestically, they have been overcome almost exclusively by inferior teams who set up to defend, while in Europe they have come up against better, more attacking sides such as Arsenal.

Despite now being at opposite ends of the table, the rivalry between the two clubs remains as strong as ever – largely as a result of off field issues. Having already snapped up Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski from their rivals, Bayern are now flirting with the idea of poaching Marco Reus. Though no official move has yet been made for the player, Dortmund have been infuriated by repeated statements of interest from the Bayern board.

A victory against their fierce rivals on Saturday could turn Dortmund's season around, particularly if they follow it up with a win against second place Borussia Monchengladbach the following week. Another two defeats, however, and Klopp's side could find themselves in the relegation zone.
