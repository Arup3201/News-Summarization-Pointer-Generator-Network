An exceedingly opulent seaside resort in Southern California has sold for a record-breaking $360million (£240million).

The price tag for the the Montage Laguna Beach in California was so high that it works out at $1.4million (£930million) per room. 

In fact, only the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai in Hawaii and the Waldorf Astoria in New York sold for more per room in the US.

A luxurious seaside resort in Southern California - the Montage Laguna Beach - has just sold for a shattering $360 million (£240 million)

The opulent property caters more to the health and wellness crowd, with its spa facilities and pool sitting atop 50-foot bluffs

The impressive sunburst pool overlooks the stunning crystal clear ocean waters and are surrounded by plenty of luxury sunloungers

Hotel consultant Alan Reay of Atlas Hospitality told the LA Times the hotel 'shattered the price barrier for California hotels by a wide margin' after the luxurious property was snapped up.

In California, the closest any property has come was the historic Hotel Coronado in San Diego County, which sold for more than $1million (£660,000) per room.

Chicago real estate investment trust Strategic Hotels and Resorts Inc. bought the Montage from Ohana Real Estate Investors of Redwood City, though Montage Hotels & Resorts will stay on as operator.

The craftsman-style hotel, which opened in 2003, sits on a 50-foot seaside bluff along the South Coast Highway in Laguna Beach on some of the most sought-after real estate on the West Coast.

The real estate in Laguna Beach, California, which sits along the South Coast Highway, is some of the most sought-after in the world

The lobby lounge offers sweeping, panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean from its impressive floor-to-ceiling windows along one full wall

The craftsman-style hotel opened in 2003 and boasts easy access to the beach, with 250 ocean-front guestrooms available

Each room goes for about $900 per night for guests, but when it comes to this high-profile purchase, each room actually comes to $1.4 million

The Ocean Surf King Bungalow Suite (pictured) is comprised of several rooms and a large terrace from which to enjoy evening sunsets

The Catalina Suite has a view that is not to be missed! Guests can relax on their wicker sun lounger and enjoy unobstructed ocean views

The impressive spa facilities measure over 20,000 square feet in size on the 30-acre Pacific Ocean-facing property

The spa's wet area boasts several showers, a heated pool and plenty of space for complete and total relaxation

Raymond L. 'Rip' Gellein, chairman for the new owner, calls it 'one of the best resort settings in the continental United States.'

The hotel caters more to a spa-and-yoga than a bling-and-caviar crowd, with a sunburst-bottomed pool that overlooks the ocean.

And the spa itself measures 20,000 square feet in size.

The Montage Resort and Spa has a storied history - it provided the setting for the 1954 film, The Long, Long Trailer

On site, there are also several exclusive retail outlets, such as the niche fragrance and beauty store: The Art of Living

There are bungalows and private villas, along the resort's lamp-lit walkways, to choose from - including 60 extravagant suites 

The hotel also boasts several meeting areas, as well as many acclaimed restaurants, such as eateries Studio (pictured) and The Loft

Large dinner parties can be accommodated via the long tables inside restaurant Studio, while more intimate tables overlook the sea

For those who enjoy a bit of shopping, artisan goods are on offer at the shops scattered around the resort's property

Though the Aliso Beach County Park is only a few minutes walk away, why would you want to leave such a stunning resort?

Rooms go for $900 a night with bungalows and private villas along the lamp-lit walkways running even higher.

There are 250 ocean-facing guestrooms on the 30-acre property, including 60 suites. 

The property was formerly home to a very different entity: The Treasure Island Trailer Park, where Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz shot the movie The Long, Long Trailer in 1954.
