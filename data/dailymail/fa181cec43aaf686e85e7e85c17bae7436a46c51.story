Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis, 42, (pictured) said he was subjected to a 'commuter rage' incident

Consumer champion Martin Lewis has revealed how he was the victim of ‘commuter rage’ on his way to work.

The 42-year-old Money Saving Expert managed to incur the wrath of another man by texting on his mobile phone as he walked in the street. 

Multi-millionaire Lewis claims he was grabbed around the neck, shoved and verbally abused in an attack that left him ‘shaking with anger’. 

He says that the dispute began yesterday morning as he walked towards Waterloo station.

Minutes after the incident, the TV presenter told his 211,000 Facebook followers how he was pushed to one side by a professionally dressed man in his 50s.

Lewis wrote: 'While walking to Waterloo station entrance, to get the train for filming a man, and checking my phone - a 50ish, grey haired, heavy set, white man, professionally dressed, carrying a bag, shoved me aside.

'I said (not shouted) quite simply - "the word is excuse me".

'He turned around gripped me at the neck by my coat shoved me hard and said getting in my face "don't text while you walk you t***, on your f****** phone you t***, you should get out of the f****** way'.

'I replied "you've just assaulted me." To which he said "no I haven't I just called you a t***".

'I then said again very deliberately without aggression or swearing back "can you let me take a photo of you please so I can report you to the police".

'He then hurried off round the corner down the steps to the tube - sadly before I could photograph him.

'Not pleasant at all. While I wasn't physically scared, I must admit to now be shaking with anger now that he got away with that type of behaviour.

'It's a very sad state of affairs people think this is acceptable behaviour.'

Lewis concluded: ‘While I wasn’t physically scared, I must admit to now be shaking with anger that he got away with that. It’s a very sad state of affairs people think this is acceptable behaviour.’

However, his retelling of the incident sparked a debate over the rapidly growing numbers who text in the street.

While condemning the assault, many said they too found the practice irritating.

One wrote on Facebook: ‘Although the way he [the attacker] reacted is totally out of order I can understand how annoyed he was, nothing worse than trying to get somewhere and getting stuck behind someone texting.

'Every time I try to pass texters they seem to have a sixth sense and wobble the way I am trying to go… You should be a little more considerate yourself… Still no reason to ruff [sic] you up though.’

Mike Fisher, director of the British Association of Anger Management, said: ‘Living in big cities like London is becoming more and more stressful and we all might get annoyed by people talking loudly on the phone, or being distracted while texting, but this should not be a reason to lash out.

'This should be a warning to that person to sort themselves out. This won’t be the first time they’ve experienced these feelings.’

The consumer expert said the dispute began as he walked towards Waterloo station while on his phone

Last night a spokesman for Lewis, who had been on his way to film his ITV programme The Martin Lewis Money Show, said he had not yet reported the incident to police.

British Transport Police said: ‘We would encourage anyone who has been the victim of this sort of crime to come forward. We would always investigate an incident such as this.’ 

The spokesperson added that much of the area they are responsible for is covered by high quality CCTV cameras, so it is important that people report incidents quickly so the footage can be secured.
