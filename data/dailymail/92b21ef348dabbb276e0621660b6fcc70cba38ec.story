As far as foreign investors in English football go, Valeri Belokon - a garish tangerine suit aside - is one of the more inconspicuous. But the Blackpool president, widely credited with funding the club’s startling rise to the Premier League, has had enough.

In his most revealing interview since buying a 20 per cent stake in the Seasiders eight years ago, Belokon does not hold back in tearing into the running of the crisis club.

The Latvian millionaire takes aim at the controlling family, the Oystons, whose stubbornness with new manager Jose Riga saw just eight players contracted to the club three weeks before the Championship season. He implores them to pay back the parachute payments they have taken out of the club and claims ‘some people lose their mind when they’ve got so much’.

Belokon claims Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston doesn't care what division the club play in

Blackpool’s recent history is entrenched in bitterness and disappointment at the missed opportunities after striking it rich by winning promotion four years ago.

Belokon - speaking in Russian so as to not mix his words - backed supporters protesting against the ownership at Bloomfield Road. Talking at his Baltic International Bank headquarters in Riga, with a Havana cigar nestled between index and middle fingers, he left little unturned.

Belokon, 54, announced he has opened legal proceedings against owner Owen Oyston and his son, chairman Karl, over unpaid loans and could lodge a bid to buy the club. He has sounded out a wealthy local investor who wants to partner him if, crucially, the Oystons included the stadium and properties in any deal.

‘I wouldn’t be able to do it alone but I’m ready to be a partner. They need to be local. I have to be able to believe in them now I’ve had this experience with the Oyston family,’ he said. ‘Given Karl’s addictiveness to money, it won’t be easy in the short term.

‘It would be fair if they told the fans “we love money more than the club and help us sell”. Karl doesn’t care what league Blackpool play in.’

He added: ‘Soon it will be a point of no return. We asked our lawyers to start requesting a breakdown of the financial information not shown in the accounts over the last five years we are entitled to. It’s a letter before action. They have basically ignored us before now.

‘I thought I was investing in a club and I feel as if I’ve invested in the Oyston family. We voted against the £11million salary from the parachute money and some other payments. They paid no attention. The only reason Owen would have a salary was for bringing me to the club.’ He laughed but there is more than a tinge of resentment. ‘I’m not angry... I pity. The optimist in me says we can still work but I’m very sceptical now. There are emotions, ambitions and Blackpool has to come first.’

Karl Oyston had argued in 2012: ‘The £11m was paid out as part of sound tax planning - we’re UK-based and believe in paying our taxes but still have to plan sensibly. But, frankly, after the way he has supported the club all these years, if it was an £11m salary to my father, so what?’

Belokon, who asserts he is owed around £9m in direct loans, has not been to Lancashire since March 2013 ‘because they don’t listen’ and has spent a minimal amount on the club over the last four years. ‘They shouldn’t have needed my money.’

The partnership began fruitfully. Then manager Simon Grayson was backed in order to keep the team in League One and won promotion the following year. The foreign money man set up a modest ‘player fund’ to alleviate problems the Oystons were enduring when bringing in new faces. Belokon claims Ian Holloway was ready to resign two months into the job after initially being told he couldn’t sign Rangers’ Charlie Adam for £500,000.

Adam was purchased through the fund and became a major factor in their promotion. ‘It’s likely we wouldn’t have reached the top without this trust fund,’ said Belokon. ‘We agreed I would take 70 per cent of sales from players bought through the fund but I changed. I took 30 per cent and gave the club the rest from the sale of Adam.’

He alleges the club asked him to plough more money in to fund players after Adam left for Liverpool: ‘Maybe it was a joke... But I think Karl thinks I’m stupid. If you love something you’re stupid.’

Belokon smiles and applauds following Blackpool's 3-2 play-off final victory against Cardiff  at Wembley

It was a swelteringly hot day at Wembley against Cardiff in the Championship play-off final when Belokon overtly showed what an exuberant character he can be. The tangerine suit. ‘I made a promise to wear the suit. We had 10 days after the semi-final and the tailors all said no. I had it made quickly by those in the theatre here in Riga.’

Fans still buy into that ebullience but the Oystons less so. In an open letter posted on the club’s website in July, Karl slammed Belokon for asking for £24m.

The latter said that figure is ‘out of context’ - that he never asked for that to be taken from club funds - and said the suggestion he was involved in money laundering in Kyrgyzstan was ‘nonsense’. The case was thrown out on Friday by an arbitration tribunal, and the Kyrgyz government was ordered to pay more than £10m for seizing his ‘Manas Bank’.

Belokon had initially flown to the Fylde Coast to flog his brand of beer in the hope they would stock it on matchdays. The joke goes he was so bad at selling that Owen enticed him to spend £1.8m on shares.

‘When I came it was a very similar situation to now. It’s symbolic - the first time I arrived there were fans carrying an “Oyston out” banner,’ Belokon added. ‘Owen joked that I shouldn’t pay attention. He said “out” was his last name.

‘I fell in love with Blackpool. I received different proposals to buy other English clubs but this is about heart and soul - I can make money elsewhere. I have no other club.

Belokon insists he wants to stay with Blackpool but is not prepared to invest in the Oyston family

‘Owen can reverse this situation if he wants but there is a small chance of that. We would have the strength to achieve what we did before.’

What Belokon regrets is the extra millions he poured in for no return. He was responsible for the building of the Jimmy Armfield Stand and has never seen any of the profits the new structure yielded. ‘Investment for football is good but this has all gone to their family,’ he said.

‘I want to stay with this club but don’t want to invest in the Oyston family. You can spit on the fans but if they do it to you, you might drown.’

Blackpool were unavailable for comment.
