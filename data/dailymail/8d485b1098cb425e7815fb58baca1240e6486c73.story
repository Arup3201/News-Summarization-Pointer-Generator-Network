A real-life Instagram camera is set to go on sale after being backed by Polaroid.

The camera was originally developed as a concept by designers Socialmatic.

It contains a lens, touchscreen and printer - and has been designed to look like the icon for Facebook's photo sharing site.

The product was originally designed as a concept, and uses film that has space to write, and a sticky strip on the back rather like a post-it note.

However, after the designs became a hit online, the two firms have decided to turn them into a real product.

The camera is set to go on sale next year, and will come with camera bags, lenses, filters and other camera accessories.

'We are so proud to work together with C
& A and Polaroid, giants of digital photography,' said 
Antonio De Rosa, CEO of Socialmatic.

'It â€˜s been a long and difficult 
negotiation but we were strongly motivated to reach an agreement to 
create a small revolution in digital photography.

'This mix of Hardware 
and Software, together with our brand new photo social network will fill
the gap between virtuality and reality.'

The firm says the design of the camera has not yet been finalised, but hopes it will go on sale next year.

The camera will have an LCD screen so owners can choose the filters they want for their photos

The camera will be branded with Polaroid, who previously made small instant cameras but have struggled since the advent of digital photography.
