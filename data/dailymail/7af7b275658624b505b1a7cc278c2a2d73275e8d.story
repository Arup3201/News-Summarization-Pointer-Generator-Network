A couple accused of torturing and killing a pensioner took a taxi back to the scene of the crime to steal valuables and empty his freezer, a court has heard.

Mother-of-four Kelly Louise Barnes, 32, and Jodie Barnes, formerly Ramsbottom, 31, are accused of targeting retired bus conductor Barry Reeve, believing he had large sums of cash.

Mr Reeve, 67, remained alive for up to 48 hours after being punched, stamped on and cut with a knife in an alleged attempt to force him to disclose his Pin. His body was found in his home two weeks later.

Norwich, believing he had a secret stash of money

The women, who are in a civil partnership, deny murdering him, at Norwich Crown Court.

Today taxi driver Niall Gallagher said he collected the pair shortly after 8.30pm on February 9 last year, the day of Mr Reeve's murder.

He said they claimed they had been kicked out of their home as they had fallen out with an 'alcoholic guy'.

When they arrived at the terraced bungalow in Corton Road, Norwich, first Jodie Barnes then Kelly scaled the back gate and began piling up bin bags they had carried out of the property, the court heard.

Mr Gallagher added: 'It seemed like a rush job, it was not carefully done.

'One of the bags had leaking medicine in it, another contained a large camcorder.

'There was food, some of it was frozen.'

He added he took the couple to a cash machine at Sainsbury's where they tried to withdraw money.

Prosecutor Karim Khalil QC earlier told the court that the women made failed attempts to withdraw money using Mr Reeve's card.

Mr Gallagher then drove to the Barnes' home in Bixley Close, Norwich, where they unloaded the bags and he saw food spilling from some of them.

'It wasn't normal, I didn't feel comfortable,' he said.

He contacted police to report his concerns after seeing reports that Mr Reeve's body had been discovered on February 26.

Opening the case, Mr Khalil said that the drug addict couple left Mr Reeve dying before returning to his flat.

A post-mortem examination showed he was alive for at least 15 hours and up to 48 hours after the attack, meaning he was still alive when they returned.

Mr Khalil said: 'He was brutally beaten, cut with a sharp blade and left to die in his home, unable to summon help.'

'It is a sad fact that he was not found until two weeks later when his daughter, Julie Reeve, called round'

'She found the back door unlocked, 
opened it and saw blood on the inner door. She could not bear to go in 
any further and called on a neighbour.

'Together they went back, called for him but got no answer and decided to call the emergency services.'

Kelly Louise Barnes and Jodie Barnes, both of Bixley Close, Norwich, who were in a civil partnership together, deny murder.

Accused: It is alleged that Kelly Barnes, right, and Jodie Barnes, left, beat Mr Reeve and cut him with a knife before leaving him dying

A post-mortem examination showed that Mr Reeve was alive for between 15 and 48 hours after suffering brain injuries.

Mr Khalil said the couple had injured him in 'varied and awful ways’.

He
said: 'His injuries reveal that whilst he was still alive he was beaten
savagely and that he was scored with a sharp blade to his face and 
torso in a manner akin to torture. He must have suffered dreadfully.

Mr Reeve lived off a pension and benefits but had been heard talking about having large sums of money, once claiming that he carried around £2,000 in cash.

The case continues and is expected to last up to three weeks.
