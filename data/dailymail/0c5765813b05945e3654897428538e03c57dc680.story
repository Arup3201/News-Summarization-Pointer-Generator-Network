Fifty Shades of Grey is boosting sales in book shops and sex toy stores alike.

And it seems that lingerie outlets are also reaping the rewards of the erotic novel as more women are heading out to buy new underwear.

A new study found that women own an average of thirty four pairs of knickers, that’s three times as many as in 1999, when the average was just 12.

The Grey effect: Women admit that reading the erotic novel encouraged them to buy more 'special occasion' underwear

And the figure is being boosted by the desire for more ‘special occasion undies’ - dubbed the 'Fifty Shades of Grey effect'.

The typical knicker drawer contains 20 everyday pairs and 14 for 'best', according to a poll of 2,000 women for the UK’s leading laundry specialists, Dr Beckmann (Glo White).

Most women (56%) say they have separate knicker collections for special occasions and for everyday comfort.

The revolution in sexy undies has been led by the upsurge in saucy romance novels like Fifty Shades of Grey and the increasing number of women’s-only underwear retailers.

And, of those, 61% admit it has made them more likely to purchase ‘special occasion’ underwear.

All white: 58% of women confess that big and comfortable white knickers are their favourite

Dr Beckmann spokesman Susan Fermor said: 'There have clearly been many contributory factors to the upsurge in the number of pairs of knickers owned by British women.

'Our research reveals that they own, on average, three times as many pairs now as they did in 1999.

'And many put it down to this new era of female liberation we seem to be experiencing in the UK.'

'Back in 1999 it would have been unusual for a British woman to admit she was reading a saucy romance novel but now, in 2012, they are loudly and proudly reading similar fiction on the bus, on the train and even expressing their love of books like Fifty Shades of Grey across Facebook and many other social networking sites.

'It is a true 21st Century phenomenon and it is clearly informing British women’s choices when it comes to the way they are expressing themselves, including the amount and kind of underwear they are currently buying.'

While the new era of female liberation may have ushered in many changes in 2012, the favourite colour of ladies undies, certainly among the women who wear them, remains the same.

A massive 58% of all those women polled admit that bright white knickers are by far their favourite, whether for everyday or special occasions.
