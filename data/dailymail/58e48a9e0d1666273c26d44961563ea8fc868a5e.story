An auction house is providing a rare opportunity to buy a 500-year-old piece of natural history by selling bones from a dodo bird for the first time in 80 years.

The leg and pelvis from the flightless bird, which died out in the mid-17th century, represent the first opportunity to purchase a complete part of the animal's skeleton since 1934.

The anonymous vendor is believed to be one of only three people left in the world who privately own dodo bones, with most now on display in museums.

The pair were part of a large collection of remains discovered by a British schoolmaster 220 years after the bird became extinct.

In 1886 George Clarke went to Mauritius, the only place the dodo is said to have lived, and hired slaves to wade through a swamp and feel for the bones with their feet.

The leg and pelvis, which are being sold by Summers Place Auctions of Billingshurst in West Sussex, are said to be worth more than £30,000 together and are both in excellent states of preservation.

Earlier this year, a fragment of a femur was sold for £8,000 by auction house Christie's in London.

Dodos were first spotted by Dutch sailors who arrived on the Indian Ocean isle in 1598, but the final sighting was only 64 years later in 1662.

While it is thought they were hunted to extinction by humans, another belief is that macaque monkeys plundered dodo nests after being introduced on Mauritius.

Errol Fuller, a natural history expert and curator for the auction, said: 'Most dodo bones that exist today were found in a swamp in Mauritius by George Clarke.

'The remains went to museums and private collectors but over the years they have gradually gravitated to museums.

'Only about 10 museums in the world have a complete dodo skeleton and most of them are composites.

'Physical remains of the bird in private hands today hardly exist. There are only two or three people in the world privately who have dodo bones.

'The last complete dodo bone was sold in 1934 in London. There will be a lot of interest in these two items. There are dodo fans all over the world and there are lots of them.

Around 200 years after they had died out, dodo birds started to gain a mythical status due to Victorian author Lewis Carroll.

He was inspired to write the creature into Alice's Adventures in Wonderland after seeing the head of one at a museum in Oxford.

Mr Fuller added: 'The dodo was so extreme looking yet nobody really took much notice of them until the 1860s when Lewis Carroll wrote about one in Alice in Wonderland.

'That generated an interest in the bird that has never ceased. If you go to Mauritius today you can by souvenir dodo T-shirts and ashtrays.

'And of course the dodo is regarded as a symbol of extinction, mainly due to the saying 'dead as a dodo.'
