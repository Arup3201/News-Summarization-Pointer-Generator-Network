Niki Taylor was on the cover of Vogue before most girls her age even snagged their first kiss, but her life hasn't always been runways and red carpets.

The former supermodel, now 39, opened up to Oprah in an emotional interview talking about the loss of her little sister Krissy at a young age and nearly dying herself in a 2001 car crash.

In a preview of the interview, set to air Sunday night at 9pm, Taylor says unexpectedly losing Krissy, also a model, to a rare heart condition in 1995 was 'the biggest tragedy and loss' of her life.

'We were very close. We worked together. We did everything together. I miss her very much,' Taylor says.

Taylor goes on to reveal that she started self-medicating to deal with the sudden loss of her closest friend.

'I was 21 and I didn't deal with it very good at all because I wanted to be numb,' she says. 'And I chose prescription drugs. That was my choice and not wanting to deal with losing my best friend.'

Taylor first started working as a model at the age of 13, when she was signed to an agency in her native Florida. By the age of 14, she landed her first magazine cover on the August 1989 issue of Seventeen, and just a year later she made history by becoming the youngest person ever to grace the cover of fashion-bible Vogue.

In addition to losing her sister, Taylor herself almost died in 2001 when she was involved in a serious car crash in Atlanta, Georgia while being driven by then-boyfriend Chad Renegar. 

Renegar was apparently attempting to answer his phone when he lost control of the car and crashed into a utility pole. 

'We turned onto an ordinary street,' Taylor says. 'We hit a utility pole and the seat belt tore my liver in half. If I had been sitting this way or this way or just in a different position, maybe the outcome would have been different. But for some reason I was supposed to go through that and be in the hospital for three months - be in a coma, die on the operating table twice.'

Thankfully, Taylor was wearing her seat belt at the time and was not thrown from the vehicle. 

Fighter: Taylor also speaks about the 2001 car crash in which she almost died. The crash left her in a coma for weeks, and she had to undergo some 40 surgeries 

However, she lost 80 per cent of the blood in her bodies from injuries, and was in a coma for weeks, undergoing some 40 surgeries. 

'It was definitely a miracle that I survived,' Taylor says. 

Taylor's full 'Where are they now?' interview airs tonight on OWN at 9pm.
