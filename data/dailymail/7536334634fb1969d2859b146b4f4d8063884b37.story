Most people would regard completing an ordinary marathon as an impressive physical achievement.

But only the toughest of athletes need apply for the Badwater Ultramarathon - a staggering 135-mile route in the relentless heat of Death Valley, California.

Billed as the world's toughest foot race, competitors race in temperatures of up to 55C over three mountain ranges along the lengthy route - the equivalent of completing five marathons back-to-back.

The start line is at Badwater Basin in Death Valley, 280ft below sea level and the lowest point in North America.

After pounding the asphalt for a staggering 135 miles - taking in three mountain ranges - competitors finish up at 8,350ft near Mount Whitney - adding up to a total cumulative vertical ascent of 13,000ft - all in sweltering mid-summer temperatures.

A total of 96 hardened competitors from 22 countries took part in this year's Badwater Ultramarathon

From there competitors make their way along the snaking 135-mile route over three mountain ranges in extreme desert heat to finish at Mount Whitney.

It typically takes an athlete around 24 hours to win the ultramarathon.
