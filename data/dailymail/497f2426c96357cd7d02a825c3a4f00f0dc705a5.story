Just when it seemed things could not 
get any worse for English cricket, along comes another grim day in a 
soap opera that shows no sign of ending.

The
 showpiece match of the domestic season, the Lord’s Test against India, 
begins on Thursday but that was almost forgotten yesterday as the behaviour of
 players on and off duty took centre stage.

I know what they're doing! Alastair Cook thinks India's pursuit of James Anderson is all mind games

Article 2.3.3 of ICC's Code of Conduct

'Where
 the facts of the alleged incident are not adequately or clearly covered
 by any of the above offences, conduct that either: (a) is contrary to 
the spirit of the game; or (b) brings the game into disrepute'.

Level 3 penalty

All
 Level 3 breaches carry a penalty of between four and eight Suspension 
Points. Two suspension points equates to a ban of one Test, or two ODIs,
 depending on which type of match is scheduled next for the suspended 
player.

The deep wounds inflicted by the nightmare tour of Australia and the bitter aftermath of the Kevin Pietersen affair had begun to heal. Yet no-one was considering the chances of England ending their winless run against India yesterday. All attention was focused on a senior player accused of a physical assault on an opponent, and a junior one who embarrassed himself in a Nottingham nightclub four days before one of the biggest games of his career.

Pictures of a drunk Gary Ballance will do little to improve the image of a national side looking to win back the affections of a disillusioned  public, even if England insist he had been given a night off and there was no impropriety.

More worrying was the prospect of their best bowler being suspended at a time when they desperately need a victory, any victory, to end the  gloom created by the worst tour in England’s history and a run of nine Tests without a win.

Physical contact is the great taboo of cricket, the ‘crime’ that players are forbidden to commit on the field, however heated the verbal exchanges. And it is the extent of the contact between Jimmy Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja in the narrow staircase in the Trent Bridge pavilion at lunch on the second day of the first Test that lies at the heart of an escalating and nasty dispute.

Make no mistake, this is serious. Level Three charges are rare in international cricket and the game has not seen one for six years, since India’s Harbhajan Singh was accused of making a racist comment to Australia’s Andrew Symonds.

No England player has faced an accusation
 as serious as this under the International Cricket Council’s code of 
conduct. Anderson, who faces a four-match ban, is said to be  bemused 
and hurt by the accusation.

Yet it is a charge that India, and 
specifically their captain MS Dhoni, are insisting on which has led to a
 near breakdown in relations between the teams.

It is what happened 
in those moments when Anderson clashed with Jadeja and Dhoni as both 
teams entered the famous old pavilion and prepared to turn right, at the
 bottleneck where one staircase leads to both dressing rooms, that will 
determine the extent of Anderson’s punishment.

Dhoni has driven this 
charge, despite the efforts of the ICC and senior officials from both 
nations to broker peace, and as the most powerful man in Indian and 
world cricket, what Dhoni says goes.

England’s retaliation was 
confirmed last night when a Level Two charge was brought on Jadeja — 
England don’t want to fall into the trap of backing long bans for both 
players — with the India spinner accused of ‘turning suddenly and taking
 steps towards Anderson in an aggressive and threatening manner’. It 
was  certainly more sudden turn than Jadeja managed with his innocuous 
spin bowling at Trent Bridge.

So what happened? England insist Jadeja
 was the aggressor as the players, in single file, prepared to climb the
 rickety Trent Bridge staircase, moving aggressively towards Anderson 
after a verbal on-field clash.

India view things differently and 
consider Anderson guilty of breaking that taboo by ‘pushing and abusing’
 Jadeja. Or are they, as Alastair Cook suggested, playing a tactical 
game to rid this series of England’s most important bowler?

Nobody 
doubts physical contact took place. It is what Anderson (below) did to 
get Jadeja ‘out of his space’ that will determine, initially in a 
preliminary hearing on Tuesday,  the extent of any punishment.

Both 
sides claim to have witnesses and Sportsmail understands that several 
stewards will give evidence for England. It is their word and that of 
India’s witnesses, who include reserves Ishwar Pandey and Pankaj Singh, 
that the ICC’s judicial commissioner must consider. Most players have 
taken the ‘Arsene Wenger’ approach, as Cook put it, and claim to have 
seen nothing. India were quick to act, making a complaint to the ICC the
 very next day. An ICC lawyer then flew to England and spoke to both 
sides in a vain attempt to resolve the matter.

ECB chairman Giles Clarke could do nothing to dissuade Dhoni from his confrontational path. Yet
 it must be pertinent that the clash happened out of the public eye. If 
the players had come together on the field there could be no doubt what 
happened. But the wider public must wonder why it could not have been 
resolved in private.

Peter Moores must wonder what on earth he has 
taken on returning as England coach. He was last night reminding 
Ballance and other  England players who went out on Sunday night, 
including Anderson, of their responsibilities.

But it is the prospect of losing Anderson that will concern him most and which will lead to a tense atmosphere at Lord’s.

The stakes are high now both on and off the most famous cricket field in the world.

ROOT ROCKED (June 2013)

The
 angelic looking Joe Root winds up Australia opener David Warner so much
 in the VIP area of the Walkabout bar in Birmingham that the loudmouth 
Aussie punches the young Tyke.

BROAD WALK (July)

The
 mother of all rows erupts when Stuart Broad edges an Ashton Agar 
delivery to Aussie captain Michael Clarke at first slip. Incredibly, 
umpire Aleem Dar fails to spot the huge nick, Broad stands his ground...
 and there follows all manner of hypocritical spoutings from Aussies 
over not walking.

TROTT TORMENT (Nov)

Bully
 boy Warner is at it again, this time with the verbals, saying Jonathan 
Trott is ‘poor, weak and looked scared’ facing Mitchell Johnson. Trott 
was already on his way home, suffering from a ‘stress-related 
condition’.

MANKAD MESS (June 2014)

Controversy
 at Edgbaston as  Sri Lanka spinner Sachithra Senanayake — who himself 
was later suspended over a suspect action — runs out England 
wicketkeeper Jos Buttler for backing up too far, a dismissal known as a 
Mankad. The bad blood spills over into the Test series.
