Accused: Ross Ulbricht is accused of masterminding the Silk Road website and plotting six murders

The man allegedly behind Silk Road, a black market website where users could trade guns and drugs, is now also accused of hiring a hitman to kill six people.

Ross William Ulbricht, 29, was arrested on October 1 in San Francisco, accused of being behind the so-called hidden site, which has gained widespread notoriety for its illicit trading over the past two years.

Following his arrest, the FBI shut down the site and Ulbricht was charged with a number of crimes, including plotting the murders of two people.

But last week, Ulbricht, who was denied bail over fears he could abscond, was accused by prosecutors of actually plotting to kill six people.

Prosecutors say Ulbricht, who operated under the alias, Dread Pirate Roberts, hired someone named 'redandwhite' to carry out the killings.

However, the government was not able to confirm any of the six murders actually took place.

Prosecutors suggest that Ulbricht may have therefore been duped into paying the fee of $500,000 Bitcoins to his hitman.

A so-called hidden site, Silk Road used an online tool known as Tor to mask the location of its servers.

Visitors could buy and 
sell drugs and guns using bitcoins, a form of online cash.

While
many other sites sell drugs more or less openly, Silk Road's technical 
sophistication, its user-friendly escrow system and promise of 
near-total anonymity quickly made it among the best known.

The popularity of Silk Road is said to have earned the site owner $80 million from commissions involving every sale.

The
FBI shut down the site after Ulbricht's arrest on October 1 at a small
branch library in San Francisco as he chatted online with a cooperating
witness, according to authorities and court papers.

Among the allegations against him is one from the Baltimore 
federal court involving soliciting the murder of a former worker who was 
arrested on drug charges.

The indictment alleges Ulbricht feared the 
former worker would turn on him.

Meanwhile prosecutors
in New York have charged Ulbricht - a native Texan who was living in 
San Francisco and holds degrees from the University of Texas and Penn 
State - with trying unsuccessfully to solicit the murder of a Canadian 
man who allegedly hacked into Silk Road, obtained dealers names and 
began blackmailing Ulbricht.

Ulbricht
is also accused of operating Silk Road under the alias 'Dread Pirate 
Roberts' and earning $80 million from commissions involving every sale.

FBI
agents appear to have penetrated the behind-the-scenes operations of 
Silk Road and obtained a list of the sites users and sellers, court 
papers show.

Authorities
in Britain, Sweden, and the United States have arrested eight people 
who are charged with using the site to sell drugs.

Earlier this month, it was also revealed that just six weeks after being shut down, the website had reopened.Silk Road 2.0 - which can only be accessed through a modified internet browser - sells items such as cocaine, ecstasy, fake utility bills and driving licences.

But some commentators have expressed caution over Silk Road 2.0, with one suggesting it could be a scam by law enforcement agencies, set up to capture details about those using the website.

Ulbricht's family and friends protest that he is innocent and this week offered $1m in bail for his release.

Business: Ulbricht is listed as an entrepreneur on LinkedIn. He is accused of operating Silk Road under the alias 'Dread Pirate Roberts' and earning $80 million from commissions involving every sale
