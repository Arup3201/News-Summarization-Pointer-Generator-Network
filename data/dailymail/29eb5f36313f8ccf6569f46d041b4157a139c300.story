A swimming official who had a sexual relationship with a promising young swimmer gave her a diamond ring and a sex toy, a Brisbane court has heard.

The 57-year-old introduced himself to the girl's parents in 2010 as 'a man of means in terms of obtaining sponsorship' after watching her compete as a 14-year-old, the Brisbane District Court heard on Monday.

With her parents' permission, he travelled with the girl to various international competitions throughout 2011 and by 2012 their relationship had become sexual with frequent contact over Facebook, text messages and Skype calls.

'Even (her) parents noticed the increased interest of the defendant in their daughter,' Crown Prosecutor Phil McCarthy told the court on the first day of the trial.

'They will tell you they dismissed it as simply attentive interest in their exceptional child.'

During a trip to New Zealand in late 2012, the man presented the swimmer with a purple vibrator, which he subsequently used on her, the court heard.

The pair drank together in their hotel and the defendant was 'continually topping up her drink' before she eventually lost her virginity to him, Mr McCarthy said.

The relationship soured in January 2013 when, also during a trip to New Zealand, the man entered her hotel room, pushed a couch against the door, tied her to the bed and assaulted her repeatedly.

'The event upset (her) greatly and she cried. (They) fought after the incident and she went to the balcony intent on ending her own life,' Mr McCarthy said.

The girl's parents became aware of the relationship after intercepting a Facebook conversation in which she had confided in an older friend, the court heard.

The defendant pleaded not guilty to eight counts of engaging in sexual intercourse with a young person outside Australia when in a position of trust or authority, and four counts of engaging in sexual activity other than intercourse.

The man's defence team has submitted admissions including that he was aware of the girl's age at the time of their relationship.

'The critical issue anticipated in this trial is that the crown proving that (he) was indeed in a position of authority or trust at the time of the particular offending,' Mr McCarthy said.

The man, who organised accommodation and travel for swimming teams, faces a five-day trial before Judge Brad Farr.
