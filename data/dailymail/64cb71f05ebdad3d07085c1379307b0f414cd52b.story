A watch given by Elvis Presley to a friend while on military duty in the late 1950s has sold for over $50,000 at auction.

Elvis gave the Omega Constellation to army buddy Charlie Hodge and it was snapped up by a collector for more than 
five times its estimate. It would have been worth just less than $1,500 had it not be worn on the wrist of The King.

It is thought the singer bought the 
timepiece for himself and it is known that he had it when he was 
stationed in Germany with his friend Charlie who died recently.

The watch sold at Antiquorum auctions in New York and went for a total of $52,922.80.

Presley loved his watches and it is a rare to see a photograph showing his wrist when he is not wearing one.

He was presented with an $800 
diamond-studded by casino boss Frank Williams in the late 1950s after he
played Las Vegas for the first time.

He was said to be so pleased with the gift that he bombarded Williams with letters of thanks.

Later this month a selection of Elvis memorabilia, including the starr's original crypt will go under the hammer as part of ‘Music Icons’ auction in Beverley Hills.

The tomb is located inside the granite and marble mausoleum at the Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

Presley was interred there alongside his mother, Gladys, after he died August 16, 1977.

Given his immense popularity, his funeral turned into a bit of a circus, and one of the cars leaving his famed Graceland mansion after the August 18 funeral killed to spectators outside the gates.

Nearly 80,000 people lined the processional route which ended at the Forest Hills Cemetery, and it continued to serve as a makeshift memorial for the following weeks.

Two months later, they were re-buried at his Graceland home after a failed attempt to steal the singer’s body from the crypt.

Though 
it may not be the same as the shoes that inspired a song, one of the 
singer’s blue suede jackets is for sale as are a pair of his sunglasses,
both expected to bring in between $4,000 and $6,000 a piece.
