Now let’s see... you’re running the country while the PM is away and keen to get some good publicity after taking a recent hammering.

So why not ditch the official Jaguar and meet the people on the commute into work? Better not to join the hordes on the sweaty Tube, the river bus is much nicer on a lovely summer morning, even if it is more expensive.

And, gosh, how lucky, a photographer just happens to be there to record your ‘impromptu’ trip as you swig coffee, chat to fellow commuters and exchange loving glances with your wife...

All smiles: Nick Clegg and wife Miriam Durantez Gonzalez gaze at each other during a half hour boat trip to work this morning

Lonely at the top: With David Cameron still on holiday in Portugal, Mr Clegg is the most senior government minister in Westminster

At least in his open-neck shirt and expensive suit, Nick Clegg looked more at ease than David Cameron did on Friday as he attempted the casual look on holiday in Portugal with wife Samantha.

The Deputy Prime Minister and his wife Miriam, a lawyer, were returning to work yesterday after their own break in Spain.

It was the first time Mr Clegg has used the river bus for the half-hour commute from his home in Putney, South-West London, to his Westminster office.

But his ministerial car still had to make the trip, to carry paperwork for the Liberal Democrat leader, who, Downing Street insists, is not running things as Mr Cameron ‘remains in charge’ – even on holiday.

On Wednesday Mr Clegg is expected to host the second of his new monthly press conferences, taking questions from journalists on any topic.

By contrast Mr Cameron has faced criticism for not holding the 'take all-comers' press conferences which became routine under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

Stepping out: The Cleggs were seen walking in the sunshine this morning while other commuters braved traffic jams and over-heated public transport

Rested: The couple have just returned from a week in Spain, where Miriam's family are from

As millions of people battled through 
traffic jams or the crush on trains and buses, Mr Clegg looked relaxed 
as he boarded the boat from his family home in Putney to Westminster.

During the half hour river journey the Cleggs enjoyed coffee from Costa – notably snubbing Starbucks which has faced criticism for its low tax bill in Britain.

Downing Street has repeatedly stressed that Mr Cameron 'remains in charge' wherever he is in the world.

But Mr Clegg has encouraged the idea that senior ministers 'hold the fort' when the PM is taking a break.

The two men faced criticism after it emerged they would both be out of the country at the same time.
