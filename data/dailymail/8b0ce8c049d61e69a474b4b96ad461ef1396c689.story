Disney's Frozen became the top grossing animated film earlier this year, with its story of two sisters winning the hearts of every little girl who saw it.

And so for its next venture Disney is demonstrating that it is best to stick with what you know as their new CG animation will too, feature a female protagonist.

Moana will be set in the South Pacific and explore the journey of a teenage girl who explores the oceans in search of a legendary island in the fantasy land of Oceania.

Disney have released the first artwork image of their new film Moana, set to be released in late 2016

During the course of her journey Moana is joined by a demigod, Maui, who helps her in her search of the lost island. 

Many details of the film are still being kept top secret however the animation company have released the first image of the artwork for the story, which sees two characters aboard a boat.

Set to be released in late-2016 it will be directed by Ron Clements and John Musker who also co-produced The Little Mermaid and The Princess and the Frog.

The directors behind the new film also produced The Princess and the Frog, which reported disappointing box office sales

The choice in direction may come as a slight surprise after The Princess and the Frog was dubbed a 'flop' after disappointing figures at the box office with Disney fearing that the word 'Princess' in the title scared off boys.

The film giants have since adapted the titles of their female-lead films accordingly with following titles including Tangled (replacing the female orientated Rapunzel) Brave (dubbed Disney' first feminist) and Frozen. 

In their recent female-lead films, Disney has avoided using 'Princess' in its film titles to prevent alienating a male audience

Despite previous struggles Ron Clements says he was excited to work with John Musker once again and says it has been one of the pair's highlights. 

In a statement Ron said: 'John and I have partnered on so many films. Creating Moana is one of the great thrills of our career. It's a big adventure set in this beautiful world of Oceania.'

John added that Moana is a character he hopes will capture the audience's hearts. 

'Moana is indomitable, passionate and a dreamer with a unique connection to the ocean itself. She's the kind of character we all root for, and we can't wait to introduce her to audiences.'
