Lillo Brancato, an actor who once starred in The Sopranos, has landed his first acting role since leaving prison - in a music video.

Brancato, 37, is set to star in pop singer Natali Yura's latest music video for her song Fall For You, directed by the son of the producer of Scarface.

Brancato was sentenced to 10 years for his role in a botched robbery that led to the shooting death of an off-duty NYPD police officer.

Brancato was released on New Years Eve after serving eight years in prison.

The
 music video is produced by New York nightclub owner Noel Ashman, who 
had promised to give Brancato a job once he was out of prison, the New 
York Post's Page Six reported.

Coincidentally,
 the music video will be directed by Michael Bregman, who is the son of 
the producer of classic mob drama Scarface.

'I
 really do love acting, and for any opportunity, for anyone to take a 
chance on me so quickly, it’s humbling and I’m just so grateful,' Brancato told the Post last month.

Brancato must stay with his family in New York's Yonkers for at least six months under the conditions of his parole.

After that, he said, he'd like to move to the West Coast and try and resurrect his once-promising acting career.

Brancato rose to fame in the 1993 
movie A Bronx Tale, playing a young kid from the neighborhood who is 
torn between two worlds and two men: a local mobster played by Chazz 
Palmintieri and his straight-and-narrow bus-driver father, played by 
Robert DeNiro.

Other 
roles followed, most notably a stint on the second season of The 
Sopranos. His character carried out a series of low-level crimes for the
 New Jersey mob before being gunned down by Tony Soprano and his 
sidekick as he tearfully begged for his life.

Brancato told the New York Daily News that he hopes to get back in touch with DeNiro and Pamintieri.

'These are the guys who gave me my first shot,' he said. 'I’d muse they’re definitely disappointed in what happened, and I just want to let them know I’m sorry for that.

'I want to show them I’m no longer that person, and I used my time in prison wisely.'

Brancato was charged with 
second-degree murder - but was only convicted of burglary in 2008 and 
was sentenced to serve 10 years and five-years probation in 2009.

According to prosecutors, Brancato and a man named Steven Armento broke into a house in the Bronx belonging to a friend, in order to steal prescription drugs after a night of drinking at a 
strip club.

Officer Daniel Enchautegui heard the commotion next door from his home and went to investigate.

Armento
 shot the 28-year-old officer with the .357 Magnum he was carrying in 
the heart and the dying officer fired back shooting both men.

Armento was sentenced to life in prison without parole after being found guilty of first-degree murder.

In a statement upon his release,  New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Assocation President Patrick J. Lynch said he believed Brancato was guilty in the officer’s death.

'It
 is our firm belief that Lillo Brancato is guilty of the murder of 
police officer Daniel Enchautequi even though he was only convicted of 
attempted burglary.

'Even
 while incarcerated, this lowlife thug showed his true colors when he 
beat up a fellow inmate who wouldn’t get off a pay phone quickly 
enough,' Lynch said in the statement.

Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association trustee Joe Anthony said he was outraged by the decision by the parole board.

'I sat in the courtroom everyday with the family while that smug punk smiled and laughed at them,' he said.

'I hope someone taught him respect in prison.'

Brancato,
 who was allowed to maintain a Twitter account while serving his 
sentence, posted a message of thanks online to all his supporters.

'With
 that being said, this will be my last tweet from prison. Thank you for 
your love and support. I love you all!' he tweeted to his 3,364 
followers.

Brancato testified during the 2008 trial there was a never a break-in.

He claimed that he had known the owner, a Vietnam veteran, for several years. He also said he had permission to go inside and take painkillers and other pills whenever he felt like it, and didn't know the man had died earlier that year.

The pills were part of a drug problem that he said began when he was 'introduced to marijuana' on the set of A Bronx Tale. He later became hooked on crack and heroin, he said.

He told the jury that while suffering from judgment-impairing heroin withdrawals on the night of the shooting, he accidentally broke the kitchen window of the apartment in a desperate attempt to wake up his old pill-supplier.

'I was becoming dope sick,' Brancato testified. 'Mentally, I was a mess.'

Brancato tried to deflect suggestions by the prosecution that his testimony - at times punctuated by vignettes about his drug-crazed downfall - was another acting job.

Warm welcome: Not everyone is as pleased as Lillo Brancato's family that he has been released from prison early, including Rosa Enchautegui, sister of the officer shot dead during the 2005 robbery

Brancato says his drug problem was so severe his own family nearly disowned him, and that he was still using at Rikers.

‘I had all these people supporting me, and they finally had had it,' he told the New York Post. 'They told me if I kept going like I was going, they wouldn’t be there. It really woke me up.'

He says he has been clean since November 18, 2006.

While behind bars, he got a degree in business management and administration.
