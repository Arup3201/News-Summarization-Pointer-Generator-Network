A bride who broke a leg on her hen do and was wheeled down the aisle in a wheelchair and woolly slippers has finally had her first dance - one year after her wedding.

Amanda French, 51, was injured after falling over while rollerskating during her boozy bash two weeks before tying the knot.

The bride, from Chorley, Lancashire, had to be wheeled down the aisle and was unable to have her first dance with new husband Paul.

But a year later she is back on her feet and danced with her husband on Sunday as they celebrated their first wedding anniversary.

Amanda, nee Cooke, broke two bones in her leg just twelve minutes into a 1970s-themed hen party at a roller rink.

She said: 'When I went down everyone was saying I had just got a bump, but I thought it was quite serious. I had to get an ambulance.'

Amanda didn't let the wheels and slippers her her spirits down on the big day

'I told the hen party to carry on and I thought I would meet them later for a meal and go for karaoke and to the pubs,' she says.

'I didn’t want anyone to tell my then husband-to-be so I waited until the last minute. When they said I was having an operation, I knew I wouldn’t make the meal.'

Paul, 59, was having his stag party at the same time and Amanda said he ‘wasn’t surprised' when he found out what had happened.

It was the second time she had broken a bone roller skating, after breaking her arm at the age of 14.

Amanda had a metal pin put in her leg but the couple did not consider cancelling their wedding but it did mean a change of plan to Amanda's footwear. Her wedding heels had to be ditched in favour of a pair of knitted slippers.

Amanda said: 'I had been for a practice at the venue and walked down the aisle in step to the song I had chosen.

'But I had to be wheeled down the aisle instead. It was different. I didn’t plan on being in a wheelchair, obviously, but it added a bit of humour to the day.

'Everyone rallied round and it was still fantastic. It didn’t spoil it at all.'

Amanda spent a couple of weeks in the wheelchair and then months on crutches. The happy couple, who have four children between them, had to postpone their honeymoon, but finally made it to Rome in May.
