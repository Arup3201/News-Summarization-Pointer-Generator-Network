A Los Angeles comedian who baked iPhone cookies in order to
fool cops into pulling him over got his wish, but he also got taken downtown.

Randy Liedtke took his joke on the road Wednesday,
driving around and tweeting about it until a cop finally pulled him over.

Then his joke took an unexpected turn as the angry officer
took him in because of a warrant he had for unpaid parking tickets.

Half-baked: Randy Liedtke thought it would be funny to bake iPhone shaped cookes and try to get pulled over for talking on one while driving in Los Angeles

‘Wasn't worth it. I'm an idiot,’ he tweeted Wednesday night.
‘No more iPhone Cookies.’

The tweet was accompanied by a photo of the bearded,
red-haired jokester holding up a ticket and looking very sorry for what he did.

But he only had himself to blame.

‘Baked some iPhone cookies to trick cops into pulling me
over,’ he wrote on Tumblr before his ill-fated outing. ‘Then I just take a bite
and ask if cookies are against the law.’

Seemed funny at the time: Liedtke live tweeted his sugary experiment, even when it took a very unexpected turn

How could anything have gone wrong?

Liedtke live tweeted his sugary experiment from start to
finish.

‘Just saw a police car going the other way. Gonna turn
around and see if I can catch up and drive by it. #iphonecookie,’ he wrote.

Oops: The angry cop got the last laugh when he discovered the comedian had a warrant for unpaid parking tickets

Apparently without thinking this might enrage an officer of
the law, he continued and got his wish when the cop pulled him over.

‘Took a bite out of the cookie. He was so confused and
angry. Told me to hold tight, he is back in his car now,’ he’d soon tweet.

When the officer came back, he’d likely replaced his scowl
with a grin.

‘Says I have a warrant for unpaid parking tickets? Making me
go with him,’ he tweeted.

In the end, Liedtke got his funny joke, but also slapped
with a ticket.

'I'm an idiot': Liedtke tweeted this penitent shot Wednesday evening, evidently as he left an LA police station with his tail between his legs
