On first appearance this luxury family home that has come up for sale looks like it could be the residence of a wealthy stockbroker or lawyer.

In fact the £700,000 property in an affluent, leafy suburb is actually the home of a major drug dealer and his wife.

Craig Blake, 40, is serving 16 years in jail for his role in leading a gang that flooded British streets with cocaine worth £125million.

His wife, Fiona, 41, was jailed for three years for laundering money from her husband’s multi-million pound empire.

But a court has now ruled that Blake must repay nearly £800,000 of his ill-gotten gains under the Proceeds of Crime Act or face an extra four years on his sentence.

In order to do that he has put his large detached home in the upmarket Talbot Woods area of Bournemouth, Dorset, on the market.

But his wife, who lives there with her 
son, 15, and the couple’s daughter, four, is worried about the sale of 
the property due to the stigma of ‘buying a drug dealer’s house’.

The house has four large bedrooms, a large reception hall, sitting room, family room, gymnasium and therapy room, study, two bathrooms, electronic front gates and a large back garden.

It also has underfloor heating and air conditioning in some rooms.

Estate agents selling it describe the property as an ‘exceptional family home situated in the heart of the prestigious location'.

A spokesman from Cliftons estate agents said: 'We have been instructed to sell the house by the occupier and the house is now on the market.

'We are the instructing agent and the response has been great. We have had a number of viewings and it is only a matter of time before we reach sale agreed.'

Blake and his gang of drug traffickers operated in Dorset, Kent and South Wales between 2007 and 2009 and made more than £1million a month supplying cocaine.

They also shipped cocaine to Australia by stashing thousands of pounds of the class A drug into tins of Waitrose soup.

The men owned large houses and drove round in expensive cars and generally led lavish lifestyles.

Blake, his fellow ringleader Robert Quick, 46, and other gang members were caught after officers from Serious Organiser Crime Agency bugged their cars and phone calls as they trafficked drugs along the south coast and the Welsh valleys.

The men were jailed in July 2010 at Cardiff Crown Court.

Blake admitted charges of conspiracy to supply class A drugs.

Last month at the same court his Honour Judge Hopkins QC made Blake subject of the Confiscation Order worth £792,055.

His wife Fiona said: 'He was a builder, and he had rented property, I didn’t think anything different, as far as I was concerned he was a successful property developer.

'I’m at home with the children, and he was a perfect husband and a perfect dad.

'I couldn’t believe it, if you knew me I’m such an honest person and for this to happen to me it’s just been a massive shock.

'I have had to deal with the repercussions. All I understand is it’s a confiscation order, it’s all the assets that they think he had.

'He’s asked me to try and sell it for him while we are living here.

'I’m trying to get my children’s lives back together because the whole family has been apart.

'I’m not going to stay with family, I don’t know what’s happening at the moment, all I know is I have got to try and sell this place just to pay the confiscation order.

'But the stigma that’s attached to it is - do you want to buy a drug dealer’s house?'
