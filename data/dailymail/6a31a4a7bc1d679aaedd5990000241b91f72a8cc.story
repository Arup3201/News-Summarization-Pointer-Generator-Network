Back in March 1898, a group of scientists set sail from London for the Torres Straits between Australia and New Guinea. They were going to study islanders in the hope that they would learn important lessons about the way the brain works.

With them they took various colour photos and some ‘footer shirts’, which they were confident would prove irresistible to natives.

Over the next 14 months, they conducted a series of tests — one scientist would measure people’s sight, another hearing, another skin sensitivity and so on. When they came back, they presented their findings to the British Association For The Advancement Of Science.

Pioneer: Jonathan Pryce as Dr William Rivers in the film Regeneration, based on his work

It was a total disaster. Far from showing any big differences between the way in which a Bornean tribesman perceived the world and, say, a Cambridge academic did, their tests revealed almost no variations at all. Only one conclusion could be drawn, the Association believed: the tests had been hopelessly botched.

The scientists’ efforts were pooh-poohed, their reputations were blackened and that was apparently that.

But over the next few years, doubts began to creep in. Maybe the fact that there were no key differences between people’s senses wasn’t actually a blunder, but a discovery of huge significance.

Far from there being — as was generally accepted — a human evolutionary ladder in which the British stood at the top with everyone else on the lower rungs, maybe we were all essentially the same.

And this is just the arm.... As part of their experiment the scientists would stick needle's into parts of Henry Head's body - including his penis (posed by model)

With their reputations restored, the scientists set out once again, trying to find out how the human brain developed in the way that it did. Originally, smell was by far the dominant sense, but as mammals began to live in trees, sight, sound and taste surged to the fore.

The tricky part, as far as the scientists were concerned, was trying to measure things that seemed to defy analysis — like pain or the way people react to stress.

One of the members of the original expedition, a psychologist called William Rivers, conducted a series of experiments with a fledgling neurologist called Henry Head. The two men would sit in Head’s rooms in Cambridge, with Rivers pulling out Head’s hairs and sticking needles into various parts of his body — including his penis — and recording the results.

Not surprisingly, Head found that he could work for only an hour at a time before he started to feel a bit queasy. In between sessions, the two men would engage in bursts of vigorous exercise such as running or horseriding. The results were encouraging, but what they really wanted was a kind of mass experiment in which large numbers of people could be subjected to the same trauma to see how they reacted. They didn’t have to wait long.

In August 1914, World War I was declared. Within months, Rivers, Head and their fellow scientists were confronted with what amounted to the biggest laboratory on Earth.

What interested them most of all were the effects of prolonged exposure to gunfire. Although it was another of the original expedition members, Charles Myers, who coined the phrase ‘shell shock’, it was Rivers’s work at Craiglockhart Hospital near Edinburgh (where poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen were among his patients) that proved the most significant.

At first, Army doctors would label traumatised soldiers ‘Mental’, ‘Insane’ or even ‘GOK’ (‘God Only Knows’). But as the war went on and it became obvious that soldiers were not faking their symptoms, attitudes started to change and treatments to improve. 

Shell shocked: The scientists were particularity interested in studying the effects of prolonged exposure to gunfire on soldiers

Yet the psychologists were still feeling their way in the dark. William McDougall, who had also been on the original expedition, treated a soldier called Percy Meek, who had been a basket-weaver in Norfolk before the war. As well as having severe shell shock, Meek was suffering from amnesia. Under hypnosis, he revealed that he was visited every night by the ghost of a German soldier whom he had killed on the Marne in 1914.

After a while Meek stopped seeing the ghost, but his condition became even worse — his twitching grew more pronounced, he lost the power of speech and spent all day playing with dolls. There is astonishing archive film of him cowering in a wheelchair with a teddy bear on his kneeMcDougall was inclined to write him off as a helpless case, but then, in 1917, something extraordinary happened: Meek made a spontaneous recovery.

His memory and his speech came back, and within another year he was teaching basket-weaving to fellow patients — proof perhaps that the brain is even more mysterious than McDougall and his colleagues had ever anticipated. 

A war of nerves: Shell shocked soldiers receiving treatment in hospital

As he proved with the critically acclaimed A War Of Nerves: Soldiers And Psychiatrists 1914-1994, Shephard writes exceptionally well about how the mind functions under duress.

His account of how a small group of scientists defied ridicule in their quest to learn how the brain works is as stirring as it is dramatic.

While Shephard clearly possesses a sharp eye for absurdity, there’s a broad streak of sympathy throughout.

In the early Thirties, the Prince of Wales visited the newly founded National Institute For Industrial Psychology in London. By accident, he was taken in through the wrong door and ended up in the office block next door, chatting with bemused office workers under the impression they were psychologists, before someone put him right.

It’s tempting to see this story as an illustration of how psychology developed in this country — there may have been a lot of wrong turns, but eventually its pioneers steered a path through a fog of confusion to reach a greater understanding of who we are and how we got to be that way.
