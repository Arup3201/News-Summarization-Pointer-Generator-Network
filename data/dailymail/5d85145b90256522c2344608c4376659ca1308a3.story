Ireland captain Will Porterfield accused the International Cricket Council of 'shutting doors in the face' of associate nations with their plans to reduce the 2019 World Cup to 10 teams.

The 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand featured 14 teams but the ICC are pressing ahead with plans to streamline the tournament in four years time, a move that Porterfield condemned.

The Ireland captain suggested there was no point in associate nations continuing if the ICC decide to run a 'members only' club and make more money for the elite nations.

The 30-year-old told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'It's frustrating when we keep doing everything that's asked of us by the ICC, and then they keep slapping you in the face with decisions like this.

'Cutting teams is not the way forward. It's only full members, pretty much, they're giving the opportunities to - it may as well be a members' cup, as opposed to a World Cup.

'It's a decision that not only I but a lot of other people completely disagree with. If you look at any other sport around the world, they're looking to expand and develop. The way the ICC are going, they don't seem to be doing that really.

'I think how we've done, and what we've shown over the last few years, merits a place at the World Cup. But the ICC just seem to be shutting doors in your face really.

'It's almost getting to the stage of "What's the point?" for a lot of the teams. If you keep closing the door, they can't get on to the world stage.

'I'd like to know what Dave Richardson's (ICC chief executive) vision for the game is. It's not just Ireland here - we're talking about a global game.

'This is the International Cricket Council. If his vision for the game is to shrink it and make as much money for the top few nations as possible, then come out and say that.' 

Ireland narrowly missed out on a place in the quarter-finals of this World Cup when they were beaten by Pakistan in their decisive group game in Adelaide.

Porterfield's side won three of their first four matches in the tournament including victories over the West Indies and Zimbabwe before falling short against India and Pakistan.

Their impressive performances at this tournament follow their win over Pakistan in Jamaica in 2007 and against England in Bangalore in 2011.

Before the current World Cup, their last ODI against an elite nation was against Sri Lanka in Dublin in May 2014. Ireland are also due to play England and Australia in one-off matches this summer. 

Porterfield added: 'The last four years between World Cups, we've played nine games against top-10 teams. Even if we'd won every single game we played, we still can't break in - so that's what we're up against.'
