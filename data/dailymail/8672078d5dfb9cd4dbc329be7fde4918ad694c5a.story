Streaking across the sky, this massive bolt of lightning was part of a huge electrical storm that brought chaos to rail and road users.

Eurostar had to cancel services after the lightning struck an electrical sub-station next to the Channel Tunnel entrance in Cheriton, Kent, causing a fire. It caused a loss of power and resulted in four Eurostar trains being stopped from travelling through the tunnel in both directions.

Several hundred passengers were delayed as the trains were returned to where they started. A series of smaller blazes also led to commuter rail services out of London being cancelled.

Eerie: Photographer David Shackle, 62, was capturing the sunset over his home town of Folkestone, Kent, last night when 'suddenly the sky went red and clouds rolled in'

Mr Shackle said within seconds the sky changed from red to black, and shortly before 6.15pm the first lightning bolt struck the Creteway housing estate in Folkestone

One of the lightning bolts hit 
25-year-old Sophia Swarbrick’s home in Folkestone, Kent, while she was 
putting her children to bed – but luckily her family escaped injury.

Miss
 Swarbrick said: ‘Fluorescent blue light lit up the house, then the 
whole place rumbled and the lightning hit the roof. It was terrifying.’

Photographer
 David Shackle, 62, captured the astonishing pictures of the lightning 
strike over Folkestone on Thursday night after climbing a hill 
overlooking the port to take pictures of the sunset.

He
 said: 'I thought I would shoot the sunset and I got a nice panorama of 
Folkestone before the sky suddenly went red and it felt very eerie 
indeed.

'The sky changed 
from red to black and clouds came tumbling in, so I decided to stay and 
see what happened.  Then the lightening strikes came - great loud cracks
 from the sky down onto the Creteway housing estate.'

Electric atmosphere: Another CTG (cloud to ground) lightening bolt struck in the same area of the town exactly a minute after the first during last night's storm

Massive storm: The third, and loudest, lightening bolt struck a house in Eversley Road belonging to Sophia Swarbrick, who said on Facebook she cried from fear

Photographer Mr Shackle took this stunning panorama of Folkestone just before sunset last night, just before the sky turned red and an electrical storm struck

Now, however, with a sunshine weekend forecast, you could be forgiven for thinking that it is already summer.

And
 you would not be the only one… The unseasonably warm temperatures have 
tricked some of our most beautiful flowers and trees into blossoming 
early.

Summer bluebells, 
which normally form carpets of blue in May, are already flowering. And 
our gardens are also full of colour from blooming tulips, peach blossom,
 blackthorn and the May tree – which usually only erupts into white 
flowers in time for May Day.

Most plants stop growing when day and night time temperatures fall below 6C (43F) or 4C (39F).

But
 despite the devastating floods up until last month, the average 
temperature was 5.2C (41.4F) throughout winter across Britain – making 
it the fifth warmest winter since records began in 1910.

Because the soil is far warmer than usual, plants have begun their spring growth early.

Three day forecast: Much of Britain will enjoy a warm and sunny weekend, particularly the south east, and the warm temperatures will continue into next week

Official British Summer Time starts on Sunday, but this morning Dartmoor in Devon saw its first snow of the winter or spring, leaving daffodils wilting under the weight

The
 Woodland Trust, which collects sightings of blossom each year for its 
Nature’s Calendar project, has already had 14 reports of bluebells in 
Berkeley, Gloucestershire; Colchester in Essex and as far north as 
Hexham in County Durham.

Last
 year, the average date for bluebell flowering was May 2. Hawthorns have
 began to bud three weeks early and blackthorn, another hedgerow tree, 
is already in blossom.

Meanwhile,
 many daffodils and snowdrops have already bloomed and withered. 
Magnolia have been in full bloom for the last couple of weeks across 
much of the country, while peach blossom, which normally bursts out in 
early April, is now at its peak.

Apple
 trees do not usually flower until late April, but some are already 
showing buds. The Woodland Trust has also had dozens of reports of 
tortoiseshell butterflies and hundreds of sightings of ladybirds.

Dr Kate Lewthwaite, project manager of the Woodland Trust’s Nature’s Calendar, said: ‘Spring is well and truly on its way.’

Guy
 Barter, of the Royal Horticultural Society, said: ‘Spring is running 
two or three weeks earlier than usual. It is due to the temperatures we 
have been having since January.

'Some
 things kept growing through the winter because it was mild and other 
things have started growing because the temperatures have not been as 
cold as they were.’

Stark contrast: The forecast comes just a day after freezing conditions were reported in Devon. Above, snow falls in Princetown in Dartmoor, Devon, yesterday morning

Nicola 
Maxey, of the Met Office, said Sunday could turn out to be the hottest 
day of the year so far, topping this year's highest temperature of 
20.5C, which was recorded in Gravesend, Kent, on 9 March.

She
 said: 'It's going to be warm and sunny in the south east tomorrow, 
particularly in the afternoon, with temperatures of up to 19C.  It will 
be cloudier in the south west, although there will be some sunshine 
there, too, while further north and into Scotland there's a high chance 
that it's going to be quite overcast.

'Also
 in the north east and in north east Scotland tomorrow there's a chance 
of showers, and on Sunday there will be a similar divide across the UK.'

She
 said temperatures were forecast to reach up to 20C or higher on Sunday,
 adding: 'There's a chance we may reach the high so far of 20.5C and 
even just top it slightly in the south.'

The forecast for the early part of next week is more of the high temperatures although it may be wetter and more unsettled.
