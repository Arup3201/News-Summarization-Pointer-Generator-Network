It was ‘dramatically in the public interest’ to publish a story about a nurse having an affair with a patient in Broadmoor high security hospital, a court heard yesterday.

Former Sun news editor Chris Pharo said readers had a right to know if staff were sleeping with patients at the mental health hospital. He is accused of paying for leaks from Robert Neave, a healthcare assistant working at Broadmoor.

Kingston Crown Court heard that in August 2009, The Sun published a report that a nurse at the hospital had been arrested following allegations that she had had sex with a patient.
