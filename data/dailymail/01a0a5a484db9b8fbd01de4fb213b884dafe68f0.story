Ronel Kiyanga, 20, has been jailed for a year for keeping £25,000 which an NHS cancer hospital paid to him by mistake

A 20-year-old man has been jailed for keeping almost £25,000 that an NHS cancer hospital paid into his bank account by mistake.

Ronel Kiyanga decided to keep the money after it was paid to him by The Christie NHS Foundation Trust - a hospital specialising in cancer care which thought it was paying a supplier.

Kiyanga was caught out when the supplier contacted The Christie to tell them that payment had not arrived in its account.

The Christie was earlier emailed by someone who claimed to be from the supplier's finance department, Croydon Crown Court heard.

In the email, it explained that the supplier had changed bank accounts and that future payments should be made into a new account. It is not known who sent the message.

The trust made two payments in October 2012, totalling just over £24,500, into what the Trust believed was the supplier's bank account.

But some time afterwards The Christie, based in Manchester, was contacted by the supplier asking for payment, with the trust realising it had been conned.

Police officers discovered that the bank account the funds had been paid into belonged to Kiyanga, who was arrested in May 2013 at his flat in South Croydon, south London.

When questioned about the money, he falsely claimed it was a compensation payout linked to an accident he was involved in. 

Kiyanga was this month found guilty of retaining wrongful credit and was jailed for a year. 

Investigating officer Detective Constable Rob Wevill said: 'Although we were never able to prove Kiyanga had knowledge of, or was involved in getting the NHS Trust to pay the money into his account, anyone receiving unexpected payments for this amount of money should have reported it to the bank or police.

'Kiyanga, on the other hand, decided to go out almost immediately and spend the money, buying foreign currency and high value tech goods worth over £20,000.

'Anyone who mistakenly receives money into their account should report it to their bank immediately, however large or small the sum.

'In this case it was patently obvious that Kiyanga was not the rightful or intended recipient and he is now facing a custodial sentence for his dishonesty.'

A confiscation hearing, to try to get back the missing £24,500, is due to take place at Croydon Crown Court on June 12.
