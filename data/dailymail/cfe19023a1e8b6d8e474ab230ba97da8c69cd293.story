These photographs may appear to show a magnificent display by the world-renowned Red Arrows – but in reality they reveal remote control replicas which have been made by a father and son ‘stunt pilot’ duo.

Steven Bishop, 52, and son Matthew, 25, have wowed audiences around the world with their quarter-scale aircrafts which cost £10,000 to make and are powered by a small jet engine.

The BA Hawk 22s replicas, which took around twelve months to make, are flown from the safety of the ground by remote control.

The Bishops have become world-renowned stunt pilots - from the ground - and have mesmerised audiences with the remote control Red Arrows planes, pictured

Mr Bishop, from Telford, Shropshire, said the orginial Red Arrows daredevils have even been mesmerised by the 113 inch long replica models.

He said: ‘I started building model aircrafts when I was around six-years-old but it was all very different then.

‘You had one control and were expected to do all the flying with that.

‘On the BA Hawk 22s - which are flown by the Red Arrows - we have 18 different controls on a number of channels so there can be a lot to take in.

‘People are always really impressed and sometimes can't even tell the difference from the real thing.

‘At one airshow the Red Arrows couldn't fly because of the weather so most of their crowd came by to watch us.

The Red Arrows replicas are identical to the real planes and have been flown at air shows around the world. Mr Bishop, from Telford, Shropshire, said the orginial Red Arrows daredevils have even been mesmerised by the replica models

The real deal: The father and son modelled their remote control planes on the real Red Arrows, pictured here returning to their base at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire in August 2011

Steven Bishop and his son Matthew spent approximately one year building the remote control replica BA Hawk 22s, which are the exact planes flown by the Red Arrows

Steven Bishop said: 'At one airshow the Red Arrows couldn't fly because of the weather so most of their crowd came by to watch us. It was quite incredible - after the show we noticed that some of the actual pilots had come by to watch the show'

‘It was quite incredible - after the show we noticed that some of the actual pilots had come by to watch the show.

‘Our popularity has grown incredibly since we started and we now get invitations to fly from around the world.

‘We've recently been invited to Korea to fly so that should be exciting.’

He added: ‘People love the Red Arrows, they're a British institution and people from all over the world want to see them - and if they can't get the real thing that's where we step in.’

Despite being regarded as one of the best radio controlled formation flying teams in the world Steve and Matthew, pictured building one of the planes, only practice when flying at shows

The father and son have become well-known for their miniature Red Arrows planes which have a wing span of 100 inches and weigh around 25kg

The remote control aeroplanes are flown from the safety of the ground. Their popularity as quickly helped Steven and Matthew Bishop become one of the best radio controlled formation flying teams in the world

The Red Arrows replicas are incredibly life-like and even have a little dummy sitting in the cockpit acting as the pilot. The remote control planes have often fooled people across the world who have mistaken them for the real Red Arrows

Despite being regarded as one of the best radio controlled formation flying teams in the world Steve and Matthew only practice when flying at shows.

Mr Bishop added: ‘It's hard to find the time to get out with the planes so we tend to use the shows to fly.

‘It is very difficult but the fact that we're father and son means we know how each other thinks.

‘I normally lead so I shout out instructions then we pull off the stunts together.’
