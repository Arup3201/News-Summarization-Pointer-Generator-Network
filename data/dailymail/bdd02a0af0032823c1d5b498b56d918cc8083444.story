Amanda Knox could receive millions in compensation after being cleared by Italy's top court of murdering Surrey student Meredith Kercher.

The 27-year-old and her former lover Raffaele Sollecito both served four years in prison after being convicted of the murder in 2007.

But two days after being acquitted, she vowed to return to Italy - just two days after being cleared of murdering the British while living in the country.

It is also understood that Knox - who was reportedly paid £2.7million ($4million) for her 2013 book Waiting to Be Heard - will write about the country's judicial system while she is there.

Both Knox and Sollecito are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison.

While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums.

Carlo Dalla Vedova, her Italian lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to The Telegraph. 

Mr Sollecito’s father Francesco told the newspaper: 'You could hardly quantify a compensation figure, it has been such an awful business.'

Mr Dalla Vedova added Miss Knox will go back to Italy after spending some time with her family in America.  

'She loves Italy. She always says she wants to come back,’ The Sunday Times reported Mr Dalla Vedova as saying.

'Certainly she will be back in Italy, she always liked Italy, that's why she came here.’

Mr Vedova was speaking after Knox and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, now 31, were cleared of murdering her former roommate.

The decision by the Supreme Court of Cassation is the final ruling in the seven-year case and definitively ends the gruelling legal battle. The pair always maintained their innocence.

Shortly after the verdict, Knox, who previously said she would never willingly return to Italy, released a statement.

It said she was 'tremendously relieved and grateful' and knowing she was innocent gave her 'strength in the darkest times of this ordeal'. 

She added: 'Throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support from family, friends and strangers. To them, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your kindness has sustained me.' 

Sollecito discovered his conviction had been overturned when his lawyer called him from outside court with the news, exclaiming: 'You have your whole life ahead of you now, Raf.' 

Both Sollecito and Knox were imprisoned shortly after Kercher's body was discovered with 47 separate wounds on November 1, 2007.

They were originally convicted of murder and sexual assault in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively.

Knox breaks down in tears after hearing the verdict that overturned her original conviction and acquitted her in October 2011

But after they served four years in prison a court in Perugia threw out their convictions and declared them innocent.

Knox returned to the US before another U-turn in the sensational case in January last year when a court in Florence reinstated the original 2009 conviction and increased Knox's sentence to 28-and-a-half years.

Judge Gennaro Marasca read the decision to finally acquit the pair on Friday after a judicial body had deliberated for ten hours. It was met with stunned silence.

The pair could now seek compensation. Although the amount is not known it could reach up to seven figures.  

Speaking shortly after the verdict Kercher's mother Arline said she was 'shocked' at the decision to overturn the convictions.

Knox talks on her mobile phone from her mother's Seattle home just moments after hearing Friday's news. After the verdict she said she was 'tremendously relieved and grateful' and knowing she was innocent gave her 'strength in the darkest times of this ordeal'

She said: 'I am a bit surprised and very shocked if I'm honest. I don't know what to say.'

A statement released by the family later said: 'Emotions are naturally raw at this stage. The decision came as a shock but was an outcome we knew was possible, even if it wasn't what we expected.'

Rudy Guede is now the only person to be successfully convicted of the murder.

The unemployed basketball player was found guilty in October 2008 and was convicted to 16 years after his footprints were discovered in Kercher's blood.

The court will publish its reasons for Friday's decision within 90 days.
