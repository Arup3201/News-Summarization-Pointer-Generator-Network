A three-storey scaffolding tower toppled over sideways and trapped a passer-by as high winds buffeted a city centre today.

The woman, believed to be in her 50s, escaped with just minor injuries after dozens of people came to her rescue while she was pinned to the street in Leicester.

The newsagent whose scaffolding collapsed said the trapped woman was saved by his van breaking the metal poles' fall - and the toppling structure also hit a passing bus.

Narrow escape: A woman was trapped under this three-storey scaffolding tower when it toppled over today in high winds in Leicester city centre. It was only up to repair damage from a previous fire at the same shop

Police, paramedics and firefighters were all called to the scene and the road was cordoned off.

Harj Khera, 41, was behind the counter when a customer told him a board had fallen into the road.

'The next minute it all came down,' he said. 'The woman was underneath the whole thing.

'My van was parked outside the shop and the scaffolding landed mostly on the van. Otherwise it would have been a lot worse. The van saved her really.

'It's right in the city centre so within seconds there were 20 or 30 people clambering over the boards to get her out. She looked OK, just shocked.

'The scaffolding was only up because we had a fire not too long ago and the damage was being repaired.

Harj Khera, 41, said: 'Within seconds there were 20 or 30 people clambering over the boards to get her out'

'We're the luckiest shop in Leicester. At least nothing else can happen to us now.'

He added the street always suffers from high winds because it has tall buildings which channel the flow of air.

Eyewitness Sarah Webb, 29, said: 'There was an almighty crash with scaffolding coming down on a bus and cars. There was metal and wood all across the road.

'There was a woman trapped underneath it all but she was moving and talking.

'A fireman said it looked like the wind had caught the scaffolding and brought it all down.

'It's a very busy road with lots of people walking about. It's lucky more people weren't hurt.'

Probe: Building inspectors and the Health and Safety Executive examined the structure, which also hit a bus

Council building inspectors and staff from the Health and Safety Executive were at the scene.

A Leicestershire Police spokesman said: 'We were called at 11.30am to a report of some scaffolding that had collapsed in Charles Street in Leicester.

'An officer along with the fire and ambulance services were at the scene, the road was closed for a short time and one woman was injured in the incident.'

The Met Office warned there would be gale force winds today and tomorrow as it issued an amber weather warning for snow in northern England and Scotland.

The snowfall prompted travel disruption and health fears across large parts of the country, with temperatures expected to plunge as far as minus 10C and reports of hail storms in Cambridge.
