Marcos Rojo made his Manchester debut on Sunday afternoon as Louis van Gaal's side searched for their first three points of the season with a win against QPR.

His starting role at left-back on Sunday gave the United faithful a chance to catch a glimpse of the Argentine's impressive set of tattoos.

Rojo boasts a torso of tatts including a couple of tattoos in English, the most visible being 'Pride' on his right leg and 'Glory' on his left leg. 'For My Family' is also above his chest. Another is dedicated to former club Estudiantes de la Plata, where he won the Copa Libertadores trophy in 2009.
