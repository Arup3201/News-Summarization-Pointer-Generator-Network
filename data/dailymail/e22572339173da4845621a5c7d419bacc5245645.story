Shamed Reverend Paul Flowers is reportedly set to leave Britain and join a strict Christian group in the United States just weeks after allegations of his shocking drug abuse came to light.

The Co-Operative Bank chairman, who was apparently caught buying and using illegal drugs just days after he was grilled by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee over the bank's disastrous performance, will accept an invitation from the Mennonites once a police probe into drug allegations is concluded.

The group has close ties with the Amish religion, which is a sub-set of the Mennonite church. A source said the group will 'not tolerate a lifestyle of drugs and sex'.

Dubbed the Crystal Methodist, Rev Flowers, 63, was caught on an undercover video discussing the cocaine and 
crystal meth he allegedly wanted.

He was arrested shortly after the recording was released in connection with a drugs supply investigation.

The Daily Mirror reports that the Mennonite group are willing to forgive Flowers, 63, for his previous sins and accept him into their group.

A source told the paper: 'He thinks this opportunity will give him the perfect chance to get back his God away from the limelight.

'The Mennonites are very religious and have a strong moral code and will expect him to behave himself.

They
will not tolerate a lifestyle of drugs and sex but they are prepared to
forgive him his previous sins and open their community up to him.'

Amish people, usually based in North America, live a modest life without technology, and generally live on farms in segregated communities. Because they shun modern technology, the people can often be seen riding in horse-drawn carriages in their traditional and modest dress.

Although Flowers may not be living in an Amish community, the Mennonites will 'not tolerate a lifestyle of drugs and sex'

The Mennonites are a strict Christian group founded in the 1500s in Europe.

There are thought to be around 50 sub-set groups in the United States, including the Amish religion.

In 2012, there were nearly two million Mennonites worldwide.

Although they are mostly associated with the United States, Mennonites can also be found in Canada, Ethiopia, India and several other countries around the world.

Mennonites generally believe in pacifism and helping communities.

They take pride in volunteering to help others, and are particularly active in helping people who have seen their houses or possessions ruined by natural disaster.

Flowers has not been seen at his church-owned home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, since the allegations of drug taking emerged last month.

He has also been suspended from taking worship.

A series of damning text messages were also released to The Mail on Sunday, showing that Flowers was allegedly using hard drugs in the days surrounding a crucial testimony to the Treasury Committee on November 6.

He was suspended by both the church and the Labour Party following allegations that he bought and used illegal drugs.

He has apologised over claims involving crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine.

The Co-Operative Bank have launched an inquiry into Flowers, who earned Â£132,000 a year as chairman.

The minister stepped down from his role 
as Co-Op chairman in June and questions have since been asked about
his competence in the role.

He has also been engulfed in allegations
of gay sex, questions over his expenses claims at a 
drug charity and drink-driving.

It also emerged he had resigned as a Labour councillor after adult material was discovered on his computer.

Flowers
has been a Methodist minister for 40 years and formerly chaired drugs 
charity Lifeline, whose motto is: 'Telling the Truth About Drugs.'
