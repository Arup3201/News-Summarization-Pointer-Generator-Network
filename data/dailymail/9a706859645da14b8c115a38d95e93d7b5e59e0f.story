A body discovered 40ft up a tree on a golf course after a dog found a human arm has been identified as a Lithuanian man who was missing for three years.

Jurij Sliachtecov, a 21-year-old Lithuanian, was first reported missing in early May 2011.

At first the police and his friends believed he had returned to his native Lithuania because he had taken his passport.

He was last seen out with friends in Bournemouth in late April 2011.

However, it was soon realised he had not returned home and a feature about his disappearance appeared on the Lithuanian version of Crimewatch.

It was only when a dog emerged from a bush at Meyrick Park golf club, near Bournemouth, holding a human arm in its mouth on March 31 that police were called.

The discovery sparked a massive police search and more remains were found that day 40ft up in the branches of a tree.

A man, who lived near the gold course, approached the officers the following day clutching two more human bones in a clear plastic bag.

He had taken them home after finding them at the spot last year but did not tell anyone or call police.

A spokesman for Dorset Police told the Western Daily Press that formal identification has not yet been carried out but they believe the body is that of the missing Lithanian.

An inquest is expected to be opened and adjourned later this week and cause of death is yet to be established. At this stage the death is not being treated as suspicious.

Discovery: A spokesman for Dorset Police said last night that officers had found 'additional human remains'

A spokesman for Dorset Police said at the time that officers had found 'additional human remains' in an inaccessible place, high up in a tree.

'They have been found high up in a tree.

The remains have not yet been identified,' the spokesman added.

As the body decomposed, it is believed the bones fell to the ground.

Teams of police forensic experts with tracker dogs worked in a large sealed off section of Meyrick Park golf course.

A private ambulance was called to the scene to take the hand away to be examined at a hospital mortuary.

The golf club remained open to players who were stopped from using just one hole by blue and white police tape.

A spokesman for Dorset Police said a pathologist confirmed the hand to be human, prompting a thorough search of the woodland with police sniffer dogs.

It was described as being in 'fairly advanced' stage of decomposition.

Police were left baffled today after discovering a badly decomposed body in woodlands at a golf course

The limb, which had been detached from just below the elbow, did not have any remnants of clothing or other type of covering on it, and had no distinguishing features. There were no rings on the fingers.

Files on missing people were examined for clues about who the arm belonged to.

Residents living near to the golf course regularly walk their dogs on the land surrounding the holes and were stopped by the investigation.

One walker, who did not want to be named, said: 'Everyone who walks up here has said it’s an arm or a hand. It’s not very nice, it’s sad to think it’s been in that woodland without anyone knowing.'
