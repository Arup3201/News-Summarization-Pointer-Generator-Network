Her fans wanted her 
to become as large as possible and she quickly became a star in a 
bizarre fantasy fetish community that worshipped the overweight and bought pizzas for her to munch on.

But 
life is changing for Donna Simpson. The 600lb mother-of-two
moved from New Jersey to Akron, Ohio, after her five-year 
relationship with fiancé Philippe Gouamba, 49, ended earlier this year.

The
5’4" woman has also turned away from the fantasy world, replacing 
videos of her eating with a blog about her journey to health. Ms Simpson
has already lost 85lbs on her long road to weight loss.

‘I realised that I was their 
fantasy,’ she said of her viewers who paid her to buy more food. ‘Here I
was getting bigger and bigger, and they had their thin wives, with two-and-a-half kids and a picket fence.

‘I'm not trying to be a size 4 (or) a thin-mint,’ said the 44-year-old, who is believed to be the heaviest woman ever to have given birth. ‘I just want to be normal and more active.’

One
man from Germany sent her a credit card with specific instructions of 
buying pizzas, Chinese food and other takeaways, as he wanted her to use
his money to become as large as possible.

‘He didn't even need to see me. Just the fact that he was feeding me was enough of a thrill for him.’

Ms
Simpson had a website where men paid $19 a month to watch her eat and 
she flew around the world for events. She became the most popular model 
on SupersizedBombshells.com.

But
now she has moved back to her hometown of Akron and embarked on a new 
plan. It was a big change as she requires a mobility scooter to go 
shopping and wears XXXXXXXL clothing.

Fat fans: Ms Simpson also said some of the people who watched her were rich lawyers, accountants and college students who wanted to see women whom they believe are attractive

Mother and daughter: Ms Simpson entered the record books when she gave birth to Jacqueline, now four. She hopes to join a gym soon to begin walking in a pool and has modified her eating

She hopes to join a gym soon to 
begin walking in a pool and has modified her eating. Ms Simpson has 
struggled to lose weight for years and weighed about 200lbs at school in
Summit County, Ohio.

She 
often ate an apple a day along with a weight-loss drink and even smoked 
crack cocaine for a few months several years ago in an attempt to shed 
pounds, but claims not to have become addicted.

‘All
it did was make me clean my house really, really fast,’ she said. But 
Ms Simpson still wants to drop to about 300lbs, to help her raise her 
daughter Jacqueline, 4, and 15-year-old son, Devin.

Ms
Simpson dismissed those who may be stunned by someone who weighs that 
much. She said she would be healthier and happier than when men watched 
her and sought her out.

Ms Simpson
also said some of the people who watched her were rich lawyers, 
accountants and college students who wanted to see women whom they 
believe are attractive.

One
man from California sent her $200 a week through Western Union to buy 
groceries. For about six weeks earlier this year he would call her to 
find out the list of foods she bought, she said.

All over: She moved from New Jersey to Akron, Ohio, after her five-year relationship with fiancé Philippe Gouamba, 49, ended. She had a website where men paid $19 a month to watch her eat

When she told him that she was done in
the fantasy world, the man became angry. ‘It's not like these were 
toothless trolls who live under bridges,’ Ms Simpson said.

The
underground community is involved in a rare form of masochism known as 
feederism, said Stephen Levine, the co-director of the Center for 
Marital and Sexual Health in Beachwood, Ohio.

Some people love watching others become overweight and the internet helped it take off, he said.

‘I'm
hesitant to say why someone would do this,’ said Janet Shibley Hyde, a 
University of Wisconsin psychology professor. ‘There could be all kinds 
of reasons. But people cannot survive at that weight.’

Ms
Simpson proclaimed three years ago: ‘I love being fat; I wouldn't even 
mind weighing 1,000lbs.’ She suddenly began appearing in the U.S. and British media, and got to travel the world.

It
was claimed last year that her meal on Christmas 2010 was two 25lb 
turkeys, two maple-glazed hams, 15lbs of potatoes, five loaves of bread 
and 20lbs of vegetables. But she denies it was that big.

However Ms Simpson admitted she 
earned $1,000 a month from the pay-per-view eating at one point. ‘That's
pretty good for eating Ho-Ho's,’ she said.

‘There are plenty of men who will buy you four pizzas and enjoy watching you eat all of them. But what it comes down to is that you become a slave to the food and to your feeder'

Ms Simpson
has moved away from the internet days, though many are angry that she 
has exposed a rare and underground community. Others are mad that they 
can no longer see her.

Her blog describes the pain of feederism and her journey. She is expecting a difficult fight.

‘There
are plenty of men who will buy you four pizzas and enjoy watching you 
eat all of them,’ she wrote. ‘But what it comes down to is that you 
become a slave to the food and to your feeder.’

Ms
Simpson knows that not everyone will be supportive of her bid to lose 
weight. ‘I have only myself to blame for the position I am currently 
in,’ she wrote on her blog.

‘I
must now face the greatest challenge of my life. In order for the 
people I love most to have a happy and healthy life, I must regain my 
emotional and physical well-being.’
