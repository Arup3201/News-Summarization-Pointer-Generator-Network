A drug addict who was caught stealing money from a 98-year-old dementia sufferer has been jailed again after going on a spending spree with a pensioner's bank card.

Kelly Bolam was jailed for 20 months last year after she was caught on hidden cameras stealing from dementia sufferer Edward Elliott after she had befriended him.

Eight months later while out on licence she stole hundreds of pounds from a 76-year-old man.

Kelly Bolam has been sentenced to 12 months in prison after she went on a spending spree with a pensioner's bank card

A court heard she went on a spending spree after getting hold of his bank card and pin number after befriending him.

A judge at Newcastle Crown Court has branded the 34-year-old's offences as 'wicked and vile' and sent her back to prison for 12 months.

Sentencing her for nine counts of fraud, Mr Recorder Singh told Bolam: 'I regard you as someone who deliberately targets vulnerable people.

'This is not the first time you have carried out this kind of confidence fraud by befriending someone who has either got dementia or, on the last occasion, was 98-years-old.

'On this occasion you again targeted a vulnerable elderly complainant. You don’t seem to have learned your lesson. These are wicked and vile offences committed on people with little money or income.'

Bolam first made contact with the latest victim by approaching him in the street and asking if the pensioner wanted to buy an Xbox game.

Bolam last year pleaded guilty to burglary and false representation after being caught on CCTV stealing from a 98-year-old dementia sufferer

The next day she went to his home in Newcastle, where he lives alone, and managed to get his bank card and pin number off him.

Tim Gittins, prosecuting, said: 'She was then able, over the next few days, to use the card, both for his use and, more importantly, for her own purposes. She obtained goods and services and took out cash on a number of occasions.'

By the end of her spending spree Bolam had deprived the pensioner of £560. Eventually the victim became suspicious and spoke to his friend, who persuaded him to go to the police.

The court heard his bank refunded the cash withdrawls but not the £170 spent on goods.

Bolam, also known as Sewell, formerly of Benwell, Newcastle, pleaded guilty to nine offences of fraud.

Christopher Dorman-O’Gowan, defending, said: 'The facts speak for themselves and coupled with her antecedents they speak even louder. She has a drug problem although she tells me she’s off methadone and has been working as a cleaner and in a kitchen.'

In the offences last year on the 98-year-old, it was reported Bolam pleaded guilty to burglary and false representation after being caught on CCTV. She had befriended dementia sufferer Edward Elliott, who lived alone and had no family to support him. Bolam was caught when police installed the hidden cameras at the victim’s home.
