Michael Cope, 28, was due to stand trial at Manchester Crown Court for 25-year-old Linzi Ashton's murder, but suddenly entered a guilty plea

The ex-boyfriend of Linzi Ashton, the young mother whose battered body sparked a month-long manhunt, has admitted her murder.

Michael Cope, 28, was due to stand trial at Manchester Crown Court for the pretty 25-year-old's murder, but suddenly entered a guilty plea.

The body of Miss Ashton, described as a 'loving and doting mother' by her family and friends, was found at her home in Winton, Salford on June 29 - sparking a manhunt for her killer.

Cope went on the run immediately after the killing, and finally handed himself in after five weeks.

He showed no emotion as he pleaded. The killer has also admitted three assaults on Miss Ashton, including strangling her twice and headbutting her in the months before the murder.

He will be sentenced at 10.30am tomorrow.

He had previously protested his innocence.

Miss Ashton had lived with her two daughters, Destiny, seven, and Daisy, two, after she split up with her youngest child’s father, Liam Grime.

The break-up was amicable and it is understood the two had remained close friends.

He was bringing Daisy back to Miss Ashton’s house when he came across the murder scene and found his former partner lying dead with horrific facial injuries.

The shock of the murder on June 29 swept around her estate and tributes were also paid to her in Eccles town centre, where she worked as a barmaid at the Duke of York.

Mr Grime posted a picture of himself with his arm around his ex-girlfriend on Facebook: 'Who could want to hurt her? I love you Linzi.'

He thanked friends for their ‘kind 
messages’, adding: ‘Although we were not together, Linzi was and still 
is the love of my life.’

It is thought Cope had been sleeping rough just yards from where he was finally arrested.

After five weeks on the run 28-year-old Cope handed himself in at a terrace house in Leigh.

Firearms officers had surrounded the address, on a quiet cul-de-sac, but Cope walked calmly out and gave himself up.

The arrest followed several reports of sightings in the area and a very high police presence on the estate for several days.

At the time of her death dozens of bouquets of flowers were 
left outside the Duke of York pub in Eccles, which is run by Miss 
Ashton’s family and where she worked. The pub was closed as a mark of 
respect. One message read: ‘RIP Linzi, you will be sadly missed. So 
young, so gentle.’

Paula Morrison, 40, wept as she laid flowers, saying: ‘Linzi was a lovely girl.

‘I’ve known her for years and when I 
got a phone call telling me what had happened, you could have blown me 
down with a feather.

'She was a beautiful young woman, happy-go-lucky and
 enjoyed life and her two little girls. It is such a shame for them and 
the whole family.'
