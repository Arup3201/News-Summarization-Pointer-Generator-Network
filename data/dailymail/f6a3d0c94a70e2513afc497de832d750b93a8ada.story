The Greenpeace campaigners who scaled The Shard yesterday to raise awareness of drilling in the Arctic said they were confident oil company Shell had 'got the message' as they were released on bail.

Six women climbed the 310m building at London Bridge yesterday, after getting past security in the early hours and were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass afterwards.

The group had planned to unveil a giant artwork when they reached the top but only one climber made it all the way.

Wiola Smul - the youngest of the group who attempted the gruelling 15-hour climb - released a 'Save 
the Arctic' banner when she reached the summit yesterday.

All six women were arrested at around 
7.30pm and were allowed to rest in police cells overnight before being 
questioned today. They have all since been released on police bail.

Liesbeth Deddens, 31, 
from the Netherlands, Wiola Smul, 23, from Poland, Sabine Huyghe, 33, from 
Belgium, Sandra Lamborn, 29, from Stockholm, Ali Garrigan, 27, from 
Manchester, UK, and Victoria Henry, 32, a Canadian who lives in London, were 
met with cheers as they left Walworth police station in south east London one by one.

Ms Deddens wasÂ  pictured smiling in the back of a police van last night as she was driven away.

Speaking after being bailed today she
said: 'It was all definitely worth it. We went out there to make a 
point towards Shell and I think we managed to do that.

'The climb was much harder and longer than we expected.It was a really long day and the last
part was harder than any of us imagined. After ten hours it was so much
harder than we thought.

Although the group did not unveil the artwork as planned, the sole climber who reached the top unfurled a flag

'I think they have got the message. I hope so.'

Greenpeace protester Wiola Smul who made it to the top of The Shard said it was a 'great feeling'.

The 23-year-old from Poland said: 'It was a great 
feeling at the top but it would've been better if I was there with 
someone.

'When you're alone, it is hard to 
enjoy the situation but I still have a great feeling. When I did that 
and opened the flag it was really nice.

'The last part was definitely the 
hardest because we are not climbing on the construction, but on the 
balcony. It was very hard and very physical.

'Everyone inside was shouting 'you're 
great' and some guy wrote a message on the paper and showed us.

'I can feel all my muscles today but I'm really happy, really happy but a little bit tired.'

Taking action: Not all the climbers made it to the top of the 310m building

British Ali Garrigan, 27, was the first to be released on bail.

Still wearing her climbing gear she said: 'The climb was difficult but everything went to plan.'

She said the group had trained together at several indoor and outdoor locations for about two months before the climb.

They kept in contact throughout the day via mobile phone as they couldn't hear each other in the windy conditions, she said.

But she added she did regret the group not being able to show the artwork.

'The first thing I thought about when I
woke up was that we didn't get the banner up,' she said. 'It was 22mph winds up 
there so we couldn't have got it out safely.

'I had a sense of elation and sadness that we didn't get the main artwork up.'

Statement of intent: A policeman and emergency services watch as six women activists climb The Shard

Lofty ambitions: Greenpeace said the women would hang a huge work of art that 'captures the beauty of the Arctic' if they made it to the top of the 72-storey building, but this was later abandoned

Co-climber Sandra Lamborn, from 
Stockholm, said she was tired and 'feeling sore' but said the media 
coverage meant the group had 'made our point'.

She they group relied on water, 
chocolate and energy bars to keep going, but said going to the toilet 
using a bottle was difficult.

She added: 'There were windows 
everywhere and people were trying to talk to us so we just like 'please 
go away, we need to pee'.'

Belgian Sabine Huyghe showed reporters her bruises as she left the police station on bail this afternoon.

Iconic: The Shard was designed by architect Renzo Piano to resemble a shard of ice - which made it the 'perfect' site for an Arctic art installation, Greenpeace said

Pioneering: If the group had managed to hang the Arctic artwork, it would have been the highest successful installation of an art project since Philippe Petit tightrope-walked between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1974

She said: 'I was less stressed doing 
to climb than I expected but I'd prepared myself mentally. We all 
prepared so much for so long it was a big shock when we were finally 
doing it.

'I never thought about stopping. Obviously towards the end, I was getting more tired.

'We got messages along the way and one of the group had Twitter so we were updated on that with messages of support.

'Shell got a message but I'm not sure what's going to happen with that but I hope it goes further.'

While Canadian Victoria Henry said she was thrilled with the attention the climb had attracted.

She said: 'I'm just coming to grips with it now how much press coverage there has been but that's the reason we did it.

'I spoke to my mum in Canada and the media is calling her but that is the reason for it - to shout it from the rooftops.

'I realised how big it was when we got to the police station and people were recognising us.'

On alert: A Shard spokesman said they had worked to ensure the safety of the climbers as well as workers and visitors to the centre

Publicity stunt: The demonstrators were live-streaming the climb from helmet cameras, with bird's-eye views of their ascent being broadcast live online

Emergency response: Police were called to The Shard at around 4.20am to reports of protesters attempting to climb the building

Eye-catching: The stunt attracted a lot of attention in the surrounding area

Greenpeace wants the area around the North Pole to be made a global sanctuary, off limits to industrialisation.

More than three million people have backed their call at savethearctic.org.

It is believed the activists climbed on the roof of London Bridge train station to access the skyscraper.

Onlookers took to Twitter to describe the scenes around the building.

Lydia Anne Wild said: 'Thought a bomb 
had gone off by the amount of police around London Bridge - instead, 
Greenpeace are hanging off the Shard.'

A Shell 
spokesman said: 'We respect the right of individuals and organisations 
to engage in a free and frank exchange of views about our operations.

'Recognising
the right of individuals to express their point of view, we only ask 
that they do so with their safety and the safety of others, including 
Shell personnel and customers, in mind.'

The company said oil and gas production from the Arctic was not new.

Ready for action: The women began their ascent by climbing on top of the adjacent London Bridge train station

Prepared: Greenpeace said it carried out a safety assessment before the climb

'The Arctic region currently produces about 10 per cent of the world's oil and 25 per cent of its gas,' it said in a statement.

'If responsibly developed, Arctic energy resources can help offset supply constraints and maintain energy security for consumers throughout the world.

'Shell has been operating in the Arctic and sub-Arctic since the early 20th century, giving us the technical experience and know-how to explore for and produce oil and gas responsibly.

'We work extensively with global Arctic stakeholders to research and develop standards and best practice on biodiversity, ecology, marine sound, oil spill prevention and response, safety and health.'

The Shard was designed by architect 
Renzo Piano to resemble a shard of ice - which made it the 'perfect' 
site for an Arctic art installation, Greenpeace said.

It is the tallest building in western Europe and contains offices, 
restaurants, the five-star Shangri-La hotel, exclusive 
residential apartments and the capital's highest viewing gallery, The 
View from The Shard, offering 360-degree views.
