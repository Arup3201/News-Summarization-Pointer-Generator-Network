Tragic: Wilson Alexis, 21, was shot dead when a fight broke out during a baptism party in Miami early Sunday morning

A 21-year-old man was shot dead while trying to break up a fight between uninvited guests at a baptism party early Sunday morning.

Two shots were fired when Wilson Alexis tried to stop five women and a man brawling at the North Miami Beach home about 4am over a lack of food and utensils.

The wounded man was rushed to Ryder Trauma Center where he died.

Alexis' devastated family are struggling to come to terms with the senseless act.

'My boy was good. He never got in any trouble,' Alexis' mother, Acelia Desinor, told CBS4.

Alexis' father, Francoeur Alexis, said it was in his son’s nature to help people.

'He was trying to help them out and help them get out of the fight and break it up,' he said.

'I feel so sad. I feel so sad. I am so 
sorry for him. He was a 21-year-old who never had any serious problems. 
He never got in a fight or trouble. This is terrible.'

He said his son, who graduated from Miami Edison Senior High School when he was 17, aspired to be a crime scene investigator.

'My son, he was a good guy because he got his high school diploma when he was 17-years-old,' Francoeur Alexis said.

'After
 that, I sign him to college, and he went to college. After that, he never gave me any problems. I've never
 seen no one coming into my house and doing anything wrong.'

Police said the tragedy unfolded after dozens of uninvited guests crashed the house party at N.E.159th Street and N.E. 15th Avenue on Saturday night.

Jameson Joseph told Miami Herald news partner CBS4 that he posted about the bash at his home on social media site, Tagged.com, but didn’t mention an address.

Joseph was holding the party for his five-month-old godchild. Alexis did not live at the home.

Members of the Joseph family told everyone to leave early Sunday morning when the party got out of control. There were about 100 people at the small home.

That's when a brawl erupted outside the home about 4am and Alexis was shot.

Police arrived on scene after the shooting.

'I wished it never happened,' Joseph said. 'I feel terrible. I wished I never held the party.'

Joseph said he didn't know the victim but felt terrible.

'I can't even explain it. I haven't slept in two days. I haven't eaten. I kind of feel like it's my responsibility, and that hurts me so much,' he told WSVN.com.

Thomas Carney, North Miami Beach Director of Police Services, said  detectives are
trying to interview those who stayed at the scene. Only about 18 to 20 of the estimated 100 guests stayed behind.

'With that many people, somebody had to have seen something,' he said.

The victim's parents hope someone comes forward with information.

'Someone needs to get caught,' Francoeur Alexis said. 'My son didn’t deserve this.'
