With such a clear catchphrase - ‘enjoy Coca Cola’ - you’d think any celebrity endorser would know exactly what they had to do to keep their sponsor happy.

But Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho committed a cardinal marketing sin at a press conference when he was seen beside two cans of competitor Pepsi.

The error has cost the 32-year-old a cool £500,000 a year after Coca Cola decided it had no choice but to terminate the contract which was due to run until 2014.

Ronaldinho reportedly took a sip from one of the cans during the question and answer session for his new club Atletic Mineiro which he joined last month.

The soft drink giant said it could no longer continue working with the two-time Fifa world player of the year. A statement released on Monday read: 'Coca Cola recognizes the career and the value of Ronaldinho.

'However due to recent developments it has become impossible to continue the partnership.'

The mistake may not have been all Ronaldinho’s fault however, Atletico Mineiro is sponsored by Pepsi and the cans are thought to be put on tables during press conferences as a matter of course.

Ironically the photographs, which clearly show the world’s former best player next to the two cans of Pepsi, have probably received more publicity since Coca Cola made the decision to cancel the lucrative deal with Ronaldinho.

Kissing goodbye to thousands: The loss of the Coca Cola contract is the latest in a string of setbacks for the former Barcelona star who is still in a legal dispute with his former club Flamengo

Ronaldinho was speaking at the conference to help promote an upcoming game with Atletico Mineiro.

The loss of the Coca Cola contract is the latest setback in a string of problems the former Barcelona star has faced.

He left Rio de Janeiro club Flamengo on May 31 after suing the club for unpaid wages and bonuss.

However, Flamengo have hit back and filed a counter-suit against him claiming he was unprofessional and showed a lack of commitment while at the club.

The striker was accused of being lazy in training sessions, drinking too much and going out to nightclubs and parties too often.

It was reported on Brazilian news outlet Xinha that a marketing manager for Coca Cola said: 'That was the last straw for the company but I don't think it was the only reason.

'He didn't perform up to expectations and his name was associated more with negative than positive news.'
