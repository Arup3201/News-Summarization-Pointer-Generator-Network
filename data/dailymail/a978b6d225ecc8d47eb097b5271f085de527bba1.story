A daredevil adventurer has achieved an incredible feat that would make many rock climbers go weak at the knees.

With few breaks and barely any food in his stomach, James McHaffie climbed 100 extreme routes in the Lake District in a single day.

The adrenaline junkie overcame mental and physical exhaustion to complete the centenary of solo climbs in an astonishing 19 hours.

Don't look down: The professional climber began his quest at 3:30am and completed it at 10:15pm

Mr McHaffie decided to pursue the feat after he was inspired in his teens by climber Ron Fawcett, who soloed 100 extreme climbs in the Peak District in the 1980s.

The professional climber and instructor had 20 five-minute breaks throughout the day and ate only an egg sandwich halfway through his achievement on a Monday in June. 

Equipped with a head torch, Mr McHaffie began his epic quest on the Central Buttress of Scafell – considered one of the hardest climbs in the UK at 470ft – in darkness at about 3:30am.

From there, he scaled cliffs ranging from E1 to E4 in difficulty – with names such as Guillotine, Finger Flake Finish and Green Eggs and Ham – and traversed miles of mountainous terrain as he walked from cliff to cliff.

The 33-year-old, who lives in North Wales but is originally from the Lake District, ended his day 10:15pm when he completed a climb forebodingly called Angels Highway on Castle Rock in Cumbria.

Mr McHaffie is considered one of the UK’s top climbers and he has previously soloed many of the climbs that he completed that day.

He said: ‘At the end of the first climb, the Central Buttress, I was exultant even though I had 99 to go. I had the best day of climbing of my life to look forward to.

‘At the end I felt exhausted and “the moments passed” feeling. I felt contented for long afterwards as it had been high in my mind for years.’
