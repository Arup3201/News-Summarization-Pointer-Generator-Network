Samantha Cameron flew the flag for British designers today as she chose a Burberry coat, Joseph trousers and L.K. Bennett shoes for her debut outfit on the first day of her husband's U.S. state visit.

The Prime Minister's wife looked thoroughly chic in the all-black ensemble - though she may have regretted buttoning it all the way to the top given the sweltering heat at the Baltimore, Maryland Airforce base the Camerons' British Airways flight landed at this afternoon, where temperatures reached towards the eighties.

The cropped trench, worn by Mrs Cameron neatly belted in the middle, is from British fashion house Burberry's current Spring/Summer 2012 collection, and retails for around £595.

Her trousers, slim-cut cigarette pants from upmarket high street store Joseph, are one of the PM's wife's favourite styles.

She has worn them on many previous occasions - including to Burberry's most recent fashion show, where she sat front row.

The shoes are by British high street label L.K. Bennett, a firm favourite too with both the Duchess of Cambridge, who frequently wears L.K. Bennett on official engagements, and her sister Pippa Middleton. 

The style worn by Mrs Cameron today is the bestselling £185 Harper - a detail that will be of added interest to the American audience following this week's news that the British high street brand has expanded Stateside with the opening of a number of new stores.

Today's outfit, with its trendy 
trousers and designer trench, proved that Mrs Cameron remains very much a
21st century consort. Unfettered by stuffy etiquette, her choice of 
outfit is confident and contemporary.

Mrs
Cameron also famously chose to go hat-free for last year's royal 
wedding, a move that while criticised by some traditionalists as disrespectful, was regarded by many as proof that Mrs Cameron is a thoroughly modern woman with her 
own strong sense of style.

Mr
and Mrs Cameron's trip to Washington is part of a three-day visit, 
where the Prime Minister will engage in talks with U.S. President Barack
Obama.

David Cameron will 
join President Obama this evening at a NCAA basketball playoff game in 
Dayton, Ohio, while Samantha Cameron will join Michelle Obama for 
further social engagements.

The trench worn by Samantha Cameron today is featured on the Burbery website, styled with the neck open, and the belt knotted in the middle, just as Mrs Cameron chose to do.

The double breasted slim fit trench is described as being crafted from a woven cotton fabric in a sateen finish, with features such as epaulettes, a gun flap, rain shield and back vents.

The trench is priced at £595 ($935).
