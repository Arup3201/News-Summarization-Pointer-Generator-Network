Castleford coach Daryl Powell has delayed deciding his team for the Challenge Cup final against Leeds in order to give forward Craig Huby as long as possible to prove his fitness.

The 28-year-old prop dislocated his left elbow in the Tigers' 28-6 semi-final win over Widnes 12 days ago but took part in a light training session at Wembley on Friday afternoon with the joint heavily strapped.

'Huby has trained okay,' coach Daryl Powell told reporters pitchside. 'Obviously they're not bashing each other around there but he's done a fair bit of work this week.

Waiting until the last minute: Castleford coach Daryl Powell has delayed naming his team for the final 

Castleford (from): Dixon, Shenton (capt), Webster, Carney, Dorn, Sneyd, Lynch, Milner, Huby, Hauraki, Massey, Clark, Holmes, Mariano, Wheeldon, Ellis, Finn, Jewitt, Carvell.

Leeds: Harkaker; Briscoe, Watkins, Moon, Hall; Sinfield (capt), McGuire; Leuluia, Burrow, Peacock, Delaney, Ablett, Jones-Buchanan. Subs: Kirke, Bailey, Aiton, Sutcliffe.

TV: LIVE on BBC1 from 2.30pm (kick-off 3pm). 

Referee: Phil Bentham

Venue: Wembley Stadium 

'He'll have a fitness test in the morning. Hopefully he'll be fit. But we'll have a look in the morning and just make sure he's ready to go.

'We've got to give him as much opportunity as he needs. He's an important player for us. I'm pretty confident he'll be okay. If he plays, he will be fit.'

Powell insists the club have carried out all the relevant medical checks and says Huby himself will help make the final decision.

'It's me and him.' said Powell. 'We've done all that, there's no major issues from that point of view.

'He's got to be confident that he can deliver his best performance and, if he tells me that he is and I see him do a couple of things in the morning, then we'll go with that.' 

Recovery: Huby dislocated his elbow less than two weeks ago but may recover in time for Saturday's final

 Leeds coach Brian McDermott, who named his team at the start of the week, expects Huby to play.

'I think he's got a chance,' McDermott said. 'He's dislocated his elbow, which to your average man in the street means a number of months off.

'But it looked like it went back in. (They will) strap it up and put some injections in it. He's an important part of what they do.'

Cup fever: Castleford supporters gave their team a rapturous send -off as they headed to Wembley 

Head to head: Tigers' Michael Shenton and Leeds Rhinos' Kevin Sinfield will do battle on Saturday
