 A Chinese baby is struggling to learn to walk and crawl because she has giant tumours on one side of her body, making her chest and her right arm swell.

One-year-old Xinlei, of Mingxian County, in the Gansu Province of China, was born with an egg-sized tumour on her chest and doctors 
diagnosed her as having congenital haemangioma and lipoma.

Haemangiomas are actually types of birthmarks and are rarely more than a raised lump on the skin. 

One-year-old Chinese toddler Xinlai suffers from giant tumors on one side of her body, which make her chest on the right side and her right arm swell

And a lipoma is a soft, fatty lump that grows under the skin, and can occur on any area of skin where there are fat cells. It is harmless and can usually be left alone.

But in little Xinlei's case, as she has grown older the tumours have spread over her right side, making it difficult for her to move and meaning she is in constant discomfort.

Father Wang
Wei and his wife Wang Jinfang are now trying to raise 200,000 Yuan (£20,000) in surgery fees to help cure their daughter Xinlei.

Her parents are now trying to raise money to treat the one year old for her unusual growth condition. It leaves her in almost constant discomfort

The little girl's growth is caused by congenital haemangioma and lipoma, a usually harmless but disfiguring condition

Daddy's girl: The toddler's condition can almost be concealed in clothes, with just a slightly enlarged hand a tell-tale sign. But when her clothes are removed, the full extent of the growth of the tumours is clearly visible

Although a Communist country, China does not have a cradle-to-grave free-at-the-point of use healthcare system.

Instead around half of the population buy basic medical insurance which covers for half the costs of their healthcare. The remainder is paid either by patients or their health insurer. 

However, this leaves the poorest in China struggling to meet medical bills for serious condition like Xinlei’s.
