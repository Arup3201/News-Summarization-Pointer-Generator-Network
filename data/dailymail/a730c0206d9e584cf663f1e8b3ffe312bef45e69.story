Adrian Peterson has six children by six different mothers, he was the subject of a lengthy police investigation for sexual battery after a booze-fueled sex party that he invited his underage brother to, and his charity has claimed it gave out tens of thousands of dollars to nonprofit organizations that say they never saw a dime, according to a shocking new report.

After a lengthy police investigation, Peterson was never charged. The star has also never been accused of wrongdoing with respect to his charity.  

Before his arrest for child abuse, the Minnesota Vikings running back was one of the NFL's most bankable stars. He combined a record-setting talent on the field with a 'good guy' image off the field and racked up millions of dollars in sponsorships from the likes of General Mills and Nike.

But now, a shocking report by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune claims that his behavior wasn't nearly as squeaky clean has he let on.

Peterson was arrested on September 12 on felony child abuse charges in his Texas hometown after he allegedly whipped his four-year-old son so badly that he left wounds on the boy's legs, buttocks and genitals.

The Vikings, after sponsors began to pull out, agreed to drop Peterson from the team until the case is wrapped up in the courts. Peterson is on a six-year, $86million contract and was by far the biggest star on the team. 

Peterson has admitted to hitting the child but said he  was only giving out the same punishment he received himself.

Before September, 29-year-old Peterson had several run-ins with police, including a 2011 incident at a luxury hotel in which he was accused of rape after a night of drinking of drinking, partying and sex that involved four women, according to the Star-Tribune.

According to a police report viewed by the newspaper, Peterson brought his teenage brother and another family member, Chris Brown, along for the party. Brown said he paid for the hotel room with a credit card from Peterson's All Day Inc. charity.

At one point in the evening, according to police, one of the four women walked in on Peterson having sex with another woman and started fighting with him, telling Peterson that she was 'emotionally attached' to him.

Peterson responded by telling her that he's engaged to someone else and expecting a baby.

After one of the women accused Peterson of sexual assault, police launched a months-long investigation that resulted in a 39-page report. Ultimately, prosecutors decided that no crime had been committed, according to the Star-Tribune. 

Peterson's lawyer has previously said that the NFL star did nothing wrong.

Peterson projected a strong family image before his arrest. His father is a convicted felony who was in prison by the time he went to college on a football scholarship, but he has repeatedly talk about his relationship with his mother Bonita Brown. 

However, he's been quiet about the other part of his family life - his children, refusing even to say publicly how many he has. The Star-Tribune reports that Peterson had six children with six different women who live in three states - Minnesota, Georgia and Texas. 

In October 2013, his two-year-old son died in South Dakota after being beaten to death by the mother's boyfriend. 

Peterson had cultivated a public image with his All Day Inc. charity that aims to help at-risk children. Last year, he took a load of children to Dick's Sporting Goods and spent more than $100 each to buy them clothes and sports equipment. 

However, the Star-Tribune reports that Peterson's charity has made questionable donations in recent years. In 2011, records show that the charity had $247,000 in revenue but sent out money to just three charities. The charity reported to the IRS that it gave $70,000 to a Maryland nonprofit - though the director of that group said it had never gotten a cent from Peterson's group, according to the newspaper. 

At a second charity, the North Texas Food Bank, the director said she had never even heard of Peterson - much less receiving money from him. This, however, appears to be a bookkeeping error because the East Texas Food Bank said it had gotten donations from the NFL star.
