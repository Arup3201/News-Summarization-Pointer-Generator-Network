As he watched President Obama deliver his sixth State of the Union address, Dr Ben Carson reportedly called him 'a psychopath'.

The 63-year-old neurosurgeon - who is believed to be preparing for a Republican presidential nomination next year - allegedly made the comments while watching the address with his chief advisor Armstrong Williams.

Williams had remarked that Obama looked 'elegant' on the night.

To which Carson replied: 'Like most psychopaths. That's why they're successful. That's the way they look. They all look great.'

Carson's comments were reported by GQ in an article which added that 'casually branding the president a psychopath is exactly the sort of talk that strikes a chord—and just the thing that has made Carson a sensation in the GOP.'

Later in the conversation, Carson had apparently exclaimed that Obama sold Americans 'a lie'.

He reportedly said: 'He's trying to sell what he thinks is not true! He's sitting there saying, 'These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything.''

And it's not the first time Carson has courted controversy with his critical comments of the president since he entered politics two years ago.

He has previously said that Obamacare is 'the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery'.

Earlier this month, he argued that homosexuality is a choice because some people enter prison straight and leave gay. 

And last month, Carson told the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C. that the Democrats now see African-Americans' support as an entitlement and choose to 'keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.' 

Born in inner-city Detroit, Carson overcame his circumstances to become a surgeon. 

He became famous as the first surgeon to successfully separate conjoined twins joined at the head. 

In recent years, his focus has been on politics - and he is known for being an outspoken conservative Republican.
