Ronny Deila has warned Cardiff City it will take an inflated fee for them to have any chance of prising Anthony Stokes away from Celtic in January.

Sportsmail revealed this week that the Championship club were weighing up a £1.5million offer for the Republic of Ireland forward.

Deila, however, has made it clear he has no wish to part with Stokes, who has contributed seven goals this term despite operating mainly on the left flank.

The Parkhead manager believes the 26-year-old can further improve his physical condition but insisted he has been impressed by his mentality – an aspect of his character the former Hibs player has faced criticism over in the past.

‘We want to build the best team we can for Celtic and I think the January transfer window will see us strengthen rather than weaken,’ said Deila as he prepared for tonight’s Europa League tie against Dinamo Zagreb.

‘We will see what possibilities there are. We always look at the players and think of what is the best for the future for the club and the right way to go.

‘Nobody is for sale - but then everyone is for sale as well! If someone comes in with money where we can’t say no, then of course we must think about it. But they are all very expensive.

‘I think Anthony is happy and I’ve been talking to him a lot. I’m not afraid. He’s under contract and I’m in control of the situation.’

Stokes signed a new three-year deal in October of last year and Deila views his adaptability as an asset.

The 26-year-old striker has scored seven goals so far this season for the Glasgow club

‘Anthony has played well on the left but he is not there yet,’ he said. ‘He needs to improve physically so he can run even more and he can get even sharper.

‘He is an important player because he is scoring goals and he is a very intelligent player. He knows how to play and he can also link up well with the other players.

‘He needs to get his fitness up for the highest level but his attitude is very good.’

Stokes joined Celtic as a central striker in 2010 and has netted 75 times for the club. Deila isn’t ruling out a return to that preferred role in the future.

‘I think it is possible,’ said the Norwegian. ‘He has to show himself positively in the games and the training.

‘When he does play as a striker he goes out to the left all of the time. So I don’t think it is that different - and he enjoys playing on the left. He has also played some very good games there.

‘He has the talent but he has to keep working the way he has been and then he will get better every day.’

John Guidetti has been Celtic’s main goal threat this term but his ineligibility in Europe means £2m signing Stefan Scepovic could be given a chance to convince in Croatia this evening.

Captain Scott Brown has been left at home as he is one booking away from a European ban. James Forrest is being rested following his recent return to action, while injured trio Jason Denayer, Charlie Mulgrew and Mikael Lustig also miss out.

Celtic are guaranteed to finish second in Group D but there is approximately £160,000 up for grabs in prize money this evening. Victory would take their total Europa League earnings from UEFA to almost £2m.

It would also bolster the club’s co-efficient, which impacts upon the seedings for next season’s Champions League qualifiers.

‘It is an important game ahead of the next round and also for getting seeded next year,’ insisted Deila.

‘These are all important things we have to think of. It is also important to use this game to make the team even better in European games away from home. We want to get a victory because we know that would be a very good achievement.

‘Some players have not travelled but when people get their chance it is up to them to take it. It is up to the players coming in to say: “Ronny, I want to play.”

‘There is also prize money from this game and this is good. It would be a positive even though we know it won’t be huge.

‘We will go to a training camp soon (in Gran Canaria next month) as we want to improve and all the money that comes in can help us improve as a unit.’

Dinamo Zagreb boss Zoran Mamic also dismissed talk of tonight’s clash being meaningless and insisted his players must leave everything on the field.

Mamic is demanding maximum commitment from Dinamo after a disappointing European campaign that has yielded just three points from five Group D games.

‘I do not agree there is no imperative to win,’ he said. ‘We can’t qualify but all other motives are there. We should be prepared to die to win.

‘I will play my strongest possible team. We will look at the game and play to win.

‘It doesn’t matter if Celtic make changes. Players who are at Celtic certainly do not lack talent. Whoever comes in, it will not be easy.

‘We want to win this last European game. It improves our image and it carries prestige. It would also give us coefficient points and money.’
