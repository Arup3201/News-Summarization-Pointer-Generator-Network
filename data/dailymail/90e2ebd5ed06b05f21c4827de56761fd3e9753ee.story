Speculation: England new-boys Luke Shaw (above) and Adam Lallana could leave St Mary's for pastures new

Pochettino's Southampton future had been
 in doubt since the January departure of divisive executive chairman 
Nicola Cortese, having last summer claimed he would follow the Italian 
out of the club should he leave.

The former
 defender did stay on at Saints after Cortese exited but only for a 
matter of months, with the club concluding negotiations with Spurs on 
Tuesday after accepting his resignation.

Malky
 Mackay, Steve McClaren, Murat Yakin and Michael Laudrup are amongst the
 early frontrunners to replace Pochettino, while the departure will see 
speculation intensify over the future of Southampton's players.

Highly-rated
 teenager Luke Shaw and playmaker Adam Lallana have attracted interest 
from Manchester United and Liverpool respectively, while Dejan Lovren, 
Calum Chambers and Jay Rodriguez have also been linked with a move away.

Last
 month executive director Les Reed said the club's intention was to keep
 their star players but Pochettino's exit will make that harder, while 
also heaping the pressure on the recently-formed board, headed by 
chairman Ralph Krueger, to make a statement.

Nurturing talent :Pochettino brought several youngsters through at St Mary's

Chairman Ralph Kruger has thanked Pochettino for his contribution at the club, where he guided his inherited newly-promoted them to an eighth place finish in the Premier League this season.

'The Club has been on a constant path of growth since the arrival of Markus Liebherr in 2009,' he said on the official club website. 'This growth took place before Mauricio came, it continued strongly under his leadership, and it will continue into the next season. The Board’s job is to find opportunity in this challenge and to continue to move the Club forward.'

'We have begun the search for a new high-calibre manager. We will be looking for a manager that shares our values, our principles and our philosophy; a manager who can continue to grow the First Team and build on our strong foundation – a foundation led by an ambitious vision and plan that continues to build on our world-class academy, our amazing 129-year heritage and our excellent staff, and rewards our loyal and passionate fan base.'
