Two University of New Mexico footballers accused of raping a girl in a moving car have been cleared of all charges, it is claimed.

Footballers Crusoe
 Gongbay, 20, and SaQwan Edwards, 21, along with former student Ryan Ruff, were arrested in April on suspicion of kidnapping and raping the female student in a BMW.

But just two months later, the District Attorney's Office has reportedly dismissed the charges against the trio as it does not have enough evidence to indict them.

The charges for running back Gongbay 
and Ruff were dropped yesterday, while the charges for the UNM Lobo's 
cornerback Edwards will reportedly be dismissed later this week, 
according to KRQE News 13.

However, as authorities are continuing to investigate the case, the situation could yet change.

It comes as the trio's lawyers have claimed the alleged victim's story is riddled with holes and the case should be dropped altogether.

'The story that was given by the individual was not truthful. Itâ€™s that simple,' said Gongbay's attorney, Robert Cooper.

Meanwhile,
 Ruff's lawyer, George Anthony Bleus, said he would rather the case went
 to trial than be dragged out, saying: 'There will always be those citizens
 out there that will say, did they do this?'

The
 female student contacted campus police at around 3am on April 13 saying
 she had been raped by the three men, according to a criminal complaint 
cited by Reuters.

She
 claimed Gongbay, Edwards and Ruff had spotted her outside a house 
party, before Ruff 'put his arms around [her] and stated, "No, she is 
coming with us"'.

The group 
then allegedly drove off together and the two footballers took turns 
raping the girl, before Ruff took her to the university campus, where he
reportedly held her at gunpoint and raped her.

Gongbay
 and Ruff were arrested, followed by Edwards several days later, and the
 footballers were swiftly suspended from the UNM's team.

Gongbay, a junior at the university, and Ruff were charged with two counts 
of second-degree criminal sexual penetration, one count of kidnapping 
and one count of conspiracy, police said at the time.

Meanwhile, Edwards, a senior, was accused of two counts of sexual assault and kidnapping, according to Lieutenant Tim Stump of the University of New Mexico Police Department.

Gongbay, who is 6ft, 205lbs and comes from from Rockville, Maryland, was recruited to UNM by former coach Mike Locksley in 2011.

After
 leading the Lobos in rushing that season, Gongbay intended to follow 
Locksley to Maryland but his plans fell through so he asked the new 
coach, Bob Davie, if he could return to UNM.

Mr Davie
 said he was impressed by Gongbay's good academic standing and knew his 
teammates liked him so welcomed him back in August 2012. He has played 
effectively as a backup running back the past two seasons.

In a 
statement in April, Davie said he was aware of the allegations and due to 
the serious nature of the charges he had had suspended the junior 
indefinitely.

'Once this process is complete and all the details have emerged, we will handle the outcome appropriately,' Davie added.

It is unclear whether Gongbay and Edwards will now be allowed to rejoin the UNM's team.
