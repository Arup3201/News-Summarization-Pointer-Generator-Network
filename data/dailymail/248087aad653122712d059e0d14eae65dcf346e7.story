David Cameron's promise of a referendum on whether Britain should cut all ties with Brussels has reversed the flood of Tory voters switching to UKIP.

And pressure on Labour leader Ed Miliband to follow suit is set to grow after calls for him to back a nationwide vote on the issue won big support in a Mail on Sunday poll.

The survey suggests the Prime Minister’s EU referendum vow  has prompted a Tory bounce, with Labour’s lead cut by two points to seven per cent.

According to the Survation poll for this newspaper, Labour has a clear lead on 38 per cent, followed by the Tories on 31, UKIP on 14 and the Lib Dems on a lowly ten.

The two-point gain for the Conservatives since the New Year appears to have come directly from UKIP, who are down by two.

And the Conservatives received another boost today after UKIP leader Nigel Farage announced he now aims to target pro-EU Mr Miliband instead of Mr Cameron.

Mr Farage denounced the Labour leader’s ‘abject’ refusal to back a nationwide in/out ballot on the EU and said he was now ‘gunning for Labour’.

It is a marked change in tone from Mr Farage, whose sustained and  vitriolic attacks on ‘that man’ Mr Cameron in the past year have seen Tory defectors take UKIP’s ratings to record levels.

If Mr Cameron delivers his promise of negotiating big concessions,  it could help his avowed aim of  persuading voters to stay in the EU

In a separate move, former Labour Prime 
Minister Tony Blair today uses a Mail on Sunday article to urge 
pro-Europeans to rally behind the campaign for an ‘in’ vote – and offers
to help to mobilise supporters.

‘At present the EU is the most powerful political union and biggest business market in the world,’ he writes. ‘We will need it to remain at the top and we will need to be part  of it. For the UK to leave the bloc right on its doorstep would be an extraordinary denial of its own interests... I believe there is a sensible, solid majority in the UK for us to stay in Europe. It is time to start mobilising it.’

Mr Farage, also writing in this newspaper, said he planned to cash in on Labour’s split over the referendum. ‘David Cameron wants to renegotiate our relationship with Europe, followed by an opportunity to vote “out” if he is elected after 2015,’  he writes.

Ed Miliband exposed an 'open flank' according to UKIP leader Nigel farage

‘Here was an open goal for the Labour Party to demand that referendum now. They could have called his bluff. Ed Miliband could have pressed the Prime Minister to give voters a say on Europe without ifs and buts. Yet they didn’t. As a party, we not only see this as a political failure on Labour’s part, but a betrayal.’

In a move which will be interpreted as a tacit ‘pact’ with the Conservatives, Mr Farage is planning to concentrate Election campaign resources on Labour-held councils and Commons constituencies.

A spring advertising offensive by UKIP will highlight Mr Miliband’s opposition to a referendum and blame Labour for failing to stem  the  expected wave of fresh  immigration from Bulgaria and Romania when restrictions are relaxed in December.

‘Miliband has exposed an open flank,’ Mr Farage says. ‘We are going for the Labour Party’s jugular .  .  . UKIP is now a serious player in British politics and we are not going to go away.

‘We represent not just disgruntled, disenchanted Conservatives but everyone in Britain affected by the loss of sovereignty that comes with being a member of the EU.’

The Survation figures help explain Mr Farage’s decision to chase votes from Labour supporters disillusioned with Mr Miliband’s anti-EU referendum stance. A majority say Mr Cameron’s Europe speech last week was ‘statesmanlike’.

If the referendum was held today, Britons would vote by 50 per cent to 36 in favour of leaving the EU.

The top three powers that voters  want back from Brussels are immigration, farming hand-outs and employment laws.

If Mr Cameron delivers his promise of negotiating big concessions,  it could help his avowed aim of  persuading voters to stay in the EU. Of those who currently want to leave, more than two out of five say it would make them reconsider.

Voters think Britain would be less of a world power outside the EU, but they are swayed by the belief that they would be richer. A total of 41 per cent say we would be better off economically if we leave, against 26 who say we will be worse off.

More than one in three say we would lose diplomatic clout, compared with one in five who say we would have more.

But while Mr Cameron’s EU referendum policy gets a thumbs-up, there is widespread scepticism about his motives – and whether he will match his words with deeds. Four out of ten say they do not trust him to deliver a referendum, against three out of ten who do.

An overwhelming 62 per cent say the referendum vow is to stop a Tory split and undermine UKIP. Just 26 per cent say the Prime Minister acted out of principle.

Worringly for Mr Miliband, demands by Eurosceptic Labour MPs for him to match Mr Cameron’s referendum offer are supported by 45 per cent. But a Miliband  U-turn would pose risks: the survey emphasises Labour supporters are as overwhelmingly pro-EU as the Tories are overwhelmingly anti-EU.
