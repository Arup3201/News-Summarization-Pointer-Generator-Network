A dog who spent 11 years in a rescue centre because no-one wanted to adopt him has been put down after falling ill.

Toby the collie arrived at Hilbrae Pets Hotel as a ten-month old stray in May 2003.

But while it was initially hoped the loving dog would quickly find a family, his fear of cars made finding a permanent home almost impossible, staff said.

After the centre stepped up the search for a home - including regular updates from his own Twitter account  - a number of prospective owners came forward.

But still no home was found and Toby remained at the centre near Telford, Shropshire, until this week when he became unwell. 

The affectionate collie was put to sleep after a visit to the vets yesterday.

Claudia Churchill, a supervisor at Hilbrae Pets Hotel for 22 years, had the sad job of taking Toby on his last trip.

She said: 'He lost his appetite, became incontinent and was very sleepy. Everything seemed to be packing up so we took him to the vet.

'Normally he would fight to avoid getting into the van, but he just got in without trouble. It is as if he knew it was time.

'When we got to the vet he was examined and it was decided he would be put to sleep. He was in my arms when they did it and it was a very tearful moment.

'Everyone is heartbroken, it is so sad.'

Toby's Twitter account - @HilbraeToby - had picked up almost 4,000 followers and his death was announced on the social network, leaving his followers saddened at the news.

Julianna Kaminski, from the centre, tweeted: 'Old age had caught up with him, he had lost interest in all the things he enjoyed, his food, chasing toys in the field, going for walks as well as other problems.

'We don't know exactly how old he was but he had been here many years and we are all very sad.

'Run free @HilbraeToby, no more things to frighten you any more.'

One person tweeted: 'Oh bless him. Very sad, wish there had been a happier ending. #RIPToby'.
