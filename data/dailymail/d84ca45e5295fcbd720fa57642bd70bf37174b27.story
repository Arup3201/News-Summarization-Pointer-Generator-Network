The leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has been created a cardinal by Pope Francis.

The Most Rev Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, received the symbolic red hat at a consistory ceremony in Rome.

The Archbishop was one of 19 cardinals created during the ceremony this morning at St Peter's Basilica.

A Papal Mass with the new cardinals - all elevated to the Catholic clergy's second highest rank - will take place tomorrow.

It means they will be granted a place at the conclave which will be consulted to elect the next Pope.

Archbishop
 Nichols, the 11th Archbishop of Westminster to receive the honour, said
 when it was announced last month that he was 'deeply moved' by it.

He
 added: 'The Catholic Church in our countries has always had a profound 
and loving loyalty to the Holy Father, the Successor of St Peter. 

The Archbishop speaks with the Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI during a consistory

Former Pope Benedict made his first attendance at a papal ceremony since his resignation last year

'This appointment enables me, on behalf of all, to serve the pope in a direct and prolonged way.

'Personally,
 this is a humbling moment when I am asked to take a place in this 
service of the Holy See and in the line of much-loved Cardinal 
Archbishops of Westminster.

'I
 seek the blessing of Almighty God for these new responsibilities and I 
ask for the prayers of all people of faith that I may fulfil them with 
energy and devotion.'

Born 
in Crosby, Liverpool, in November 1945, Archbishop Nichols studied for 
the priesthood at the Venerable English College in Rome from 1963 to 
1970, gaining licences in philosophy and theology at the Gregorian 
University.

He was ordained as a priest in Rome in 1969 before taking a MA degree in theology at Manchester University.

In
 1984 he was appointed general secretary of the Bishops' Conference in 
England and Wales and was named Archbishop of Birmingham in 2000 before 
returning to Westminster in 2009 as Archbishop, the same year he was 
unanimously elected president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of 
England and Wales.

Delivering
 the Thought for the Day on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Archbishop 
Nichols said just four of the 15 new cardinals were from European 
countries and the Pope was 'broadening the perspectives' of those who 
advise him.

He added: 'Some are drawn from places of real poverty: Burkina Faso, Haiti and the Philippines.

'The voice of those who live among and care for the poor is a voice Pope Francis wants to hear in his counsels.

Archbishop Nichols, the 11th Archbishop of Westminster to receive the honour, said when it was announced last month that he was 'deeply moved' by it.

'He
 also wants around him those whose role is to lead communities of 
Catholic faith in the mega-cities of our world: Rio de Janeiro, Buenos 
Aires, Seoul and, in my case, London.

'These
 are among the great trading posts of the modern world, places where 
culture, beliefs and values mingle and clash, where enterprise 
flourishes, where great riches and abject poverty are side by side, 
where corruption and virtue vie for influence and space.'

Each bishop appointed cardinal promised fidelity to the death to the pope and received a red biretta and a ring from him.

The reason that the biretta is red is to symbolise the wearer's willingness to give their lives for the Catholic faith.

An
 ancient custom is that each cardinal will also be appointed titular 
bishop to a Roman church. This appointment reflects the original role of
 the College of Cardinals.

It is usual that following the ceremony, there are various receptions held in the Vatican.

These
 are often held on the first floor of the Apostolic Palace, but they 
have also been held in the Audience Hall and Vatican Museum.

The
 Archbishop courted controversy earlier this month when he branded the 
Coalition's welfare reforms as a "disgrace" which leave vulnerable 
people facing "hunger and destitution".

He said the Government had decimated even the most "basic safety net" for those threatened by poverty.

He
 told the Telegraph: "People do understand that we do need to tighten 
our belts and be much more responsible and careful in public 
expenditure.

'But I 
think what is happening is two things: one is that the basic safety net 
that was there to guarantee that people would not be left in hunger or 
in destitution has actually been torn apart.

'It no longer exists and that is a real, real dramatic crisis.

'And the second is that, in this context, the administration of social assistance, I am told, has become more and more punitive.

'So if applicants don't get it right then they have to wait for 10 days, for two weeks with nothing - with nothing.

'For a country of our affluence, that quite frankly is a disgrace.'
