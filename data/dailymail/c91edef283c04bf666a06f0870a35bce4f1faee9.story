A car was left crushed this morning after being involved in a collision with an aeroplane - on the runway.

The terrifying incident happened at King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia as the aircraft was taxiing to the hangar for routine maintenance.

One side of the patrol vehicle was completely obliterated underneath the turbine at around 3.15am local time.

The Saudi Arabian jet was empty of passengers, and the collision resulted in some damage to the right-hand side engine.

Aleqt.com reported that the driver of the car suffered minor injuries and was taken to hospital.

The investigations branch of the Aviation Accidents organisation are looking into how and why the crash happened.

Collisions involving planes usually occur on maintenance trips for aircraft.

The damage was extensive after a plane crashed into a patrol car during a routine maintenance check

In January this year a British Airways plane hit a hangar at Heathrow Airport, while being towed away for routine maintenance.

As the Boeing 777-200 aircraft was being towed towards a hangar, someone misjudged the distance and the plane's wing clipped the wall of a nearby building.

There were no injuries from the collision, and the airport and airline continued to operate normally for the rest of the day.
