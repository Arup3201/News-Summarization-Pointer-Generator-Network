Fitch has slashed the credit ratings for a handful of major banks in the U.S. and Europe, sparking fears over the outlook for the world economy.

The mass downgrade heightened concerns of a new credit crunch as the global banking system struggles with massive levels of debt.

The ratings firm said it lowered the ratings for Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale.

It also downgraded its long-term 
issuer-default rating for Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Credit
 Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs.

Barclays' long-term rating was dropped
 two notches from an AAâ€“ rating to an A, while Bank of America, 
Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were downgraded from A+ to A.

Nevertheless, shares in London-listed 
Barclays - headed by American Bob Diamond - were unruffled by the news 
this morning, trading 0.9p up at 171.4p.

The wider market also took the downgrades in its stride, with the FTSE 100 index 28.7 points ahead at 5,429.6.

London shares were helped by positive 
sentiment in the U.S. and Asia overnight after a fall in U.S. 
unemployment, a stronger-than-expected rise in regional factory activity
 and better-than-forecast results from FedEx Corp.

'There's a growing sentiment that the 
European Central Bank is doing quite a good job and is ready to buy more
 bonds if needed, preventing stocks from a complete meltdown,' said 
David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities.

'But at the same time, we have this sword of Damocles of rating downgrades waiting to happen, so it's hard to go long.'

Standard & Poor's recently warned 
that it could next week downgrade some or all of the 15 eurozone 
countries it has on review.

World stocks rose this morning after improving U.S. jobs and manufacturing data and the expected approval in Italy of an austerity plan intended to get the country's finances under control.

Benchmark oil hovered near $94 per barrel while the dollar rose against the euro and the yen.

European shares rose in early trading, following gains in Asia. Britain's FTSE added 0.3 percent to 5,415.04.

Germany's DAX inched up 0.3 percent to 5,745.07. France's CAC-40 was steady at 2,997.89. Wall Street also appeared ready to head higher.

Dow Jones industrial futures rose 0.4 percent to 11,872 while S&P 500 futures gained 0.6 percent to 1,218.80.Japan's Nikkei 225 index was 0.3 percent higher to close at 8,401.72.

South Korea's Kospi rose 1.2 percent to 1,839.96 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 1.4 percent to 18,285.39. Benchmarks in Singapore, Taiwan and Indonesia also rose.

Mainland China shares ended a six-session losing streak, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index gaining 2 percent to close at 2,224.84.

Analysts stopped short of calling the gains a recovery, as trading was light ahead of the holidays.

It has emerged that British officials 
are to take part in 'technical discussions' on new arrangements to 
govern the eurozone economies, despite David Cameron blocking a new 
European Union treaty at last week's Brussels summit.

The move - agreed last night in a 
telephone call between Mr Cameron and the President of the European 
Council, Herman von Rompuy - is likely to be seen as an olive branch 
both to the other EU countries and his Liberal Democrat coalition 
partners.

'The Prime Minister reiterated that he
 wants the new fiscal agreement to succeed, and to find the right way 
forward that ensures the EU institutions fulfil their role as guardian 
of the EU treaty on issues such as the single market,' a No 10 spokesman
 said.

'That's why we have today agreed to participate in technical discussions to take forward this work.'

George Magnus, senior economic adviser
 at UBS, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'The one glimmer of light
 in the aftermath of the summit is really that the eurozone banks were 
facing an incredibly tight funding squeeze.

'They couldn't really raise or renew 
deposits in order to fund their loans and purchases of government bonds 
so there was a real danger at some point before the summit, or before 
the ECB meeting, that we could have had some kind of banking disaster.

'I think that really has been negated 
at least for the time being. At least we've bought some time - I think 
that's what the ECB has really done.

'I think from a financial markets 
point of view, people are very sceptical about whether (the summit) has 
any real value or content at all, except perhaps to deal with the next 
eurozone crisis, provided they can get through this one - which is quite
 doubtful.'
