The family of a Massachusetts firefighter escaped a massive house fire early Wednesday morning. The five-member family's safety isn't thanks to the experienced fireman, though, but to his six-year-old daughter. 

Six-year-old Victoria Pierro was woken up just after 4.30am, police say, when a fan in her room lost power. The kindergartner smelled smoke, saw fire, then rushed to alert her parents, CBS Boston reports.  

'She was outstanding,' Kevin Breen, Swampscott fire chief, told the Boston Herald about the kindergartner. 'She did everything we talk about. She kept her head. She didn’t go hide.'

FOX reports that Victoria's mother was in the living room of their Swampscott home when the little girl came to alert her.

Lori Pierro grabbed her daughter and yelled 'Fire! Fire! Fire!' before running up the stairs to wake her husband Anthony and sons Nicholas, 15, and Christian, 12. 

The flames quickly tore through the roof of the two-story home, but thanks to the little girl, the family managed to escape through a rear door with just seconds to spare, according to CBS.

The family reportedly had an evacuation plan in place that helped them to escape the fire, but that would have been useless had the six-year-old not jumped to action.

Anthony's fellow firefighters arrived just moments later and CBS reports that it took the responders nearly an hour to bring the flames under control. The fire destroyed the family's home, car, newly-bought Christmas presents, and other possessions.

The family and fire chief credit the family's safety to little Victoria, and Lori said she doesn't know what the fate of her family would have been if her daughter didn't know what to do. 

Sleeping: Victoria's fireman father, Anthony, and her two brothers slept as the flames broke out. It was Victoria's quick action that led the family to escaping the blaze with only seconds to spare

Loss: The fire destroyed the family's home, car, newly-bought Christmas presents, and other possessions

Accidental: Investigators say the fire started in the family's garage and is believed to have been accidental

Anthony has been a firefighter for 12 years and praised his daughter's heroism, the Boston Globe reports. 

'We feel badly for [Anthony's] loss,' Breen told the Globe, 'but for someone who’s trained to say that he got out with 30 seconds to spare is pretty scary,'

Investigators say the fire started in the garage and is believed to have been accidental. 

The Globe reports that the family has been staying with a neighbor, and many have brought clothes and other donations to the family. The Swampscott Fire Department has even set up a donation fund to help the family.
