Taking pride of place amongst the entrants to this year's Turnip Prize is a large car spring, cloaked in a tea towel and donning a pair of sunglasses.

The whacky piece, entitled Arab Spring, tells you everything you need to know about the competition - an annual celebration of 'crap art'.

The tongue-in-cheek competition is derived from Britain's leading art competition the Turner Prize - and it is safe to say that it doesn't take itself quite as seriously.

The Arab Spring: Constructed from a car spring, a tea towel and a pair of sunglasses this piece encapsulates the Turnip Prize, held in the New Inn pub in Wedmore, Somerset

Stone He Broke: This pun on the British slang phrase Stony Broke is typical of the witty entries to the competition

Bread in Captivity: James Standen's hilarious, if not unsophisticated, piece is one of the entrants in the 14th Turner Prize. Winners receive a turnip nailed to plank of wood

The shortlist for this year's satirical competition has just been announced and the lineup is every way as ridiculous as could be expected.

Bread in Captivity, created by James Standen, features a lonely bread roll peering out from behind the bars of a pet carrier.

Former Turnip Prize winners

2005 - Ian Osenthroat, Bird’s Flew - An empty bird nest containing a flu remedy

2006 - Ian Lewis, Torn Beef - An empty Corned Beef can

2007 - Bracy Vermin, Tea P - Used Tea bags in the shape of a P

2008 - Ivor Prance, Fleeced - A piece of sheep's wool depicting John Sargeant

2009 - Frank Van Bough, Manhole Cover - A pair of large white Y fronts

2010 – Doug Pitt, Chilli n’Minors - One large chilli and three smaller chilli’s

Next on the pun-heavy list is the entry Children in Knead - a ball of dough on a plate with miniature children stuck into it.

The competition, now in its 14th year, is held in the New Inn pub in Wedmore, Somerset after being devised by regulars.

Entrants are awarded extra marks for a 'lack of effort' and 'using alliteration or a pun in the title'.

Conversely, entrants risk disqualification for putting in 'too much effort'.

The winner of the genuine competition, the Turner Prize, will be announced on December 3 on a live television broadcast on Channel 4.

While the artist who takes away the accolade will win a £25,000 prize, along with years of 
prestige, winners of the spinoff competition are presented with a turnip
 stuck on a six-inch rusty nail.

Entries to the two competitions can best be described as from different ends of the artistic spectrum.

The Three Tenas: The competition's organiser Trevor Prideaux said they needed another skip to deal with the number of entries

Martin Boyce won last year's Turner 
Prize with his installation piece Do Words Have Voices - an abstract work recalling a melancholy park bench, featuring metallic trees and 
scattered, paper leaves.

In comparison, 103-year-old Jim Drew 
beat 83 competitors to come out on top of last year's Turnip Prize after
 entering a jar of muddy water - his take on the famous blues artist.

Mr Drew will be on hand to judge this year's entrants.

Trevor Prideaux, who organises the 
event, said: 'We did think the novelty might have worn off by now but I 
think we need an extra skip for entries this year, we have had a huge 
response from people all over the country.

'There’s an awful lot of dross, but 
some very topical entries. We have occasionally sold the winning entry. 
There is a student in London who has bought them.

'He must be waiting for them to appreciate in value. We have donated the money to a worth cause.'
