A 10-year-old boy has died after an SUV crashed into the back of his Mennonite family's horse-drawn carriage in a small community in northwest Missouri.

But the victim's family have forgiven the female driver that hit the two-wheel cart, saying she was 'merely a tool in the hands of God'.

The State Highway Patrol said the crash happened Thursday morning near Wheeling, about 90 miles northeast of Kansas City.

The agency says Joshua Leinbach was killed in the accident, while his two younger sisters were thrown from the buggy. 

Driver: Penny Anderson says she was blinded by sinlight and did not see the small cart carrying the children to school in Wheeling, Missouri, but the victims' family told her they don't blame her

Buggy: Horse-drawn carts are common in the area, where this a small Mennonite community of about 20 families. They have to share the road with regular vehicles, however 

Crash: Seen here is the damage caused to Penny Anderson's car in the accident which killed 10-year-old Joshua Leinbach 

The children were on their way to school. 

The patrol said seven-year-old Amanda Leinbach suffered serious injuries, while eight-year-old Katelyn's injuries were minor. 

The family lives in Wheeling.

The SUV driver, Penny Anderson, also suffered minor injuries. 

The 44-year-old told KMBC-TV that she'd been temporarily blinded by the morning sun before hitting the buggy.

'They were just in a tiny little two-wheel cart,' she said.

'I never saw them. I never saw them.'

Support: Friends of the victims' family are seen visiting their home following the accident on Thursday

Anderson added: 'I feel like I have done the most horrible thing a person could ever do and I didn't even mean to. It was an accident.'

Anderson was taken to hospital for some minor injuries.

The children's family visited her that night.

They went to tell her they do blame her for what happened, and will not press charges over the wreck.

'They looked right at me and said, ''We don't blame you for what happened'',' Anderson said.

A member of the boy's family told KMBC: 'It is heartbreaking, but we rest in the shelter of God's arms.'
