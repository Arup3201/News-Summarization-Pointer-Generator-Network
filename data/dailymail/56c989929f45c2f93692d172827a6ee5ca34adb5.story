ISIS has threatened Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and his employees after the site removed accounts linked to the extremists.

Twitter confirmed to Daily Mail Online that the company was working with authorities to verify the seriousness of the threat which claimed employees' necks are 'a target for the soldiers of the Caliphate'.

The chilling warning, written in Arabic, featured a picture of Dorsey in a gun's cross-hairs and the Twitter logo. It was posted on Sunday on an anonymous site based in Poland which is used by programmers to share code.

Dorsey, who is worth an estimated $2.5billion and lives in California, made no mention of the threat online on Sunday as he tweeted his 2.87million followers.

The alleged threat,  first reported by Buzzfeed, mentioned Dorsey and included the words: 'We always come back.'

In a statement to Daily Mail Online, a Twitter spokesperson said on Monday: 'Our security team is investigating the veracity of these threats with relevant law enforcement officials.'

When entered into Google translate (which does not provide an exact translation) the message is titled: 'Tweets in response to a campaign to delete accounts.'

It goes on: 'You started this failed war'. The message then appears to address Dorsey directly and Twitter employees. 

It reads: 'Hey Jack... when their necks officially become a target for the soldiers of the Caliphate and supporters scattered among your midst!' 

It also claimed killing employees 'outside a neighborhood pub' would be no more preventable than the massacres of Charlie Hebdo killer Amedy Coulibaly and Copenhagen shooter Omar el-Hussein. 

The message later reads: 'Imagine the scene and wait for its occurrence at any moment, and the earliest opportunity!

'Virtual your war on us in the Internet will pull you real wars on earth!'

It closes with the threat: 'Is the message reached my Twitter?'  

ISIS have posted horrific videos and images of executions, including beheadings, on mainstream sites online.

According to Twitter's rules: 'You may not publish or post direct, specific threats of violence against others.'

Twitter and YouTube both removed violent material and propaganda linked to ISIS.  

California-based Dorsey made no mention of the Twitter threat as he tweeted his 2.87million followers on Sunday night
