Women who use the internet to seek boyfriends will win the right to force the police to reveal if they have a history of violence under plans being considered by Home Secretary Theresa May.

The controversial move is in response to fears that the growing phenomenon of internet dating means more and more women are going out with men whose backgrounds they know little about.

The proposal has been called ‘Clare’s Law’, after the horrific killing of 36-year-old mother Clare Wood by a man she met on Facebook. George Appleton strangled Ms Wood and set her body on fire before hanging himself.

Friends and family were shocked to discover that the killer had a history of violence against women, including repeated harassment, threats and the kidnapping at knifepoint of one of his other ex-girlfriends.

A Clare’s Law campaign is to be launched tomorrow. It is modelled on Sarah’s Law’, the successful fight to give parents the right to check on paedophiles in their area after the murder of schoolgirl  Sarah Payne.

In a letter seen by The Mail on Sunday, Mrs May indicates she is considering introducing Clare’s Law and will make an announcement in the next few weeks.

She says: ‘Tackling violence against women and girls is a priority for this Government.’

However, some believe the well-intentioned plan could jeopardise civil liberties.

Tory MP Robert Buckland, a member of the Commons Justice Committee, said: ‘We’re all in favour of curbing violence against women but we have to be certain this will not lead to fishing expeditions by women demanding confidential information about potential boyfriends without proper justification.

‘You cannot have a carte blanche 
system where people can simply turn up at a police station, give the 
name of a boyfriend or potential boyfriend, and expect the police to 
open up all the files on him. There will have to be strict controls on 
any proposal of this nature.’

Supporters of Clare’s Law insist that there would be safeguards to prevent any such abuse.

But Louise Casey, the Government’s 
victims’ commissioner, said: ‘Our priority should not be protecting a 
perpetrator’s privacy at the expense of costing a woman’s life.’

The Clare’s Law campaign is being led by former Labour Cabinet Minister Hazel Blears and Ms Wood’s father, Michael Brown.

Mr Brown, 67, a former prison officer,
 last night told The Mail on Sunday he would do ‘anything I can’ to get 
the proposals agreed, adding: ‘There needs to be greater protection.’

He also said: ‘My daughter wasn’t stupid. If she had known about that man’s past, she would have taken herself out of there in a heartbeat.’

Former Home Office Minister  Ms Blears, who was Ms Wood’s  MP, said the launch just a few weeks ago of a national police database made Clare’s Law checks simple to carry out.

The Salford MP said: ‘Women in Clare’s situation often are unaware of their partner’s previous relationships and this can mean they start a relationship with someone with no idea if they have a violent past. Until women are given the right to know if their partner has a history of serial domestic abuse, they can’t be sure of the risk that they face.

‘By changing the law we can empower women so that they can take informed action about their relationship and give them the chance to protect themselves.’

Ms Blears pointed out that a survey showed overwhelming backing for Clare’s Law, with 91 per cent of women consulted saying a person had the right to know if their partner had a recorded history of domestic violence.

The radical proposals are based on recommendations by Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Brian Moore, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers on violence against women.

The draft Clare’s Law scheme would 
include allowing women with concerns about their partners to apply to 
their local police station for information on any violent past. More 
controversially, police would proactively warn women that their partner 
was a potential danger.

Police
 sources stressed that information would be released only by police 
officers of inspector rank and above, and after they were fully 
satisfied someone’s concerns about their partner was genuine.

After the inquest into Ms Wood’s death, coroner Jennifer Leeming wrote to the Home Office to recommend a system of checks which has become the basis of Clare’s Law.

Ms Wood was initially charmed by Appleton’s persona after meeting him online, but his violent side soon surfaced and he subjected her to a string of sexual assaults.

After they split he strangled her and set on fire in Salford in February 2009. When he went on the run he was quickly dubbed the ‘Facebook Fugitive’.

Six days after Ms Wood’s body was found, Appleton was discovered hanged in a derelict pub.

Ms Wood had first called police in October 2008 after he damaged her front door, threatened her with an iron and threatened to kill her.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission later ruled she had been badly let down by police.

Last night, sources close to the Home Secretary said: ‘We’re looking into this although no final decision has yet been made.’

Sarah’s Law was rolled out last year to give parents the legal right to know if anyone with regular access to children posed a risk. It followed the murder of Sarah Payne by paedophile Roy Whiting in 2000.
