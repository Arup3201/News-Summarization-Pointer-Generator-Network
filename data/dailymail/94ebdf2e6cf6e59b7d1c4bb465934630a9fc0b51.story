After ditching his ambitions to be Mayor of New York City, Anthony Weiner appears to have swapped politics for pans.

The Democrat, who also resigned from Congress in 2011 over a sexting scandal, has been linked to a restaurant venture to help the city's unemployed.

He has been spotted apparently looking for locations for the Rockaway Restoration Kitchen, which is billing itself as a locally sourced eatery staffed by former addicts and prisoners.

Although the restaurant is still in the early stages of planning, it is expected to be based in Rockaway, Queens, which is considered a 'food desert' when it comes to healthy places to eat.

The area also has high unemployment, and suffered serious damage during Hurricane Sandy.

Weiner has not commented on his involvement with the project, but the Rockaway Times claims several people have said he has been looking for a suitable location for it.

After stepping down from the mayoral race last year, Weiner had said he planned to move out of politics.

In November Weiner, who describes himself as 'a fighter for those struggling to make it', appeared in the New York Post when he volunteered at a food kitchen.

The Rockaway Restoration Kitchen is an ambitious project to try to breathe life into a neglected neighborhood while giving a second chance to the unemployed.

The company's website states: 'Our goal is to provide a comfortable neighborhood restaurant with healthy, locally sourced food that satisfies the hunger of Rockaway residents, attracts visitors and serves up dignity and self-sufficiency by serving as a hands on training ground.'

The restaurant will work with social services to find suitable candidates for its training program, many of whom may have struggled to find work because of drug addiction or previous convictions.

Weiner has not yet responded to a MailOnline request for comment.
