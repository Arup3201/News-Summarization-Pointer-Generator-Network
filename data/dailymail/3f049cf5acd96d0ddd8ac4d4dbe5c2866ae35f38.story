A former Labor politician has sold yet another multi-million dollar investment property in one of Melbourne's expensive suburbs.

Entrepreneur Evan Thornley accepted an offer of about $10 million for his landmark Federation home in Kew, Melbourne's east.

Last September Thornley and his wife Tracey Ellery sold another renovated mansion at East Melbourne for $10.2 million, reported The Age.

Their recently sold stunning mansion, named Grange House,  sits opposite Reservoir Reserve and features six bedrooms, a gym, multiple formal and informal living rooms and a 25-metre lap pool.

The pair bought the home in 2007 for $6.6 million and the property underwent a major revamp with extensions into what used to be a tennis court.

The 2,653 square metres property, at 19 Grange Road, was sold on Monday by Kay & Burton Hawthorn - a day before expressions of interest closed for the lavish home.

It is believed that Grange House was sold to a Canadian buyer after being listed less than a month ago. The property was initially marketed for $8 million.
