Young women aged between 18 and 24 are going broke twice as fast as young men, it was revealed yesterday.

And experts say many women are building up debts they cannot repay to pursue a celebrity lifestyle.

They are buying designer clothes and other expensive goods as they try to emulate the rich and famous.

New figures from the Insolvency Service show how among the under 35s, women are more likely to go bust than men

Reality TV star Kerry Katona last year filed for bankruptcy for a second time in five years while Martine McCutcheon was also declared bankrupt last year

The scale of the financial problems facing women emerged yesterday in official figures on personal insolvency.

They
 highlight an extraordinary social change in Britain from a time when an
 insolvent woman in her 20s was a rarity to today’s debt explosion.

Aggressive advertising campaigns by payday loan companies which encourage women to spend on luxuries also came in for criticism.

The
 Insolvency Service’s figures show that last year 7.8 women aged 18 to 
24 became insolvent for every 10,000 adults compared with a rate of 4.0 
for men.

More women than men
 were also going bust in the 25-34 age group, although the difference 
was not so stark. The personal insolvency rate for women was 32.8 per 
10,000 adults last year, while for men it was 25.6.

The
 figures, for England and Wales, show that around 14,730 women aged 18 
and 34 were overwhelmed by their debts last year, compared with around 
10,950 men.

The gender gap is most striking in the South West, where almost 14 in 10,000 women aged under-25 are insolvent, compared to 5.5 for men

High profile 
young women who have been unable to pay their debts include former 
EastEnders actress Martine McCutcheon, declared bankrupt last year, and 
the singer Kerry Katona, who last year filed for bankruptcy for the 
second time in five years.

The
 figures also show that when all age groups are taken into account women
 are for the first time just as likely as men to become insolvent.

For
 every 10,000 adults 22.6 men became insolvent last year. For women, the
 figure was virtually identical at 22.2. In 2009, the insolvency rate 
for men was 35.5 per 10,000 adults, whereas for women it was 26.0.

Yesterday
 experts predicted women will ‘beat’ men of all ages within a few years,
 a dubious landmark for those whose grandmothers were not even allowed 
to take out a mortgage in their own right.

Louise
 Brittain, a council member for the insolvency professionals’ trade body
 R3s, said the larger numbers of young women going insolvent compared 
with men is in part likely to be a hangover from the pre-credit crunch 
era when people were making their incomes stretch further by taking out 
credit.

‘I think it is the 
differences in spending patterns nowadays for that age group,’ she said.
 ‘Lifestyles have changed a great deal in the last 20 years.’

She
 also suggested that celebrity culture may be having some influence on 
spending habits, with people trying to imitate a lifestyle few can 
actually afford.

Seaside struggle: Coastal areas suffer from higher insolvency rates, the new research suggests

Experts say changing lifestyle patterns and a hangover from the financial crisis mean young women are more willing - and able - to take on debts

The 10 local authorities with the highest personal insolvency rates across England and Wales in 2013, with the rate per 10,000 adults:

1. Torbay, 47.2

2. Denbighshire, 43.0

3. Blackpool, 40.8

4. Scarborough, 40.6

5. Mansfield, 40.4

6. Halton, 40.2

7. South Kesteven, 39.8

8. Hull, 39.6

9. Stoke-on-Trent, 39.5

10. Cannock Chase, 39.3

David 
Rodger, chief executive of the Debt Advice Foundation, said: ‘The credit
 landscape is changing rapidly, with marketers becoming a lot more 
targeted and using mobile, social media and online advertising to 
promote borrowing and spending. Payday and other short-term lenders are 
working hard to look more responsible.’

He
 said the rise in female insolvency is ‘the inevitable outcome of the 
expansion of credit marketing’, adding: ‘Taking out credit is now 
perceived as a right, with the responsibilities pushed to one side.’

Personal
 insolvencies are made up of bankruptcies, debt relief orders and 
individual voluntary arrangements, where money is shared out between 
creditors.

Many go for IVAs, which were established in 1986 as an alternative for individuals wishing to avoid bankruptcy.

They
 are a formal repayment proposal presented to a debtor’s creditors via 
an insolvency practitioner and are seen by many as an option that does 
not attract the same stigma as a bankruptcy hearing.

The
 increase in female insolvency has also been fuelled by the introduction
 of debt relief orders in 2009. They are only an option for people who 
have debts of less than £15,000, who have almost no assets, who cannot 
pay their debts and who have no prospect of their situation improving.
