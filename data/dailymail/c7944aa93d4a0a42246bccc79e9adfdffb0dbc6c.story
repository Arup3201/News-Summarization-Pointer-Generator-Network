All-rounder Chris Jordan may be a nippy seamer, hard-hitting No 8 and slip fielder, but he is also theembodiment of England’s future and an oblique reminder of their past.

Jordan, who is set to win his first Test cap for England against Sri Lanka at Lord’s on Thursday, was born in Barbados in 1988 — the summer in which two of his heroes, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, took 34 wickets as West Indies beat England 4-0.

Now, the player, who was welcomed to English cricket when he won a scholarship at Dulwich College in 2006, will be given the chance to dish out Caribbean-style chin music against batsmen reared on the soporific pitches of Asia.

Debut: Chris Jordan is set to earn his first Test cap for England against Sri Lanka at Lord's on Thursday

Unmoved: Jordan says the 'bit of chat' between cricketers on the pitch 'doesn't faze' him

On the two paciest pitches in the recent one-day series, which Sri Lanka won 3-2, Jordan claimed 3-25 at The Oval and 5-29 at Old Trafford.

England won both games and Jordan is more than happy to repeat the dose in the two-Test series at Lord’s and Headingley.

‘If the bounce is there to exploit, we’ll try to do so,’ he said. ‘It’s something we’ve spoken about, and it worked quite well.’

Jordan’s performance at The Oval, where he tested out Sri Lanka’s lower order in particular, earned him an earful in the next game at Chester-le-Street, where England were skittled for 99.

‘As I came out to bat, I got surrounded and there was a bit of chat,’ he said. ‘But that stuff doesn’t faze me.’

Aged just 25, Jordan already has a self sufficient streak that bodes well. As a youngster watching West Indies play at Bridgetown’s Kensington Oval, he would provide throwdowns after stumps for Brian Lara.

And when Bill Athey, the former England opener who lured him to Dulwich, came calling, the teenage Jordan’s response was to look up the school on the web to see what lay in store. He was impressed.

‘I was always ambitious and open-minded,’ he said. ‘I relished the opportunity to further my game.’ Sussex signed him ahead of the 2013 season, and he has never looked back as he set about reaching a series of targets.

‘I want to develop my fielding, my slip catching, my range-hitting, my death bowling,’ he added. Sri Lanka be warned.
