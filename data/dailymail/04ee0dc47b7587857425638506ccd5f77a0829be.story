David Cameron yesterday cited the success of fictional television spies as a reason for reviving the controversial ‘snoopers’ charter’.

The Prime Minister said he wanted to resurrect plans to allow the police and security services to eavesdrop on the public’s internet and mobile phone use.

The contentious legislation was dropped last year amid a storm of protest from civil liberties groups and the Liberal Democrats.

But I saw it on TV: The Prime Minister cited fictional spies in his appearance before the Joint Committee on National Security Strategy yesterday, prompting anger from backbench Tory David Davis

Did I just say that? Cameron was defending proposed new powers for spies to search through e-mails

Mr Cameron said: '¿In the most serious crimes [such as] child abduction, communications data... is absolutely vital ¿ who called who and when, and where was the telephone at the time. Not the content, but the data'

But in an extraordinary intervention, 
Mr Cameron pledged to introduce ‘essential’ new laws after watching TV 
shows Spooks, Homeland and US Sherlock Holmes spin-off Elementary.

The
 award-winning - but fictional - TV crime dramas all portray police and 
intelligence officers using communications data to catch villains.

He told a parliamentary security committee that monitoring private information was essential to keep citizens safe from terrorist attack and serious criminals.

He said: ‘In the most serious crimes [such as] child abduction, communications data... is absolutely vital – who called who and when, and where was the telephone at the time. Not the content, but the  communications data.

‘I love watching crime dramas on the television. There’s hardly a crime drama where a crime is solved without using the data of a mobile communications device.’

‘We have to explain to people is 
that... if we don’t modernise the practice and the law, over time we 
will have the communications data to solve these horrible crimes on a 
shrinking proportion of the total use of devices and that is a real 
problem for keeping people safe.

‘Everybody
 raises questions about who has access to my data and why but I’m 
absolutely convinced that proper rules for communications data is 
essential.’

But Mr Cameron faced ridicule, including from those in his own party.

Tory MP David Davis, who has opposed the snoopers’ charter, said: ‘Sadly, you can’t derive policy from watching fictional crime dramas on TV. Policy should be made using hard evidence, strong arguments and proper data, not the exploits of fictional crime fighters.’

Lib Dem chairman Tim Farron said: ‘Serious policies should be based on evidence, and after to listening to experts,  and not based on what you saw on Homeland.’

And Emma Carr, of Big Brother Watch, said the proposed snoopers’ charter  would have put every citizen under surveillance ‘in a way that the Home Office now acknowledges went too far’.

She added: 'These are very complex issues with enormous implications for privacy. Perhaps the Prime Minister should read President Obama’s independent surveillance review rather than relying on television programmes.'

During an appearance before MPs and Peers on the Joint National Security Strategy Committee, Mr Cameron acknowledged that reviving the unpopular legislation was ‘contentious’.

The new security Bill, which would have forced internet companies to store for a year details of all Britons’ online activity, was blocked last year by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

But Mr Cameron believes action is still needed to reflect the fact criminals are increasingly using internet phone calls or social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to communicate.

The police can already tell when, where and who made a mobile phone call or sent a text message.

But they cannot always trace the origin of an email, a message sent via instant messaging or a phone call made over the internet.

Revelations by US whistleblower Edward Snowden, who lifted the lid on the scale of GCHQ’s role with America’s National Security Agency in monitoring electronic communications around the world, have also seen demands for the law drop down the agenda.
