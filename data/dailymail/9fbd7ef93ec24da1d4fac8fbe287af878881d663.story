TV presenter Natalie Verney was delighted to give birth to twin girls last October but her only regret was that she wasn't able to express her happiness with a beaming smile.

The Channel 5 newsreader was 32 weeks pregnant with her daughters, Seren Rose and Sienna Mai, when she was suddenly struck with Bell's palsy.

The condition causes paralysis in one of side of the face so the Oxfordshire-born journalist went from reading the news on national television one afternoon to not being able to move her lips properly the next.

Sudden development: Natalie Verney went from presenting the Channel 5 news one day to being unable to move one side of her face after the onset of Bell's palsy

She told MailOnline: 'I woke up one day to find the left side of my mouth wasn't working properly. I only noticed when I went to drink my morning cup of tea and it dribbled down my chin. When I looked in the mirror I found my smile was crooked and I couldn't pucker my lips.

'Panicking, I ran to the doctors where I was told, "Don't worry, you're not having a stroke but you do need to go to A&E immediately."

'Two hours later at the hospital and after a number of tests, I was dealt the news that I had Bell's palsy.'

For the next six weeks, Natalie couldn't fully close one of her eyes, eat and drink properly and her attempt to smile was more of a sneer. With the imminent arrival of her daughters with husband Tim, instead of being overwhelmed with excitement for their birth, she worried that her newborns would be terrified of her appearance.

Ordeal: When the symptoms were the worst, Natalie was unable to fully close one eye, eat or drink properly or smile

She explains: 'The most upsetting part of it for me was losing my smile. With only half my mouth moving in the right 
direction my smile looked more like some grotesque sneer. I was so self 
conscious I became a recluse and didn't leave my house, except for 
hospital appointments, for two months.

'What should have been an exciting
 time turned into some of the darkest days of my life. My baby girls 
were going to be born and all I could think about was the fact I 
wouldn't be able to smile at them when I saw them for the first time. I 
was even worried my face would scare them.'

She added: 'I don't have any photos of me
 smiling with my newborn babies and that makes me really sad.'

'... I have no idea why I got it or what caused it and nor do the doctors. It's frustrating'

The symptoms of Bell's palsy can vary from a mild numbness of the face to total paralysis. For some, the paralysis is temporary and in most cases will improve after two to three weeks without treatment. In others, it can take up to a year  to make a full recovery with the aid of steroids and physiotherapy.

Natalie was aware of the condition as her sister had come down with a mild case of it when she had given birth to her third child three years ago.

Figures suggest that pregnant women are three times more likely to get it than anyone else, but it's not clear why.

The NHS state on their website that it occurs when the nerve that controls the facial muscles becomes inflamed or compressed. But they add: 'It is not known what causes the facial nerve to become inflamed, although it is thought that a virus, possibly a herpes virus, may be responsible.'

Natalie said doctors were baffled why she developed it when she did and she has unsuccessfully searched the internet for definite answers.

She said: 'The medical profession doesn't seem to really understand what causes it. Everything I know about the condition is through my own research.

Bitter sweet: Natalie was delighted to become a mother to Seren Rose and Sienna Mai but sad she couldn't properly smile at them at first

'There are lots of theories out there - many people claim they were very stressed before they came down with the condition, meanwhile Chinese medicine believes sleeping next to a fan or driving with an open window can bring it on.

'For me, Bell's palsy came out of the blue. I was enjoying a healthy straightforward twin pregnancy. The babies were growing really well and I hadn't even suffered from morning sickness. I had been happily working and enjoying the hot summer we had last year and I was looking forward to a few weeks of rest before my girls arrived into the world. I have no idea why I got it or what caused it and nor do the doctors. It's frustrating.'

Eight months on, following acupuncture and sessions with a physiotherapist who specialises in facial palsy at The Face Place at Southampton Hospital, Natalie's symptoms have improved.

She said: 'When I look back at photos of my face 
when the Bell's palsy was at it's worst, I can appreciate how remarkable
 my recovery has been up to now. I'm not fully recovered though. I 
currently have about 70 per cent of movement back but it's getting better all 
the time.

'It took six months for me to be able to fully close my eye 
again - that was such a relief. My blink is back too but it's just a bit
 slower than my right eye at the moment. My smile has improved 
enormously - it does at least look like a smile these days - but it's 
still wonky and that's probably the thing I'm most self conscious about.

'People tell me that if they didn't know me before, they wouldn't know 
anything had happened to my face which is reassuring, but I still really
 really hope I get my full smile back one day.'

Not only does she want her daughters to see her full smile, it's also important to her in resuming her career in front of the cameras after her maternity leave.

She said: 'I completed my last shift on 5 News on the Saturday and my Bell's palsy hit on the Monday. In a way I was lucky as I had literally just started my maternity leave so I didn't need to cancel any work.

'I felt nervous about telling Channel 5 about what had happened as I work for them on a freelance basis and I know how fickle the world of television can be. But they have been very supportive and told me to take as much time as I need and to give them a ring when I'm ready to go back.

'As I'm freelance my maternity leave can be as long as I'd like it 
to be, which is lucky as I had originally intended to go back to work 
after six months. Unfortunately, my face hadn't recovered enough - 
that was a decision I made, not Channel 5. I didn't feel confident 
enough to face the camera again. So I'm just enjoying my babies while my
 face recovers and when I feel ready I'll get back out there.'

'...
my gorgeously funny little babies are the reason I have got through this'

In the meantime, Natalie said she loves being a full-time mother at her home in Buckinghamshire.

'They are the best thing that's ever 
happened to me,' she said. 'They are the most gorgeously funny little babies and I'm
 so proud of them. When I was struggling in my final trimester and I was
 very down with the Bell's at it's worst, I was really worried that I'd 
get post natal depression after they were born, but in actual fact they 
are the reason I have got through this.

'Not only do they bring joy to me
 every day but they have given me something else to focus on. The first few months were just a whirlwind, I've never 
been so busy! It really helped because I couldn't worry about my face 
even if I wanted to - I didn't have a minute to spare!'

Natalie has shared her story in the hope it will help other sufferers of the condition that affects about one in 5,000 people a year.

She said: 'Unfortunately there will be other pregnant women out there who will be suffering from Bell's palsy right now. In the early days of the condition I was desperate to find someone else who had experienced it during pregnancy but I couldn't find any information anywhere.

'If my story can help anyone going through those awful first few weeks or months of the condition in any way then I'll be happy.

'There's also a fantastic charity called Facial Palsy UK that I'd advise anyone suffering from Bell's to contact. On their website (www.facialpalsy.org.uk) there is a wealth of information for sufferers and I wish I'd known about them at the beginning.'

Facial Palsy UK is a charity dedicated to helping people affected by all types of facial paralysis. They have been working hard to develop a support network of mothers who have developed Bell's palsy during pregnancy or around the time of giving birth.

Psychologist professor Nichola Rumsey, 
co-director of the Centre for Appearance Research in Bristol is a member
 of the Medical Advisory Board of Facial Palsy UK said: 'The 
psychological and social challenges resulting from facial palsy can be 
considerable. People's daily lives can be negatively affected in many 
ways. There is an urgent need to develop much more effective ways of 
offering appropriate support.'

Vanessa Venables, principal speech and language therapist, co-founder and Trustee of Facial Palsy UK added: 'It is a time when new mums or mums-to-be need high quality advice, information, support and encouragement. It is a time when they may feel vulnerable and least able to help themselves and therefore it’s vitally important for the professionals involved to have the correct advice, information and support at their fingertips. 

'Sadly in my experience this has not been the case.  Apart from the immediate medical management scant attention has been paid to the needs of these women who are left to fend for their newborn child and family without important help and advice.'
