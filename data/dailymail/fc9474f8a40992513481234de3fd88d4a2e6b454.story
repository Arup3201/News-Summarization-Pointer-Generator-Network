England's Under 17 side completed their European Championships qualifying campaign with six wins from six games, after a Ike Ugbo double secured a 2-1 win at the Pirelli stadium.

The young Chelsea striker put John Peacock's side ahead after just seven minutes, firing home at the second time of asking having been denied by the Romanian keeper Catalin Vasile when through on goal.

Adrian Petre equalised for the visitors six minutes later, but Ugbo scored again in the second half to wrap up the points.

The Chelsea youngster could have had a hat-trick, having fired a good chance over the crossbar before the break, but it would not matter in the end.

Romania, captained by Ianis Hagi, son of legendary playmaker Gheorghe, were reduced to ten men after 65 minutes when Istvan Kilyen Szabolcs was dismissed for a second yellow card following a poor tackle on Arsenal's Chris Willock.

England bossed the game from that point on, and though they didn't add to their lead, they were rarely in danger of letting it slip, and can go to the Euros this summer with good momentum.
