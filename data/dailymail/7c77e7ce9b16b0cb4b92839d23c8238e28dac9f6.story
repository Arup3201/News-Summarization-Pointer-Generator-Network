Shocking footage shows the moment a car driving down the wrong side of the freeway ploughed into a family car, causing a fatal accident.

The dash-cam footage was tendered as evidence in the Coronial Inquest into the death of the driver responsible, 38-year-old Jason Rea after the head-on collision on February 4, 2014.

The court heard that at the time of the accident Mr Rea was a crystal meth junkie who was driving with five-times the 'lethal dose' of ice in his system after a five day bender, according toThe Daily Telegraph.

He was travelling on the M1 back to the Central Coast after procuring more drugs from Sydney.

It appears that Mr Rea, in his drug-addled state, became alarmed by the flashing lights of road works.

While in Gosford Coroner’s Court on Wednesday, it was suggested that Mr Rea may have feared police.

He conducted three U-turns to drive on the wrong side of the road and steer dangerously into oncoming traffic.

Evidence stated that Mr Rea intimidated other drivers by aiming for vehicles as drivers tried to swerve out of his way.

Many panicked witnesses called Triple 0, describing how the ‘erratic’ driver was driving in the wrong direction and had almost taken out two workers at the construction site.

‘There’s a fri***ng lunatic on the road, he’s just came straight at me,’ one witness told emergency services, in a call that was used as evidence in court.

‘This guy is just on a death mission,’ another astonished caller said.

Mr Rea’s Ford Falcon smashed head first into a Holden Captiva, which held a family of four, at 8.30pm as he drove southbound on the northbound road, 200 metres from the Hawkesbury Bridge

Christine O’Donnell was driving her sons and daughter-in-law home to Kincumber from a dinner when her car was smashed into at great speed.

She suffered horrific injuries and has already undergone 13 operations since she was injured.

The victim is also still struggling with the mental trauma after the crash.

Ms O’Donnell will soon undergo a serious operation that will cause her excruciating pain every time she tries to place her foot on the floor for a period of three months.

After the accident, Mr Rea crawled out of the passenger window and crawled to safety. His leg was shattered so he was unable to walk.

After he was freed, he was apprehended by a number of construction workers and ‘struggled violently’.

Four police officers and a Rural Fire Service member were required to detain Mr Rea as he continued to lash out.

Paramedics inserted a catheter in Mr Rea’s arm to sedate him, at which point his heart stopped beating.

Although they tried to save his life, he died in the ambulance on route to Gosford Hospital.

The counsel argued that the intensively high amount of ice Mr Rea had in his system was the cause of his death, opposed to mishandling during his arrest.

The inquest continues on Thursday.
