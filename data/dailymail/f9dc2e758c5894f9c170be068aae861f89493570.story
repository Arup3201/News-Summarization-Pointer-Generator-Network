New York is the city that never sleeps, but it appears Brooklyn is the borough with the most night owls - not Manhattan. 

That’s according to a study of sleeping patterns across the U.S., which reveals what time different counties go to bed.

By monitoring the patterns of more than a million people, detailed maps showing how long people sleep for have been created. The visualizations were created by Principal Data Scientist Dr Brian Wilt from San Francisco for Jawbone.

While the average night's rest was below the recommended seven hours in every major U.S. city, New York reigns supreme when it comes to those burning the midnight oil. By borough, Brooklyn stays up the latest with those in Kings County going to bed around 12:07am every 'night'.

Brooklyn is followed by Manhattan (11:55pm), Queens (11:52pm), the Bronx (11:47pm) and Staten Island (11:46pm).

Meanwhile counties who went to bed the earliest include the islands of Kauai and Maui in Hawaii and Greenlee County in Arizona. 

The results were based on data from over one million wearers of Jawbone’s Up fitness tracker.

Counties where there was not enough data were blended with nearby counties.

The map also reveals how at the borders of different time zones sleep patterns are shaped by daylight.

On the western extremes of time zones people go to bed later, presumably as they have more light until the sun sets. Eastern extremes of time zones, meanwhile, see people go to bed earlier for the opposite reason.

Time makes a difference: The map revealed that those on the extreme western borders of time zones tend to go to bed earlier than those on the far eastern borders since daylight plays a role in circadian cycles 

‘Unbeknownst to us, our body’s circadian rhythms tune to sunlight hours, silently influencing you to go to bed when the sun goes down irrespective of the exact time,’ Jawbone reports.

A separate map reveals how many hours of sleep different counties of the U.S. are getting.

It shows that not many are getting eight hours a night, with many hovering around the seven-hour mark. Residents of New York got an average of 6.82 hours of sleep a night.

People in Sawyer County, Wisonsin meanwhile managed to get 7.52 hours of sleep on average.

They found that, in general, most city-dwellers didn't get the recommended seven hours of sleep per night, while most suburban and rural counties were.

Jawbone says they are planning to perform similar of sleep patterns in finer detail around the world.
