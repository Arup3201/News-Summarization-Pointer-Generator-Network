It was so nearly the ultimate fairytale for Che Adams, who came off the bench to score two goals for Sheffield United in their semi-final with Tottenham.

His immediate impact, and first two goals for the club, nearly rescued the Capital One Cup tie for the Blades before Christian Eriksen's late heroics guided Spurs into the final.

But who is the 18-year-old striker who only joined the League One side in November? Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on Sheffield United's cup sensation.

SO WHO IS SHEFFIELD UNITED’S TWO-GOAL HERO?

His full name is Che Zach Everton Fred Adams, the 18-year-old striker was snapped up by the Blades in November.

SHOULD I HAVE HEARD OF HIM?

Probably not. He was playing for non-League Ilkeston FC before moving to the League One side, though he was heavily scouted by the likes of Southampton, Burnley, Sunderland, Norwich and Rangers.

His Blades career had seen him play just three times previously but he did make his debut in the 1-0 win over Southampton in the Capital One Cup quarter-final as a half-time substitute.

Adams came on as a substitute for Sheffield United in the 74th minute and scored three minutes later after finishing neatly across Michel Vorm's goal following a low far post cross

DIDN'T COVENTRY CITY LET HIM SLIP THROUGH THE NET?

Adams was on the books at the Sky Blues before they released him, and his form became so impressive in the non-league ranks that up to 45 scouts were watching him at one point.

HE TOOK HIS GOALS AGAINST SPURS WELL, BUT IS THERE MORE TO HIS GAME?

Indeed there is. His strike record was impressive at Ilkeston with nine goals in 16 games, but he also contributed with 11 assist during that period too. 

WHAT ARE HIS STRONGEST ABILITIES?

It's best to let his former manager Kevin Wilson give a lowdown on that. Wilson was excited about the striker's potential after he sold him to Sheffield United back in November.

'Che is one of those players that comes along every so often and makes you think, ‘wow’,” said Wilson in an interview with The Star.

'He’s got pace in abundance, but he’s really powerful too. I remember a goal he scored against FC United of Manchester, where he picked the ball up in his own half, drove at their defence and finished in the bottom corner.

'His biggest asset is that knack of changing games in the blink of an eye. He stands defenders up and then leaves them for dead. In fact, I’d say he’s capable of doing things that I haven’t seen players do for a long, long time.'

ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HIM?

Adams has already been earmarked to play for Antigua and Barbuda at international level and was formally called up to the England C team last October. He is also eligible to represent Scotland.
