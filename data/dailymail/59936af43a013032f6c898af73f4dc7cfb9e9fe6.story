Instead of giving their real names, the cheeky police note was signed 'Love from Cagney and Lacey'

Being drunk and running into the police would normally spell trouble for most revellers.

But one man found that instead of being slapped with a fine after getting a little worse for wear, instead he got a humorous handwritten note from concerned police officers who had driven him home.

A man, known only as David from Watford, woke on Sunday morning following a heavy night out to discover a note from 'Cagney and Lacey' who had given him a lift after discovering him too drunk to stand.

But instead of giving their real names, the note referred to the 1980s series about female New York detectives starring Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless.

The letter, on Hertfordshire Constabulary notepaper and addressed to David, explained he had been found barely able to stand shortly after 2am on Sunday (January 12).

It said: 'We found you staggering in the road on your way home from Watford.

'You were so drunk we were worried you wouldn’t get home in one piece! So we gave you a lift home.

'Please don’t get that drunk again.'

The humorous message was won praise after it was posted on the UK Cop Humour Facebook page with more than 22,000 people ‘liking’ the comment.

One user and fellow Watford police 
officer Charlie Davison commented: 'And this is why I am proud to be a 
Watford officer, public order is pants but everyone does a great job!'

A spokesman for Hertfordshire Police said it was aware of the letter, but are yet to comment

Mel Cable wrote: 'Absolutely fantastic, kudos to Cagney and Lacey, David struck it lucky to get such good officers willing to help rather than condemn.'

However, other users criticised the officers for intervening at all.

Gurpal Sindhar wrote: 'And if he then tripped over the front door and banged his head the police would get the blame because if they had let him walk home he’d have been sober by the time he got there.'

A spokesman for Hertfordshire Police said it was aware of the letter, but are yet to comment.
