Kimi Raikkonen sustained an incredible 47G impact during his opening-lap shunt at the British Grand Prix.

The Finn was immediately taken to the on-track medical centre after he lost control of his Ferrari on the exit of Turn 5 before smashing into the barrier on the Wellington Straight as he attempted to re-join the track.  

Raikkonen slid helplessly across the circuit with the Williams of Felipe Massa crashing into the side of his stricken Ferrari despite the Brazilian's last-gasp efforts to avoid him.

1.55G - Acceleration from 0 to 60mph in a Bugatti Veyron

8G - F16 aircraft pulling out of a dive

12G - Typical maximum turn in a fighter jet.

15G - Explosive seat ejection from aircraft.

27G - Felipe Massa’s crash at the Canadian Grand Prix 

47G - Kimi Raikkonen's crash at the British Grand Prix

50G - Death or serious injury likely

Raikkonen eventually came to a stop on the other side of the circuit with sufficient damage to his chassis and minus three of his wheels.

The Finn needed assistance getting out of his car before limping into the medical car, and the race was suspended for one hour as repairs were made to the armco following the high-speed crash.

Miraculously, Raikkonen sustained only bruises to his knees and ankles in the accident, but is now a doubt for this week's two-day test at Silverstone.

Ferrari are however confident that Raikkonen, who revealed earlier this week that he is likely to retire from Formula One when his contract expires at the end of next season, will be fit for the German Grand Prix in a fortnight's time.

'Unfortunately, my race today ended on the first lap, after I had managed to get away well, making up enough ground to be fighting for eleventh place,' said Raikkonen, who started in 18th after a miserable qualifying session.

'At turn 5, I went off the track and while trying to get back on, I must have hit a kerb. I then lost control of the car and ended in the barriers.

'I am really very disappointed with how things went today, but now I want to put this incident behind me and just concentrate on the next race in Germany.'

Ferrari team principal Marco Mattiacci added: 'The most important news right now is that Kimi is alright, even though the impact with the barriers was a heavy one. He has some bruising and will now be resting to be in shape for the next race.'

Raikkonen is the second driver to experience a high impact from the last three races after Massa's 27G horror crash with Sergio Perez at last month's Canadian Grand Prix.

Speaking about the incident earlier this week, Massa, who was forced to retire from today's race following rear suspension damage sustained in the incident with Raikkonen, said: 'I was sure it was going to hurt because it was so quick.

'It is the worst feeling you can have knowing that the wall is coming at you so quickly. I pulled 27G on the crash but thank God I am here and nothing happened to me.'
