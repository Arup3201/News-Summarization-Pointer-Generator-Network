A British woman who gave birth to a baby girl while awaiting trial in a notorious Pakistani prison has been sentenced to life for attempting to smuggle 63kg of heroin out of the country.

Khadija Shah, from Birmingham, was pregnant with her third child, when she was arrested at Islamabad airport in May 2012 after the drugs, worth an estimated £3.2 million, were found in her luggage.

The 26-year-old gave birth to daughter Malaika while in custody. Her Lawyer said the baby, now 16-months-old, will remain with her in prison.

Shah's other children, a five-year-old 
boy and a four-year-old daughter, have been returned to Britain while 
Malaika has spent her entire life behind bars.

Last year Shah, who had faced the possibility of the death penalty, said Malaika was the only thing keeping her sane as she waited to find out if she would be given the death penalty.

'If Malaika was not here, I would be crazy because things are very hard,' she told Vice at the time. 'She keeps me strong.'

'I
 am still breastfeeding,' Mrs Shah said. 'Every three months Prisoners 
Abroad give me some money for basic food items and Pampers for the baby,
 who I keep clean.

'She likes to play with empty wrappers of food items. I usually try to keep our surroundings clean, too.'

The mother and baby are being held at Adaila jail in Rawalpindi which holds some of Pakistan's most dangerous terrorists.

They currently share a cell with six to eight other women. But now she has been convicted she will be moved to another barrack with other convicted female prisoners.

According to her lawyer, the conditions in Adiala are about as bad as it can get in South Asia. The food consists primarily of bread and soup and there have been several reports of epidemics breaking out. 

Attorney
 Shahzad Akbar said Shah was arrested at Islamabad Airport in 2012 for 
carrying 63 kilograms of heroin in two suitcases.

He
 said Shah was set up by a friend, whom he named as Imran Khan. He said 
Khan brought her along with her other two children, then aged 4 and 5, 
to Pakistan for a visit of several weeks, lavishly bearing all the 
expenses to gain her confidence.

Shah, 26, gave birth to daughter Malaika while in custody. Her Lawyer said the baby, now 16-months-old, will remain with her in prison

He said: 'On her return to the UK, Khan gave her two suitcases for his friend whose daughter was getting married.

'She never knew heroin was concealed in the bridal clothes.'

Akbar said he will appeal the verdict. 'I am hopeful that I can get justice for her'.

The
 legal charity Reprieve has raised concerns over Shah's case and are 
demanding that Britain review the £5million it has given Pakistan since 
2010 to fight drug smuggling.

Maya Foa, a director of Reprieve said: 'This is a terrible outcome for Khadija and her baby Malaika,' 

The
 British government 'must ensure that Khadija gets the urgent assistance
 she needs to appeal her sentence so that her baby doesn't grow up 
behind bars,' Foa said in a statement.

'As
 happens in hundreds of cases, she was used as a drugs mule without her 
knowledge, and yet is facing life in a Pakistani prison,' Foa said.

The statement said Pakistan hands down 'excessively harsh sentences ... to vulnerable, exploited women such as Khadija.'

Due to its proximity to Afghanistan, where much of the world's opium is grown, Pakistan is a drug transit route.

Authorities
 frequently announced the arrest of both Pakistanis and foreign 
nationals at airports. Drug cartels also use sea routes.
