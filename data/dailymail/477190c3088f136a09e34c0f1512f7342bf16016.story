Crushed: Former Real House Wife of Beverly Hills Adrienne Maloof broke down in tears when she learned her first husband Steve Marks, Jr. is on his deathbed

Adrienne and Steve spoke to each other on a regular basis over the years, and when he broke the news to her that he had cancer and he would not recover, Adrienne broke down in tears and was inconsolable.

Steve told Adrienne by the time the doctors diagnosed him it was too late to save his life.

'Unlike her second husband, Paul Nassif, Steve was a nice guy, who really loved Adrienne and wouldn't do anything to hurt her,' a close family friend told MailOnline.

Adrienne and Paul, 51, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, have been battling in court since he filed for separation on July 30, 2012 and it hasn't stopped even though the divorce was finalized on November 8, 2012.

Last month Adrienne went to court in an attempt to get a restraining order against Paul after he allegedly grabbed her arm to prevent her from taking pictures of their sons at a basketball game.

Paul claimed Adrienne was actually filming him to use against him in court.

The judge continued the case so they will be heading back to court again to settle this matter.

'Adrienne is frustrated and scared of Paul'. the family friend told MailOnline.

But she is not letting her fear stop her from moving on with her life. Adrienne is very happy with Jacob Busch, 24, and it looks like they have gotten very serious.

As reported in the Daily Mail Online last month Jacob, the heir to the Anheuser-Busch empire, presented Adrienne with a large diamond ring over the Valentine's holiday.

'Its a beautiful green diamond,' the family friend added, 'and she is thrilled.

'But now one of her longest and dearest friends is dying and she said it's hard to see him suffer like this.

'Adrienne told me love never goes away. You just continue your journey knowing. The thoughts never go away. Because it's an authentic relationship and he is really going to be missed.'
