The remains of a woman who apparently lay dead in the front room of her home in Bexleyheath, south-east London (pictured) for more than a decade

The remains of a woman who apparently lay dead in her front room for more than a decade were only discovered after the death of the son who shared her home.

Police believe Doris Ames’s body was left to decompose after her younger son Martin, 55, failed to tell anyone that she had died.

The grisly discovery was made by her estranged elder son Alan, who visited the family home on Friday following the sudden death of his brother from lung cancer.

To his horror, the 61-year-old found the skeleton of his mother in the front room of the house in Bexleyheath, south-east London.

It was the first time he had stepped into the dilapidated £335,000 semi-detached home in over ten years after having a row with his brother. The elderly widow, thought to have been in her 70s, had not been seen for years by neighbours.

She had been left alone with her reclusive son Martin after her 62-year-old husband died in 1985 and Alan had later moved out.

Last night neighbours said they assumed Mrs Ames had died, although they thought it strange they never heard of her funeral. 

They described her son Martin as a recluse who was only rarely seen leaving the house.

Neighbours said that they had seen Alan return to the property several times in recent years but that the two brothers would only ever speak outside the house.

Tom Carpenter, 68, who has lived opposite the Ames family home since 1973, said: ‘They were an extremely introverted and never really spoke to anybody on the street. They weren’t the kind of family that you would pass the time of day with.’

Mr Carpenter’s wife Linda, 67, said that locals had long speculated about why there had never been a funeral for Mrs Ames. She said that Martin told neighbours his mother had died, without revealing details about the death.

Mrs Carpenter said: ‘It makes you feel bad as we have always wondered why there had never been a funeral.

‘And we always said it was strange that her body was never seen being taken out of the house.’

Last night the front of the property was shrouded by overgrown shrubbery in the garden. It is thought that Martin Ames used to work in a supermarket but had been unemployed in recent years.

Detectives believe that Mrs Ames’s body had been in the house for at least ten years, given the advanced state of decomposition. It is not known how she died.

Officers are now awaiting post-mortem examination results. A crime scene is still in place.

Mrs Carpenter, a hairdresser, said: ‘You could never really tell how old she [Mrs Ames] was. She would go out every day wearing exactly the same clothes.’

‘I remember seeing her in the supermarket ... but she just put her head down. Maybe she just died and he couldn’t let her go.’
