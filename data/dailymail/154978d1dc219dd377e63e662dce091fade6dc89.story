Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor has blasted Yaya Toure and his Ivory Coast team-mates for trying to be heroes rather than playing together.

The Togolese striker was hugely critical of a squad brimming with Premier League stars including Kolo Toure, Cheick Tiote and Wilfried Bony, as well as former Premier League stars Didier Drogba and Gervinho.

'I never trust them. They are the country that will always let you down,' said Adebayor speaking to Ghana SoccerNet.

He added: 'How come for the last four or five years have they not won the African Cup of Nations? They have got the best striker in Europe in Didier Drogba. They have got the best midfielder today, Yaya Toure. You’ve got one of the best strikers in the league today, Wilfried Bony. You have all of those players.

'But the thing is, are they going to be collective enough? I don’t know. I am not an Ivorian. They will be talking, laughing and enjoying themselves but when the time comes, they will forget about their job.'

Adebayor rates Nigeria's chances as the best among the five African nations, because they have the best 'concentration', while Ghana, whose squad is full of European players, much like the Ivory Coast, are over-reliant on Asamoah Gyan.

Continuing his Ivory Coast criticism, Adebayor added: 'There’s no togetherness. Everyone wants to be the hero.

'Everybody wants to be the one to finish on a high so the folks remember them for what I have done, not for what we have done as a generation, nor for what we have done as team.

'Everyone wants to be like a hero and that is what is killing Ivory Coast.'
