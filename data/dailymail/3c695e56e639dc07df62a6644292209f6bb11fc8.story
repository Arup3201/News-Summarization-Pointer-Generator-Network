Hacker: Glenn Mulcaire said today that he believed he had the 'blessing of police' when he intercepted voicemails from Milly Dowler's phone 

Hacker Glenn Mulcaire believed he had 'the blessing of the police' to legally hack the voicemails of missing schoolgirl Milly Dowler, the Old Bailey heard today.  

Mulcaire, who was paid £100,000-a-year by the News of the World, says he believed the tabloid was trying to find the 13-year-old using her mobile and PIN number given out by Surrey detectives.

Arguing why he should not be jailed when he is sentenced along with Andy Coulson and three others on Friday, Mulcaire thought he was the police's 'lead eye' and did not believe hacking voicemails was illegal.

'He understood the objective was to find Miss Dowler, who by then had been missing for over two weeks', said Gavin Millar QC. 

'He was led to believe his work on the case had the blessing of the police and he was fortified in the belief because he was working for a large news orginisation.

'His taskers, he was aware, had close connections with the police, and they had provided him with Milly's mobile number and PIN number he believed had been provided to them by police officers.'

Mr Millar added: 'He believed he acted with lawful authority in intercepting the answerphone of Milly Dowler with the full knowledge and authority of the police.

'He believed he had been appointed lead eye, and was proud to be so highly regarded by hiis taskers and the police.'

Mulcaire was tasked on the Dowler hack by chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, and named news editor Greg Miskiw and another executive.

'He was not aware of any suggestion a story would be published in connection with the interception of Milly Dowler's voicemails', he added.

'He thought the information would be given to the police.' 

The court heard that former editor Andy Coulson and three of his most senior staff 'utterly corrupted' the News of the World at the highest level and presided over phone hacking on an industrial scale.

Coulson, 46, had denied plotting to hack phones between 2000 and 2006 but was found guilty following a marathon Old Bailey trial which went on for 139 days.

Today, he was joined in the dock by three ex-news editors - Neville Thurlbeck, Greg Miskiw and James Weatherup - and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire who all pleaded guilty to phone hacking before the trial began last year.

Facing jail: Andy Coulson was convicted last week and told that he faces up to two years in prison

They now face up to two years in jail for their part in the plot which the prosecution said involved a veritable 'Who's Who of Britain' having their private lives invaded through voicemail interception.

Previously, the NotW had insisted phone hacking was the work of one 'rogue reporter', Clive Goodman who was convicted of phone hacking with Mulcaire in 2006.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: 'Anyone who has ever suggested or believed or been told that phone hacking that was revealed in 2006/7 was the work of a single rogue reporter needs to look carefully at this dock in which there are four employees of the NotW and only one of them can be described as a reporter, Thurlbeck who was chief reporter.'

He went on: 'The newsdesk editor job was described as being the hub or engine room of the paper therefore all of these four defendants can be described as highly paid and influential employees of a national newspaper.

'Between them these defendants utterly corrupted this newspaper which became at the highest level a criminal enterprise.

'This was systemic misconduct approved and participated in by the editor himself.'

Mr Edis told the court that hundreds of high profile individuals had been targeted by Mulcaire and the NotW journalists but the full extent of hacking may never be known.

Over the years, Mulcaire had been paid around half a million pounds by the NotW to hack phones at the request of the newsdesk executives, the court heard.

Of Coulson's former colleagues, Miskiw was the most heavily implicated and made some 1,500 taskings to Mulcaire between 1999 and 2006, some even after he had left the newspaper.

On July 21 2004, he asked Mulcaire to target Spectator publisher Kimberly Quinn over her involvement with former home secretary David Blunkett.

He and Thurlbeck were also responsible for instructing Mulcaire over the Milly Dowler hacking in 2002, the court heard.

In all, Thurlbeck's name appeared on 261 pages of Mulcaire's notes, Mr Edis said.

Weatherup was the least involved in the plot. His name appeared on just 157 pages of the private detective's notes.

Weatherup, Miskiw and Thurlbeck were all involved in targeting another former home secretary Charles Clarke over a false rumour he was having an affair.

In April 2006, Mulcaire was overloaded with hacking work, mistakes were made and the NotW plotters started 'turning in on themselves', Mr Edis said.

By then, the prosecutor said: 'It is apparent from his notes Mr Coulson himself became a victim of his own conspiracy and others were also hacked.'

Mr Edis went on to apply for costs. The total cost of the hacking trial was around £1.7 million but the elements of the case which led to convictions for phone hacking was around £750,000, the court heard.

It came as Andy Coulson and former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman were told they face a retrial over claims they agreed to buy two royal phone books from corrupt police officers.

Last week the hacking trial jury failed to return verdicts on whether Coulson, 46, and Goodman, 56, conspired to commit misconduct in a public 
office.

Coulson was back at the Old Bailey today and faces up to two years in jail when he is sentenced for his hacking conspiracy prosecution on Friday.

Reaction: Coulson, pictured today, and fellow defendant
 Clive Goodman, last week, face a retrial after the hacking jury failed to decide if they had conspired to bribe police for royal phone numbers

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said today: 'The CPS has taken the position to proceed with the retrial.'

Last week David Cameron was humiliated after 
speaking out about Coulson's conviction while the jury was still 
deliberating on the conspiracy charges he and Goodman face.

Justice
 Saunders said he was 'very concerned' about the comments the Prime 
Minister made after his former spin doctor was found guilty of plotting 
to hack phones at the News of the World.

The Prime Minister also said that Coulson had lied to him, which was 'capable of affecting Mr Coulson's credibility in their (the jury's) eyes', the judge said.

Coulson, of Charing in Kent, already faces jail after the jury found him guilty of plotting to hack phones at the NotW between 2000 and 2006 following the Old Bailey trial which went on for 139 days.

Goodman, of Addlestone, Surrey, pleaded guilty to phone hacking in 2006 and despite admitting his activities were more extensive than he had previously said, he will not face any further legal action over it.

Lawyers are expected to mitigate for the defendants before Mr Justice Saunders hands down sentences on Friday.
