Suicide: Troll victim Hannah Smith, 14, killed herself after being bullied on website Ask.fm

The father of a teenage girl who killed herself after months of bullying online has said changes to social networking site Ask.fm do not go far enough.

David Smith wants the controversial website to ban all anonymous posts to stop online bullies hiding their true identities.

He also said he has not received an apology after he accused Ask.fm of trying to ‘discredit’ his daughter by saying most of the abuse she received she sent to herself.

Fourteen-year-old Hannah Smith was found hanged in her bedroom earlier this month after suffering months of abuse on the controversial ‘question and answer’ site.

The Latvian based website has been linked to the deaths of four other teenagers including Daniel Perry, 17, from Dunfermline in July and Josh Unsworth, 15, from Lancashire in April.

Specsavers, Vodafone, Laura Ashley, EDF Energy and charity Save the Children all pulled adverts from Ask.fm amid the controversy surrounding Hannah’s death.

Now the site has announced a number of new measures designed to make it safer to for young people to use the site after an independent review.

Among the changes are the introduction of a higher-profile button for reporting bullying and a pledge to respond within 24 hours.

It will also set up a separate website for parents to find out more about Ask.fm and hire more site moderators.

The review - which will be implemented by next spring - was due to be announced last Friday but was postponed to allow Hannah’s funeral to take place.

Mr Smith, 45, yesterday said the auditors had ‘taken a good, long look’ at the website and the measures would make the site safer.

But he said: ‘It’s a shame that someone has to go through what I and my family have gone through to get a company to change its ways.’

And he added: ‘I think they’ve gone far enough to make the website safe for teenagers to use but I also think they can do a bit more.

‘Get rid of the anonymous bit completely, because if you are anonymous, you can bully.’ Mr Smith said that he emailed the company immediately after his daughter’s death on August 2, but claimed it blocked his emails.

He also criticised what he believes were attempts to ‘discredit’ his daughter after reports emerged that she posted some of the abusive questions aimed at her on the site.

The lorry driver said: ‘That stung me for a day or two, but then I thought I would carry on trying to push for a change.

‘Ask.fm have not apologised, but they have done something to make teenagers safe.

‘I didn’t want the website closed down, I wanted it made safe for people to use and now it will, hopefully.’ Mr Smith has vowed to ‘keep fighting’ for a change in the law compelling websites like Ask.fm to hand over the details of any online abusers to police.

Ask.fm has said it will make it easier for users to opt out of receiving anonymous messages and it will limit the number of features unregistered users can access.

But the family of apprentice mechanic Daniel Perry also warned more needed to be done to guarantee safety on the site.

Daniel jumped from the Forth Road Bridge in Scotland after being targeted by trolls on Ask.fm and receiving threatening messages via Skype.

Speaking on behalf of his family his uncle Ron Reilly, 47, said: ‘The best thing I think is for the site to be closed down for good.

Another victim: Daniel Perry, 17, killed himself after being targeted in a blackmail plot and told to commit suicide by anoymous users of ask.fm.

‘But if it did it would just start again under a new name so at least this way it can be monitored.

‘At least now we’re moving in the right direction, there is plenty more than can and needs to be done.

‘I think it’s all you can do, you’ve got to start somewhere.’ The father of Josh Unsworth, who was found hanged after suffering months of abuse from trolls on the site, said the changes were ‘too little, too late’.

Gary Unsworth, 47, from Goosnargh, Lancashire said: ‘It’s a positive step.

‘But it’s taken them a long time to get to this point and I’m not going to say “well done” because it’s too little, too late.

‘The changes are fair and reasonable but the proof will be in the pudding.’ Mr Unsworth, a director of a vehicle hire company, also said he was concerned users would still have the option to remain anonymous.

He said: ‘It all comes down to money really ‘Ask.fm have made these changes because they’ve been put under pressure by advertisers and the press.

‘It’s a business at the end of the day and they had to do something or risk going into the red.’ Ask.fm said it would create a ‘bullying/harassment’ category for reported comments alongside ‘spam or scam’, ‘hate speech’ ‘violence’ and ‘pornographic content’.

John Carr, secretary of the UK’s Children’s Charities Coalition on Internet Safety, who is an adviser to the government on child safety gave a cautious welcome to the changes.

He said: ‘The number of moderators they employ will be crucial as well as how fast they can be trained.

‘But the measures they’ve announced definitely show they got the message and are moving in the right direction.’

Ask.fm has grown increasingly popular among young people with 1.4m internet users from the UK visiting the site in July.

The site makes around £5m a year from advertising aimed at its 60m users.

Its Russian co-founders Ilja and Mark Terebin said: ‘The number of users on Ask.fm has increased dramatically since our launch in 2010.

‘As the site grows we recognise that it must also mature and adapt, not only to stay relevant and attractive to our users but to promote a safe and respectful environment.

‘It is our hope that, as part of our continuing commitment to improve our site and its safety features, these changes will help achieve this.’
