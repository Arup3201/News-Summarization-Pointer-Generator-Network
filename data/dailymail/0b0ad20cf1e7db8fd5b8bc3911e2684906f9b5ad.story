John McAfee has settled down in Lexington, Tennessee with his wife and plans to stay there, confessing: 'I'm tired of running.'

The millionaire software tycoon, who made his fortune in cyber security, fled his home in Belize in 2012 after he was named as a 'person of interest' in the murder of his neighbor.

He moved to Portland, Oregon and then to Montreal after he was evicted. Now he and his wife Janice are living in plain sight in Lexington - even though he believes he's still a wanted man.

'I've been on the move for two years because the government of Belize is trying to silence me,' he told USA Today. 'I speak out against the government. I have a great deal of information that implicates the government in very heinous crimes and gross corruption.'

Staying put: John McAfee, pictured before leaving Belize, is now living in Lexington, Tennessee after two years of being on the run from assassins from Belize, he said. He is now prepared to stand up for himself, he said

He would not provide any further details.

McAfee, 69, explained that he spent most of last year running from assassins sent from Belize, where he was named in the shooting death of Gregory Faull, 52, in November 2012. 

McAfee fled the country, saying he feared the crime would give Belize authorities an excuse to finally hold him because he had repeatedly accused them of corruption.

Since then, he has moved 'from town to town, from hotel to hotel', he told USA Today.

'I'm finally tired of it, I'm settling down and I'm defending my home,' he said.' I'm tired of running. I've gone from being frightened to mostly angry.'

Still - he's prepared for if authorities turn up at his door. He says it's just a matter of time.

'I'm fully prepared for the eventuality that there will be an attempted raid on my residence or my car or my person at some place or at some time,' he said. 'At some point you have to stand up and defend your position, your home, your family - and that's what I'm doing.'

He claimed that his car had recently been shot at, but that the vehicle has been fitted with a heavy-duty crash guard in case he is ever cornered and needs to force his way through vehicles.

He added, 'I am constantly armed, I am an excellent shot' - explaining that he has won numerous shooting contests.

Mystery: He was named as a person of interest in the murder of his neighbor, Greg Faull (pictured), in 2012. McAfee claims authorities  wanted to hold him because he had accused them of corruption

Authorities in Lexington and the mayor have welcomed him and his tech acumen with open arms, he said. He now lives there with his wife Janice, whom he married in 2013.

He works as a security expert for Fox News via Skype and occasionally appears at hacker conferences, where his security is tight.

He also oversees and mentors around 10 start-ups, while also developing his own security products, USA Today reported.

According to reports, his fortune, which was totaled more than $100million, has dwindled down to a few million dollars - possibly less - but he would not comment on this.

Faull, who lived next to McAfee, was found dead in his home in November 2012.

He had previously filed a complaint against McAfee's 'dangerous' dogs and in the days before his death, McAfee had found a couple of his dogs poisoned. 

After his death, McAfee said they had only ever exchanged a handful of words and that he had never thought Faull was behind the dog poisonings.

He also offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Faull's killer - but this didn't convince Faull's family, who have sued McAfee, claiming he killed the man or ordered his death.
