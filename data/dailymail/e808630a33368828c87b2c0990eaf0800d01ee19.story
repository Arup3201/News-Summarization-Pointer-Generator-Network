A school has come under fire after asking parents to spend up to £400 on an iPad for lessons.

Gryphon School, in Sherborne, Dorset, sent a letter home 'explicitly recommending' that parents purchase an Apple tablet in time for the next academic year in September.

It said it is aiming for every pupil in years
 seven, eight and nine to be equipped with an iPad, and has written to parents explaining three options for purchasing the device, which it says is 'entirely optional'.

Gryphon School, in Sherborne, Dorset, sent a letter home 'explicitly recommending' that parents purchase an Apple tablet in time for the next academic year in September

The school does not have funds to pay for them and has offered long-term price plans, but is encouraging parents to make a one-off payment of £424 or £306 for an iPad Mini.

Parent Giles Bennett said: 'Having an expensive, desirable and portable device upon a child's person creates a threat situation for them from both inside and still worse, from outside the school.

'Bringing up a family is hard these days, nothing is getting any cheaper. Why the school thinks that most parents have hundreds of pounds to available for these things is a bit of a mystery.

'It worries me that the school is so divorced from the realities facing many of its pupils' families.'

The school has laid out three payment options.

Option One - described as 'the one the school would recommend' - involves an outright purchase for £424 for a full-sized iPad or £306 for a Mini including a cover and insurance.

Option Two is £300 and £197 respectively without a cover or insurance and Option Three involves monthly installments ranging from £10.50 a month to £21 per month which can be spread between 24 and 36 months.

Angered parents have set up a Facebook page to discuss the proposals in which one mother suggested it was not fair for state schools to expect them to part with so much cash.

Juliana Atyeo, whose son Oskar is in Year 7, wrote: 'State education should be free for all. Asking parents to part with this amount of money so that their children can access the curriculum inherently contradicts the principle of state education.

'Even though the school has proposed a monthly payment plan it is unfair to ask parents to sign up to what is essentially a credit scheme.

'Demanding that all students have access to an iPad in order to participate in exercises centrally set by the teacher may have a long-term negative impact on the students' attitudes to learning.

'The message being sent out is that students require a specific technological device in order to learn.'

Gryphon School is rated 'good' by Ofsted and has over 2,000 pupils including the sixth form.

In a joint statement, headteacher Steve Hillier and chairman of the governors Nigel Rees said: 'There is no requirement for students in any year to acquire an iPad, but it is widely felt that there is a clear benefit in the student being able to use any tablet, small laptop or mobile technology as an additional route to learning.'
