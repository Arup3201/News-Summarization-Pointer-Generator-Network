Dominique Ansel, creator of the Cronut, has announced plans to open a store in Tokyo.

This will be the second storefront for the world-renowned pastry chef, who launched his eponymous bakery in New York's Soho neighborhood in 2011.

The new outpost will open in Omotesando Hills, a shopping complex in central Tokyo, in summer 2015.

Mr Ansel made the announcement on Instagram Wednesday afternoon.

'Dear Tokyo! Yes - it is true. We will be opening our first international store (and second store in the world) here in Japan. This is something that means a lot to me and a city that every pastry chef aspires to.'

Mr Ansel said that he was grateful to his partners TSI Holdings and Transit General, known for their work with fashion and food brands.

He added: 'There will be something created just for Tokyo, and I will personally see every aspect of development. I can't wait to personally welcome everyone on opening day.'

The pastry chef rose to fame last year after inventing the Cronut, a donut/croissant hybrid so popular that customers would wait in line for it hours before the bakery opened.

Just last month, he introduced his latest dessert innovation, the Pretzel Lobster Tail - soft pretzels stuffed with peanut butter and butter-crunch brittle in the shape of a crustacean.

His creations have also included a chocolate chip cookie shot, a chocolate souffle hidden in a brioche and a sundae in a can.

Earlier this year, the James Beard Foundation named him as America's best pastry chef.

Mr Ansel recently told FastCoDesign that he doesn't want the Cronut's success to kill his creativity.

'I’m glad we created it at the bakery, but at the same time, I don’t think we should only bet on the Cronut. I have a lot more ideas,' he said.

He added: 'If I were only doing Cronuts, I think I’d be kind of sad. I wouldn’t have a chance to keep doing new things. I’m super excited about creating new products. And my staff is super excited.'
