Tottenham striker Harry Kane is in contention to make his England debut on Friday night against Lithuania in their Euro 2016 qualifier.

The 21-year-old has been in sparkling form for Spurs this season - having netted 29 goals in all competitions so far.

Thrill of a debut

I’ll never forget what it was like getting that first call.

It was the start of 1966 and West Ham’s manager Ron Greenwood took me aside in training and said I had been picked for a game against Poland. It was real elation even if I didn’t play.

I made my debut a month later against West Germany. Why this is relevant to Harry is the confidence you get from reaching that level. That could be a very big factor for this lad.

Hurst made his debut for England in a 1-0 friendly win against West Germany in February 1966

Confidence

Self-belief is a huge thing in football, especially for strikers. When I got my England debut I felt 10 feet tall.

With the season Harry has had, and now this selection, his extra confidence means we should be able to expect even more from him. The challenge will be doing it again next season.

People will analyse how you mark him, how you stop him.

It will be very interesting to see how he reacts to that. I would say he is not vulnerable to that, when I think about his character.

Character

What I like is that Harry has not had it all his own way - he had to fight to get in, he had to go out on loan. It has not been smooth. I wasn’t a world-class player coming through but we have seen lots of players who have become more successful than those around them with more talent.

Dedication and attitude are such key traits and Harry has those in abundance.

I saw him receive an award recently at a charity dinner. You could see how level-headed he is.

Kane has had several spells out on loan before breaking into the Tottenham first-team this season

The Ingredients

Looking at Harry, I am reminded of a speech I heard years ago by Bill Shankly. He was talking about Chelsea’s Peter Osgood and said: ‘Peter is deceptive - he is much slower than you think he is.’

I liken that to Harry. He is deceptive - he is much better than you think he is.

Harry is a bit like Thomas Muller, the Bayern Munich and Germany forward.

On your first glance at Muller, he doesn’t look like a footballer. He has his socks down his shins, looks ungainly.

But he’s a fantastic player. I liken Harry to that type of all-round player.

Strengths

I like how he shoots. He is almost always on target. He can score from distance or a tap-in - and that is a whole different skill. He can anticipate and poach.

He has excellent technique. He strikes the ball cleanly and that is why he is often on target. It is also why he is so good at keeping the ball low. How often do you see him shoot over? The other thing is they come from all directions.

He will still be unpredictable next year because there is not one set place he shoots from.

It helps that he is so comfortable with each foot, unlike a lot of players today.

More than that, Harry has football intelligence which is especially important for strikers.

His awareness of space on the pitch is very good.

Throw in the fact he is very, very good in the air, strong physically and willing to press and defend, and you have a striker to be excited about. He is a team player.

I will save my excitement until the end of next season to see if he has done it again - look at Ravel Morrison - but Harry looks very good.

Weaknesses

I don’t think he has electric pace. But I didn’t have that and it didn’t do me any harm.

He is not slow - he can still run at players - but it is not electric pace.

Teddy Sheringham was like that and I think Harry has Teddy’s intelligence.

Despite a lack of pace, Teddy Sheringham made 51 appearances for England - scoring 11 goals
