Schapelle Corby has denied a man arrested for marijuana possession in Bali last month is her boyfriend. 

Ms Corby, 37, must stay away from drugs and crime as a condition of her parole for drug smuggling, which also requires her to stay in Bali under strict supervision. 

Ms Corby was released from Keroboban prison five months ago after serving nine years in jail for transporting 4.2 kgs of cannabis into Indonesia.

It was reported that Ben Panangian is Corby's boyfriend. The 32-year-old was arrested for possessing nine grams of marijuana last month in Nusa Duar, which could spell trouble for Corby's prospective freedom in 2017.

It was reported that 32-year-old Ben Panangian, who met Corby behind bars, is in a relationship with Ms Corby

Ms Corby reported to parole officers in Denpasar on Wednesday with her brother-in-law and guarantor, Wayan Widyartha.

Expecting a media presence, Corby wore two scarfs wrapped around her face and complained about the presence of reporters in the office.

'Why are there people here?' she asked staff, speaking in Indonesian.

She left after her 10-minute check-in, without speaking to reporters.

Head of the counselling section Ni Ketut Sukiati, said Corby denied Panangian is her boyfriend.

'But I don't know if she's telling the truth or lying,' she told reporters.

'I stressed to her to not to do anything suspicious. If she wants to be freed in 2017, she must complete her parole well.'

Despite promises to work in her brother-in-law's Kuta surf shop, Corby told the parole officers she is spending her days reading books and that 'in time, she'll work'.

Corby met Panangian, a surfer, behind bars in Kerobokan jail.

He was arrested on August 20 after he arrived at a friend's place in the midst of a drug raid, police say.

It's alleged he tried to flee and threw a package on the ground containing marijuana.

A later search of his Kuta home allegedly uncovered more marijuana in his bedroom cupboard.

He faces returning to jail for up to 12 years if he's convicted.
