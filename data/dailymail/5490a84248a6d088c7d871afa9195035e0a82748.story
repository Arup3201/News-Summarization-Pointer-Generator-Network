From kissing an 13ft alligator on the nose just a week after it had bitten someone else to walking over broken glass, this fearless daredevil is a real life female Jackass.

Stunt-woman Rachel Star Withers, 29, is giving Johnny Knoxville a run for his money by completing crazy stunts and pushing the boundaries of acceptable behaviour.

Ms Withers of South Carolina, said completing stunts was an 'excuse' for her to push her limits and 'find out what is possible'.

Rachel Star Withers kisses a 13ft long alligator which had bitten someone else just a week before

Ms Withers gets to know the alligator a little better, before leaning in to plant a kiss on its nose

The 29-year-old adopts a cautious stance as a feisty alligator rushes at her with open jaws

She has been compared to stunt man Johnny Knoxville who is the star of the Jackass movies and TV show

She said: 'I'm the kind of person who sees someone do something cool and then I want to do it too.

'Real life is way scarier than my stunts, and I think pushing my fear in my controlled environment helps me to take on the world.'

Ms Withers rates the alligator kiss as her 'most dangerous', but said it was 'so worth it'.

A photo of the stunt is now the wallpaper picture on her cellphone, something that reminds her 'that I'm a badass when I'm having a rough day and feeling down on myself'.

Ms Withers said she has always been 'extremely daring', as she comes from a family of travellers and risk takers.   

For the past eight years, Ms Withers has completed a host of daring stunts, which she researches before attempting.

Ms Withers said stunts are an 'excuse' for her to push her limits and 'find out what is possible'

Ms Withers uses her breasts like a hammer to crush a stack of beer cans lined up along a bench

The stunt woman covers her eyes and braces herself as a friend prepares to shoot her with a pellet gun

Something which has probably helped her avoid serious injury. So far the daredevil has only suffered bruising. 

Ms Withers says she has an 'ongoing list of stunts I want to perform', and videos them when the mood takes her. 

She said: 'I just hit record and whatever happens happens. Some of my best stuff is completely unplanned.

'The most common reaction I get is people say I'm crazy.'

But Ms Withers is never deterred: 'Pretty much everything I attempt someone tells me it's too dangerous or not possible.

Leaning back, Ms Withers opens her throat as a friend slowly places a sword into her mouth 

In freezing conditions Ms Withers goes outside in just shorts and a bikini top and rubs snow on her body

'For things I know that no one will want me doing, I usually don't tell them about it till after I am done shooting.' 

Thanks to her wild antics, Ms Withers has appeared on a host of TV shows, including NBC's American Ninja Warrior and America's Got Talent, as well as MTV's Ridiculousness and What the Flip?.

Far from saying the classic, 'don't try this at home', stunt line, Ms Withers says anyone can perform daring tricks, 'if you take the time to learn'.

For her next trick, Ms Withers is 'saving up for an epic trip' involving sharks.
