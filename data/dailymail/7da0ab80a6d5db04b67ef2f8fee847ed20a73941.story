A man who stepped into the frame of a picture being taken outside a bar was beaten so badly he has been blinded in one eye.

The 30-year-old victim was knocked unconscious but the attackers continued to beaten him after he accidentally photobombed their shot.

The unidentified man suffered intra-cranial haemorrhage and facial fractures, and he will never see again in his right eye, according to the New York Daily News.

Charged: Terrell Moore (left), Lindsye Newton (centre) and Bryanna Warren (right) were all charged with assault after beating a man unconscious following a mistaken photobomb incident outside a Denver bar

The attack happened early in the morning outside a bar in LoDo, Denver, shortly after the venue had closed.

People were out in the street and taking photos of each other when the mistaken photobomb incident happened.

Bryana Warren, 25, was infuriated and started arguing with the victim and hitting him, according to The Denver Channel.

Police documents revealed she pushed the man, and then he pushed her back before walking away.

But Warren and her friend Lindsye Newton, also 25, followed him and hurled abuse at him. The victim once again pushed them away.

Reacting, Terrell Moore, 27, jumped in and knocked the 30-year-old unconscious - a punch that was witnessed by police.

The assault happened on the corner of Market Street and 14th, in LoDo, Denver

The officer came over to protect the out-cold victim, but a crowd was growing around him.

When he was distracted by the crowd, the officer turned around to see Newton repeatedly hitting the unconscious man around the face with her purse, The Denver Channel said.

Police initially charged the trio with public fighting, but after the medical report of the man's injuries came back, their charges were upgraded, the news service said.

The NY Daily News added that Moore was charged with second-degree assault causing serious bodily injury; and Newton and Warren were each charged with third-degree assault on an at-risk adult.

Moore's bond was set at $10,000, Newton's at $5,000 and Warren's at $2,000.

They are scheduled to appear in Denver County Courtroom August 22 and 23.
