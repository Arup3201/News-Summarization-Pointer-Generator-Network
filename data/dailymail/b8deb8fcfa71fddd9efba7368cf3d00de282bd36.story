A father killed his seven-year-old daughter, girlfriend and girlfriend's mother before turning the gun on himself in a mass shooting at a family home in Queens, New York City, police said.

The sole survivor, his 12-year-old daughter, called police after the attack on Saturday morning - despite having been shot in the head with a bullet through her eye, reports claim.

Kayla Walker, 7, Shantai Hale, 31, and Viola Warren, 62, were found dead at 5.40am inside their Springfield Gardens home after each being shot in the head.

The suspected gunman, 6'6"  nightclub bouncer Jonathon Walker, was later found dead in his car having apparently shot himself in the head.

Tragic: Walker also killed his girlfriend, Kayla's mother, Shantai Hale in the outburst at their home in Queens

According to the New York Post, the surviving child managed to speak to police for 15 minutes despite her critical injuries as she was rushed to Long Island Jewish Medical Center.

Officers then issued an appeal hunting gunman Walker, who was carrying a .45-caliber gun as he drove from the scene of the crime in a 2013 Silver GMC Acadia SUV.

The car and his dead body were found in a wooded area near JFK Airport, the Post reported. 

Walker's girlfriend Shantai Hale, a computer analyst, was found dead in a bedroom with her slain mother Viola Warren, who worked at JFK Airport. 

Seven-year-old Kayla Walker was found in another bedroom. 

New York City Councilman Donovan Richards said Walker was with friends moments before the shooting, and said he was going home to watch Netflix.

'We’ve heard he was out with a friend. He told his friend he was going to get some beers and going home to watch Netflix with the family. We don’t know what made him snap when he came in,' Richards told the Post.

Also killed: Viola Warren, his girlfriend's mother, was also fatally shot in the head in the outburst
