Jurors found Findlay, originally from Blairgowrie, Perthshire, guilty of attempted second degree murder following a two-and-a-half-day trial

A Scottish university lecturer faces 50 years in a U.S. jail for trying to murder her husband after finding his child porn.

Joanna Findlay, 41, blasted Gary Trogdon in the chest at their home in Hollywood, Maryland, but failed to kill him.

Mr Trogdon, a 55-year-old former U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, then took the gun and killed himself.

Jurors at St Mary's County Circuit Court found Findlay, originally from Blairgowrie, Perthshire, guilty of attempted second degree murder following a two-and-a-half-day trial.

Findlay was also found guilty of the statutory firearms offence of using a handgun in the commission of a felony.

State attorney Richard Fritz said Findlay now faces a potential 30 years in jail for attempted second degree murder, and potentially another 20 years on top for the firearms offence.

Mr Fritz said: 'The jury found that she tried to murder him before he shot himself. They decided there was not enough evidence as to whether he committed suicide or she murdered him.

'The jury maybe thought that he committed suicide, but found that she had tried to murder him as well.'

Findlay, who was an English lecturer at Maryland University, insisted throughout that Mr Trogdon had in fact shot himself over the embarrassment at his child porn cache.

Facing jail: Findlay was found guilty of attempted second degree murder after shooting her husband

Joanna Findlay, who studied at Aberdeen 
University and Dundee College, moved to the US 15 years ago on a student
exchange programme. She married Trogdon 11 years ago.

Her parents, Freda and scrap merchant 
Thomas Findlay, of Blairgowrie, Perthshire, are understood to have flown
out to support her.

Freda said last year: 'Joanna is one of the most caring, good-natured people you could meet.'

But Alex Wahlberg, one of Findlay's 
pupils, recalled that Findlay would frequently stop lessons to talk 
about her love of weaponry.

He said: 'A class period didn't go by
that she didn't talk about gun laws or the number of guns she has. She 
would talk about how her house was "a well-armoured home".

'She owned tons of them.'

The trial heard that Mr Trogdon had 
gone to a local support group the morning before he died, after his wife
insisted he seek help for his obsession with child pornography.

Later that day, on October 30 last 
year, the couple were seen in good spirits and had gone to a Mexican 
restaurant in California, Maryland, for dinner with a neighbour after 
helping work on their chicken coop.

However the court heard there was a 
rapid deterioration in their behaviour and later that night Findlay 
tried to overdose on drugs but her husband took them off her.

She claimed in court that he later assaulted her after she again brought up the child pornography.

She said: 'He pushed me down on the bed and he laid on top of me... He wouldn't let me up.'

After more struggling, Findlay said 
she eventually freed herself and took a .22-calibre pistol from a coffee
table drawer in the living room.

She said she shot the gun into the floor to scare him away and then called police.

Mr Fritz, prosecuting, said her 
husband took the gun off her but she then got hold of another pistol, 
this time a .38 calibre weapon, and then shot her husband at close 
range.

Her lawyer, John Ray, said that 
police seized several computers that have thousands of images of child 
porn from a computer owned by Mr Trogdon, who lectured in military 
history.

Officers found 10 guns in total in 
their home, but local medical examiner Dr Ana Rubio said it was 
difficult to say how Mr Trogdon had died.

She said: 'The wound itself allows to be any of those three possibilities - homicide, suicide or accidental.'

Another medical expert, physician Dr Jonathan Arden, concluded that the death was a suicide.

'You could put it in a textbook as an example of a suicidal gunshot wound,' he said.

Findlay had originally faced a charge
of murder in the first degree. If she been found guilty of that, she 
could have become the sixth person to have been executed in Maryland 
since the death penalty was reinstated in the U.S. in 1976.
