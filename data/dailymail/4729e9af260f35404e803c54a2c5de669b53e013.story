Nico Rosberg struck a small psychological blow over rival Lewis Hamilton heading into Saturday's crucial qualifying session after posting the quickest lap in final practice. 

The German, who surely must win on Sunday to stand any chance of claiming his first world championship, was almost four tenths of a second faster than Mercedes team-mate Hamilton.

Felipe Massa, in his Williams, was one second down on Rosberg's best lap with Fernando Alonso in fourth.

Rosberg is 17 points adrift of Hamilton heading into the final race. 

After six consecutive one-two finishes for Mercedes, another will suit Hamilton even if Rosberg takes the chequered flag.

Alonso, in his last race for Ferrari, was fourth quickest, but 1.229secs adrift, followed by the man who will be replacing him next year, in Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel.

McLaren's Jenson Button, potentially competing in his final race as group chief executive Ron Dennis has yet to decide on his driver line-up, was 1.334secs down in sixth.

Daniel Ricciardo in his Red Bull was seventh, followed by Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat, with Kimi Raikkonen in his Ferrari completing the top 10, but 1.614secs down.

At the rear were Caterham duo Kamui Kobayashi and young Briton Will Stevens, the 23-year-old in the car after paying for his seat as part of the crowd-funding project to get the team on the grid, having missed the last two races after going into administration.

Stevens finished 4.535secs behind Rosberg and nine tenths behind team-mate Kobayashi.
