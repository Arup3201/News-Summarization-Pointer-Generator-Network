Arsenal's stars stepped back in time for a special photoshoot recently, donning the red-and-white kit worn by Gunners players way back in 1955.

Theo Walcott, Laurent Koscielny, Mathieu Flamini and David Ospina all took part to celebrate 60 years since the release of Citroen's DS car.

The four players posed with a 1961 DS in their retro strips and the recently released DS 5 in their current kits to commemorate the longevity of Citroen's popular model.

Manager Arsene Wenger even got himself into a picture when he appeared to accidentally photobomb his players as he walked around the club's London Colney training ground. 

The original DS was launched at the Paris Motor Show in 1955, but Arsena's current crop will be hoping for a more successful season than the Gunners squad of 60 years ago.

The north London side finished ninth in Division One in 1954-55, coming below the likes of Portsmouth, Wolves and Aston Villa.

Wenger's men welcome Paul Lambert's side to the Emirates on Sunday looking to force their way back into the Premier League's top four. 

Consecutive wins against Manchester City, Stoke and Hull have strengthened the Gunners' position, meaning just a point could move them back into the Champions League places this weekend.

The FA Cup holders can also look forward to a fifth round tie against Championship outfit Middlesbrough after seeing off Brighton 3-2 at the Amex Stadium on Sunday.
