A teenager has filmed himself experiencing alleged racial discrimination in stores and uploaded the footage online.Â 

'If it keeps happening, I'm going to be forced to record it,' Rashid Polo said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.

A February 27 Vine shows 19-year-old Polo as a white female employee appears to lurk behind him in multiple parts of a convenience store.

Followed? Rashid Polo says his Vines show store employees lurking behind him because they are racially discriminating

'There she goes! She think I'm stealing!' Polo says as the woman appears behind him yet again

'She think I'm stealing, she think I'm stealing, look!' Polo says in the clip as the woman looks at the camera.

A July 15 video shows Polo pursing his lips and shaking his head as a female employee from a different convenience store appears to follow him around inside.

'She been following me around the store the whole time,'he says in the Vine.

When the woman looks at the camera, he says 'There she goes! She thinks I'm stealing!' as she walks away. A video uploaded two days later shows Polo walking inside a convenience store as he says 'Don't you hate when you inside a store and the cashier starts following you?'

'Like, I'm not going to steal all of it, just some of it b****,' he jokes.

'Nobody likes being followed around and it's very uncomfortable,' Polo told The Hollywood Reporter. 'Their reasoning behind it is, 'You're a young minority and you're probably going to steal, so let's keep an eye on you."

'I live in a small town, and I guess that's what happens in town. It's kind of sad, but if it does happen, I'm going to have to keep doing it until it stops. I hope it comes to the point where when I come into a convenience store, it's like, "Oh crap, we're not going to follow you. You're that guy on Vine."'

A request for comment to Polo was not immediately answered.
