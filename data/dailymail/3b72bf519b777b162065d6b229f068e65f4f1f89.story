Michael Schumacher's 15-year-old son is to follow in his father's footsteps after he signed a deal to compete in the Formula 4 series, which nurtures young talents.

Mick Schumacher has been snapped up by the Netherlands' Van Amersfoort Racing team after he finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season.

His father Michael is the most successful driver in Formula One history, with seven titles, but retired from the sport after a devastating ski accident left him in a coma.

Family business: Mick Schumacher, 15, has signed a deal to race for Van Amersfoort Racing in Formula 4

Experience: Mick finished runner-up in the world, European and German kart championship last year 

Champion: Michael Schumacher is the most successful driver in Formula One history, with seven titles

Fritz van Amersfoort, owner of the racing team that bears his name, said of Schumacher Jr, 'we have watched his skills in test driving and are looking forward to a successful season.'

Mick is the first driver named by Van Amersfoort Racing for the 2015 season. The team propelled Max Verstappen - son of Schumacher Sr's 1994 Benetton F1 team-mate Jos - to prominence in Formula 3 last season.

Verstappen Jr, 17, will now race for Toro Rosso in the 2015 F1 season.

'In the last couple of years, it has become a tradition for us that we offer the runner-up from the German junior karting championship a test session in our simulator,' added Mr Van Amesfoort.

'This is handled by the DMSB, the German motorsport authority, and that is how we first got in touch with Mick Schumacher last autumn.

'He spent a full day in the simulator at our headquarters in the Netherlands, then we witnessed him during a test session at Valencia and, eventually, we reached an agreement to compete together in this year's ADAC Formula 4 series.'

17-year-old Verstappen will drive for Toro Rosso in the 2015 F1 season after his prodigious rise 

Announced in 2013 and first run last year, Formula 4 is an open-wheeled motor racing competition designed for junior drivers as a stepping stone to Formula One. Vehicles may have a maximum power output of 160hp and must cost less than €9,500.

There is no global championship, but individual nations can host their own championships according to rules and specifications of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile.

Michael Schumacher suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident in Meribel in the French Alps in December 2013. He emerged from an induced coma in June last year, and left hospital in September.

He has since started to recognise family members, according to someone claiming to be a family friend.

Philippe Streiff, a former Formula One driver, told French media Schumacher 'has yet to recover the power of speech' but is 'nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him'.

And in January a report claimed Schumacher's recovery had reached a point where he now cries when he hears the sound of his children's voices.

According to an article in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra, the fact Schumacher is reacting with tears to his loved ones' voices is 'valuable news', after a year of seeming 'really far away'.

Writing in the paper, Giorgio Terruzi said: 'Schumi cries. And sometimes mysteriously. He cries when he hears his children, his wife's voice, his dogs. In the silence of that room, a tear runs down his thin face at a known sound.'

He added: 'Inside this we can find... There is life, enclosed in a drop; there is the strength of a man who is moved and that moves each of us. We have his tears, his senses exposed.'

However, Schumacher's manager has disputed reports of her client's recovery, saying the 46-year-old faces a 'long fight' for recovery and that Streiff is not a family friend.

'We need a long time,' Sabine Kehm said. 'He is making progress appropriate to the severity of the situation.
