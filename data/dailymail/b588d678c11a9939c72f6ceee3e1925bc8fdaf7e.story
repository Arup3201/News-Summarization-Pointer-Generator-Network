A former community policewoman facing execution for smuggling drugs into Indonesia has revealed how she tried to stop friends and family in Britain discovering she may face the firing squad.

Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday inside one of Indonesia’s toughest jails, Andrea Waldeck, 43, said she had been so appalled at her plight, she could not bear to let loved ones find out.

Only close family members were told of her arrest and many friends only found out the truth when she appeared in court in Indonesia’s second largest city Surabaya last week, where prosecutors announced she faced a possible death penalty.

Waldeck is charged with smuggling 3lb of methamphetamine – known as crystal meth – with a street value of about £100,000 on a flight from China to Surabaya in April.

The former Gloucestershire community policewoman and youth worker once gave teenagers advice on staying away from drugs.

But she is believed to have fallen into the clutches of an international drug-smuggling syndicate after leaving the UK to teach English in China.

In signed statements to police, Waldeck admits smuggling the crystal meth from Guangzhou, China, where she said she was promised £3,100 by a British man she named only as Joe in return for being a mule.

But police were tipped off and put her under surveillance when she arrived alone and checked into Hotel 88 in the city centre on April 28. 

They pounced after she took a call from Joe in China the next day with instructions on who to pass the drugs to.

Officers burst into her room, strip-searched her and found the bags of crystal meth hidden in her bra and underwear and taped to her waist.

Waldeck said she had been desperate to keep her situation secret.

‘It wasn’t too difficult at first because I’d been living in China for a year before this happened,’ she said, speaking in the stifling heat of the visitors’ enclosure at Surabaya’s Medaeng prison.

‘I didn’t want my family and friends to find out what had happened. I didn’t contact them or let them know for a long time. But in the end it had to come out.’

Waldeck said she was already reconciled to the fact she might face the death penalty.

‘I’ve known for some time that the offences I’m charged with carry that sentence so it didn’t come as a surprise when it was raised in court,’ she said.

Asked how she felt about the prospect of death, she smiled and replied: ‘I’m not a conventional person. I can’t say any more about it than that.’ 

Wearing an orange prison jacket over her jeans and polo shirt, Waldeck refused to say whether she will plead guilty, although she insisted the outline of the case presented in court last week was ‘bull****’.

She said she hoped to have an opportunity to speak out in court. Her next appearance is on Tuesday and prosecutors expect her to be convicted and sentenced within two months.

‘I want to write a book about my 
experiences here,’ she said. ‘I don’t want anyone else to have to go 
through what I’ve been through.’ 

After her arrest, Waldeck 
co-operated with police in a double sting, first meeting a contact who 
was arrested as he arrived to collect the drugs from her hotel, and then
flying under police guard with the other suspect to the capital 
Jakarta.

There, on May 2, Waldeck and the other suspect took part in a further sting, meeting another of the drug syndicate’s members in a Jakarta street where he was arrested after they passed the drugs on to him.

Prosecutor Deddy Agus Oktavianto said Waldeck’s co-operation might save her from the firing squad. 

Last month, Indonesia's Supreme Court upheld the death sentence for grandmother Lindsay Sandiford

But her case mirrors that of Lindsay Sandiford, the British grandmother on death row in Bali for smuggling cocaine in 2012, despite co-operating with a police sting.

Waldeck was transferred to  
chronically-overcrowded Medaeng prison a month ago, after spending the 
first four months after her arrest in police cells in Jakarta.

She is the only Western prisoner in Medaeng prison, where she shares a cramped cell with 16 other women.

She seeks solace through the 150-strong Christian community inside the prison, attending services in a church within the grounds. 

‘She comes to church every day and it gives her strength,’ said a Christian guard who has befriended her. ‘Andrea is heartbroken over what her friend in China did to her.’

The suspects arrested in the stings Waldeck helped with – Indonesians Bayu Pracana and Hendrick Lesmana – are awaiting separate trial.

Her mother Sue Barrett, 64, said her family and Waldeck are being helped by the legal action charity Reprieve. When news of Waldeck’s arrest broke last week, friends in England were stunned.

The wife of a police community support officer who worked alongside Waldeck described her an ‘intelligent and conscientious’ woman who devoted her former police career to helping youngsters recognise the dangers of drug use.

Sue Bennett, whose husband Ken regularly patrolled the Cheltenham beat with Waldeck, said: ‘The idea she could be involved in something like this is totally out of character.

'The Andrea we knew went out of her way to help youngsters and actively discouraged them from drugs.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.

While we have referred to Andrea Waldeck as a 'policewoman', we are happy to make clear that she was, in fact, a Community Support Officer (CSO). CSO's were created by the Police Reform Act 2002.
