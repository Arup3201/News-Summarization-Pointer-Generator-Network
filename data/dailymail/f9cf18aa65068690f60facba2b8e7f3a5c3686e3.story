A two-metre stingray weighing more than 100 kilograms has been set free after being trapped for four days in a rock pool south of Sydney.

The large female was released on Wednesday following alleged attempts to gas and even spear the stingray by members of the public to get the animal out of the North Cronulla pool which she became trapped in on Saturday.

Manly Sea Life Sanctuary staff organised the 45-minute rescue, with help from Sea Life Sydney Aquarium and Sutherland Shire Council lifeguards.

Trapping the stingray in the net only took about 10 minutes at the North Cronulla rock pool

The stingray was at least 100kg with six people struggling to lift the animal onto the rock pool edge

The stingray was too large to swim back over the ledge without assistance from the rescuers

Manly Sea Life sciences manager Rob Townsend told MailOnline that although he had conducted similar rescues of stingrays in a rock pool, none had been as large as this one.

‘It would have to be at least 100 kilos because six of us struggled to lift her,’ he said.

The team tried to persuade the creature to swim over the edge of the pool but after numerous attempts it seemed she was too large for the task.

'She was too big to manipulate herself to swim over,' Mr Townsend explained.

The only option left was to capture the stingray in a big net and take over to the pool’s edge.

It was alleged that members of the public attempted to gas and even spear the large female during the four days before she was freed

The stringray needed encouragement by the rescue team to swim off the rock platform

'We waited for large waves and floated her over the crest of the wave,' he said

Mr Townsend said it took another 5-10 minutes to persuade the stingray to swim off the rock platform.

'We had to stand in her way if she was heading in the wrong direction to encourage her to swim further because they have sophisticated sensory organs,' he said.

He heard that there were attempts from members of the public to gas, and even spear the stingray during the four days before she was freed.

'It's not protected species so people are perfectly well within their rights to chop it up for flake although the action is questionable,' he said. 'Setting wild animals free always feels good - its one of the best things we do.'
