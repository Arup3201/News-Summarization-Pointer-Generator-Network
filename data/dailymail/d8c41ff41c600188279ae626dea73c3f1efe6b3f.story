A little boy who completed his bucked list by meeting Gary Barlow and receiving a video message from Dr Who star Matt Smith has died.

Identical twin Jack Robinson, four, from Denmead, Hampshire, died of a brain tumour today.

Jack had a day his family will never forget when the Take That singer Gary Barlow visited him in hospital in February.

Jack (pictured in January) was diagnosed with a brain tumour in January and surgeons tried to remove it but they could not take all of it out so his parents were told it was not curable

Jack also received a comical personal video message from former Dr Who actor Matt Smith, had an early Christmas and birthday party and rode in a fire engine.

The youngster was given only a five per cent chance of survival after surgery to attempt to remove the tumour.

So his heartbroken parents Marie, 41, and Terence, 47, along with sisters Danielle, 21, Christina, 18, Natalie, 14, and identical twin Liam, worked hard to make all his final wishes come true.

Post office supervisor Marie posted on his Facebook page ‘Jack’s Journey’: ‘I am totally speechless, my baby has gone but all I can do is cry.

'We will give my baby an almighty send off, the funeral of all funerals, he deserves the best.’

His sister Natalie added: ‘I just want 
to say a massive thank you to my mum and my dad you made Jack’s months 
happy and cheerful and he wouldn’t of wanted it no other way you two did
 so much and none of us could thank you enough.

Dr Who star Matt Smith sent Jack a personalised video message before he died

‘Jack was an amazing little man, and everyone knows it. As you would say mum he is famous like Gary Barlow.

'But my main point is you two did so much for my brother and even if he was having a bad day you would have got a smile on his face. Well at least he is in peace.’

His other sister, Christina, wrote: ‘Rest in peace 
Jackster, your time has come.

'You fought so well but you could not win! I
 will miss you every day and love you so much, I will cherish every 
moment I had with you, fly high jack.’

Jack (pictured with his identical twin brother, Liam) also rode in a fire engine before he died

Jack was rushed to hospital in January after he became extremely sleepy and one of his pupils enlarged abnormally.

A CT scan revealed a tumour. He underwent a five hour operation to drain fluid from his brain and surgeons removed 40 per cent of the tumour.

Following six agonising days of waiting, specialists concluded the rest of his tumour was inoperable.

He had chemotherapy and radiotherapy but doctors were unable to save him.

Friends and family rallied together and organised fundraisers to raise money to pay for his wishes to be granted.

Jack's mother, Marie, said: 'I am totally speechless, my baby has gone but all I can do is cry, we will give my baby an almighty send off, the funeral of all funerals, he deserves the best.' Image shows Jack, his brother and parents with Fireman Sam
