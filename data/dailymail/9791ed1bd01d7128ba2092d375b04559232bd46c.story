ITV today unveiled a colourful, modern logo as part of a multi-million-pound rebrand - but the design's curvy 'i' and 't' may risk being mistaken for a 'w'.

The broadcaster's new look has been in the works for around a year and will extend across ITV's television channels, website and buildings.

The logo, which was designed in-house, will come into use in January.

The network describes it as 'a warm, bold design based on a formalised version of human handwriting'.

As part of the makeover, its flagship channel - renamed ITV1 in 2001 - will now be known simply as ITV.

Director of Marketing and Research Rufus Radcliffe said: 'In an ever more crowded market place, 
both domestically and internationally, the need for a modern, flexible 
brand identity that connects with our viewers and customers has never 
been more important.

'We are really excited to soon be unveiling a new 
identity that is as up-to-date, and relevant as our content.

'Big, bold 
and creatively ambitious, it will be true to our DNA as a brand at the 
heart of popular culture.'

The way it was: ITV1 was introduced in 2001 - but now the flagship channel will simply be 'ITV'

The revamp of the ITV logo has been ridiculed by viewers who claim the motif looks like a sex toy or a crayon scribbling.

Viewers have voiced their displeasure on Twitter, describing the design as 'super disgusting' and 'hilariously dreadful'.

Famousmales even went as far as congratulating his six-month-old nephew for designing the logo 'using only wax crayons and some sick'.

WelshDalaiLama tweeted: 'This is either the most complicated product you can buy at Ann Summers OR it’s the new ITV logo. Can’t decide which.'

While TheMediaTweets said: 'Leading opinions on ITV logo: 1) It looks like a bum 2) Looks like a kid did it 3) It’s still better than London2012.'

And Mikeshaw10 wrote: 'The new ITV logo looks like something a local charity would use after Debbie in marketing goes on a half-day Photoshop course.'

Twitter users were more critical of the logo today, calling it a 'design disaster'.

Elizabeth Windsor ‏@Queen_UK tweeted:
'Mr Clegg on the phone. Delighted that ITV have adopted the logo he 
designed for them on his etch-a-sketch.'

Simon Usborne ‏@susborne added: 'Hurts the eyes.'

Others called it 'dreadful' and an 'epic fail' - although a handful found the cursive style 'funky' and 'friendly'.

The brand development work is linked 
to ITV’s 'Transformation' plan to overhaul the company and help it 
compete with other broadcasters.

ITV will also introduce a new approach to 
'Idents' – the branded segments between programmes over which announcers 
give information on the schedule.

The idents will now be a revolving 
set of season-specific designs, 'featuring real people, capturing 
moments from everyday life across the UK'.

The
rebrand will stretch across the branding for ITV plc, as well as ITV 
channels and online, and all ITV Studios content and distribution 
businesses, both in the UK, and overseas. ITV News, ITV Sport, ITV 
Player and the website will also be rebranded.

A Radio Times poll surveyed what their readers think about the new look.

A whopping 70 per cent of voters have said they 'dislike it. It looks like a child’s drawing or a backside'.

Just 17.16 per cent said they liked it and 12.54 per cent did not have a strong opinion.

Re-run: The network spent about £1million on developing a new identity with this logo in 1998, promoting it with a series of on-air clips 'to reinforce its re-launch as a brand'

Companies are regularly attacked for rebranding exercises that consumers find bemusing or bizarre.

In 2007 the Olympics organising committee were heavily criticised for the London 2012 logo, with design gurus attacking it as 'confusing' and 'embarrassing'.

The green tree motif introduced by the Tory party in 2006 was derided by both environmentalists and the Conservative old guard for its departure from tradition.

Yell came under fire for rebranding itself as Hibu - pronounced 'high boo' - which even its chief executive admitted meant nothing.
