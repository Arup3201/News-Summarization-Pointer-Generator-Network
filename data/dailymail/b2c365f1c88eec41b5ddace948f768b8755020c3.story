Disgraced running back Adrian Peterson has been credited with the Minnesota Vikings' impressive win at the weekend - despite not even being on the field

Disgraced running back Adrian Peterson has been credited with the Minnesota Vikings' impressive win at the weekend - despite not even being on the field.

The NFL player, who is currently waiting action on child abuse charges  in Texas, sent a text message to coach Mike Zimmer before Sunday's game. 

According to his former teammates, it was Peterson's motivational words  that fired them up to secure an incredible 41-28 win over the Atlanta Falcons.

According to 1500ESPN, Starting quarterback Teddy Bridgewater described the message as 'very deep'.

'One thing that I took away from that message was: 'play each down like it's your last because you never know when it's going to be your last opportunity,' he said. 

'Today I think the guys got that message pretty well. We went out, we fought today and it was just a great overall team effort.'

Vikings running back Matt Asiata did not specify exactly what Peterson wrote, but he did describe the text message as a 'motivational speech'.

'We felt him in spirit,' Asiata said. 'He gave us a text, a motivational speech in a text, and we came out punching.'

The motivation certainly appeared to have worked on Asiata, who scored three touchdowns. The Vikings finished with a season-high 241 rushing yards off Asiata's 78.

Peterson   has been away from the team since September 17, when the Vikings reversed their initial decision to reinstate him following a 60-hour ban. The Vikings could play the rest of 2014 without him.

On September 12, Peterson was indicted in Montgomery County, Texas, for felony injury to a child.

During interviews with Child Protective Services and Texas law enforcement, Peterson admitted to giving his son two spankings, one with a belt and the other with a switch, as 'physical discipline,' according to the complaint. 

Since details of the allegations have emerged, Peterson has been dropped from the Vikings' active roster while the criminal case against him is pending in Texas, where he has an October 8 arraignment.

The Vikings placed Peterson on the 'exempt/commissioner's permission' list, taking him off the roster and bowing to pressure from outraged fans and sponsors. 

The fallout from the abuse allegations have led to major sponsors dropping the NFL star from lucrative endorsement deals. 

Linebacker Gerald Hodges said the text message sent to Zimmer who read it out to the team ahead of the game at the TCF Bank Stadium in Minnesota. 

'[Peterson] just sent it to coach,' Hodges said. 'Him and coach were texting back and [Peterson] said he wanted to share some things. 

'He just said he'd love to be out here, would be dying to be out here with us. But everything's out of his control. He just said go out there and play your hearts out like it's your last time playing.'
