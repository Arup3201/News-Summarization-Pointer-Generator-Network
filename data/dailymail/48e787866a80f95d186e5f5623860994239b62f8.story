Somerset wicketkeeper Craig Kieswetter has confirmed he has had surgery after suffering a serious facial injury while batting against Northamptonshire and is using Hilotherapy to aid his recovery.

Having earlier revealed that he would have surgery, Kieswetter posted a picture on Twitter later on Monday revealing he was using the continuous-flow therapy following the operation.

The former England wicketkeeper tweeted: 'Using @hilotherapy to try help my recovery pre and post op. Definitely pulling the Batman look off..'

Road to recovery: Craig Kieswetter posted this picture after having facial surgery

The 26-year-old sustained a fractured cheekbone and broken nose after being hit by a David Willey bouncer during the opening day of Somerset’s LV= County Championship clash at Wantage Road on Saturday.

Kieswetter, who posted a picture on his Twitter account of the damage caused, with his right eye swollen shut, went to hospital on Sunday for tests where the extent of his injuries were confirmed and on Monday the England limited-overs international gave an update to his situation.

Seeing red: Kieswetter had blood gushing from his right eye following the delivery at the County Ground

Urgent help: Team doctor's from both sides quickly came to the aid of Kieswetter who had to retire hurt

He tweeted: 'Injury update: broken nose and a fractured orbital socket. Surgery is 
required but thankfully no lasting damage to the eye..'

Kieswetter 
was forced to retire against Northamptonshire after a short ball from 
Willey went through the gap above the grill on the batsman’s 
helmet and struck him flush on the right eye.

It is not known how 
long Kieswetter will be absent for, with replacement wicketkeeper Alex 
Barrow taking his place behind the stumps in the current fixture.

He had originally tweeted a picture of the injury accompanied
 with the light-hearted message: 'Apparently chicks dig scars...!? 
#rocky', the picture shows his right eye heavily swollen and cut.

Pitched as a bouncer, Willey's delivery lodged inside Kieswetter's helmet as he mistimed a pull shot.

The
 England one-day and Twenty20 international's injury was so severe that 
he was forced to retire hurt from his innings as blood gushed from his 
face.

Team
 doctors from both counties quickly attended the incident as Kieswetter
 left the field heavily compressing his damaged right eye.

The
 South African-born wicketkeeper had scored 14 runs off 16 minutes in 
the Division One encounter at the County Ground before the painful blow.

After
 winning the toss on Saturday, Somerset elected to bat as they try to 
close the gap on Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire at the top of the table.
