A former union boss scooped a ‘golden goodbye’ of more than £500,000.

Derek Simpson, 66, was the joint general secretary of Unite, Britain’s biggest union, until last year.

Official documents published by Unite reveal the former Communist Party member did not leave empty-handed, despite being a self-styled champion of the common man.

Mr Simpson received an extraordinary £510,659, the equivalent of what an average worker would earn in 20 years.

The majority of the sum – £361,347 – is  severance pay, according to the union’s recently filed ‘annual return’.

It was topped up by his gross salary 
of £97,677 and more than £51,000 in housing benefit and car allowances. 
Dominic Raab, a Tory MP, said: ‘This is the kind of pay-off a banker 
would receive.

‘Hard-pressed members are being fleeced by the caviar communists at the top of the union.’

Sources at Unite say the payout has 
triggered widespread fury among union members, many of whom are 
struggling to make ends meet.

The new boss, Len McCluskey, insisted  yesterday he had not known about Mr  Simpson’s gold-plated departure deal.

In a statement, Unite said the sum 
had been agreed at a meeting of the Amicus General Purposes and Finance 
Committee in March 2008. Mr Simpson left last December.

The statement said Mr McCluskey believed the payment was ‘inappropriate’.

The union decided against legal 
action to claw back some of the money, but it has negotiated a better 
deal on an £800,000 house in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, which it 
provides for Mr Simpson.

He has been paying a rent of just £1 a week, and is entitled to remain in the union-owned property until he dies.

A Unite spokesman said that 
following ‘discussions initiated by the union’, his rent has been 
increased to a level ‘below market rent but above peppercorn rent’.
