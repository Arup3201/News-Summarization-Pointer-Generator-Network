Rio Ferdinand will not be daunted at the prospect of facing old club Manchester United, according to QPR boss Harry Redknapp.

The former Red Devils centre-back faces his former team-mates at Old Trafford on Sunday having joined the Hoops on a free transfer this summer and Redknapp insists Ferdinand will have no problems against his former club.

Speaking to The Sun, Redknapp said: 'Rio will not be fazed by it at all. It will be an emotional day for him of course, he is an absolute legend at that place and rightly so.

'But he is still one of the best defenders in Europe.'

Man United have spent big this summer following last season's disappointing seventh-placed finish and have added Real Madrid winger Angel di Maria and Monaco striker Radamel Falcao to their ranks.

However, Redknapp believes Ferdinand - who spent 12 years at Old Trafford - will have no worries about coming up against United's newest world-class frontman, saying: 'He is a fantastic footballer and facing Falcao will be seen as a challenge, nothing to be frightened of.

Redknapp - who gave a 17-year-old Ferdinand his Premier League debut at West Ham back in 1996 - is adamant the 35-year-old would still get into Man United backline.

'Rio is a top professional and he could still get into the United team, absolutely he could,' said Redknapp.

'I expect he will get a great reception at Old Trafford. The fans are highly knowledgable and do not forget the players who served them well.
