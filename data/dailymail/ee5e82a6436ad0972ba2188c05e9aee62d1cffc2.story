It may have a reputation for being unreliable, but public transport is often the easiest and cheapest way to get around a town or city.

But when you’re in an unfamiliar place, navigating buses, trams and tubes can seem a little daunting.

To make this easier, Google has updated its Maps service to include an extra 17,000 public transport routes around the UK.

National rail data and public transport 
information is already available on Google Maps in cities, including 
London, but this latest update extends it to the rest of the country.

Google Maps for Public Transport now features route details for buses, trains, tubes, trams and ferries.

It shows real-time departures and reveals how many interchanges there will be.

For each journey, the app compares all the available routes via the different transport modes, including walking and driving, to see which is the quickest or easiest.

Alternatively, users can pick their preferred mode of transport, and select the minimum number of changes.

And once a route is selected, Google will tell them which stop they need to get off at, and show the stop on a map.

The changes will be rolled out gradually across Android, iOS and desktop over the coming weeks. This update makes Google Maps similar to other transport apps, including Citymapper. By comparison, Citymapper includes routes and maps for journeys in London, Paris and Berlin and New York

This latest update makes Google Maps similar to other transport apps, including Citymapper.

By comparison, Citymapper includes routes and maps for journeys in London, Paris and Berlin and New York.

Announcing the changes, David Tattersall, product manager for Public Transport in Google Maps said: ‘Starting today, Google Maps for iPhone, Android and desktop shows public transport across Great Britain, creating a comprehensive one-stop-shop for public transport.

‘You can now check the best time and route for millions of departures for trains, tubes, trams, buses and ferries every day.

‘You'll now know when the next trip is departing, how many stops and how far your walk is between each station.’

To make the update possible, Google added schedules from National Express, and partnered with Traveline to collate information from 1,500 local and national operators including Centro and Merseyside.

As part of Google's focus on travel, the search giant recently created an infographic that reveals how technology is influencing the way we explore the world.

According to the graphic, holiday itineraries can be stored in Google Now - from flight details to hotel bookings and trips.

The app also uses 'predictive analytics' to tell users what the weather is like at a destination, show the exchange rate and send an alert when they need to leave for the airport, by analysing public transport departures and traffic.

It's Google Maps app includes 31.8 million miles of road across 198 countries, and features 330,000 hiking paths.

While the Google Translate app offers translation in 80 languages and works with voice search.

In the Future of Travel section, Google claims Glass and other wearable technology will make holiday information accessible without using a phone.

Virtual wallets with spell the end of foreign money and coins, and driverless cars will soon take people to the airport, or on excursions.

The top 10 holidays, based on the most UK searches reveal Turkey will be the destination of choice this year, followed by Greece, Benidorm and Ibiza.

Other destinations to make the list include Portugal, Thailand, New York, Amsterdam, Maldives and Morrocco.
