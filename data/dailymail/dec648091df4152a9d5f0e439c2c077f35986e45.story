This clip shows the moment a Mazda RX8 sports car is completely written off after it smashes into an embankment at 70mph... but miraculously, the driver escaped unscathed.

The accident, captured on dash-cam footage, happened just outside Canterbury on a drizzly, Saturday morning earlier this month.

The driver, who asked not to be named, said he was lucky to be alive when he saw the amount of damage to his car.

A Mazda RX8 sports car was completely written off after it smashes into an embankment at 70mph

The driver, who asked not to be named, said he was lucky to be alive when he saw the  damage to his car

He explained the road had been very wet on November 12 and his car hydroplaned on a patch of standing water which sent it flying into a road sign.

The 38-year-old said: 'I was on my way to Canterbury city centre to pick up a few things and to grab a coffee. 

'Travelling in a straight line in the outside lane, I saw the half mile sign for my turn off, so started to slowly ease into the left lane ready to exit the dual carriageway. 

'All of a sudden, the left wheels of the car hit a lot of standing water that was only in the left lane, jerking the vehicle towards the bank, because of the water, the car just glided like being on black ice.'

He added: 'There was absolutely nothing I could do. 

'I could see the road sign for Canterbury city cathedral looming closer and bigger very quickly as the car almost flew towards it. 

'My thoughts were, this is going to hurt and is not going to end well.'

But after the car crashed into the sign, he says he got out slightly disorientated but without any injuries.

'The car crashed through the sign and amazingly came to a stand still with out going back into the dual carriageway and without hitting or causing any other vehicles to crash,' he said. 

'I got out of the car, without any obvious scratches or pain, slightly disorientated, but breathing a sign of relief, especially when I saw the amount of damage to the car.' 

He added: 'The car was a complete write off - to quote the insurance company's report: "there wasn’t a panel left on the car intact".'
