It has survived a surprise attack, several lengthy sieges and centuries of neglect.

But now neighbours fear that Grade I-listed Warwick Castle will fall to an army of 'glampers' and be transformed into a Disney theme-park version of history.

A planning application to erect 20 'medieval-style' lodges in a 'glamping ground' has been submitted by company which owns the castle, along with Alton Towers, Legoland and Madame Tussauds.

'Glamping' is a more luxurious take on camping and often involves sleeping in beautifully furnished yurts 

Merlin Entertainments also wants to build five large tree houses in the castle's landscaped grounds.

But residents have objected to the latest stage in the 'Disneyfication' of Warwick Castle, saying they fear it will become Butlins-on-Avon.

Veronica Hyland, whose garden backs onto the castle wall, said: 'Warwick Castle is a jewel in the crown of our national treasures, that is visited by people from all over the world, but it is being turned into a Disney-style theme park.'

As one of Warwick's tree wardens, she told the Sunday Times she fears that the tents and lodges will damage roots and the woodland could be lost forever.

'The Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Woodland Trust and the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust are all against it, but the council seems determined it should go ahead,' she said. 

If the plans are approved by Warwick district council at its meeting next month, the holiday village will be built 500 metres south of the castle on a site known as Foxes Study.

Merlin Entertainments' application states: 'The proposed glamping tents will have no significant effect on the character and appearance of the wider or immediate sub-area of the Warwick Conservation area, particularly given the relatively enclosed nature of the application site and given the site is well screened by the existing mature trees, dense foliage and shrubs.'

'Glamping' is a more luxurious take on camping and often involves sleeping in beautifully furnished yurts rather than a two-man tent.

A motte-and-bailey castle was built in 1068 by the Normans following William the Conqueror’s victory in the Battle of Hastings.

By 1260 stone had replaced wood as the Gatehouse, corner defensive posts and the main building (now the site of the house) on the riverside wall of the Courtyard were built.

During the Wars of the Roses, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, imprisoned King Edward IV in Warwick Castle in 1469.

Richard III ordered for two gun towers to be added to Warwick Castle in the 1480s. These were called Bear Tower and Clarence Tower.

During the 16th century, Warwick Castle started to fall into disrepair. In fact, when Queen Elizabeth I visited, a separate building had to be built for her to stay in.

In 1604, Warwick Castle was given to Sir Fulke Greville in 1604 by James I. The Greville family, who owned the property until 1978, set about converting it to magnificent country house.

Royalist forces laid siege to Warwick Castle during the First English Civil War in 1642.

In 1978, the Greville family sold Warwick Castle and it was opened as a tourist attraction.

One of the world’s largest working trebuchets (massive siege catapults) has been built in the grounds of Warwick Castle.

Warwick Castle has had more than 35 different owners since it was built by Henry II.
