Fans stood on walls, climbed floodlight pylons and perched in trees. That was the day 43 years ago when little Hereford United took on mighty Newcastle United in an FA Cup replay.

A young John Motson, on attachment from BBC Radio to television outside broadcasts, made his way from Hereford’s Green Dragon hotel, equidistant from the fine cathedral and the less august Edgar Street ground, for what was expected to be a small end-of-programme clip.

The top-tier deities duly went ahead seven minutes from time through Malcolm Macdonald’s header. But, moments later, Ronnie Radford’s right boot twanged the ball 30 yards into the top corner at the Meadow End for 1-1. It was as sweet a strike as the old Cup has known.

‘What a goal, what a goal,’ exclaimed Motson. ‘Radford the scorer. Ronnie Radford.’ The hero, wearing No 11, reeled away, both hands in the air.

Boys in green parkas and grown men waving black-and-white scarves flooded on to the muddy turf, where, in extra time, substitute Ricky George hit Hereford’s winner low into the far corner. The Southern League no-hopers had done it.

This weekend is FA Cup fifth-round time. But Hereford will not be involved in the Cup or, indeed, any fixture. As of December 19 last year, the club, then playing in the Southern League, was wound up by the High Court in London.

Ninety years of existence in the lower reaches of English football had ended.

Today the Edgar Street ground, in the centre of the city, is a crumbling relic. Addison’s Bar is billed as ‘Open All Day’ but is now closed permanently. The Radford Function Suite is similarly unused.

An A4 piece of paper on the black door under the club badge announces that the ground, as of this month, has returned to its landlords, Herefordshire Council.

With its corrugated fencing and lanky old floodlights, Edgar Street contrasts with the soulless, recently-built shopping centre — comprising Waitrose, TK Maxx and Debenhams — near the site of an old cattle market.

Peering through a gap in the Edgar Street gates is Brett Parker, a former art teacher. He and his wife Julia, from rural Lydbury 40 miles away, were regular visitors here in Hereford’s footballing days.

‘We came for a day out,’ said Parker. ‘I would go to the football and Julia would go to the shops. Then we would meet afterwards at five and go for a curry. What has happened here is bad, sad and mad.’

43 years after their famous FA Cup victory against Newcastle, Hereford went out of business

On December 19 last year, Hereford, then playing in the Southern League, was wound up by the High Court

On the off-white wall at the Meadow End written in red ink and capital letters are the words ‘Lonsdale Out’, which gets us into the nitty-gritty of this sorry tale.

Andy Lonsdale was Hereford United’s last owner. The club was wound up when, despite their lawyers claiming Lonsdale could prove he had £1million to pay creditors led by HMRC, he was unable to get to court because he was supposedly stuck in traffic. 

For all their FA Cup heroics, Hereford United always had less cash than cachet. But while Graham Turner, the long-serving former manager, owned the club he turned a profit through good husbandry. 

Turner sold his majority shareholding to David Keyte, a local businessman, in 2010. From a position of solvency, the club made trading losses of about £1.5m over the next four years. The rot had set in.

Then, last May, Keyte sold to Tommy Agombar, an Essex businessman who was mistrusted by fans as the guardian of a club that is situated on prime city development land. He had a conviction for lorry theft that meant he was later barred under the FA’s owners’ and directors’ test.

Hereford United has gone after 90 years in existence and the gates are locked at Edgar Street

So the club briefly fell into the hands of Alan McCarthy, of Alpha Choice Finance. He was invisible, rarely if ever at games. He was soon succeeded by Agombar’s former adviser Lonsdale, from the construction and waste disposal industries, who had previously been convicted of dumping waste illegally.

By now the club were in a dire mess. Off the field, they were expelled from the Conference for failing to pay a £350,000 bond, while former manager Martin Foyle was suing them for unpaid wages.

On the field, it was mayhem. Unable to play in the Conference, they entered the Southern League for the 2014-15 season, using 46 players in the five months prior to liquidation. Some of the squad came from Spain, France, Georgia, America and Australia, all chasing the dream of a professional football career that was sold to them in an aggressive recruitment drive.

They were paid sometimes as little as £50 or £60 a week, cash in hand. Some even slept in the Starlite function room.

Although North Walian striker Cory Williams, now at Chester City, midfielder Billy Murphy, who joined Bristol City, and local boy Jarrod Bowen, who moved to Hull City, found a life in football beyond Hereford, many more players disappeared into the ether as quickly as they had appeared from nowhere.

So what next? Herefordshire Council, themselves in debt, are committed — at least until the elections in May — to trying to resurrect the club at Edgar Street.

They have ‘invited expressions of interest’ to take on the tenancy, albeit only for two and a half years.

The deadline for bidders is next Thursday, with the Council due to select who takes over the ground by March 1, the FA’s deadline for participation next season.

Rumours in Hereford say there could be three bidders, though only one is in the open: a 50-50 split between the Supporters’ Trust and a group of local businessman led by Jon Hale, who made his money from polythene plant pots.

Hale and his group say they are ready to commit £150,000. The Trust, whose membership of 1,700 makes their backing crucial to any bid prospering, have about £30,000 in the bank but say they could quickly raise more funds if the Council chooses them. Martin Watson, the Trust’s vice-chairman, said: ‘We are glad the last owners have gone. We don’t see it as the end for football in Hereford.’

If the bruised supporters should succeed with a phoenix club, it will be called plain Hereford Football Club and probably rejoin in the fifth tier of non-League football, the Midland Premier League.

‘A lot of work needs to be done, but we are confident we can do it,’ said Watson.

He and fellow fans can take inspiration from the old club’s motto: ‘Our greatest glory lies not in never having fallen, but in rising when we fall.’
