He was enjoying a romantic dinner with his wife - but the mood was quickly shattered upon his discovery of a huge bug in his Marks & Spencer creamed spinach.

Danny Grace, 33, cooked up some steaks with a £2.50 portion of spinach - but while eating it he felt a crunch between his teeth, before spitting out the mouthful and vomiting on the floor.

The company managing director, who bought the food from an M&S store near his home in Islington, north London, complained and was sent a bottle of fizzy wine and £25 compensation.

Shocked: Danny Grace, pictured with his wife Corinne, said that he has since become obsessive about food

Mr Grace is convinced the bug was a cockroach - but M&S insists that an investigation found this was incorrect, and confirmed it was a moth.

He said: ‘It still makes me feel sick thinking about it. I felt like I was on I'm a Celeb. You don't expect this from Marks and Spencer. I know what I crunched and what I saw, and it was a cockroach.

‘It's outrageous that's all the compensation I've been given. I've given the voucher away because I never want to shop there again.They could at least have pushed the boat out and sent champagne.’

Mr Grace said that since the incident in October, he has become obsessive about food. He refuses to eat outside and watches his wife Corinne cooking to make sure no bugs get into his meals.

He also sifts through his dishes with a fork for five minutes before eating and avoids pre-packaged vegetables.

Mrs Grace said: ‘He's driving me mad. When I try and cook he's leaning over me watching my every move.

‘If he sees something he thinks looks odd it puts him off and he won't finish the rest of the meal. That cockroach has a lot to answer for.’

An M&S spokesman said: ‘We were sorry to hear about Mr Grace's complaint. Quality is extremely important to us and we've been working with our supplier to investigate what happened.

‘Our investigation has found it was not a cockroach and we have kept Mr Grace updated with our findings, as well as sending him a goodwill gesture along with our apologises.’
