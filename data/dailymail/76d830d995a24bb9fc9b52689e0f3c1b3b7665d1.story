Benefits cheat: Debra Allan, who was jailed for fleecing £103,000 from the taxpayer

A jet-setting mother who pocketed more than £100,000 in state handouts by claiming she could barely walk yet still flew around the world was jailed today.

Former hairdresser Debra Allan, 49, 
ripped off the taxpayer by squandering her welfare cash on holidays to 
Dubai, Laos and Thailand. In one year alone, the benefits cheat enjoyed five months in Italy.

Allan had claimed her husband Michael 
was her sole carer and that it took her 15 minutes to walk 30m - saying 
she needed help getting out of bed, to go to the toilet, someone to cook
for her and to help her take medication.

She also claimed she needed a mobility scooter, or her husband would 'push her in a wheelchair', he added.

But holiday snaps showed Allan using a treadmill in Dubai going on a giant water slide and going down another on a surf board.

Inquiries revealed her husband was in fact a construction engineer earning £72,000-a-year in the Far East.

DWP
officials also captured Allan as she walked her Westland Highland 
terriers near her home at Leasowe on the Wirral and bending down without
difficulty.

A total of 
£110,693.44 of income support allowance, carer's allowance, employment 
support allowance, council tax benefit and disability allowance was 
illegally claimed between June 2004 and January 2010.

At Liverpool Crown Court mother-of-three Allan was jailed for 18 months after she admitted benefit fraud offences.

The court heard Allan who has three children from her first marriage - two sons, aged 27 and 29 and a daughter, 21 - made claims after being diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2003, which resulted in her having to undergo a full hysterectomy that year.

Her husband Michael Allan, with whom she has since separated, claimed income support saying that neither he, nor the defendant was working. He had been made redundant earlier that year, so they were entitled to this and the tax benefits they received.

Mrs Allan also claimed disability allowance, which was legitimate at first, and her husband received carer's allowance for looking after her.

Mr Kevin Slack, prosecuting, said the 
fraud began in June 2004 when Mr Allan got a construction job in Italy -
and failed to notify the DWP.

A letter was written to the DWP asking for the money to be put into a post office account.

Allan then continued her walk completely untroubled in front of the camera. She got an 18 month sentence for committing benefit fraud

'The nominated account was one in the name of the defendant. Over the next three-and-a-half years more than £50,000 was put into that Post office account.

'She dishonestly retained those monies
that had been improperly paid into this. She failed to notify the DWP 
of the change in circumstances.'

In
2005, Mr Allan then went to work on constructing terminal three at 
Dubai airport and in early 2007, he was based in Qatar, before moving to
Laos in the far east where he received a monthly salary of around 
£6,000.

'He was supporting the defendant, yet she continued to claim income support on the basis that the family had no income', said Mr Slack.

He said Allan's diary from 2005 had been seized and it revealed she had spent 156 days in Italy during 2005. The LEA were made aware that her daughter had been placed in alternative care - staying with her grandmother.

In April 2007 a carer review form was completed in the name of Michael Allan, but the handwriting suggested it was the defendant who had filled it out. 'She now accepts that was a false claim', he said.

Mr Slack said there had been a substantial improvement in Allan's mobility and her need of care by March 2006 - and photographs showing her using a treadmill in Dubai, where she enjoyed several trips, proved this.

On her return from visiting Dubai, the claimant filled out a disability review form, stating her husband was her sole carer and that it took her 15 minutes to walk 30 metres.

'She stated she needed someone with her when outdoors, she needed a mobility scooter, or her husband would push her in a wheelchair', he added.

The defendant also claimed on the form, received in July 2006, she needed help getting out of bed, to go to the toilet, someone to cook for her and to help her take medication.

He said: 'It was a complete fabrication. Her husband was in no position to provide such care because he was working abroad.'

Other holiday snaps taken later that year in Dubai, showed the defendant going on a giant water slide and going down another on a surf board.

When the DWP grew suspicious in January 2008 and attempted to contact Michael Allan at his home address, Mrs Allan called to say her husband had started to work abroad and did no longer needed the income support benefit.

She then got her daughter, who was 17 at the time, to submit a carer's allowance form, even though later that year Allan was able to travel to Laos and Thailand.

In February 2009 she claimed for employment and support allowance saying she had separated from her husband and had no idea where he was and she had no income of her own.

Her husband was still working in Laos on around £7,000 a month before tax and he was still supporting her.

An investigation launched in 2009 by the DWP caught the defendant out walking her dogs, carrying a vacuum, doing her shopping unaided and revealed she was a member at a gym and leisure centre.

Mr John O'Leary, defending, said Allan had come from an unhappy and abusive marriage before she met Michael in 1996, who she married in 2000.

Her marriage to Michael was not easy because of the strained relationship he had with her two sons. She was subjected to emotional abuse during this time.

He said prior to her diagnosis she led an active life, with her own hairdressers and lectured part-time at a college. He said: 'She had hoped of becoming a successful business woman.'

But her life dramatically changed after diagnosis, after which she also had to deal with the death of her parents. He said the defendant turned to drink at times of economic difficulty and she became aware of her husband, who now suffers a malignant brain tumour, was having affairs with other women, which encouraged her to visit him.

'She does not in any way wish to portion blame, she accepts the full scale of her offending. She has accepted that what she has done has been fundamentally dishonest. She knows that there are no excuses', he said.

The court heard Allan's husband was not before the court because he was suffering from a brain tumour.

Judge David Aubrey said: 'These offences are so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence is justified. You were defrauding the department, the tax payer and the public for a considerable duration of time.

'Your dishonesty and the extent of your dishonesty - it was blatant through and through. Your mobility improved considerably. Your mobility was not restricted to a scooter or a wheelchair - your mobility included using a giant water slide and running on a treadmill and considerable activity such as that.'

And he said she was travelling to Italy, Dubai, Laos and Thailand during this period - the costs being footed by the tax payer. And the judge did not deem the exotic trips to be taken for the sole purpose of seeing her husband.

'You were travelling to those destinations because you were enjoying the life abroad. You were being dishonest for one purpose and one purpose alone, that was to receive monies that you knew you were not entitled to.'
