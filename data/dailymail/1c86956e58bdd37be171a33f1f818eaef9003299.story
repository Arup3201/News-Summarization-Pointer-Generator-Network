From doing the school run to cleaning up after the children, most parents simply don’t have time for spontaneous romance.

So much so that six in ten of them say they have to pre-arrange those intimate moments between the sheets. 

A third only managed to have sex once a week, while a quarter of shattered parents do it once a month or less.

‘Scheduled sex’ is one of the top parenting trends of this year, according to Netmums.

A poll by the website found a third of British parents managed to make love only  once a week, while a quarter did it once a month or less.

Netmums co-founder Siobhan Freegard  said: ‘Spontaneity is lovely when you have time for it, but people are realising that actually if you wait for the moment, it  will probably never come.

'The general  consensus is that it is worth making the effort even if you don’t feel like it.’

Top of the list of new parenting trends is ‘cake-smashing’, in which mothers and fathers ditch photos of their newborns in favour of professional shots of the child tucking into his or her first birthday cake.

Also featured were labour playlists, with 16 per cent of mothers-to-be taking their own tunes into the delivery room to help soothe the pain of childbirth.

Tech-savvy mums are also sharing the 
playlists online, with top relaxing tracks including 19 by Adele and 
Beautiful Day by Elbow.

With eight in ten mothers breastfeeding their child, there has also been a boom in wacky mementos – with some even having their milk solidified and made into a ring.

On a more traditional note, the poll found three quarters of new mothers had been given jewellery by their partners, who shell out an average of £100 a time.

As storms have battered Britain recently, cautious parents have gone back to the Seventies and prepared power cut kits (one in eight) filled with blankets, tea lights and torches, while a further one in ten have created a list of games if the telly cuts out.

And with energy costs more than doubling over the last decade, a thrifty one in ten families now use candles to cut back on their bills.

But while finances may be tight, a whopping 95 per cent of mums are going without clothes, make up or even food to make sure their little ones are taken care of.

The pricey trend has led to an expansion in sales of children’s clothes, apps and days out dubbed the ‘KiddyConomy’, Netmums say.

As technology advances, parents are actually ditching Facebook this year, with 62 per cent reducing the time they spend on the social networking site and seven per cent logged off completely.

Another trend for the new year is extreme tutoring, with parents heaping more pressure on their kids to study as competition for the top state school places rises.

Half of parents have considered private tuition and 15 per cent are already paying for it, while shockingly 16 per cent get their kids tutoured before they even begin school.

Round up the top ten trends is sibling birthday gifts, where more than a quarter of mums splash out on presents for the whole family on a child’s special day to stop everyone feeling left out - and to teach kids not every event is about them.

Ms Freegard said: 'Every family wants the best for their child - but there are very different views on what this means and how to achieve it.

'As this year’s top parenting trends show, mums and dads are doing their best to give their kids a great childhood despite a lack of time and money.'
