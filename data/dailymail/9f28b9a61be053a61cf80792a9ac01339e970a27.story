U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder took to ABC's 'This Week' Sunday morning to blast conservative personality and former Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, in response to her editorial calling for the impeachment of President Obama.

'She wasn't a particularly good vice presidential candidate' said Holder on the political talk show, speaking to host George Stephanopoulos.  'She's an even worse judge of who ought to be impeached and why.'

Holder's comments were responses to an editorial written by Palin and published last week on Breitbart.com, entitled 'It's Time to Impeach President Obama.'

US Attorney General Eric Holder (pictured left) took aim at a recent op-ed by Sarah Palin (pictured right), in which the conservative personality advocated for the impeachment of President Obama

Palin's article asserts that Obama is purposefully weakening the border security between the United States and Mexico, and declares it grounds for impeachment proceedings to begin.

'Enough is enough of the years of abuse from this president,' she opened her op-ed with. 'His unsecured border crisis is the last straw that makes the battered wife say, "no mas.”'

Holder responded with disdain for Palin's criticisms, also denouncing 'gridlocked Washington' and the Republican Party's continuing efforts to block any initiatives from the Obama Administration. 

'For whatever reason, [some] Republicans decided early on that this was a
 president they were just simply not going to cooperate with,' Holder told ABC News' Pierre Thomas in a rare interview. 'And over the 
past five-and-a-half years, we have seen demonstrations of that, where 
the president has reached out his hand, offered compromises that have 
simply not been met [in the way] they have been in the past by a 
Republican Party willing to do the appropriate things.'

Holder on ABC's 'This Week,' where he also criticized the Republican lawsuit against Obamacare and defended himself against accusations that he should be impeached for declining to appoint a special prosecutor to handle investigation of the IRS scandal

Holder also dismissed calls for himself to be impeached due to declining to appoint a special prosecutor to deal with the latest IRS scandal involving former executive Lois Lerner and allegations of  targeting of conservative politicians and covering it up.

Holder insisted that hiring a special prosecutor was not necessary, and FBI agents investigating the allegations were 'doing a good, professional job.'

In Palins op-ed, she claimed that a lax approach by Obama in the enforcement of border security is allowing illegal immigrants to flood the country and irreparably damage the middle class by adding an undue burden on various American resources.

Palin also warned that without action now, Obama's 'lawlessness' would worsen.

'It’s not going to get better, and in fact irreparable harm can be done 
in this lame-duck term as he continues to make up his own laws as he 
goes along, and, mark my words, will next meddle in the U.S. Court 
System with appointments that will forever change the basic 
interpretation of our Constitution’s role in protecting our rights.'

She concluded her op-ed with 'The many impeachable offenses of Barack Obama can no longer be ignored. If after all this he’s not impeachable, then no one is.'

In the ABC interview, Holder commented that he believed that some level of racism was involved with the cries of Republicans to impeach both himself and Obama.

Holder contended that the criticisms of himself and Obama (pictured) have some basis in 'racial animus'

'There's a certain level of vehemence, it seems to me, that's directed 
at me [and] directed at the president,' Holder said. 'You know, people 
talking about taking their country back. … There's a certain racial 
component to this for some people. I don’t think this is the thing that 
is a main driver, but for some there's a racial animus.'

House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and other Republican leaders have said that they do not support calls for Obama's impeachment. Boehner does support a lawsuit filed against the Affordable Care Act, which Holder also lambasted in his interview.

'It's a more, I think, a political gesture than a truly legal one,' Holder 
said. 'Filing a lawsuit against the president that has no basis is not 
going to improve the quality of life for the American people.'
