Two hosts on NBC's Today Show learned why drinking alcohol on air may not be the wisest idea.

Natalie Morales and Lester Holt took shots of Vodka on Television in Sochi on Sunday and they paid the price.

Vodka, a popular drink among Russians, induced coughing for the American television hosts who had to cut to a commercial break almost immediately after downing shots.

The Huffington Post reports that Morales doesn't consume vodka on a regular basis but that she wanted to be festive for the Russian Olympics.

Holt told Morales that the real way to consume vodka in Russia is to 'pound it down.'

'So you're going to pound it down?' Morales asked Holt.

'I don't know, I'm asking you,' Holt replied.

'Well, apparently the manly thing to do is to pound it down,' Morales said.

While Russians may 'pound down' shots of Vodka, they seldom drink without food, reports Ask Men. The tradition called Zavuski includes drinking shots with a large array of foods such as blinis, fish, pickles, apples, or even wedding cake.

The food is used to help mitigate the taste of the Vodka and also to keep the drinker from becoming too drunk.

Next time, the TV hosts might consider eating food with their shots, or just not take them for all of their audience to see.
