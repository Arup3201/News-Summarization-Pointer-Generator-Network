Georgia boss Temuri Ketsbaia vowed to puncture Scottish over-confidence after accusing his Euro 2016 rivals of writing off Saturday evening’s opponents at Ibrox.

And the former Dundee midfielder insists that all the pressure will be on the hosts — and not him despite the opening loss at home to Ireland. 

Ketsbaia said: ‘If they feel confident, that’s their problem, not our problem. You don’t always get what you expect. Sometimes, things don’t go as you would like – especially when somebody is not expecting you to be so tough.

‘The only thing you can do is go out and show them, prove them wrong. That’s what I expect from my players.

‘We’ve been written off from the beginning by Scotland, because they said the only teams who will not play for the finals is going to be Georgia and Gibraltar.

‘OK, that’s their opinion. The only thing we have to do is do our job, do our best and hopefully get the result.

‘Scotland have good players and they have fighters. But they also know they can play very well.

‘They are not Brazilian - but they are good players and that’s why they are playing at a high level.

‘Of course the pressure is on Scotland. They are expected to win, especially when their target is to quality.

‘I am surprised at the confidence of Scotland. They haven’t qualified for 16 years and that’s a long time.’

Of his own future, Ketsbaia added: ‘I said after the Ireland game, when we lost, that if we didn’t get the results in the next two games, maybe it would be time for me to go.

‘But I didn’t feel pressure. Nobody has told me that this is my last game. You are always under pressure as a coach. Especially for us because, for five years now, most of the games we’ve played are against teams who are much better than us. But we’re not easy to beat.’
