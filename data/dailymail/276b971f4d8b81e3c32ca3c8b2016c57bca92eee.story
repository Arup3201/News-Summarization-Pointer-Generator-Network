Reforms: Justice minister Damian Green

Magsitrates are to be given the power to overrule police officers who give ‘soft’ spot-fines and cautions to violent thugs and thieves.

The ‘scrutiny’ powers will allow victims to challenge officers who let criminals off with out-of-court penalties.

It could result in offenders who were originally handed a caution or other penalty being called to court to receive a tougher sentence.

Justice Minister Damian Green will announce the reforms today as part of a speech on criminal justice.

He will say: ‘There is definitely a place for out-of-court disposals in ensuring justice is brought in cases which may otherwise not have come to court and as a proportionate response to some low-level offending.

‘But we need to make sure that it is only these cases which are getting out-of-court disposals, and that all cases which should properly be brought before a court are brought to court.’

The use of cautions is currently the subject of a major review ordered by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, which is expected to report within weeks.

Huge disparities between forces in how cautions are used have raised concerns about ‘postcode justice’.

Overall, the police handed out 205,700 cautions in the year to September 2012, according to the latest Ministry of Justice figures.

More than ten per cent were for violent attacks, one in three were for theft and handling stolen goods, and a third were for drug offences.

Tens of thousands more are dealt with using only ‘restorative justice’ programmes, which critics say amount to little more than an apology.

The new measure is likely to appeal to shopkeepers infuriated by failures to prosecute thieves who are let off with an £80 spot-fine.

It could also be used by those who confront drunken yobs only to see them avoid going to court.The plan is part of a wider move to redefine magistrates’ responsibilities. Mr Green will warn that thousands of cases they could deal with end up in the crown court unnecessarily.

Some 4,000 offenders sent before a crown court were given a sentence of six months in prison or less – which magistrates could have dispensed.

But Mr Green will say that the Government needs ‘to get the balance right at the lower end of the spectrum as well’. He will float plans to take thousands of low-level driving offences out of the courtroom.

Instead of facing a full hearing before a panel of three magistrates, those who jump red lights, drive without valid documents or commit parking offences would be dealt with by a single magistrate ‘sitting in an office’.

The new process would apply only in cases where the driver pleaded guilty – around nine in ten of the half-million such cases handled annually by the courts.

Mr Green will say: ‘The time magistrates spend in court should be focused on those cases where they make a real difference to their communities.

‘Their core skills of deciding on bail, fact-finding and sentencing should be put to best effect.’
