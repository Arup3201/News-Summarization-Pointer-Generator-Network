The continuing storm over City bonuses is damaging Britain's reputation as a place to do business, a group of leading international bankers has warned.

Government ministers have been accused of trying to gain public favour this week by stripping former RBS chief Fred Goodwin of his knighthood and pressurising current RBS chief executive Stephen Hester to reject a £1 million bonus.

One senior executive at a Wall Street bank told The Times: 'London is now the worst major centre in the world to do banking.'

The City under attack: Could government pressure on financial institutions drive them out of the City of London for good?

The anti-banking bandwagon is only set to worsen in the next few days with the bonus announcement of Bob Diamond, Barclays chief executive.

Directors of privately-owned banks are concerned public pressure will be put on them to reduce or reject annual bonuses in the light of Mr Hester's decision to waive a bonus this week.

Investment banker Nicola Horlick, a university friend of Mr Hester has warned against a 'witchhunt' towards bankers.

'You shouldn't underestimate the importance of financial services to the country,' she told The Times. 'Without it we would be in dire straits. Let's not kill the golden goose that saved the country.

She said it was short-sighted to demonise Mr Hester when he was trying to raise the share price so the public could get its money back.

Mr Hester, chief executive of the 82 per cent publicly-owned Royal Bank of Scotland was the subject of sustained calls from government ministers and Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, to relinquish a bonus at such a politically-sensitive time.

Several top banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered are concerned that attacks on bonuses will cause shareholders to push from a move away from the UK so they can still attract the best staff, who may be put off the UK by any blocks on windfalls.

Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS told The Times the government and others had embarked on an anti-business bandwagon.

'Bashing people who are actually there 
to help, doesn't itself help. We knew there would be a reaction..but the
scale of it took us by surprise. I think it took the Government by 
surprise too.'

A senior banker then compared David 
Cameron and George Osborne to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by having one 
opinion out of the gaze of the public and another in front of the 
cameras.

'They come out 
with all the right language to us in private.  But they can't resist the
call of the mob. Has this reduced our respect for the coalition? The 
answer without a shadow of a doubt is yes.'

Ed
Miliband and David Cameron have both given speeches in the last week 
criticising high City bonuses, with Mr Miliband trying to get the House 
of Commons to vote on Tuesday to end 'bonus culture'.

Stuart Popham, head of pro-banking 
group TheCityUK, is worried the attacks will drive a rift between the 
financial world and the government, which is a vital relationship when 
the economy is struggling.

The
fear is that banks will leave the City of London altogether, in favour 
of more favourable treatment in Asia or America.  A move which would be 
catastrophic for the UK economy in terms of jobs and investment.

Will he or won't he? The decision of Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond to take a bonus or not this year will have a huge bearing on the rest of the banking industry

The financial services industry accounts for 8.9 per cent of the total output of the UK, and contributes 2.8 per cent of GDP.

The
Conservative Party is having to tread a fine line on this issue as it 
has always traditionally been seen as pro-business, and relies on the 
City for a large chuck of its funding.

In 2011 more than half of the £12.2 million donated to the party came from donors linked to the City.

Many supporters of the party are now calling for a softening in the criticism of banking practices.
