The firing squad might have stepped down following the welcome return to form of England captain Alastair Cook at the Ageas Bowl but the camp still have close connections with a cricket axing this week.

Oliver Robinson, the 20-year-old stepson of England assistant coach Paul Farbrace, has been sacked by Yorkshire for disciplinary reasons.

Seam bowler Robinson, who has played seven T20 Blast matches this season, is highly-rated by Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie.

But the county have become exasperated by his lack of professionalism, with his crime sheet including turning up late, misleading the club over where he had been and not travelling to matches with the rest of the team.

A club statement said: ‘Oliver Robinson’s contract has been terminated with immediate effect due to a number of unprofessional actions.’

Farbrace, married to Robinson’s mother Sandra, relocated from Kent to Yorkshire when he was appointed their second XI coach two years ago, and Robinson soon worked his way on to the playing staff at Headingley.

Yorkshire believe Robinson will soon find another county.

Divided: Opinion is split on Tom Daley's boyfriend

Opinion is split within swimming about the influence on Tom Daley from his American showbiz partner Dustin Lance Black.

Some frowned on Black being with Daley on a flight back from Shanghai after the World Cup, believing the divers should travel as a team.

Others see Hollywood scriptwriter Black as a force for good, who is fully supportive of Daley’s ambitions to compete at Rio 2016 and has moved to Stratford to be with him for most of the year, even if it means writing his scripts using the kitchen table.

Sky Sports
 have revealed their obsession about the threat from BT Sport with the 
new marketing slogan for their Premier League coverage: ‘More of the 
games that matter.’

Sky subscribers would expect every game to matter after increases to their monthly bill.

Meanwhile,
 after spending millions on 3D football, Sky have gone quiet on how many
 games — if any — will be shown on the platform in 2015-16 before the 
project is written off.

The Commonwealth Games Federation paraded mascot Clyde at their daily media briefing to celebrate his sell-out commercial success.

In the top 10 items sold at the Games, there is — surprise, surprise — no mention of scarves.

Please note Andy Hunt, special advisor to Team England.

Most of former British Olympic Association chief Hunt’s Team GB scarves for the home Olympics are rotting in a warehouse somewhere.

Guest list or pest list?

Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove could not have picked three people more likely to antagonise the ECB to invite for meals or welcome as house guests during the third Test.

The trio are Shane Warne, who has done his best to destabilise the England team; India coach  Duncan Fletcher, still remarkably bitter over his sacking as England coach in 2007, and the risible, unemployable Piers Morgan.

Risible: Piers Morgan has taken to posting banal barbs at Sports Agenda to his 4.2million Twitter followers

After being sacked by the Daily Mirror and CNN, Morgan has taken to posting banal barbs at Sports Agenda using his ‘me me me’ Twitter account, which has nowhere near the combined reach of the Daily Mail and MailOnline.

Hull City will only be able to use 19 players in the Europa League instead of the limit of 25 because of an appalling record in producing homegrown footballers, who must form part of the squad. Hull haven’t had a local talent make more than 20 appearances in a season for 14 years. Boss Steve Bruce has demanded the club prioritise an academy upgrade.

Sergey Bubka, the Ukrainian pole-vault legend challenging Lord Coe for the presidency of athletics ruling body the IAAF next year, surprisingly chose to host a press briefing in Glasgow on Coe’s UK territory.

However, the event was cancelled at the last minute because Bubka, who is paying only a fleeting visit to the Commonwealth Games, was double booked.

Certainly he would have found questions about his role in the overthrown Ukrainian government very uncomfortable.
