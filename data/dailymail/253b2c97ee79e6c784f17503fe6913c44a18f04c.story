A financial whiz who combined a successful City career with raising her six children has blamed exhausted stay-at-home mothers who prefer to stay in at night for the failure of her first restaurant

Fund manager Nicola Horlick says she had to close Georgina's, her bistro in Barnes, south west London, after 18 months because the area was 'full of mothers with children who don't go out much at night'.

The 53-year-old multi-millionaire, who named the business after her eldest daughter who died of leukaemia in 1998, says she wasn't making a profit because the restaurant wasn't doing enough trade at night.

She also cited 'outrageous' business rates in the smart suburb for the restaurant's failure and blamed local estate agents for pushing them up.

Closed after 18 months: Horlick named her restaurant after her eldest daughter, who died of leukaemia

Horlick said that while her cream-painted canteen did a roaring lunchtime trade, it was not doing enough covers in the evenings to make money.

'I have learnt a lot of lessons,' she said.  'The problem is Barnes if full of mothers with children who don't go out much at night.

'So although we were doing 200 lunches on a Saturday and breaking even, I need to give a proper return to shareholders.'

Horlick is now planning to try again in nearby Chiswick, where - although it, too, is home to a large population of 'yummy mummies' - she believes she has found more suitable premises.

She intends to be open in time for Valentine's Day and says she has six chefs and six front-of-house staff already lined up.

She launched Georgina's after having the 
idea for it while sitting on her sick daughter's bed discussing her 
favourite foods while she was being treated at Great Ormond Street 
Hospital in 1998.

When she launched it in spring 2012, Horlick said she intended to fill a hole in the market by offering good food at breakfast and lunchtimes, as well as dinner in the evenings.

She told bighospitality.co.uk: 'There will be amazing homemade granolas and yogurts in the morning and then fantastic salads at lunchtime but a full service dinner in the evening.

'A lot of restaurants in London do very, very little trade at lunchtime and don't do any breakfast or teatime trade and that is actually rather a waste when costs are so incredibly high.'

She added: 'I wouldn't do it unless I thought it was a good business proposition because there is no point otherwise.'

Georgina's was well-received by diners in Barnes, who wrote enthusiastic reviews on the TopTable website.

'Went
 here for dinner and the food was amazing!', wrote one.  'Really liked 
the decor too, simplistic but stylish -  would definitely return and try
 the brunch that I've heard is yummy.'

Another wrote: 'A really good spot for a light, healthy lunch.  Highly recommended.'

Born in December 1960 to Michael Gayford and his Polish wife, Suzanna, Nicola was educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College and Birkenhead High School before studying law at Oxford.

In 1983 she joined SG Warburg as a graduate trainee, and rose to director level before joining Morgan Grenfell Asset Management nine years later.

Meanwhile, she had married financier Tim Horlick in 1984, an old friend from Oxford, and had her first child, Georgina, in 1986.

Horlick brought the Midas touch to Morgan Grenfell, turning the company upside-down, dramatically increasing its profits, and earning herself £1.5million a year - a vast sum 16 years ago - for her work.

When Morgan Grenfell sacked Horlick, she flew to their Frankfurt HQ - with 40 journalists in tow - to ask why

But it was in 1997 that she earned herself the 'Superwoman' tag when, after being sacked from Morgan Grenfell, she summoned a pack of 40 journalists and flew with them to the company's Frankfurt offices to demand her job back.

At 36, she already had five children, one of whom was seriously ill, to cope with alongside her high-powered job, but the country was entranced by the supermother who wouldn't take no for an answer.

Ultimately, though, she did, and went off alone, setting up SG Asset Management in 1997, the year before her daughter died of leukaemia, and then Bramdean Asset Management in 2005.

In 2005 Horlick got divorced and met journalist Martin Baker, when he came to interview her for the Sunday Telegraph.  She and Baker married the following year, and they live together in Barnes.

After her first marriage ended in divorce, Horlick found love with newspaper journalist Martin Baker

Horlick's independent career appeared to be coasting when, in 2008, she lost £12million of investors' money to fraudster Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scam.

Since then, she has launched the Rockpool investment company, gone into film production with Derby Street films, and joined the board of an NHS trust.

Two months ago she announced plans to launch a crowdfunding venture, a website called Money&Co, in early 2014.

Horlick
 said the site would allow investors to make loans available to 
fledgling businesses, which would be repaid with a profit if the venture
 were a success.
