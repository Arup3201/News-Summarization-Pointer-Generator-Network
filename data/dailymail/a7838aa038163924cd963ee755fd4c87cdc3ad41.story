It started out as a small drapers shop on London’s Oxford Street in 1864.

But 150 years’ later, John Lewis has become Britain’s favourite retailer inspiring ‘exceptionally high loyalty’ among its army of devoted shoppers.

Yesterday the retail analysts Verdict said John Lewis, which has annual sales of around £4billion a year, won first prize in its annual competition to find ‘the nation’s best retailer'.

The announcement was not entirely surprising. Verdict has held the competition for the last 15 years - and John Lewis has come top ten times.

And when it does not come top, it comes second (except for one shaming occasion in 2012 when it came third).

Sarah Peters, an analyst at Verdict, said: ‘As Britain’s favourite retailer, John Lewis continues to deliver the product ranges, inspiration and trust that customers appreciate.’

There are just 41 John Lewis department stores in the UK.

When the most recent one opened in York two weeks ago, there were 150 people queuing outside at 8.30am, 30 minutes before it opened its doors.

John Lewis, part of the John Lewis Partnership, which also includes Waitrose, is best-known for its ‘never knowingly undersold’ policy, which pledges to offer the best price on the high-street.

It sells everything from bed linen and mattresses to children’s clothes and cots to plates, saucepans and knives, and typically stocks around 350,000 different products in its department stores.

Last year, iPads, chocolate coins, vacuum cleaner bags, cereal bowls, Egyptian cotton bedding, Lego mini figures and mascara were among its top ten best-selling products.

The company’s performance is helped by its unusual structure, which means its partners - that is, its workforce - own the business.

2. Dunelm

3. IKEA

4. Brantano

5. Matalan

Each year, they are paid a bonus, which is a percentage of their basic salary. All partners receive the same percentage of their salary.

This year, for example, John Lewis Partnership’s 91,000 partners, including 29,000 who work for John Lewis, shared £202.5million.

Each got 15 per cent of their salary, equal to nearly eight weeks’ pay.

Such is the appeal of the John Lewis Partnership brand that a recent report found homes are more valuable if they have a branch of Waitrose nearby.

On average, the report, from the estate agency Savills, found the average home with a nearby Waitrose is 25.3 per cent more expensive than the average price in the whole of the county.

Verdict’s second prize was taken by Dunelm, which has 143 stores in the UK, mostly out of town, which sell everything that you need for your house. Last year, it came third.

It was set up in 1979 as a market 
stall in Leicester by a couple called Bill and Jean Adderley, and 
remains a family business. Their son Will was chief executive until 
three years ago.

Third prize in the competition, run by retail analysts Verdict,   was won by IKEA, the Swedish retailing giant

The third prize was won by Ikea, the Swedish retailing giant.

The fourth prize was won by Brantano, the footwear shop founded in 1998 and based mostly in out of town retail parks. It sells its own range but also brands such as Clarks and Hush Puppies.

Unlike most shoe shops, its shoes are arranged in pairs and can be immediately tried on, which takes the hassle and waiting out of shopping for shoes.
