Addictive: Text messages took the world by storm in 1998, but less than two decades later it is in decline as new forms of messaging have become more popular

A revolutionary form of communication is in decline - just 20 years after it changed the way that people interact with each other.

Used by four billion people around the world, the SMS (Short Message Service) took the world by storm after its birth in December 1992.

But after two decades of fervently bashing keypads with our thumbs, media watchdog Ofcom has reported a decline in the volume of texts sent.

The number of text messages sent in Britain peaked at 39.7billion at the end of last year, but is now down to 38.5billion, following two quarterly declines.

The fall has been attributed to new forms of communication which have taken over from the basic SMS system.

Owners of modern smartphones now have a plethora of ways of communicating with each other - including Tweeting and instant messaging.

The first ever text - sent in December 1992 - simply read 'Merry Christmas', after being sent by engineer Neil Papworth from his personal 
computer to Vodafone's Richard Jarvis.

This humble beginning kicked off a cultural and social revolution in the developed world, and texts have been used to seal business deals and even convey marriage proposals.

Advanced: Many mobile phones now use the internet and their owners have more choice in how to communicate with friends and contacts, including Twitter and instant messaging

The trend of texting exploded among children in 1998 with the introduction of the 'pay as you go' system by four major phone companies.

But it was only in 1999 that texting became a way of life when users could start sending text messages to people using different mobile networks to their own.

Texts soon completely transformed the way we write by introducing new abbreviations to the English language now known as 'text speak'.

Today is the 20th anniversary of the first ever text message.

It was sent by 22-year-old engineer 
Neil Papworth, pictured right, on December 3, 1992, whom was sitting at a computer 
terminal in Vodafone's Newbury HQ where his colleague were enjoying 
their Christmas party.

He had to type the text on a computer
 before sending it because mobile phones did not keyboards - these were 
not developed until 1997.

His text to the company's technical director Richard Jarvis' Orbitel 901 mobile phone simply read 'Merry Christmas'.

Originally intended as a pager for contacting people on the road, the first text message spawned a revolution in communication.

But it was not until 1999 that messages could be sent and received between different networks. 

Although a first, the concept of text messages  had been developed eight years earlier by the Franco-German GSM corporation. 

Since the Mr Papworth's pioneering text, SMS - or short message service - has taken over the world. 

It has been used to organise 
revolutions during the Arab Spring and to coordinate relief efforts and 
raise money for survivors of natural disasters such as the Boxing Day 
Tsunami and the Haiti earthquakes. 

With 150 billion text messages sent 
last year in the UK - almost triple the number sent in 2006 - texting 
became the most common form of communication.

It is called short message service 
because in English a text can only have 140 characters. In other 
alphabets, such as Chinese, texts can only have 70 characters.

The average 12 to 15-year-old send 193 texts a week and politicians have blamed the 
abbreviated language on the demise of literacy among the youth as 
punctuation, grammar and capitalisation are largely ignored in favour of
 brevity.

Text messages sent around the world now generates £73.5billion a year with the average Brit sending 50 texts a week.

It gave rise to a number of new challenges for modern society, including bullying, the dangers of texting while driving and 'sexting' - where sexually explicit photographs or messages are sent by mobile phone.

As well as giving bullies an easy way to torment their victims out of school, the trend of sexting among teens has also caused concern.

A 2008 survey by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy found one in five teen girls surveyed admitted to electronically sending nude or semi-nude images of themselves.

One-third of teen boys and one-quarter of teen girls say they were shown private nude or semi-nude images.

According to the survey, sexually suggestive messages sent by text, e-mail, and instant messaging were even more common than images.

Nearly 40 per cent of teens admitted to having sent or posted such messages, and half of teens have received them.

More recently, a 2012 study by the University of Utah Department of Psychology found nearly 20 percent of the students said they had sent a sexually explicit image of themselves on their mobile.

James Thickett, Ofcom's director of 
research, told The Independent: 'For the first time in the history of 
mobile phones, SMS volumes are showing signs of decline.

'The
 availability of a wider range of communications tools, like instant 
messaging and social networking sites, means people might be sending 
fewer SMS messages, but they are communicating electronically more than 
ever before.'

While texting
 might be on decline in favour of alternative - and often cheaper - 
forms of electronic communication, experts warn that it is our personal 
relationships that are really at risk.

Ironically, a new study has found 
that while electronic communication has made it easier than ever for 
people to stay in touch, it has actually started to erode out ability to communicate with others.

The communication revolution: The average Brit sends 50 texts a week while average teenagers send 193 texts a week

 Here are just a selection of the most common words that have infiltrated not just the way we write but also the way we speak:

LOL - Laugh out loud                      TBH - To be honest                                               B4N - Bye for nowOMG - Oh my God                           ROTFL - Rolling on the floor laughing         ASL - Age, sex, location BFF - Best friends forever            ASAP - As soon as possible                      CU - See you      LMAO - Laugh my a** off           FoMo - Fear of missing out                            AML - All my love    Thx - Thanks                             YoLo - You only live once                                  Srsly - seriously           Swak - Sealed with a kiss              WTH - What the hell                                  RU - Are you    Gr8 - Great                                          TTFN - Ta ta for now                                             M8 -Mate Atm - At the moment                        FYI - For your information                        B4 - Before POV - point of view                            AFC - away from keyboard                              L8r - Later     TTYL - talk to you later               BBL - Be back later                                  XOXO - Hugs and kisses

And it revealed that texting has become as addictive as compulsive spending for many.

Study author Dr James Roberts said: 'Mobile phones are a part of our consumer culture.

'They are not just a consumer tool, but are used as a status symbol. They're also eroding our personal relationships.'

Previous studies have revealed young adults send on average 109.5 texts a day, or approximately 3,200 messages a month.

They receive an additional 113 texts 
and check their phones 60 times in a typical day and students spend 
about seven hours a day interacting with information and communication 
technology.

Dr Roberts added: 'At first glance, 
one might have the tendency to dismiss such aberrant mobile phone use as
 merely youthful nonsense - a passing fad.

'But an emerging body of literature has given increasing credence to cell phone addiction and similar behavioural addictions.'
