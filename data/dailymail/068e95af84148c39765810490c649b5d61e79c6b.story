Nick Clegg is drawing up plans for a £7billion raid on middle class pensions to help head off cuts to public spending.

The Liberal Democrat leader has ordered a wide-ranging review that could result in the end of the 40p tax break on retirement savings enjoyed by higher rate taxpayers.

The move would be a massive blow to millions of middle income families trying to save for retirement.

However, the party says it will enable it to reduce the need for spending cuts after the next election – and Business Secretary Vince Cable yesterday accused the Tories of ‘lying’ for suggesting that Britain’s huge budget deficit can be paid off without the need for tax rises.

The new review goes much further than plans announced by the Lib Dems at the weekend to raise £1billion for the NHS by reducing the lifetime allowance for pension tax relief from £1.25million to £1million.

Under the existing system, higher rate taxpayers get 40p tax relief for every 60p they save towards their pension. By contrast, basic rate taxpayers get just 20p for every 80p they save.

Under the new proposals, tax relief could be ‘equalised’ for all taxpayers at 25 or 30p in the pound. Pensions minister Steve Webb, who is carrying out the review, said the current policy ‘cannot be right’.

He said only part of the savings would be siphoned off to help pay down the deficit, with the rest recycled into more generous tax reliefs for basic rate payers.

Mr Webb said: ‘Some people would take a hit, but on the whole they are people who will still end up with very decent pensions. There would be more gainers overall.

‘We could probably spend less on pension tax relief overall – helping to contribute to deficit reduction – but also rebalance the money so that everyone, rich or poor, got help at the same rate.’

Mr Clegg added the current system meant that the better off were ‘disproportionately’ rewarded, but said the party was not ‘committed’ to the proposal yet.

A recent report by the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank suggested that scrapping higher rate relief could save the taxpayer £7billion a year, although Mr Webb suggested the savings would be more modest. But former Treasury pensions adviser Ros Altmann warned it could have consequences for savers.

Mr Cable launched a stinging attack on the Tories for pledging to pay off the deficit through public spending and welfare cuts alone.

He called Tory plans for £25billion more cuts ‘deeply irresponsible’ and accused the party of ‘reinventing themselves as Ukip without the beer’.

Michael Howard was blocked from becoming Britain’s new EU Commissioner by Nick Clegg, senior Lib Dems claimed last night.

The former Tory leader is believed to have been vetoed because Mr Clegg said his MPs ‘couldn’t stomach’ certain figures.

Lib Dem MEP Chris Davies said he had been told by sources ‘very close to Nick’ that he had blocked at least one Tory nominee. He told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme that one of the Lib Dems’ greatest achievements in the Coalition had been stopping the Tories from ‘doing unpleasant things’.

Another Lib Dem source confirmed Lord Howard’s name, saying that Mr Clegg had left the Tories ‘under no illusions that his nomination wouldn’t be acceptable’.

Calling for billions of pounds more spending on Britain’s creaking infrastructure, he added: ‘The truth is more taxes will be needed. To contribute to deficit reduction and also to address unacceptable inequalities. Any politician who tells you that the next Government can balance the budget and avoid tax increases is lying to you.’

Mr Cable also drew a line over immigration, saying more migrants were needed to help fuel the economic recovery.

He said: ‘Our responsibility as Liberal Democrats is to tell the uncomfortable truth: that the vast majority of migrants coming to the UK from inside or outside the EU have brought tangible benefits to the economy.’
