Inter still retain hope of qualifying for Europe next year, but they continued to struggle after managing just a draw against lowly Cesena.

Roberto Mancini’s side didn't manage a shot on target in the first half and Cesena took the lead on the half hour when Gregoire Defrel sprinted onto Carlos Carbonero's ball over the top and lobbed it over Samir Handanovic.

To their credit, Inter came out a different side after the break.

They thought Mauro Icardi’s acrobatic overhead kick had levelled for the hosts immediately after the interval but it was wrongly ruled out for offside.

Inter did equalise moments later when Rodrigo Palacio slotted in Icardi's cross at the near post from close range.

Lukas Podolski almost scored his first goal for Inter since joining from Arsenal in January but saw his effort crash off the inside of the left upright.

The point leaves Inter level with Genoa in seventh, five points adrift of Fiorentina and Sampdoria in fifth and sixth.
