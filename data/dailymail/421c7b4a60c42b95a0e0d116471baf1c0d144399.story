The father of young Ryan Tunnicliffe became £10,000 richer when the 19-year-old Manchester United midfielder came on for his debut in the 76th minute of Wednesday night's Capital One Cup win over Newcastle.

Mick Tunnicliffe placed a £100 bet when his son was nine that he would one day play for United (at odds of 100-1), and his moment came when Marnick Vermijl was replaced during the 2-1 win.

And there could be worse to come for bookmakers William Hill, who revealed they also took another bet from Tunnicliffe's dad of £100 at odds of 350/1 that the young midfielder will one day play for England at some stage in his career.

The wager could net Tunnicliffe Snr a whopping £35,000 payout.

'The last time a bet of this nature cost us £10,000 was when Chris Kirkland made his debut in goal for England, also landing a £100 bet for his father,' said Hill’s spokesman Graham Sharpe.

'We will obviously be paying close attention to the progress of Ryan’s career in the future.'

Tunnicliffe, who spent last season under the tutelage of Sir Alex Ferguson's son, Darren, on loan at Peterborough United, was one of a number of youngsters blooded on Wednesday night.

Winger Robbie Brady and defenders Scott Wootton and Michael Keane were also given run-outs by Ferguson at Old Trafford as United cruised through to a tricky fourth round meeting with Chelsea.
