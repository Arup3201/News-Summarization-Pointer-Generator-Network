Queen Máxima rarely puts a fashion foot wrong and today's visit to an art gallery opening in Groningen was no exception.

Dressed in a wide-brimmed brown hat that matched her skirt suit, Máxima, 43, cut a stylish figure as she met with staff from the gallery.

She offset her dark suit and golden tan with a simple string of pearls, completing the look with a pair of matching earrings.

Queen Máxima, 43, visited opening of The Secret of Dresden- From Rembrandt to Canaletto in Groningen, the Netherlands. The art exhibition features paintings from old masters like Rembrandt 

The exhibition that Máxima was in town to see is called The Secret of Dresden – From Rembrandt to Canaletto  and it officially opens on December 13th.

The collections are considered to be one of the best-kept secrets in European art. 

They were assembled by the Prince-Electors of Saxony, including August the Strong and his son August III in the 1700s.

Among the collection is art by some of the most prominent Dutch masters, including Rembrandt and Vermeer.

Máxima's visit came as her mother-in-law, Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, travelled to Belgium for the funeral of the late Queen Fabiola.

Fabiola's death appeared to be weighing on the royal's mind and was, perhaps, the reason for her sombre choice of ensemble, which was strikingly different from the cheerful brights she usually favours.

Famous though she is for her style, Máxima is also loved for championing a huge range of charitable causes, with more added since  husband Willem-Alexander, 47, took the throne last year.

The collection, now at the Groninger Museum, are considered to be one of the best-kept secrets in European art

The Argentina-born mother-of-three has been a prominent champion of both the integration of immigrants and gay rights in the last few years.

She has also used her business background to help her forge a role as the UN Secretary General's Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development.

Although not known for her love of art, Máxima has attended several cultural events in recent months, perhaps influenced by friend Queen Letizia of Spain, who is a keen patron of the arts.
