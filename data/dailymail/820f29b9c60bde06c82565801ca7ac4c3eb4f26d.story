Not only will boxing fanatics be glued to their televisions on Saturday night when George Groves and Carl Froch step into the ring, but they will be joined by Hollywood A-listers too.

London born actress Emily Blunt has pledged her support to Groves ahead of the highly-anticipated super-middleweight rematch at Wembley.

The Devil Wears Prada actor said: 'George, I wish you well. A Hammersmith boy. I hope you just crush him.'

Groves will be hoping that too, given the blows that have already been dealt between the pair since their last fight.

Groves, 26, promises to finish his opponent in three rounds while Froch, 10 years his senior, thinks it is all a rouse to wind him up.

There has been controversy unfold since referee Charlie Fitch was chosen, much to Groves' disliking.

Groves feels a free-flowing fight would benefit Froch's style, and his protests were in vain.

Froch won the first bout with a ninth-round stoppage at Manchester Arena in November.
