Capsule hotels are the norm in busy cities which attract a large number of tourists. 

Previously considered tiny, cramped and uncomfortable, they are now becoming, smarter, slicker and sexier as more and more travellers seek unique experiences at wallet-friendly prices.

And now the brains behind sleep pod company Podtime are jumping on the trend, launching Podtels, their version of a compact hotel

Sleeping tubes are currently only used in the workplace but Podtime  has launched their hotel business, Podtels

‘We are trying to launch the hotel in Gatwick Airport,’ co-founder Paul Grindrod told MailOnline Travel.

 ‘We already have a hotel in Moscow and we’re hoping to launch more hotels all over the world.'

Capsule hotels were first developed in Japan and feature a number of very small rooms.

Designed to provide inexpensive overnight accommodation, they are usually located near train stations and provide overnight accommodation for business people or commuters who have missed their last train home.

Podtime’s sleeping tubes have currently only been used in the workplace with companies like Facebook and Nestle investing in the nap cylinder.

There is also a hostel in North America which features the company’s new double bunk pods.

Small but perfectly formed: The pods will be able to be stacked into two levels, which will form a hotel complex

The pods will have space for luggage and there will be optional extras like TVs, lighting and power sockets

The pods are the brainchild of Jon Gray, who created them as a recharge hub for busy city executives.The business was launched in 2011.

Podtels will see the sleep pods – which are based on the current pods but able to take a double bed - being stacked into two levels, which will form a hotel complex.

Podtel rooms, which measure 1.5m, will also have space for luggage and there will be optional extras like TVs, lighting and power sockets.

‘We would love to have one in London but as yet there aren’t enough funds as we are a small company,’ Mr Grindrod said.
