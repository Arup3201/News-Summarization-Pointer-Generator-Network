Sir Mortimer Wheeler saved Roman ruins in Libya during the Second World War by driving across the country in a Jeep and stationing men around them

A British archeologist and TV personality has emerged as the saviour of Roman ruins during the Second World War after protecting them from Allied soldiers.

However, new research into his archives has also revealed he was a bully, a 'sex pest' and a 'groper' in his private life, and was unfaithful to his wife.

Sir Mortimer Wheeler, the father of modern archeology and veteran of both world wars, joined Field Marshal Montgomery's victorious campaign again Rommel in North Africa in 1942, fighting in the decisive battle of El Alamein.

After the Allied victory, however, the brigadier was horrified to see Australian troops vandalising Roman ruins by tipping over stone columns, so he went on a one-man mission to save them.

Taking a 48-hour leave of absence, he drove in a Jeep across Libya stationing military police around sites such as Sabratha and Leptis Magna, according to Gabriel Moshenska, lecturer in archaeology at University College London.

His actions undoubtedly saved the historical sites from further harm, making Sir Mortimer a precursor to the Monuments Men, made famous by the George Clooney film, who were tasked with saving art from the Nazis towards the end of the war.

As Allied forced prepared to invade Sicily in July 1943, Sir Mortimer even wrote a leaflet given out to troops which explained the importance of leaving the Roman ruins unharmed.

According to The Times, he wrote: 'Remember the meaning which the Vandals, a Germanic tribe, gave to their name by their actions in this regard. History has a long memory.'

Leptis Magna (pictured) was one of the sites Sir Mortimer stationed troops at. He sprung into action after watching Australian troops vandalising ruins after the Allied victory at El Alamein

Leptis Magna has been a settlement since roughly 100BC, but only fell under Roman control in 146BC

Sir Mortimer's actions make him a precursor to the Monuments Men, a team of art experts put together at the end of the war to save art from the Nazis, and made famous by the George Clooney film (pictured)

Sir Mortimer also fought in the First World War, and towards the end of the conflict lead his men and 12 horses into no-man's land to capture two German guns near the Somme.

After that conflict ended he travelled back to England where he took up a position at the National Museum of Wales, then at the London Museum, before founding the Archaeological Institute in London in 1934 with his wife, Tessa.

However, Sir Mortimer struggled to live up to his military achievements in his private life, which is riddled with scandal.

When money was tight Sir Mortimer resorted to selling 'slightly forged' ancient slingshots taken from Chesil Beach to raise much-needed cash, along with several other 'scams', according to archives of his work.

Before the Allies invaded Sicily, Sir Mortimer drew up a leaflet that was given to every man warning against damaging the ruins there (pictured, a mosaic near Piazza Armenia, Sicily)

Sir Mortimer also fought in the First World War, but struggled to live up to his exploits in civilian life where he was unfaithful to his wife, and became known as a bully and a 'sex pest'

He later became a TV personality and in the 50s and 60s appeared on shows such as Animal, Vegetalbe, Mineral?, though he was accused of preparing in advance.

His wife was also tormented by his infidelity, with Sir Mortimer even being described as a 'sex pest'.

'He was, by all accounts, a bit of a groper and a sex pest and an incredible bully as well â€” and yet many of his members of staff were incredibly devoted to him,' Dr Moshenska said.

Sir Mortimer Wheeler will feature in Voices of War: UCL in World War I, an exhibition opening next month at the college's Institute of Archaeology, Bloomsbury, central London.
