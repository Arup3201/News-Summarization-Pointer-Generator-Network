A Chinese takeaway which had mouse droppings on the floor and no toilet seat has been shut after an inspector said it was the worst he’d seen.

Tiger King in Portsmouth, Hampshire, was so filthy it was branded a risk to public health and immediately closed.

The horrified inspector, who went to the takeaway after a tip-off from a disgruntled customer, found a chicken defrosting in a bucket on the kitchen floor, food stores on low dirty shelves and mouse droppings coating the floor.

Revolting: A hygiene inspector found this chicken defrosting in a bucket of water left on a dirty floor

Dirty: Staff, who had nowhere to wash their hands, had to use this toilet with no seat

Closed down: The Tiger King in Portsmouth was shut down immediately by the inspector

Staff were forced to use a toilet with no seat and were left with nowhere to wash their hands.

Owner Daniel Fan has now been banned from running a food business for six months.

Richard Lee, Portsmouth City Council’s environmental health manager, said it was one of the worst hygiene breaches he had seen in 20 years.

He said: 'The problems we found at Tiger King were some of the worst we’ve ever encountered.

'The deterioration in the standards was considerable over a short period of time.

'The operator was putting the health of 
his customers at considerable risk and, consequently, I’m pleased with 
the decision of the court.'

Grimy: The floor of the kitchen was filthy, and the inspector also noted that mouse droppings could be seen

Grim: The King Prawn was given the lowest possible hygiene rating - one out of five

After an inspection last week, the takeaway was given a one out of five hygiene rating.

Fan was fined £5,000 and had to pay £1,253 pounds in costs at Portsmouth Magistrates’ Court after pleading guilty to five offences relating to food hygiene.

Magistrate Avril Hardie said: 'There were a number of offences and the number of, nature and extent of the offences makes us feel like the hygiene prohibition order is justified along with the fines.'

A city council spokesman said: 'The premises will continue to be monitored and any further legal contraventions noted with will be dealt with in accordance with our enforcement policy.'
