On Wednesday I'm heading to Anfield to watch Liverpool versus Sunderland after an invite from Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers.

I got the invite out of the blue when I wasn't working.

It includes watching training and stay over.

Class act: Brendan Rodgers has shown humility by thinking of others during a busy time for Liverpool

Nice gesture: Brendan Rodgers and Alex Ferguson (R) share humility and generosity as traits of a champion

At the time I guess it was to keep me busy whilst I was, as they say, 'between jobs.'

I think it shows great humility thinking of others like that, especially with his team flying high, with all the media demands and people no doubt requesting interviews and appearances left, right and centre.

That sort of gesture reminds me of a few years ago at Brentford when I did a bike ride to raise money to help pay the players' wages.

I personally wrote to all the Premier League managers asking them to sponsor the 30-mile journey from my house to the ground in west London.

A week after I had sent the letter I got a hand-written card in the post with a cheque inside for £500 from 'Alex and Cathy' wishing me the best of luck.

The name on the bottom of the cheque was Alex Ferguson.

He went on to win the league with Manchester United that season.

There is no question that Arsenal's players are technically gifted and supremely talented.

But when they come up against the big boys who have power, strength and pace, they are so often beaten.

Chelsea's performance to win 6-0 was an outstanding effort.

Frontrunners: Chelsea moved seven points clear of Chelsea at the top of the Premier League table

After a commanding performance in the Champions League in mid-week against Galatasaray the win over Arsenal makes it loud and clear that Chelsea believe the title will be theirs.

For Arsene Wenger his magnificent 1,000th game turned into a living nightmare – especially to see his team capitulate in that manner.

His Invincible side of a decade ago not only played great football but they had warriors who performed with steel and gritty determination in every position on the pitch.

When it comes to technique, Arsenal are better than the rest, but when it comes to the crunch, they cannot beat the best.

What a shock. What a surprise.

It has been revealed that back-handers were allegedly paid out to make sure the World Cup would take place in Qatar in 2022.

Vast sums of money have seemingly changed hands.

It's a breeze: Air-conditioned stadiums have been suggested to combat the 120 degree heat

No wonder. It must be the maddest decision in the history of football to stage a World Cup there.

To have football matches played in 120 degree heat, in the middle of June, to discuss playing in air-conditioned stadiums or moving it to the winter in a country when there is hardly anyone there in the first place.

A massive stewards enquiry is needed to sort this mess out.

There is surely no-way the competition can possibly go ahead there now.

FIFA must do something about it before we have what will be the worst World Cup there has ever been.

Take action! FIFA must act to change the venue before this becomes the worst World Cup in history

I'm delighted for my old team-mate Chris Hughton, whose job in charge at Norwich is continually called into question – even by his own chief executive David McNally.

There is no getting away from the fact his forward signings have not quite worked out this season.

But Chris continues to carry himself with dignity and calm. He is controlled and measured whenever he is on TV or in front of reporters.

It's no surprise, when a manager acts in that manner, that his players are now finding wins that will see them escape relegation and finish comfortably in mid-table.

What a huge result against relegation rivals Sunderland where his side dominated against a team who should have been fighting for their lives.

Then they had the composure to see the game out in the second half.

Come rain or shine he always gives a confident interview and the man has got class.

You could not wish to meet a nicer guy.

I'm sure the Canaries will be singing cheerily come the end of the season.

Late on Tuesday night I watched the last episode of Breaking Bad.

I've never watched anything like that online before, but being out of work and having plenty of time on my hands gave me a chance to watch the entire five series.

When it finally finished late that night I took a deep breath and thought: 'That's a shame I really enjoyed that.'

Box set: Having time on his hands has given Martin Allen a chance to watch all five series of Breaking Bad

I started wondering what I was going to do afterwards.

Not again! Martin Allen's dog Monty is getting tired of constant walks

I woke up on Wednesday morning wondering how to pass the time that day, which had so often been filled with episodes of Breaking Bad during recent weeks and taking poor Monty, my dog, for a walk.

Most dogs will jump up and down with excitement when they hear they're going for a walk, but now he flashes me a look as if to say: 'Please not again.'

But then, out of the blue, I got a call at 3pm that afternoon and was offered a contract at Barnet until the end of the season.

It all happened in a flash.

I went in to the training ground the next morning to chat with the players, took training on Friday and had a game on Saturday. It was that quick.

It's like with any walk of life, you want to work.

When you get sacked it's a horrible feeling and you get very isolated and lonely.

You have to move house and leave a large part of your life behind.

The amount I've moved about it feels like I've been living in a caravan for the past five years.

Barnet had just lost four games in a 
row but the players did very well in windy and difficult conditions and 
we beat Hereford two-nil.

All you have to do is give the players some clarification in what they're doing and some self-belief.

It was easy.

Promotion might be a stretch this season, but we've got a very exciting chance to get into the play-offs and achieve some dreams.
