Parents have vented their fury after another winter wonderland festive fun fair has been cancelled just two days before it was due to open.

Despite announcing the event more than a month ago, the Ruislip Winter Wonderland in north London, was cancelled yesterday with organisers citing a disagreement with landowners.

Today the site earmarked for the funfair at India Gardens in Northolt appeared barren and undeveloped.

The announcement has left hundreds of families and children disappointed, despite organisers saying on their Facebook page, which had more than 3,500 likes, that the event was still due to go ahead as late as yesterday morning.

Former I’m a Celebrity star and singer David Van Day and wife Sue Moxley were earmarked for the 'star-studded' opening performance.

Other celebrities set to have attended the opening included Dancing On Ice star Matt Lapinskas, ex-Coronation Street actor Adam Rickitt, boxer Joe Calzaghe, former Blue star Lee Ryan and Another Level singer Dane Bowers. 

The message from organisers on their Facebook page read: 'We are sorry to inform that the event has been cancelled.

'After a day of discusions between the event organisers and the land owners unfortunatlly the event has had to be cancelled. 

'We are extreamly upset about this decision and did not take the decision light heartedly.

'We are terribly sorry to all the people who where helping us and who where having stalls/rides at the event and to all the famillies who where supporting us and going to be coming along we are extreamly sorry.

The organisers posted this message on their Facebook page informing people that the event had been cancelled, which prompted an angry response from some parents 

'Thank you all for your support and we hope to be able to do a different event at sometime in the future.

'Thanks again for your support and once again we are truely sorry but it is out of our control.' (sic)

But many parents have been left feeling the entire event was a ‘scam’ because of its late cancellation, and the failure to begin any construction on the north west London field.

Claire Collier wrote: 'I think something dodgy has been going in here!'

While mother Wendy Walsh added: 'It was blatantly fake. Why else would it be cancelled two days before?

The festive funfair was due to have its opening in Wednesday but it was cancelled just two days before it was due to begin 

Today, the site in Northolt remained barren and undeveloped despite it due to be featuring fairground rides, a stalls and a Santa's grotto 

'Luckily I didn’t tell my child about this.'

And one poster, Cathy Barnes says she is now planning her own event to help disappointed locals.

She said: 'Sorry but if their spelling is anything to go by no wonder it wasn’t taken seriously!

'Sad state of affairs to build up people’s hopes. Name and shame the land owners and event organisers!

'Ruislip Christmas Market sounds a better idea with old fairground rides.

“If anyone wants help organising it let me know.'

The attraction was supposed to run until December 27 at the a site on the Ruislip border with Northolt, and was to feature fairground rides, a Santa’s grotto and food stalls.

The cancellation of the event comes after another winter wonderland created by TV interior designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen was forced to close after just one day due to complaints.

The Magical Journey in Warwickshire created by Laurence Llewellyn Bowen closed after just one day following complaints by parents about long queues, rude staff and cheap toys at the attraction

The fair eventually re-opened three days later but parents were left equally unimpressed with the decorations on the site  

Parents said the Magical Journey at the Belfry Golf Club in Wishaw, Warwickshire, has ruined the build up to Christmas for their children, as they attacked the 'tacky' attraction which costs up to £22.50 for a ticket.

But many complained about rude staff, large queues for their children to visit Father Christmas and said cheap unwrapped presents, some squashed or broken, were being handed out to their children.

Others bemoaned of a lack of festive decorations and Christmas music, despite paying more than £20 a ticket for their children.

However, the attraction reopened to the public three days later after improvements including more fake snow.

But parents were left equally unimpressed at the second grand opening due to over-loaded sockets being visible in the main entrance and a pile of tatty-looking presents being layed clumsily dumped in the corner of a marquee with a red Santa's outfit left on top.
