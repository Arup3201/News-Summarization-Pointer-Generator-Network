It is the game which, ultimately, could define the success or otherwise of Martin O’Neill and Roy Keane’s expensive Republic of Ireland tenure.

Installed amid much fanfare 18 months ago, £1million-per-year O’Neill and his assistant Keane – with a £600,000 salary - were given a remit of qualification for Euro 2016, a task made easier by the expansion to a 24-team format.

Defeat against Poland at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday, however, would all but render redundant any hope of automatic progression to next summer’s finals in France. It would be they and Scotland left to do battle for the play-off berth.

The mood here in Dublin is not one of optimism. An inquest, you feel, awaits O’Neill and his regime should they fail to beat the group leaders.

One newspaper described their manager as ‘bookish and vaguely befuddled’, while the ‘carnage’ which follows Keane was also noted.

Certainly, there has been a definite effort to play down the chaos around Keane this week and the No 2 gave an untypically subdued and low-key performance in front of the press.

O’Neill, meanwhile, has kept all talk to football. He has ignored the opinion pieces which have called into question his impact since his arrival.

He has, though, recognised the magnitude of the outcome against the Poles.

‘The importance of the occasion should not be missed,’ he said.

‘Defeat would be a big dent in our hopes of automatic qualification. It might not decide everything, but it is very significant. We have to try to win.

‘I’ve said all along that the home games will shape our destiny. This is the first of that group. We have to make them count.’

O’Neill, whose fourth-placed side trail Poland by three points, added: ‘We can change all of that (negative talk) with one result and one fantastic performance.

‘We will not get very far with a pessimistic approach and I’m not overly concerned with what people say before the game.

‘We have given ourselves a chance (of qualification) but we will have to be right on top of our game to win this match.’

One criticism of O’Neill is that he does not know his preferred XI or, indeed, formation.

That much was obvious by him talking this week of players winning a starting place should they impress at their coastal training base in Malahide.

O'Neill is hoping to banish all the negativity around the squad with a result against Poland

One player not guaranteed to start is captain Robbie Keane. He was dropped for the morale-shattering 1-0 defeat in Scotland in November.

The LA Galaxy striker, 34, was sat next to O’Neill at Saturday's pre-match press conference and was diplomatic when pressed on his possible exclusion.

‘That’s up to the manager (if I play),’ he said. ‘I’ll be ready whether that’s from the bench or starting. I’m the captain, I have to set an example.

‘But I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think I could make a difference. I still want to be the best. I have that hunger.’

Keane, sensing the air of negativity in his homeland, added: ‘It’s up to us to make this a turning point for the team. Victory would give this squad and country a huge confidence boost.’

Lose and it could prove an awfully long three months for O’Neill before they face Scotland back in Dublin.

Win, and that £1m salary would look like a shrewd investment.
