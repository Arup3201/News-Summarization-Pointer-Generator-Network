Misconduct: Dr Steven Forde, 45, was cleared of criminal charges but sanctioned by a medical panel

A doctor who secretly filmed a miniskirt-wearing woman as a ‘reward’ after a hard day’s work has been found guilty of misconduct.

Dr Steven Forde, 45, used a camera hidden in an adapted satchel to take five minutes of covert footage as the woman walked through York city centre in May last year.

He was acquitted of criminal charges after prosecutors offered no evidence - but today a Fitness to Practise panel ruled his actions amounted to misconduct after hearing they were 'sexually motivated'.

The father-of-three, a former RAF medic who served in Bosnia and Kosovo in the late 1990s, confessed to a ten-year ‘compulsion’ that led him to film women as a ‘reward’ in times of stress.

During the police investigation Forde admitted he had filmed women before and said he had other images at home, the panel in Manchester heard.

But the married doctor, from Haxby, near York, was acquitted of outraging public decency after the CPS offered no evidence against him.

Police found other clandestine video recordings on his home computer, but no charges were brought, the panel heard.

During a trust investigation Forde admitted that this type of behaviour happened the ‘majority of the time once or twice a week’ and ‘more in the summer months.’

He was handed a formal warning and returned to work in March this year, though he is not allowed to examine female patients without a chaperone ‘except in life-threatening situations’.

He was also prohibited from attending formal meetings with female trainee doctors unaccompanied in his role as Training Programme Director with York Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

But Forde could now be suspended or struck off completely after the panel's ruling today.

The consultant anaesthetist, a keen photographer, said he took his camera equipment to the woods to take ‘spring photos’ after finishing his on-call shift at 8am on 9 May last year.

He then went into York city centre carrying a satchel-type bag over his shoulder, which he had modified to hold a camera with its lens poking out of the front of the bag.

The lens was concealed by a filter and he could switch the camera’s video function on and off on a digital viewfinder in the side pouch of the bag.

Forde told the panel he had made the bag around three or four years ago, but admitted he had used a similar one before.

He was arrested after a security guard spotted him acting suspiciously near a young lady who was wearing a short skirt.

Magistrates acquitted the consultant of outraging public decency in October 2013 when the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence.

'Reward': The consultant anaesthetist had finished a 'stressful' period of work at York District Hospital

But he admitted his actions were ‘sexually motivated’ at this week's Fitness to Practise hearing. 

He said he is undergoing treatment for the ‘underlying issues’ that cause his behaviour and insists he has not indulged in the unusual hobby since his arrest. 

Earlier this week he claimed the incident followed three 'stressful events' in his professional life, including a a formal complaint made against him by a patient who said he was 'rude and aggressive'. 

He said he had to give evidence at the GMC after a medical student he was in charge of continued onto third year even though he hadn't been signed off.

In a third incident, he said he had to help transfer a three-week-old baby to Leeds hospital but the baby died.

He said: 'I felt like my whole world had collapsed and this was the end and that's it.

Ruling: Forde, who still works at York Hospital, is expected to have his professional fate decided tomorrow

'I found the experience one of the most stressful things I've ever done. Those legal practises - most of us are not used to this sort of environment. It doesn't justify what I did, but in my mind the stresses inhibited me from dealing with the behaviour that was causing this.'

Eileen Carr, chairman of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service panel, told him today: ‘The panel has found your fitness to practise is impaired by reason of your misconduct.'

However, she added: 'The determination has got many aspects that will relate to the doctor’s health, so that determination will not be made available to the public.’

Matters relating to the doctor’s health condition, which was not elaborated upon, have been heard behind closed doors. 

A redacted version of the panel’s findings is expected after his fate is decided tomorrow.
