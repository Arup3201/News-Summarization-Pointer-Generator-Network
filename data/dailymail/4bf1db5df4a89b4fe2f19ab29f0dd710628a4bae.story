It was a question that plagued spooks for three decades - was Nick Clegg's great aunt a Soviet agent?

Countess Moura Budberg's life reads like it was right off the pages of an espionage thriller, with walk-on parts from Josef Stalin, HG Wells and notorious Cambridge spy ring traitors Guy Burgess and Donald McLean.

But it was the Russian emigre's relationship with famous agent Robert Bruce Lockhart that first aroused the suspicions of British intelligence.

Intelligence officials speculated for three decades about whether Nick Clegg's great aunt, Countess Moura Budberg, pictured above, was a soviet spy

It had been well known that Lockhart had fallen for a woman named Moura when he was in Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution - and that woman turned out to be Countess Budberg. 

The pair had met in 1918, when Lockhart was head of the British Legation in Russia, and Countess Budgerg was married to another man. Their romance was later dramatised in the 1934 film Secret Agent.

The Countess was later cleared of being a spy and left Estonia. While living between Germany and Italy she applied to enter Britain to be with her niece, Baroness Kira von Engelhardt, The Independent reported. 

British authorities were not concerned about Baroness Engelhardt, but in the 1950s one spy sent a memo to another, expressing doubts about 'Kera (sic) Clegg', who appeared to be closely linked to Countess Budberg. 

Countess Engelhardt had changed her surname after marrying, Hugh Clegg. The couple were the grandparents of Nick Clegg, who has previously described his great aunt as an 'utterly terrifying' woman.

The newspaper searched the National Archives and reports that Countess Budberg's name appeared in hundreds of documents, gathered by British intelligence officers over a 30 year period. 

Whether the Countess was in fact a Soviet spy was a question the MI5 never answered. Despite having contacts across Europe, including inside Stalin's regime, they suspected she was probably the target of hostile gossip. The French, however, concluded she was a spy.

The British secret service's various informants were inconsistent in their observations about Countess Budberg. Her looks, intelligence and morality were debated. She was called an 'absolute devil', but it was also suggested that she could simply be the victim of spitefulness. Despite having had several male lovers, at least one source thought she was a lesbian.

Lockhart and Countess Budberg were arrested in the panic that followed an attempt on Lenin's life in 1918. Lockhart was soon released. The Countess is thought to have later secured her freedom by seducing her investigating officer.

She then returned to Russia where she began working for writer Maxim Gorky, before becoming his lover. 

A year later, in 1921, Gorky secured permission for her to move to Estonia, after she had spent the night with HG Wells, who was staying with them. 

When she moved, documents noted that she the Countess had married another man, who she lived with for a year before they divorced. It was thought it was a marriage of convenience to secure the Countess Estonian citizenship.

The Countess later reunited with Gorky and they lived together in Berlin for several years before the author returned to Russia. 

The newspaper speculated that her move to Britain was perhaps motivated more by her fear of being without a lover, than to be with her niece.

The Countess soon became well connected in the UK and British authorities continued to keep her under surveillance. But because high profile people like wartime solicitor General Lord Iowitt and the Minister of Information, Lord Duff Cooper, vouched for her good character, the Countess simply remained a mystery. She had worked for Lord Cooper during the war.

Countess Budgerg remained in contact with Gorky whose house remained under surveillance by Stalin's police.  She travelled in and out of Russia on four occasions, the last of which was in 1936 when Gorky lay dying. She never required a visa and it is thought that is because Russian police may have wanted something from her.

The trips ignited the suspicions of Maurice Dayet, secretary of the French embassy, who went on to warn his British counterparts about her. 

It was also thought the Countess was being paid by the Germans, but this was later dismissed.

In April 1942, Winston Churchill's personal aide, Sir Desmond Morton, wrote to the secret service about the Countess warning that she was a 'perfect terror at intrigue'. The service acknowledged they knew a great deal about her, but said they considered her to be anti-nazi.  

Countess Budberg became a British citizen in 1947. Her first vote was for Labour.

She came under suspicion again in 1951 when the MI5 were told that HG Well's family had known for years that she was a spy. 

And when the British intelligence service was hit by one of the biggest spy scandals in history, in May 1951, her name came up again. Two agents, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, disappeared after the FBI learned that MacLean was a spy. Burgess had dined with the Countess on a number of occasions.

But the British secret service never decided what to make of Countess Bugberg who died in November 1974. It concluded that it was 'a virtual impossibility' to draw any conclusions based on the conflicting reports about her.
