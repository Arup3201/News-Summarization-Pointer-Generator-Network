A New Jersey teenager left permanently brain-damaged after being struck by a baseball off a metal bat will receive $14.5million in a lawsuit settlement announced on Wednesday with Little League Baseball, a sporting goods chain and a bat manufacturer.

Steven Domalewski was 12 years old when he was struck in the chest by a drive line while pitching in a youth game in 2006. The hit caused his heart to stop for more than 15 minutes, resulting in a severe damage to his brain.

Domalewski, now 18 years old, lives in Wayne, New Jersey. His family had claimed the metal bat used in the game was unsafe because baseballs could carom off it at much faster speeds than wooden bats.

Closure: Steven Domalewski, center, and his parents, reached a $14.5million settlement with a bat manufacturer, Little League Baseball and a sporting goods chain over his 2006 injury

‘The Domalewskis are still saddened by the tragic events of June 2006, but this settlement provides them with some relief and comfort that Steven will get the care he needs for the rest of his life,’" said the family's attorney, Ernest Fronzuto. ‘He still can't perform any functions of daily life on his own.’

Stephen D. Keener, president and CEO of Little League Baseball Inc., said the settlement guarantees that ‘Steven Domalewski will receive the lifetime care he will require as a result of this tragic accident, a type of accident that is extremely rare in youth baseball.’

Game gone wrong: Steven was 12 years old when he got hit in the chest by a line drive while pitching in a youth baseball game in 2006

Fronzuto said the settlement precluded him from discussing its details, including whether any of the defendants admitted liability.

On June 6, 2006, Domalewski was pitching when the batter rocketed a line drive off the metal bat he was swinging.

The ball slammed into Steven's chest, just above his heart, knocking him backward. He clutched his chest, then made a motion to reach for the ball on the ground to pick it up and throw to first base to get the runner out.

But he never made it that far. The ball had struck his chest at the precise millisecond between heartbeats, sending him into cardiac arrest, according to his doctors. He crumpled to the ground and stopped breathing.

His father, Joseph, a teacher who had been on the sideline with the rest of the team, said he and a third base coach from the other team both ran onto the field, where Steven was already turning blue.

Someone yelled, ‘Call 911!’ Within 90 seconds, a man trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation who had been playing catch with his nine-year-old daughter jumped over the fence and started to work on Steven.

Paramedics got to Steven within minutes, placed an oxygen mask over his face and rushed him to a hospital. But the damage had been done; his brain had been without oxygen for 15 to 20 minutes.

Bad timing: The ball struck Steven, right, in the chest in the millisecond between heartbeats, sending him into cardiac arrest and depriving his brain of oxygen for 15-20 minutes

Life derailed: The 18-year-old boy has a very limited vocabulary and has to attend a school for special needs children in Clifton

‘Pretty much, he died,’ Joseph Domalewski said in a 2008 interview with The Associated Press. ‘It was just so fast. The thud, you could hear. When it hit him, that seemed to echo.’

Domalewski was playing in a Police Athletic League game, but Little League was sued because the group certifies what specific metal bats are approved for — and safe for — use in games involving children.

Mr Domalewski told NorthJersey.com that the tragic accident has left his son nearly blind in one eye and with a very limited vocabulary. The teen also cannot get around without assistance and regularly sees a chiropractor and physical therapist. 

Steven Dombalewski’s case has made headlines nationwide and attracted attention to the controversial use of lightweight aluminum baseball bats in games involving children.

Daily struggles: The injury has left Steven, left, nearly blind in one eye and unable to walk without assistance

Since 2006, several towns in northern New Jersey banned the use of non-wooden baseball bats, and the New York City Council followed suit, putting in place a similar restriction on high school games.

Little League reached an agreement with the major manufacturers in the early 1990s to limit metal bats' performance to that of the best wooden bats. Little League said in 2008 that injuries to its pitchers fell from 145 a year before the accord was reached to the current level of about 20 to 30 annually.

Rick Redman, a spokesman for Hillerich and Bradsby, manufacturers of the Louisville Slugger brand bat used in the fateful June 2006 game, confirmed a settlement had been reached, but declined further comment.

The Domalewski family have claimed that the Little Slugger brand aluminum bat used on the day Steven got injured is much lighter that stronger than wood bats

The Domalewski family have claimed that the aluminum bat used when Steven got injured is much lighter that stronger than standard wooden bats, or even metal bats made some 30 years ago.

‘We hope that this settlement will bring about some changes,’ the family's attorney said.
