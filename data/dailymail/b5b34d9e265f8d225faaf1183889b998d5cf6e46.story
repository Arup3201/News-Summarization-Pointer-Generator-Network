International high rollers visiting some of Australia's elite casinos will be flying in style.

They will be escorted to and from James Packer's Melbourne and Perth Crown resorts in swish new private jets worth $US100 million.

The casino giant upgraded its existing fleet of Gulfstream aircraft to three Bombardier Global Express XRS jets for its Asian VIP customers.

'This acquisition will ­enable Crown to expand the range of its private jet service to Asian VIP customers and provide a superior level of comfort and amenity,' Crown told the Daily Telegraph.

On board, passengers will be treated to a luxurious food and drink menu from Crown restaurants.

The Bombardiers feature 15 seats, nine sleeping berths and are made up of Rolls-Royce engines which allows it to fly 6000 nautical miles without the need for refuelling.

The costly upgrade comes after Mr Packer's company was cleared to run its new Sydney casino in just three months by the NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority.

Its chief executive, Micheil Brodie, believes this was 'one of the fastest assessments of a casino applicant in history'.

Mr Brodie, who oversaw the probity check, said the process was fast-tracked because the NSW government advised the gaming authority to take into account the findings of an earlier probity check into Mr Packer's company.

Last month Crown Resorts was granted a licence to operate a VIP-only restricted gaming facility, without poker machines, at Barangaroo - Sydney's inner city - from November 15, 2019 after the NSW government backed its proposal.

Crown Resorts, one of Australia's largest gaming and entertainment groups, also owns casinos in Macau and London.

The company could be expanding to a vacant Las Vegas Strip site of the former New Frontier casino, thanks to a partnership with former Wynn Las Vegas President Andrew Pascal.
