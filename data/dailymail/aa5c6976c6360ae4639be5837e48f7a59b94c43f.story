A bank worker stole £17,000 from Barclays – after her sister carried out an almost identical scam at the same lender.

Catherine Finney, 25, took money by moving cash between accounts more than 100 times so she could impress her new boyfriend with expensive nights out.

The cashier admitted stealing almost every day for two years from 2011 and was jailed for 18 months on Monday.

Defending Finney, Paul Stanley said she was in debt and wanted to be able to go out with her new partner

Scam: Finney took almost £17,000 from Barclays to pay for romantic nights out with her boyfriend

It is believed she got the idea from 
her older sister Julia, 29, who stole £127,000 over three years from 
Barclays in 2010. The pair, who used to live together, worked in 
separate branches in the West Midlands.

It is not known if they collaborated, but the timings of their scams overlap and their methods were similar.

Julia,
 who was jailed for two years in August, stole to fund a gambling 
addiction. Catherine, from Droitwich, Worcestershire, was in debt and 
took a total of £16,980 to impress her new partner at fancy restaurants,
 Worcester Crown Court heard this week.

Judge
 Michael Cullum said she had breached trust at the bank to ‘advance’ her
 lifestyle. Barclays last night said it had a zero tolerance policy 
towards staff fraud.

He added: 'You took the money for your own living standards, which may not have been as lavish as some, but it was certainly beyond that which you would have legitimately been able to afford.

Finney was seeing a new partner and wanted to impress him by taking him out for meals in fancy restaurants

'It was simply to advance your lifestyle.

'On almost a daily basis, you would take small amounts of money over a two-year period from the till at which you were the sole worker.

'You made, in total, 108 inter-till transfers which enabled the period over which you stole money to be as long as it was.

'Anyone working in the banking industry is, by definition, in a high position of trust.

Finney used the accounts of two elderly customers in order to cover her theft

'The calculated nature of deceptions, the efforts you made in masking it, and the number of occasions you took money are all aggravating factors.

'You took the money for your own living standards, which may not have been as lavish as some, but it was certainly beyond that which you would have legitimately been able to afford.

'It was simply to advance your lifestyle.'

The court heard the two elderly customers made no loss during the scam and Finney passed off queries over mystery transactions on their statements as banking errors.

He added that she was 'very remorseful' about what had happened and had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.

A Proceeds of Crime Act hearing will be held on April 1 to determine if Finney will have to pay back any of the money.
