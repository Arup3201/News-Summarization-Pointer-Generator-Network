A man has described the horrifying moment a 'crazed' woman attacked him with her stiletto shoe, breaking his cheek in four places.

Dean Roche needed four metal plates screwed into his face after the violent assault, launched on him as he waited in a taxi queue at the end of a night out with friends in Poole, Dorset.

The 21-year-old said the woman also lashed out at other men in a taxi queue and appeared to be on a 'rampage'.

Mr Roche said he was looking the other way when the woman came at him with her high-heel shoe.

The woman is described as white with dark hair, wearing a leopard print top.

His right cheek bone was broken in four places by the impact of the heel against his face, leaving him with severe bruising around his right eye.

He underwent a three-hour operation to reconstruct his cheek.

Mr Roche, a security guard at Asda in Poole, has now been signed off work for six weeks to allow his wounds to heal.

A 28-year-old woman from Bournemouth has been arrested in connection with the assault and released on bail.

Mr Roche, from Poole, said: 'I had been out for the night and was waiting for a taxi when a woman came out of nowhere and hit me on the side of my head with a stiletto.

'It was totally unprovoked. I didn't even see her coming, she came at me from the side.

'I have no idea who the woman was, I've never seen her before. She was on a rampage, hitting other people with her stiletto.

'I was in agony - I've never felt pain like it. My mate grabbed hold of me and turned me away because he thought I had been hit in the eye.

'I went home and the next morning I went to hospital. Straight away they told me that my cheek had collapsed.

'They took an X-ray and found my cheekbone was shattered in four places. I had to have four metal plates put in my cheek during a three-and-a-half hour operation.

'I've now been signed off work for six weeks.'

Detectives are now appealing for witnesses to the attack, which took place in the early hours of April 26, to come forward.

Detective Constable Jonathan Sainsbury, of Dorset Police, said: 'There were a number of people around at the time who may have witnessed the incident.

'I urge them to come forward as soon as possible.'
