Mail Today's expos√© that the missing coal ministry files pertain to companies linked to Congress politicians created a storm in Parliament that stalled Sonia Gandhi's pet Food Security Bill on Tuesday.

The coal block allocations to 13 companies now named in FIRs in the CBI's investigation were made between 2006 and 2009.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held the coal portfolio when several of these allocations were made.

The Opposition uproar in Parliament forced the UPA to abandon attempts to introduce the Food Security Bill despite the government's elaborate preparations to bring the bill.

Parliamentary affairs minister Kamal Nath had personally called on MPs to be present and a deal had been cut with the Samajwadi Party, BSP and JD (U) that the government would be flexible over their amendments to the proposed bill.

Sonia Gandhi also had an emotional reason to get the bill introduced in Parliament on August 20: it is the birthday of her late husband, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

But the Coalgate storm spoiled the party. Sources say she is unhappy that Congress party managers and the government failed to forecast the storm over the missing Coalgate files and wants to know why preemptive action wasn't taken to minimise damage.

Mail Today had revealed in its Tuesday edition that many missing files crucial to the CBI's investigation of Coalgate belonged to companies related to a Congress MP.

CBI director Ranjit Sinha had also told Mail Today that it was a big setback to the agency's investigation.

"The Government will have to come with cogent answers. They have said some files have gone missing before 2004. There was nothing before 2004, the real problem is only of allocation post-2004," BJP leader Arun Jaitley told Mail Today.

"Why should we distract from the food bill? This is a serious matter. Destruction of evidence is a crime, has an FIR been registered?" Jaitley asked.

'A huge crime'

Asked about the missing files, he said: "It is a huge crime. The case is under investigation, how can files disappear like this?

"There are three powerful targets of investigation - the beneficiaries who benefited from coal blocks, the screening committee which allotted the mines and the minister, the minister's office and the Prime Minister's Office.

"And suddenly the files are found missing," Jaitley added.

Asked about the party's strategy, he said: "The party will have to take a collective decision."

Opposition members are worried that if the files are not found, the case being built by the CBI might collapse for want of evidence, and powerful people will be let off the hook.

Of the 13 companies against whom the CBI filed FIRs, files related to 11 are missing. These include AMR Iron & Steel Private Limited, Nagpur, which was allocated Bander block in Maharashtra on May 29, 2009.

The directors of this company - Arvind Kumar Jayaswal, Manoj Jayaswal, Ramesh Jayaswal, and Devendra Darda - have close ties to Congress MP Vijay Darda.

Another Darda company's files are also missing. The company is M/s JLD Yavatmal Energy Limited, Nagpur.

It was allocated Fatehpur East Block in Chhattisgarh on January 23, 2008. The directors are Vijay Darda, Rajendra Darda, Devendra Darda, Manoj Jayaswal, Anand Jayaswal and Abhishek Jayaswal.

Another company, M/s Vini Iron & 
Steel Udyog Limited, Kolkata, was allocated Rajhara (North, Central and 
Eastern) in Jharkhand on November 20, 2008.

The company was sold later to Vijay Joshi, a close aide of former Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda (BJP).

The
directors are Sanjeev Kumar Tulsyan, Prashant Tulsyan, Vaibhav Tulsyan,
Nisha Tulsyan, Vimal Kumar Tulsyan, Nirmala Tulsyan, Hemant Kumar 
Aggarwal and Navin Kumar.

In Parliament, the Opposition slammed the UPA government, sought a 
response from the Prime Minister and forced the adjournment of both 
Houses.

The combined 
Opposition said it was "shameful" on the part of the government and it 
should explain what exactly happened and who was responsible.

Cries of "Shame! Shame!" and "Pradhan Mantri jawab do (Prime Minister, answer)" were heard in Parliament.

In
the Lok Sabha the charge was led by Leader of the Opposition Sushma 
Swaraj who said the PM should come to the House and assure members that 
the CBI probe would not be hampered due to the missing files.

Claiming that the files included applications for coal blocks, she alleged that they have gone missing as some big shots in the Congress were involved.

Swaraj wanted the Speaker to direct the PM to come to the House and make a statement. The Opposition forced three adjournments over the issue before lunch, asking coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal to recuse himself from replying and demanding that PM Manmohan Singh make a statement.

They said propriety demands that Jaiswal abstain as the missing files reportedly relate to a beneficiary of coal block allocation who is linked to the minister.

"All efforts are being made to locate documents which are not readily available," Jaiswal said, adding that a total "769 files and documents running into 1.5 lakh pages have been handed over to the investigating agency".

Raising the issue in the Rajya Sabha, Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley referred to the Mail Today report, saying: "There are media reports that one of the beneficiaries of the coal block allocation was somebody to whom the coal minister was related.

"If files relating to that allocation are missing, should he be making a statement on those files?"

In a letter addressed to the PM, the CPI's Gurudas Dasgupta said it gives rise to serious concern that the files have been deliberately removed "so that people in high positions do not get involved and the role of the PMO does not come under the shadow of suspicion".

He urged the PM to initiate an "effective, proper and neutral" probe to discover the people "sabotaging the investigation" of the CBI.

United Opposition

Coalgate united the Opposition with the Left also supporting the demand. The CPI(M)'s Sitaram Yechury said: "The House must know how these files are missing. It is appropriate that the minister then in charge should make the statement on how the files went missing."

The committee is mandated to examine and review non-availability of files/documents and suggest appropriate action, he said, adding that it has held two meetings and documents are being located.

Amid slogan-shouting by the BJP, Jaiswal said some documents belonging to a period prior to 2004 are missing and asked who had an interest in getting the files of the pre-2004 period to go missing; he was pointing the needle of suspicion at the NDA regime.

However, the BJP members saw this as a ploy to shift the blame.
