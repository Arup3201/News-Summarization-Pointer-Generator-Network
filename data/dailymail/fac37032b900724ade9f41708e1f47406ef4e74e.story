England cricketers are used to getting a hard time Down Under – mainly at the crease.

But Eoin Morgan, the new captain of the nation’s one-day team, wasn’t prepared for the bouncer hurled at him yesterday from outside the ground.

Hours before he was due to lead out his side against Australia, the 28-year-old batsman found himself at the centre of a bizarre blackmail plot involving lurid sex messages and videos.

England cricket captain Eoin Morgan, pictured with his current girlfriend Tara Ridgway, was the focus of a £35,000 blackmail plot over a fling with an Australian woman five years ago, it was revealed today

The emails were traced to a man named by Australian media as safety consultant Nick Emery (above). He is pictured with a woman named as Brooke Tsakirakis - who is said to be at the centre of the claims

The jealous fiancé of a woman Morgan had dated five years ago threatened to reveal graphic details of the affair unless he was paid £35,000 to keep quiet.

Nick Emery said he would release ‘sexually-based’ messages and videos featuring Morgan unless he was paid the money before the start of England’s match today.

The safety consultant from Tasmania said he had come across ‘some interesting Skype calls’ between his fiancée – understood to be Brooke Tsakirakis – and Morgan.

Emery told reporters: ‘I have got a fair bit of interesting content regarding Eoin Morgan with a woman who isn’t his girlfriend ... there’s sexual content. It’s my partner.’ 

The England Cricket Board said it had received an email, demanding money be paid or details of Morgan's previous relationship, including videos, would be given to both the UK and Australian press.

In one interview with the Australian press yesterday, Emery claimed he had found compromising messages between the pair from just last year.

Morgan, who has been dating Australian model and law student Tara Ridgway for the last three years, is understood to have had a relationship with Miss Tsakirakis five years ago while he was playing cricket in Australia.

Yesterday the England and Wales Cricket Board took the extraordinary step of releasing details of the plot amid fears that speculation surrounding the dalliance could disrupt the match.

The board also disputed Emery’s claim that there was some kind of relationship between the pair last year, insisting that the dalliance took place five years ago when both parties were single.

Dublin-born Morgan, who was made captain of the one-day side last month, was due to lead the team out in Hobart at 3am, UK time, today. 

The ECB immediately told Scotland Yard of the blackmail plot after receiving two emails from Emery. UK detectives then tracked him down within 24 hours with the help of colleagues in Australia.

After meeting ECB officials and Australian police officers, Emery said he had made a mistake because he was in a ‘bad head space’. 

Speaking to the Melbourne-based Herald Sun newspaper, he said: ‘It’s done. It’s dealt with. I did the wrong thing in the wrong state of mind.

‘I wanted to catch her out in a big way. I was in a very angry and bad head space. Everything is sorted now. They were very understanding. We came to an agreement.’ 

He said he had stumbled upon the messages when his partner backed up her phone on his computer. Emery added: ‘It was a stupid mistake on her behalf. I knew something went on between them a long time ago.’

He said he had called Morgan’s number to confirm it was the cricketer, but had not confronted either of them. 

The blackmailer gave no indication to his friends or family about what he was planning to do. Instead, he posted a picture of himself and Miss Tsakirakis smiling on his Facebook page last week.

The couple are thought to have met during the 2010/11 Ashes series in Australia, which England went on to with 3-1

In October he wrote: ‘This time one year ago I met this hottie for a coffee. 12 months on we still meet for coffee, every morning in the kitchen. She keeps me real, she believes in me and I love her loads.’

A month later he announced their engagement over Facebook.

His fiancée is not thought to have known about the plot until police became involved. 

Yesterday Paul Downton, managing director of the ECB, said: ‘There were references to a relationship that Eoin Morgan had five years ago with a single Australian lady. It was a brief relationship and what appears to be a fairly deliberate attempt to extort a sum of money from the ECB.

‘The individual, who comes from Hobart, demanded that the money be paid before the first ball was played on Friday.

‘The suspect has been identified as an Australian resident of Hobart who is the new boyfriend of the woman Morgan dated five years ago. The individual is understood to have found a phone with details of Morgan’s relationship.

‘He has now apologised saying it was not intended to go this far.’

Mr Downton said the ECB would not be pressing charges against Emery. Police declined to comment.
