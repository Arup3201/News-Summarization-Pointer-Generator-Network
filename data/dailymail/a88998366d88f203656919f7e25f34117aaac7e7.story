But come January, presenter Clare Balding will go head to head with Tom Daley as the sporting duo host rival reality TV shows.

Diving heartthrob Tom, 18, who won bronze at London 2012, will star in a new ITV reality show, Splash!

The five-part series, hosted by Vernon Kay and Gabby Logan, pitches 15 unlikely celebrities against each other in a series of dive-offs.

But it will be in direct competition with Britain's Brightest - 41-year-old Clare's new reality series for the BBC.

The knockout tournament hosted by the Olympic commentary queen will see 24 contestants tackle a variety of challenges and puzzles.

Shows in the six-part series will start five minutes before Splash!

Meanwhile in Splash! stars trained by Tom will attempt to impress the judges with backflips, somersaults and pike dives.

Rumours: TOWIE's Joey Essex and Girls Aloud star Cheryl Cole are both rumoured to be taking part in Splash!

ITV bosses last night remained tight lipped over the show's celebrity line-up, but TOWIE star Joey Essex, stand-up comedian Omid Djalili, Eddie 'the Eagle' Edwards and even Cheryl Cole are all rumoured to be taking part.

Cheryl famously asked Tom to teach her how to swan dive in a tweet last August.

Training has begun in earnest and Tom has been seen at work with his proteges at a Plymouth swimming pool.
