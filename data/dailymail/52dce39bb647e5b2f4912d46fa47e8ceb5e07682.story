Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg says splitting the housework benefits men and children as well as women.

'In many cases, getting to 50/50 is not just the fair thing to do, but the better thing to do for a family,' writes Sheryl, 44, in the foreword to a new book, Getting to 50/50: How Working Parents Can Have It All.

She suggests that allowing men to take on their share of chores provides women with more choices, and that the 'bonus... extends to the men themselves and their children as well'.

The mother-of-two admits she and husband David Goldberg struggle to attain 'perfect equality'.

'We have two children and we aim for a 50/50 split in childcare and household duties,' she says.

'Even though my husband Dave and I are lucky and can afford exceptional childcare, there are still difficult decisions about how much time our jobs require us to be away from our family and who will pick up the slack when the other canâ€™t be there.

'We are rarely at 50/50 at any given moment - perfect equality is hard to define, or sustain - but that remains the goal as the pendulum swings between us.'

Sandberg writes about her struggle to achieve total equality in the foreword to new hit book Getting to 50/50

The new book, published in Britain next month, is authored former executive at Goldman Sachs Sharon Meers, and Joanna Strober, who works in private equity.

It is already a hit in American with working women and their partners.

Meers and Strober argue that only when husbands commit to taking on exactly half of all chores and childcare can a family truly thrive, reports the Sunday Times.

Sandberg gained international recognition following the publication of her best-selling book Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead, which talks about women's struggles in the male-dominated workplace and advises women to 'lean in' to reach their true potential.
