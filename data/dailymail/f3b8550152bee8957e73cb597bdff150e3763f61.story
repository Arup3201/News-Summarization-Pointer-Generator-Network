Ministers were last night accused of being 'asleep on the job' for failing to act faster to combat a disease that could devastate the nation's woodlands.

The new Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson, was asked to explain why he is only now banning imports of ash trees when a fungus that kills them was first found in a British tree nursery in February.

Ash die-back, caused by the fungus chalara fraxinea, has wiped out 90 per cent of ash trees in Denmark and is widespread in central Europe.

Banning imports: Ash tree imports from Europe will be banned from Monday due to a fungus, which causes leaf loss and crown dieback, which is becoming widespread in Europe

Ash dieback had previously been identified in nurseries and recently planted sites including a car park, a college campus and new woodland, but has now been found in the wider environment at sites in East Anglia, increasing fears it could wreak the same kind of damage as Dutch elm disease in the 1970s.

Mr Paterson told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ‘I will bring in a ban on Monday, having discussed this over the weekend with officials and experts.

‘I have already prepared the legislation and we are ready to go. The evidence is clearly there.’

The president of the Country Land and Business Association, Harry Cotterell, welcomed the import ban but said it may not be enough to stop an epidemic.

With chalara fraxinea already present in woods in Norfolk and Suffolk, Britain faces the threat one of the best-loved features of its landscape, he said.

Mr Cotterell said: ‘We are very pleased to hear that the ban is going to be announced on Monday.

'National tragedy': Ash trees make up around 30 per cent of the wooded landscape and the fungus has already been discovered in at least 11 woods in Norfolk and Suffolk

‘I think the real concern is that geographically, it looks like the disease may have arrived into the wild on the wind.’

Asked if the ban would make a difference to the spread of the disease, he said: ‘It may not. It depends on the extent to which we find the disease in the wild throughout the rest of the country. 

‘It has already have been discovered in at least 11 woods in Norfolk and Suffolk.’

It was ‘a great pity’ that the discovery of the disease in Britain in spring was not announced at the time.

He said: ‘It wouldn’t have made a great deal of difference banning imports in the spring, because most of the imports would have taken place.

‘But we certainly should have been told about it in the spring.

‘It’s a great pity that we weren’t told about it until two or three weeks ago, whereas it clearly had been discovered in nursery stock and young trees in the spring. I think we could have started looking for it - the real concern is to find out the true extent of it.’

‘If the ash stock in the countryside is devastated, it will be a national tragedy.’ 

In the UK, ash trees make up around 30 per cent of the wooded landscape, across woodlands, hedgerows and parks.

The Woodland Trust has called for an emergency summit or taskforce to be set up by the Government to tackle tree diseases, before another species is lost for good.

The Forestry Commission is urging forest managers and tree professionals to use the information on its website about the disease, inspect trees again and report any suspected to be infected.

As a precaution, the Commission is suspending the planting of ash trees in public forests it manages.

The Horticultural Trades Association has also urged members to abide by a voluntary moratorium on importing ash trees for planting in this country.

Mr Paterson said that the import ban would be accompanied by very strict movement restrictions on ash trees already in the country, to prevent the danger of spreading the disease to areas of the country which have not yet been affected.

He denied that the Government had acted slowly since the disease was first detected in the UK in February, pointing out that more than 1,000 sites had already been checked and 50,000 trees burnt.

Mr Paterson, who was appointed Environment Secretary in David Cameron’s September reshuffle, told Today: ‘The disease was first identified in a nursery in Buckinghamshire on February 24 during a routine inspection.

‘It was then confirmed on March 7 and through the summer a very detailed process has gone on of identifying where the trees have come from and where they have gone. During this process, more than 1,000 sites have been investigated and 50,000 trees have already been burnt.

Ash dieback is a serious disease of ash trees caused by a fungus called Chalara fraxinea (C. fraxinea). The disease causes leaf loss and crown dieback in affected trees, as pictured right, and it can lead to tree death.

European trees now believed to have been infected with this newly identified pathogen were first reported dying in large numbers in Poland in 1992 and it spread rapidly to other European countries.

However, it was 2006 before the fungus’s asexual stage, C. fraxinea, was first described by scientists, and 2010 before its sexual stage, Hymenoscyphus pseudo-albidus, was described.

In February 2012 it was found in a consignment of infected trees sent from a nursery in the Netherlands to a nursery in Buckinghamshire.

Since then it has been found in a number of locations and situations in England and Scotland, including a car park in Leicester; a Forestry Commission Scotland woodland at Knockmountain, near Kilmacolm, west of Glasgow; a college campus in South Yorkshire; and a property in County Durham.

He said: ‘When I came in in September, a consultation with the industry had just started and I made absolutely sure it took as short a time as possible.

‘Over the weekend, I will be talking to experts who will already have prepared, on my instruction, legislation so if the evidence shows it is necessary, and I think it will, we will bring in a ban on Monday morning.’

The chief executive of the Woodland Trust, Sue Holden, said: ‘We are clearly pleased to see Owen Paterson finally taking action to introduce a ban on the import of ash trees in to the UK.

‘We would also urge the Secretary of State to ban the movement of ash around the UK until the extent of ash dieback, and how it is spread, has been determined. 

‘We also ask Government scientists to give urgent and clear advice to all woodland owners on how to manage the disease. The Trust will do all it can to mitigate spread in line with this Government instruction and advice.

‘We must stress however, that ash dieback is only one of numerous tree pests and diseases present in the UK. ‘With more than 15 separate pests and diseases listed on the Forestry Commission website as already present, it is crucial that the wider issue is tackled.

‘The Government must set up an emergency summit bringing together representatives from all areas of forestry, plant health and conservation because today it’s ash but tomorrow yet another of our precious native trees could be at risk.’
