This time last year at Gillingham we sat four points clear at the top of League Two, but it got mentioned on several occasions that the players looked edgy, nervous and were playing with fear.

On Wednesday night I was at Anfield, kindly invited by Brendan Rodgers for Liverpool's game against Sunderland.

The fans sung their hearts out, they appealed for every decision, they lauded every tackle. But the more they did that, the more passes went astray and the less the players moved with the speed and fluidity they are used to.

Back in top form: Jordan Henderson netted Liverpool's fourth goal against Tottenham on Sunday

The wobbles had set in at Anfield.

They managed to hang on for the victory, but were not jumping for joy. It was sighs of relief to get three more points on the table.

It happens at all levels and you can't do anything about it, but you get better at dealing with it and taking the pressure off your players as much as you can.

Chelsea got the wobbles when they slipped up against Crystal Palace on Saturday.

When I talk to my players I always use the example of Amen Corner at the Augusta Masters when we see what happens to the world's very best golfers. We sit, with our feet tucked up on the sofa, watching them hook and slice, duffing chips and fluffing putts on the billiard table greens.

But Liverpool did anything but wobble as they took apart Tottenham to move top of the table. That's the 20th time the lead has changed hands this season.

There will be plenty more twists and turns through to the end of the season though, as the jelly wobbles set in.

PATHETIC PLANE PLAN BACKFIRES

How pathetic and idiotic can you get, hiring an aeroplane with a negative message about David Moyes? After every game all everyone talks about nowadays is when Moyes will get the sack and that everyone wants him out.

Yes, he has made mistakes. Yes, he has made errors in the transfer market. But he's taken over from the most successful and longest-serving manager in world football.

The shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson and how he did things will be looming large all over Old Trafford and and in every corner at Carrington, day in and day out.

Golden boy: Wayne Rooney netted twice for Manchester United against Aston Villa at Old Trafford

Point taken: Moyes' Manchester United side battered the Villans 4-1 at Old Trafford

Standing strong: There has been mounting pressure to take down the 'CHOSEN ONE' banner

Unhelpful: Fans commissioned a banner calling for Moyes' job to fly over the ground on match day

It will take a couple of years for Moyes to put his own imprint on the whole club and it will take him time to adjust from managing a big club like Everton to managing a global institution like Manchester United.

At least the real fans showed their support by applauding Moyes on to the pitch at Old Trafford and booing the plane.

What better way to reward them than with a 4-1 win against Aston Villa.

BORE OFF, BOO BOYS

The supporters at West Ham were also having a go at their manager Sam Allardyce despite winning a game.

I must admit I was not there to see it, but I read that the performance against Hull that evening was not good.

After three defeats and the teams at the bottom catching up, the only important thing is to win, whether it be with pretty passing triangles or 11 behind the ball against 10 men.

Staying in the Premier League for West Ham is worth millions of pounds and Karren Brady knows when she does her spread sheets that, with Allardyce, top flight survival is nailed on year after year.

Do they want to change a style and risk that much money?

It reminds me of last year at Gillingham when some middle-aged gentleman at the end of a game leaned over, pointed his finger straight at me, and said: 'Allen you're a f****** muppet and you don't know what you're doing.'

At the time, we were four points clear at the top of the league.

Thankfully, I controlled myself, didn't turn back and just kept walking forward.

Of course, the temptation was to do a Cantona on him, but that would've been Mad.

TIME TO STEP UP

I still cannot get my head around how more footballers have not opened up about being gay.

Nowadays in society I can't imagine anybody would care one little bit and I include team-mates, supporters, owners, and anyone else.

I hope the law change over the weekend to allow same-sex marriages to take place will help the first Premier League player to step up.

Let's be honest, who's bothered?

MY WEEK...

My Saturday afternoons whilst I've been between jobs have often been spent relaxing.

I'd usually take a stroll walking my dog Monty before going to a local hotel leisure club.

There I'd do a few lengths, enjoy a steam and a sauna, and then grab as many newspapers as I could and have a read.

Generally chillaxing, as I like to put it.

Open: American Robbie Rogers is one of the few openly gay professional footballers

Back in the game: Allen is loving life as Barnet manager after a roller coaster couple of weeks in charge

There would be no anxiety about a refereeing decision, no anger about a defeat when we should've won, it was all about calm and quiet.

Well, in the past two weeks since I've returned to Barnet as manager there couldn't have been a greater contrast between the man going through 95 minutes in the technical area and the whale laid by the pool.

Our 2-0 win against Hereford and a draw on Saturday, away at second-placed Cambridge, has kept Barnet in with an outside chance of sneaking into the play-offs.

I'd take this excited stress any day.
