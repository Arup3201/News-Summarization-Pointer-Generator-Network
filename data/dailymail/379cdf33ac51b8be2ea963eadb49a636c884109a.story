The sidekick who helped the Washington D.C. sniper slay 10 people and wound at least six more in a 2002 rampage has claimed he was sexually abused by the killing spree's mastermind.

Lee Boyd Malvo, who was 17 when he indiscriminately shot his victims over a period of three weeks, claimed John Allen Muhammad molested him for more than two years.

Speaking to Today in what he said would be his last interview about the crimes, Malvo said: 'For the entire period when I was almost 15 until I got arrested, I was sexually abused by John Muhammad.'

Malvo, who is now 27, is serving a 
life sentence in a south Virginia prison without the possibility of 
parole. Muhammad was put to death by lethal injection in 2009, at age 
48.

Today host Matt Lauer quizzed the 
murderer about why he had made the molestation claims now, when he had 
previously denied a sexual relationship between the pair.

'I
felt a sense of shame, and I just said, "Thatâ€™s just something that I'd
never tell anyone",' Malvo explained in the interview which aired on 
Thursday morning.

'And 
to a certain extent, up until that point, I really couldn't handle it. 
The main reason I'm coming forward now is because I am more mature.'

He added that solitary confinement has forced him to deal with the past on his own.

'In here, there's no therapy,' he said. 
'Rehabilitation is just a word. In solitary confinement, in a cell by 
yourself, I am priest, doctor, therapist. So it just worked out that I 
just took it off piece by piece.'

Malvo was born in Jamaica and moved to Antigua with his family in 1999, where he first met Muhammad.

Speaking to Today, Malvo said that 
Muhammad, who he described as a 'good listener', quickly gained his 
trust by being the loving figure he had craved.

Malvo claimed he was sexually abused by a
babysitter at the age of five and then relatives at the age of eight 
before he came Muhammad's victim aged 15.

On October 2, 2002, the pair began their killing spree, gunning down people in the D.C. area.

'I couldn't say no,' Malvo explained. 'I had wanted that level of love and acceptance and consistency for all my life and couldn't find it. I didn't have the willpower to say no.'

The terror ended on October 24, 2002, when police caught Muhammad and Malvo as they slept at a Maryland rest stop in a car they had outfitted for a shooter to perch in its boot without being seen.

When they were hauled into custody, Malvo said his first thought was not for himself.

'I was intent on protecting Mr Muhammad as best as I could,' he said. 'Death is not what I feared the most. I feared letting him down
more than I feared death.'

Malvo was sentenced to life in prison without parole for killing Linda Franklin, a 47-year-old FBI analyst who was shot as she and her husband loaded supplies at a Home Depot in Virginia.

The men were also suspected of fatal shootings in Louisiana, Alabama and Arizona.

Malvo, who said he has forgiven himself for his heinous crimes, said his punishment of solitary confinement has been effective, calling it 'complete deprivation'.

The motive for the attacks remains murky. Malvo said Muhammad wanted to extort $10 million from the government to set up a camp in Canada where homeless children would be trained as terrorists.

Muhammad's ex-wife said she believes they were a smoke screen for his plan to kill her and regain custody of their three children.

Malvo claimed in a Washington Post interview last month that Muhammad had 'brainwashed' him.

Lauer asked Malvo if they had gunned 
down other people who had never been identified and he responded that 
there were - and that he had admitted as much to police.

He said he has contacted the families of five of these victims, 'but there was a point in time where 
psychologically, I couldn't handle it. I cannot afford to break down 
psychologically in here, because there will be no help.'

When Lauer asked him what advice he would give to his victims' families, he responded: 'Please do not allow my actions and the actions of Muhammad to hold you hostage and continue to victimse you for the rest of your life. Do not give me or him that much power.'
