Jenny Lauren, niece of fashion designer Ralph Lauren, had her alleged drunken meltdown on a transatlantic flight because she has a 'long history' of anxiety on planes, a close friend said today.

Melanie Beck said that Jenny could have turned to drink to calm her deep rooted 'fear of flight'.

She said that Jenny, 41, usually flew 1st Class and that Delta, the airline on which she was flying, could have served her too much booze.

Lauren is accused of breaching the peace on the flight, which had to be diverted to Shannon Airport in Ireland yesterday, and appeared in court on charges of being drunk and abusive on a 
plane.

In defense: Melanie Beck used to live with Jenny Lauren in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when she was recovering from the eating disorder and said the two have a 'long history' together

But Ms Beck claimed that the incident
 was just a one off and her friend had 'matured' from the days when 
anorexia controlled her life - with no intention of going back.

Ms
 Beck used to live with Jenny in Santa Fe, New Mexico when she was 
recovering from the eating disorder and said the two have a 'long 
history' together.

She said that Jenny had been in Barcelona recently and her posts on Facebook suggested she was having a great time.

Ms
 Beck said: 'It's inexplicable. She's not in a dark place, she has long 
outgrown that. I think that she has a history of anxiety on airplanes.

'I
 think that's true. She has had a long history of fear of flying. She 
could have been drinking to ease that. I think that's how most people 
drink on planes (to ease anxiety).

'She was probably overserved. Maybe its the airline's fault.'

Dressed in a smart black dress, coat and boots, the New York-based jewellery designer wept before the hearing and then clutched her hands as she appeared before Killaloe District Court

Ms Lauren was arrested off the plane at Shannon Airport yesterday afternoon and held in custody overnight

Lauren's
 old friend added the person Jenny describes in her memoir - it features
 a frank account of her battle with anorexia - is the person she was 
'years ago'  and that she is a 'grown woman now'.

Ms Beck admitted that her friend had a 'lot of explosive energy' when she was younger but she claimed that was 'years ago'.

She
 said that when Jenny used to live in her home in Santa Fe together, 
which was more than a year ago, they traveled on long haul flights 
together including to Brazil with no issues.

Jenny would pay for her to go first class - one of the perks would have been as much alcohol as they wanted.

Ms
 Beck said: 'This doesn't seem like the Jenny that I know. She is a 
sophisticated woman. Totally sophisticated. 'I've travelled many places 
around the world and I have never seen her act out on an airplane or in a
 restaurant or a public place like that. I'm shocked.'

Dressed
 in a smart black dress, coat and boots, the New York-based jewellery 
designer wept before her court hearing and then clutched her hands as 
she appeared before Killaloe District Court.

The unusual sitting was held in the 
downstairs function room of the Brian Boru pub - named after the ancient
 High King of Ireland - as there is no dedicated courthouse in the area.

Ms Lauren sat only feet away from Guinness and Heineken taps and under switched off disco lights as her name was called out in the licenced premises which was not in operation today.

Ms Lauren was arrested off the plane at Shannon Airport yesterday afternoon and held in custody overnight.

Garda
 Yvette Walsh told the court that when the jewellery designer was being 
detained at the airport she told officers: 'Can you say that in English 
please?'

Jenny Lauren
 first began to make jewellery after a manager from Urban Zen, a boutique founded with the help of Ralph Lauren's rival Donna Karan, admired her work. Unaware of her design pedigree, the Sag Harbor, N.Y., store offered her  a trunk show.

She was raised in Manhattan and her father Jerry is the executive vice president for men’s design at the Ralph Lauren fashion house.

Her mother Susan died from lung cancer in October 2008.

She has two older brothers: Brad, who
 is in the restaurant business, and Greg Lauren, an artist, who is 
married to Dancing With The Stars contestant and former Saved By The Bell star Elizabeth Berkley.

She is said to be close to her first cousins, Ralph's children, including David, the executive vice president for global advertising, marketing and communications at Ralph Lauren; Dylan, the owner of 'the largest candy store in the world', and Andrew, a film producer.

Jenny Lauren battled an eating disorder and 
related health problems during her younger years which she documented in a 2004 book, 'Homesick: A Memoir of Family, Food and 
Finding Hope.

Her uncle, born Ralph Lifshitz in New York in 1939, is the man behind the 
world-renowned Polo Ralph Lauren brand and the 162nd richest person in 
the world.

He has an estimated wealth of $7.7billion after starting off selling ties in Manhattan in the 1960s.

Last year alone, his company reported revenues of $6.9billion.

Judge Patrick 
Durcan heard Ms Lauren was ready to enter a plea to three separate 
charges but he refused to rule on the case in full and said the plea to 
the charges would be dealt with at a second hearing tomorrow at Ennis 
District Court.

At the hearing in the pub near the banks of the River Shannon, Lauren, of East 65th Street in New York, swore an oath on a Bible before speaking only to confirm her name, nationality and that she only has one passport.

She became emotional and wiped away tears as she spoke with friends before the hearing.

Lauren owns a jewellery line called Jenny Lauren Jewellery

The US national was granted bail on condition she stays at a hotel in Shannon town with her travelling companions and lodges 2,500 euro ($3,400/£2,075) of her own money to the court.

She has been ordered to sign on at Shannon Garda Station tonight and surrender her passport.

Judge Durcan had refused an initial offer of an 800 euro ($1088/£664) lodgement by solicitor Sharon Curley.

He warned that he would have to take account of the nature and extent of the inconvenience to other people, as well as the costs incurred by Delta Air Lines, airport and other passengers.

'These are the issues that will have to be addressed and the court will have to be satisfied before they can be discharged,' he said.

The judge asked for an assessment on how much the disruption has cost the airline, airport and passengers before dealing with Lauren's plea at the hearing tomorrow.

The downstairs function room of the Brian Boru on the Hill pub is in Ballina, Co Tipperary - one of the twin towns where the ancient High King of Ireland was born.

He ruled from Killaloe, on the other side of the Shannon, from 1002-1014, making it the Capital of Ireland.

The licensed premises was packed for the day's court sittings, with the bar area cordoned off with wire mesh.

A representative from the US Embassy in Ireland also met Lauren at the police station yesterday and appeared in the makeshift court to support her.

Lauren was charged with being intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that she might endanger herself or other persons on board the aircraft.

She was accused of engaging in behavior likely to cause serious offence or annoyance to any person on board the aircraft, after being asked by a crew member to stop.'

Lauren also faced a count of breaching the peace by engaging in threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour.

She left the licensed premises in a black 4x4 and covered face as she ducked past photographers into the vehicle.

The
 case is due to be heard again tomorrow at Ennis District Court where 
sentencing will be decided on a guilty plea from Lauren.

More 
than 200 passengers and crew were on board the flight from Barcelona to 
New York when the alleged air rage incident took place.

She
 spent last night in a cell in Shannon Garda Station, where she made no 
reply when charged under the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1973.

The flight was able to continue its journey to New York just over two hours after touchdown.

Her company Jenny Lauren Jewellery operates in the US and sells items prices from $350 to $5,000.

Speaking from his Manhattan apartment, Jenny Lauren's brother Brad said he was unaware of the incident - but was not surprised.

He said: 'That seems like Jenny. She can be explosive with her temper. I don't know what could cause her to snap. She just has an explosive personality.'

Brad Lauren, 46, said that he did not believe his sister's demons were coming back to haunt her and that it was just her temper that was to blame.

He said: 'Things are going really well for her...The jewelry business is terrific, everything is really good. I know that she was in Europe for the holidays but I don't know anything else.'

Brad Lauren added that his sister would be 'very embarrassed by this' and would be glad to get back to New York.
