Prince Harry was left holding the baby during a surprise visit to athletes gearing up for next month's Invictus Games at Lee Valley on Tuesday.

With the baby, the son of one of the Invictus Games management team, balanced on his arm, the prince seemed relaxed - and certainly didn't appear too worried about dropping him.

Beside him was the Duke of Cambridge, the royal family's resident childcare expert, who beamed as the baby held on to his fingers.

The photos, which were released on Twitter following the visit, also included a series showing the royal visitors with athletes preparing for the Invictus Games next month.

Inspired by the Warrior Games which see wounded servicemen from the U.S navy, air force and army compete in a variety of track and field sports, the first British version will see more than 400 competitors from 14 different countries go head-to-head in venues across London.

Harry has spent much of the last few months promoting the Games, even agreeing to a rare interview on Radio 2 last week in which he spoke of his pride in the event and his wish to repeat it for 'as long as it's needed'.

The Games, which open on the 10th September, will also feature a celebrity-studded closing ceremony courtesy of a concert headlined by the Foo Fighters and the Kaiser Chiefs.

Medals for the Games have also been unveiled,  with gold, silver and bronze medals created especially for the event by jewellers Garrard.

Along with their visit to Lee Valley, both the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry have spent the week highlighting the work of other military charities, among them Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion.

During a visit to the Tower of London on Tuesday morning, both planted ceramic poppies in the moat for the installation Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, which will eventually include 888,246 flowers - one for every British and Commonwealth soldier killed in World War One.

Once the exhibition comes to an end on the 11th November, the poppies will be sold for £25 each, with proceeds going to military charities.
