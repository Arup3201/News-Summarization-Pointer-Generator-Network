Rangers midfielder Fraser Aird claims he would rather watch Coronation Street than Scottish Championship title rivals Hearts.

Rangers, who travel to Dumbarton on Saturday, will be at least six points behind Hearts when Robbie Neilson's men take on Hibernian at Easter Road in Sunday's televised derby.

But Aird will not be taking the chance to keep an eye on their promotion rivals.

The midfielder has taunted  Hearts by saying he would rather watch Coronation Street than the Edinburgh side

'I probably won't watch the derby,' said the teenager. 'Chelsea are playing Manchester United so I'm looking forward to that. I think that's a better game to look forward to.

'I have a few mates that play for [Hearts] and I always go and check their results. But if they are playing on the TV and there is nothing else on, I'd probably go and watch Coronation Street before I do that.'

Rangers manager Ally McCoist had to warn defender Bilel Mohsni about his pre-match comments after the Tunisian wrote off Hibs' title chances just days before Alan Stubbs' men stunned Rangers with a 3-1 win in Glasgow.

Rangers boss Ally McCoist said Aird's comments were  meant in jest and should not be taken too seriously

But this time McCoist played down the 19-year-old's comments.

'The wee man is entitled to his opinion,' McCoist said. 'I would personally prefer to watch any game of football than Coronation Street but I would imagine his words were said a little bit tongue-in-cheek.'
