Alex Salmond today tried to laugh off complaints about his decision to unfurl a Scottish Saltire in Centre Court, insisting Wimbledon rules were there to be broken.

The Scottish First Minister was accused of staging a political stunt by smuggling the flag in his wife's handbag before waving around behind David Cameron's head as Andy Murray secured his historic win.

He insisted no-one sticks to the rule banning large flags around Centre Court, and after waiting 117 years for a Scot to win the men's singles 'a few Saltires hoisted over Wimbledon doesn’t really harm at all'.

PR stunt? Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond waving a giant Scottish flag, breaking Wimbledon spectator rules

What have you got there? The First Minister looks set to unfurl his giant Saltire as David Cameron glances behind to see what's going on

The stunt was seen as particularly controversial coming less than 18 months before Scotland votes on leaving the rest of the United Kingdom.

Some will hope that Mr Salmond's push for independence will be bolstered by Murray's victory over Novak Djokovic in straight sets last night.

But his decision to wave the blue and white Scottish flag around was not seen as being particularly statesmanlike, hiding a flag in the handbag of his wife Moira.

The moment the nation was gripped by Andy Murray's historic Wimbledon victory, the First Minister of Scotland was rummaging in his wife's handbag.

Alex Salmond knew a Scot triumphing in the greatest tennis contest on earth presented him with a PR coup and he was going to take it.

Even better was the chance to dangle the Saltire behind David Cameron's head.

But the row that has erupted is about more than whether it was statesmanlike behaviour.

On 18 September 2014 Scotland will stage a referendum on leaving the United Kingdom after 300 years, and Mr Salmond is desperate to prove an independent Scotland can compete on the world stage.

He will hope that Murray's victory will bolster his chances of reversing dire opinion polls which suggest his dream of independence will be defeated.

Murray has refused to be drawn on it, insisting he wants to 'read more about the issue'.

The vast Saltire also appeared to far exceed All England Club rules which forbid flags more than 2ft by 2ft.

The regulations also ban objects or 
clothing bearing political statements or commercial identification 
intended for ‘ambush marketing’.

But Mr Salmond claimed no-one stuck to the rules. 'I think a rule more observed in its breaking than its observation.

'But can I just point out, the All 
England Club didn’t mind in the slightest, they’re really nice people, 
and if the All England Club didn’t mind, I really don’t think anybody 
else should either.'

He also argued he should be given some leeway, with Murray the first Scot to win Wimbledon for 117 years.

Mr Salmond told BBC Radio 4's Today 
programme: 'You’ve just been saying about it’s the first triumph since 
Fred Perry in 77 years.

'It’s the first Scot since Harold 
Mahony in 1896 – it’s not something that happens very often, so I think a
few saltires hoisted over Wimbledon doesn’t really harm at all.

'This was after the match was 
finished, incidentally. This was part of the celebration.

'And the answer
is no, I am not responsible for the seating arrangements in the royal 
box.

'I had the flag last year, actually – I just didn’t get the chance 
to wave it last year.'

However the incident provoked a flurry of 
comment on Twitter, where it was described as an instance of 
‘photo-bombing’ – when someone spoils a photo by sneaking into the 
frame, usually to poke fun at somebody.

Mr Salmond insisted he had not planned to target Mr Cameron, adding: 'I had no idea what the seating arrangements were - that is absolutely the case.'

But Education Secretary Michael Gove suggested it was inappropriate behaviour for Wimbledon's Royal Box.

He told LBC 97.3: 'I think there is a difference between how you might behave in the Royal Box in Wimbledon and how you might behave in Hampden if a Scottish football team were to win.

'I think it was a wee bit of a stunt... my advice to Alex would just be "Put it away dear".'

'Bit sad': Alex Salmond's flag-waving antics attracted some criticism on Twitter from fellow politicians including the former deputy prime minister John Prescott

It is 77 years since a British man - Fred Perry - won a Wimbledon singles title.

But it is 117 years since a Sctosman, Harold Mahony, triumphed - giving Alex Salmond the chance to whip out his Saltire.

Mahony was born in Edinburgh in 1867 but spent most of his life in Ireland.

At his Wimbledon debut in 1890 he crashed out in the first round, reaching the semis in 1891 and 1892.

He took time out to train in America before returning to defeat Englishman Wilfred Baddeley in the final, 6–2, 6–8, 5–7, 8–6, 6–3.

He went on to win a silver medal in the men's singles at the 1900 Paris Olympics.

Former deputy prime minister John Prescott wrote on Twitter: ‘Alex Salmond photo-bombing David Cameron. Bit sad wasn’t it?’

BBC reporter Jon Sopel joked: ‘Alex Salmond waves a Saltire from Royal Box. Is there a referendum coming?’

Journalist Matthew d’Ancona posted: ‘Alex Salmond is usually a consummate politician.

'But today he was a grade-one wally.’

Comedian Brian ‘Limmy’ Limond wrote: ‘I’m pro-independence, but put the flag away Salmond - f****** grow up.’

He added: ‘Imagine Cameron scrambling for the Union Flag. Clumsy.’

Songwriter Roddy Hart asked on Twitter: ‘No matter how genuine or heartfelt, surely Salmond reaching for the Saltire whilst cameras watching would be seen as opportunistic?’

Mark Ferguson, editor of Labour website LabourList wrote: ‘Anyone spot Alex Salmond waving the Saltire behind Cameron’s head? Obvious what he was trying to do. You’ve got no class Salmond, no class.’

Labour peer George Foulkes said there is a ‘time and place’ for such a stunt.

But Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon leapt to the defence of her boss.

‘Hey folks, waving the Saltire isn’t political,’ she wrote on her Twitter account. ‘It’s showing enormous pride that a boy from Dunblane just won Wimbledon.’

Mr Salmond later hailed Murray as the
'King of Scotland' whose victory over Novak Djokavic in straight sets 
may be the 'pinnacle of Scottish sporting triumph'.

Speaking
on Good Morning Scotland, Mr Salmond said: 'It's right up there, it's 
up there with Chris Hoy, or Celtic and the European Cup.

'It's
an amazing victory. Paul Lawrie, Sandy Lyle in the Open. It's probably 
the pinnacle. He says it's the pinnacle of tennis, this might be the 
pinnacle of Scottish sporting triumph.

'It's an absolutely astonishing triumph.'

Mr Salmond also revealed he is planning further celebrations in Scotland to capitalise on Murray's extraordinary victory.

When asked what plans there were to 
honour the sportsman, Mr Salmond added: 'He's already got the freedom of
Stirling.

'I was thinking of a reception in Stirling Castle, which has 
got a nice sort of home town ring to it with Dunblane, something like 
that.

'But Andy is king of Scotland, he can have anything he likes.'

Criticism: Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott was one of the first to ridicule Mr Salmond's flag stunt

Gaffe: Broadcaster Iain Dale thought it was funny that the TV cameras did not linger on the Saltire

Twitter user David Birch suggested an Englishman staged a similar stunt

Dark side: Political scientist Philip Cowley posted this joke on Twitter

Greeting: The two men appeared to exchange friendly words as they took their seats in the royal box to watch Murray take on Djokovic

Concentration: Mr Salmond and Mr Cameron watched from the royal box as the two finalists battled it out in sweltering heat on Centre Court

Should Andy Murray be given a knighthood for winning Wimbledon?

Mr Salmond’s spokesman earlier defended 
the decision to take a large Saltire into Centre Court said: ‘Scotland 
feels enormous pride that a young man from Dunblane has won Wimbledon.

'With flags of all kinds flying around 
Wimbledon and even a Saltire above Downing St, one extra Saltire among a
sea of flags seems like a fair way to celebrate.’

The All England Club declined to comment on the incident.

Murray was criticised after joking 
before the 2006 World Cup that he would be supporting anyone other than 
England in the competition.

He has not indicated which way he 
will vote in next year’s referendum on Scottish independence, but he 
warned his countrymen not to let their heart rule their head.

In an interview with Scotland on 
Sunday earlier this year, he said: ‘I want to read more about the issue.

'I don’t think you should judge the thing on emotion, but on what is 
best economically for Scotland.’
