As a self-proclaimed ‘history nerd’, American popstar Kelly Clarkson was happy to pay more than £150,000 for a ring that once belonged to Jane Austen.

But the 31-year-old singer has been told she cannot take the item out of Britain and back to her native Texas because it is a ‘national treasure’.

Miss Clarkson, the first winner of talent show American Idol, saw off seven bidders in an auction at Sotheby’s last year for the gold and turquoise ring.

Still in its original box, it was sold for £152,450 despite being expected to fetch only £30,000.

But when she applied for an export licence, a reviewing committee recommended that the ring should be kept in the UK.

Culture Secretary Ed Vaizey has placed a temporary export bar on the item in the hope a UK buyer can be found to purchase it.

He said: ‘Jane Austen’s modest lifestyle and her early death mean that objects associated with her of any kind are extremely rare, so I hope this simple but elegant ring can be saved for the nation.’

If no British bidder comes forward the Government will not be able to refuse an export licence.

But Miss Clarkson has indicated she will be willing to sell the piece of jewellery if an offer matching hers is made.

The export licensing decision will be deferred until September 30 and can be delayed until December 30 if proof emerges of a ‘serious’ UK buyer.

Miss Clarkson encountered a similar problem when she bought a first edition of Jane Austen’s novel Persuasion, saying last year: ‘We put in an export request but I can’t take it out of the UK as they’ve named it a national treasure.’

After the author’s death in 1817, aged 41, the ring was given to her older sister Cassandra and kept in the family until it was sold at the auction in London last July.

The Government took the extraordinary step of putting an export bar on a classic £5million Bentley dubbed the 'Concorde of its day' to stop it leaving the country.

This 1929 four litre supercharged Bentley ‘Blower’ is regarded as one of the most significant cars in British motorsport history.

Its current owner forked out a world record £5,042,000 for the motor car at Bonhams’ Goodwood Festival of Speed auction last year.

He has now decided to permanently export the single-seater car.

However, because the Bentley has been recognised as a 'national treasure' by authorities culture secretary Ed Vaizey has temporarily banned its export in the hope of finding a buyer.

Any interested parties would need to spend an agreed price of £5,149,800 for the car, which was raced by motorsport icon Sir Henry ‘Tim’ Birkin.

Birkin, a former fighter pilot, was one of the most famous of the Bentley Boys - a group of wealthy men who raced the British sports cars in the 1920s and 30s.

In March 1932 Birkin set an Outer Circuit record at Brooklands of 137.96mph in the Bentley.

His life was cut short in 1933 in a freak accident after he burned himself on an exhaust pipe during a race.

The burn became infected and he died from septicaemia at the age of 36.

His iconic Bentley was later bought by the horologist George Daniels, who owned it until his death in 2011.

Culture Minister Ed Vaizey yesterday made the decision to defer granting an export licence following a recommendation by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest.

It was agreed with Arts Council England that the Bentley 'was of outstanding significance for the study of motor racing and automobile technology in the first half of the twentieth century'.

The decision on the export licence application for the car will be deferred for a period ending on October 31, 2013. 

This period may be extended until May 31, 2014 inclusive if a serious intention to raise funds to purchase the car is made at the recommended price.
