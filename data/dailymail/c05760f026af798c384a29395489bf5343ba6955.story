A gay couple claim they were thrown out of a pub after they shared a kiss and were branded 'revolting' by the landlord.

Dylan Morris was celebrating his birthday with family and his boyfriend Darren Barnett at the St Levan Inn in Plymouth in Devon when they kissed. 

The couple, both law students, were then told they would have to leave the premises if they continued because the landlord said he did not like 'that sort of behaviour.'

But the landlord of the pub said he would take the same action against a female and male couple for kissing like that on his premises.

Mr Barnett, 22, said: 'The landlord said what we did was revolting.

'All of Dylan's family were there and they were really angry. It was a very stressful situation.

'We are not happy at all with it. This is the first time something like this has happened to me - what we were doing should have been fine. All we did was share a kiss.'

He said they had contacted Plymouth City Council to complain about the incident and would not be returning to the pub. 

Mr Barnett added: 'We were really taken aback by the kind of language he was using. I said it

The landlord of the St Levan Inn said asking the couple to leave had nothing to do with their sexuality 

was discriminatory and against the law, but he shouted to the barman to not serve us.'

'Even the barman looked quite shocked. When we went elsewhere it was fine.' 

His partner Mr Morris, 20, posted a message on Twitter after the incident, which saw several people condemning the heavy handed reaction of the pub. 

'Cannot believe that I was kicked out of my family pub for kissing my boyfriend. Absolutely disgraceful,' he wrote.

However landlord of the Levan Inn, Paul Bodenham, denied that the incident had anything to do with the couple's sexual orientation and said he would do exactly the same if it happened again. 

He said: 'I have been a landlord for 30 years and have never seen behaviour like it.

'There was a complaint from one of my customers. So I said to them, 'if you want to do that again, do it outside.'

'But I did not throw them out. I just told them to go outside if they wanted to act in that manner. Then they started causing all kinds of problems.

'It would be the same if it was a man and a woman kissing like that. I have nothing against gay people - half of my darts team here are lesbians.

'I don't do social media so I haven't seen what people are saying. But I would definitely do the same again.

'Behaviour like that in a pub is unacceptable. It was out of order. I am trying to run a public house and I can't have things like that going on.'
