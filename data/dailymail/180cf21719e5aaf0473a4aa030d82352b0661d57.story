In a drive to find homes for pets in its care, the RSPCA has launched a campaign pairing its animals up with some unlikely companions - characters from the television series Game of Thrones.

Officials at the animal charity have taken shots of some of their lonely pets who they say are doppelgangers for stars of the hit television show and not just when it comes to their looks.

They say a whole host of homeless pets, including dogs, horses and even pigs look like and are similar in nature to Game of Thrones characters.

Three-year-old Barry, a green-eyed bull mastiff has been paired with character The Hound played by Rory McCann

12-year-old Sheba the cat, found herself matched with the 'Mother of Dragons' ,actress Emilia Clarke, thanks to her beautiful blonde locks

Three-year-old Barry, a bull mastiff, is one of the animal look-a-likes, who has been paired with character Sandor Clegane, also known as The Hound, played by Rory McCann.

The Hound is also a bodyguard for King Robert in the series and is known for his brutal, but also compassionate character.

Similarly 12-year-old Sheba the cat, found herself matched with Daenerys Targaryen, known as the 'Mother of Dragons' played by Emilia Clarke - thanks to her beautiful blonde locks.

Two-year-old cocker spaniel Buster was paired with character Jon Snow because of his personality. Buster is described as 'dogged' and  'loyal' and has 'puppy-dog eyes to die for'.

Jon Snow is played by actor Kit Harington and known for his fighting skills and moral character.

Milo, the two-year-old pig, is said to be the twin of King Robert, as the pair are 'sociable, outgoing and can have voracious appetites'.

A spokesman for the RSPCA said it is hoped the latest campaign will see many of their pets rehomed. 

The spokesman said: 'They may not have
 much in common on paper but the characters of the hit TV show Game of 
Thrones have some unlikely animal doppelgangers.

'Like
 the diverse cast of GOT, the RSPCA wants to showcase its wide variety 
of animals up for rehoming - from dogs and cats to pigs and horses.

'Whether
 you are from House Stark, Lannister or a wanna-be 'Mother of Dragons' 
all these Game of Thrones animals are looking for homes and loving 
owners to take them in.'

Clipper, the horse who was made homeless as a result of the floods, was paired up with Khal Drogo who leads a nomadic life as a powerful Horse-Lord

Beatrix, the cat who is homeless at 16, has been paired with Game of Thrones character Joffrey - but carers insist they are not alike in nature

The latest figures released by the charity show it takes an average of 42 days for a dog to find a new home, higher than ever before.

Clipper the horse, one of the latest to find themselves homeless, as a result of the floods, was paired up with Khal Drogo who leads a nomadic life as a powerful Horse-Lord.

Beatrix, 16, found herself unfortunately paired with teenage Joffrey, the current ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, known by many as a 'vicious idiot'.

Carers were quick to add that the cat did not share Joffrey's unfortunate personality and was merely a sweet-natured look-a-like.

The much anticipated fourth season of HBO's Game of Thrones launches on Sunday in the U.S. and hits UK screens the following day.
