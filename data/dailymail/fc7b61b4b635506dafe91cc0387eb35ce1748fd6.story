Authorities confirmed on Sunday that a body found in the Des Moines River was that of a 15-year-old Iowa girl who was abducted along with a younger friend after getting off a school bus last month.An autopsy confirmed the body found Friday night under a bridge near Boone is Kathlynn Shepard's. Her kidnapping on May 20 in the small city of Dayton led to a massive search involving federal, state and local authorities.Chief State Medical Examiner Dr Julia Goodin said Sunday that Kathlynn's death was a homicide and that she died of 'multiple sharp and blunt force injuries.' The autopsy was completed a day earlier.

Residents of Dayton, about 60 miles north of Des Moines, had braced for the news. Investigators had expressed confidence the body - concealed by debris when discovered by a fisherman - was Kathlynn's.

Clothing on the body matched what the high school freshman was wearing when a man lured her and a 12-year-old friend into a pickup truck.

Authorities also found zip ties matching ones used to restrain the younger girl, who managed to escape and call 911.

'Today our family has lost part of its soul - not just the Shepard family but the families of Dayton and all of Iowa,' the Shepards said in a statement.

Offender: Authorities say registered sex offender Michael Klunder kidnapped Kathlynn Shepard and her friend before murdering Kathlynn then killing himself four hours later

'An innocent, caring, fun-loving child was taken from this world long before her time.'

Authorities said 
Kathlynn and her friend were lured into a pickup that police believe was
driven by registered sex offender Michael Klunder.

They said Klunder 
took the girls to a hog confinement facility where he worked, and the 
12-year-old girl was able to get away.

Klunder, 42, was found dead hours later at another rural property. Authorities said he hanged himself.

Gerard Meyers, assistant director of field operators for the Iowa 
Division of Criminal Investigation, said Sunday that authorities believe
Klunder acted alone.

'We have no indications of any co-conspirators,' he said.

Meyers has said a positive identification would be 'the final trigger 
for not only the family but the community, our investigative personnel, 
our partner agencies ... to move into that next phase, which is really 
the closure phase of this very unfortunate circumstance.'

Hundreds of officers and volunteers had searched for Kathlynn, but hopes
of finding her alive were dampened when testing confirmed that blood 
found on Klunder's truck and at the hog building was Kathlynn's.

'We were robbed of some innocence in this whole thing,' said Webster County Sheriff James Stubbs after the body was discovered.

'We'll never quite 
be the same. Hopefully time will heal some of those wounds, but the 
awareness is a lot higher than it was before.'

Klunder had been released from prison in 2011 after serving 20 years for
convictions in two separate Iowa kidnappings that occurred on 
back-to-back days in December 1991.

Police also are investigating whether Klunder is responsible for 
kidnapping and slaying two young cousins who vanished while riding bikes
in Evansdale, about 90 miles from Dayton. The bodies of the girls, who 
were ages 10 and 8 when they vanished, were found in December in a 
wooded area in Bremer County, where Klunder once lived in a home for 
emotionally troubled youth.

Iowa Department of 
Natural Resources had been searching the Des Moines river in boats, said
Bill Kietzman, an Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation special 
agent.

On Tuesday, it was revealed Klunder had taken his own life amidst the massive
search for Kathlynn.

Kietzman said on Tuesday that the body
of the 42-year-old suspect was found with a red Toyota
Tundra pickup at a rural property northeast of Dayton.

The 12-year-old girl told
investigators she and Kathlynn were taken to an agricultural facility. But she
was able to escape a short time later and ran to a rural residence for help,
Kietzman said. She was then taken to a Fort Dodge hospital and released.

The abduction spanned several hours, officials said, with
Klunder's body being discovered nearly four hours after the girls were taken.

Klunder is listed on the state's sex offender registry,
prison records show.

He spent several years in prison after being convicted on
kidnapping and assault charges, including the 1991 abduction and assault of a
Rudd woman and the kidnapping of two toddlers from an apartment complex in
Charles City, according to the Mason City Globe Gazette. The girls, both 3,
were found alive inside a dumpster.

He was released from a work release program in February
2011.
