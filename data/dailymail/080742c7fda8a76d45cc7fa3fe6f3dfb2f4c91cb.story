Chelsea secured qualification for the knockout stages of the Champions League with an emphatic 5-0 win away at Schalke.

John Terry, Willian and a Jan Kirchhoff own goal put the Blues' 3-0 ahead at half-time before second-half substitutes Didier Drogba and Ramires completed the scoreline.

The victory in Gelsenkirchen also means Jose Mourinho's side finish as Group G winners.

Sportsmail's Ashley Clements rates the players' performances in Germany on Tuesday night.

CHELSEA (4-2-3-1)

Thibaut Courtois - 7 

Had another easy night behind Chelsea's rock-solid defence. The Belgian was equal to everything that Schalke threw at him - which wasn't much.

Branislav Ivanovic - 7 

Inches away from scoring with a stunning second half volley. Had little to do at the other end.

Gary Cahill - 7

The England vice-captain won't have many easier nights than this one. Cleared his lines well at the sign of danger.

John Terry - 8 

Set his side on their way with a trademark header early on. The Chelsea defence were rarely tested, but you get the feeling Terry would have been up to a much sterner test.

Cesar Azpilicueta - 7 

Solid as ever. Wingers must dread coming up against the tireless Spaniard. He doesn't give anyone a second on the ball.

Nemanja Matic - 7

The perfect foil to the skill and prowess of Fabregas. Broke up play brilliantly and gave Chelsea a platform to attack freely.

Cesc Fabregas - 8.5 - STAR MAN

The Spanish midfielder just gets better and better. Picked up yet another assist for the opening goal and dictated play throughout.

Willian - 8.5

Put the Blues into a commanding 2-0 lead with a powerful first half strike. The diminutive Brazilian was a bundle of energy and finally found his end product in Gelsenkirchen.

Oscar - 7.5 

Continued his superb run of form with another dominant performance in Germany. Recieved a deserved pat on the back from Mourinho following his substitution.

Eden Hazard - 7.5 

One of the Belgian's more subdued games, but his will to drive towards the byline and and beat a man keeps defenders busy.

Diego Costa - 7 

Will have been frustrated not to score on a night in which Chelsea were so dominant. Having said that, Costa was a constant threat and if he wasn't making space for himself, he was doing so for his team-mates.

Subs

Didier Drogba (66' on for Costa) - 7.5

The man who won Chelsea the Champions League in 2012 was in amongst the action once again. Tapped home to put Chelsea four goals to the good and made sure to celebrate with the Chelsea bench.

Ramires (75' on for Oscar) - 7 

Made a brief second half cameo, but 15 minutes was enough for the Brazilian to head Chelsea into a 5-0 lead.

Schurrle (77' on for Fabregas) - 6

Didn't get much time to impress as Mourinho's side slowed things down for the final 10 minutes.

SCHALKE (4-2-3-1)

Fahrmann - 5, Neustadter - 5, Santana - 4, Howedes - 5, Uchida - 6, Fuchs - 6, Kirchhoff - 4 (Clemens - 45'- 6), Boateng - 6 (Meyer 63 - 5), Hoger - 7, Choupo-Moting - 6, Huntelaar - 6.
