He is America’s weapon of mass distraction, capable of overpowering sporting rivals through thunderous scoring streaks and sheer force of will. The problem for Tom Watson is that Patrick Reed may be as liable to blow up in the silo as hit an opposition target here at Gleneagles.

A shining example of both the strengths and weaknesses of American golf, his trash-talking individual style making him a ferocious competitor but perhaps not the greatest team player, the Ryder Cup rookie’s already-notorious sense of self has prompted some to ask whether anyone in this US team will actually want to partner Reed.

If that sounds harsh, consider that Reed’s team-mates at Augusta State once reportedly held a vote among themselves – and decided that possibly the most talented player any of them had ever seen should be removed from the squad.

Patrick Reed has the talent to beat anyone at the Ryder Cup, but could also implode for the US

Now, the 24-year-old has obviously matured from the kid who had to change schools in order to become the driving force behind Augusta’s remarkable back-to-back NCAA titles.

Yet there is a suspicion that the unruly – unmanageable? – streak is still in there, constantly battling with the unmistakeably terrifying talent we’ll see in action this week.

Recalling his move to Augusta, his then-coach Josh Gregory remembers speaking to Reed’s head of programme at Georgia, Chris Haack. ‘He told me: “You’re going to have your hands full. Patrick can really play - but he needs constant monitoring”,’ revealed Gregory, who later suspended Reed for two unspecified violations of team rules in 2009. ‘Patrick already thought he was twice as good as he really was.’

Former Augusta State team-mate Henrik Norlander added: ‘He shot his mouth off early when he shouldn’t have.’

Fortunately for Reed, it transpired that he had the game to back up the talk.

The 24-year-old, however, says the Ryder Cup is completely different and that he's ready to be a team player

One college acquaintance recalls bombing a drive 275 yards down the middle of a fairway, celebrating appropriately, then watching in astonishment as Reed got down on his knees – and, from that kneeling position, hit one 10 yards further.

On best behaviour on Thursday, the man who raised so many hackles by describing himself as ‘top five-player in the world’ earlier this year refuted accusations that he’s not a team player, the world No 27 insisting: ‘Did it upset me? No, I let a lot of things go and brush it off my shoulder.

‘Golf is an individual sport. I go to the golf course on a normal basis, I get out there in the morning, I pop in my headphones just to kind of get myself focused on to what I’m trying to do while I’m out there.

‘This week is completely different. This week, we have had so much fun with all the guys. Just a lot of activities we’ve been doing and all that kind of stuff.

‘When you play a normal PGA TOUR event, it’s a lonely sport, but here it’s totally different and I feel like the camaraderie that we have as a team is very high. I feel like the excitement and just the fun aspect that we’ve had, it’s been amazing.’

Intriguingly, Reed names Ian Poulter as one of the three players he’d pick to make up his dream fourball, explaining that he’d had an enormous amount of fun playing with him on the Tour.

‘He made you laugh literally the entire 18 holes we played, it was always just one-liners and jabbing a little bit,’ he explained.

‘He was a lot of fun, real down-to-earth and easy to play with. I felt like if I spent some more time with him, (I would) get a couple more laughs and play some good golf.’

Asked the obvious question about whether facing off against Team Europe talisman Poulter would be quite as light-hearted this week, Reed deadpanned: ‘No. Angry Bird.’

It shouldn’t be a surprise that he likes the brash Englishman, though. Poulter is a guy who works best when he makes a borderline outrageous statement – and then forces himself to back it up.

Reed, who built up a remarkable unbeaten record in college matchplay, certainly enjoys this format, saying he’d feel confident of promising captain Tom Watson a point any time he went on course.

‘I think every guy on our team would,’ he said. ‘All of us are confident, all of us feel like we’re playing really well.

‘I’ve absolutely loved watching the Ryder Cup since I was a little kid. My father used to play golf, so it didn’t matter whether it was played in the States or played over here, it was on the TV.

‘Whether I was up at two or three in the morning, we were always watching it. It was one of those things that I’ve always dreamed of making the team, and finally making the team means a lot. Hopefully we can do our job and hopefully the Cup comes back home.

‘I was 6-0 in matchplay throughout my career. I played a lot of things in college because, at Augusta State, half the team was international and half the team was US — so we played multiple times a year in a Ryder Cup kind of a format and events like that. Those are just the kind of things I feel like are going to help me this week.

‘I love being the underdog and kind of the team that’s not really expected to win. I mean, Augusta State, did you expect us to win two in a row? We still did it.’

Reed’s take on captain Watson is simple and honest enough, the rookie saying of the living legend: ‘He gets it.’ As for advice the great man has passed on, the three-time Tour winner revealed: ‘He just said be yourself, play your own game.’

The second part of that may be enough to beat anything Europe have to offer, up to and including Rory McIlroy. In a contest where par-fives are often crucial, Reed’s power and accuracy — stats fan Paul McGinley should look away from his numbers on approaches from 200 yards-plus — could be the decisive factor.

As for whether he’ll work and play well with the others in red, white and blue? If he’s winning points for the team, that’ll be a lot easier. He certainly won’t be hiding in the corner of the team room, whatever happens out on the course.

‘Patrick Reed’s never been the type of player who’s going to go anywhere quietly,’ said one former team-mate. It is certainly likely that this noisy Texan will do some damage here. To whom, exactly, remains to be seen.
