A man, 56, got fired last summer as head of security for the U.S. Open after a string of racist emails calling black people stupid surfaced. Despite the scandal, he's landed himself a new job working as head of security for a music festival in Woodstock, NY this weekend.

Scott Dennison of Scottsdale, Arizona told his staff not to hire any African Americans to work security at the U.S. Open and wrote them an email saying, 'No African-Americans please — only limited quantities that have brains and can actually do a day’s work.'

He also wrote an email on July 22, 2010 in which he made a mock testimony from a black employee named Sean Felder, 45, of Harlem responding to a job posting.

'Yu sez brothurz, Mr. Gon allows the black man to be superior we run the place cuz we needs the money and Obama and Rev Sharpton allowed us to mix with the White Crackers at this event,' he wrote.

'Come on down we can cheat, steal, eat food and sleep. Just like our new govt allows us to do, to get back at the white man for Slavery,' the testimony stated.

The New York Post reports that Dennison even spoke of training security dogs with 'n—er-eating exercises.'

Despite his controversial history, Dennison was named manager of 'risk and crowd services; at the Mysteryland Festival in Bethel Woods where the famed Woodstock Concert was held in 1969.

'We were aware of these allegations and investigated them thoroughly,' said SFX spokesman Ritty Van Straalen responsible for the Mysteryland Festival.

'We also received some very strong and convincing recommendations from several people who know Scott well, both personally and professionally, and they ­assured us that the alleged statements do not reflect his true character,' said Ritty van Straalen.

The Post reports that van Straalen sent them a letter from one of Dennison's black friends who claimed to be a former Secret Service agent working for the Department of Homeland Security.

Another source told the New York Post that a different security firm also hired to manage the festival were angered by his hiring and demanded a contract to prohibit him from interacting with their workers.
