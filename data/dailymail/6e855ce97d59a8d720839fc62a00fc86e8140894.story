May the Force build with you Obi Wan Lego-bi! These pictures show characters from the Star Wars movies being unveiled - in Lego.

The 250,000-brick display took weeks to piece together and depicts Star Wars Episode II, The Attack of the Clones, which starred Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman.

Characters Obi Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala are shown.

And the set up includes scenes showing the start of the Clone Wars, the droid factory, the Geonosian Arena of Justice and Kamino's clone factory as well as the scene depicting Obi Wan's duel with Jango Fett.

The display has been unveiled to the public for the first time at the Legoland Discovery Centre near Manchester which opened in the Trafford Centre back in 2010.
