Saturday Night Live planned to air a sketch about the Ferguson, Missouri protests this weekend, but cut the controversial sketch because the show was short on time.

NBC has now released the dress-rehearsal version of the sketch online, which follows morning show hosts in St Louis trying to remain cheery about a night of violent demonstrations for police shooting victim Michael Brown.

Instead, the show tackled the national protests over police brutality on Weekend Update and with a  a sketch about Al Sharpton's reaction to a Staten Island grand jury's decision not to indict the NYPD officer who killed Eric Garner.

Awkward: The sketch featured Cecily Strong and Kenan Thompson as co-hosts of a St Louis morning show, struggling to remain cheery in the wake of the Michael Brown protests 

Unfortunate: James Frano appears as a chef promoting a cookbook, with the unfortunate name of Darrel Wilson 

In the five-minute sketch, castmembers Cecily Strong and Kenan Thompson play Jenny and Kip, the co-hosts of St Louis morning show 'Rise and Smile',  who feel uncomfortable keeping up with their typically silly banter and feel-good segments in light of the unrest. 

James Franco, who hosted the December 7 episode, appears as a chef promoting his new cookbook who has the unfortunate name of Darrel Wilson - just a letter difference to Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot dead Brown. 

Appearing to give updates on the traffic is new castmember Leslie Jones, who eventually abandons the show and flies her helicopter out of St Louis.

'Is that the Chicago skyline?' Cecily ask. 

'Hell yes, and I am NOT coming back,' Jones replies.

The clip finishes with Cecily deciding to end  'Rise and Smile' 53 minutes early, when a visiting quartet starts singing Billy's Joel's hit 'We didn't start the fire'. More than a dozen Ferguson businesses were torched in the Brown protests.

Before each live televised show, SNL hosts a dress rehearsal where they run through all of the sketches in contention, and cut segments for time or that don't register enough laughs with the studio audience. 

It's unclear why the SNL producers ultimately decided to nix the sketch, though they were clearly proud enough to release it online in it's unpolished version.

Race has been a tricky subject for SNL in the past, and just last season was criticized for the lack of diversity among the cast.

That led show creator Lorne Michaels to start a nationwide search for a black female cast member, which ultimately ended in the mid-season hiring of Sasheer Zamata. Four of the 15 current repertory and featured castmembers are African American with this season's addition of Jones.
