Looking for shrimps in rock-pools, devouring sausage rolls behind a colourful wind-breaker, stubborning out the weather until the rain arrives - it is hard not to get nostalgic for the British beach holidays of our youths.

And it seems the majority of Britons feel that way as a TripAdvisor survey reveals 82 per cent of Brits name the seaside in the UK as their favourite childhood memory.

More than a third (36 per cent) of Brits have returned to their preferred childhood break spot in the past five years, the study of 5,000 UK travellers found.

We DO like to be beside the seaside: 82% of Brits name a trip to the coast as their favourite holiday

And the good news for the UK tourism industry is that more than half of Brits (57 per cent) named their favourite childhood holiday as a trip to the British seaside.

The survey uncovered that, for most of us, childhood memories are associated with seaside sensations - the swooshing crash of the sea (37 per cent) and the sludge of wet sand between our toes (19 per cent) being the two most cited sensations.

An overwhelming 82 per cent of Brits named a destination in the UK as their childhood treasure, with South West England holding the fondest holiday memories for a third (30 per cent), followed by the South East (14 per cent) and Wales (14 per cent).

Boon for British Tourism!  82% of Brits surveyed named a UK destination as their treasured childhood holiday

James Kay, TripAdvisor spokesman, said: 'For many of us, our favourite memories as a child are often from when we were on holiday, so perhaps it is no surprise that so many of us relive those holidays again as adults.

'But what is interesting is that when we do return we often find new things to fall in love with, which proves that it is worth taking the time to research new places to stay, eat and visit even if we're travelling somewhere familiar.'

Nearly 90 per cent of Brits who have revisited their preferred childhood haunts in the last five years have not been disappointed; most wanted to share their childhood holiday spot with their partner and found it lived up to expectations.

46% of parents have taken their children to their own favourite holiday destination in the last five years

 Among parents, nearly half (46 per cent) have revisited their favourite childhood holiday destination with their own children.

Three quarters (75 per cent) of parents said their children enjoyed the familiar trip as much as they had done as a child, though interestingly over a third (37 per cent) said that the reasons for this had been different; everything changes.

Some 54 per cent of parents say they feel family holidays are safer now than they were when they were a child, and nearly three quarters (74 per cent) feel there are more activities for the whole family to do than when they were young.

So if you've been hankering after the bucket and spade holiday of your younger years, now is the time; slip into the sea of your memories with your children or partner, with the added bonus of  online information  to help you plan the perfect trip and no life-sapping airport queues or delays.
