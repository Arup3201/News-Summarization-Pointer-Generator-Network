People so desperate to join an 'elite' dating site catering to 'beautiful people' are undergoing extreme makeovers to make the cut. 

To join BeautifulPeople.com, there is a 48-hour voting period where members of the opposite sex decide whether they are attractive enough to join. 

Since its launch in 2003, the site has rejected 7.5 million applicants. However, more than one in four refused to accept defeat and  made dramatic changes to their appearance in the hope of being accepted.

Transformation: Kelly O'Donnell (pictured, left, after, and right, before) from Canada is just one of the people undergoing extreme makeovers to be 'beautiful' enough to join an elite dating website

The site has rejected 7.5 million applicants. More than one in four, like Kelly, pictured, refuse to accept defeat

A nutritional consultant from Canada, an administration student from Poland and a British PA all feature in a selection of beautiful singles who show that sheer determination, dramatic make-overs, styling, hours in the gym and, in some cases, cosmetic surgery can transform their appearance.

Speaking about her transformation, Kelly O’Donnell, a nutrional consultant from Canada, said: 'After reaching 200lbs I knew my life had to change. I was tired of feeling run down and sick all the time. So I decided to learn all I could about nutrition and began to exercise. Eight years later, two half marathons, and 90lbs slimmer, I truly have left that life behind. I love the results.'

Aleksandra Pieczek, an administration student from Poland, said her transformation has changed her life. She said: 'I didn't want to be nobody, so I started to change my life - I changed my diet, my lifestyle, I started to be active, following a Mel B fitness programme, using my bike, swimming, zumba etc. 

'After one year I lost about 8 kg, my hair is now so long and healthy, I met someone new who helped me to change - I started studying, I became a cheerleader and photomodel'.

One male user, Alexander Siegwardt, a German student, said of the site: 'I was rejected by BeautifulPeople.com so many times, so I decided to change my life to boost my confidence. I worked out 7 times a week for 9 months now and I simply enjoy my transformation as much the attention and interest from others that I get.' 

Greg Hodge, managing director of BeautifulPeople.com, said: 'Because there are no limits to the number of times a rejected applicant can attempt to re-apply, it is not unusual for us to see three, four or sometimes more than 20 attempts to get through our very stringent voting-in process.

Tweaks: The site's managing director says that sometimes it's just down to straightening your teeth, curbing your appetite, grooming yourself with a little more care and getting down to the gym. Aleksandra Piecze, pictured before her makeover, did just that

'Take a look at some of the best looking celebrities in Hollywood and it's clear to see they weren't born beautiful.

'Demi Moore, Nicole Kidman and Ryan Seacrest are all great examples and an inspiration to unattractive people the world over so if they can do it, then so can you.

'Sometimes it's just down to straightening your teeth, curbing your appetite, grooming yourself with a little more care and getting down to the gym.

'We've also recently launched a mentoring service, pairing some of our most successful members who are also professional beauty experts, stylists and confidence coaches with beautiful hopefuls who don't know how to improve their looks.

'This has definitely contributed to a rise in second time success stories this year alone.

'Many people write us off as a heartless, lookist dating community that exists to alienate the aesthetically disadvantaged. But that's not true. We want to encourage people to make the best of themselves.

'We get more excited about successful transformation stories than any other application and our members who transform themselves tell us how our rejection letter was the best thing that could have ever happened to them - and that we've positively enhanced their lives.'

A British user, who wishes to remain anonymous, said: 'Like most students I piled the weight on at University.

'I have always, always hated my big hooked nose. I lost some weight after uni and finally had the courage to take the plunge and get a nose job in June 2014.

'It hasn't been easy - my brother hasn't spoken to me since I had the rhinoplasty - but I've never felt better.'

The most beautiful country is currently Sweden and plunging to the ugliest country in the world with the lowest acceptance rate is the UK.

Mr Hodge added: 'It pains me because I'm British, but our combined lack of effort with profile pictures, our pub culture, lack of grooming and lack of active lifestyles, are seeing us plummet to the bottom of the pile.

'Applying with a selfie, pint in hand just won't do. If you keep getting rejected, there are other sites for you - or you need to re-think your look.'

BeautifulPeople has more than 800,000 members worldwide.
