If it’s any consolation to Roy Hodgson, the man he will face in the suffocating heat of Manaus a week on Saturday touched down in Brazil in the early hours on Friday with enough problems of his own.

Cesare Prandelli’s Italy have not won in seven games since beating the Czech Republic in Turin in September. Even for a country renowned for coming to the boil slowly before major tournaments, it is a worrying scenario.

‘Italian Mystery’ was the main headline in the Corriere della Sera after Wednesday’s shock 1-1 draw with Luxembourg, ranked 112th in the world.

Down but not out: Mario Balotelli falls to the floor during Italy's draw with Luxembourg

‘Same Italy before the World Cup, one goal and a draw even against Luxembourg’ declared La Repubblica.

‘Where will victory come from?’ was the simple question on the front page of La Gazzetta dello Sport with a picture of Mario Balotelli with his eyes squeezed shut.

A more pertinent question might be: where will the goals from?

Plenty to think about: Cesare Prandelli's side have not won in seven games, leaving Balotelli frustrated

Much depends on Balotelli but the Italians know enough about their combustible striker to realise that is dangerous, not least because rumours persist that the former Manchester City man is struggling with a groin problem.

Hodgson is certainly not the only one wrestling with issues over his strikers.

Prandelli’s decision to omit Giuseppe Rossi from his squad and include Lorenzo Insigne has sparked a national debate. Of his others front men, Ciro Immobile is considered too inexperienced and Antonio Cassano unpredictable.

Midfield, arguably Italy’s strongest area, has been hit by the broken leg suffered by Riccardo Montolivo. Prandelli has been forced to ditch his 4-3-1-2 formation — with Montolivo sat behind the front two — and go back to the drawing board.

On Wednesday, he tried  4-1-4-1 for the first time but it clearly did not work, with Italy’s midfield failing to get forward to provide enough support for Balotelli.

Italy have been here before, underachieving before a World Cup only to find their form at the right time. But the pain of an early exit in South Africa four years ago is too fresh for their fans to take anything for granted.
