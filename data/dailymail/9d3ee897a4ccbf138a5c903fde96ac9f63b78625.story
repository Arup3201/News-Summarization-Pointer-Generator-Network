For years, Nicole Hulbig collected beloved pets and rescue dogs from all over the country and promised to train them to be therapy dogs for PTSD-stricken soldiers and disabled children. 

Her pledges turned to ash this week after authorities found 37 bags of badly-decomposed dead dogs in her barn near Clarksville, Tennessee, along with 39 canines that were barely alive - covered in their own filth, locked in a cages that were too small and deprived of food and water.

The horrific discovery on Thursday follows animal control officers removing four rotting dead puppies locked in cages from another home she lived in.

Hulbig, 29, has been arrested on 12 counts of animal cruelty and outraged dog owners are demanding she face even tougher penalties.

Shocking: Nicole Hulbig, 29, has been charged with 12 counts of animal cruelty for the dogs found at home homes in Tennessee

Before and after: One owner who left her dog Max in Hulbig's care said he dropped from 90lbs (left) to 55lbs (right) since February

This is Max shortly after he was returned to owner Leah Patterson. Patterson says he is recovering after his horrific ordeal

The Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle reports that Hulbig ran RRR Service Dogs, which claimed to be a non-profit organization that rescued unwanted dogs and trained them to be service animals.

Among the dogs that she took her were three dogs brought to the U.S. from Afghanistan by a California attorney and a German Sheppard owned by a disabled veteran.

Their owners say Hulbig promised to retrain them and make them less aggressive. Now, the dogs are believed dead - among the countless dozens piled into bags and left to decay in her barn.

'I think they’re dead,' California lawyer Amy Konstantelos told the Leaf-Chronicle, speaking about the three dogs she had rescued from Afghanistan.

'I think they’re in one of those bags, and we’ll never know which one.'

Hubig's husband, Eric Hubig, was also charged with animal cruelty for the four dead puppies found at a home he had rented with his wife

Hubig did provide proof that she had trained some dogs at her orgnaization. She posted this picture on her now-defunct Facebook page

Hulbig told authorities that the dogs died after a wave of distemper, a virulent canine virus, struck the kennels.

Since authorities have no proof that the animal died from neglect or cruelty, she cannot be charged for any of their deaths.

However, Hulbig and her husband Eric Hulbig can be charged for four dead puppies that were discovered in a former home. Authorities say they were locked in cages and left to die without food or water when the couple abandoned the home.

Despite the tragedy, there is some good news. Some of the surviving dogs have been reunited with their owners who turned them over to Hulbig.

One of those is Leah Patterson, who left Max in Hulbig's care in February after she promised to give him better training. She found him on Thursday among the surviving dogs that were seized from her barn.

'They bring him out, and I literally hit my knees crying,' he told the Leaf-Chronicle.

'I didn’t believe it was him. He was 89.6 pounds, and now he’s 55 pounds. Another week or two and the vet said he would have been dead.'

Police cannot claim they died from neglect, so Hubig will not be charged in relation to the dog remains
