Three inmates being held in the same cell of a jail in rural Alabama broke out of the facility early this morning after attacking the guard on duty, sparking a massive police manhunt that is yet to turn up any leads.

The trio - Demarcus Woodward, 23, Justin Terrell Gordon, 23, and Gemayel Culbert, 32 - coerced the jailer into their cell at Choctaw County Jail around 2am Saturday.

One of the men screamed for the guard saying his cellmate was sick, and when the guard looked through a porthole he saw another inmate apparently vomiting.

However once entering the cell, the jailer was jumped by all three, who stole his phone and keys, according to USA Today.

Escapees: (L-R) Demarcus Woodward, 23, Gemayel Culbert, 32, and Justin Terrell Gordon, 23 - coerced a rural Alabama prison guard into coming into their cell before attacking him and fleeing, police say

One of the men - reportedly Gordon - immediately fled on foot.

The other two allegedly wrapped the guard's head in a towel and sprayed it with Lysol, according to ABC News.

The jailer was left unconscious from the attack and could only report the incident once he woke up.

The men - who have been charged with unrelated crimes and are not believed to have known each other sharing the cell - ran one-quarter mile down a state highway before being picked up by a car, police dogs detected.

Over 100 law enforcement officials are now searching for the trio. 

As of 4.30 pm Saturday, there were no leads, USA Today reported.

Demarcus Woodward, 23, allegedly shot and killed a prison inmate who was out on work-release.

Gemayel Culbert, 32, was allegedly involved in the murder of two people at a private club.

The third escapee, Justin Terrell Gordon, 23, was being held on charges of armed robbery following a convenience store theft.

All three are considered dangerous.

'We have no updates,' Choctaw County Sheriff Tom Abate told the newspaper.

'We cannot release any information except that we're looking for them, (and) they're dangerous individuals.

'We're telling people if they see them, contact your local law enforcement agency.'
