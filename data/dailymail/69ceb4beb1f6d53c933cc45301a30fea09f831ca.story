A woman driver had a miraculous escape after a lorry overturned and shed 40 tonnes of crushed cars on to the roof of her Vauxhall Corsa.Â 

The unnamed 63-year-old was left trapped inside her car underneath a pile of scrap metal after the lorry overturned while going around a roundabout in Bromley, Kent.

Firefighters could only free her by cutting her out of her Corsa but incredibly they found the female driver unharmed with only minor scratches.

A Bromley police spokesman said: 'A 
tipper lorry fully laden with crushed vehicles and other metals turned 
over on to its side while travelling around the roundabout.

'As it did so, the 40 tonne cargo tipped
out on to a Vauxhall Corsa driven by an elderly female waiting at a 
junction.

'It also spilled out on to the path next to the church.

'Somewhat incredibly, the crushed 
vehicles and metal were pulled from the Vauxhall Corsa, and after the 
roof of her vehicle was cut away, she was found with a few scratches and
very much alive.'

The lorry driver and the 63-year-old 
driver of the Vauxhall Corsa were taken to the Princess Royal University
Hospital, in Farnborough Common, Orpington, to be treated for minor 
injuries and shock.

West Wickham High Street was closed eastbound from the 
roundabout following 
the crash at 3.12pm until 5.17pm on Monday.

A London Ambulance spokesperson said: 'We sent two ambulance crews, two single responders in a car and a duty manager.'
