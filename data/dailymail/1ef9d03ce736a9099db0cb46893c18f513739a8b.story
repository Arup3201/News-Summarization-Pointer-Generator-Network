Prosecutors in the trial of an Arizona woman accused of slashing and shooting her ex-boyfriend to death in his shower have shown the jury a graphic picture of his face and body after the attack.

A bloody image of Travis Alexander, a 30-year-old Mormon motivational speaker and insurance salesman, was one of the many found on his water-logged camera in his washing machine after his decomposing body was discovered.

His ex-girlfriend, Jodi Arias, is on trial for stabbing Alexander 27 times, slitting his throat and shooting him in the head at his Mesa, Arizona home in June 2008, months after they broke up.

Despite initially telling police she had
not seen him for months, the camera revealed their sexual encounter on 
the day of his murder, as well as naked images of Alexander in the 
shower moments before he died.

The device even revealed photographs of his bloody body and another showing Arias dragging it across the ground - apparently taken accidentally when the camera was dropped.

The images are just the latest pieces of bizarre evidence in the trial that is already being compared to the dramatic 2010 murder trial of Casey Anthony.

Arias, a photographer who dated 
Alexander for nearly five months in 2007, has pleaded not-guilty to first degree murder. If convicted,
she could become the fourth woman on Arizona's death row.

She originally claimed she had not 
seen Alexander the day of his murder, before claiming she had seen two 
men kill him, before eventually saying that she killed him out of self defense.

At the trial, 
defense attorneys have painted a picture of Alexander as an abusive, 
manipulative boyfriend who made Arias wear a t-shirt reading: 'Travis 
Alexander's'.

Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi asked lead detective Esteban Flores whether Alexander 
referred to his ex-girlfriend in emails as a s*** and a w****, 
to which he detective answered in the affirmative.

Flores also testified that the 
communique included the devout Mormon writing to Arias: 'I think I 
was little more than a dildo with a heartbeat to you.'

On Thursday, jurors heard testimony from Flores and a recording of a conversation he had with Arias in June 2008.

On
the call, Arias denied being involved in the death and calmly told the 
detective that she had not seen Alexander in two months.

Motive: The prosecution claim Arias flew into a jealous rage after learning he wanted to date another woman

Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference

According to Flores, the defendant told 
him during questioning that she and Alexander were so distrustful of 
each other that they shared their Facebook, MySpace and Gmail passwords 
in a failed bid to patch up their unraveling relationship, ABC News reported.

Jennifer Willmott, an attorney for 
Arias, told jurors her client acted in self-defense after Alexander 
'lunged at Jodi in anger' in his suburban Mesa home after she dropped 
his new camera.

'Jodi's
life was in danger. He knocked her to the ground in the bathroom where 
there was a struggle,' Willmott said. 'If she did not have to defend 
herself, she would not be here.'

Yet prosecutors argue Arias was a jealous woman who brutally attacked Alexander after he tried to end their relationship.

'This
is not a case of whodunit,' Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Juan 
Martinez said in his opening statement. 'The person who committed this 
killing sits in court today - Jodi Ann Arias.'

Alexander had told friends Arias had 
become too possessive and was acting like a stalker, so he ended their 
relationship to see other women. But phone and email records indicate 
the pair continued to carry on a sexual relationship, The Arizona 
Republic reported.

Flores downplayed the stalker 
description, saying Alexander was inviting Arias to his home and the 
phone calls between them 'were back and forth.'

According
to court records filed by Arias' attorneys, Alexander persuaded her to 
come to his home on June 4, 2008. They claim the couple had sex, then 
took provocative photographs of each other.

The couple had met at a work 
conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the 
phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 
emails.

They started dating
in 
February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be 
baptized into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias 
telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame.

In December 2007, Alexander 
began dating another girl and allegedly told friends that Arias became so jealous that she 
slashed the tyres on his car twice.

In June 2008, Alexander told friends he thought Arias might have hacked 
into his Facebook account and told her to stay away.

'There's nothing about her that I see in
marriage material - or wife material,' Alexander had said, according to 
his friend, Dave Hall. 'But it's hard to say no to a woman that sneaks 
into your house, crawls in your bed and tries to, you know, seduce you.'

The claims come as RadarOnline revealed a tragic post on Alexander's blog about his fear of dating an 'axe murderer' and his desire to get married.

At first Arias denied being at his 
house the day he was killed, yet police found a camera in 
Alexander's washing machine containing graphic pictures of the pair having sex.

The water-logged camera, which belonged to
Alexander, had been damaged in the washing machine, but the Mesa police crime lab was able to recover images, some of which had been deleted.

Among those deleted were pictures showing Alexander posing naked in the shower at 5.22pm, with the last picture
showing him alive at 5.30pm. Later photos showed him bleeding 
while on the floor.

The camera also contained pictures of Arias posing naked on
Alexander's bed at 1.40pm.

On June 9, his friends went to his upscale home after he had failed to return their calls. They found him dead in his shower and his body was 'well into the decomposition process'.

Wounds show that Alexander attempted 
to fight back, court records show. An autopsy found he sustained 27 puncture 
wounds and one gunshot wound, with the bullet found in his left cheek.

Investigators also found a bloody left palm print with Arias' DNA on the bathroom wall. Her DNA was also found 
in hair recovered from a bloody wall, according to the Arizona Republic.

After
initially claiming that she had not been at his home that day, Arias 
changed her story to admit she had been there - but had not killed her 
ex-boyfriend.

Missed: Alexander, a motivational speaker from Arizona, was found several days after the killing

'I witnessed Travis being attacked by 
two other individuals,' she told Inside Edition. 'Who were they? I 
don't know. I couldn't pick them up in a police lineup.'

She later changed her story once 
again, telling the court that she killed Alexander in self defense after
he became angry when she dropped his camera.

She claims he had been sexually and physically abusive throughout their relationship.

'It makes me sick because I know her 
true side,' Steven Alexander, Travis Alexander's brother, told ABC. 'And I ask people to please not buy into 
this sweet innocent personality that she puts on.'

As well as the inconsistencies in her story, Arias' case has been plagued with difficulties with her legal representation.

She asked to represent herself but 
when she submitted letters to the court that she claimed Alexander had 
written - saying he was a pedophile - they were found to be forgeries, and she told a judge she was in 'over her head'.

Her defense team was reinstated but in December 2011, her attorney, Victoria Washington, was granted a motion to withdraw from the case.

Jennifer Willmott, a death penalty-qualified defense attorney, had now been assigned to represent Arias. In January 2012, a judge denied a motion asking for the death penalty to be rejected.
