A French a surf instructor has claimed he saw a man disappear while surfing 10 foot waves at a break know as 'No Man's Land' in Indonesia about the same time as Australian surfer Peter Maynard was reported missing from his Indonesian hotel.

Peter Maynard, a father-of-three from Noosa on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, was reported missing nearly ten days ago from the Nusa Indah Bungalow on Nusa Lembongan, an island off Bali.

Mr Maynard was last seen ten days ago at his hotel having breakfast at about 9am, August 26.

But now surfing instructor Christopher Capel, who works at the Monkey Surfing school, claims he saw a surfer separate from the pack, making his way to No Man's Land, he told News Corp Australia.

He says he last saw the surfer catch a 10 foot wave before disappearing into the sea. 

At the time he disappeared, the island was experiencing winter huge swells.

Mr Capel said he remembers 15 surfers in the area and predicts the over crowding as the reason for the surfer to separate.

'It was a big set coming and we could see from far away he managed to catch one wave and after the big set was going, he went with the foam.

'Everybody thought he was gone back to shore,' Mr Capel said.

Peter Maynard's wife, Kylie has traveled to Indonesia to join the search for her husband,

'I am doing as well as can be expected,' she said while waiting for a flight to Indonesia.

She said her husband had travelled alone on his surfing trip and last made contact with her two weeks ago.

But she said she didn't have any clue he was missing until she was contacted by consular officials.

The father-of-three was last seen ten days ago at his hotel, in Nusa Indah Bungalow on Nusa Lembongan, having breakfast on August 26 at around 9am.

It was when Mr Maynard failed to check out on August 28 that staff became suspicious and reported him missing to police.

Hotel owner Made Mariata told Daily Mail Australia Mr Maynard checked in to the hotel on August 23 at midday and was meant to stay for five days.

'Checkout was midday on the 28th and we didn't see him but the key was still at reception. We waited for a long time and then had a look at his room - it has all his bags still there, his passport, his wallet, wet suit and camera.'

Mr Mariata said they then reported him missing to police.

Police are mystified on the whereabouts of the Australian tourist, failing to find any trace of Mr Maynard despite searching the area and speaking with locals.

They said all options have been assessed and nothing adds up. 

'Police have helped us look everywhere - checking the harbour, speaking with the boat company, checking to see if he went snorkelling. 

'We searched until late at night and then continued next morning but we didn't find him.

'We are still looking' 

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Daily Mail Australia they are providing consular assistance to the family and friends of the Australian tourist.

'We hope we find him safe, our fingers are crossed,' Mr Mariata said.
