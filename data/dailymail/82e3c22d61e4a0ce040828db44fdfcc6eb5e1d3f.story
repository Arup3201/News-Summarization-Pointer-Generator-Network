Ronaldinho has had his glittering career celebrated with a wall of replica shirts from all the clubs he has represented as well as the Brazil national team.

The legendary forward shared a picture on his Facebook page that shows dedicated fan Giovanny Tocohua posing in front of his collection of 78 shirts, each bearing Ronaldinho's name and number.

The colourful patchwork of 78 strips charts his career from its beginnings at Brazilian club Gremio, through Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona, Milan, Flamengo and, latterly, Atletico Mineiro.
