A woman was dragged from a freezing lake by two police officers today after her car careered into the water in one of London's most exclusive residential areas.

The female driver, 32, is believed to have plunged off a wooden jetty into the Long Pond in Totteridge, north London, just after 8am.

A member of the public spotted the driver unconscious at the wheel of her blue Nissan Micra, which was already submerged halfway under water, and called emergency services.

Submerged: A 32-year-old woman was rescued by two policemen after her Nissan Micra plunged into a freezing lake in Totteridge, North London, this morning

Crash: The woman's car is believed to have plunged off a wooden jetty into the icy cold lake

She was rescued by two officers from 
Barnet Police after they waded into the freezing water and smashing the 
driver's side window with a special police-issue hammer.

The woman was showing signs of hypothermia and was taken to hospital. Her condition is not life-threatening.

The two officers were taken to hospital after 
for a check-up and tetanus shots, but were later discharged and sent 
home to recover for the rest of the day.

Barnet Borough Commander Adrian Usher said: 'I am incredibly proud of these officers and would like to pay tribute to the speed and courage with which they acted to protect the life of this driver.

'In the bitterly cold conditions we have today, there is little doubt that a sustained period in the water would have posed a serious threat to the woman's life.

Rescue operation: Passers-by spotted the woman unconscious behind the wheel of the submerged car and called police. Officers can be seen paddling out to the abandoned vehicle to help retrieve it this afternoon

Dangerous: It is believed the woman may have spent up to 20 minutes in the freezing cold water - which may have caused her to pass out if she was not unconscious already

'This incident demonstrates the lengths 
that officers in Barnet, London, and across the country are willing to 
go to in order to protect members of the communities they serve, and 
they are deserving of our utmost gratitude.'

The circumstances surrounding the incident are still unclear but the woman is thought to have spent around 15 to 20 minutes in the icy waters and may have passed out from the cold.

The smash happened during the morning rush-hour, just off an idyllic road lined with multi-million pound mega-mansions, many of which are owned by premiership footballers.

And today Inspector David Sanders hailed the bravery of the police officers who had rescued the woman - but remained tight-lipped when asked about possible reasons for the plunge.

Brave: Two policemen waded out into the lake to reach the woman trapped in car

Pulling her in: The police officers used a special police-issue hammer to smash the car window and pull the woman out

He said: 'I would not 
like to speculate at this stage.'

'The driver of the car was unconscious. The two calls we had from members of the public said she was unconscious.

'That could have been because of the cold - the two police officers had to smash the window open to pull her out of the car.'

Inspector Sanders also declined to say whether the woman, who is a mother, was known to police.

And Inspector Sanders lavished praise on the officers who had rescued her, saying: 'I am very proud of the two officers and I would like to commend their courage.'

Saved: The driver - a 32-year-old mother - was showing signs of hypothermia and was taken to hospital. Her condition is not life threatening

The two young policemen were taken to hospital for a check-up but were later released and allowed to go home

He said: 'They were young, fit officers who took the decision to enter the water, which was very cold - at around 8am this morning the temperature was just above freezing with the wind-chill factor.

'They are unscathed. They have had a check-up, a shower, change of clothes and are now back home.'

Inspector Sanders, who said he hoped the officers would be back at work tomorrow added: 'Officers obviously have guidelines to go by, and they are warned that their safety is paramount.

'These two took a decision that potentially saved a woman's life.'

At lunchtime today the car was still submerged in around 4ft of frigid water.

Policemen had paddled out to the car, while a recovery truck was parked by the side of the road waiting to tow the wrecked vehicle away.

The Nissan Micra was hauled from the water in Totteridge to be towed away this afternoon - several hours after the crash at 8am
