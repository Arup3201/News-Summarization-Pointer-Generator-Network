Boston University has been left reeling following the release of an explosive report detailing allegations of gross sexual misconduct by the hockey team which comes just a month after a former player pleaded guilty to assaulting a woman. 

Corey Trivino, a second-round draft pick by the New York Islanders who played four seasons at BU and was their top scorer, drunkenly tried to force himself on a woman in her dorm room on campus in 2011, the Boston Globe said.

Rape charges against a second player, Max Nicastro, were filed but later dropped when prosecutors said they could not meet the burden of proof.

Hockey star: Corey Trivino who played four seasons at Boston University pleaded guilty to an assault charge in August for allegedly trying to force himself on a woman

Nicastro signed an entry-level 
contract with the Detroit Red Wings shortly thereafter and has been 
assigned to play for Grand Rapids in the American Hockey League.

On August 7, Trivino, 22, was 
sentenced to two years of probation during which he must be tested 
randomly for alcohol use, attend weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, 
receive a mental health evaluation, and have no contact with the victim.

Harrowing night: A police report detailed how the drunken Trivino had repeatedly tried to kiss and fondle a female resident assistant on campus in December of 2011

The incident involving the former 
star hockey player happened on December 11, 2011, when Trivino 
confronted the victim, who was a resident assistant in the BU dorm, when
she tried to enforce quiet time on her floor, the Globe  reported.

Suffolk Assistant District Attorney 
Gloriann Moroney said that when the 23-year-old woman went to the noisy 
room, a drunken Trivino answered the door. According to Moroney and a 
Boston University police report filed in court, Trivino then followed 
the woman back to her residence.

The 190-pound, six-foot-one hockey 
player then repeatedly tried to force himself on the woman, and at one 
point lay down on her bed and proclaimed he was going to sleep there.

When the victim told Trivino to go 
back to his room, the player ‘started kissing her...and groping her 
breast area,’ police said in the report. The woman ordered Trivino to 
stop and leave.

Trivino complied, but then returned 
moments later, pushed the door open and again tried to kiss the 
23-year-old, but she managed to shove him away, according to the police 
report.

The victim told Trivino that ‘you 
need to stop’ and ‘you need to go,’ police wrote. But the young man 
instead cornered her by the desk and continued to kiss her even as she 
pushed him away from her and out the door.

But the player returned once again, 
pushed his way into the room, tried to kiss the woman and then declared
that he will spend the night in the woman’s bed, after which he took 
off his shoes and lay down, police said.

Punishment: In August, Trivino was sentenced to two years of probation during which he must be tested randomly for alcohol use and attend weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings

The woman contacted a school official
who told her to call BU police. At that point, Trivino left the dorm 
room and was picked up by officers who came to investigative the 
disturbance.

In the wake of his arrest, Trivino was removed from the BU hockey team. 

During a hearing in August, the 
victim said in her impact statement that the incident ‘has affected every
ounce’ of her being. On his part, Trivino responded by apologizing for 
his behavior that night.

Trivino's name was back in the spotlight this week following the release of a shocking report that exposed the sexual antics of university hockey stars at a controversial championship party.

The scandal exploded after Boston University released a report on the 'culture of sexual entitlement' by its hockey team.

Troubling: Lurid details have emerged of the sexual antics of Boston University hockey players at a controversial championship party - which includes students having sex in the penalty box

Many of the details of the 
investigation - which includes tales of sexual debauchery - were only 
revealed in confidential subcommittee reports.

However,
these documents - which have been reported by the Boston Globe - paint a
worrying picture of the attitude of some of the university's hockey 
players towards sex.

The report contained details of a late-night championship party in 2009 at the Agganis Arena which revealed that:

Details of the party have now only emerged after a task force was launched in February when two Boston University hockey players were charged with sexual assault.

The investigation by the task force found that some hockey players - when surrounded by fans - had 'the perception that they need not seek consent for sexual contact.'

One player told investigators: 'You don’t ask [permission for sex] when you are drunk.'

The task force was told by one female
student that a hockey player had put his hands down her pants at a 
party and, despite the fact that she was punching him, refused to stop.

When asked why she had not reported the incident to authorities, she replied: 'that’s just what [BU hockey players] do.'

The reports also found that some hockey players at the university boast about their sexual exploits on Facebook, often referring to conquests as 'kills'.

Many of the hockey players, the investigation found, regularly engage in group sex.

The university campus police and administrators did not find out about the controversial 2009 party until this year once the task force investigation started.

Party goers were having sex in the penalty box, drank from beer kegs in the locker room showers and took to the ice naked to shoot ice pucks. Players also put on Facebook their female conquests

It has emerged that during interviews with investigators hockey coach Jack Parker said at first that he did not know about the party. However, he later acknowledged that he knew some of the men had been drinking in the locker room.

Despite this, two players and a member of staff said that within a few days of the party, the coach had reprimanded the team for its behaviour.

The subcommittee report also found that some of the hockey players are less academically gifted than the vast majority of their classmates.

One professor described how six hockey players intimidated their classmates and answered their mobile phones during lectures. Eventually, all six of the players dropped out of the class. However, another professor said hockey players were respectful and prepared.

Following a recommendation by the task force, Parker has been stripped of the title of executive athletic director. He still keeps another title.

However, he will still continue as coach and will earn the same salary.

The public report has made 14 recommendations, which the university intends to implement.
