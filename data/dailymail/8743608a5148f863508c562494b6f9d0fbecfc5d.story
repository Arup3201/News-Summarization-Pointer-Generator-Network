A hoarder died after it is believed he became trapped inside his flat by piles of his possessions as a massive fire ripped through his home.

It is believed that Robert Crane, 61, a talented musician, was trapped in his seventh floor flat by hoarded items including guitars and amps as the blaze took hold in Kingsdown, Bristol.

Neioghbours, who paid tribute to the 
'kind and caring' man, said they had tried on several 
occasions to get him help to clear his flat.

Robert Crane died after a fire broke out at his flat. Around forty fire-fighters battled the blaze at a block of homes in Kingsdown, Bristol. He was aid to have been trapped inside his flat by piles of his possessions

It is thought Mr Crane, known to neighbours as Bob, was unable to escape the flames due to the amount of clutter in his home.

Susan Hill, 40, who lived directly below him, said: 'He was a lovely bloke, really kind and caring.

'He didn’t have a bad bone in his body. He used to love music and would play it on the weekends.

'Unfortunately he probably did get trapped in there. The council had been told time and time again and they just seem to have done nothing.

'It was no good just talking to him. Something needed to be done. People said he needed to go to a residential place to be looked after properly.'

More than 100 people were evacuated from the tower block in Kingsdown, Bristol, after the fire broke out.

Around 40 fire-fighters battled the flames at around 11am on Saturday morning. Crews were unable to reach Mr Crane, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

Another resident, Richard Angove, 46, who lives on the fourth floor of the building with his two children, said that it was a miracle no one else was hurt during the fire,

He said: 'It was terrible.

'There was rubbish everywhere in there. Amps and guitars were stacked up and the corridor was virtually blocked.

'I had complained to the council but nobody helped him. They had been up there to try and clean it out but I don’t know what happened.

A spokesperson for Avon Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that an investigation into the fire was underway but that it had not yet concluded

Neighbours say Mr Crane, who lived alone, hoarded all kinds of things - including piles of guitars and amps. They paid tribute to a 'kind and caring' man, who 'didn't have a bad bone in his body'

'I thought before that he’s going to kill someone or kill himself one day. I just find it a disgrace that it has come to this.'

A spokesperson for Avon Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that an investigation into the fire was underway but that it had not yet concluded.

It is thought that Robert had lived in the property for around 14 years.

A spokesperson for Bristol City Council added: 'This has been a tragic incident and our thoughts are with everyone involved.

'Before the fire service establishes the cause of the fire and the outcome of any subsequent inquest is published it would be inappropriate for the council to comment on how or if the fire could have been prevented.'
