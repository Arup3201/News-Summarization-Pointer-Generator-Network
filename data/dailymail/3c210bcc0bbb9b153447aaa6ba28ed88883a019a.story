The decomposing body of a young woman found 30ft up an oak tree in Australia has been identified as a missing U.S. tourist who was working abroad as a live-in nanny and allegedly committed suicide.

The remains of Melissa Joy Dietzel, 22, of Redlands, California, were found by a tree surgeon on January 12 in the Randwick area of Sydney, after reports of a foul smell coming from the tree.

Ms Dietzel - who was identified through missing person's records, dental details and her U.S. clothing - had not been living in the tree before her death, despite reports to the contrary, police said.

Discovery: The body of Melissa-Joy Dietzel, a U.S. tourist, was found 30ft up a tree in Randwick, Sydney, last month. She has just been identified

Mystery: A forensic officer gathers evidence from the tree where Ms Dietzel died. She is thought to have been dead for at least two weeks before her body was found on January 12

The young girl travelled from the U.S.
to Australia in November on a visa after finishing her studies in 
elementary education at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, an 
anonymous friend said.

'She was big about the outdoors so she
was stoked about being in Australia,’ the friend told the Sydney 
Morning Herald. ‘She was the one that cheered everyone up and talked to 
everyone.’

'She always made me smile when I was 
having a horrid day,’ another friend wrote on her Facebook page. ‘She 
also gave fabulous hugs. Sometimes it's the little things that matter 
the most.’

She may have been dead in the tree for
two weeks. Residents began complaining about a foul smell in the area 
on January 4, but thought it was caused by a cat or possum that had died
in the area.

Clothing: The young woman was found with long brown hair and a black hair clip holding a plastic flower. She was wearing an Outlaw green jumper, pictured, a No Boundaries top and Jasmine USA leggings

Discovery: Melissa Joy Dietzel's body was found in Randwick, a suburb of Sydney in New South Wales

The tree and the fence underneath it 
have since been removed after they became contaminated by Ms Dietzel's 
decaying body. Her death is not being treated as suspicious but instead 
as a suicide.

Friend of Melissa Joy Dietzel

Detectives said on finding the body 
that it had decomposed so much that the fingerprints might not even be 
visible. Residents were perplexed when the body was brought down 
from the tree.

Danyane Bowing, 35, who lived next 
door to the tree, said she thought the woman may have walked through her
garden around New Year's Eve and climbed her fence into the tree.

‘I'm no expert on decomposing bodies 
in summer time,’ she told the Sydney Morning Herald. ‘But when I went 
out around the start of the New Year I remember thinking something 
smelled dead.'

Ms Dietzel, who was working as a nanny
in Sydney but let go by her host family, came from a very large family 
with around eight siblings. She had been missing for more than a month 
when found.
