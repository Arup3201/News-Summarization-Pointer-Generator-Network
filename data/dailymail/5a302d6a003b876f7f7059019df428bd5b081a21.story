Sportsmail cricket writer Lawrence Booth's view of day four of the third Test between England and India at the Ageas Bowl, which saw James Anderson, Moeen Ali, Joe Root and Alastair Cook star.

TWO STARS FOR COOK 

Alastair Cook's unbeaten 70 set up England’s second declaration of the match.

It also meant he had passed 50 twice in the same Test for the first time since he made 96 and 106 against Sri Lanka at Lord’s in 2011.

What were we all worried about?

PANKAJ PLUMBS THE DEPTHS

Poor old Pankaj Singh deserved better than match figures in his first Test of 0 for 179.

But the harsh fact was that he had produced the worst match analysis by a debutant in Test cricket.

The previous record was held by Pakistan seamer Sohail Khan, who took 0 for 164 against Sri Lanka at Karachi in 2009.

NOT SUCH A DARING DECLARATION 

The timing of Alastair Cook’s second-innings declaration annoyed some on social media, though most observers felt he got it spot on.

History, though, suggested he could have called a halt much earlier.

India’s highest successful fourth-innings run chase in England is a modest 174 for six at The Oval in 1971.

Cushion: Cook declared to leave India needing 445 to win but they have never chased more than 174 in England

UMPIRES' JUSTICE IS OUT OF BALLANCE 

Gary Ballance confirmed he was more than a grinder by batting attractively for 38 from 48 balls before falling for the second time in the game to a duff umpiring decision.

Rod Tucker had wrongly judged him caught behind off Rohit Sharma for 156.

On Wednesday it was Marais Erasmus’s turn to err, giving Ballance out caught at short leg off Ravindra Jadeja.

JADEJA APPEALS FINE 

The ICC have confirmed that the Indian board have appealed against the fine levelled at Ravindra Jadeja by match referee David Boon over his run-in with Jimmy Anderson in the Trent Bridge pavilion.

Boon fined Jadeja 50 per cent of his match fee - around £3,500 - but India hope to get this overturned on Friday, when Anderson will learn his fate.

KALLIS KNOWS HIS INTERNATIONAL RACE IS RUN 

South Africa's colossal all-rounder Jacques Kallis announced his retirement from all international cricket on Wednesday.

He decided enough was enough on a recent tour of Sri Lanka.

‘I just knew on that tour that I was done,’ said the 38-year-old, who will continue to play Twenty20 franchise cricket.

He finished with 11,579 one-day international runs, 273 wickets and 131 catches.
