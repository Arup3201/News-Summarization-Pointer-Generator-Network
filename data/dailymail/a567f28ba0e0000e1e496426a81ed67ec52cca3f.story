Those of a more wholesome disposition, look away now.

Because below is a shocking - and equally creepy - depiction of what a futuristic female ‘sex robot’ might look like on the inside.

The computer generated image reveals the complex wires and circuitry that might be in machines one day - among other more, ahem, risqué features.

Would you? A French artist has created a depiction of futuristic 'sex robots' (shown). The bizarre - and creepy - images reveal the 'innards' of androids. They include artificial organs and a mechanical spine. But more unnervingly, they also have artificial 'reproductive organs'. Some experts believe androids could become partners for humans in future

The image was created by French artist César Vonc. On his website he called it the ‘new invention of the next century.’

The computer generated image was made for a robotic contest this year using a programme called Cinema 4D and rendered with Octane Render.

Earlier this year two cybernetics experts gave their views on how robots might reproduce.

Novelist George Zarkadakis said robots that are both silicon and carbon based, could have sex at a molecular level to produce offspring - although how this could happen is unclear.

AI expert Professor Noel Sharkey, meanwhile, said that there might not be any need to look at molecules as robots can be 'bred' by swapping software, so the code used to make robots perform certain tasks particularly well can be combined to create a 'child'.

He believes that robots of the future will be able to print their offspring, a little like a 3D printer, but could assemble them too.

And Mr Zarkadis said if robots could have sex, it would defend them from computer viruses and make them more robust. 

The cutaway image appears to bear some resemblance to a crash test dummy on the exterior.

The interior, though, is a different story.

Running down the ‘back’ of the robot is a metallic spine, obviously intending to replicate the real thing.

Elsewhere other organs area also recreated in all-too-accurate CGI.

Humorously - or bizarrely, depending on your view of this art piece - there’s also a handy arrow in a suggestive position.

Despite its rather not-safe-for-work tone, though, the piece does at least provide what may be an accurate depiction of futuristic robots.

Namely, as attempts are made to make machines more and more human, it stands to reason we might some day create a robot with such artificial organs.

And aside from lungs, a heart, bones and more, this may also include other artificial organs of a reproductive nature. 

Earlier this year a study looked at how robots could replace several jobs in the next ten years. 

The One Poll survey, which marked the launch of a new sci-fi TV police drama called Almost Human, said in a decade streets could be governed my RoboCop-style police, taxis could drive themselves and prostitutes could be replaced by ‘sexbots’.

It found that people feared the rise of artificial technology, and felt many jobs could be replaced sooner rather than later by machines.

Look familiar? Despite its rather not-safe-for-work tone, though, the piece does at least provide what may be an accurate depiction of attempts to make futuristic robots more 'human'

1. Military/soldiers (45 per cent)

2. Industry/factory workers and labourers (33 per cent)

3. Space exploration/astronauts (33 per cent)

4. Domestic chores/cleaners (23 per cent)

5. Motoring/chauffeurs and taxi drivers (20 per cent)

6. Policing/policemen and women (10 per cent)

7. Transport/train driver, pilots, truckers (8 per cent)

8. Service industry/shop assistant, customer service, waiters, bartenders (8 per cent)

9. Sex and sex workers (4 per cent)

10. Cooking/chefs (3 per cent) 

Among the top jobs people think will be replaced by robots by 2025 include soldiers (45 per cent), factory workers (33 per cent) and astronauts (33 per cent).

The research also revealed many people think education will soon be led by androids, with 42 per cent believing teachers could be replaced by robots in the classroom in the future, and more than a tenth thinking it could happen in the next 20 years.

And 17 per cent of those questioned said they’d happily have sex with an android, while 29 per cent admitted they had no problem with other people enjoying android sex.

More than one in ten even said they would like robotic offpsring, while nearly a fifth of pet owners said they would consider replacing a beloved animal with a robot.

Dr Martin Smith, professor of robotics at the University of Middlesex, who oversaw the survey, said: ‘I would expect robots to develop levels of emotional intelligence that will be greater than many humans including: thinking, judgement, problem solving, openness, self-control, self-analysis, and paying attention to and identifying people’s feelings and emotions, for example.’

But he said that we do not need to feat a robot uprising just yet, adding: ‘Robots are being applied in fields described as the three Ds, that is, tasks that are dirty, dangerous or dull.

‘The jobs most at risk are low-skill, routine, highly-structured, simple, and rule based, in environments that are static and structured. 

'It is unlikely that all the humans will be replaced by robots in any task, it is much more likely that fewer people will be needed because for many years robots will be assistants.

'The future is most likely to be one of productivity gains rather than mass redundancies.’
