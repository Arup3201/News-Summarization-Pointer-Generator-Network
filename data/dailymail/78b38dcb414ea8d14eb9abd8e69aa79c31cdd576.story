A casino boat carrying around 100 passengers on its maiden trip from Savannah ran aground overnight and remained stranded Wednesday after tow lines broke in the Coast Guard's initial attempts to free it.

The Escapade was supposed to return about 12:30 a.m., and those aboard, wearing life vests, were growing annoyed, though no injuries were reported, according to the Coast Guard and family members awaiting the passengers' return in Savannah.

Kia Murray's fiancee called her from the ship about 1 p.m., 13 hours after the ship ran aground.

'He just said everybody had been 
getting a little irritated from being out there overnight,' said Murray,
 of Savannah. 'But they're keeping them calm. He said they're giving 
them food and water.'

Crews 
now plan to put those aboard the Escapade - 96 passengers and 27 crew 
members - onto Coast Guard boats that can hold about eight people, then 
transfer them to a larger vessel, the cutter Maria Bray, Petty Officer 
1st Class Lauren Jorgensen said.

The
 174-foot-long Escapade was about 1.8 miles off the north end of Tybee 
Island, a popular beach destination east of Savannah, in the Calibogue 
Sound near Hilton Head, South Carolina, the Coast Guard said.

The Coast Guard received reports that the vessel had run aground around midnight Tuesday, officials said.

The
 initial report from the Escapade's crew was about a malfunction of the 
chart plotter, part of the navigation system, Jorgenson told The 
Associated Press.

But she said the Coast Guard hadn't been able to confirm any malfunction yet.

The Escapade is a casino ship operated by Florida-based Tradewinds Casino Cruise.

Tried and exhausted: The gamblers weren't expecting such a long voyage

The
 company's Facebook page said that Tuesday night was to be the maiden 
voyage for its Savannah cruise service and passengers were invited to 
board for free.

Tradewinds 
Casino Cruise did not immediately respond to phone messages left at the 
company's Savannah office and its headquarters in Madeira Beach, 
Florida.

About 50 cars were 
in Tradewinds' parking lot Wednesday afternoon. A security gate at the 
dock was closed, and a guard said he was the only employee there.

Tommy Eaton of nearby Pooler, Georgia, came to Tradewinds' Savannah dock at noon Wednesday.

She brought a pain pill for her husband, Mark Eaton, to take for his bad back when he is able to get off the boat.

She
 said her husband called about 12:30 a.m. 'He said, 'Something is just 
not right with this boat. It has lots of black smoke coming out the 
back, and it's leaning to one side,'' Eaton said.

After a sleepless night, Eaton said, her husband called again at 7 a.m.

'He
 just said they were sitting there waiting for the Coast Guard,' Eaton 
said. 'He said everybody looked fine. They were just ready to get off 
the boat.' Then, she said, his phone went dead.

The
 casino boat's first Savannah cruise was scheduled to run from 7 p.m. 
Tuesday until 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, according to the company's website.

It
 describes the vessel as a three-story ship capable of carrying 500 
passengers. It's outfitted with slot machines, poker and blackjack 
tables and a roulette wheel.

'My
 understanding is the ship has generators to provide power,' Jorgensen 
said, though she didn't know many specifics about conditions on board.

'The
 area is too shallow for our boats to come alongside so we do not 
actually have personnel on board,' she said. 'They can see the vessel; 
they just can't get on scene.'

The
 casino boat was not impeding ships sailing to and from the Port of 
Savannah, said Robert Morris, a spokesman for the Georgia Ports 
Authority.
