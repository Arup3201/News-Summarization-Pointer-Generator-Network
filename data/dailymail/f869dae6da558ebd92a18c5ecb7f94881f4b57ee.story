An entire street has missed out on Christmas cards and presents this year after Royal Mail banned all deliveries following an incident involving a postman being bitten by a dog - five months ago.

Residents of Chestnut Grove, in Sandiacre, Nottinghamshire, have had to trek to a post office a mile away every day for the past five months if they wanted their post on time.

But now Royal Mail have announced they will begin delivering to the street again from tomorrow.

Residents of Chestnut Grove, in Sandiacre, Nottinghamshire, have had to trek to a post office a mile away every day for five months after a dog bit a postman while he was making his deliveries to the street

However, outraged residents say over the last few months they have repeatedly missed out on important post.

They say they don't understand how local newspaper deliveries have been able to make it  while the postman has not.

Karen Rowell, 56, said she received a letter from Royal Mail on August 4 stating that deliveries were cancelled until further notice.

The nursing home worker said: 'There are a lot of people on the street that can't make it to the post office every day because they work or are very elderly and they are left missing out on important letters.

'I missed an eye check-up for my Glaucoma because the appointment card didn't make it to me in time.

'When I missed picking up my post for a week, I got behind on a bill and got fined.

'It's just absolutely outrageous.'

Residents living in the 10 homes were initially asked to make six mile round trip to Long Eaten but after protests about the elderly people on the street, post was rerouted to Sandiacre post office.

Despite the apparent risk to postmen, local paper deliveries and takeaway leaflets have continued to make it through the letter boxes of all the residents.

Roy Lewin, 60, said he was forced to get his post redirected to his work address so  he did not miss important letters and deliveries.

He said: 'I know it all started off when a dog on the street bit a postman but as far as I'm aware it was all resolved in the courts over a month ago. 

'So I don't know why we're still not getting deliveries.

'Why does it have to be the whole street anyway? Couldn't they just have missed out that house?

'The people at the post office say there is nothing they can do.

'If the meter reader, the gas man and the local paper delivery boy can make it, why can't the postman?

'It's a burden and a nuisance for everyone and it is so disappointing that nothing has been done.' 

Royal Mail have announced today that they will be resuming deliveries to the street from tomorrow

Another resident Brian Kirk, 81, said he is fed up of the two-mile round trip to Sandiacre Post Office to pick up his mail.

He said: 'I haven't had my mail for months. I can understand why they don't deliver to the house with the dog, but why should I suffer? It's ridiculous.'

Mr Kirk, who has lived on the street since 1966, said: 'I have breathing problems and need my inhalers. I only feel like I can make that trip once a week. Sometimes bills arrive late and I end up behind.'

Roy Pearson, 84, also of Chestnut Grove, said he has only seen the dog allegedly involved in the incident outside twice.

'I don't fancy picking up my Christmas cards from the Post Office,' he said. 'I understand if it was just that house they were not delivering to, but there are a lot of elderly people on the street. 

'It's an absolute farce.'

A Royal Mail spokesman said today: 'We had to temporarily suspend mail deliveries to a number of houses on Chesnut Grove following a serious dog attack on one of our postmen, which resulted in a successful prosecution. 

'We would like to apologise to affected customers and reassure them that deliveries will be reinstated tomorrow.'

The postman who was bitten, who did not want to be named, said: 'I've got puncture marks on my elbow and a puncture mark on my back.

'I'm not frightened of dogs but it has changed my whole perception of them.

'For the first few weeks if there was a dog on a drive or in a house I wouldn't go in.' 

The dog owner's son, Michael Bandari, 28, apologised and said that the dog had never caused any problems before.

He said: 'The dog has been living there for eight years and had never attacked anyone before.

'To my neighbours who have been affected I'm so sorry.

'I didn't realise what was happening with the post, so I do apologise for the inconvenience.'
