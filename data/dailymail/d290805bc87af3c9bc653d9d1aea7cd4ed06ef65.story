The New South Wales government has netted $2.27 million after selling the fifth terrace at Millers Point, an inner-city suburb of Sydney, on Thursday night.

The heritage-listed property at 86 Windmill Street sold at auction for over half a million more than the price  quoted to potential buyers at inspection.

The three-levelled terrace offers a slight view of Sydney's Harbour Bridge and is located on a local park called 'The Paddock'.

The state government has netted $2.27 million after selling the fifth terrace at Millers Point, an inner-city suburb of Sydney, on Thursday night

The property embraces a 1880s design with modern finishes, a functional gas kitchen and is filled with natural light. It features separate lounge and dining areas and an attic located on the top floor.

Although the property is immediately liveable, the property requires  full renovation.

But the run-down property did not stop a crowd of 70 pre-registered bidders from flocking to Di Jones head office in Woollahra. The bidders were expected to bring photo identification on the night of the auction.

The bidding started at $1 million but swiftly increased in increments of $100,000 and was called to the market once it hit $2.25 million mark, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.  

The new owner of the property is supposedly an investor who  attended the two previous Millers Point auctions.

All five state government properties at Millers Point have sold for well above the price guides and have seen the New South Wales government pocket just under $13.4 million.

The remarkable sale results could see Millers Point as Sydney's next prestige suburb, according to real estate agents.

'The sales agents received more than 1370 enquiries, conducted around 200 property inspections and issued over 70 pre-auction contracts', said Dominic Perrottet, the Minister for Finance and Services.
