The feud between Ken Elliot and his neighbour has dragged on for 17 years.

And with the row being over the increasing height of Dale Woolley’s conifer trees, Mr Elliot has been on the losing side... until now.

After years of complaining that the trees, as high as 20ft, blocked out the sunlight and harboured flies that would fly into his house, officials have finally come down on Mr Elliot’s side and ordered that Mr Woolley’s ‘personal forest’ in Cannock, Staffordshire, must be cut down.

Personal forest: Ken Elliot has blamed his neighbour for allowing the conifers to grow so high they block out his light

Gloomy: Mr Elliot stares out from one of the upstairs rooms, which has been in the shadow of his neighbour's conifers for years

Mr Elliot, 55, said: ‘It is quite ridiculous. My wife and I feel like prisoners in our own home.

'We cannot open the windows as there are too many bugs and we don’t get any natural light in our living room.’

He said the row began in 1996 when he spoke to his neighbour about uprooting a hedge and building a wall to separate the two properties.

Mr Elliot said Mr Woolley agreed, but then planted eight large conifer trees.

‘I was gobsmacked', said the ex-miner, 55. ‘It is was if he did it out of spite for getting rid of the hedge.’

Two years ago the Elliots noticed cracks appearing in their wall and took legal action.

Feud: The dispute first started back in 1996 when Mr Elliot made a gift of two miniature conifers to his neighbour

When a local newspaper contacted Mr Woolley’s home, his son Tristan said they liked having their own ‘private forest’.

Now Cannock Chase Council has made an order under the Anti-Social Behaviour Act that the two main conifer trees be cut to 5ft by September 28 and should never exceed 6ft 6ins.

Mr Elliot said: ‘I understand people have the right to live how they want but you need to be reasonable. I cannot wait to be able to finally open my windows and have a bit of sunlight through them.

Order: Cannock Chase Council has now ruled Dale Woolley has to lop the 20ft trees back down to the more reasonable height of 5ft
