The most luxurious, exclusive and powerful production Range Rover ever launched has broken cover in New York – with a £150,000 price tag to match.

From the company that is providing most of the villains’ cars in the new 007 movie ‘SPECTRE’, the new flagship 4X4 has been specially engineered at Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) new elite Special Vehicle Operations unit. 

It was unveiled today at the New York International Motor Show in the US - one of the company’s biggest export markets.

The luxurious, exclusive and powerful Range Rover SVAutobiography has broken cover in New York, and comes with a £150,000 price tag

The SVAutobiography is designed to take the Range Rover to ‘another level of comfort, craftsmanship and refinement’, coming with luxurious seating and a chiller compartment

The ‘special ops’ arm of JLR has fitted the Range Rover SVAutobiography with a powerful supercharged 5-litre V8 engine which develops a staggering 539bhp of pulling-power – equivalent to five Ford Fiestas.

It is the sort of power normally found in an Italian supercar - and gives the off-roader a top speed of around 150mph.

But JLR stress that it isn’t just about performance on and off-road. The SVAutobiography is designed to take the Range Rover to ‘another level of comfort, craftsmanship and refinement’.

A spokesman said: 'The SVAutobiography is the most luxurious and powerful series-production Range Rover in the model’s successful 45-year history.’

The unique front grille is finished in distinctive Graphite Atlas and polished chrome.

Passengers in the back can relax in luxurious seating complete with a chiller compartment and powered deployable tables.

Stowed in the boot and hand-crafted from Windsor leather, two seats can be deployed to provide comfortable chairs on the tailgate

Solid aluminium coat hooks are incorporated into the rear pillars while, on the floor, aluminium seat rail finishers and deep twist pile mohair carpet mats add to the luxurious feel.

John Edwards, managing director of Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations, said: ‘Range Rover originally defined the luxury SUV segment and the new SVAutobiography, developed by Special Vehicle Operations, takes Range Rover to another level of comfort, craftsmanship and refinement.'

The car also has what Jaguar Land Rover is calling ‘event seating’. Stowed in the boot and hand-crafted from Windsor leather, the two seats can be deployed to provide comfortable chairs for adults who want to sit on the tailgate.

A spokesman for JLR’s Special Vehicle Operations division said: 'For the first time on a Range Rover, customers of the 2016 Model Year SVAutobiography are able to specify a unique duo-tone body colour option. 

'The combination of Santorini Black upper body and nine colour choices for the lower body create true distinction and individualism.

Finishing touc: The detailing continues to both the front and rear centre consoles, with distinctive materials for cup holders and socket covers

Distinctive: The new flagship 4X4 has been specially engineered at Jaguar Land Rover’s new elite Special Vehicle Operations unit

‘Much of the driver’s switchgear, including the start-stop surround and rotary controls, are machined from solid aluminium with beautiful knurled details, as are the foot pedals. This detailing continues to both the front and rear centre consoles, with distinctive materials for the cup holder and socket covers. 

'New armrest adjusters not only bring a similar level of machined detail, but also make them even easier to use.’

A leather-covered handbook and polished ‘Autobiography’ key fob with knurled finish add finishing touches.

Prices for the Range Rover SVAutobiography start at £148,900 – or twice the cost of an entry-level Range Rover and around the same price as the long-awaited Bentley Bentayga 4X4, which goes on sale next year.

Gerry McGovern, Land Rover’s design director and chief creative officer, added: ‘With the SVAutobiography we have taken the opportunity to optimise the Range Rover’s luxury execution and precision while delivering beautiful detailing that considerably enhances the customer’s experience of our flagship vehicle.’
