If you overindulged this Christmas and are looking to jump on the New Year diet bandwagon, our favourite A-list health guru is here to help.

Health advocate Gwyneth Paltrow has unveiled a January detox meal plan, which she promises is 'warming, filling and doesn't feel like a sacrifice'.

While the 41-year-old probably didn't shovel in as much stuffing and Christmas pudding as we did this festive season, she has joined forces with a nutritionist to create a healthy and cleansing meal plan.

It's detox o'clock! Gwyneth Paltrow, an avid foodie, has unveiled a January detox menu, which she promises doesn't feel like a sacrifice

Writing on her site Goop, she says: 'You know we love a good detox here at goop, and this January is no exception.

'We created detox recipes that won't leave you feeling cold and hungry during the winter months, with guidance from Dr. Alejandro Junger, a specialist on the subject.

'We took to the test kitchen to create a three-day menu of detox recipes that are warming and filling and don't feel like a sacrifice.

'We then turned to Dr. Alejandro Junger for some info on how to best detox during the cold winter months. Dr. Junger contributed the warm shakes - the rest of the recipes are from the goop kitchen.'

The menu advises detoxers to start the day with room temperature water and lemon, followed by a herbal tea and special shake.

Lunch consists of either a balsamic miso root salad or chickpea or carrot soup (bread rolls not included, obviously).

If you're feeling peckish in the afternoon, Gwyneth suggests snacking on walnut lentil pate or a handful of nuts before feasting on coconut poached salmon, quinoa stuffed squash or pan-steamed chicken and broccoli for dinner.

'Adjust the times to your schedule and the meals to your taste,' advises the actress.

What, no carbs? Plenty of herbal teas, salads, soups and oily fish feature on Gwyneth's menu

Foodies will be delighted to hear that this winter detox is much less strict than ones Gwyneth and her team have created in the past.

'Our winter detox has looser guidelines and restrictions than ones we’ve done in the past but', she adds, 'here is what we’re avoiding: dairy, gluten, shellfish, anything processed (including all soy products), nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and eggplant), condiments, sugar, alcohol, caffeine and soda,' she writes.

The mother-of-two is well-known for her strict health regime and even released her own cook book, It's All Good, in 2012.

Wise words: Gwyneth, who last year released a cookbook with her dietary tips, writes a weekly lifestyle blog

According to the book's synopsis, after a
 gruelling schedule and overindulgence in 2011, Gwyneth was 
left feeling fatigued and faint and a trip to the doctor later revealed 
that she was anaemic, vitamin D deficient, and that her stress levels 
were sky high.

Her doctor prescribed an elimination 
diet banning coffee, alcohol, sugar, eggs, wheat, meat and processed 
food to clear out her system and help her body heal.

Now we can ALL look like Gwyneth: The detox eliminates dairy, gluten, shellfish, anything processed (including all soy products), nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and eggplant), condiments, sugar, alcohol, caffeine and soda
