Lionel Messi had no right to win FIFA's Golden Ball and was only handed the award because of a 'marketing plan' according to Diego Maradona.

Argentina's talisman was voted the World Cup's most impressive individual, despite failing to score in any of their knockout games and cut a peripheral figure in the final.

The decision has caused uproar across the globe, with conspiracy theories as to why Messi won rife immediately after the announcement.

Didn't deserve it! Diego Maradona says Messi's award was a marketing plan instead of a genuine prize

And Maradona is no different.

‘I would give him heaven if possible,’ he said during his show on Telesur. ‘But it's not right when someone wins something that he shouldn't have won just because of some marketing plan.’

Argentina's wait for the biggest prize in football will now extend until at least a 32nd year after Mario Gotze's extra time winner broke South American hearts.

‘I feel sorry for my country,' Maradona added. 'Mario Gotze's goal really hurt. There's a huge sadness in my heart that we lost the final,’ he said.

‘All things put together, I think Argentina deserved at least penalties. That Germany won was the result of a misunderstanding in the Argentine defense.’

And he even had time to question the tactical nuances of Alejandro Sabella by suggesting the head coach made the wrong substitutions.

‘I don't understand the substitution of Lavezzi,' Maradona said. 'He was phenomenal down the wing. Kun Aguero didn't have the same impact. It was not his tournament.’
