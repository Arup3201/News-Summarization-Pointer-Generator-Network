Like father like son? NFL legend Lawrence Taylor's son Lawrence Taylor Junior, pictured, has been arrested in Georgia for alleged statutory rape, sodomy and child molestation

The son of NFL star Lawrence Taylor has been accused of statutory rape and sodomy just three years after his father faced charges for sexually assaulting a minor.

Police were called to a home in Powder Springs, Georgia, at 5 p.m. Saturday, where an underage female claimed Lawrence Taylor Junior had forcibly performed oral sex on her.

Another minor at the scene told officers Taylor Jr., 32, had sex with her five or six times in February 2012, according to a warrant.

The first accuser said the son of the ex-New York Giants star 'asked her if he could (perform oral sex on her) repeatedly in which she stated no,' according to TMZ.

Next, he allegedly 'with force spread her legs then pulled her bathing suit to the side and gave her oral sex.'

Taylor Jr. was charged with aggravated sodomy and child molestation for the alleged forced oral sex on the first young girl.

'Sodomy' generally refers to anal sex but can also refer to oral sex.

He was also arrested on July 7 on suspicion of statutory rape for allegedly having repeated sex with the second minor.

The NFL legend's son was born in 1981 and is listed at 6'1" and 230 lbs. According to TMZ, he has a Japanese symbol tattooed on his back and multiple tattoos on his shoulders.

The former Giants linebacker was 
arrested in 2010 after having sex with the then-16-year-old girl in a 
hotel room in Montebello, just north of New York City.

Taylor, 54, eventually pleaded guilty to one count of patronizing a prostitute and one count of sexual misconduct.

His
accuser, Cristina Fierro, claims that an abusive pimp forced her to 
have sex with Taylor for $300. She sued Taylor in federal court in 
Manhattan, claiming he should be held accountable.

The Brooklyn-born Fierro, 19, wept 
while testifying in the 2012 trial that a hulking Taylor refused to stop
having sex with her, even after she told him it hurt and tried to push 
him away.

He was sentenced to six years probation with no jail time and was added to the sex offenders register.

During
his trial, Taylor Sr. admitted that he paid for sex with a 'very, very 
pretty' prostitute in 2010 but denied accusations that he ignored 
obvious signs she was a teen runaway in distress.

Taylor
told a Manhattan jury at the civil trial that he had a history of 
hiring women for 'company' when on the road but didn't expect them to 
automatically have sex with him.

'I still like the chase,' Taylor testified. But he added, 'I like to stack the odds in my favor... I don't like to work too hard.'

Fierro testified that the aggressive pimp forced her to sleep with Taylor.

'I kept telling him I didn't want to be there,' she said. 'He's much bigger than me. I couldn't do anything.'

She added that she told him it was her 'first time' and he replied, 'Just relax.'

'It was really rough and painful,' she said in court, adding thay she felt suicidal several months later and began taking medication for depression, insomnia and anxiety.

Fierro testified that when the sex was over Taylor 'just pulled out money and said, "Here, can you turn the TV off on your way out?"'
