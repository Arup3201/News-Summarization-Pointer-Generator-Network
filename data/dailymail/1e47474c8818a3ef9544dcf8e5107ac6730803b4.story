Sally Bercow has blundered into controversy again – by flogging antiques from her free home in Parliament.

The furniture is her own, but photographs of it in her eBay advertisements were clearly taken in the grace and favour apartments provided for her husband John, Speaker of the House of Commons.

And it appears that buyers of 43-year-old Mrs Bercow’s unwanted stuff were invited into the Houses of Parliament to pick up their purchases.

Up for auction: Sally Bercow, the Speaker's wife, sold £1,600 of antiques in an eBay blitz just weeks before she was handed a £100,000 bill for libelling a Tory peer on Twitter

Ad: This two-seat sofa auctioned by Sally Bercow went for £480, and clearly shows the Commons carpets and grand fixtures. She also asked for collection in person from Westmister

Controversial: Sally Bercow with her Commons Speaker husband John, whose Parliament flat she was using as a backdrop for all the adverts

A spokesman for the House of Commons last
night made clear that none of the items sold by Mr and Mrs Bercow was 
Parliament property, and insisted there were no security issues over 
buyers being invited into the Commons.

But keen observers of the misadventures of Mrs Bercow – nicknamed ‘Silly Sally’ by her many critics – will be curious about her motives for suddenly selling ten pieces of furniture at cut prices to raise more than £1,600 in a two-week auction frenzy.

She is certainly in need of ready cash. Last month she disastrously lost a libel claim brought against her by Tory peer Lord McAlpine, after she sent a tweet to her 56,000 followers falsely implying he was a paedophile.

Although she could have admitted she was at fault, she fought the case and lost, ending up with a bill for damages and costs thought to total more than £100,000.

And even her 50-year-old husband, with generous £142,000-a-year pay, plus expenses, and without the need to pay for a family home, will struggle to cover that.

The controversial £45,000 taxpayer- funded refurbishment of their apartment at the Houses of Parliament four years ago may also mean that some of their own furniture had become redundant.

Mrs Bercow has been a fanatical user of eBay for years – to a similar extent to fellow political wife and keen bargain hunter Cherie Blair.

Those she has bought from and sold to offer almost universal praise in Miss Bercow’s eBay ratings – although in March a seller offering a Heals light for £70 caustically said of her: ‘Fails to contact or complete sale. Unreliable, Rude and pompous in her messaging!

The antique furnishings were put up for sale in April, shortly before she was hit with her libel bill.

Feedback: One customer was very keen to buy some of the furniture up for sale, but was left unhappy with the contact he had with Mrs Bercow

eBay sale: Speaker's wife was selling items like this sofa on eBay weeks before she lost her high-profile libel case with Lord McAlpine, which will cost her £100,000

Grand: The Bercows live in a grace-and-favour flat in Parliament but it is not clear if buyers were asked inside to see the items they were buying

Auctions: All these items (top left to bottom right)  were sold, including one piece she said was worth £2,250 but sold for £250

Argument: The old oak items were auctioned by the Bercows because they would 'not work' in their new house

Mrs Bercow was so eager to sell that she let an 1890 oak dresser go for just £250 – despite claiming than an antiques dealer gave it a valuation of £2,250.

Also sold for £480 was a Duresta Loafer sofa, clearly pictured beside a grand  fireplace in the Bercows’ Parliament residence.

She said in her eBay advertisements: ‘I’m selling lots of quality antique and period-style furniture. Must be collected from central London, near Westminster Tube.’

And Mrs Bercow also made a clear reference to the £935,000 six-bed 1980s Thames-side townhouse in Battersea, south London, she and her husband bought in January.

Mrs Bercow wrote that the: ‘Antique and period-style furniture just won’t work in the new, modern house we bought recently.’

The Bercows are understood to have planned to let their modern Battersea house for £5,000 a month – although Westminster-watchers believe Mr Bercow fears losing his prestigious Commons role after the 2015 General Election. His fellow Tories are believed to have scant regard for him.

Ebay sellers have also told of how they have sold their own second-hand goods to Mrs Bercow, commenting that they were amazed to have her turn up at their homes in a rented van to collect her purchases.

Problems: Lawyers for Tory peer Lord McAlpine 
said he had suffered 'unnecessary pain' as a result of the court case 
while Mrs Bercow said the litigation had been a 'nightmare' - but she lost

Couple: Mrs Bercow is able to live in the Commons thanks to her husband John's job as Commons Speaker

She has spent more than £4,000 on eBay since February.

One surprised seller said: ‘It was a bit surreal to have the Speaker’s wife standing in my hallway.’  Last night a spokesman for the Commons said: ‘The items sold by Mr and Mrs Bercow were their own belongings.

‘And there are no concerns about security, as all visitors to the Parliamentary estate, including those to the Bercows’ home in Speaker’s House, undergo strict search procedures as a condition of entry and are restricted as to where they may go on the estate.’

The Bercows had a £45,000 refurbishment of their Parliament apartment within weeks of arriving there in 2009, all at taxpayers’ expense.
