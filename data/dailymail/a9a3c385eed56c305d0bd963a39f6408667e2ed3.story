A prehistoric fish that swam the oceans more than 500 million years ago may explain how vertebrates evolved jaws. 

The ancient creature had bulging eyes and a narrow, tapering body, measuring about two-and-a-half inches long.

Despite being small, the fish has caused a stir among scientists who say it fills in a key piece of the jigsaw in the evolution of humans - particularly how we came to get our jawbone.

A prehistoric fish (illustrated left) called Metaspriggina walcotti that swam the oceans more than 500 million years ago. Over 100 fossils (one pictured right) were unearthed which could help scientists explain how vertebrates evolved jaws

Previously, only two incomplete specimens of Metaspriggina walcotti - one of the earliest known and most primitive fish - had been discovered.

Until now, only two incomplete specimens 
of the primitive fish, known as Metaspriggina walcotti had been discovered.

The recent haul of a hundred new specimens were found in the Canadian Rockies.

The latest fossils show a well-preserved arrangement of muscles showing the fish was
 an active swimmer - not unlike a trout.

It saw the world through a pair of large eyes and sensed the surrounding environment with nasal structures.

But now a hundred new ones have been dug up at two sites in the Canadian Rockies, allowing researchers to produce an animated video of how the creature would have looked and moved.

The new fossils of Metaspriggina are remarkably well-preserved with the arrangement of muscles showing the fish was an active swimmer - not unlike a trout.

It saw the world through a pair of large eyes and sensed the surrounding environment with nasal structures.

Professor Simon Conway Morris, of Cambridge University, said: ‘The detail is stunning. Even the eyes are beautifully preserved and clearly evident.’

Professor Jean-Bernard Caron, of Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto said the new fish fossils show shows pairs of exceptionally well-preserved arches near the front of Metaspriggina's body.

The first of these - closest to the head - eventually led to the evolution of jaws in vertebrates, which is the first time this feature has been seen so early in the fossil record.

Fish fossils from the Cambrian period, around 500 million years ago, are very rare and usually poorly preserved. This new discovery shows in unprecedented detail how some of the earliest vertebrates developed. They led to later fish species, dinosaurs and mammals such as horses and even humans.

The specimens catalogued in the journal Nature were recovered from several locations including the world famous Burgess Shale site in British Colombia.

They shed new light on the Cambrian ‘explosion’ - a period of rapid evolution starting around 540 million years ago - when most major species of animals originated.

The fossils show for the first time how a series of rod-like structures known as the gill or branchial arches were arranged in the earliest vertebrates.

These have long been known to have played a vital role in the evolution of vertebrates - including the origin of jaws - and some of the tiny bones in the ear, which transmit sound in mammals.

It’s the ‘branchial’ arches which makes the discovery so important for scientists. The front pair is slightly thicker and this subtle distinction could be the very first step in an evolutionary change that led to the jaw.

Professor Conway Norris said: ‘Once the jaws have developed the whole world opens. Having a hypothetical model swim into the fossil record like this is incredibly gratifying.’

Professor  Caron explained that the discovery will help in understanding our own origins and the fossil sites have superb potential for revealing fascinating insights into the early evolution of many other animals.

He said: ‘Obviously jawed fish came later but this is like a starting post - everything is there and ready to go.’
