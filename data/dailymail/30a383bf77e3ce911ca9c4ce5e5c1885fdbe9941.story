The innocent taxi passenger killed in Thursday's dramatic Las Vegas strip shooting has been named today as Sandi Sutton-Wasmund, a mother-of-three, who had twice survived breast cancer and was described as 'the heart and soul' of her community.

Family and friends spoke of their grief today upon learning that the former chamber of commerce worker and shop-owner from Maple Valley, Washington, was one of the innocent bystanders killed in a pile up that followed a drive-by shooting in the resort.

Aspiring rapper Kenneth Cherry, 27, was shot dead in his Maserati in the gun attack on Thursday at a busy Las Vegas intersection overseen by some of the resorts best known hotels.

As he accelerated to try and escape 
the spray of bullets at around 4.20am he sped through a red light and 
smashed into six other vehicles, including the taxi.

It was immediately engulfed in flames 
killing driver Michael Boldon, the sole carer of his elderly mother, and
passenger Sutton-Wasmund, who was in town on business.

Today it emerged Cherry had hauntingly sung the lyric: 'One mistake change lives all in one night' on one of his tracks according to Fox News.

Sutton-Wasmund, 48, was in town for a trade show to buy clothes for her co-owned womenswear shop The Dazzled Dame.

She was described as 'the heart and 
soul' of her Washington community yesterday while one of her husband's 
colleagues tearfully said: 'This woman was everything to this 
community'.

She leaves behind her husband James, a 17-year-old son Austin, 12-year-old daughter Sarah and an 11-year-old son Hunter.

Family-centered Sutton-Wasmund who grew up 
locally lovingly posted pictures of her family on Facebook as well as 
images from her work as a tireless breast cancer campaigner.

She lost her mother to the disease in 
1990, an older sister in 2005 and saw another sister diagnosed in 2010. 
She was herself a two time survivor and was desperate to raise much 
needed funds for research into the disease.

Writing about why she was taking part 
in a 3-day walk in Seattle, she said: 'My daughter and I were driving in
the car the other day and she asked 
me, "Mom, am I going to get Breast Cancer?" That's the reason I decided 
to walk 
the 3-day. Why? Because Everyone Deserves a Lifetime.  Especially my 
daughter 
and all our families that we love and want to have with us forever. We 
can only Pray that this family is done!'

Last night her son Austin conveyed 
his grief by simply posting a picture of him and his mother hugging at a
breast cancer fundraising event.

A statement was released by the family today to King5.

'On behalf of Sandi’s family, Sandi was a loving wife, mother, 
daughter and sister,' it said.

'Her innocent and tragic loss will be felt by all of
those who knew and loved her and by the community at large. Her family 
appreciates the outpouring of love and support, and respect for privacy 
shown throughout this very difficult time."

Sandi was being driven by Michael 
Boldon, a 62-year-old taxi driver and grandfather who had moved to Vegas
to care for his 93-year-old mother a year and a half ago.

He was remembered as a bubbly car enthusiast.

Boldon's sister, Carolyn Jean Trimble told Fox news: 'Everybody just loved him. When that car hit that cab, Mike had to be in there talking and laughing.'

Police are still hunting for the men inside a black Range Rover who opened fire on Cherry's $120,000 silver sports car.

The car had blacked-out windows and a temporary paper license according to the authorities

Investigators believe the incident 
followed a fight in the valet area of the Aria Resort and Casino 
following a rap concert at the hotel.

An unidentified passenger in Cherry's 
car escaped with minor injuries to his arm - neither he nor Cherry are 
believed to have fired any shots.

He was said to be in Las Vegas 
pursuing his music career and had recently posted to videos on YouTube -
in one he sings about hiding a gun in his sports car, police have not 
said if he was armed on Thursday.

The shooting took place just two blocks 
from the spot where rapper Tupac Shakur was infamously gunned down.

Cherry's family said he was a 'decent kid' and was not involved in any kind of crime.

The aspiring rapper from Northern California had no criminal record

'I want to make it clear that my son was no gangster or nothing like 
that,' his father, also Kenneth, said.

'He moved to Vegas about six year 
ago and he was writing music and rap.'

Officials say
the shooter remains armed and dangerous.

As well as the three fatalities, a further five were injured in crash.

British tourist Mark Thompson, who 
was visiting from Manchester said that the scene was something straight 
out of an action movie.

'This doesn't happen where we come from, not on this scale,' he said.

'We get stabbings, and gang violence, but this is like something out of a movie. Like "Die Hard" or something.'
