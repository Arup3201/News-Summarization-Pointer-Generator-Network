Marouane Fellaini wants nothing more to be fully fit and pushing for a place in Manchester United's struggling line-up, but he's certainly not wasting his time while working his way back from injury.

The Beligian midfielder has shown his lighter side in a Twitter post with what he calls a 'new haircut' as he continues his support for the disability charity CAP48.

Fellaini's afro has been fashioned into a more angular version of his usual ball shape, though the style making his trademark curly locks look even more pronounced appears suspiciously like a wig.

The gesture, photographed at an event for the charity and posted on Twitter, is Fellaini's latest act of kindness for the charity based in his homeland. 

The former Everton star has been sponsor for the 55-year-old group since 2011, well before his £27million transfer from the Toffees in August last year. .

'A new haircut to support #cap48. Be "carrement CAP48"!' he posted with a picture of his new 'do.

The post followed this teaser on the social networking site. 'After the training, go to the hairdresser ... See you soon #Newhair #Again #Barbershop #Afro #NewStyle.'

Fellaini celebrates a goal in United's pre-season match against Valencia before his ankle is injured

Fellaini's working his way back from a pre-season ankle with his only competitive appearance this campaign in the season opener, off the bench for Ander Herrera in United's 2-1 loss to Swansea.

Lous van Gaal's side has since won just once, a 4-0 demolition of a below-par QPR before blowing a 3-1 lead to fall 5-3 to Leicester the following week.

Having largely been considered a flop for his new club in a disappointing first season, Fellaini is confident he'll get a chance to prove himself under Van Gaal.

However, the 6ft 4in Belgium star knows he has a host of competition in a side which has splashed £150m on new talent over the summer.

'I talked to Van Gaal, and he has never said that I had to leave,' Fellaini told Sport Wereld.

'He said I had a lot of competition, but that I got the chance to prove it [that I deserve to play].

'I have known difficult moments last season, but there is a stronger player afterwards. I have confidence in myself and in my game again.

'I played a good World Cup and also during the preparation, I was good. It is unfortunate that this injury is for now just a spanner in the works, but at the end of the month I will be back.'

United have a chance to begin the revival of their their Premier League campaign against West Ham at Old Trafford on Saturday.
