Jerry Sandusky's plan to take the witness stand at his trial was foiled after his adopted son came forward and told prosecutors the former Penn State assistant football coach had abused him, it has emerged.

Trial transcripts posted online on Friday reveal that Sandusky was forced to remain silent during his child sex-abuse trial because of concerns over his son's allegations.

'Mr. Sandusky had always wanted to 
testify on his own behalf. He always wanted to tell people his side to 
the allegations in this case,' said defense lawyer Joe Amendola.

'That potential evidence, whether true 
or not, was so devastating' that Sandusky felt he could not run the risk
of testifying and subjecting himself to questions about Matt, he 
continued.

Matt Sandusky, whom the defense had originally planned to call as a witness, abruptly switched sides late in the trial, approaching prosecutors and offering to testify that he too had suffered abuse at the hands of his father, the transcript shows.

Prosecutors planned to call Matt as a rebuttal witness if Sandusky testified in his own defense, the transcript shows.

They later backed off, but wouldn't agree to a defense request to refrain from asking Sandusky about his son's claims on cross examination.

Amendola argued for a mistrial, saying 'it was such an integral part of our case that Mr. Sandusky testify that we feel we have really put ourselves in a tough situation with the jury.'

Prosecutors objected and Judge John Cleland agreed, telling Amendola that trials have a way of throwing legal strategies into disarray.

Matt Sandusky went to live with Sandusky and his wife, Dottie, as a foster child and was adopted by them as an adult.

Shortly after the former coach's arrest in November, Matt Sandusky's ex-wife went to court to keep her former father-in-law away from their three young children. Jill Jones successfully obtained a restraining order forbidding the children from sleeping over at their grandparents' home.

Sandusky was convicted in June of 45 
counts of sex abuse involving 10 boys. Prosecutors said some of the 
assaults took place on the Penn State campus.

The 68-year-old Sandusky, given his 
age and the serious nature of the crimes, is likely to receive a 
sentence that will keep him in prison for life. He is jailed pending 
sentencing and maintains his innocence.

Judge John Cleland has scheduled a morning
hearing at the courthouse in Bellefonte to determine if Sandusky should
be classified as a sexually violent predator, a designation that 
subjects a convict to intense reporting requirements upon release.

An
assessment board has recommended Sandusky for the designation, though 
it's expected to have little practical effect since he stands to die in 
prison.

Sandusky will be 
sentenced immediately after the hearing. The judge ordered defence 
attorneys and prosecutors to submit written statements 'intended to aid 
the court in the imposition of sentence' by October 5.

Sandusky's attorney Joe Amendola said his client might make a statement at the hearing.

'Jerry
remains in relatively good spirits and has spent most of his time in 
custody preparing for his sentencing and his appeal,' Amendola said via 
email.

Attorney Tom Kline, 
representing a young man who testified during Sandusky's trial that he 
was fondled in a school shower in 2001, said Monday he expects his 
client either to testify at sentencing or to supply a statement to the 
court.

'We expect to provide
what is requested by the attorney general's office to assure justice is
achieved in Mr. Sandusky's sentencing,' Kline said in an email.

Attorney general's office spokesman Nils Frederiksen said prosecutors will make a sentencing recommendation to the judge.
