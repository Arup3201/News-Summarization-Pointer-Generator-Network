A mother whose pit bull-type dog savaged an eight-year-old boy leaving him scarred for life has said she is ‘truly sorry’ for the attack.

Emma Gregory, 20, was handed a suspended jail term for allowing her dog, Tia, to maul the boy as he walked home from school with his mother.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was left needing plastic surgery after suffering serious bite injuries to his cheek, arm and leg.

After pleading guilty to having a dog 
that was dangerously out of control at an earlier hearing, Gregory was 
pictured laughing and waving as she left court.

But after receiving a 16-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months and being banned from keeping a dog for five years at Manchester Crown Court, she said she hadn’t intended to make light of the boy’s ordeal.

Gregory, of Openshaw, said: 'I’m truly sorry for the injuries which were caused by Tia and I hope the boy can overcome both the physical and the emotional trauma he suffered.

'I was naive about the dangers of 
owning certain breeds of dogs and I have learnt a lot from this. I hope 
it brings home to other dog owners how big a responsibility it is to 
keep an animal and that certain breeds can be very dangerous.'

David James, defending, said Gregory 
was not aware the dog was classified as a dangerous breed and had never 
experienced trouble before.

The
court heard how she had been seen ‘shooing’ the dog out of her house 
before closing the door behind it. The dog then ran across the street 
towards the boy, jumping on him and knocking him to the ground.

The child’s mother beat the dog with her handbag in a desperate attempt to stop the attack - which lasted for several minutes.

Both Tia and Gregory’s other pit 
bull-type dog, Mia, who have been housed in kennels at a cost of more 
than £3,000 since the attack, will now be put down.

Emma Gregory was photographed on the day of the original court hearing outside her home carrying a large pile of the Manchester Evening News, which had run the story on its front cover.

Judge
Robert Crawford said a compensation order towards the victim was ‘not 
appropriate’ as Gregory is the single mother of an 18-month-old boy and 
lives on benefits. However, the case could still be pursued in the civil
courts.

He added: 'This
was a serious incident which has had lasting consequences for this 
child, who has suffered permanent scarring. It was your duty to make 
sure you didn’t have dogs of this nature.'
