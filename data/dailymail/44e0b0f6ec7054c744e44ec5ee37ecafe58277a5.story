Officers may be better employed tackling current threats than historic crimes and failings, Britain’s top policeman suggested last night.

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe called for a ‘grown up conversation’ about the commitment to investigating decades-old issues.

The Scotland Yard boss said he will ‘never shrink’ from the task of bringing a ‘bad person to justice, whoever they are, without fear or favour’. 

But he added: ‘We have to be better at weighing up the likelihood of success against the risks that those resources might be able to prevent or mitigate in the present day.’

Sir Bernard was speaking in London as a child sex abuse inquiry starts work investigating failings by institutions to protect children. 

The four-person panel will have statutory powers to compel witnesses and victims will also be able to appear as witnesses.

There are concerns that forces are struggling to balance a tidal wave of historic allegations with the danger of present-day criminals.

Hundreds of victims came forward in a phenomenon dubbed the ‘Savile-effect’ after the DJ and entertainer was exposed as a predatory paedophile after his death. 

In his speech, Sir Bernard also said Britain needs fewer pubs and bars in order to tackle the violence linked to binge-drinking culture.

He advocated merging many constabularies to create nine super-forces in a bid to cut costs and bureaucracy.

Sir Bernard said police need to be more open about how they manage the risks they face, including the £50 million spent on 42,000 missing children every year. 

And he said the people should protect themselves from crime in the same way people take steps to ensure they remain in good health.

‘I believe that keeping the public safe should be just as high priority as keeping them healthy, he said. ‘I’d like it to achieve the same high profile that prevention has in health over the last 20 years.’
