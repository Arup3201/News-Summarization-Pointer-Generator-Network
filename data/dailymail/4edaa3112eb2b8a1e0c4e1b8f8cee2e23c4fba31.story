Billy McKinlay is to hold talks with Saudi Arabian club Al Ittihad.

The 45-year-old is keen to step straight back into management after his unceremonious sacking by Watford after just eight days in charge.

Al Ittihad were in discussions with Neil Lennon who instead took over as Bolton manager on Sunday.

McKinlay won one and drew the other of his two games in charge at Vicarage road, lasting just eight days

McKinlay, who won one and drew the other of his two games in charge at Watford, has interest from clubs in England also but Al Ittihad are offering a £30,000 a week salary to their next manager.

Talking of his departure from Watford, McKinlay said: 'I was disappointed. I was surprised to be appointed in the first place. But for it only to last as short as it did was a surprise to say the least.'

McKinlay resigned as assistant Northern Ireland manager to allow him to take up the full-time position at Watford and he may yet return to that role on a part-time basis.
