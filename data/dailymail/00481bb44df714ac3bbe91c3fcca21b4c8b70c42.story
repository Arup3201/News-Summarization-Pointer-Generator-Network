Online: Internet retailer Amazon has made £13.5billion in worldwide sales in just three months - with one tenth of that coming from UK shoppers

High Street stores may be in serious trouble, but their web rival Amazon is booming, as its Christmas sale figures revealed yesterday.

The world's biggest online retailer took in $21.3billion (£13.5billion) over the festive period as customers continued to desert bricks-and-mortar stores in favour of internet shopping.

Amazon's massive Christmas revenues will increase pressure on the web giant to pay more tax in the UK, an issue which has seen it under fire recently.

The firm said that international sales, including the UK, soared 20 per cent to $9.1billion (£5.8billion) in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Total sales were up by 22 per cent, driven above all by the popularity of its tablet computer, the Kindle Fire.

However, net income fell by 45 per cent to $97million (£62million) due to greater investment in Amazon's distribution network and its Kindle range of devices.

The firm boasted that it now offers a selection of 23 million TV shows, songs, magazines, books, audiobooks and apps - up from 19million at the end of 2011.

'We're now seeing the transition we've been expecting,' Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said. 'After five years, electronic books is a multibillion dollar category for us and growing fast - up approximately 70 per cent last year.'

The firm's revenues missed Wall Street's expectations, but investors still sent its stock up more than 10 per cent in after-hours trading.

For the current quarter, Amazon expects revenue of between $15-16.6billion (£9.5-10.5billion).

Hit: Amazon's strong revenues are boosted by sales of its Kindle Fire tablet computer

The company has been under attack for
avoiding millions of pounds in taxes. Critics say this enables the 
company to slash prices and undercut rivals.

An
estimated 17,500 high street jobs are at risk after 1,400 stores closed
down over the Christmas period. And industry experts warn more retail 
failures could see one in five shops boarded up.

Household names including HMV, Jessops, Blockbuster and Comet have all collapsed into administration during the past two months.

Waterstone’s
founder Tim Waterstone previously said Amazon had a ‘rude, 
contemptuous, arrogant and subversive’ attitude to competitors.

And John Lewis boss Andy Street has called for a ‘level playing field’ to stop it ‘out-trading’ rivals.

Amazon was also dubbed ‘immoral’ for avoiding tax by funnelling revenue to Luxembourg.

In
2011, the most recent year where figures are available, Amazon paid 
just £1.8million despite raking in sales of £3.35billion in the UK – a 
figure the firm tried to keep secret until it was exposed by MPs.

In trouble: HMV, which is currently in administration with some 4,500 jobs at risk, was the latest in a long line of entertainment and electronics stores which have collapsed since the financial crash in 2009

‘Amazon
is uniquely positioned to be a disruptive force to the traditional 
retail channel for years to come,’ said analyst RJ Hottovy from US 
brokers Morningstar.

‘Amazon has played a prominent role in the structural shift away
from bricks-and-mortar retail and it may lay waste to several other 
retailers in the years to come.

‘Without the cost burden of physical retail stores, Amazon can price below traditional rivals and drive recurring traffic online.’

Since launching, Amazon has expanded from selling books to include DVDs, CDs, household appliances, garden tools and even car parts.

Sales of cheap CDs and DVDs helped hasten the decline of HMV, which is currently in administration with some 4,500 jobs at risk.

The group was the latest in a long line of entertainment and electronics stores which have collapsed since the financial crash in 2009, including Woolworths – once the UK’s biggest seller of DVDs.

A further 4,190 jobs were endangered when video rental service Blockbuster collapsed earlier this month.

Blockbuster
UK's announcement that it has gone into administration makes it the 
latest in a long line of high-profile high street firms to fail - the 
most visible legacy of the financial crisis and subsequent double-dip 
recession.December 2008: MFI,
the furniture retailer, was one of the first major firms to go out of 
business at the start of the downturn, as retail sales began to fall

shuttered its 800 stores, bringing home to many the scale of the UK's 
economic collapse as the country entered recession for the first timeFebruary 2009: Zavvi stopped trading around Christmas - and refused to honour its gift cards, leading to widespread customer angerBordersDecember 2009: Borders was another entertainment behemoth to go under as sale of CDs and DVDs were squeezed by digital downloads and online retailers

October 2012: JJB Sports
closed all but 20 of its stores, which were taken over and re-branded 
by Sports Direct - leading to the death of the JJB brand and 550 
employees losing their jobs

December 2012: Comet
shut down just before Christmas, leaving nearly 7,000 staff out of work
and forcing the taxpayer to pick up a £50million tab related to its 
bankruptcy, which was blamed on soaring energy prices and a reduction in
the number of home buyersJanuary 2013: Jessops
was closed by administrator PwC earlier this month after years of 
struggling with online competition as customers turned away from 
traditional photographyJanuary 2013: HMV,
which has 239 shops and 4,500 staff, announced that it was calling in 
administrators. The company came under fire for not honouring gift 
vouchers which they had been selling all over Christmas.

January 2013: Blockbuster followed HMV into administration the next day, and immediately announced plans to close a quarter of its branches as it saw its DVD rental business collapse under pressure from online downloads
