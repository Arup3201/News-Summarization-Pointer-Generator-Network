It sounds like the latest gadget from Apple. But ‘iPosture’ is being blamed for an alarming level of  back pain among 18 to 24-year-olds.

The term is being used to describe the stooped body shape adopted by those texting, emailing or playing games on their iPad or smartphone.

Some 84 per cent of those aged 18 to 24 admitted to having suffered back pain in the past year, in a survey by the healthcare provider Simplyhealth.

The study found 84 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds have admitted to suffering back pain in the last 12 months - perhaps because they are spending a large amount of time hunching over tablets and smartphones

This age group now loses more working days a year to back pain than those in their parents’ generation.

Dr
 Brian Hammond, chairman of BackCare, the national back pain charity, 
said: ‘The vast majority of people experience back pain in the lower 
back.

‘Over half the population experience pain in the neck or lower back every year.

‘This survey shows that 18 to 24-year-olds are more likely to experience pain in the upper back and neck.

‘It
 is likely that slumping and hunching over computers and hand-held 
devices is a contributory factor in the different types of back pain 
reported by different generations.

‘Younger
 people are far more likely to be hunched over a device on a sofa, and 
would benefit from paying close attention to the basics of good 
posture.’

The results 
also show that almost all age groups spend as much time in front of a 
computer, laptop or tablet screen in total as they do asleep in bed, 
some even more so.

Excluding
 time spent watching the ‘traditional’ TV, the typical young adult 
spends 8.83 hours a day in front of a screen. The total is 6.64 hours 
for the older generation.

The 18 to 24-year-olds are also much more likely to either slouch or hunch in front of their PC or other devices.

Part
 of that could be down to a lack of old-fashioned advice, because it 
appears that being told to sit up straight seems to be on the decline.

A combination of work and home screen time, excluding traditional TV, means that over 55s spent an average of 6.64 hours a day in front of a computer screen. However this age group are more than twice as likely to sit up straight at home with their PC or laptop in front of them that the younger age group

Nearly
 three-quarters of the older generation recall being given this advice 
from their parents and more than half remember similar admonishments 
from their teachers.

Parents
 today are much less likely to tell their children to sit up and stand 
up straight. Nearly two thirds of those questioned said they never gave 
their children this advice.

Jean
 Broke-Smith, an expert in etiquette and deportment, said: ‘Although it 
has been decades since people learned good posture at finishing schools,
 the time seems right to recognise its potential to help younger people 
avoid the risk of back pain associated with increasing use of hand-held 
devices.

‘Being aware you are slouching or hunching over your tablet or smartphone is half the battle.

‘The
 other half is to counter this bad habit and the potential pain it can 
generate by always sitting up with a straight back with your device in a
 comfortable position at a reasonable height in front of you.’

Over half the population experience pain in the neck or lower back every year. The study results also show almost all age groups spend as much time in front of a PC, laptop or tablet screen in total as they do asleep in bed, some even more so

Motion sickness caused by smartphones, 3D films and computer games could become a curse of the 21st century.

A variation called simulation sickness is on the rise as gadgets become better and better at mimicking reality.

Up to 90 per cent of people could be affected, according to technology website Quartz.

Motion sickness is usually triggered when we feel movement  but cannot see it. Simulation sickness, is the opposite – we see movement that the body cannot feel.

It is being felt by iPhone owners using its new operating system, which makes the screen appear more 3D.

Google Glass spectacles, which flash images into the wearer’s field of vision, are expected to exacerbate the phenomenon.
