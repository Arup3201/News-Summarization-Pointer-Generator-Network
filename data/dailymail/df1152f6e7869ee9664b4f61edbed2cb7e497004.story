Arsenal usually spread around the goals and the glory. They had hit the net 76 times this campaign but now, in their biggest game of the season, they drew a blank until injury-time.

While Arsenal’s strikeforce do not have the class of Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, they should still have been good for more than Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s late goal against Monaco.

At times Olivier Giroud, usually so reliable, Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil, Danny Welbeck and the deeper-lying Santi Cazorla looked like they had never played together.

Here at the Emirates Stadium, the five figures Arsene Wenger turned to in this first leg failed him. Miserably, as it turned out, because his former club Monaco romped to a 3-1 victory.

Despite Giroud’s catastrophic miss in the second half, when he skied a shot into the stands after Danijel Subasic had failed to hold Sanchez’s shot, there was something wrong about the reaction when he was substituted.

Arsenal were 2-0 down by the time Giroud was replaced by Theo Walcott in the 62nd minute. He left to howls of derision from home supporters. Giroud, who has been leading the line brilliantly of late, did not deserve that.

This Monaco side are the clean-sheet kings, with five in their six Champions League group games against Bayer Leverkusen, Zenit St Petersburg and Benfica. They are a resilient bunch

The first cries of ‘Come on Arsenal, come on Arsenal’ came after half an hour, betraying frustration that the forward line had hit a brick wall.

They had Tomas Rosicky, Walcott and Oxlade-Chamberlain sitting on the bench. Something had to change.

In-form Santi Cazorla had a relatively quiet game in comparison to his recent displays for the Gunners

Last weekend, when Arsenal went to Crystal Palace and won 2-1, they kept plenty in reserve by boxing clever. Here they lacked any punch, with the killer instinct deserting them after Monaco had taken a surprise lead through Geoffrey Kondogbia’s deflected strike. 

Arsenal struggled to find their rhythm, blocked by the powerful presence of Wallace, who might have given away a penalty when he appeared to handle, and Aymen Abdennour.

It is rare for this Gunners team to look around for answers but they lacked conviction, returning to the bad old days when they believed they could walk the ball into the net.

Sometimes Sanchez wants it too much, as he did on Saturday when he was taken out of his comfort zone in the victory over Palace.

The Chilean has been desperate to get things going again, to hit another purple patch like the one which saw him score in successive games against Hull, Burnley, Anderlecht and Swansea in the autumn.

Sanchez was electric then, the spark in this Arsenal team while they waited for the return of Ozil from his injury lay-off.

There were chances to make an impression in the first half, but Arsenal lacked the expression that they have shown during their recent run of good form.

Giroud hit a couple of chances high and wide in the opening 45 minutes and it is fair to say that much more was expected of the man up top.

Ozil produced some lovely touches, including a cushioned lay-off into the path of Hector Bellerin as he made his way into the penalty area. For some reason, referee Deniz Aytekin penalised the full back for a foul.

Walcott offered an alternative when he came on, forcing a save from Subasic that fell at the feet of Welbeck. His follow-up shot struck Walcott and flew over.

Wenger gambled, sending for Oxlade-Chamberlain to replace Francis Coquelin with 22 minutes left. He provided a goal, only for Arsenal to blow it again. Big time.
