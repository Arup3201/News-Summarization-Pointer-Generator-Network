Teachers and healthcare professionals who fail to report suspected female genital mutilation in children will face the sack, under a new law expected to come into effect this year.

Doctors, nurses and teachers would be obliged to report cases of FGM in under -18s or risk being fired and barred from practising, according to the proposed legislation.  

Today's announcement comes after the Government unveiled a raft of measures to crack down on the practice, including the creation of a new specialist FGM Unit which will go into affected communities.

Prime Minister David Cameron announced his intention to introduce mandatory reporting at last year's Girl Summit, attended by Hollywood actress and UN envoy Angelina Jolie.

The new law will be fast-tracked through Parliament and is expected hit the statute books before the general election in May.

Crime Prevention Minister Lynne Featherstone said: 'FGM is a criminal offence and it is child abuse. It can cause extreme and lifelong physical and emotional suffering and we all have a responsibility to do all we can to put a stop to it.

'We believe that introducing a mandatory duty will provide clarity for professionals and will give them the confidence to confront FGM. It will aid police investigations and increase the number of perpetrators caught and prosecuted.

'It will also send a clear message to perpetrators that they will be held responsible for their actions and help prevent this appalling crime from happening.'

The new law will apply in all cases of known FGM in under 18s, whether it is either disclosed by the victim or seen by the professional.

It means all teachers and regulated health and social care professionals will have to report the FGM to police within one month.

If they fail to do so they will face internal disciplinary measures or be referred to their professional organisation, which has the power to bar them from practice.

Ministers stressed that not all reports of FGM will trigger arrests, and police may launch a safeguarding response instead.

It has been estimated that more than  20,000 girls under the age of 15 are at risk of female genital mutilation in the UK each year.

It is believed that 130,000 women living in Britain have been subjected to FGM, which can cause infection, problems in childbirth and death.

It is believed that these figures are much higher, but due to the hidden nature of the crime, the true extent of FGM is unknown. 

FGM is prevalent in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, mainly in rural communities.

In the UK and tends to occur in areas with larger populations of communities who practise FGM, such as first-generation immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers.

These areas include London, Cardiff, Manchester, Sheffield, Northampton, Birmingham, Oxford, Crawley, Reading, Slough and Milton Keynes.

The practice has been illegal in Britain since 1985, but no one has ever been successfully prosecuted for it.

NHS doctor Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, stood trial for FGM last month, but was acquitted in less than 30 minutes amid claims the Crown Prosecution Service had brought the case because of political pressure to secure a conviction. 

The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 makes it illegal to participate in any sort of arrangement for FGM to be performed on another, either inside or outside the UK. 

Those who are involved in any way - be it aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring or carrying out FGM inside or outside the UK can face 14 years imprisonment.  

Young victims of FGM are often taken abroad during the school holidays, with the wounds healing before they return to the UK.

The procedure is carried out for cultural, religious and social reasons within families and communities and it is often considered a necessary part of raising a girl properly, and motivated by the belief that it is beneficial for the girl or woman.

The procedure is traditionally carried out by an older woman in the community, who often has no medical training. 

Often, anaesthetics and antiseptics are not used and the cutting usually takes place with basic tools including knives, scissors and even razor blades. 

There is a high risk of infection and damage to the genitals as well as long-term effects both physically and psychologically.
