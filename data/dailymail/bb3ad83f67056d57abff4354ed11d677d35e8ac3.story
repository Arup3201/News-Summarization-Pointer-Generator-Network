Mercedes will consider a new driver line-up if Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg are involved in another collision.

Hamilton was forced to retire from the Belgium Grand Prix after his controversial crash with team-mate Rosberg in Spa.

Rosberg finished second despite damaging his front wing in the impact, but was subsequently booed on the podium, and then hit with a six-figure fine by Mercedes for admitting his fault in the collision.

Both he and Hamilton have been told they are allowed to race freely for the remainder of the campaign, but were warned about their future conduct at a crunch meeting at Mercedes’ HQ in Brackley last Friday.

‘We have made it very clear this is an unacceptable scenario for us, actually for both of them,’ Toto Wolff said in an interview with BBC Radio Five Live.

‘We don't want this to happen ever again and the consequences are very easy.

‘If we are not able to manage the two of them following the Mercedes Benz racing spirit then we need to admit that and take decisions and take consequences of having a different line-up probably.’

Fury: Toto Wolff was incandescent after Rosberg's collision with Hamilton. He described it as 'unacceptable'
