Roy Hodgson insists the Football Association would jump at the chance to involve David Beckham in the England set-up.

The 39-year-old former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder told several national newspapers earlier this week that he would be proud to have a role with England in the future.

And now Three Lions boss Hodgson has given his approval for Beckham to assist the national team in some capacity.

'Someone of David's stature, with his qualities and personality, I'm 100 per cent certain if he can find the time to lend his presence to the FA they would be happy to find role for him,' Hodgson told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme.

'If he could make himself available for England in some way or another I have no doubt in my mind that (FA chairman) Greg Dyke and (FA general secretary) Alex Horne would welcome his presence within an England capacity.'

Beckham earned his 115th and final England cap in 2009 and his only duties with the national team off the pitch since were when he served as a 'player liaison' as part of then manager Fabio Capello's backroom staff at the 2010 World Cup after injury ruled him out of the tournament.

Beckham retired from football in the summer of 2013 was not asked to be part of Dyke's England Commission which was launched in September of that year.

Earlier this year, he announced plans to launch a new Miami-based Major League Soccer franchise.
