Asylum seekers in Calais have threatened to burn themselves alive if they are not let into Britain.

The 25 refugees have vowed to make desperate and horrific gesture in the town’s main shopping street unless the French and British governments meet a list of demands.

They are among 35 asylum seekers who have been on hunger strike since June 12 in a protest camp near the main ferry port.

They are demanding that refugees who want to cross the Channel are given legal status in Britain, and those that wish to remain in France are granted legal status there.

And they are asking for safe accommodation and an end to police brutality in Calais until a deal between the UK and France on their fate is reached.

One 40-year-old Afghan asylum seeker named John Abdullah told French media: 'We are tired of life. We want human rights. We want the British and French governments to think about us, but nobody cares.

'We no longer want to live like animals': Migrants have sent a letter to Denis Robin, Prefect of Pas-de-Calais, demanding proper accommodation

'All 25 of us have decided that if 
they do not listen, we will kill ourselves. We will go to the high 
street, throw petrol and set ourselves on fire.'

The protesters are among the 300 or so migrants whose camp site made of cardboard and bin bags was bulldozed last month by police amid claims it was infested with scabies.

Since then, many of them have been sleeping in the meal distribution centre in Calais.

In a joint letter to Calais prefect Denis Robin this month, they wrote: 'We no longer want to live like animals, but as normal human beings in dignified conditions, whether or not we have identity papers.

'We want roofs over our heads, decent hygiene conditions, three meals a day and an end to police controls, while talks resume between the UK and France regarding our final destination.'

Calais migrant aid worker Cecile Bossy said: 'Everyone wants to find a solution to this extremely complex problem.

'Right now, the main issue is finding them somewhere they can be sheltered.'

Calais police have said they are working with local aid organisations to monitor the ongoing hunger strike and the threat by the 25 to set themselves on fire.

A Calais police spokesman said: 'We absolutely can not let them burn themselves alive. We are doing everything in our power to prevent this from ever happening.'

Police: Gendarmes search the shelters of asylum seekers in their camp at Calais last month, shortly before bringing in bulldozers to flatten the camps amid claims that the camp was the centre of an outbreak of scabies

Large numbers of migrants have been living rough in Calais since the Sangatte hostel was bulldozed in 2002.

There are believed to be around 1,000 refugees currently along the northern French coast, with around 650 near the port where they try to sneak aboard ferries and lorries bound for Dover.

Since police bulldozed their camp last month, many have also moved to smaller ports in Normandy and Brittany in their attempts to reach Britain.

Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart recently blamed the UK’s ‘generous’ state benefits for refugees for the camps in her town.

She said: 'Calais is a hostage to the British. That’s enough. It’s no longer tenable. It’s necessary to renegotiate these accords. We’re not here to do their job.'
