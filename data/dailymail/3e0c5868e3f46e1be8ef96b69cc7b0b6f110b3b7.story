These photos capture the heart-stopping moment two female tigers savagely slash and tear at each during a ferocious battle over territory.

The majestic photos were taken by Ukrainian wildlife photographer Alex Kirichko - who was just metres away when he witnessed it.

The intense altercation erupted when the smallest of the pair, the orange coloured tiger known as Shadow, attempted to expand her hunting ground in a South African game reserve.

Ferocious: The formidable-looking pair of female tigers were captured leaping wildly at one another during the altercation in South Africa

The white Siberian tiger, called Tibo, was clearly unwilling to give up the area and was seen leaping wildly at her opponent - appearing to get the better of her.

After being overpowered, Shadow is seen rolling in the sandy Savannah grass before making a hasty retreat.

Photographer Mr Kirichko, 49, was sat in his jeep a mere ten metres from the spectacle.

He said: 'The two tigers were fighting over territory that day - Tibo was the defender and Shadow was the intruder.

Rare sight: Witnessing a fight such as this is extremely rare and photographer Alex Kirichko was able to capture it from just ten metres away

'It was a vicious fight but, Tibo, the biggest of the pair managed to win. Shadow ended up on the ground while Tibo was circling her - she was clearly in control.

'The sound was incredible, if you've ever heard cats fight you know they can be loud but these cats weighed around 28 stone.

'It happened right before eyes, I'd say only ten metres away from our position. I was just glad to be inside the safety of a vehicle.'

The scenes were captured in South Africa's 'Tiger Canyons' a unique private game reserve that allows visitors to see the endangered species out in the wild.

The tiger is the largest cat species in the world, reaching a maximum body length of up to 11ft and weighing up to 390kg.
