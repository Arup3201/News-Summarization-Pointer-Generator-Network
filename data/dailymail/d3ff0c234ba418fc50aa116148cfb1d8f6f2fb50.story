Arrested: Emery Jenkins, 38, told police that he dropped Joseph in the bath, knocking his head, a week earlier and that he had also fallen from a swing that same week

A father with a history of domestic abuse has been arrested on suspicion of killing his two-month-old son who was found beaten to death with bite marks covering his body.

Emery Jenkins, who turns 38 today, was arrested after the lifeless body of his son, Joseph, was found at the family home in Deer River, Minnesota on October 16.

Paramedics performed CPR on the child in a desperate bid to save his life but to no avail. 

He was taken to a Deer River hospital and then airlifted to St. Marys Hospital in Duluth where he died the following day. 

The doctor who treated him described his cause of death as a 'blunt force trauma', consistent with beating. 

He said the youngster suffered a skull fracture and broken ribs as well as what appeared to be bite marks on his chest, hands and feet.

Jenkins told police that he dropped Joseph in the bath, knocking his head, a week earlier and that he had also fallen from a swing that same week. 

He explained the marks by saying a neighbour's dog had bitten him as an infant while strapped into a car seat.

The child's mother, however, told authorities that Jenkins in fact bit the baby multiple times because he was crying. 

Jenkins wouldn’t allow the baby to go to a scheduled medical appointment because he did not want anyone to see the injuries, the complaint said.

She also said they made up the story about the neighbor’s dog biting the baby.

Court records showed that Jenkins has a history of domestic-related violence in Minnesota from 1995 to 2010.

He has been convicted three times of domestic assault, once of violating a protection order, twice for other assaults, three times for disorderly conduct and once for drink driving.

If convicted, Jenkins could spend forty years behind bars of convicted of murder.
