The Chicago Bears have suspended and fined Martellus Bennett after he slammed rookie cornerback Kyle Fuller into the turf in training camp.

Bennett reacted furiously to Fuller's high hit after he attempted to strip the ball, rearing up and piledriving the 22-year-old.

The veteran tight end had to be restrained by several team-mates, among them wide receiver Brandon Marshall.

Head coach Marc Trestman cut the practice ten minutes short to try to take the heat out of the situation.

'I come to training camp for one reason and that's to prepare to win a championship,' Bennett said.

'I play hard and go hard every single day. I'm probably one of the most violent people on the field. That's just my style of play. I'm going to continue to play the same way I always play. That's what I'm here for.

'Everybody talks about friendships, but really we are all preparing to win a championship. If we make friends along the way, cool. But I'm just trying to help the Bears win a championship and do the job to the best of my ability.

Prize asset: Big things are expected of Kyle Fuller

'It's practice. Practice is practice. I know I sound like Allen Iverson right now, but it's practice. (Expletive) happens at practice. You learn from it. That's why it's practice,' he told ESPN. 

General manager Phil Emery announced that Bennett has been fined and suspended 'for conduct detrimental to the team'. 

Team-mates and coaches have noted Bennett's lackadaisical attitude to training, with his poor work ethic regularly slowing down the tempo, according to the Chicago Tribune.

After joining from the New York Giants last season on a $20.4million four-year deal, the veteran contributed to the NFC's highest scoring offense, and the second-highest scoring in Bears history.

Facing over 90% of snaps, he caught 65 passes for 679 yards and five touchdowns.

Big things are expected of Fuller, who was taken at No 14 in May's draft, and is expected to start in the nickel package alongside veterans Charles Tillman and Tim Jennings.

The Bears, who have not made the playoffs since 2010, begin their season when the Buffalo Bills travel to Soldier Field on September 7.
