Terror group Al-Qaeda are furious that Malala Yousafzai - who was shot in the head in a botched Taliban assassination - is being hailed a heroine around the world, it was reported last night.

Would-be killers were sent to shoot the girl, 15, because she has campaigned for womens' rights and educating girls in the Swat Valley area of Pakistan, which was under complete Taliban control from 2007 to 2009.

But their attempt to re-assert power backfired: First by failing to kill brave Malala, and then by sparking protests across Pakistan in support of the schoolgirl.

Sunni clerics in the country even issued a fatwa against the Taliban, decrying an attack on a girl as un-Islamic.

But Al-Qaeda member Ustad Ahmad Farooq compared the attack on Western military operations, saying in a letter: 'Nobody spoke up for thousands of such Malalas who became victims of military operations, and nobody protested for them on the roads,’ reported Fox News.

He added: ‘But these circles made so much noise when we targeted this girl who made fun of jihad, the veil and other Islamic values on behest of the British Broadcasting Corporation.

‘This attack created shockwaves in the ruling circles around the world. They issued a number of statements condemning the attack on Malala.

‘I may ask why? Why is Malala's blood more important than those killed by the army?’

Dr Dave Rosser, medical director at 
University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, said Malala will 
need a significant period of rest and recuperation before she has 
reconstructive surgery.

Malala, who cannot speak at the moment, was in a medically induced coma on arrival in Britain last Monday, but has since regained consciousness and has stood for the first time since the shooting.

The girl, who has won various peace prizes, was on her way back home on a school bus in the Swat Valley in north-west Pakistan when masked men boarded the vehicle and pointed guns at the girls.

A hooded Taliban militant shouted: 'Which one of you is Malala? Speak up, otherwise I will shoot you all. She is propagating against the soldiers of Allah, the Taliban. She must be punished.'

Almost as soon as he shouted this, the militant recognised the youngster and shot her at point blank range. She was shot in the head and neck in the 'barbaric attack'.

She was struck just above the back of her
left eye, with the bullet travelling down the side of her jaw and 
damaging the skull. It went through her neck and lodged in the tissue 
above her shoulder blade.
