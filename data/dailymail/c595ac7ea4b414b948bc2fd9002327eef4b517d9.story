Who said cats and dogs can't get on together?

A video posted by professional animal trainer Robert Dollwet shows the a group of 11 different breeds of canine and their one feline friend right at home in the water, as they head for a day of adventure on a Gold Coast beach in Queensland, Australia.

Titled Happy Dogs In Australia, the hilarious montage was posted on YouTube last Thursday and has gone viral, with more than three million views in a week.

At home on water: Didga the cat showed off one of her many skills when she hit the water on a surfboard with a pack of well-trained dogs

Making a splash: The group of dogs could barley contain its excitement at hitting the waves

It starts with the excited animals eagerly wagging their tails as they are let out of a house and backyard into a van ahead of their impending day of fun.

With Mr Dowllet boasting more than 33 years of animal training experience, the video shows off the animal's exceptional obedience, showing them sitting in perfect lines on the beach and park locations.

Once given the command to move, the animals make a bolt for it, charging straight for the sand and water.

On the beach, they enjoy running along the beach and getting their paws wet in the ocean.

Viral: The video was posted on the internet by professional animal trainer Robert Dollwet on May 1 and has had more than 3 million views

The three-minute video is set to US singer Pharrell Williams' hit song Happy

Playing with a ball and stick, the nearly three-minute video is set to Pharrell Williams' smash hit single Happy.

It quickly becomes apparent the real star of the video is a female cat named Didga. Set to the lyrics of the song, it appears she is lip-syncing part of the vocals.

Proving she is leader of the pack, as the dogs hit the water and are seen dog paddling and walking in shallow water, Didga opts for riding the waves on a surfboard.

Contrary to belief that cats and dogs cannot get along, Didga and her canine friends enjoy mucking about together

Sitting proudly as she wears a safety life jacket on the surfboard, Didga proves she can keep up with the dogs, showing off her swimming skills as she joins the pack for a swim in the water.

This gives some of the dogs a chance to have a go on the board, with two dogs seen riding the board.

As the video concludes, the animals are seen jumping through waves as their fun in the sun draws to an end before hitting the showers to wash off the salt. There are also some glimpses of the dogs in a swimming pool.

Mr Dowlett regularly posts behavioural tutorials on YouTube, where Didga is featured predominately, completing daring stunts including skateboards.

'I frequently hear "You can't train a cat, cats train you!",' Mr Dowlett posted on his YouTube channel.

'I'm here to show you just how smart and teachable cats are using a specific positive methodology similar to the way marine animals are taught.'

Mr Dowlett shows people step-by-step how to teach their cats to walk on a leash, how to stop behavioural issues, some tricks and even how to train them into using a human toilet.

On Thursday, on his CATMANTOO Facebook page, Mr Dowlett wrote that he was dumbfounded by the popularity of the video.

'Three million hits plus,' he wrote. 'I'm blown away by the amount of people who have made such positive comments.Â

Mr Dowlett said cats are teachable animals and can be trained to perform skills and tricks including using a human toilet

Mr Dowlett thanked everyone 'for the likes, shares and comments', which made the video a viral hit

'Honestly I was thinking I'd get around 35,000 hits, and if it went to 100,000 I'd be stoked

'I'd say my calculations were a bit off. The Happy song is as popular as ever and Didga, well, I should never underestimate her talents again.

'Thanks everyone for the likes, shares and comments, really appreciate them all. Robert and Didga p.s. all the happy dogs were great too,' he finished.

The video has also been featured on Good Morning America.
