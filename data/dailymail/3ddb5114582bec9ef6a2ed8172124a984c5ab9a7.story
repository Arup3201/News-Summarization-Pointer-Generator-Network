A computer expert today told how a row over drinks during a first date led to him being arrested and left him with a £1,200 legal bill.

Kishore Nimmala, 32, says he has put off dating for life after arguing with his date over who should pay for the next round of drinks.

Yesterday a jury at Southwark Crown Court took just 53 minutes to clear him of theft, accepting his claim that he took his date's phone in anger but never intended to keep the device.

But despite his victory Mr Nimmala says he has been left traumatised by experience and struggling to pay a huge bill for defending himself.

He says he has not been on a date since February after being left emotionally scarred by his experience.

He told the Evening Standard: 'I’m just very happy to be cleared.

'But it’s not just the money I have been struggling mentally for the last seven months.

'I could have lost everything had I been convicted. I feel like I never want to go on a date again.

'I don’t think you can get the right person online. You don’t know who you are talking to, I mean, I ended up in court.'

He added: 'She said we would drink and dance all night, but she wanted me to pay for everything and I didn’t have enough cash to buy more drinks so she got upset.

'We had a heated argument. She took my money, I took her phone, but I never wanted to steal her phone and keep it.

'I just did it to get her attention and to get some money back.

'Then she started screaming very loudly, so I panicked and I ran (with the phone) for a few metres.

'When I turned back, the police were there and they arrested me.'

Mr Nimmala arranged to go on a date with Fakhara Sultana in February this year after the pair met on dating website Zoosk.

They met at Ruby Blue Bar in Leicester Square where he spent £54 buying two rounds of drinks.

But when he suggested that she get the next set, Miss Sultana informed him that she did not have any money with her because she had expected him to pay. '

The furious row led to the date being cut short and Miss Sultana walking to Charing Cross tube station pursued by Mr Nimmala demanding cash.

He then took her Blackberry mobile out of her hands to get her 'attention' because she became hysterical and he admitted in court that he then panicked and ran.

Two police officers, who were on Charing
Cross Road, joined the chase and caught up with him on St Martin’s 
Lane before they witnessed him throw the phone away.

They then arrested him and charged him with theft.

Speaking during the three-day trial Helen Thomas, prosecuting, previously told the court: 'This case is about a first date that goes badly wrong.

'Ms
Sultana informed to defendant that she didn’t have any money with her 
and that she had assumed that he would be paying for the evening.

'At that point the defendant became angry and so their evening together came to an abrupt close.
