The family of Whitney Heichel, the 21-year-old Starbucks barista who disappeared on her way to work Tuesday, released statement Saturday night thanking police and volunteers for their help during this difficult time.

'We are profoundly devastated by the loss of Whitney Heichel. She was a loved and valued member of our faith.  No words can express the pain and agony her family and friends are undergoing as we cope with the bewildering loss of Whitney. We will continue to support and help one another in this time of grief,' they said in the statement.

Whitney, who was first reported missing by her husband, was an active member of the Jehovah's Witness community in Oregon and her family is now relying on their religious values for support.

'Whitney’s family, friends, and members of our faith draw strength from our God, and his words of comfort found in the bible. The outpouring of support from members of our faith has been such an aid in helping us to deal with the pain and loss of such a wonderful person. For us, this is not a surprise, because this is “what we do” as an organization,' they said in the statement.

'Whitney’s mom expressed that if she could she would “give a big hug to every single person involved in assisting and supporting the family to find Whitney.” Whitney’s husband was equally moved by all the support shown to him and his family. He said “I cannot believe the love and support shown by police, media the business community and people in general. Words cannot express my heartfelt gratitude.'

The body of Heichel, 21, was found on Larch Mountain, a remote forested area east of Gresham, Police Chief Craig Junginger told a news conference. Whitney's 24-year-old neighbour Jonathan Holtwas arrested over the killing.

After collecting DNA and fingerprints and conducting three interviews over several days, police arrested Holt, who lived in the same apartment complex as Heichel and her husband.

Holt, who knew Heichel and her husband, was arrested after police found inconsistencies in the stories that he told investigators over the course of two interviews.

Police said he is also tied to the crime by DNA evidence -- though they would not elaborate.

A motive for the horrific crime in unknown. Police did not comment on whether they have a theory of what led to the killing.

The Starbucks barista reportedly left
her apartment for work at about 6.45am on Tuesday on a drive that 
typically takes less than five minutes.

Her husband, Clint, called police 
roughly three hours later. He told investigators he tried to reach 
Heichel multiple times after her boss alerted him that she never arrived
for her 7am shift.

Police said Heichel's ATM card was 
used at a nearby Troutdale gas station at 9.14am on Tuesday. Two hours 
later, her sport utility vehicle was found in a Wal-Mart parking lot 
with the passenger side window smashed.

A child later found her cell phone in
a field that lies between the gas station and the Wal-Mart, giving 
investigators another venue to search.

Jim Vaughn, a family spokesman, spoke at the Friday night news conference, thanking police for their commitment in the case.

'Really, words can't begin to express the sadness that our families are experiencing tonight,' Vaughn said.

He asked for privacy for the family. Police took no questions.

At a press conference on Thursday, Heichel's husband sobbed uncontrollably and was hardly able to utter a word 
as the missing woman’s mother begged for her daughter's safe return.

'It hurts to breathe right now,' Lorilei Ritmiller told reporters while
speaking of 21-year-old Whitney Heichel. 'But we just want to find her 
and we're not going to stop.'

Heichel
was reported missing by her husband, Clint Heichel, after she failed to
show for her 7am shift at a Starbucks in the Portland suburb of 
Gresham.

Just hours after Thursday’s emotional 
press conference, children playing in an apartment complex several miles
away from Heichel’s home found what is believed to be the missing 
woman’s cell phone.

Parents of one of the children told 
KATU that the device was spotted in bushes outside the Troutdale Terrace
Apartments on Thursday evening. The family said the phone had a 
screensaver of a picture of Heichel and text messages from her relatives
asking if she was okay.

'I was pretty shocked. I mean I knew right away ... I recognized the face,' April Fletcher, the mother of one the girls, told ABC News.

The
apartment complex is about four miles away from Heichel's home in 
Gresham.

Gresham police said at the press conference on Thursday that they had interviewed the Troutdale gas station attendant where Heichel's ATM card was used at 9.14 am, examined surveillance video and canvassed the neighborhood where Heichel lives.

Lt. Claudio Grandjean declined to say if Heichel was seen after 7am, or to say who may have been driving her SUV.

Desperate plea: While Clint Heichel, left, was too overcome with emotion to speak to reporters, her mother, right, begged for the 21-year-old's safe return before her remains were found on Friday

Police said they recovered potential 
evidence during searches of Dodge Park and Larch Mountain, remote, 
forested places east of Gresham where they believe the SUV was on Tuesday 
morning.

'There has been 
property recovered at different locations, but we can't positively say 
that that property is related to this,' Chief Junginger 
said.

Ritmiller said her 
daughter's nickname within the family is 'Mama,' because she's always 
been like a second mother to everybody, including her six siblings.

Ritmiller
added that her daughter was a hard worker, a devoted Jehovah's Witness 
with a 'heart as big as the sun,' and her greatest hope was to have 
children of her own.

'She's wanted to be a mama since she was two years old and I brought her sister home,' she said. 'That was just her biggest hope, to have babies.'

Grandjean said police received 25 phone tips on Wednesday and another 21 that night. Two dozen detectives were assigned to the case that had been classified as a suspicious disappearance.

Though he acknowledged that the first 48 hours are very important in a missing-person case, he stressed that the case is far from cold.

'The leads and the evidence we've 
gathered have not gone cold, and so we continue to push forward until we
find Whitney,' he on Thursday.

Friends
said that a gas station attendant claimed that Heichel's vehicle, which was found with the window smashed in, had been driven 
by a man, who was acting 'suspicious and hurried', as Heichel sat in the
passenger seat.

Her husband, Clint Heichel, told Fox 12 that he learned of his wife's disappearance when her manager at Starbucks called to say she had not arrived for her shift.

'She got dressed this morning, normal everything. Kissed me goodbye, said goodbye,' he said on Tuesday.

'(At)
about 8:15 her boss called me and said, "Hey, I was just curious, did 
Whitney decide to be sick or not feeling well? Have you seen her or 
talked to her?"' he told KATU.

Mr Heichel tried calling and texting her, but she did not respond.

Targeted: Police confirmed that her SUV was seen at a gas station before the vehicle was found in a car park

Worried, he drove to her parents' home 
and then to a hospital in the area, as well as calling family and 
friends to see if anyone knew of her whereabouts.

When they could provide no further 
information, he called police to report her missing at 9.56am, and 
friends and family began distributing flyers and searching for her.

Detectives learned that her vehicle, a black 1999 Ford Explorer, was seen and her ATM card was used at a gas station around four miles from her home at 9.14am.

Her
missing poster claimed an attendant said the man driving the car bought a small amount of gas, but police could not confirm this.

At 1pm, family and friends looking for
Heichel found her vehicle, with the passenger window smashed, at a Walmart in Wood Village.

Details: Family and friends had been handing out flyers in the area in the hopes of gathering information before her body was found

It appeared as if someone had rummaged through the car, according to her missing poster.

'The passenger side window was busted
out, the backseats were down, there was mud on her tires, which it 
wasn't that way the night before,' Clint Heichel said.

'It just is weird that we found her truck, completely off the path that she would take to go to work.'

He added: 'Anyone who has a loved one or is 
married knows if your spouse goes missing and there's no word... I don't 
know what to say, I don't know what to think, I don't know what to do.'

In their investigation, Gresham police looked at surveillance
video showing the SUV at the gas station, but said the video was poor quality and detectives were unable to see who was driving the car.

Family and friends conducted an extensive search for the young woman, including setting up Facebook groups.
