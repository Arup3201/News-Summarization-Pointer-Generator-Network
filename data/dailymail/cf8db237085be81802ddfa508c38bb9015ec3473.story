A young Canadian woman is suing a force for $400,000 after an officer left her handcuffed in the back of a police car with a repeat sex offender - who then assaulted her.

The woman, who was 17 at the time, says she has suffered from post-traumatic stress after the attack in northern Quebec in September 2011.

The incident occurred in Tasiujaq, a tiny Inuit lakeside community that is only accessible by airplane, snowmobile or boat.

The lawsuit alleges 'a serious lack of professionalism and gross negligence' by the Kativik regional police, Cbc reported.

It also claims the officer's actions 'show an incredible lack of concern for the safety of the plaintiff'.

The suit names the officer involved as well as the local police service and the regional government.

Police had been called to remove the woman, who had been drinking, from a residence. 

She was put in the back of a police car in handcuffs with a man - Joe Kritik - who had been convicted of four sexual assaults at the time and was listed on the sexual offenders registry. He was not handcuffed.

Kritik had been arrested earlier for causing a disturbance, according to civil lawsuit documents filed at Quebec Superior Court.

The officer responsible had been on the job less than a month and was not authorized to carry a handgun.

She left the two in the back of the vehicle while getting details about the young woman from the complainant.

According to court documents, the officer returned to the car to find Kritik on top of the woman with his pants down. The officer then pulled Kritik off the woman. 

'The plaintiff was unable to defend herself, being handcuffed in her back and unable to leave the vehicle, the doors being locked,' the lawsuit alleges.

Both the young woman and Kritik were taken to the police station and put in different cells.

The lawsuit also alleges the same officer, who was the only one on duty at the time, slammed the cell door in the woman’s face, breaking her tooth. 

No rape kit was performed and the woman’s parents were not contacted.

The young woman testified in court that she was sexually assaulted. Kritik eventually pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault and was sentenced to 39 months in jail.

The officer involved in the incident was suspended and later resigned.

An internal investigation by the Kativik regional police force cleared her of any criminal wrongdoing.

The Kativik regional government and the police force have not commented on the events, citing the ongoing court case.
