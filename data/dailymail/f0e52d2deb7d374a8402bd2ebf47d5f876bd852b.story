Lost in the snow: Julie Abrahamsen, 20, was in the wilderness for three days - but survived

A snowboarder who vanished into icy backcountry and was lost for three days and nights has been found alive.

Julie Abrahamsen, 20, set off for a day on the slopes at Whistler resort in Canada on Wednesday - but got lost after heading off-piste, and was gone for two nights before the alarm was raised.

Abrahamsen, who is from Norway, hadn't told her roommates when to expect her back, so neither they nor her family in Europe realized anything was amiss until days had passed.

On Friday, police, dog teams and a rescue helicopter scrambled to comb the snow-covered mountainside where they feared she had been stranded. 

She was found more than a mile away from the limits of the resort after a rescue pilot spotted her footprints through thick fog, Canada's Global News reported.

Thanks to mild conditions, which had seen temperatures higher than 40 degrees, Abrahamsen had been able to survive the nights, even though the fog and rain made her harder to track down.

Her last known location had been 11am at the top of the Glacier Express chairlift in Whistler's Blackcomb resort.

Rescuers said she was soaked to the skin when they found her, and had apparently tried swimming across a part-melted creek in the hope of finding help. She was more than two days' walking from the nearest roads.

Rescue experts said that had the temperatures been more typical of the high-altitude ski resort, she could easily have died. They also said her Nordic heritage may have helped her survive the cold.

Rescued: Abrahamsen is pictured above on Saturday getting off the helicopter that saved her. Rescuers say she was soaked through, but otherwise apparently unharmed

Two day gap: Abrahamsen's roommates did not realize anything was amiss until Friday - by which time she had been gone two days already

Abrahamsen's condition was not immediately clear, but she was able to walk a few paces to be loaded onto an ambulance from her rescue chopper.

Global News reported that she is believed to have been discharged Saturday night, and she has since been pictured by friends on social media in her apartment.

Brad Sills, of Whistler's Search and Rescue team, said of her survival: 'It’s not just three normal days. It’s three days of extremely inclement weather... To find somebody with a strong spirit that’s able to endure that past three night’s weather, that’s a big win for all of us'.

Abrahamsen's father, Knut Peder, said he and his family feared the worst.

He revealed: 'We were in deep, deep, deep grief and panic about our little girl, knowing that she was out there in the mountains alone.

'We were praying and hoping she was alive, fearing that she was injured or even worse.'

In the wake of her resuce, Abrahamsen posted her thanks on Facebook, saying: 'After three rough days lost in the mountain, I have never been happier to be back to civilization and dear Whistler.

'Thanks to my concerned dad, the best roomies, a good rescue staff, good doctors and all the friendly, caring, helping people/seaoners of Whistler.'
