Guardian angels are helping to prop up the extraordinarily expensive campaigns run by Republicans seeking election to the White House.

One ‘super PAC’ supporters group for Mitt Romney spent $14million on advertising in three states last month - but still has $16million in the bank.

And early Facebook investor Peter Thiel gave $1.7million to a group for Ron Paul last month, on top of the $900,000 he donated in December.

Restore Our Future, the super PAC for 
former Massachusetts governor Mr Romney, raised $7million in January, 
reported the New York Times.

Almost $5million of this figure came 
from only 25 individuals or companies who gave donations from $100,000 
and $500,000 to the super PAC.

Donors who put forward $500,000 
included Oklahoma mining executive Joseph Craft and New York billionaire
hedge fund founder Bruce Kovner.

Mr Craft is worth $1.3billion and Mr 
Kovner has a value of $4.3billion, according to Forbes figures reported 
by New York Magazine.

Mr Romney’s fellow Mormon David 
Lisonbee, who runs a Utah vitamin supplements firm, also donated $500,000, reported the New York Times.

Other Romney donors included Texas billionaire Harold Simmons, the Marriott family behind the hotels and the Walton family behind Wal-Mart.

This reflects the growing desire within the Romney camp to quickly wipe out his three remaining rivals, who have proven a tough challenge.

While Mr Romney has won key primaries in New Hampshire and Florida, he was beaten by Newt Gingrich in South Carolina last month.

Rick Santorum won caucuses in 
Colorado, Iowa and Minnesota - and the Missouri primary. But Mr Romney 
won the Maine and Nevada caucuses.

There
has been no clear pattern in the GOP contests, with the momentum 
see-sawing between Mr Romney, Mr Gingrich and Mr Santorum.

Nevada casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson 
has already given $11million with his wife to Winning Our Future, the 
super PAC for Mr Gingrich.

Now Mr Adelson, who is worth 
$25billion, is expected to inject another $10million and told Forbes he 
could even donate $100million.

‘I’m against very wealthy ­people 
attempting to or influencing elections,’ he told Forbes. ‘But as long as
it’s doable I’m going to do it.’

But Mr Paul, still searching for his first win, does have the backing of billionaire Mr Thiel, portrayed in 2010 film The Social Network by CSI star Wallace Langham.

Mr Thiel, of California, who backed the Endorse Liberty super PAC for Mr Paul, is worth $1.5billion.

President Barack Obama’s campaign raised $29million last month but the major super PAC backing him, Priorities USA Action, raised just $58,000.

Super PAC groups were made possible under a Supreme Court ruling in 2010 and must legally remain independent from candidates they support.
