Despite their inconsistent start to the season and an injury crisis that has left their squad bereft of some world class talent, Manchester United's players appear to be in good spirits ahead of their clash against Arsenal on Saturday.

David De Gea was a doubt for the match after dislocating his finger on international duty with Spain but trained with the squad and was all smiles in Ander Herrera's upload via Instagram.

Luke Shaw, Angel di Maria and Michael Carrick also trained in the week in what is undoubtedly a massive boost for manager Louis van Gaal.

But United's midfield will be missing Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo is still out of the defence as he recovers from a shoulder injury. 

Arguably the most frustrating absentee is Radamel Falcao, who has picked up another injury after struggling initially with a calf issue.

The players looked relaxed enough traveling with their laptop, bottles of water and Forbes magazine, which features stories on finance, industry, investing, and marketing topics.

Forbes is also particularly known for its lists, including revealing who the richest Americans are in the world.  

United are seventh in the Premier League table but a victory at The Emirates on Saturday would see them overtake Arsene Wenger's side.
