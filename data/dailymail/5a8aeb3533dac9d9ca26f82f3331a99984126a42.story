Speaking on Alan Carr's TV chat programme Chatty Man, the former England star thanked his friends - among them Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard - for paying for his recent stint in rehab.

But the 45-year-old then said he would not rule out going on another drinking binge.

grateful' for the help given to him by his friends

He also admitted that if he saw others struggling in the street he would pay for cigarettes or buy them a drink as he knew it was 'horrific'  to detox.

During the interview he claimed to have given most of his fortune away to the needy - including £1million to charity - and said he had sometimes sent money to 'old dears' who had written to him saying they did not have enough money to pay for Christmas dinner. 

He said: 'If all the Premier League players did that there would be £60m in a fund for people to get well.'

Chatty Man is on tonight at 10pm on Channel 4.
