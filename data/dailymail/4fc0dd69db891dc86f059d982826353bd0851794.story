An angry dwarf was given an ASBO for a string of nuisance calls to emergency services and a campaign of public abuse just weeks after he mounted a dirty protest in a council office.

Ian Salter-Bromley, 54,  called Humberside Fire Brigade four times claiming he had either lost his keys or was locked out of his council flat and needed crews to let him in.

His first call - on August 15 - was just two weeks after he exposed himself and spread excrement and urine in Hull City Council's Wilson Centre, which deals with customer services.

Ian Salter-Bromley, 54, made a string of nuisance phone calls to emergency service crews just weeks before he staged a dirty protest - spreading urine and excrement - at council offices in Hull

He had gone to complain about his kitchen worktops being too high and that his disability needs were not being met when he staged the dirty protest in the main reception and toilets.

Salter-Bromley, who is 4ft tall, failed to attend his ASBO hearing at Hull County Court as Kingston upon Hull City Council advocate Paul Thompson set out the authority's application.

Mr Thompson said an existing court injunction was in place to protect council staff from his repeated abuse, but after publicity about his protest a string of other complaints were made to the council.

He added the first of the wasted emergency calls was made on August 15 but was followed with similar calls on August, 21, 23 and 26.

He said on each occasion  Salter-Bromley would dial 999 saying he was locked out and needed assistance to get in.

Fire crews attended his home in Hull, which meant they were not available for potential emergency work, said Mr Thompson.

This was in addition to his behaviour where he described the  help centre staff as 'useless f*****s' before removing his trousers and fouling the floor twice on July 29 leaving it for staff to clean.

Salter-Bromley had claimed the council had not taken action to protect him from his neighbours and left adaptations in his council flat 8inches too high for him to reach.

Mr Thompson said the judge had the power to grant an antisocial behviour order if he accepted that Salter-Bromley was likely to behave in a manner likely to cause harm or distress to other members of the public.

Judge Jeremy Richardson, QC, said he accepted Salter-Bromley had been informed of the hearing and he was known to him from the breach of his injunction in July.

'There have been a variety of orders to prevent him from behaving in an uncivilized way,' said Judge Richardson. 

'It appears in August and September he has behaved in a thoroughly uncivilised manner. When he is locked out of his home, all he does is call 999 and summon the fire brigade. It is a complete misuse of the emergency system. 

'He has made a nuisance of himself in the main railway station and St Stephen's Shopping Centre insulting and threatening staff. He has made a hoax telephone call to the emergency services. 

'I am entirely satisfied that Mr Salter-Bromley has behaved in an anti-social manner and it is necessary to protect the public.'

The judge made an interim Anti Social Behaviour Order for three weeks allowing  Salter-Bromley time to appeal because he failed to attended court. 

Judge Richardson said: 'From my recollection of previous court appearances, I believe if he does attend, that will be a troublesome hearing.'

The ASBO will mean Salter-Bromley is banned from the Hull Paragon Interchange, St Stephen's Shopping Centre and is prohibited from calling the emergency services unless it is a lawful emergency.

He still has a 21-day suspended prison sentence hanging over him imposed at Hull Crown Court in September  for his breach of the council injunction where he exposed himself to council staff.

He failed to attend his hearing at Hull County Court and a judge handed him an antisocial behaviour order in his absence. The interim ASBO  allows him time to appeal because he failed to attend court
