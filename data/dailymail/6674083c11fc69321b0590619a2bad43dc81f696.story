A nightclub criticised by health officials for selling alcohol for just 10p has responded by putting its prices up to 25p a drink because management want to 'defend people's right to party'.

Bosses at Mamas Paradise in Pontardawe near Swansea, which has previously sold drinks for a penny and says is 'the best night out in Wales', maintains they are responsible despite being criticised over their latest knock down drink deals. 

Pictures documenting an evening at the South Wales club show people collapsed inside or being helped home after drinking cheap lager, cider, spirits and alcopops. As they queued dozens of drinkers were even given free shots on their way into the club.

Just last month a new report revealed how excessive alcohol caused 29 deaths every week in Wales, which equates to around 1 in 20 of all deaths.

Battle: Welsh health chiefs were forced to intervene because of the 10p drinks offer over Halloween, so management have responded by raising their prices by 15p to 25p

Defence: Management defended the club's 'all inclusive' drinks policy claiming it is the same as going on an all-inclusive holiday

Welsh health chiefs were forced to intervene because of the 10p drinks offer over Halloween, so management have responded by raising their prices by 15p to 25p. 

A spokesman for the club said: 'Unfortunately due to the publicity we had on Halloween we can no longer do the 10p per drink.

'We are keeping the price as low as possible to try and defend your right to party. We are still the cheapest night out you will get.'

The club has been caught up in a long standing battle with the licensing officers at Neath Port Talbot over their quest to provide outrageously cheap booze.

They had been charging £12 for entry before selling their drinks for 10p during their 10pm to 1am happy hour, which they say is the same as going on an all-inclusive holiday. 

Club bosses have even managed to find a loophole after being told to raise the price of shots of liquor and spirits to 25p.

They have stopped charging customers for a 'mixer' so customers will only have to pay an extra 5p.

And they have even dropped the the price of their potent Jagerbombs from £2 to £1.50.

Health concerns: Campaigners warned today that many of us forget that alcohol is a 'Class A carcinogen'

Health bosses say deals like this 'put unnecessary pressure on our services but it is not good for anyone's health to drink to excess, and you are also putting yourself at risk of injury'

The club has been criticised by the local hospital who said they were 'dismayed' by the drinks deals. 

Paul Roberts, the chief executive of the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said: 'It is irresponsible to sell alcohol so cheaply.

'I call on licensees and the bodies which licence pubs and clubs to consider carefully the effects of encouraging people to drink in excess.

'Not only does it put unnecessary pressure on our services but it is not good for anyone's health to drink to excess, and you are also putting yourself at risk of injury.'

Andrew Langford, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, described the 15p price rise as as 'pathetic' and 'nonsensical'.

He told MailOnline: 'It really is insulting to anyone who has issues with alcohol. People keep forgetting that alcohol is a Class A carcinogen.

'What would the local council do if shops suddenly slashed the price of cigarettes?

'Despite having being spoken to, this club is still continuing to encourage irresponsible drinking.

'It's had one warning shot - surely this is enough to revoke the licence. It's really a health and safety issue.' 

Emily Robinson, director of campaigns at Alcohol Concern, said: 'Selling drinks at 25p is not only highly irresponsible, but it encourages people to drink excessively.

'We would expect the local licensing authority to look into this to see if there’s a breach of licensing obligations.

'Bars need to act responsibly in the way they sell and promote booze because alcohol misuse ends up costing us all. 

'If the government implemented a minimum unit price that would help tackle the cost of alcohol misuse on society and stop things like this from happening. 

Neath Port Talbot Council's licensing manager Neil Chapple said there are Government guidelines on the minimum price of alcohol.

He added: 'The licence holder of Mamas Paradise has been spoken to by officers from the licensing authority, who have reminded him of his duty to comply with the conditions imposed on the licence and to ensure that the licensing objectives are not undermined.'

The co-owner of Mama's Paradise, businessman Alistair Parker, defended the club's 'all inclusive' drinks policy.

He said: 'It's not a case of paying the £12 entrance fee then standing by the bar and downing as much as you can.

'Customers are only allowed two drinks at a time and have to leave the bar to give others the chance of getting served.

'We're properly licensed and have staff at the club who watch if customers are drunk then advise them they have had enough, it's a controlled environment.

'It's similar to all inclusive holidays where drinks are actually free... you don't see people calling for them to be banned.

'The real problem we have is that someone who has reached 18 can go to a superstore, buy several bottles of vodka and down them all if they want to.

'At least in a club situation like ours there are staff looking after people. I was on holiday at the weekend but was told by my staff there were no problems on the Halloween night.

'We have been doing this for two years and people enjoy it. You have to compete with superstores.'
