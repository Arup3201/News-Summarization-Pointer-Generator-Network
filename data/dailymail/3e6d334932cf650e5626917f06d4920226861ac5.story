Labour is considering a new crackdown on so-called ‘non-doms’ – wealthy foreigners who live in Britain but avoid paying tax on their overseas income.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said he was ‘absolutely looking at that for the future’ when asked whether a future Labour government would turn its attention to non-doms.

There are an estimated 116,000 non-doms living in the UK who only have to pay UK taxes on money they bring into the country. Income from overseas investments does not have to be declared.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls is considering a new crackdown on so-called ‘non-doms’ – wealthy foreigners who live in Britain but avoid paying tax on their overseas income

In 2008 Labour announced plans to charge non-doms £30,000 a year if they had been resident in the UK for seven of the previous ten years.

Last year George Osborne announced this charge would be increased to up to £90,000 for those who have lived here for 17 out of the past 20 years.

Mr Balls told the Daily Mail: ‘One of the challenges that you’ve always got to do if you’re going to be a good chancellor is always be asking the question are the tax rules set in previous eras still the right rules for today?

‘And we know we’ve got some real challenges around international tax rules, when companies like Google or Starbucks can move their operations around the world.'

He added: ‘And I think some of those issues…going back 200 years is right that we modernise the rules and that we’re tougher to make sure that people who are living in our city and working in our country, pay taxes in our country.

‘I think people expect Government to do that and that’s what we’ve all got to do.

He added: ‘I think we need to make sure that people living in our country are paying their fair share of tax. We can do that through the mansion tax, which we are proposing. But we toughened up the rules on non-doms. George Osborne has done a bit more on that and I’m absolutely looking at that for the future.’

In an editorial on Monday, the influential newspaper the Financial Times called for non-dom rules to be abolished, pointing out they dated back to 1799 to allow those with foreign property to shelter it from new war taxes.

Last year George Osborne announced the charge paid by non-doms who have lived in the UK for 17 out of the past 20 years would be increased to  £90,000 a year

Describing non-dom rules as an ‘archaism’ and an ‘anomaly’ it said that the government should ‘end the egregious situation where the wealthiest enjoy the privileges of UK residency without paying their fair dues to the exchequer.’

Under Labour, in 2008 non-doms were hit with a £30,000 charge if they had been resident in the UK for seven of the previous 10 years but chose to pay tax somewhere else. In its first year of operation this raised some £130million.

Last year Mr Osborne announced that the annual levy charged on non-doms would be increased for those living here longer.

Anyone resident here for seven of the last nine years keeps paying £30,000 a year, but the fee for those who have been here for 12 out of 14 years will rise to £60,000.

For those who have been in Britain for 17 out of 20 years it will cost £90,000.
