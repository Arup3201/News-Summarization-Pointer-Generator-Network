The pound tumbled yesterday as a surge in support for Scottish independence rocked financial markets and Westminster.

Sterling dropped to nearly a five-month low and shares in some of Scotland’s largest firms, including Royal Bank of Scotland and energy giant SSE, slid after a poll showed support for breaking up the Union has risen dramatically.

The YouGov survey put the lead for the No campaign at six points, down from 14 points in the middle of August and 22 points early last month.

However, a former EU commissioner has said that an independent Scotland would not be able to keep the pound if it wished to be part of the EU.

There has been a growing backlash against the No campaign’s leaders, with calls for Labour, the SNP’s main opposition, to ‘get a grip’.

Ed Miliband, under fire for his absence, will this week divert a trip to Aberdeen to visit Glasgow, while strategists plan to send ‘big beasts’ Gordon Brown and former home secretary John Reid to party heartlands.

First Minister Alex Salmond said independence is ‘closer than it’s ever been’. The SNP has previously benefited from a late pro-nationalist surge in Holyrood elections.

In Westminster, senior figures are starting to discuss the huge potential impact of a Yes win.

One Labour source attacked Douglas Alexander, effective leader of the No campaign, for recent difficulties including ‘patronising’ adverts.

David Cameron insists he will not resign if the referendum he helped set up leads to the end of the Union. But top Tories say he would face a clamour to quit.

There are also questions over the validity of a Labour government elected in 2015 with a small majority. Scots are likely to be able to take part in the general election of MPs to Westminster, a boost for Labour due to its strength in Scotland. But all the Scottish MPs could be swept away if the country becomes independent in March 2016.

Many Tories say it would be unacceptable for Scottish MPs to hold seats in Westminster while London and Edinburgh set out a break-up of the UK.

Mr Cameron’s spokesman said yesterday there were ‘no contingency plans’ for independence. But Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the senior Treasury civil servant, said he was forming a team to deal with a possible Yes vote.

Former Scottish Secretary Lord Forsyth said the No campaign must be ‘more robust’ and convince voters it would be ‘a disaster’ to break the Union. He also claimed No supporters are being intimidated in Scotland.

The pound fell almost a cent against the US dollar to $1.6510, close to a five-month low of $1.6501. It also slipped against the euro, and traders warned it is likely to weaken further.

David Buik, of broker Panmure Gordon, said: ‘This latest poll has fired a shot across the bows and the markets have expressed their concern.’

It came as Olli Rehn, the former European Commissioner for monetary affairs, warned Mr Salmond’s plan to use the pound in defiance of Westminster will see Scotland rejected from the EU.

Mr Salmond has claimed ‘it’s our pound and we’re keeping it’.

Mr Rehn told Lib Dem Danny Alexander this would mean an EU veto. He said it would ‘simply not be possible’ for a country with no monetary authority of its own to be an EU member.

Fate of the Union may be in the hands of older women says JAMES CHAPMAN

If the 307-year-old Union is preserved in the referendum, it may be older Scottish women who save it.

The dramatic poll that sent shudders through Westminster and financial markets shows the Yes campaign has moved into a lead in all age groups except the over-60s. And though the gender gap is being narrowed, women are still more likely to oppose independence than men.

The YouGov poll released on Monday – the first since a second TV debate between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling, which the Scottish First Minister was seen to have won comprehensively – showed a significant shift towards Yes.

Over the space of just a month, YouGov surveys, which have traditionally been the most unfavourable to the Yes campaign, indicate a slump in the No lead from around 20 points to just six. Once ‘don’t knows’ are excluded Yes is on 47 percentage points, a record from YouGov, with No on 53.

That means Mr Salmond needs a shift of just three points to clinch victory – something that appears achievable, given that previously undecided voters now making up their minds appear to be breaking for Yes by around two to one.

Crucially, the Yes campaign appears to be winning over more voters on the economic implications of independence. Before the summer, YouGov had never found more than 30 per cent saying Scotland would be financially better off on its own – but now the figure has risen to 35 per cent.

Mr Salmond is also winning over more of the less well-off social groups, where support for independence is up nine points on a month ago.

Support for Yes among those who voted Labour in the last round of Holyrood elections in 2011 has also increased sharply – from 18 per cent to 30 per cent.

John Curtice, professor of Politics at Strathclyde University, said: ‘Just one group of voters appear to have resisted the tide towards a higher Yes vote – older voters. At 31 per cent, support for Yes among the over-60s is actually slightly down on a month ago.’

YouGov’s Anthony Wells said: ‘As ever, we should be careful of reading too much into a single poll but it looks like this may go down to the wire.’
