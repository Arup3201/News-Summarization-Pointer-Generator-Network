David Cameron has blocked plans to give voters the power to expel MPs found guilty of serious wrongdoing.

The power to ‘recall’ an MP if they are found guilty of a crime, or judged to have committed ‘serious wrongdoing’ by their colleagues, was backed by all three parties after the expenses scandal, as part of restoring public trust in politics.

The Tories and Lib Dems agreed to make it law when the coalition was formed but the idea has now been jettisoned by the Prime Minister and will not feature in the upcoming Queen's Speech.

Ditched: David Cameron refused to include the power of recall policy 
in this year’s Queen’s Speech, which means it will not happen before 
the next election, despite Nick Clegg's promises

If 10 per cent of constituents signed a petition it would have triggered a by-election forcing an errant MP to stand for election again

A petition signed by ten per cent of an MP's constituents who are unhappy with their behaviour would have triggered an automatic by-election under plans included in the coalition agreement.

Nick Clegg went further and suggested any MP given a jail sentence would be automatically kicked out.

But it emerged last night that Mr Cameron and George Osborne have refused to include it in this year’s Queen’s Speech, which means it will not happen before the next election.

The move ignited a fresh coalition row, with the Lib Dems accusing the Tories of being motivated by 'self-preservation' when there was 'no obvious excuse or good reason' to block it.

Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who has been campaigning for the recall plan to be introduced said it showed politicians had failed to grasp why the public 'hated' them.

'Parties can stuff their manifestos full of clever promises, but if voters don't believe them, they may as well present blank sheets,' he wrote on Twitter.

'How is it possible that our leaders still don't understand that the single biggest cause of people's hatred of them is deceit?'

It is understood Lib Dems, who have been pushing for the policy, were informed it had been killed off this week.  Mr Clegg told his MPs about the decision on Tuesday night.

Supporters of the plan say it could have removed Eric Joyce, the former Labour MP who was found guilty of assaulting a Tory MP and several researchers in a drunken episode in a Commons bar.

The MP for Falkirk resigned the Labour whip but is still an independent MP.

Patrick Mercer, who was filmed allegedly soliciting payment for raising issues in parliament last July, could also have fallen victim to it.

He was forced to resign the Conservative whip but will continue to represent Newark until May 2015.

The idea of giving voters a chance to kick out their MP between elections emerged at the height of the expenses scandal in 2009.

Several MPs continued to sit in the Commons and claim expenses even while they were being investigated by the police.

Eric Illsley, the Labour MP for Barnsley Central, stood down voluntarily in February 2011 after pleading guilty to defrauding the taxpayer of £14,500 he claimed in parliamentary expenses. He was later sentenced to 12 months in prison.

Former Labour MPs David Chaytor and Jim Devine were able to remain in Parliament for three months after being charged with false accounting over their expenses.

They departed only after being deselected by Labour, making them ineligible to stand for the party at the general election in May.

The Tories' refusal to support recalling MPs provoked a furious response from the Lib Dems.

Tim Farron, the party’s president, said the Conservatives were motivated by 'self-preservation'. He  told The Independent: ‘This was an important step which we fought for in the Coalition agreement to try and restore some level of trust in politics.

'It sends a message to the electorate that “we don’t trust you. We think you might do things which we don’t like”.'

He later told the BBC: 'It seems very wrong to me that an MP can be in position for the five years of a Parliament, get up to things which all of us would agree are inappropriate and be in a position where they would not be able to be held to account during that time.

'That's the basic, modest proposal that was agreed in the coalition agreement and there's no obvious excuse or good reason for David Cameron to block that vote now, but that is what he has done.'

Graham Allen, chairman of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, which scrutinised the proposal, said he was not surprised it had been dropped, because the moment to introduce it was soon after the expenses scandal and the issue had now lost momentum.

Sadiq Khan MP, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, responding to reports that the Government is set to drop plans to recall MPs, said: 'This is another broken promise from David Cameron. He's now backtracking from his own manifesto commitment to introduce recall of MPs.

'And Nick Clegg's claims back in 2010 that he'd be the 'great reformer' on the constitution are frankly laughable as he's got nothing whatsoever to show for it.'
