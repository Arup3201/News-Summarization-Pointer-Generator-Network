One 17-year-old from canton, Georgia whose girlfriend cheated on him with his best friend decided to get the best revenge by posting a hilarious text exchange between he and his ex on Twitter.

When Kane Zipperman's ex texted him to ask if the relationship was actually over, his response was a carefully thought out series of witty insults and internet memes.

Since posting the conversation on his Twitter @KaneZipperman has received over 71, 762 re tweets and 90, 434 favorites.

Kane Zipperman, 17, got revenge against his cheating ex by being hilarious in a series of texts that he later posted to his Twitter

Kane posted his entire text exchange between he and his ex on Twitter

'So Um...I still like you...alot,' said Kane's ex.

'I like meth,' he wrote as a witty comeback.

As the text exchange progressed his ex wrote, 'It was just one guy. Cmon Kane...Please...I miss you...No guy has ever treated me as good as you...You are literally the sweetest and cutest guy on the planet. Will you please be mine again...?'

Kane charmingly replied with a meme of Mila Kunis saying, 'No. Go f**** yourself.'

Later in the conversation when Kane's ex calls him a 'douche' for posting their conversation on Twitter,  he spins her 'It was just one guy' line into 'It was just one tweet.'

'Can you actually say something to me please?.' she begged.

Kane pointed out that at one point in their conversation his ex was quoting Hitler

Kane then humorously texted back with the infamous meme of the 'I like turtles' kid being interviewed by a news reporter.

'Why do you hate me?' his ex inquired a few minutes later.

'Despite the fact that you cheated on me with my best friend, I don't hate you. I just strongly dislike you.'

His ex then responded, 'Hate is more lasting than dislike.'

Kane then pointed out that his ex was actually quoting Hitler.

The
 conversation continued with Kane saying he'd rather listen to a Jonas 
Brother's song over and over again that go back to his ex. He then told 
her not to text him again.

Even
 though he doesn't want to hear from  his ex he's joyfully been re 
tweeting messages from adoring female fans like @jennegrearr who wrote,'I
 actually cried when @KaneZipperman followed me,' along with hearts and 
smiley faces.

This
 is not the first time Kane has made internet news. Last year Kane was 
spotted wearing a tiger T-Shirt standing behind Tiger Woods as he played
 the Masters game.

Kane told a reporter from Back Nine in an interview in April that he's been following the masters game for the past 7 years.

It seems as though Zipperman's fans will be following his tweets for years to come.
