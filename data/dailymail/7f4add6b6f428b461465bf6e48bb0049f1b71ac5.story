Two runaway teenagers have been found in Jacksonville, Florida, nearly a month after they vanished from their homes 1,000 miles away.

Christian Roe, 15, and  Olivia Kean, 14, both from Michigan, went missing on October 15 after they reportedly took a 2002 Dodge Ram pickup truck from Olivia's family home.

Despite neither of the teenagers being old enough to drive, they apparently traveled to the Florida city, before living out of the truck  for around three weeks.

They were found by police on Thursday after Christian called his parents saying he wanted to come home. They were both taken into police custody, Bay County Undersheriff, Troy Cunningham, said.

Distance: Christian, from Auburn, and Olivia, from Midland, were found in Jacksonville, 1,000 miles away

Christian's mother, Kari Roe-LaFramboise,  spent two days searching Jacksonville with her husband, Joe LaFramboise, and Christian's father, Jay Roe, after receiving the phone call on Tuesday night.

However, neither the trio nor authorities were unable to locate the teenager until around 1pm on Thursday - despite the Dodge Ram pickup being parked just streets away.

'It was crazy,' Mrs Roe-LaFramboise told Michigan Live. 'We were walking up and down every road downtown, handing out flyers to every single person.

'People kept telling us where to go and they were about two blocks from us.'

Pre-planned? At the time of the teenagers' disappearance, Christian left with just the clothes he was wearing, while Olivia (left) did pack a number of possessions, including her black Chihuahua, Salsa (right)

During the call at around 10pm on Tuesday, Christian, who lives in Auburn, had told his parents that he was no longer with Olivia, from Midland. 

'He said he was safe, that he'd hurt his ankle, and that he was no longer with Olivia,' Mrs Roe-LaFramboise told the news station earlier this week.

'He borrowed some lady's phone on the road so he could call and say he wanted to come home.'

However, Olivia was also discovered in the area, it is reported.

The  girl, who apparently had been on probation and severed an electronic tether prior to her disappearance, remains in police custody.

Meanwhile, Christian was released into his parents' care on Thursday evening. 

'I'm just happy this is all over now,'  Mrs Roe-LaFramboise said as her son was freed. 'No words are able to describe how horrible it's been.'

At the time of the teenagers' disappearance, Christian left with just the clothes he was wearing, while Olivia did pack a number of possessions, including her black Chihuahua, Salsa.

In need of attention: Following the teens' disappearance, Olivia's (pictured) mother Katrina Kean, set up a Facebook page in a bid to locate the pair. In one post, she said her daughter has a serious medical condition

In following weeks, Olivia's mother Katrina Kean, set up a Facebook page in a bid to locate the pair. In one post, she said her daughter has a serious medical condition that requires attention.

However, it remains unknown what medical condition Olivia suffers from. The well-being of her pet chihuahua is also unclear.

An investigation is ongoing. It is not yet known whether any criminal charges will be filed.

The news station was unable to reach Ms Kean for comment.
