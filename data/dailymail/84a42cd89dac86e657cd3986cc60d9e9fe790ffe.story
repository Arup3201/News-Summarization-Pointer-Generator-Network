If your favoured work out involves counting calories on high tech digital equipment and you enjoy a sauna and steam at the end of your session, then the Kachalka gym in the Ukraine is probably not for you.

With muscle-bound gym goers using stacked tyres as a punch bag and free weights chained to the ground surrounded by unorthodox makeshift metal machines, the gym looks more like a scrapyard than a fitness centre.

And you won't just be dripping with sweat should the heavens open during an intense workout.

Al fresco: Gym goers of all ages and fitness levels flock to Kachalka outdoor gym in Kiev - because it's free

Tough guys: Men hit punching bags made out of tyres as they train at the Kachalka outdoor gym on the banks of river Dniper

For Kachalka - perhaps the most hardcore outdoor gym in the world - is completely open to the elements.

But formed in the early 1970s, the Ukraine's answer to California's Muscle Beach has increased in popularity over the last four decades and is now home to more than 200 different fitness machines.

The brainchild of a Polish gymnast Kasmir Jagelsky and maths professor Yuri Kuk, the 6.2 square mile outdoor fitness centre is located on the island of Tuhen right in the heart of the nation's capital Kiev.

Unlike the luxury, members-only health clubs many of us are used to, Kachalka won't set you back an arm and a leg - you can work out there for free.

Packed: The gym, which was formed in the early 1970s, has grown in popularity over the past four decades

Fitness fanatics: The gym was founded by Polish gymnast Kasmir Jagelsky and maths professor Yuri Kuk in the early 1970s

Unorthodox: The equipment, some of which looks more like torture machinery than something that belongs in a gym, is made mostly from old machinery and scrap metal

Put to new use: Much of the equipment was made when scrap metal was at a surplus in the country during the Cold War

Hardcore: An outdoor gym seemingly attended mostly by musclebound men, the Kachalka gym is a tough environment

Its name comes from the Ukranian word 'kachat' which literally means 'to pump'.

Many of the machines were created when there was a surplus of scrap metal in the country during the Cold War years and consist of spare parts from machines and vehicles.

Rusted tank chains and marine salvage parts have been roughly forged together to create the most primitive and basic of strength and resistance machines.

Made mostly of metal and wood, the machines are painted blue and most lack the luxury of padded seats or soft plastic coated pulleys.

Much of the equipment is chained to the ground so that it isn't stolen.

Onlooker: An older gym-goer waits patiently as youngsters aim for bigger biceps on some of the equipment

Bulking up: A young fitness fanatic struggles to push out one final rep as he attempts to build bigger muscles at Kachalka

All ages welcome: An older woman stretches as she enjoys a workout at the huge outdoor fitness centre in Kiev

Getting stronger: The name of the gym comes from the Ukranian word Kachat which literally means 'to pump'

Security: Much of the equipment in the gym is chained to the ground so that it is not stolen
