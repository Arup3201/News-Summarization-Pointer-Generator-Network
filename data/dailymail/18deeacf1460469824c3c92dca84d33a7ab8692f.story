As a Sky News anchor, I spend from 6am to 7pm on my feet. At 5ft 5in tall, high heels are essential if I’m to have any screen presence, and while I adore my sexy 6in-heel LK Bennett courts, I’d love a pair which make my working day less of a torture. I’ve always found cushioned soles and round-toed shoes far too fuddy-duddy. But now, designers claim they can make sexy shoes comfortable. I put my best (size six) foot forward to find out . . .

Riley black rubber heeled shoes (£155, senso at asos.com)

These on-trend sandals have blocky, 
rubber heels for better grip and weight-distribution. It took me three 
minutes to tackle the fiddly laces and the shoes were heavy, but easy to
 wear — even if I did look like Russell Crowe in Gladiator.They’re not very feminine, and look  terrible with a dress. If I had to wear them, I’d put them with trousers — or a toga.

Python print leather with cross strap (£55, gb.geox.com)

The
 sandal looks dainty and feminine, the heel is thick and stable, 
reducing the risk of post-prandial wobbles. Cushioning on the inner sole
 is thick and squishy while the cross strap dips away from the ankle — 
making your leg look elongated and elegant. A great bonus for the 
vertically challenged! The shoes are breathable — so no sweaty feet or 
blisters.

Pink lattice heels (£220, sargossa.com)

These lattice shoes are certainly showstoppers, and you’d never guess they boast a hidden padded insole.

But
 when I wore these to a barbecue, I turned heads for all the wrong 
reasons.

It wasn’t just that I looked like a TOWIE wannabe, it was that 
they made a really loud clomping noise.

The
 insole was comfortable, the leather lattice cut into my feet and when I
 tried to take them off, I discovered the zip had stuck. More like a 
form of torture than a fashion item.

COMFORT: 1/10

Padded peep toe wedge (£45, hotter.com)

Soft
 leather uppers and padding make these the most comfortable heels I’ve 
ever worn. I felt like I was walking on air. They went on at breakfast 
time and, 12 hours later, it was as though I’d been on my feet for just 
ten minutes. But — and it’s a
 big but — the nasty beige colour and old-fashioned twist at the toe are
 hideously grannyish and unflattering. Sorry, but even Miss Marple would
 run a mile from these.

White ankle strap shoes (£192, chiemihara.com)

The
 thick, column-style heel made these look as if like they’d come 
straight from the set of Strictly.

But they were really comfy, though I 
didn’t love the strap across the ankle, which shortens the leg. A
 few of us at Sky News have a book club and we go dancing once a month.

Next time, I’m out with them tripping the light fantastic, I’ll be in 
these.
