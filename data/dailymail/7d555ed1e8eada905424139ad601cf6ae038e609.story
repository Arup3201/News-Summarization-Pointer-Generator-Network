Luis Figo and Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein of Jordan, two of the four challengers for the FIFA presidency, have quickly supported the joint BBC and Sky initiative of a live TV debate. 

Figo, a former world footballer of the year, said: ‘The fans deserve to know what the candidates offer for the future.’ 

But the project is doomed because Sepp Blatter’s reply, after he returns from a trip to Paraguay this week, will be to turn down the request.

The FA want to send two Great Britain football teams to compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics but a row has broken out with other home nations even before the qualification process starts.

FA technical director Dan Ashworth and England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate want young England players to gain tournament experience. Their view has the backing of chairman Greg Dyke, leading to the FA changing their mind about sending only a women’s side — if any — to Brazil.

The FA’s departing general secretary Alex Horne wrote to the other three countries on his last day in office at Wembley informing them that it was now their intention to enter both Olympic football competitions.

However, the manner of the FA taking the lead on raising the teams infuriated Wales, especially, and Northern Ireland, leading to a stormy meeting between officials at the IFAB summit in Belfast last Friday. 

Scotland were less concerned because of their long, unequivocal opposition to the GB football format, which they see as a threat to their independence within FIFA.

The main sensitivity with the Welsh and the Irish was why the FA had the divine right to be the national association with the football seat on the British Olympic Association since its inception in 1905. Wales are also upset about the FA reneging — owing to a rules change — on a gentlemen’s agreement over the rotation of the British vice-president seat on FIFA executive committee.

The rumpus has led to FIFA telling the FA to sort out the internal fighting before submitting their GB football applications. The men’s side would need to reach the last four of the European Under 21 Championship this summer to qualify .

The Olympic issue has raised extra emotions because it follows all the fuss around the home nations providing players at London 2012 for a Team GB side that the BOA mandated England to select.

A BOA spokesperson said: ‘We have received confirmation from the FA of their intention to enter into the qualification process for Rio for both men’s and women’s tournaments.’

FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke claimed at the IFAB summit in Belfast that FIFA had heard nothing from the Dutch FA ahead of that meeting about a proposal for a video assistant to aid the referee.

The FA had strongly supported the plan for the technology to be trialled in the Dutch Cup, but that was rejected by the FIFA representatives on IFAB. Now it has emerged that the Dutch FA had asked ‘several times’ to present to FIFA, without success.

To add to the conspiracy, Dutch FA president Michael van Praag is standing for the FIFA presidency and a green light for the technology test would have given him added kudos in the build-up to the May election.

The Premier League need more room in their Gloucester Place headquarters in London — not least to count their billions from TV rights — and are evicting their Football League sub-tenants. As a result the FL are moving offices to the ITN building in Gray’s Inn Road next week, having been given notice last November. Curiously, the FL claim their relationship with the PL is the best it’s been for years — though you’d never have guessed.

Roy won’t hand JT recall

England manager Roy Hodgson gave John Terry a warm handshake as Chelsea’s captain passed him in the Royal Box after a peerless performance in the Capital One Cup final.

But although Hodgson described Terry afterwards as ‘a friend from way back’, he said nothing else should be read into the greeting. Terry, 34, who retired from international football in 2012, is still by far the best English centre back.
