New DNA evidence has allowed a jury to find a 56-year-old convicted sex-offender guilty of the murder of an aspiring model - 27-years after he was first arrested for her killing.

On Monday the Pamona Superior Court jury agreed with the prosecution that Stafford Spicer stabbed 23-year-old Jo Anne Marie Jones to death after trying to rob, kidnap and rape her.

Originally the prime suspect of the murder of the pretty blonde in 1985, Spicer was conivcted this week after new evidence from Los Angeles County Sheriff's department showed that blood found on the floor and cup holder of Jones' Camaro contained his DNA.

Anne Marie Jones, 23, went missing in October 1985 after leaving her boyfriends house in Long Beach, California - Joel Spicer was convicted of her murder at the Pomona Superior Court on October 1st

Spicer now faces life in prison without parole and will be sentenced on October 12th at the Pamona Superior Court in California.

'I'm really thankful the jury took all the time to consider all the evidence and I'm really thankful to cold case detective Steve Davis, who spent several years on the case,' said Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan to the SGV-Tribune.

Covina native Jones disappeared after leaving her boyfriend's Long Beach residence on the morning of April 29th and drove off in her 1978 Chevrolet Camaro after spending the night at his house.

Upon calling the West Covina Travel Agency where she worked later in the day, her boyfriend was told she had never arrived there and soon after reported her missing to the police.

'She never went to work. Her family 
never heard from her again. She simply disappeared off the face of the 
earth,' said Monaghan to the jury at the start of the trial.

Three
days after her disappearance, Jones' boyfriend spotted her Camaro in 
Long Beach and called the police who discovered it and Spicer in the 
parking lot of a supermarket.

Spicer was arrested and held, but denied any knowledge of her disappearance and was released when no trace of Jones was found.

One month after later, four hikers discovered the missing model's body near East Forks Road, east of Highway 39.

A
coroner's office examination determined that she had been stabbed to 
death but still police at the time had insufficient evidence to charge 
Spicer with and he was released.

In 2008, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Homicide Detective Steve Davis decided to review Jones’ cold case.

Upon
the review, Detective Davis discovered blood found on the floor mat and
cup holder of the Camaro contained Jones’ DNA and Spicer's and a warrant was put out
for his arrest.

Police took three years to trace Spicer to Las Vegas, where he was unemployed and living as a drifter.

On March 8th, 2011, LASD detectives and Las Vegas police arrested Spicer without incident at the 3000 block of Cabana Avenue and brought him back to California.

During the trial, Detective Davis convinced Monaghan to have the Jury visit the site where Jones' body was discovered and Spicer's old residence which was near to the model's boyfriend's home.

In addition, the prosecution found a key witness who testified that they had heard Spicer admit to the murder and replayed inconsistencies the sex-offender told police in 1985 as to how he acquired the Camaro.

Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan added that he believed that Jones’ murder was a crime of opportunity and that Spicer wanted her Camaro.

Deputy District Attorney Monaghan’s praise of Detective Davis echoed a statement made by LASD Captain Mike Parker after Spicer was caught in 2011.

'The motto of the Sheriff’s Cold Case Homicide Unit is ‘Time is on our side,” said Captain Parker, 'Homicide cases are never closed until they are solved.'
