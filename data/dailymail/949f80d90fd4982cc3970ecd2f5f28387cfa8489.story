Men called Wayne, Liam and Ryan are mostly likely to cheat on their partners, so says a recent survey anyway.

A study of 2,000 women looked at their experiences with men and saw Wayne ranked as the least trustworthy name when it comes to love.

Liam, Ryan and Matt also ranked highly in the list of 'love rat' names, with Craig, Steve and Scott closely following.

Sadly, straying celebrities such as Liam Gallagher, 
Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs do 
little to rescue their names' reputations.

Liam Gallagher and Wayne Rooney have both previously hit headline accused of cheating on their wives

Dean, Mark and Lee appeared among the shifty top ten, while lads named Harry, Ashley and Nick also raise a red flag for women.

The survey found 68 per cent of women have fallen victim to a two-timing Casanova at least once.

Footballer Ryan Giggs has faced numerous allegations of cheating, including cheating on his wife with his sister-in-law

One in ten is currently dating a man accused of being a 'love rat', regardless of their seedy reputation.

The research into trustworthy names was commissioned by domain name registration site Siteopia.com and found seven in ten women had been hurt by a love rat in the past.

1. Wayne

2. LiamÂ 

3. Ryan

4. Matt

5. Craig

6. Steve

7. Scott

8. Dean

9. Mark

10. Lee

11. Harry

12. Ashley

13. Nick

14. Daniel

15. John

16. Sean

17. Darrell

18. Tom

19. James

20. Jack

Yesterday a spokesman for Siteopia.com, who conducted the study, said: 'It's telling that the top three names women try to avoid are also the names of well-known celebrity cheaters.

'According to the results these men may well have more of a wandering eye than others, but of course it's a person's actions they should be judged on not the name they go by.

'Names have great power and we will naturally recall bad experiences and make certain associations with a name if we've been affected by people with that name in the past.'

Suspicious names that came lower in the top 20 included Daniel, John and Sean, followed by Darrell, Tom and James. The popular boy's name, Jack, ranked at number 20.

The main reason a man becomes a love rat is if he has more than one girlfriend, claimed 63 per cent of women.

Other tell-tale signs were texting behind their partner's back, being generally untrustworthy, and men spending more time with friends than their girlfriend.

The Siteopia.com spokesman added: 'We should never underestimate the power of a name in influencing our opinions, even if we're not conscious of it.

'If people have a bad experience, whether with a person, a company or a service, that name will stay with us a long time and influence us going forward.

'Even in business, a name says a lot. Picking the right name and making sure it communicates the right things to the right audience is crucial.'
