Mario Balotelli shared a selfie with brother Enoch on Monday - wearing a Rey Mysterio mask to disguise himself. 

The Liverpool forward was pictured with his younger sibling in the mask with his tongue sticking out. 

Both uploaded the selfie onto their respective Instagram accounts saying: 'Rey Mysterio mask... we just don't care with love.'

Mario and Enoch maintain a close bond, with the latter regularly uploading selfies of the pair together.

Enoch, who like his brother is a footballer, has previously revealed that his dream is to play alongside Mario, although currently that seems a far distant dream.

The 21-year-old recently left Italian lower-league side Vallecamonica by mutual agreement following a two-month spell, with Balotelli Jnr failing to impress. 

Balotelli Snr himself has a fight on his hands to save his Liverpool career after failing to impress on Merseyside since joining from AC Milan last summer - scoring just twice in 18 appearances.
