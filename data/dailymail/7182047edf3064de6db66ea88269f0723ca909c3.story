Sleeping on the job is hardly something most employers want to encourage, but one designer has created a desk with exactly that in mind.

Tired workers can now try catch up with their sleep at work and snooze in their office in comfort, thanks to the Daydreamer Desk.

The desk is topped with a mattress, which has a small wooden block cut into it to provide a stable area for a notepad or coffee cup.

Designer Nick DeMarco, 27, hopes it will encourage a 'laid back casual attitude towards work and life'.

And he described it as a 'practical and comfortable stress reliever'.

Mr DeMarco, from New York, said: 'It has not been designed to encourage employees to spend every moment at their desk, even during sleep.

'Instead, I hope to encourage a laid back casual attitude towards work and life.

Mattress: The surface of the desk is soft foam, upholstered in a waterproof neoprene fabric

'The Daydreamer Desk suggests thoughtful day-dreaming, introspection, and brain work is just as important as any other task that could be completed at ones desk.'

The surface of the desk is soft foam, upholstered in a waterproof neoprene fabric. The structure is made of powder-coated steel.

A wooden block cut into the foam measures 8.5 inches by 11 inches.

Mr DeMarco runs his own furniture studio and produces one-off pieces to order. The desk costs Â£950.

He has also created the Zen Desk, which has a sand-pit on the surface, allowing workers to doodle and run the sand through their hands.

He said: 'This piece takes the concept of using your desk for "brain work" even further.'
