A Mexican woman known as a drug cartel queen has pleaded guilty in Miami to drug charges arising from a major cocaine trafficking case.

Court records show Sandra Avila Beltran pleaded guilty Tuesday to being an accessory after the fact in an organization that included Juan Diego Espinosa Ramirez. He was her boyfriend at the time.

Espinosa was a former liaison between Mexico's Sinaloa cartel and Colombia's Norte Valle cartel. He pleaded guilty in 2009 to cocaine trafficking charges.

A statement signed by Avila, who was 
known as the 'Queen of the Pacific,' says she provided money to Espinosa
for travel and lodging so he could evade arrest by authorities between 
2002 and 2004.

The 52-year-old, famous from getting 
Botox injections in jail, faces a maximum of 15 years in prison at a 
July 25 sentencing hearing.

Her American attorney, Steve Ralls, told the New York Daily News Avila, whom he described as being in very good spirits, may be released from the downtown Miami prison and could get credit for time served.

Mexican officials extradited the suspected drug trafficker to the United States in August 2012.

Avila Beltran was handed over at the Toluca airport 
outside Mexico City to U.S. Marshals who took her to Miami to face federal 
cocaine-trafficking charges, the attorney general's office said.

Avila had been acquitted of similar charges in Mexico and 
her defense argued unsuccessfully that meant she should not be extradited.

In June, a court granted the extradition so she could face 
the charges pending in the U.S., where prosecutors allege she also had links to 
cocaine seizures in Chicago.

In 2001, U.S. agents intercepted a telephone call 
in which Avila allegedly asked for payment for 220lbs of 
cocaine delivered in Chicago.

Prosecutors allege Avila spent more than a decade working her way to the top of Mexico's drug trade. She faces federal cocaine-trafficking charges now that she is in the U.S.

Federal prosecutors said the extradition request indicates 
Avila belonged to an organization that trafficked cocaine from Colombia to the 
United States. U.S. prosecutors allege she helped store and move shipments of 
the drug from Mexico to the United States.

Until Thursday, Avila had been held in a prison in Mexico's 
Pacific coast state of Nayarit, pending trial for a separate money-laundering 
charge.

It was not immediately clear how Mexican prosecutors would proceed with 
that case.

Avila, who was arrested in 2007 sipping coffee in a Mexico 
City diner, has said she is innocent.

A popular narcocorrido ballad about her sung by the band Los Tigres del Norte, titled The Queen of Queens, describes her 2007 arrest alongside Espinosa.

'The more beautiful the rose,' one line in the song says, 'the sharper the thorns.'

Prosecutors have alleged that Avila spent more than a decade 
working her way to the top of Mexico's drug trade. They say her romance with 
Colombian Juan Diego Espinoza brought together Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel 
with Colombia's Norte del Valle.

regions of Mexico.

The New York Times has reported that Avila was arrested in 2007 while having coffee in a Mexico City diner. She calmly asked the federal agents to let her freshen her makeup before the police filmed her walking out in tight jeans and stilettos on the arm of a law enforcement officer.

Born into the drug trafficking business, prosecutors have alleged that Avila spent more than a decade working her way to the top of Mexico's drug trade using a lethal combination of a sharp business sense, connections and sex appeal.

They say her long-time romantic relationship with suspected Colombian Juan Diego Espinoza, also known as 'El Tigre,' brought together Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel with Colombia's feared Norte del Valle.

While most of her lovers were involved with the drug trade, both of her husbands came from a decidedly different background. Her first husband, José Luis Fuentes, was the commander of the federal police in Sinaloa, who was later executed.

Later, she married Rodolfo López Amavizca, the commander of the now-defunct National Institute for the Combat Against Drugs, who was also murdered. 

Officials said that in parallel to her successful cocaine-shipping business, Avila established a string of tanning salons and a real estate company in Sinaloa. But her luck began to change in 2001, when the authorities seized a tuna boat in the port of Manzanillo and found more than nine tons of cocaine aboard worth $80million.

Six months later, Avila’s son was kidnapped and she went to the authorities for help. She had eventually paid a $5million ransom to get her son back, which made law enforcement officials suspicious.

An investigation into Avila’s businesses has revealed that she was allegedly linked to the Manzanillo cocaine shipment, but by that time, the ‘Queen of the Pacific’ had gone underground, living under the pseudonym Daniela García Chavez with her Colombian kingpin boyfriend.

When she was finally captured and jailed, Avila, the curvaceous, dark-haired beauty long known for her love of luxury, caused an outrage when it was revealed that she received Botox injections behind bars.

She also complained about insects in her cell and claimed that the ban on bringing in food from restaurants violated her rights.
