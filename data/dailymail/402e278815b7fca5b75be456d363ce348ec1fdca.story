Some may know Christiaan Van Vuuren better as Dom Nader from Bondi Hipsters, while others may have followed his journey from the Fully Sick Rapper before the apathetic characters went viral on YouTube.

But there was an unlikely catalyst that kick-started Christiaan's career and now he, his brother Connor Van Vuuren and their friend Nick Boshier are pinned as some of Australia's most promising and innovative comedians and producers.

In 2009 Christiaan, originally from Cronulla Beach south of Sydney, travelled to South America for a holiday away from his Sydney advertising job. What he didn't know was that he would bring back with him a rare and deadly disease.

In 2009 Christiaan spent over six months quarantined in a Sydney hospital after he contracted tuberculosis, seen here in a recreation for one of his projects

The then 27-year-old was diagnosed with tuberculosis after he was rushed to hospital coughing up blood. He spent 21 days in quarantine before he was released.

But Christiaan received a phone call just weeks later, when one of his doctors broke the news that he actually contracted a drug-resistant form of the disease.

Back in the Sydney hospital room where he would spent more than six months straight in quarantine, he had to find a way to amuse himself.

In a bid to fill the long days spent mostly in isolation, Christiaan started making videos with the aid of his new laptop in a bid to entertain himself, and a handful of friends. From this, the Fully Sick Rapper was born.

'It was a bit of a fluke really - it wasn't like getting TB made me go "I want to make videos",' Christiaan told Daily Mail Australia.

The trio have garnered international fame and recently appeared in an advertisement for Old Spice

'At first I was just kind of really bored and dealing with what it was like to be confined ... They had me on a lot of medication which affected my attention span', he said.

Christiaan filmed himself making an array of hilarious and touching videos from the confines of his hospital room - most of which revolved around his sickness.

His doctor, TB specialist Dr Hazel Goldberg told ABC's Australian Story it was inspiring to see someone deal with a potentially life-threatening illness in such a positive way.

But Dr Goldberg also revealed just how serious the disease was: 'It was clear from the state of Christiaan when he presented at the hospital that this was a fairly advanced case'.

What started as a pass-time for Christiaan developed into hundreds of thousands of views from a growing online audience, despite the comedian's initial refusal to engage with social media.

By 2009 Facebook had really taken off worldwide but Christiaan didn't want anything to do with it. 'Why would you want to watch your friends online - why not catch up with them?' he said.

The irony that it was social media - where he has millions of views on Youtube and close to 100,000 likes across various Facebook pages - that really kickstarted Christiaan's career is not lost on him.

Fast forward through Christiaan's long recovery, which involved daily trips to the hospital for treatment for a full year after his release, the he Connor - known then as the Van Buuren Brothers - met Nick Boshier.

Coming together over their shared Youtube prominence the group decided to collaborate, and the gluten-free clean-living fashion-conscious Bondi Hipsters, originally just the Hipsters, were created.

Following the exploits of Dom Nader, played by Christiaan, and Nick as Adrian 'Aids' Archer, Bondi Hipsters 'started off as a little left-jab at those Bondi guys'.

Arguably their best-know Bondi Hipsters video The Organic Life has raked in over a million views on YouTube

Nick Boshier, who portrays Adrian Archer in the comedy pieces, joined forced the with Van Vuuren brothers after meeting them at a YouTube conference

The group release regular videos and have a new one on the way at the end of this week

The idea for Bondi Hipsters spawned from the contradictions they observed in people living in the area

'Whenever you go out there's lots of young kids out interested in environmentalist issue but they weren't changing their own lives... (They) care about all the big things as long as they don't affect their own lives', Christiaan elaborated.

Their most popular video is titled The Organic Life, and highlights the contradictions they observed in people living a 'clean' life in Bondi while hitting up the party scene on the weekends. 

Christiaan's time in hospital also reignited the strong friendship between he and Connor. 'I would say my brother is my best friend', Christiaan said.

On Four Corners Connor just how strong the bond which emerged from his sibling's illness was and said: 'I thought if I get it too (TB) that's okay at least I'll be in there. And it was a bit of a self destructive instinct'.

'I was fighting back tears watching that in the living room - I know he just wanted me to get better', Christiaan told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was a really emotional moment.'

While Christiaan has become somewhat of a spokesperson for the group, he made sure it was known just how much work goes on behind the scenes and the hard yards Nick and Connor also put in.

'I can't stress enough how much they are responsible for', he said. 'And so much of this is owed to Connor, he's a brilliant writer', Christiaan added. 

The trio's latest venture is a TV show on ABC 2 called Soulmates, which tracks the friendship of two souls through the ages

Dom and Adrian are up for Cleo Bachelor of the year, but the characters insist they would never enter themselves as it's too mainstream

Their move to TV sees them jump from the computer screen to the small screen thanks to their immense popularity online

The hard work has paid off for the trio and the they have made the jump from computer screens to the small screen.

Their new TV series title Soulmates will air on ABC 2 next month, and is loosely based on the character quirks and traits evident in the Bondi Hipsters.

It tracks two souls as they live their lives through different reincarnations, and despite the out-there graphics and crazy concepts Christiaan said reincarnation 'feels like a more possible concept than it used to'.

The show is based on 'the idea if you're in a reincarnating soul what happens from life to life? Is the idea of a soul mate... is there a reason for that? Is it because they were someone else to you in another lifetime?'

The boys are also keeping very busy making as much content as they can across all platforms and the Bondi Hipsters are set to release a new video at the end of this week taking on the financial system and the big 'bahnks'.

Characters Dom and Adrian have also been nominated for Cleo Bachelor of the year, and although they insist they didn't nominate themselves, Christiaan had other thoughts about that.

'My opinion as Christiaan is that Dom entered himself, but pretended he didn't.'

'Then Adrian entered because Dom did', he laughed.
