David Cameron was today accused of doling out honours to former ministers sacked in the reshuffle in a bid to 'sweeten the pill of dismissal'.

The Prime Minister is preparing to recommend that two Tory MPs be made Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.

Former international development minister Alan Duncan and ex foreign office minister Hugh Robertson are in line for the honour, according to reports today.

David Cameron was accused of an 'abuse' of the honours system for doling our knighthoods to sacked ministers to 'sweeten the pill of dismissal'

Oliver Heald, who was Solicitor General until Monday, will also get a knighthood.

Veteran minister Ken Clarke, 74, meanwhile, is in line to become a Companion of Honour - one of the highest honours available, according to the Evening Standard.

This top honour is reserved for the Queen and just 65 other members.

The honour is awared for service of national importance and Mr Clarke will join illustrous company including the painter Lucian Freud, Professor Stephen Hawking, naturalist Sir David Attenborough, and ex-Prime Minister Sir John Major.

In Prime Minister's Questions today, Mr Cameron defended handing out knighthoods.

He said: 'I want a team that reflects modern Britain. I make no apology for saying I think in public life we should recognise public service.'

His remarks came after Labour's Jonathan Reynolds had asked: 'Can the Prime Minister now explain why he’s given more knighthoods to men that he’s sacked than he’s appointed women to the Cabinet?'

Labour MP Stephen Pound accused the Prime Minister of abusing his power.

He said: 'I’ve nothing against long-service medals but using honours to sweeten the pill of dismissal is an abuse.'

Sarah Champion, MP for Rotherham, added: 'David Cameron has now sacked and then knighted more men than he’s appointed women to the Cabinet.

'This patronage for the old boys’ club shows just how out of touch Cameron is. Dishing out honours and gongs as golden goodbyes to keep his sacked ministers happy not only undermines the honours process, but also shows yet again how the Prime Minister overlooks and forgets about women.'
