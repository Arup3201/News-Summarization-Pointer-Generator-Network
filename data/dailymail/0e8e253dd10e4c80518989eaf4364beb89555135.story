Big-oil backed Arctic researchers are advertising for a hardy soul to work for them as a polar bear spotter in Siberia, in a move panned by environmental campaigners as an attempt at 'greenwash'.

The Arctic Research and Design Center for Offshore Developments wants somebody to count the numbers of polar bears in the 20 to 25 different groups living around the ice-bound Kara Sea.

The project is a joint venture between Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft and ExxonMobil, the American multinational oil and gas corporation, to exploit fossil fuels locked beneath the Arctic ice.

Count me out... Arctic researchers backed by big-oil firms ExxonMobil and Rosneft are advertising for an individual or team to count polar bears in the Kara Sea, in a move green campaigners have panned as 'ironic'

For now, their research is concentrating around the sea off Siberia's frozen north-west coast. Well north of the Arctic Circle, it is covered by more than a metre of ice for most of the year.

The job advertised by Rosneft and ExxonMobil is part of a $3.2billion exploration programme to work out how best to exploit the Arctic's natural resources.

Surveys carried out by energy giants have shown that 6.2billion tons of oil and 14.6billion cubic metres of natural gas lie locked beneath the floor of the Kara Sea alone.

As well as counting bears, the person who wins the post will also be expected to place electronic monitoring collars on up to 20 adult females. They also need to take blood samples from the bears so that laboratory tests can be carried out later.

But only the brave and resilient need apply. Polar bears are one of the few mammals that will deliberately hunt humans for food.

Good eyesight is a must to spot the white bears against the icy background. Winter temperatures in the area plunge to minus 46หะก.

But although it includes working with animals for a species officially classified as 'vulnerable', the work may not suit conservationists.

Ben Ayliffe, the head of Greenpeace's Arctic campaign, called ExxonMobil and Rosneft's Arctic research project 'obvious greenwash'.

He said that their plan to hire a polar bear counter was 'ironic' given that the companies plan to drill in areas recognised as protected sites for the species.

'If you look at the deal struck by Rosneft and ExxonMobil the drilling blocks actually impinge on protected areas,' said Mr Ayliffe.

'In the Kara Sea the blocks that they will be drilling impinge on a supposedly protected Russian national park, an area that's supposed to be sacrosanct.

'In other regions they hope to drill later, one of the places - Wrangel Island - is actually a Unesco World Heritage site where polar bears breed.

'So it's ironic that they are advertising for polar bear spotters when they are actually planning to drill in the nursery for polar bears in the Arctic.'

Mr Ayliffe added: 'The clear motive is a very thin veneer of green respectability on probably the most reckless drilling operation anywhere in the world.

'[ExxonMobil] is the company responsible for the Exxon Valdez disaster, which it was the 25th anniversary of just yesterday.'

The aftermath of the Exxon Valdez disaster 25 years ago: If a similar incident was to happen in the remote and inaccessible waters of the Kara Sea, it would make that spill 'look like a picnic', said a Greenpeace spokesman

In that incident an Exxon-owned oil tanker bound for Long Beach, California, struck a reef off Prince William Sound, Alaska, and bled as much as 750,000 barrels of crude oil into the northern Pacific in just a few days.

Due to the inaccessibility of the region hampering clean-up efforts, the oil eventually covered 1,300 miles of coastline, and 11,000 square miles of ocean, blighting a crucial habitat for salmon, sea otters, seals and seabirds.

'If a spill happened up in the Kara Sea it would make the Exxon Valdez look like a picnic,' Mr Ayliffe said.

So remote is the Kara Sea that its ecosystem is still relatively clean compared to oceans in lower latitudes, but the World Wide Fund identifies overfishing and oil and gas development as severe threats.

In the Soviet era, it was also long a dumping ground for military and civilian nuclear waste.

The successful applicant will be chosen at the end of March, so the applications need to be sent soon.

MailOnline contacted ExxonMobil for comment, but had received no reply at the time of publication.
