Uncapped batsman Rilee Rossouw has been called up to replace the injured Quinton de Kock for South Africa's final two Tests against West Indies.

Rossouw has played nine one-day internationals and three T20 matches for his country and could make his debut at St George's Park on Boxing Day.

De Kock sustained an ankle ligament injury during the first Test, which the home side won by an innings and 220 runs, and is a doubt for the World Cup, which begins in February.

'Rilee has been knocking on the door for some time,' said selector Andrew Hudson to the Cricket South Africa website.

'He and Temba Bavuma shared a partnership of 343 at a run rate of almost four to the over in the recent winning series for South Africa A against Australia A.

'The fact that he has also recently represented the Proteas in both the limited overs formats means that he will integrate easily into the Proteas squad system.'
