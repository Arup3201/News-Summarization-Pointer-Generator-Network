He may have only been looking for a bit of attention, but this cheeky lion cub bit off more than he could chew when he nipped his father's bum.

The lion cub was trying to initiate a play fight with his father  Xerxes by jumping on his back at Seattle Woodland Park Zoo in Washington, USA.

But he took things one step too far by taking a quick bite, causing the fiery animal to let off an almighty roar.

The cub backed away with his tail between legs the cub and quickly bounded away to join his two brothers.

Photographer Scott Williams captured the play fighting and saw one of the curious cubs put his head into his father's mouth

All three cubs, Tandie, Gandia and Mandla, were later seen playing with their mother Adia in their enclosure.

Photographer Scott Williams captured the play fighting and said: 'They wrestled with both parents and tried to get rides on their backs.

'The cubs Tandie, Gandia and Mandla were playing and testing their hunting prowess when one suddenly bit Xerxes on the bum.

'The father did roar but the young cub didn't back off until a second much larger roar.

'A short time later they were lying next to each other watching mum doing her nails by clawing a tree.

'Fortunately mum Adia and dad Xerxes are great parents and teach their cubs new things daily.'
