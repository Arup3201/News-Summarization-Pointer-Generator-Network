Manchester City have never made an approach for Ross Barkley, according to Everton manager Roberto Martinez.

The England youngster was linked with a £60million move to the Premier League champions last summer with the Manchester Evening News even claiming the 20-year-old was 'the player City covet more than any other'.

However, Martinez - speaking ahead of his side's visit to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday - insisted that City have never made direct contact over the player he claims will become 'the best player England has ever had.'

'We have a great relationship with City. We signed Gareth Barry on loan from them and the relationship has always been good but there has never been an approach about Ross,' he said. 

'Never. Honestly, City are not trying to do that. Maybe if you are a selling club they could try that, but we are not a selling club.

'I think every game we play there is a link with one of our players. When we went to Wolfsburg it was Romelu Lukaku and when you go to another ground it is Kevin Mirallas.

'Ross doesn't care. He could play in the most intense game of football with the most intense atmosphere and the biggest meaning and all he sees is an enjoyment. That is the big attribute he has.'

Barkley, who turns 21 next week, has been sidelined by injury at the start of this campaign but Martinez says he is gradually returning to his best form. 

The 20-year-old has impressed despite Everton's recent run of poor results, including a 2-1 loss to Spurs

'I think he has improved massively. It is unfair to look at Ross's performances and blame our results on that,' he said, after seeing his side beaten 2-1 by Tottenham and then held to a 1-1 draw by Hull in the last week.  

'Can he improve? Of course he can because he is a young man who has all the potential in the world. I see massive improvement in certain areas from where he was last season and I think we are going to see the best Ross Barkley in the second half of the season.

'Preseason, before the injury, Ross was at his very best. Injury set him back and it stops you from getting the rhythm but after Christmas we are clearly going to see the best of Ross.'
