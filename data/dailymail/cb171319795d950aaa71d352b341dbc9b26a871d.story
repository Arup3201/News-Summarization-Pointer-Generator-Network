Stuart Pearce is excited about renewing an old rivalry when Nottingham Forest meet Tottenham in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night.

The Forest manager, who played for the Midlands club between 1985 and 1997, was involved in some high profile games with the north London side during his playing career.

But encounters between the two clubs have been few and far between since Forest were relegated in 1999, and Pearce is hoping to cause an upset against the Premier League side.

'It is a game with a lot of history, certainly in my playing days we had some great games,' Pearce told Sky Sports ahead of the game at White Hart Lane.

'It will be a special occasion because we had some fantastic games against them over the years, they are a fantastic side - one of the top five teams in the Premier League. It is a tough tie for us.

'But it is a game we should be looking forward to. Tottenham did very well at the City Ground and we seemed to do well at White Hart Lane. It is a massive game for the club and a great test for us, once again.'
