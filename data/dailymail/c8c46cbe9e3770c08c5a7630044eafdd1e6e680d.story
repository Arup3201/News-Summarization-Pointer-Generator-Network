'Nuts!' is a word often heard by defeated players on court at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, home of the U.S. Open in Flushing,New York.

But this little fella must have thought something similar as he was caught in a crossfire of tennis balls as he scampered across the court ...almost as fast as one of Rafael Nadal's serves.

Play began in the first day of the U.S. Open tennis championship with familiar faces all taking part for a shot at the title, the squirrel amongst them.

Scroll down for video

Are you nuts?! A squirrel crosses the court during the first round of play at the 2013 U.S. Open tennis tournament

Scurrying along: Half way across the court, the squirrel realised it might be mistaken for a ball and dashed on to the other side

Plucky: This most suicidal of moves has shot this squirrel to stardom

Matches were also disrupted last August when one of the furry rodents leaped across the court.

It only goes to prove that hare-brained ideas don't just come from the players.

It seems this nutty animal wanted to beg, burrow or steal a seat at the Open, come what may!

Perhaps in-training for a career in animal acting, the squirrel waited until the cameras were rolling to enact its daring move...

In an interview, when asked what the squirrel was thinking about, he simply responded: 'Nuttin!'

Regular visitor: It's not the first time the squirrel has been seen darting across the court at Flushing Meadows

Nutcase: The squirrel may well have the best seat in the house, but is in danger of being hit by low flying objects traveling at almost 100mph ...and we're not talking about nuts!
