Earth has had another close encounter with an asteroid.

Asteroid 2013 EC is between 10 to 17 metres wide - roughly the same size as the one which exploded above Russia's Ural mountains last month, injuring 1,000 people.

It was discovered on March 2, and passed between the moon and sun 246,000 miles away in the early hours of this morning.

Experts say the prediction is clear evidence we are getting better at predicting asteroids.

'That we are finding all these asteroids recently does not mean that we are being visited by more asteroids,' said Gianluca Masi from the Virtual Telescope Project.

'Just that our ability to detect them has gotten so much better.

'Our technology has improved a lot over the past decades.'

'Of course, we knew well there were no risks for our precious planet.

'Over the years, our ability to find these small asteroids increases, 
this is why we count more and more, as time goes.

'Hopefully, the surveys surfing the skies to find them will have 
better and better funding, as well as space missions to hunt for them 
from space and projects to mitigate any potential collision risk.

The asteroid identified as 2013 EC was discovered by Arizona's Mount Lemmon Observatory on Saturday.

Similar to the Russian meteor that hit two weeks ago, it passed Earth at an approximate distance of the moon's orbit Monday, Mar. 4, at 2:35 a.m. ET (7:35 a.m. UTC).

It is thought to be between 10-17 meters wide.

The Russian meteor was 17 meter wide with a mass of 10,000 tons before entering Earth's atmosphere.

More than a thousand people were injured as the sonic wave caused by the explosion collapsed roofs and shook buildings in the Ural region in Russia.

More than a hundred thousand asteroids have been discovered so far.

An asteroid Apophis, nicknamed as 
‘the doomsday asteroid’, was observed by the European ESA’s Herschel 
space observatory and a study claimed that there is 2.7 percent chance 
of it colliding with Earth.

But further studies dismissed this and claim that the asteroid will definitely not strike Earth in 2036.
