The dad of the four-year-old girl who went missing around 2:30am this morning wearing only purple tights said he is 'over the moon'.

In an interview with 9 News, father Robbie, from Loganlea, south of Brisbane, said the hours she had been missing were 'horrible, just horrible'. 

The little girl, who has not been named, hugged her father and nodded shyly when asked if she had been scared.
