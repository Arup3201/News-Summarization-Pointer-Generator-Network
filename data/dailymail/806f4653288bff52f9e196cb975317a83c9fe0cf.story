It's a country known for it's relaxed way of life - so much so, that citizens fiercely treasure the siesta tradition of napping during the day.

And now researchers believe that they have found a reason for Spain's sleepy stereotype - the country is in the wrong timezone, forcing its residents to rise an hour earlier than they they should.

A new parliamentary report blames the fact that Spain is stuck in Central European time - which means running one hour ahead of daylight - for everything from low work productivity to gender gaps.

The document by a parliamentary commission said that 'Spain for more than 71 years has not been in the correct time zone'

The time zone is unusual because the Mediterranean country sits in the middle of the Western European time zone, the one that Portugal, Morocco and Britain belong to, the BBC reported.

The report argues that Spaniards' sleeping patterns are based around the 'artificial' time zone, but their work hours follow the daylight time.

So citizens will work until the daylight begins to end, despite going to work an hour earlier, the Washington Post reported.

The report's authors recommend that the government move Spain's daylight hours to accord with the Western European time zone - which could see an improvement in work productivity and stress levels.

The document by a parliamentary 
commission said that 'Spain for more than 71 years has not been in the 
correct time zone', the BBC reported.

The reason for the country's peculiar time zone compared to their neighbours occured in 1942, the Spanish dictator General Franco moved Spain onto Central European Time to follow Nazi Germany.

Unlike the UK, which changes its clocks twice a year, Spain sticks to one time.

In the past American researchers have studied the impact of daylight saving on a person's health - and discovered that moving the clocks backwards and forwards can wreak havoc on the body.

In 2012 they found that the abrupt change to a person's daily schedule increased the risk of having a heart attack by 10 per cent.

This impact isn't felt on the Sunday morning as most people adapt their weekend schedule and rise a little later.

However, the risk peaks on Monday when workers have to get up at a set time to get to the office.

When the clocks go back in October the risk of heart attack decreases by 10 per cent.

'Exactly why this happens is not known but there are several theories,' said Professor Martin Young at the time.

'Sleep deprivation, the body's circadian clock and immune responses all can come into play when considering reasons that changing the time by an hour can be detrimental to someone's health.'
