Most new graduates lack even the basic skills needed for the workplace, complain major employers.

More than two-thirds of bosses said they cannot handle customers while half said they cannot operate independently.

Half of companies said university leavers struggle with basic English and nearly two-fifths claim they  cannot do simple maths.

'Superfluous: The Business Secretary pointed out professions where degrees do not seem to be of use

Many firms said jobseekers expected to ‘get rich quick’ after being ‘damaged’ by the instant fame culture created by reality TV and  talent shows.

Employers also complained that graduates were more interested in ‘what a job can do for them, not what they have to offer an employer’.

Deloitte, HSBC, BT and Tesco, as well as the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, were among 127 employers surveyed.

More than half were having difficulty filling vacancies and most will spend more on training to bring recruits up to standard.

But the research commissioned by BPP, which trains professionals, added that 91 per cent of firms were happy with applicants’ IT skills.

John Cridland, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said schools had become ‘conveyor belts’ with too little emphasis on wider skills and attitudes.

Lacking: The survey of 127 employers, included companies such as Tesco, and it found that many graduates lack basic skills

He said: ‘Rigorous standards are vital but there’s been too little emphasis on the wider skills and attitudes that employers demand.

‘Instead of trying to push students over the grade C line at GCSE, we need a system which prizes rounded and grounded young people.’

And Dr Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said broadening the workforce’s skills was a ‘priority’.

‘Businesses tell us they lack confidence in our education system’s ability to deliver basic literacy and numeracy skills,’ he added.

‘But employers also want to see young people with a strong worth ethic, and “softer” skills like timekeeping, and communication, which are fundamental in the work environment.

‘It’s essential that when young people leave the education system they have at least the basic skills that employers need.’

BPP chief executive Carl Lygo said the poll showed employers were looking for reliable staff who could immediately make a contribution to their business.

‘It seems that graduates and apprentices are keen and IT literate but that’s not enough. They need to be ready for the real world of work,’ he said.…
