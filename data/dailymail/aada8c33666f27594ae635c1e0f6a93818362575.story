The Ideal Home Show has been running since 1908 and the International Motor Show began in 1903 so it was only a matter of time before someone came up with a similar show and earlier this month the Beeches in Bournville, Birmingham played host to the first Ideal Death Show.

The event billed itself as a 'weekend gathering of entrepreneurs, pioneers and progressives from the funeral industry'.

Open to members of the public, the show allowed discussions about death, planning a funeral and some of the more eccentric ways people select to mark their own passing.

The show featured Death Cafés where people can speak honestly about their experiences of death and loss.

Among the odder stands was one that featured a model of a hearse as a motorbike sidecar, caskets made of wicker and also a Viking funeral where the coffin is placed in a Viking boat.

It also had a deathly version of the Great British Bake-Off, where cooks competed to make the most ghoulish cakes they could.

Ideal Death Show organiser Brian Jenner said: 'It's a great way to respond creatively to feelings of grief and sadness.

'It's also about restarting a tradition. In Yorkshire, funeral cakes tied with black crêpe were delivered to homes as invitations to funerals.

'Another Northern tradition is to bake a cake or biscuit specially to be eaten at funerals. The biscuits were traditionally decorated with a heart symbol to represent the soul of the deceased.'

Held from Friday to Sunday, on the second day the third annual Good Funeral Awards were held and an undertaker called Dyer was named Embalmer of the Year.

Robert Dyer, 65, beat off stiff competition and was presented with the funeral industry's equivalent of an Oscar, a statue in the shape of Anubis – the Egyptian god of embalming.

In addition to Best Embalmer, other categories included Best Alternative Hearse, Gravedigger of the Year and Crematorium Attendant of the Year.

Yesterday, Mr Dyer – who runs the family business A. Dyer – in Studley, Warks, said: 'I'm dead chuffed, to coin a phrase.

'I'm still on cloud nine even if it's come a bit late in life and we did open a bottle of champagne.

'It's a progressive business. It can be quite complex, requiring a knowledge of anatomy and diseases.

'Families always want the best, the clothing, hair and maybe make-up.

'I can't go into the nitty-gritty, but it can take two to four hours, sometimes longer.'

Father-of-one Mr Dyer beat off four finalists at the ceremony at The Beeches Hotel in Bournville, Birmingham.

His wife Christine, 56, said: 'We went to the dinner on the Sunday night because we were told he had made the shortlist.

'But we have no idea who nominated him and how he won. We cannot find out what the judging process was, it is very secretive.

'I think it must have gone on reputation but he is over the moon with the award.'

The firm was founded by Mr Dyer's father Alec and Robert joined straight from school 50 years ago.

He became a qualified embalmer in 1990 and now runs the firm with his brother Jim, 63, while Christine Dyer works as the office manager.

The couple's only son Tim, 31, is also a qualified embalmer after being taught by his father.

Mrs Dyer admitted that the family's surname was often met with laughter in the funeral industry.

She said: 'Especially as the business is 'A Dyer'.

'We've had plenty of jokes of the years, it's caused a lot of frivolity.'

Organiser Charles Cowling, who is also the author of The Good Funeral Guide, said the event swept away misconceptions about funeral industry workers.

He added: 'They're not weird, these great funeral people.

'They're wonderful. Above all, they're amazingly normal, just like us - kind, decent, friends in need.

'The world needs to know this. They richly deserve to have their praises sung. The event was where we got to do that.'
