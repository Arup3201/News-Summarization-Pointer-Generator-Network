 A group of 20 tourists were rescued from the Canadian Arctic
today following a miraculous stroke of luck.

The group had been trapped at sea on a 30 mile long ice sheet after it broke away from Baffin Island sometime between Monday night and early
Tuesday and floated out to sea.

But the ice sheet on which they had found themselves trapped
bumped into another ice sheet which was touching land earlier today, the Canadian
coast guard said.

Adrift: A group of 20 Canadian tourists was left stranded 2 miles from land when a 30-nmile long ice sheet they were camped on broke free from Baffin Island

The group managed to walk from one ice sheet to the other before reaching dry land,
the coastguard confirmed this afternoon.

‘Everyone is safe and sound,’ marine coordinator
Christian Cafiti told CNN.

A rescue plane had managed to drop survival kits onto the three
and half square-mile frozen sheet on Tuesday, after the group alerted
authorities to their plight. The kits included satellite phones, inflatable
rafts and food rations.

The plane kept a watch on the group while they waited for
helicopters to arrive.

But when the helicopters did arrived early on Wednesday, bad
weather prevented rescuers from hoisting the group on board. They have been
standing by to airlift them to an Arctic station ever since.

‘We are having regular conversations with them through
satellite phone,’ Mr Cafiti said.

The tourists do not appear to be in danger of exposure. They
are dressed warmly and have been able to remain dry, he added.

CNN reported Canadian air force spokesman Steven Neta as saying: ‘Ice breaking off is a very common thing at this time of
year.'

The floe drifted two miles away from land and started to
break up Mr Neta said.

Had it fallen apart, the three rubber rafts were more
than large enough to hold the whole group, he added.

Baffin Island is in the Canadian territory of Nunavut and is the largest island in Canada and the fifth largest island in the world.

It is 195,928 square miles in size and its population was estimated at 11,000 in 2007.

Baffin Island lies in the path of a generally northerly airflow all year round.

Winters tend to be very long and foggy while Spring thaw arrives later than normal given its position in the Arctic Circle usually not occurring until early June in the south or even as late as early to mid-July on the northern coast where glaciers run right down to sea level

Snow, even heavy snow, occurs at any time of the year, although is least likely in July and early August. Temperatures in Nunavut territory’s capital Iqaluit can hit a high of 9 degrees Celsius in July while the coldest month is February when temperatures can fall as low as -33 degrees Celsius.

Sea ice surrounds the island for most of the year and only disappears completely from the north coast for short unpredictable periods from mid to late June until the end of September.

Most of Baffin Island lies above the Arctic Circle and most of the communities that live on the island have Polar night in winter and the midnight sun in summer.

The north eastern community of Clyde River has twilight instead of night from April 26 until May 13, continuous sunlight for two and half months from May 14 to July 28, then twilight instead of night from July 29 until August 16. This gives the community just over three and a half months without true night. In the winter the sun sets on November 22 and does not rise again until January 19 of the next year. However, there is twilight for at least 4 hours a day.

The island is named after English explorer William Baffin, although it is likely that the island was known to Pre-Columbian Norse explorers from Greenland and Iceland.
