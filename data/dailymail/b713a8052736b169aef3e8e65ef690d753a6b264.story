A teacher braved the gym to hang on to her super-fit boyfriend - and just one year later she's joining him in the finals of the world bodybuilding championships.

Laura Potts, 25, from Cardiff, hated working out and had never lifted a dumbbell in her life before meeting muscle man Johnny Reid, also 25.

But after falling for Johnny she started gym sessions because it was her only chance of seeing him.

Laura said: 'Johnny trains three hours a day, seven days a week - he practically lives in the gym.

'He said the only way the relationship would work was if I had a go at bodybuilding too.'Â 

Now after a year of pumping Iron she is competing with Johnny in the World Amateur Body Building championship in Greece this summer.

But before that the gym buddies have an ever bigger event - they are getting married in Las Vegas.

Laura said: 'I was not into fitness and bodybuilding when I met Johnny a year ago.

'On the rare occasions that I did go to the gym I'd go straight for a McDonald's afterwards.

'But I wanted to spend more time with Johnny so I decided to join the gym and bodybuild with him.

'It wasn't easy to start with and the dedication required is immense - but I love Johnny so much and I will do anything for him.'

Laura and design engineer Johnny compete as a team and have already won two major body building titles.

They are both on strict diets of four boiled eggs for breakfast, nuts, egg and meat for lunch and protein pancakes for tea.

Laura drinks six litres of water a day and no alcohol or tea, coffee, fizzy drinks, dairy or wheat is allowed.

She says: 'Once a week we have a cheat night and will have burger and chips or a curry but other than that we keep strictly to our diet.'

Laura and Johnny are now hoping their choreographed routine - Go the Distance from the film Hercules - will win them Gold at the World Championships in Athens.

Laura said: 'We have a good chance of winning and we have to make sure we are in the best shape.

'I only took up bodybuilding to spend more time with the man I love but I don't regret a second of it.'

Laura said: 'The dedication required is immense - but I love Johnny so much and I will do anything for him.'
