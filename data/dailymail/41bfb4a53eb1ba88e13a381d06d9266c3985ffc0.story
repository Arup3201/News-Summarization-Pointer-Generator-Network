An Argentine governor has sparked outrage by firing half of his 340 public sector staff with a personal message - via YouTube.

Alberto Weretilneck has been dubbed ‘a coward’ for deciding to break the news of shattering job losses by video rather than meet those affected face-to-face.

The Rio Negro province governor posted a to-camera clip, explaining the move which he hopes will deal with budget shortfalls, online Tuesday night.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

‘I decided to decrease the number of public officials by 50 per cent,’ he said.

In a further bombshell he announced salary reductions for those that are staying.

He said: ‘And those who are continuing on in their jobs will have their salaries reduced by 15 per cent. I have signed the decree that terminates [employment of 140 officials] on Friday, January 31.'

Weretilneck
 also requested that directors of all of Rio Negro's public enterprises 
resign so he could place all of the firms under a single leadership.

In
 addition, he said he would ask for the wages of the provincial public 
advocate, senior prosecutors and auditor-general's office to be brought 
down to be in line with lawmakers and cabinet ministers.

As
 a sign he was also making a sacrifice for the public good, he also 
revealed he personally would no longer be collecting his official 
housing allowance.

‘We cannot 
be asking Río Negro citizens nor state workers to join us in this effort
 if the Executive branch does not show signs of austerity first,’ he 
added in the video.

Weretilneck, a member of the centre-left party Frente Grande, was sworn-in as governor two years ago.

The announcements came days after Argentina's national currency - the peso - was steeply devalued.

His delivery of the news has sparked outrage in the Patagonian province.

Many took to the YouTube page, where his message was posted, to vent their anger. Many of the comments, however, are too rude to repeat.
