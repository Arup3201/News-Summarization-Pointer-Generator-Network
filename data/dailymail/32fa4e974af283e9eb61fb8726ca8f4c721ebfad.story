Los Angeles Clippers owner and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has revealed that he has banned his players from using Apple products.

The businessman, thought to be worth around $20billion, made it clear this week that he would not tolerate his NBA stars using technology produced by his former competitors.

With iPhones and iPads now strictly off limits - some players may have to start figuring out how to use devices made by Microsoft.  

Banned: Steve Ballmer (pictured exhibiting Microsoft smartphones in Las Vegas last year) has insisted that his players at LA Clippers will not be using iPhones or iPads 

Mr Ballmer said: 'Most of the Clippers are on Windows, some of the players and coaches are not.

Referring to the team coach, Glenn Rivers, he added: 'And Doc kind of knows that's a project. It's one of the first things he said to me - "We are probably going to get rid of these iPads, aren't we?"

'And I said, "Yeah, we probably are." But I promised we would do it during the off season.'

The mobile experience is something Mr Ballmer knows intimately and he acknowledges that under his leadership at Microsoft it was something he did not get right 

The 58-year-old left the board last month amid mounting pressure to innovate and compete with Apple and Google's dominance of the mobile phone market.

He had been CEO for 14 years and is still the largest individual shareholder, with about four per cent of the company - worth $15.7billion.

He added: 'Do I wish a higher percentage of today's mobile devices were ours and we had birthed that category? Yes, of course I do.'

This season Microsoft paid $400 million to put its Surface tablets in the hands of every prominent NFL coach and player on the sidelines.

The company is now facing a battle to stop people referring to all tablets universally as iPads and wants to educate the NFL's television announcers so that they stop making the mistake.

Mr Ballmer bought the LA Clippers for $2billion in August this year and claims his side are ready to bring something different to the NBA this season.

He is renowned for his energy and exuberance and has relentlessly spoken about 'the fan experience' in the build up to the new season.

He said: 'I think people understand we are a different kind of team. 

'We are born in a funny way, and the guys have all had to live through something not only on the court but off the court together that requires a deeper kind of commitment.'

Despite his confidence, the man who helped sell personal computing to the masses knows he has to sell a team that has long been overlooked and overshadowed by its more famous L.A. rival, the Lakers. 

Mr Ballmer promises that whether fans come to the arena, or cheer from the couch, or follow on a smartphone or tablet they 'are going to have the best experience and that is not just the best in L.A'.
