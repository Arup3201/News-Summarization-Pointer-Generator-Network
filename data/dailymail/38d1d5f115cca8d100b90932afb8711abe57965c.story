Cosmetics giant L'Oreal has severed ties with the Belgian World Cup fan who won a modelling contract after being spotted in the crowd after it emerged she is a fan of big game hunting.

Axelle Despiegelaere, 17, caught the world's attention after being photographed cheering on her national team in the Group H match against Russia - with the image widely shared online.

But L'Oreal has confirmed that the modelling contract it awarded her as a result of her new-found fame has already been cancelled after a photo emerged of the teenager posing with a rifle and a dead animal in Africa.

Discovered: 17-year-old Axelle Despiegelaere won a contract to model for L'Oreal after this image of her at the World Cup went viral. But after photographs of her hunting emerged, the cosmetics firm ended the relationship

As a result of her appearance during the World Cup, Despiegelaere landed a contract to star in a L’Oréal Professionnel Belgique social media campaign, including a 'hair tutorial' video.

But within days of the announcement it emerged she is a fan of big game hunting, with a photograph her Facebook page showing her posing with a rifle and the bloodied corpse of a large Gemsbok antelope.

The image was reportedly accompanied with the caption: 'Hunting is
 not a matter of life or death. It's much more important than that.'

Now L'Oreal - which is keen to promote itself as sympathetic to animal welfare concerns - has decided to end its association with Despiegelaer.

Speaking to The Independent, the cosmetics giant said: 'L’Oréal Professionnel Belgium collaborated with her on an ad hoc basis to produce a video for social media use in Belgium. The contract has now been completed.'

Well-liked: After returning home to Belgium, Axelle set up a professional Facebook which has now been 'liked' over 200,000 times

The L'Oreal spokesperson added that, although the brand was aware of the 
photograph of the hunting trip, it would not comment on whether it led to the decision to sever ties with Despiegelaere.

They were keen to 
stress, however, that L'Oréal 'no longer tests on animals, anywhere in the world, 
and does not delegate this task to others.'

L'Oreal
 has long promoted itself as sensitive to animal welfare concerns.

In 2012 the company donated $1.2million to the
 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to help improve the testing of 
safe chemicals.

In
 the photo which scored Despiegelaere her modelling contract she doned red, yellow and 
black face paint and a horned hat.
