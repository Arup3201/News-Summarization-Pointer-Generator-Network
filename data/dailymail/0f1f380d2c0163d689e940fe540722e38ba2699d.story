Two guards have been placed on leave during 
investigations into the suicide of Cleveland kidnapper and rapist Ariel 
Castro, officials said today. 

Department of Rehabilitation and Correction spokeswoman JoEllen Smith
says the two guards Caleb Ackley, 26, and 27-year-old Ryan Murphy were on duty in the Orient, Ohio prison unit where Castro hanged
himself on September 3.

The two are on paid administrative leave until 
internal investigations by the department and a criminal investigation 
by the state highway patrol are completed.

Suicide: The two corrections officers who were guarding Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro have been placed on administrative leave following his death on their watch at the Ohio prison

The end: Castro acknowledged in court last month that he would die in prison

Mr Ackley and Mr Murphy both joined the agency in 2007 and neither has ever been disciplined.

The officers haven't been found guilty of
any wrong doing but are on leave pending the review board's decision, 
according to 19 Action News.

Messages were left for the union representing prison guards. There was no response from Mr Ackley when contacted by MailOnline.

The 53-year-old Castro hanged himself with a bed sheet earlier this 
month, a few weeks into a life sentence for imprisoning three women in his home for a decade.

Castro was serving a life sentence plus 1,000 years for abducting, raping, and holding hostage Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus.

comment on his suicide

Castro was being housed alone in an isolation unit for his protection, where he would be checked every 30 minutes.  Prison officials said he hanged himself with a sheet during a break between inspections.

Initially, Castro was being checked on every ten minutes, but this stopped in June after he was deemed not to be a risk to himself and taken off suicide watch.

An autopsy confirmed his death was suicide by hanging.

Castro's attorneys tried 
unsuccessfully to have an independent psychological examination of the 
53-year-old done at the Cuyahoga County Jail before he was turned over 
to state authorities following his conviction.

A
full investigation is underway as to how he was able to take his own 
life while under the watchful eye of prison guards - who said he was 
always calm and cooperative with them.

Lonely death: This is an isolation cell at Correctional Reception Center in Orient, Ohio, like the one where Castro hanged himself on September 3

House of horrors: This is the four-bedroom home where Castro kept his victims for a decade - unbeknown to his family or his neighbors
