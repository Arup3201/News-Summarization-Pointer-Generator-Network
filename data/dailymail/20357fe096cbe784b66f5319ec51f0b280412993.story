Riot squads were sent into Calais last night after UK-bound migrants turned the French port into a ‘war zone’.

Anarchy broke out when 250 men burst into the town’s docks and tried to board vessels sailing for Dover.

One gang of marauders broke through gates and climbed over fences in a  desperate bid to reach a ferry.

Detained: Witnesses said the crowds attempted to overpower officials and machine-gun wielding police by climbing over fences and running up the main ramp into the ferry's vehicle hold

Brushing off pursuing police officers,
 the migrants stopped only when the ship’s crew turned a fire hose on 
them and pulled up the car ramps.

The
 mayor of Calais last night begged David Cameron to come to Calais to 
tell the waiting hordes that Britain was ‘no El Dorado’. Natacha 
Bouchart said the UK was too soft on migrants.

In a day of drama:

Dramatic
 film of Wednesday’s storming of the port was posted on YouTube by a 
British lorry driver who watched from his cab as up to 100 mainly 
Eritrean men ran toward him at full tilt.

‘Looks like loads of immigrants have managed somehow to get into the port,’ says Mark Salt on his video footage.

Sirens can be heard blaring and a van appears as Mr Salt says: ‘Police have just turned up to try to rein them all in – but there’s loads of them.’

Shocking: Security staff were forced to turn a fire hose on the crowds as they attempted to overpower officials and run up the main ramp into the ferry's vehicle hold

Run for it: There were two attempts to storm the ferry yesterday - the first by 90 immigrants, who forced their way through a gate and then over a fence before the ferry's crew were able to raise the ramp in time

Brazen: Witnesses said the immigrants were not intimidated by police with machine guns guarding the entrance to the ferry, casually running past them as they attempted to force their way on board

Footage has also emerged which is believed to show migrants trying to board a lorry headed for Calais

The mob jump over a wall to escape pursuing police and stream past more officers to head for the Berlioz, a MyFerryLink vessel, where they are finally stopped.

Another lorry driver Lee Croson told ITV: ‘It’s more like a war zone than it used to be. If you get into Calais or park anywhere in Calais you can be 99 per cent sure you will get the immigrants in your trailer.’

He said many drivers are threatened at knifepoint. Anywhere within three hours drive of the port is considered a risk, he added, saying he had not known a worse situation in 20 years.

If a trucker is caught with migrants in his vehicle it is the driver, not the company, who is liable for a £2,000 fine. The chaotic scenes recall the early 2000s when migrants repeatedly tried to storm the entrance to the Channel Tunnel.

Jean-Marc Puissesseau, of the Calais Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which runs the port, said: ‘The situation is unacceptable, the port is under siege.

‘I demand that the forces of law and order have a permanent presence at the port as quickly as possible.

Mass: The incident took place yesterday afternoon, with P&O Ferries confirming that a 'huge intrusion'

Sprint: A second attempt involving 150 individuals took place a short time later, with police able to block their path and detain them - again before they made it up the ferry's ramp (pictured in background)

‘It is out of order what is going on. If it is not sorted out we must close the port.’

The crisis comes in the week that thousands of Britons are returning from holidays on the Continent, causing congestion on roads around Calais.

The slow traffic will help migrants determined to board UK-bound lorries which are forced to slow.

Despite the extra police drafted in, hundreds of migrants at the sprawling camp close to the port vowed to continue their bid to reach Britain.

An estimated three million freight lorries, two million cars and 12million passengers pass through Calais to Dover every year.

Witness: Ferry passenger John Bailey said: 'The migrants were escorted back down the ramp by the police and led out of the port, shouting at some people in the vehicle queue'

A MyFerryLink spokesman said: ‘Several
 migrants entered the port and attempted to board Berlioz. The crew took
 immediate action to ensure the ship’s security and the attempt was 
unsuccessful.’

The captain of a P&O ferry, Spirit of Britain, coming into Calais saw what was happening and held back from docking.

Fed up: Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart said she would block the port if it was legal to do so

A P&O spokesman said last night: ‘We approached the port and witnessed all the migrants.

‘Our crew remained just in the inner harbour and didn’t tie up until we were able to do so.’ Police said all the migrants were rounded up, before being returned to the other side of security fences.

Passengers had earlier told of seeing a large crowd of migrants on the main access to the port road being guarded by French police, some armed with sub-machine guns, before they burst in around 4.15pm.

‘This was clearly no deterrent as they obviously ran past them into the port, which must have been a distance of about a mile,’ said one witness.

A Border Force spokesman in the UK said: ‘The incident was quickly brought under control and the French police apprehended all those involved.

‘All freight vehicles inside the port at the time have been rescreened by Border Force.’

In April the Daily Mail reported how four migrants were killed in one week trying to get aboard UK-bound trucks.

P&O spokesman Chris Lamming told the Daily Mail: ‘The migrants are clearly desperate and will try anything to get on board a ferry.’

More French police have been drafted in by the authorities.
