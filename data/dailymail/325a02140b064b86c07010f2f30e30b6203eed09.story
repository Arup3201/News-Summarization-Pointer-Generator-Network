Millions of motorists face a 'spy in the cab' offensive by police using a secret unmarked lorry to catch drivers who text and phone at the wheel.

Thousands are expected to be prosecuted after it starts patrolling motorways and A-roads this spring.

A police driver and an officer with a video camera sitting high above the traffic will be on the look-out for offenders who cannot usually be seen from ground level.

A support team of two police motorcyclists and a marked police car in constant touch with the juggernaut will drive nearby to help gather evidence.

Offences to be targeted include texting or phoning while driving, speeding, hogging the middle or outside lane, drink or drug driving, driving without care, and failing to wear a seat belt.

Police will deal with the errant drivers through 'enforcement and education' including 'words of advice, driver education courses, fixed penalty notices or summons to court'.

The decision follows a three-month trial last year in five police areas – Surrey, Hampshire, Sussex, Thames Valley and Warwickshire – in conjunction with the Highways Agency. Codenamed Operation Tramline, it led to the detection of 462 offences.

The new scheme will cover England's major motorways and strategic roads used daily by more than four million drivers. The aim is to tackle those offenders who are not spotted by conventional static speed cameras.

Crackdown: Offences to be targeted include texting or phoning while driving, speeding and drink driving

The Highways Agency has paid MAN Trucks for the hire of the unmarked lorry cab, which will be sent around the 45 police forces in England. 

The agency said: 'The vehicle provided an ideal viewing platform for officers to observe drivers' actions from a high vantage point while out on the road.

'The unit enables the police to observe and record poor and dangerous driving behaviour using a video camera. The pilot was very successful at identifying unsafe driving behaviour.

'The aim of extending the project to a national initiative is not revenue generation but to improve driver behaviour and hence safety on the motorway network.'

Officials said the original objective had been to use the raised seating position of the HGV cab to focus on dangerously driven lorries, but police quickly realised its usefulness for spotting other offences being committed.

The Highways Agency spokesman said: 'Car drivers' texting while driving are not easy to identify from police patrol vehicles but the elevated seating position makes this offence much easier to see.'

Sergeant Chris Schultze from Surrey's Roads Policing Unit, which led the trials, said: 'Drivers continue to put themselves and others at risk. We have been looking for things like drivers who are not in proper control of the vehicle, if they are doing anything that is distracting them. It's been a massive success.'

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'Police will literally be looking down on drivers to check they are concentrating on the road and not being distracted by the latest message on their phone.

'Motorways are our safest roads but given the speeds involved and the mix of traffic, when things go wrong the results can be serious. Rooting out bad and anti-social behaviour is important. Now motorists tempted to break the law are likely to have traffic officers peering right over their shoulders.'

Using a hand-held mobile while driving has been illegal for a decade and is subject to three penalty points and a £100 fine, rising to a possible £1,000 on conviction in court. But Government figures show the number of accidents in which mobile phones and texting have been contributory factors has soared by 21 per cent in only three years.
