Sir Alex Ferguson has heaped praise on Manchester United's bitter rivals Liverpool for their astonishing Premier League form in 2013-14 - describing the Reds as the 'team of the year'.

Brendan Rodgers' side narrowly missed out on the Premier League title to Manchester City after rising from seventh the season before to finish runners-up in the last campaign.

And Ferguson, writing in the updated chapters of his autobiography, admits he thought the Merseysiders were the standout side in the land.

Ferguson even goes as far as to say Manchester United fans could not 'begrudge' Liverpool their rise

* I spoke to Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra about their Manchester United futures... but dressing-room was out of bounds

* I tried to convince David Moyes to keep Mike Phelan as Manchester United assistant manager

*Louis van Gaal is formidable... and he and Ryan Giggs can learn from each other  

*Manchester United were not in decline when I left... David Moyes was sacked because his team were too slow 

*I had nothing to do with David Moyes' sacking from Manchester United... I found out by reading the paper 

*I hope that before I die someone can explain the 'West Ham way'... I never came up against a Hammers side who played football I was afraid of

Their style of attacking football particularly impressed the 72-year-old former Red Devils boss. 

'From my perspective they (Liverpool) were definitely the team of the year,' writes Ferguson, who retired in May 2013 after 26-and-a-half highly-successful years at Old Trafford.

'They made their leap forward the right way: they played positive football.'

The outstanding finishing of star striker Luis Suarez - who netted 31 league goals last year before moving to Barcelona for £75million - helped Liverpool to the brink of the title before they were pipped by City.

Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling were also in imperious form for Rodgers' men, helping to make them one of the most feared attacking sides in Europe as the Anfielders bagged more than 100 Premier League goals.

And Ferguson believes that such an exciting brand of football meant even United fans could not resent Liverpool enjoying last season's success.

He continues in the new edition of My Autobiography, extracts of which were published on Tuesday, by stating: 'Even a United fan, seeing them as the nemesis, couldn't begrudge Liverpool their surge up the table - their form was amazing, brilliant.'
