The woman who falsely accused three Duke lacrosse players of raping her in 2006 has been found guilty of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of her boyfriend.

Crystal Mangum, 35, was sentenced to between 14 and 18 years in prison for killing Reginald Daye, 46.

The former stripper and mother-of-three stabbed her boyfriend in the side of his chest during a fight at Daye's apartment on April 3, 2011.

Daye died 10 days later at Duke Hospital due to complications from his injuries but managed to speak to police before his death.

The verdict: Former stripper and mother-of-three Crystal Mangum is told she will spend a minimum of 14 years in prison for the stabbing murder of her boyfriend, Reginald Daye, in 2011

Crystal Mangum was found guilty of second-degree murder on Friday by a court in Durham, North Carolina. In 2006, Mangum shot to notoriety as the stripper who accused three Duke Lacrosse players of raping her at a party where she had been paid to perform

While Mangum claimed she stabbed Daye in self defense after he dragged her out by the hair out of the bathroom, Daye told investigators she  Mangum attacked him several times with knives before stabbing him in the chest, according to News & Observer.

Victim: Crystal Mangum was found guilty of the second-degree murder of her boyfriend Reginald Daye (pictured) whom she stabbed in his apartment during an argument in 2011

It took the jury six hours to deliberate.

Deputies immediately led Mangum out of the courtroom in handcuffs following the announcement of her sentence.

Her attorneys had hoped for a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.

The jury found Mangum not guilty of larceny for allegedly stealing cashier’s checks totaling $700 that Daye had previously given her to pay the rent.

Members of Daye’s family said they were satisfied with the verdict.

'We’re just grateful that justice was served for Reggie today, for his family and his friends,' his sister, Cynthia Wilson, said.

'We just thank everybody that played a part and thank God. We’re just happy.'

In 2006, Mangum claimed Duke lacrosse players Reade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty and Dave Evans gang raped her at a team party where she was hired as a stripper.

The three men were arrested but eventually declared innocent by North Carolina's attorney general after the evidence failed to back up Magnum's inconsistent story and her mental stability was called into question.

The district attorney who championed Mangum's claims was later disbarred.

North Carolina's attorney general eventually declared the players innocent of a 'tragic rush to accuse'.

Prosecutors declined to press charges for the false accusations, but Mangum's bizarre legal troubles continued.

Not long after she was convicted on misdemeanor charges of setting a fire that nearly razed her home with her three children inside.

Crystal Mangum - seen here following her arrest in April 2011 - maintained she had stabbed boyfriend Reginald Daye in self-defense, with her attorneys hoping for a voluntary manslaughter verdict

In a videotaped police interrogation, she told officers she set got into a confrontation with her boyfriend at the time - not Daye - and burned his clothes, smashed his car windshield and threatened to stab him.

Friends said Mangum has never recovered from the stigma brought by the lacrosse case and has been involved in a string of questionable relationships in an attempt to provide stability for her children.

Vincent Clark, a friend who co-authored Mangum's self-published memoir, said: 'I'm sad for her. I hope people realize how difficult it is being her.'
