 'Jihadi John', the ISIS terrorist believed to be from England, may have been on drugs or suffering from stress when he beheaded British hostage David Haines.

A scientific analysis of his speech in the video that shocked the world has raised the possibility that the killer was on khat - an illegal class C herbal stimulant popular among the Somali community in the UK - or amphetamines when the video was recorded.

He speaks slower and at a slightly higher pitch than he does in the earlier footage when he kills two American hostages, according to an audio analyst. He also has an accent from the south-west of England.

'Jihadi John', the ISIS terrorist believed to be from England, may have been on drugs or suffering stress when he beheaded British hostage David Haines, it has been revealed

Khat is used by jihadists in Yemen and Somalia and there is evidence to suggest ISIS fighters take speed to heighten their combat skills and stave off exhaustion.

The audio expert told The Times that the man's 'distinctive speech patterns' could indicate he is on khat.

He added: 'It was not possible to establish whether some of these factors derived from rote learning (the speech) or whether there were other physiological or psychological factors involved.'

The Haines video also features a second male voice who either says 'Danny' or 'damn him' and the analysis also indicates it was edited and produced by someone other than the person who did the murders of the two Americans, James Foley and Steven Sotloff.

Alan Henning, from Eccles, Salford, could be the ISISexecutioner's next victim. He was snatched by brutal  militants while attempting to deliver aid in Syria.

The 47-year-old  was seen in a more recent video, where 'Jihadi John' was threatening to behead the aid worker.

On Tuesday it emerged that IS were 'tipped off' about his aid mission to Syria and seized him just half an hour after he entered the country.

Security services are now investigating whether IS fighters were tipped off about the convoy by corrupt local officials or an insider after it emerged the British taxi driver was seized just 30 minutes after he entered Syria.

Alan Henning (circled), from Eccles, Salford, could be the ISIS executioner's next victim. He was snatched by brutal militants while attempting to deliver aid in Syria.

The British aid worker was just four miles from the Turkish border when he was taken after militants were reportedly made aware of his arrival.

Muslim aid worker Pervez Abdullah Rafiq, who travelled with Mr Henning on previous trips to deliver aid to Syria, yesterday issued a video plea to the leader of Islamic State to release him.

In the video Mr Rafiq says: 'Your prisoner Alan Henning travelled with us several times to Syria. On all occasions, we your Muslim brothers, brought him with us under our care and protection.'

He pleads that Mr Henning should not pay 'for the crimes that international governments have committed' with his life.

Mr Rafiq recalls how Alan Henning devoted 'all his free time' to raising awareness of the suffering of Syrian children and washed cars to raise money for them.

He also describes how Mr Henning chose to sleep in the van on the journey to Syria rather than pay for a hotel, to avoid spending money that would otherwise go to the people of Syria.
