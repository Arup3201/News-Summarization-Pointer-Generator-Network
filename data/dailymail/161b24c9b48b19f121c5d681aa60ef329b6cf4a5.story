She is the Houston Texans fan who was delighted to be photographed with NFL player Arian Foster.

But after tweeting the picture, Jenni Bazard found out it wasn't him at all.

Despite being ridiculed by sports fans on social media, Miss Bazard has had the last laugh.

The footballer went to meet Miss Bazard this week so she could have a photograph with the real him.

Can the real Arian Foster please stand up: The NFL player posed for this photo with Jenni Bazard

Afterwards he tweeted: 'For being such a good sport about the whole thing, I met up with @j__baz and gave her a picture with the real me.'

The embarrassment began when Miss Bazard posted a photo of herself with the running back only to discover the man in the photo was actually a celebrity lookalike.

Miss Bazard posed with the man at Pub Fiction in Houston at the start of April and shared the image the next day.

'Ran into @ArianFoster at Pub Fiction last night! So blessed to get a picture with one of my favourite #HoustonTexans!!' Bazard tweeted.

It wasn't me! Foster was quick to let Bazard know he wasn't actually the man photographed

Foster seemed touched by the post, but quickly let her know it wasn't actually him.

'Lol I appreciate the love but that's not me,' he tweeted at Bazard.

Though Bazard's mistake has already gone viral, she told KHOU that she took it in stride.

'When Arian Foster re-tweeted me and said that’s not him and then how many tweets I was getting after that, I was like "Oh what do I do? What do I do?"

'But I was in the car with my best friend and she was like, "You know there’s two ways you can do this. You can run and hide or you can go with it." Then I was like you know what, it’s really funny, really embarrassing, but really funny, so you know people are gonna take a stab at it anyway whether or not I take it down, it’s already up there.'

Inspiration: Foster shared this message on Twitter before a fan criticized him

Final swing: Foster posted this humorous tweet in response to the fan's criticism

Foster's interaction with Bazard wasn't the only humorous exchange he had on Twitter that weekend.

He tweeted an inspirational message that said: 'Luckily knowledge doesn't go anywhere. It's always there for the humble and hungry.'

One of Foster's follower's criticised the post, writing: 'You're not a philospher bro. Seriously. You're a running back.'

Foster quickly wrote a witty reply making fun of the fan's request.

'Me run fast. All day long. Yards. Touchdowns. Me catch ball. Run with ball to square space on grass. Make big guys miss,' he wrote.
