Diego Maradona claims Fifa officials banned him from seeing his beloved Argentina win their opening World Cup game against Bosnia.

The 1986 World Cup legend tried to get into the Maracana on Sunday to see the 2-1 victory, but was forced to watch the game from his hotel after being told he was not allowed access.

Maradona puts it down to the 'ill will' of tournament officials, and wants to resolve the issue before Argentina face Iran in their second game on Saturday.

Not this time: Maradona was not allowed in and did not see Lionel Messi score in the flesh for Argentina

‘I was not allowed to go in to the game so I had to return to the hotel to see the second half,' Maradona told the Argentinian channel TyC Sports.

‘I did everything I could but they would not let us in. Someone just said no, it could not happen, so I had to watch it on TV.

‘Hopefully we will get this resolved because I want to go and see Argentina in several more games.

‘It is one thing to not be able to go to a game, and another to not be allowed to go.

'When
 there is good will, you’re allowed in but when there is ill will, it’s 
better to forget it and head back to the hotel, which it’s what we did.’

Next up, Alejandro Sabella's Argentina take on Iran as they look to move further forward to qualifying for the last 16.
