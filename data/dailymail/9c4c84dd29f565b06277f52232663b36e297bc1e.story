Maverick: When Maryland Congressman Roscoe Bartlett was voted out of office last year, he retired to his remote West Virginia compound sitting on 153 acres of land to live out his days off the grid.

Former Congressman Roscoe Bartlett has swapped his suit and tie for a pair of denim overalls and retreated into the dense woods of West Virginia, where he has been living off the grid in preparation for natural or man-made doomsday.

Bartlett, a small-government, Tea Party-style Republican, had spent two decades as the U.S. representative for Maryland's 6th congressional district. 

In 2013, he was voted out of office and replaced with Democrat John Delaney thanks to the process of gerrymandering.

Over the course of his career in public service, Bartlett used his status as a U.S. congressman to sound the alarm about the vulnerability of the American power grid, Politico Magazine reported in a lengthy profile. 

Speaking on the House floor, Bartlett prophesied that if the U.S. failed to act, an attack on the electrical system would plunge the nation into darkness and chaos: imagine the New York City blackout of 2004 stretched over six months or longer.

Bartlett's warnings of catastrophic electromagnetic pulse attacks and solar flares fell on deaf ears and earned him a reputation as a crank.

But when the 87-year-old politician left office last year, he decided to practice what he preached by going off the grid.

Bartlett and his wife, Ellen, retired to their remote West Virginia retreat to live out their days almost entirely independent of the system.

The lakeside compound made up of five solar-powered cabins - with a sixth under construction - is nestled in a wooded area on a 4,000-foot elevation four hours from Washington DC.

Bartlett bought the 153-acre property back in 1980 for $80,000 and has spent the past three decades improving the amenities built to house his 10 adult children and their families in case of a doomsday scenario.

The bucolic property boasts a manmade lake with a pair of swans, saw and flour mill, and several vegetable gardens.

In the fall, Bartlett was still in the process of building another cabin, which will feature a large kitchen, composting toilets, a root cellar - and even Internet access via satellite. 

Every couple of weeks, the survivalist octogenarian shaves off his white beard, dons a suit and heads to the capital, where he serves as a senior consultant for a cybersecurity company called Lineage Technologies.

Back home in West Virginia, Bartlett spends up to 12 hours tending to his vast property: cutting logs, gardening and making needed repairs.

Despite his advanced age, Bartlett, a vegetarian, is reportedly in excellent health only slightly marred by arthritis and acid reflux. But his old-age ailments do not stop from rising before dawn six days a week.

The son of a farmer, Bartlett said he learned everything he needed to build his rustic refuge while growing up in western Pennsylvania during the Great Depression.

He completed his early education in a one-room schoolhouse and went on to earn his bachelor's degree in theology and biology from Columbia Union College (now Washington Adventist University) in Maryland.

Bartlett continued his studies, earning a master's degree and PhD in physiology, and embarking on a career as a college professor.

The young scientist later switched gears, working for IBM and serving as a U.S. Navy engineer before becoming director of the Space Life Sciences research group at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, where he helped the U.S. defeat the Soviets in the space race.

When he was elected to Congress in 1980, Bartlett stood out among Republicans and got a reputation for being quirky and eccentric: he espoused libertarian values long before the emergence of the Tea Party and advocated for going green years before it was cool.

As a staunch opponent of big government, Bartlett voted against minimum wage increases and against extending financial help to the cash-strapped Postal Service.

With virtually no support from his party, Bartlett pushed Congress to allocate billions of dollars to harden America's power grid so it could withstand an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack by an enemy armed with a warhead capable of wreaking havoc on the nation’s infrastructure.

But to Bartlett’s chagrin, his colleagues on the Hill ignored his warnings, instead choosing to focus on more pressing matters.

‘If an event is going to end life as you know it, how can you say it’s too expensive?’ he told the magazine. ‘It is an absolute certainty it’ll happen.’
