Two party-goers have died after taking a lethal cocktail of drink and the former legal high drug 'bubble' during an 'all nighter' with friends.

Emma Johnston, 21, and Chris Goodwin, 30, were taken ill after taking a mixture of alcohol, amphetamine and mephedrone - otherwise known as 'bubble' - on Saturday night.

Police and paramedics were called to two houses within the space of half an hour the following afternoon but the pair were already dead.

Victims: Chris Goodwin, 30, left, and Emma Johnston, 21, who died after taking a mixture of alcohol, amphetamine and mephedrone on Saturday night

Three other friends were treated in hospital after taking a combination of drink and drugs.

The double deaths occurred after Emma and Chris joined a group of housemates who decided to have an 'all night' Saturday night out in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

It is believed the party met up at a house and started taking the drugs before they headed off to pubs and clubs. The group then fell ill after going their separate ways at the end of the night.

The alarm was raised at 1.30pm on Sunday after Emma was found at a house in Farnworth. Half an hour later officers were also called to a house five miles away in Tonge Moor, Bolton, and found father-of-one Chris dead.

Post-mortem examinations and toxicology tests are due to be carried out to establish the exact cause of death.

Greater Manchester Police Superintendent Phil Davies said: 'The message is don't take drugs, they don't come with a quality seal of approval on them, or if you do don't mix them.

Father-of-one Chris Goodwin, 30, was described as a 'top guy living life in the fast lane he doted on his son'

'This group of housemates decided to have an all night get together and had quite a cocktail of alcohol, amphetamines and bubble. We believe they started to take it at home first but went in pubs and clubs around the town centre.

'Some of the people involved are housemates - some are friends of the housemates

'The group of friends socialised together they have gradually drifted back to each others houses. All five have been poorly and two turned very ill on Sunday morning.

â€˜Ambulances were called to two separated house and tragically the deceased were found by the ambulance crews. The other three persons were taken to hospital but are fine.

'We don't know if we have a contaminated batch of illegal drugs or whether the cocktail of drink and drugs caused the issues as the mixture has the potential to make you very ill.

'These deaths are not being treated as suspicious. It appears to be an isolated incident. We are not looking for anyone else in connection within terms of supply.

'Bubble is a white powder or tablet, we don't know how much they had. Amphetamines is either a powder or liquid but we don't know what they took.'

Today tributes were paid to Emma and Chris on Facebook.

Angelina Bell said: 'Just to put everyone straight Chris was a top guy living life in the fast lane he doted on his son and was very anti drugs.

'Whatever u read he was loved by everyone and has a lot of friends and family that loved him we are all in shock he made a mistake and has paid the ultimate price.

'He wouldn't have wanted to leave his son that he loved with all his heart and I hope the angels are looking after him I'm sure he, ll be watching over his boy always r.I.p my beautiful cousin no more words can Express how we are all gonna miss u in this life.'
