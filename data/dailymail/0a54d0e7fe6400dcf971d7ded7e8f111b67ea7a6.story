Sunderland have made a bold request to take Barcelona starlet Alen Halilovic on loan.

Halilovic, the 18-year-old Croatia international midfielder, only moved to Spain in the summer and signed for Barca B, who compete in the Segunda Liga.

Barcelona are ready to send teenage midfielder Alen Halilovic out on loan in January

Coaching staff believe Halilovic is already too good for that level and are considering loaning him out in January.

Sunderland and Celta Vigo have made contact and Barcelona will ponder what is best for the player. 

Experienced defender Anthony Reveillere could be set to join Sunderland on a free transfer

Halilovic had been courted by Manchester United, Real Madrid and Tottenham among others and has been compared to compatriot Luka Modric in style.

French full-back Anthony Reveillere, 34, is to train with Sunderland ahead of a proposed deal. Reveillere, formerly at Napoli is a free agent.
