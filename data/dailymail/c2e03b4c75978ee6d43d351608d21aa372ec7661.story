Australian Cameron Meyer claimed a sprint finish to win the second stage of the Tour de Suisse on Sunday.

German Tony Martin retained the overall leader's yellow jersey, while Sir Bradley Wiggins is in 13th place, some 32 seconds behind.

Orica-GreenEdge racer Meyer beat Team Sky's Philip Deignan and Lawrence Warbasse of BMC Racing at the end of the 182km ride from Bellinzona to Sarnen.

Meyer had battled to catch the breakaway of Reto Hollenstein and Bjorn Thurau before making his move, while Martin's work at the head of the peloton was enough to keep his advantage.

World champion Martin, who had claimed the opening stage time trial, is six seconds ahead of Dutchman Tom Dumoulin, of Giant-Shimano, with Australian Rohan Dennis third at 13 seconds.
