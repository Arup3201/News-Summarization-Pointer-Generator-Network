Newly released interviews by witnesses from the Steubenville rape case reveal shocking admissions by those who say they saw the 16-year-old girl getting dangerously drunk and abused but did nothing to help.

'I could tell that she was gradually getting more drunk and worse throughout the night,' Farrah Marcino, a fellow 16-year-old and witness to the horrific scene is heard telling detectives in newly released video to ABC.

'Just like, that she couldn't, like, she didn't walk,' she said.

Witnesses: Newly released police interviews by teens, Farrah Marcino pictured, who saw a 16-year-old girl getting blackout drunk reveal how they saw her in trouble but did nothing to help

Morning after: This 16-year-old boy recounts to detectives of coming downstairs the morning after the house party and finding the girl naked on the couch

'She was a mess … she wasn’t responding,' 18-year-old Anthony Craig also told detectives.

Another teen told detectives that he overheard someone offer $3 to anyone who would pee on her while she was lying in a street after vomiting on herself. He said that fortunately no one did.

Craig told police he ended up taking two pictures of the girl himself during that night last August before deleting them from his phone. Authorities were later unable to recover them.

But other photos and videos capturing the heinous crime weren't deleted.

Instead they were posted to YouTube, Twitter and Instagram, showing the young teenaged girl being carried around before spectators at the party while appearing to be unconscious.

'She looks dead lmao,' one teen texted to seeing the photo of her carried around.

'You should've moved her around and got a better angle,' another wrote.

Abused: One teen seen here tells detectives that he heard someone offer $3 to anyone who would pee on the girl as she at one point lay in the street after throwing up

Silence: In the end none of the witnesses at the party or teens alleged to be involved in the case, Michael Nodianos seen right, called police over the treatment of the girl though many used their cell phones to take pictures and record video

Evan Westlake, who testified at the trial while under immunity, admitted to filming and posting a
12-minute video to YouTube showing the incident. Another student, 
Michael Nodianos, cruelly joked about the attack himself online.

Women's rights groups demanded that Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine 
charge Nodianos with failure to report a crime despite the student defending himself as having not been there.

'She was passed out,' Craig told detectives. 'That’s when they picked her up, and they carried her out of the house.'

Nude photos taken of her were later found on 17-year-old Trent Mays' cell phone.

He and 16-year-old Ma'lik Richmond, both
former football players at their high school, were the two filmed 
carrying the girl away. They later were found guilty of raping her 
through digital penetration.

'She wanted to go with Trent. Like, we just kept trying to tell her, "You don’t want to do this. You don’t want to go with them,”' Marcino said.

'I just let her do what she want[ed], which I understand was wrong,' she told detectives.

Both Marcino and Craig testified in the rape trial.

In a later interview with ABC Richmond described the photo showing the teen being carried by her hands and feet as consensual.

He explained that the girl 'was willing to get into the picture that way.'

'We asked her and that's when she said yeah that's fine,' he said.

But asked why that photo was taken, he said: 'Her ex-boyfriend said that he wanted to get a picture of this drunk B.'

The victim described herself waking up the next morning naked and too drunk to remember what happened the night before.

Angry: When the victim woke up the next day to find photos and video of her online she texted Mays outraged, asking him what had happened and why she was missing her clothes as seen here

Guilty: Ma'Lik Richmond, 16,  left, and Trent Mays, 17,  right were 
found guilty of rape and other charges in Steubenville, Ohio on Sunday 
after the incident last August

Sentenced: Ma'Lik Richmond burst into tears following the trial's verdict that sentenced him and Mays, seen in yellow, to a minimum of one year in a juvenile institution

When
she discovered the slew of photos online the next day, she texted Mays 
outraged, asking him what had happened and why her clothes were off.

'You should of protected me. Anyone with a heart would have tried to stop that,' she wrote him according to ABC.

Mays tells her he is 'truly sorry,' 
according to the text message exchange. He adds: 'Like I'm about to get 
kicked off my football team.'

Video and photos taken of the event are what brought the rape case to light.

In all 13 cell phones were analyzed for evidence, along with 308,586 photos, 940 videos, 96,270 text messages and 3,188 phone calls.

Richmond and Mays were both convicted of rape on Sunday and sentenced to at least one year in a juvenile detention institution with the maximum stay of until they are 21.

Mays faced an additional charge of the use and dissemination of nude images of a minor. He received the same sentence for that to run consecutively.

Both pleaded not guilty to their crimes.

'Nothing happened that evening that is non-consensual. There is no evidence to suggest that she was unconscious while lying there naked on that basement floor,' Richmond's attorney told ABC News before their verdict.

To questions of the girl's impairment he added: 'No witness ever used the word impaired. Substantial impaired where you can't consent is the issue.'

'I realize that I did, I was doing wrong by drinking and partying, you know, after dark,' Richmond told ABC just before he was found guilty. 'But I really did not, I didn’t rape anybody. I didn’t witness a rape going on. And if I would have thought that somebody was being raped or anything like that, I would have stopped it.'
