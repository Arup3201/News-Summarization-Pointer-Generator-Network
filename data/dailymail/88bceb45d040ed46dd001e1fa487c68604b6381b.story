A 76-year-old Wisconsin woman accused of killing her infant daughter more than a half-century ago will serve 45 days in jail and 10 years' probation, under a plea agreement approved Monday.

Ruby Klokow was charged with second-degree murder in the 1957 death of her 6-month-old daughter, Jeaneen, only after her son, James Klokow Jr., came forward in 2008 with horrific stories of childhood abuse.

District Attorney Joe De Cecco cited Klokow's advanced age and health as factors in the agreement approved by Sheboygan County District Judge Angela Sutkiewicz.

De Cecco said if Klokow had been tried, she might have been acquitted altogether and walked free.

A jury could no longer have convicted her of a lesser charge, such as manslaughter, because of the statute of limitations.

Bargain: Ruby Klokow, left, leaves court with attorney Kirk Obear on Monday following a hearing in which she pleaded no contest to second-degree murder as part of a plea deal reached with prosecutors

Plea: Klokow's attorney, Kirk Obear, said he thought the case against  was unfair. 'There were witnesses that could have been interviewed that have long since died,' he said

No charges were filed after Jeaneen's
death in 1957. Ruby Klokow told the police that the baby had fallen off
a sofa while she was tending to a crying James.

An autopsy found that Jeaneen had suffered two brain hemorrhages, a partially collapsed lung and three scalp bruises.

At a preliminary hearing five decades
later, a forensic pathologist who reviewed documents in the case 
testified that the severity of the injuries didn't match Klokow's 
explanation.

According to a criminal complaint, Klokow admitted causing her daughter's death.

Klokow had been free pending trial and 
will remain free until formal sentencing April 15. After the plea 
hearing, she told reporters, 'It's not over until it's over.'

Agreement: Ruby Klokow, 76, was charged with second-degree murder in her baby's death in 1957. But she will serve less than seven weeks in jail

Her attorney, Kirk Obear, said he 
thought the case against Klokow was unfair. 'There were witnesses that 
could have been interviewed that have long since died,' he said.

Scott
Klokow, another of Ruby Klokow's children, was found dead in his crib 
seven years after Jeaneen died. No charges have been filed in his death.

Obear
noted that Jeaneen and Scott were exhumed but that nothing was 
discovered at odds with the initial accidental death rulings.

DeCecco's
announcement last week of a plea agreement came as a relief to James 
Klokow, now 57. He said he had feared his mother 'turning and 
questioning (him) on the stand.'

In an interview with The Associated Press, he said his mother had regularly beaten and choked him.

The
case was delayed several times after Klokow was charged in 2011, 
including for mental tests to see if she was competent to stand trial.

Klokow
was arrested at her home in February 2011 following a two-year 
investigation that uncovered a catalog of abuse suffered by her other 
children.

In 2009, Klokow's son James went to 
police with his long-held suspicion that his mother had killed Jeaneen 
at their home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

He
said the family had suffered years of abuse when their mother had been 
drinking and believed his sister's death wasn't accidental.

Police reviewed their decades-old reports and searched for hospital and social service records as part of their investigation.

Infant grave: Klokow told detectives she grabbed the 6-month-old child and threw her toward the couch. The baby, she said, let out a 'different kind of cry' and her eyes looked strange, according to a criminal complaint

The
body of the newborn was also exhumed and a new examination ordered. 
Another of her children, Scott, who died in 1964, was also exhumed and 
examined for abuse.

Two 
pathologists who reviewed the autopsy results agreed that Klokow's claim
of a 16-inch fall from a sofa could hardly have caused the girl's 
injuries.

After Klokow was interviewed by detectives she admitted she had been 'mean' to her daughter and her son Scott.

According to a criminal complaint Klokow admitted she was frustrated that both Jeaneen and James  were crying at the same time.

She told detectives she grabbed 
Jeaneen from her stroller and threw her toward the couch. The baby, she 
said, let out a 'different kind of cry' and her eyes looked strange, 
according to the complaint. 

Klokow told police she was struggling to cope with four young children.

She told detectives she wished she had never had children and acknowledged being abusive towards them.

The
criminal complaint detailed a long list of other abuse against the 
children, including allegations that she broke James's arm and nose in 
separate incidents, and injured his knees by kicking him with steel-toed
boots on multiple occasions.

District Attorney Joe De Cecco cited Klokow's advanced age and health as factors in the agreement reached at Sheboygan County Circuit Court (pictured)

The complaint also says she made her
son Bruce stand in a corner with a paper bag on his head at the age of five
or six while she hit each of his toes with a hammer.

Prosecutor Joe DeCecco said in 2011: 'We have to recognise it was something that happened in 1957 and it wasn't intentional, although it was reckless.

'She had a lot of kids at a relatively young age, she wasn't happy in her marriage, there was a lot of drinking going on there and she had a temper.'
