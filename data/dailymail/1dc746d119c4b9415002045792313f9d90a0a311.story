Pauline Butler, from Rawdon, West Yorkshire, who was found stabbed to death. Her husband John is now in custody accused of murder

A furniture salesman who starred in the BBC show The Fixer has been charged with the murder of his wife.

John Butler, 62, was arrested after police discovered wife Pauline's body at a retirement complex in the Rawdon area of Leeds, West Yorkshire.

The 61-year-old was found on Monday morning with knife wounds to her neck, chest and back.

A post mortem examination found she died of blood loss having sustained a number of stab wounds.

The
 couple's family-run furniture business, Kettley's Furniture, appeared 
in the first series of The Fixer, presented by business guru Alex 
Polizzi.

It is aimed at 
helping struggling firms turn their fortunes around. Kettley's had been 
hit by falling profits and was in desperate need of help, The Sun reported.

The
 show aired in February 2012 and last year returned to see if the 
changed Polizzi suggested had worked. Sales had soared and the 
33-year-old business had returned to profit.

Butler appeared at Leeds Magistrates' Court yesterday morning charged with her murder.

He spoke only to confirm his name and that he understood the charge laid against him.

District Judge Roy Anderson adjourned the hearing and Butler was remanded in custody to reappear at Leeds Crown Court today.

Yesterday, shutters remained down on the couple's store, with a sign telling customers: Closed until Tues April 22 due to family bereavement.'

DCI Steve Snow from West Yorkshire Police, said on Monday: 'Following a call from the Ambulance Service at around 11.30am, officers attended the property and found the body of deceased woman.

'It would appear at this time to be a domestic related incident, however; we are currently working to establish the full circumstances of this incident.'
