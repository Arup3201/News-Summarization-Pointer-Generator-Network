Manchester United's young guns are threatening to replicate the club's famous Class of '92 once again after beginning the Milk Cup with consecutive wins - including an 11-0 thrashing of Australian side Gold Coast Academy.

The Red Devils Under 16s, who are competing in the tournament's Premier section against sides from all over the world, won the title last year and the current crop are well on their way to retaining the prestigious trophy following an unbeaten start in Northern Ireland.

If successful, the Old Trafford youngsters would follow in the footsteps of David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville and Co, who got their hands on the same silverware back in 1991.

Talent: United's under-16 side, pictured here at the opening parade, have begun the Milk Cup with two wins

United need just a point to qualify for the Milk Cup semi-finals, leaving them just two games away from retaining their title.

The 20 teams who finish outside of the top four positions after their opening three games will then be split into five sections - Globe, Vase, Bowl, Salver and Shield.

They then face off in a series of semi-finals and finals to determine who wins each section.

The other sides taking part are: Benfica, Newcastle, CSKA Moscow, Espanyol, Brentford, Cherry Orchard, Vendee, Partick Thistle, Ichifuna FC, Lusaka Academy, County Armagh, County Antrim, Club America, Chertanovo Academy, County Londonderry, County Down, County Tyrone, Otago, County Fermanagh, Goald Coast Academy, Craig Bellamy Foundation, OC Blues and Bohemians.

The competition was established back in 1983, when eight sides from Ulster took part along with teams including Algeria, Motherwell and a side from La Roche-sur-Yon in France.

The tournament grew quickly and was soon attracting professional teams from all over the world, with many keen to test their most talented youth players against those from other countries.

It is now made up of four sections - Elite, Premier, Junior and Minor - which represent age groups from Under 19 to Under 13.

Paul McGuinness' side began the defence of their crown with a comprehensive win against the Aussies, with Demetri Mitchell grabbing four goals in an attacking display which wouldn't have looked out of place had Fergie's fledglings managed it 23 years ago.

That team, which also included Nicky Butt, Keith Gillespie and Robbie Savage, demolished rivals Liverpool 4-1 on their way to a 2-0 win against Scottish side Hearts in the final.

United's current side, which includes highly-rated triallist Oscar Borg of West Ham, ran riot in their opening game and then followed it up with a comfortable 3-0 triumph over local side County Armagh.

The 
reigning champions now face a tricky tie against Russian side CSKA 
Moscow, who have also begun with successive victories against Otago 
Academy and Bohemian FC.

The knockout phase awaits McGuinness' youngsters in the upcoming days, but the biggest test of their careers is still to come.

Can
 any of them take the next step and graduate from the youth ranks to 
United's first team, just as Beckham and Co managed to do so 
successfully in the mid-nineties? Win another trophy in Coleraine and 
talk of the class of '14 may be spoken a little louder.

Axel Tuanzebe Â 

Age: 16

Position: Centre-back

United youth coaches believe that Tuanzebe, who has captained United at the Milk Cup, will emerge as the leader of the heart of the defence in the Under 18 team. Born in the Democratic Republic of Congo and brought up in Rochdale, he was part of the Milk Cup winning side last year. Academy advisor and United's former chief scout Les Kershaw says: 'He's a very, very good player and is one of them that I like because he has a strong personality.'

Marcus Rashford

Age: 16

Position: Forward

A local boy, Rashford has been closely monitored by Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal but he is a United fan and the club consider him to be one of the most exciting talents at the club. Rashford scored twice in the 11-0 win against Gold Coast Academy and also scored in the 3-0 victory over Co Armagh on Tuesday

Demetri Mitchell

Age: 17

Position: Winger

A wide-man blessed with pace and trickery, Mitchell has represented England at Under 16 and was part of the Under 17 squad that won the European Championship earlier this year. He has scored five goals in two games at Milk Cup already.
