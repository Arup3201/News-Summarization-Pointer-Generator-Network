Prince Michael of Kent still carries out a busy schedule of engagements at the age of 72, but the Queen’s beloved cousin has been fighting a secret health battle.

The grandson of George V underwent surgery for prostate cancer and has been successfully receiving treatment.

Members of the Royal Family are usually reluctant to discuss their health issues, but the Prince has bravely decided to confirm details, in support of the thousands of other sufferers of the disease.

‘Prince Michael regards all medical issues as personal and private,’ his spokesman, Simon Astaire, tells me.

‘However, he has authorised me to tell you that this particular problem was, happily, diagnosed very early and treated successfully last year by a surgical team who have his admiration and gratitude. There will be no further comment.’

A neighbour of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace, the Prince is one of the 40,000 men in Britain each year who are affected by prostate cancer, which is the most common form of the disease in males. One in eight will develop the illness, with most cases occurring after the age of 65.

The Queen's cousin: Prince Michael of Kent

Born July 4, 1942, Prince Michael of Kent is is a grandson of King George V and Queen Mary, and a cousin of the Queen. 

At the time of his birth Prince Michael was seventh in the line of succession to his uncle, King George VI.

He is also the first cousin once removed of the Duke of Edinburgh, and a great-great grandson of Tsar Alexander II of Russia.

The Prince speaks Russian fluently and has a strong interest in the country. When the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II and some of his family were discovered in 1979, the remains were identified by DNA, with the Prince's blood sample used, among others, for recognition.

After attending Eton College, the Prince went to the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst in 1961, and commissioned into the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert's Own), beginning a 20 year career in the Armed Forces in which he served in Germany, Hong Kong, and Cyprus.

The Prince, who manages his own consultancy business, occasionally represents the Queen in carrying out royal duties abroad and has also presented television documentaries on European royal families.

He has never received a parliamentary annuity or an allowance from the British Privy Purse, unlike both his elder brother, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, and his sister, Princess Alexandra, who carry out official royal duties in the United Kingdom. However, he was given a grace and favour apartment at Kensington Palace upon his marriage to Marie-Christine von Reibnitz  in 1978.

Under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701, Prince
 Michael forfeited his place in the succession through marriage to Marie-Christine, who is known as Princess Michael of Kent, as she was a 
Roman Catholic.

The couple have two children, Lord Frederick Windsor and Lady 
Gabriella Windsor, and a granddaughter, Frederick's daughter Maud, who turns one next month.

The majority are ‘slow growing’ and medical guidance often advises keeping it under surveillance. Many men with the cancer will suffer no harm from it, while treatment options, including surgery and radiotherapy, can have serious side effects.

At the time of his birth, the Prince was seventh in the line of succession. His 78-year-old brother, the Duke of Kent, who carries out engagements on behalf of the Queen, spent a week in hospital last year after suffering what was described as a ‘mild’ stroke.

Prince Michael’s 69-year-old wife, Marie-Christine, was treated for skin cancer in 1999. The Bohemia-born Princess Michael, who had a tumour removed from her foot by laser surgery, said she felt ‘rather put out’ instead of frightened when the disease was first diagnosed.

‘People tend to panic at the mention of the word cancer, but I wasn’t upset or frightened when the doctor told me,’ said the Princess, who previously had successful surgery on her face, leg and arm.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men in the UK, although the numbers of those with the disease is on the rise.

Every year in the UK more than 40,000 men are struck with prostate cancer, around one in eight

Around 250,000 are currently living with the disease, with symptoms including frequent trips to the toilet, pain during sex and reduced flow of urine.

Prostate cancer does not normally cause symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the urethra, and not all men diagnosed with prostate cancer have symptoms, meaning it is important to speak regularly with doctors.

The chances of developing prostate cancer increase as people get older, with the majority of cases developing in men aged 50 or older.

Some cases of prostate cancer can be cured if treated in the early stages, with treatments including surgically removing the prostate, radiotherapy and hormone therapy.

Other cases are only diagnosed at a later stage when the cancer has spread. If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, typically the bones, it cannot be cured and treatment is focused on prolonging life and relieving symptoms.

As prostate cancer usually progresses very slowly, those with the disease can live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment.
