Caroline Burton, 39, has been named midwife of the year after comforting a mother through a stillbirth - then changing her shift to make sure she was on hand to help with the same woman's second birth 11 months later.

Ms Burton, from Lancing in Sussex, changed shifts to make sure she was on duty at Princess Royal Hospital, Haywards Heath, West Sussex, when Louise Whitmore gave birth to her baby boy.

As a result, the dedicated professional has been named Johnson's Baby Mums' Midwife of the Year Award 2014, for the extraordinary care and support she gave to Mrs Whitmore.

11 months earlier, Ms Burton had stayed beyond her shift to comfort Louise, 43, and her husband Marc, during the birth of their stillborn daughter.

Ms Burton then volunteered to be with the Whitmore family for the birth of Zachary - despite not being on shift and having to arrange extra childcare for her own son.

Mrs Whitmore said: 'For my son's birth, Caroline volunteered to be with us from the beginning of my induction despite not being on shift.

'She dealt with practical issues which caused me great anxiety and cared for my husband too and really took time to understand me and my family.

Although Caroline Burton took the overall title, five regional winners were also announced.

Here is the list in full:

Caroline Burton - London and South East, and Midwife of the Year

Eileen McConville - Northern Ireland

Laura Main - Scotland

Joan Ellard - North England

Elspeth Lancaster - Wales

Vivienne Cutler - South & Midlands

'Caroline helped us rejoice in our son while remembering our daughter and for that I am forever grateful.'

Ms Burton added: 'I still can't quite believe it, it was such a shock when I found out I had won. It is a wonderful surprise.

'The Whitmore family are very special to me; I am proud to have been their midwife for both of their children. I feel extremely honoured that Louise nominated me.'

The award, which is part of The RCM Annual Midwifery Awards, recognises the incredible work done by outstanding midwives across the country.

It is the only award which allows mothers to nominate midwives who they feel provided exceptional support before, during and after the birth of their child. 

During 2013, nominations were sent to the judging panel by parents from across the country, who felt their midwives deserved that extra bit of recognition.

The entries were thenput through a rigorous judging process by the panel of senior RCM midwives and representatives from Johnson & Johnson Limited.

The panel looked at the extent to which the midwife demonstrated best clinical practice, their emotional support for the mother and the help they provided in strengthening the bond between the parents and the baby. 

Louise Silverton, Director for Midwifery at the RCM said: 'We are thrilled to announce that Caroline Burton has won the award.

'These awards not only allow mothers to thank their midwives for their exceptional work, but pay tribute to the fantastic job they do every day.

'It's clear that midwives do everything they can to help make the experience of having a baby a memorable one.'

The six regional winners were also given their trophies at the RCM 12th Annual Awards ceremony which was held in London.

Winners were invited onto the stage to collect their trophies from Professor Cathy Warwick CBE, Chief Executive of the RCM.
