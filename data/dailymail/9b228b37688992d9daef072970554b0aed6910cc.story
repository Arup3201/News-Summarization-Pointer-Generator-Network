The album, called Beautiful Life, includes Ana singing hymn Come Thou Almighty King while her brother plays the piano

After Ana's death, her father found a homemade book on her desk titled 'Ana's flower book for Dad'.

The booked was filled with pages of flowers drawn in different colors and shapes and inspired Mr Greene to put the record together.

The album, called Beautiful Life, features ballads, hymns and three songs Mr Greene composed himself to honour Ana.

The new record will include Ana singing the hymn Come Thou Almighty King with her brother playing on the piano. Greene sings about his hope to one day join her in Heaven.

Mr Greene told NPR: 'I want the music to reflect the way that Ana lived.

'My daughter, who always loved to be around my son when he was practicing, she would be around the piano and she sung the lyrics to Come Thou Almighty King while he was playing.'

Mr Greene wants the album to paint a picture of how his daughter lived, 'lovingly, faithfully and joyfully'

Victims: Lanza killed 27 people, most pictured above, including Ana (top left) at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Connecticut

Mr Greene, who is also assistant professor of music and assistant coordinator of jazz studies at Western Connecticut State University, added: 'Sitting in my basement where I have my work area by myself, and writing the songs and writing the lyrics, there was a lot of tears. There was a lot of anguish.

'Much attention has been paid to the way in which my precious Ana died but this album attempts to paint the picture of how she lived – lovingly, faithfully and joyfully.'

A children's choir on the record is made up of friends of Ana and her brother from their old home in Canada as well as classmates from Newtown.

Many of them were too emotional to sing during the recording sessions, Mr Greene said.

The Sandy Hook massacre saw 20 pupils aged six and seven, as well as six teaching staff, killed by Adam Lanza.

Lanza murdered his mother before heading to the Newtown school and indiscriminately shooting children. 

Less than five minutes after entering the school, Lanza turned the gun on himself.
