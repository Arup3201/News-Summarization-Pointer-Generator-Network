Freed: Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny embraces his wife Yulia at court in Kirov as he is released less than 24 hours after being jailed for five years for embezzlement

A lawyer who unmasked corruption among leaders of his United Russia party has been freed from jail - less than 24 hours after he was sentenced to five years for embezzlement.

Alexei Navalny, 37, was released following a surprise request from prosecution lawyers who argued to free him because he is a candidate in the Moscow mayoral election later this year.

They said that keeping him behind bars would deny him his right to seek election.

Following a hearing that lasted less than an hour, a smiling Mr Navalny hugged his wife Yulia and thanked those supporters who protested against his imprisonment yesterday.

The charismatic anti-corruption blogger was found guilty of heading a group that embezzled 16 million rubles (£330,000) of timber from state-owned company Kirovles in 2009 while he worked as an unpaid adviser to the provincial governor in Kirov, about 470 miles east of Moscow.

His release, the conditions of which say he cannot leave Moscow, will extend until he has appealed his conviction.

Mr Navalny, a popular blogger and corruption-fighting lawyer, rose to prominence among the opposition during a series of massive protests in Moscow against President Vladimir Putin's re-election to a third presidential term in March last year.

His conviction prompted criticism from the United States and the European Union.

The trial had been denounced by his supporters as a show trial ‘redolent of the Stalin era’.

Prosecutors had asked for a six year sentence for the embezzlement which allegedly took place in the same year that Navalny started an anti-corruption blog against Putin.

His jailing was widely seen as a tactic 
to prevent him running for Moscow mayor this year and challenging Mr 
Putin for the Kremlin in 2018.

Support: As well as greeting his wife, Navalny also thanked those supporters who had protested against his jailing yesterday

Foreign Secretary William Hague blasted ‘the selective application of the rule of law in Russia’.

Former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Michael McFaul, US Ambassador to Russia, also condemned the political use of courts.

Navalny made his name by blogging about his investigations into corruption at state-owned companies where he owned shares, reaching hundreds of thousands of people.

He and his team of lawyers and activists have plumbed property registers abroad to identify top officials and lawmakers who own undeclared foreign assets and hold foreign citizenship.

Navalny's blog quickly became an Internet sensation not only because of his exposures but because of its engaging illustrations, funny images and witty catchphrases.

It was Navalny who first called the dominant United Russia party 'the party of crooks and thieves', a phrase that still dogs Kremlin loyalists.

The opposition leader's investigations targeted a wide circle of Putin loyalists - from members of Parliament to state bankers - threatening to discredit the system of governance he has built.

He was a leader of the wave of massive protest rallies that broke out in late 2011 after a national parliamentary election scarred by allegations of widespread fraud.

Yesterday: A post on Navalny's Twitter account during the long verdict reading noted the thick packet of papers the judge was reading and said: 'We're going crazy while we listen'

More recently, he pushed his ambitions by declaring himself a candidate for the capital's mayoral election.

While
waiting for the sentence yesterday for him and co-defendant Pyotr 
Ofitserov - who was also found guilty of embezzlement - Navalny played 
with his smartphone and occasionally smiled sardonically.

A
post on his Twitter account during the long verdict reading noted the 
thick packet of papers the judge was reading and said: 'We're going 
crazy while we listen.'

Ofitserov ran a timber trading company in Kirov during Navalny's time in the region.

The judge said he found the testimony of key prosecution witness Vyacheslav Opalev to be 'trustworthy and consistent.'

Opalev,
who was the timber company's general director, got a suspended sentence
in an expedited trial in December after pleading guilty to conspiring 
with Navalny.

Navalny insists Opalev framed him out
of revenge. Navalny had recommended that Opalev be fired and that 
officials investigate potential corruption in his company, which had 
incurred 200 million rubles (£4million) in losses by the time Navalny 
arrived in the region. 

Throughout
the trial, testimony of prosecution witnesses clashed with the core 
arguments of the indictment that claimed Navalny's work in Kirov led to 
the embezzlement.

None of 
the managers at Kirovles who appeared in court, except for Opalev, were 
able to confirm that Navalny defrauded the company. 

Navalny
had long said he expected to be convicted, and in a final blog post 
before leaving Moscow for Kirov, he downplayed his personal importance 
to the wider opposition. 

'The
most important thing is to muster up the strength, shake off laziness 
and do something. This doesn't require any leadership as such,' he 
wrote.
