For most people, Martin Scorsese’s latest offering, The Wolf of Wall Street, is nothing more than an entertaining film about glamorous and despicable con men - but for Christina McDowell it is a slice of her past that continues to haunt her. 

McDowell is the daughter of Tom Prousalis, a former business associate of Jordan Belfort, the self-described Wolf of Wall Street who is played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the new film currently out in theaters.

In an open letter published in LA Weekly Thursday, McDowell condemned the makers of the film and its star, Mr DiCaprio, accusing them of glorifying fraud and celebrating greed with little regard for the consequences of the swindlers' actions.

Under fire: Director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, pictured earlier this month at a screening of The Wolf of Wall Street, have been criticized in an open letter written by the daughter of a con man

Wrong message: Christina McDowell accused the makers of the film, which follows the rise and fall of penny stock swindler Jordan Belfort as played by Mr DiCaprio, of celebrating greed and crime

McDowell, who explained in the letter that she was forced to change her name after her father had stolen her identity, said that she was 18 years old in 2004 when Prousalis, then 55, went on trial for penny stock fraud.

At the time, The Washington Post described the case as a postscript to the 'pump-and-dump' scandals of the previous decade related to several shell companies that cost unsuspecting investors millions of dollars in losses.

Prousalis was the securities attorney for the bogus businesses, which were taken public by Stratton Oakmant, Inc owned by Belfort in order to defraud investors to the tune of some $200million.

McDowell recounted that when her father first went into business with Belfort and his ilk, she and her family were living a charmed life.

'I drove a white Range Rover in high school, snorted half of Colombia, and got any guy I ever wanted because my father would take them flying in his King Air,' she said of the heady 90s.

But for McDowell, her mother and two sisters it all came crashing down when the truth behind Belfort's scheme began unraveling.

Stinging rebuke: McDowell wrote that Scorsese's film glorifies the same bad behavior that nearly brought American economy to its knees a few years ago

Landed on his feet: Real-life Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort, pictured right with his wife, served 22 months in prison and was ordered to pay $110.4million, but reinvented himself ans an author and motivational speaker 

When her father surrendered to prison in the fall of 2004 after pleading guilty to securities fraud charges, his 18-year-old daughter drove him. 

When Christine returned home that day, she was inundated with phone calls from her father’s creditors and attorneys representing swindled investors threatening to sue the 18-year-old girl.

'He'd left me in nearly $100,000 worth of debt,' she wrote of her jailed father. 'He left and never told me.'

Once all of Prousalis’ money was gone, much of it used to repay the investors, the family fell on hard times.

McDowell’s 17-year-old sister ran away from home, while her older sibling struggled to finish school. Christine McDowell described it as a confusing experience, going from her father's private jet to waiting table for meager tips.

'I couch surfed for two years, 
sometimes dressing out of my car and stealing pieces of salami out of my
 boyfriends' refrigerators in the middle of the night, ‘ she wrote, 
‘because I was so hungry and so ashamed that I couldn't feed myself.'

McDowell,
 now in her late 20s, concluded her letter with a lengthy rant against 
Scorsese and DiCaprio - 'Marty and Leo’ - calling them 'dangerous' and 
rebuking them for making a film that turns financial schemes rooted in 
greed into entrainment.

Punishment: McDowell's father, a securities lawyer not portrayed in the movie, went to prison in 2004 for securities fraud in connection to Belfort's scam

Sexist: McDowell also railed again what she called blatant misogyny on display in the film

‘We want to get lost in what? These phony financiers' fun sexcapades and coke binges? Come on, we know the truth,’ she said. ‘This kind of behavior brought America to its knees.’

She also accused the filmmakers of aligning themselves with Belfort  - in her words an accomplished criminal – who has yet to make full restitution to his victims.

Belfort was indicted in 1998 for securities fraud and money laundering. After cooperating with the FBI, he served 22 months in prison and was ordered to pay back $110.4million – about half of the total losses incurred by his investors.

Since his release from prison, Belfort penned two memoirs, including The Wolf of Wall Street which served as the basis for Scorsese’s movie, and has been touring the world as a motivational speaker.

In her ire-filled letter addressed to the creators of the film and Belfort himself, McDowell drove the point home, saying that a man like Belfort does not deserve to be a protagonist in a movie.

As a parting salvo, Prousalis’s daughter concluded her letter by urging 'every human in America' not to support Scorsese's film.

‘Because if you do, you're simply continuing to feed the Wolves of Wall Street,' she wrote.

In a postscript, McDowell added that her father is now doing business with the Albanian government and is married to a 30-year-old translator.
