The deceased Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his wife Katherine relied on food stamps and public assistance from 2011 to 2012, soon after they became parents.

New details have emerged about taxpayer money that was shelled out to the family of the bombing suspects, after the Mass. Gov. previously refused to divulge information on their welfare benefits.

A state lawmaker was able to obtain data about government assistance the Tsarnaevs received and that information was passed on to the media.

In need: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, left on April 20 in Cambridge, and her husband, right in 2009, began receiving welfare shortly after the birth of their daughter

Example: The suspects' parents Zubeidat, left, and Anzor, right both at a news conference on Thursday in Dagestan, Russia, also received federal and state welfare benefits when they lived in the U.S.

On Friday, the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance detailed how the couple received food stamps from September 2011 to November 2012.

The couple, who married in June 2010, are believed to have become parents to their daughter, Zahara, in 2011, in the months before they began receiving the aid.

In addition to food stamps, the young family also benefited from TAFDC (Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children), a program for low income parents with dependent children.

TAFDC is paid out twice a month and can be directly deposited into a recipient's bank account.

The assistance was paid to Katherine, since a person must be a U.S. citizen, or eligible non-citizen, to receive the aid.

While the couple took the government aid, the 24-year-old Rhode Island native would sometimes clock as many as 80 hours a week while 
her unemployed husband stayed at home.

Ultimately his wife's income made the couple ineligible for welfare and they stopped receiving state money in November 2012.

Welfare officials were forced to divulge details of the aid that was paid out to the family of the bombing suspects, a turn around from their previous strategy of stonewalling.

Mass. Gov. Patrick Deval 
signaled to state agencies this week that they should not discuss the details of what 
government assistance Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had received, citing privacy concerns.

Food Stamps:

Oct. 2002 to Nov. 2004: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) received food stamps

Aug. 2009 to Dec. 2011: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) received food stamps

Sep. 2011 to Nov. 2012: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev received food stamps

Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (TAFDC):

Jan. 2003 to March 2003: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) collected TAFDC money

Aug. 2009 to June 2010: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) collected TAFDC money

Sept. 2011 to Nov. 2012: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev collected TAFDC money

Though the welfare information is not
 available for release unless the person in question provides their 
consent - it is available to lawmakers.

Thus, Mass. State 
Representative David Linsky called on the Massachusetts
 Department of Transitional Assistance to provide him with the information.

Linksy issued an ultimatum on Thursday to welfare officials, 
giving them 24 hours to provide the information.

The letter from Rep. Linsky was provided to the Boston Herald.

'My office is working to fully comply with your request,'  DTA interim commissioner Stacey Monahan wrote in his report to Rep. Linsky, saying they were only providing a summary 'given the great interest in this matter.'

In addition to the aid paid out to Tamerlan and his wife, both alleged bombers had benefited from welfare since their parents Anzor and Zubeidat Tsarnaev collected foodstamps and TAFDC - from 2002 to 2004 and again in 2009 to 2011.

Since the Tsarnaevs are Chechen immigrants, some wondered why they received aid but the state agency explained that they were considered eligible for the public assistance. 

'The Tsarnaev parents were eligible to 
receive benefits as legal, non-citizen residents who were granted asylum
 status and met the basic eligibility criteria for DTA, including 
household income levels, presence of dependent children and other 
factors,' the DTA interim commissioner Stacey Monahan said in a letter 
addressed to David Linsky, Chairman of the House Post Audit and 
Oversight Committee.

The governor of Massachusetts tried to stop state agencies from releasing welfare information this week.

Gov.
 Deval Patrick's administration on Thursday flatly refused to answer any
 media inquiries about taxpayers money that funded the suspected 
bombers, citing the Tsarnaevs right to privacy.

On Wednesday, state officials had confirmed that the deceased suspect, 26-year-old
 Tamerlan, received welfare benefits. They also said the brothers' 
family had relied on state benefits when they were children.

News that one of the alleged 
terrorist had received state money sparked outrage in the community, 
recovering after the blasts on April 15 that left 3 dead and more than 
260 injured.

On Thursday, multiple state agencies, seemingly at the prompting of the Patrick administration, refused to comment further on benefits received by the brothers.

When asked if Tamerlan had received unemployment benefits, Labor
 department spokesman Kevin Franck refused to comment, saying the matter
 was 'confidential and not a matter of public record,' The Herald 
reported.

University 
of Massachusetts Dartmouth spokesman Robert Connolly also refused to 
comment on the financial aid application of 19-year-old sophomore Dzhokhar.

'It
 is our position - and I believe the accepted position in higher 
education - that student records including academic records and 
financial records (including financial aid) cannot under federal law be 
released without a student’s consent.'

The Federal Communications Commission would not discuss whether the suspected bombers had a government-paid cellphone.

Housing
 officials in Cambridge also would not comment on if the brothers ever 
had Section 8 assistance, a rental subsidy offered by the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development to low income households.

Wife: Katherine Tsarnaeva, pictured leaving her lawyer's office in Providence, R.I. on Tuesday, met Tamerlan in 2009 at a nightclub. They married in June 2010, when she was 21-years-old

The Herald had reported that sources who knew Tamerlan said that though he sported a flashy appearance, he failed to earn very
 much money for his family and was essentially a stay-at-home dad.

His younger brother, on the other hand, has been described as more entrepreneurial.

Dzhokhar, who was a sophomore at 
University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, attended the school on a 
scholarship and earned petty cash selling marijuana, sources told the 
Boston Globe.

Investigators are scrutinizing the 
brothers' source of income, as they probe whether the pair received 
outside assistance for their attack, either from a radical group or 
foreign government.

Security experts have noted though 
that the modus operandi was relatively cheap, estimating that the 
materials for each of the pressure cooker bombs used at the Boston 
Marathon attack could have cost a total of $100 each.

Tamerlan, 26,
 died early on 
April 19 after a shoot-out with police in Watertown, Mass. His 
19-year-old brother was captured late on April 19 after an extensive 
manhunt.

Marriage: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in 2009 at Boston's Wai Kru Mixed Martial Arts center, was unemployed. Friends say he and his wife had a tempestuous relationship and said he would call Katherine a 'slut' and 'prostitute'

Officials believe that Tamerlan became heavily influenced by radical Muslim ideology sometime between 2008 and 2009 before he met his future wife.

A lawyer for the 24-year-old said she
 was a student at Suffolk University in Boston when she was introduced to Tamerlan at a nightclub, believed to be sometime during 2009.

Katherine Russell Tsarnaev converted to Islam to marry the terrorist suspect in June 2010, when she was 21-years-old

Around the same time, Russell became pregnant with Tamerlan's baby. She dropped out of school in her senior year and reportedly began pulling away from her friends and family.

After their marriage, she lived with Tamerlan, 'raising her child and working long hours, caring for people in their homes who are unable to care for themselves,' her lawyers said in a statement.

Her husband reportedly looked after their young child, Zahara.

Friends have told the media that the couple had a tempestuous relationship.

Three of Russell's friends told National Public Radio's Laura Sullivan that Tsarnaev would often insult Russell and call her names, such as 'slut' and 'prostitute.'

He was known to fly into into fits of rage where he would throw objects, including furniture, friends said.

Tsarnaev was shot during a dramatic gunbattle with cops in Watertown, Massachusetts on Friday, before police said he was run over by his younger brother Dzhokhar as he tried to escape.
