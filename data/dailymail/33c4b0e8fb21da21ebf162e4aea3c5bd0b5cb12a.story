England's bid to qualify for the Under 17 European Championships got off to a perfect start on Saturday with a 3-1 win over Norway at Burton Albion's Pirelli Stadium.

Goals from Daniel Wright, Danny Collinge and Layton Ndukwu carried the Young Lions to victory in the first of three crucial Elite Round qualifiers this week.

John Peacock's side are the defending European champions, having beaten Holland on penalties in last May's final in Malta to lift the trophy for the second time.

England coach John Peacock is hoping to lead his team to the European Championship finals in Bulgaria 

With home advantage in this final batch of qualifiers, England started as strong favourites to overcome Norway, Slovenia and Romania in their mini-group and reach the finals in Bulgaria.

And they had the perfect start here when Sunderland man Wright smashed the ball home from six yards after Norway goalkeeper Kjetil Haug could only palm Nathan Holland's cross into his path.

Their lead, however, lasted just seven minutes. The England defence switched off and Andreas Helmersen broke away down the left before squaring for striker Risa Birk to tap in.

The remainder of the first-half was an open affair, but the hosts created the better chances. Leicester man Ndukwu twice struck the crossbar and Chelsea forward Ike Ugbo was denied by the Norway keeper when clean through.

England deserved a goal and it duly arrived on 57 minutes when captain Reece Oxford headed down a corner and Collinge, who plays for Stuttgart in Germany, spin to fire home from five yards.

And victory was secured five minutes later when Ndukwu collected the ball wide left, advanced towards goal and finished from a tight angle.

With one win under their belts, England now head to Chesterfield to play Slovenia on Monday night before rounding off the Elite Round qualifiers against Romania at Burton on Thursday. 

Peacock urged his team to build on this positive performance and kick on: 'I thought we were really good. They had a game plan, and I don’t think there were any real surprises from the Norwegians, we expected them to play like that and we’ve worked hard on that in training.

'We got off to a great start, then had a bit of a blip when we conceded, but in terms of the reaction it was really positive.

'I thought we played really well. The way we passed it about and controlled possession, not forcing things, it was good to see and we produced good football at times.

'That’s what we want to see from this group as they have the capability to do that – it’s just important we build on it.'
