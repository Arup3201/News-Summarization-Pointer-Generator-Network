Prime Minister David Cameron hopes to woo UKIP voters with his promise of an in-out EU referendum if he wins the 2015 general election

David Cameron has ordered a ‘war on two fronts’ to counter the duel threat of Labour and UKIP between now and the general election.The Prime Minister hopes to counter the threat of UKIP with a ‘blue-on-purple’ battle focused on reviving his bid to legislated for an in-out EU referendum.

And he will target Ed Miliband in a ‘blue-on-red’ over the stewardship of the economy and exploiting voters’ doubts about the Labour leader’s ability to run the country.

In a major boost for the Prime Minister, it was announced today that a backbench Tory MP will launch a second bid to enshrine the pledge of an in-out EU referendum in law.

Former minister Bob Neill was the highest placed Conservative MP drawn at random this morning.

He will resurrect the EU Referendum Bill unsuccessfully proposed by colleague James Wharton in the last parliamentary session.

Mr Neill said: ‘One of the first votes I ever cast was on EU membership in the 1970s .

‘Now, as I pick up my bus pass, I am getting the chance to work with colleagues to secure a referendum for the British people.

‘Britain needs a new deal with Europe and the Conservatives have a plan for change in Europe - renegotiate, reform and put the deal to the British people in an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.

‘Parliament now has the chance to pass my backbench bill and guarantee that the British people have the final say.’

Some Conservatives complain that Mr Cameron’s promise of a referendum, first made in January last year, has failed to cut through to voters.

He vowed to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU before putting it to the British public.

It is seen as a key weapon in the attack on UKIP’s support base. Tory strategists have set a deadline of the party conference season in October to build the foundation for an outright majority at the general election in May next year.

The Conservatives have been buoyed by winning the Newark by-election, despite Mr Farage’s claims his People’s Army was on the march to an historic victory.

Many Tory MPs are privately delighted that the party won on an optimistic message of a ‘brighter future’, which had echoes of Mr Cameron’s early leadership when he declared: ‘Let sunshine win the day.’

The Prime Minister has told aides to fight a war on two fronts: targeting Ed Miliband's Labour party and Nigel Farage's UKIP 

Number 10 was especially struck by a poll from Newark which showed support for UKIP was much weaker among women.

Meanwhile, the Tories will contrast Mr Cameron with Mr Miliband, with polls showing barely a quarter of voters think the Labour is up to the of being Prime Minister.

A source close to Mr Cameron told MailOnline: ‘The PM describes it as a war on two fronts.

Tory MP Bob Neill is to try to legislate for an in-out referendum, in the face of opposition from the Lib Dems and Labour

‘Between now and the conference season we have got to show we are more economically competent than Labour and set out a more optimistic vision than UKIP.

‘It is blue-on-red and blue-on-purple. Over the next few months you will see much more about what we would without being in coalition.’

The Prime Minister has said he is ready to invoke the Parliament Act to force through referendum legislation, after Mr Wharton’s bill collapsed in January in the face of Labour and Liberal Democrat opposition in the Lords.

The Tories have been forced to fall back on private members’ legislation as their Lib Dem coalition partners have refused to sanction a Government bill, which would have much greater prospects of success.

For the Parliament Act to apply, a bill identical to that proposed by Mr Wharton would have to pass the Commons without any amendments - which may prove difficult to achieve.

Even if the Conservatives cannot get a bill into law, Tory strategists believe they can still gain by forcing Labour and the Lib Dems to vote against a measure that is popular with many voters just months - or weeks - before a general election if they want to block it. 

Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, said: ‘Voters support a referendum, business supports a referendum and so must Parliament.

‘The EU has changed dramatically over the past 40 years and the overwhelming message from the European elections is that voters want their chance to have a say.

‘This Private Members’ Bill provides a genuine opportunity to give people that chance, which is why MPs must not only back this Bill, but they should not be afraid to use the Parliament Act if peers fail to give the public what they want.’
