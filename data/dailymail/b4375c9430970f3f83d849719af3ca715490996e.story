Kim Jong-Un has told North Korea's military to prepare for war against the United States, saying he wants 'to tear to pieces the Stars and Stripes'.

He also said that America does not have a 'monopoly' on nuclear weapons, adding: 'The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks its mainland is safe.'

The comments were made yesterday after America and South Korea held joint military exercises before announcing another eight-week operation due to take place from Monday.

Kim Jong Un said that America does not have the 'monopoly' on nuclear weapons, adding that: 'The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks its mainland is safe.'

The North Korean dictator called on the army to increase the training of elite units in response to joint military drills from the U.S. and South Korea on Friday

The aggressive North Korean statement comes at a time of rising tension on the peninsula after the communist state also upped its own military drills (pictured, Kim inspects part of a museum in Pyongyang)

Operation Foal Eagle will involve around 200,000 South Korean troops and another 3,700 U.S. personnel, spread over land, sea and air. 

North Korea has also recently stepped up its own ground, air and naval drills, as tensions continue to rise on the fraught peninsula.

KCNA, the country's state news agency, said: 'The DPRK will wage a merciless sacred war against the U.S. now that the latter has chosen confrontation.

'The prevailing situation where a great war for national reunification is at hand requires all the KPA (Korean People's Army) units to become (elite) Guard Units fully prepared for war politically and ideologically, in military technique and materially.'

Kim hit out on the same day the U.S. moved a step closer to imposing new sanctions on North Korea's banks, blocking their access to hard cash.

Kim said he wanted 'to tear to pieces the Stars and Stripes' and 'wage a merciless sacred war against the U.S.', according to the country's state news agency

The comments also came as the U.S. begins ratifying new laws which will place even tougher sanctions on North Korea, limiting its access to hard cash

The bill also has that ability to sanction North Korea officials over dire human rights abuses and individuals who facilitate cyberattacks on the U.S.

The new legislation is partly in response to demands for tougher measures over Pyongyang's nuclear programme and the alleged hack of Sony Pictures last year.

The Obama administration last month blacklisted additional North Korean officials  in response to the Sony hack,aimed at reducing the country's income from illegal weapon sales.

Last week a U.N. panel investigating how North Korea avoids sanctions reported that one shipping company caught trying to smuggle jets and missiles from Cub had simply renamed its vessels, suggesting that the new sanctions may not be entirely effective. 

South Korea and America will carry out more joint exercises from Monday involving hundreds of thousands of troops (pictured, Kim inspects the construction site of a new science and technology centre)
