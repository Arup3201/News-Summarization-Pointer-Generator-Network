She's the pop star turned designer who proved her critics wrong by launching a successful  brand loved by A-listers and fashion editors alike.

Victoria Beckham's collections get stronger each season and now, it looks like she's got yet another fashion hit on her hands.

The womenswear designer has unveiled her spring/summer 2015 range from her Victoria, Victoria Beckham line - and it's full of Bauhaus-inspired print shirts, playsuits and classic shift dresses.

Victoria Beckham has unveiled her SS15 Victoria, Victoria Beckham range - her sister line

Victoria, Victoria Beckham is described as 'the playful younger sister to the style icon's eponymous main line'.

The mother-of-four's new campaign was shot in a gym in New York and each item has been designed to flatter the female form - something Mrs Beckham has made her signature. 

The vibrant and Japanese wave painting-inspired pieces, which are experimental in cut and texture, are a departure from the classic muted dresses she launched her design career with. 

Her latest drop of dresses come with gathered corset waists, plenty of ruffles and asymmetric hemlines. 

Prices range between £480 for a vibrant pink shift to £1,295 for a cami top and pleated midi combo.

The designer has incorporated spots, abstract prints and fluid shapes into the range

Speaking about her latest drop, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Victoria Beckham's main line collections are terribly chic, streamlined and usually contain very little print. 

So it's always nice to see something completely different from her sister line, Victoria, Victoria Beckham.

'For spring summer 2015, there is more of the fluid, looser shapes that we've enjoyed from Victoria over the last couple of seasons. 

'A nice move away from her super tailored pieces. And it's colour and print galore! Spots, abstract prints, orange and pink, and those gorgeous iridescent metallic skirts.

The mother-of-four's new campaign was shot in a gym in New York and is fresh and fun 

'Black is obviously present, it wouldn't be a Victoria Beckham collection without. But here, we're seeing more flesh on show, with a crop top and skirt combo.

'It seems the VVB girl isn't afraid of making a statement through her wardrobe, and for spring she's channeling an uber-cool rock chick with a bit of sophistication thrown in.'

The collection comes after Victoria showed her witty side starring in Vogue.com's 73 Questions series. 

As part of the fashion bible's video interview series she revealed her favourite drink, her best fashion secret and why she never smiles - and became an online sensation.

She has also helped boost the sales of a fledgling business after posting a snap of her wearing a football backpack on Instagram. 

Husband and wife team Tony, 44, and Chloe Brown, 42, launched Sportpax - a range of sports backpacks - in November 2014.

On a whim they sent a £24.99 bag to Victoria and admit they never really expected it to come to anything. However, on Wednesday they woke to an influx of messages about the bag after the designer shared the snap online.

Tony and Chloe had barely got their social media accounts live at the time, but have since rushed to let the social media spheres know who they are.

Their plan is to also launch rugby, cricket and tennis versions. They're in talks with a number of retailers to sell the bags in stores across the country and believe the potential for partnerships with sporting businesses and clubs is 'huge'.
