A  'sexy' Czech hunter who was criticised after posting sickening selfies with her big game trophies has ignored calls to stop - and uploaded  a video showing how to cook zebra.

Michaela Fialova travels all over the world to hunt and regularly posts pictures on Facebook of herself with the dead animals.

She has been slammed for the photos and a campaign was even launched to close down the 27-year-old's page and ban her from entering Africa.

But the brunette has caused further outrage after continuing to gloat about fresh kills including giraffe and zebra.

Michaela Fialova, who was criticised after posting sickening selfies with her big game trophies on Facebook, has ignored calls for her to stop - and uploaded a video showing how to cook zebra 

In the video the 27-year-old can be seen preparing zebra and impala steaks in a small kitchen

Ms Fialova, who has been hunting since she was 13 years old, has already travelled to Slovakia and Hungary this year, where she shot boar, capercaillie and muflon.

She is currently in South Africa and has already posted pictures of herself with a giraffe, hyena and water buck. 

The brunette, who is from Litomerice, Czech Republic, spends the rest of her time working as a personal trainer, kick-boxer and guide for other hunters in Africa and Europe.

She described hunting as 'memories that will last a lifetime'.

Other 'trophies' Ms Fialova has posed next to include this beautiful, endangered lion

The pictures show the weapons Ms Fialova uses, including several different guns and even a crossbow

She wrote on her page earlier this year: 'Have you ever dreamed of hunting in Africa but always thought you couldn't afford it?

'For the price of a good Elk or Red stag, you can go to Africa and take a few animals for the same price and have memories that will last a lifetime.' 

Ms Fialova is sometimes snapped brandishing the trophies alongside female friends, but in one is seen kissing an ex-boyfriend while holding a monkey.

She gains most of her ammunition and clothing through sponsoring. Her page has already gained more than 20,500 'likes'.

In some the Czech brunette stands next to her trophies. But in others, like this one, she gives the photographer a 'thumbs up' 

She wrote on her page: 'For the price of a good Elk or Red stag, you can go to Africa and take few animals for the same price and have memories that will last a lifetime'

Her antics have resulted in an online petition on website change.org titled 'Ban Michaela Michaelka Fialova from Africa and shut down her Facebook page promoting trophy hunting as being a glamorous thing to do'. 

It was created by Alice Harding, from Dartmouth, England, who described hunting as 'despicable'.

She said: 'It's repulsive to glorify trophy hunting and sadistic practices such as bow hunting and posing with dead bodies of animals as if hunting is an appealing and desirable thing to do.

'Killing animals for fun is just plain wrong and must be stopped.'

A petition has been set up on change.org to stop Ms Fialova. It reads: 'It's despicable and repulsive to glorify trophy hunting and sadistic practices such as bow hunting'

Ms Fialova, posing above with a boar in Slovakia, has vowed she will never stop hunting and refers to those against it as 'antis' 

But despite criticism Ms Fialova, who refers to those against hunting as 'antis', wrote on Facebook on February 24: 'Hey antis, do you really think this will stop me? I WILL NEVER STOP HUNTING.'

And in a video posted at the beginning of March, she explained: 'The difference between this meat and your meat is your meat is usually from slaughterhouses.

'The animal has a right to live a proper life and until its end it doesn't know about being hunted' (sic). 

The petition was started on February 18 and has been signed by nearly 6,000 supporters.
