Andy Murray trained with Amelie Mauresmo on Friday morning as he prepares to defend his Wimbledon title.

Practising his shot, the 27-year-old and his new coach seemed to be in a fairly laid-back mood ahead of the competition which starts on Monday.

Murray and Mauresmo were all smiles as they laughed and joked whilst taking a breather during Friday's training session.

Murray has been handed a favourable draw to begin his Wimbledon title defence and will face Belgian David Goffin in the first round, who is a talented ball striker but has made his biggest career impression on clay.

The defending Wimbledon champion is in the same half as Novak Djokovic, who pulled out of an exhibition match to rest his troublesome wrist on Thursday, with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal on the other side.

Murray could have a major headache in the quarter finals where he could come up against last Sundayâ€™s Aegon champion Grigor Dimitrov or the relentless Spanish scrapper David Ferrer.

The Scot first expected seed in the third round is Roberto Bautista Agut, although it could be the in-form German Tobias Kamke instead. His scheduled fourth round opponent could be tough, the big-serving South African Kevin Anderson but overall it could have come out worse.

Team effort: Murray and his coaches share a joke during Friday's training session in SW19

Favourable draw: Murray will face Belgian David Goffin in the first round of the Men's Singles
