This is the shocking moment a pedestrian has his mobile phone snatched out of his hand - by a man racing past on a bike.

The 41-year-old victim was walking along the pavement and using his mobile when it was grabbed from his hands in a split-second by a passing cyclist, who then sped off down the street.

The incident, which was captured on CCTV, happened at around 5pm on January 26, in central London.

The suspect is described as a white male, who was wearing a grey hoodie and white tracksuit bottoms.

City of London Police Inspector Doug Blackwood warned people not to 'walk and text' and remain vigilant when using their phones outside. 

He said: 'We advise the public to be vigilant when using their phone out and about on the street in London.

'Try not to walk and text at the same time, not only does it put you at risk of injury, the distraction of texting also leaves you vulnerable.

'If you really need to make a phone call in a public place, try and keep the conversation as brief as possible.'
