House Speaker John Boehner told the nation's leader in a face-to-face meeting on Friday in no uncertain terms that he could kiss real reforms to the immigration system goodbye if he followed through on his plans to give up to 11 million illegal immigrants amnesty.

A statement from Boehner's office after today's White House meeting with congressional leaders says 'the speaker warned that unilateral action by the president on executive amnesty will erase any chances of doing immigration reform and will also make it harder for Congress and the White House to work together successfully on other areas where there might otherwise be common ground.'

In a statement of its own after the strategy session the White House said that Obama still intends to act before the end of the year, regardless of the GOP's opposition to the move.

Speaker of the House John Boehner, right, told President Barack Obama to his face today during a luncheon that acting on immigration through executive order would have significant costs

No more Mr. Nice Guy: Boehner of Ohio told reporters yesterday during a Capitol Hill  press conference that Obama was playing with fire when it came to immigration and he well on his way to getting burned

At the meeting, the White House said, the president 'reiterated his commitment to taking action on immigration reform in light of the House’s inability to pass a comprehensive bill.'

Before the post-election summit White House Press Secretary told reporters that the president has given House Republicans 'ample' time to pass reforms preferred by the president, yet Boehner declined to bring a version of the Senate-passed immigration bill, which includes those changes, to floor.

And yesterday, Earnest said, Boehner refused to put forward a timeline for when House Republicans would pass any sort of immigration legislation at all.

'So it’s hard to take seriously this suggestion that Republicans actually do want to work with the president to pass immigration reform,' Earnest said.  

'There is one thing they can do to prevent the president from taking executive action,' Earnest said, and that is to 'allow that common sense, bipartisan bill passed by the Senate to come to the floor of the House of Representatives.

'If the House passes that Senate bill, the president won’t take executive action.'

The Obama spokesman said that even if House Republicans do not act in the 'best interest in the country, the president’s not going to miss that opportunity.'

Several hours after the meeting, other attendees of the luncheon with Obama had not issued statements with the exception of Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican.

Remaining silent were Senate Majority Leader Senator Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, House Majority Kevin McCarthy and House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer.

Similarly mum were lower ranking lawmakers in the meeting, Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune,·House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra, Vice Chair of the Democratic Conference in the Senate Chuck Schumer, Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray and Republican Policy Committee Chairman John Barrasso.

In his statement Cornyn said he, too, 'made clear to the President that we should tackle immigration reform together on a step-by-step basis, beginning with border security and respect for the rule of law.'

'Unfortunately the President’s promise to unilaterally go around Congress ignores the message voters sent on Election Day,,' he said, referring to the GOP's victories at the ballot box on Tuesday. 

'It is my sincere hope that he will reverse course and work with us – not around us – to secure the border and achieve real reforms to our immigration system.'

According to the White House the president and Capitol Hill lawmakers also discussed 'emergency' Ebola funding that the president requested from Congress this week and the need for the legislative branch to pass a new budget  'in the same bipartisan, drama-free way they did earlier this year.'

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Office of Management and Budget Director Shawn Donovan and U.S. Central Command head General Lloyd Austin also briefed the group on the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, the White House aid, and requested an additional $5.6 billion from them to support the military mission.

The Pentagon today announced that it would be sending 1,500 more troops overseas to train Iraqi security forces. 

Boehner's office said other topics of discussion the 'more than 40 House-passed jobs bills' targeted at creating jobs and jump starting the economy and the creation of a new Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) for military engagement in Iraq.

The White House maintains that it does not need new congressional authority to bomb Islamic militants, arguing that a decade-old AUMF issued by the legislature in the wake of the Iraq war is enough, but a bipartisan cadre of representatives has openly disagreed. 

The Speaker's office said Boehner today 'urged' the president to send in a new request to satisfy those concerns 

In a preview of today's meeting, Boehner suggested to reporters yesterday that he would confront Obama about his ill-advised plans to act on immigration.

'When you play with matches, you take the risk of burning yourself,' Boehner said Thursday during a Washington, D.C. press conference. 'And he's going to burn himself if he continues to go down this path.'

The GOP leader was responding at the time to Obama's commitment on Wednesday 'to take whatever lawful actions' he can to make changes to the deportation process - with or without the permission of Congress.

'I've consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill,' Obama said during a press conference on Wednesday. 'I think it's fair to say that I've shown a lot of patience and tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible and will keep doing so.'

But in the absence of congressional action, Obama again promised to make his own reforms. The president has not said what moves he's considering, but White House officials have indicated that anywhere between one and 11 million illegal immigrants could be allowed to stay in the U.S. as a direct result. 

Challenging Boehner, Obama said on Wednesday, 'You send me a bill that I can sign and those executive actions go away. 

'What we can't do is just keep on waiting,' he argued. 'There's a cost for waiting.'

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is slated to become Majority Leader of the Senate in January, said Wednesday that Obama was taking the wrong approach to altering the nation's broken immigration system.

'I think the president choosing to do a lot of things unilaterally on immigration would be a big mistake,' McConnell told reporters during a press conference out of Kentucky, where he had just been reelected to his Senate seat the night before.

'It's an issue that most of my members want to address legislatively and it's like waving a red flag in front of a bull to say, "If you guys don't do what I want, I'm going to do it on my own."

'I hope he won't do that because I do think it poisons the well for the opportunity to address a very important domestic issue,' McConnell said.

Boehner reiterated McConnell's observation on Thursday, saying if Obama acts on his own will to 'poison the well' for broader reforms to the immigration process 'and there will be no chance for immigration reform moving in this Congress. 

'The American people made it clear Election Day, they want to get things done, and they don't want the president acting on a unilateral basis,' Boehner said. 

The House Speaker, who has long said he's in favor of reforming the immigration system in a step-by-step fashion rather than the president's preferred comprehensive method, said he was doing his best to come up with a package that all parties involved could agree to. 

'I could regale you with all of my challenges of trying to get members on both sides of the aisle to deal with this. They were numerous. But hope springs eternal,' he said.

The White House said in a statement after today's meeting with congressional leaders that he still intends to issue his own set of immigration rules.  Attendees of today's summit are pictured here from left to right are: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, House Speaker John Boehner, Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Sen.

The Republican legislator signaled on Thursday that the post-election Kumbaya between the White House and Republicans, at least as far as he is concerned, is already over, just two days after the midterm election that gave his party a historic number of seats in Congress.

'My job is not to get along with the president, just to get along with him, although we actually have a nice relationship,' Boehner told reporters. 'My job is to listen to my members and listen to the American people and make their priorities our priorities.'

As Boehner was pledging on Capitol Hill to stand his ground, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was assuring reporters at his daily briefing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue that the president is dedicated to finding 'common ground' with Republicans in Congress.

The president looks forward to meeting with Boehner and other congressional leaders for lunch tomorrow at the White House, Earnest said, suggesting that a new era of bipartisanship could be on the way in Washington.

Boehner seemed suspicious on Thursday at his own briefing, across town, that the Democratic president actually intends to compromise with Republicans.

'Finding common ground is going to be hard work, but it will be even harder if the president isn’t willing to work with us,' Boehner said.
