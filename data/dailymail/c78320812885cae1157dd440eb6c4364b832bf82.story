'Give Valentine credit - that was an incredible shot,' Ohio State coach Thad Matta said. 'I thought we had them right where we wanted them in terms of how the action developed.' 

Ohio State's Sam Thompson had made a three-pointer for the Buckeyes, tying the game with 36 seconds left, but Michigan State patiently ran the clock down, and Valentine had room to shoot.

'I was ready to hit the shot,' Valentine said. 'I didn't want to go into another overtime.' 

Michigan State has gone to overtime five times this season, losing three of those games. 

The Buckeyes  rallied from being behind nine points at the half, and even after Valentine's big shot, Ohio State had a chance to send the game to overtime, but they lost the ball on the ensuing inbound pass.

Freshman Lourawls 'Tum Tum' Nairn played 36 minutes for Michigan State, scoring seven points with five rebounds and four assists - including the pass to set up Valentine's winning shot.

It was another tense finish between Ohio State and Michigan State. Of the last eight meetings between the teams, seven have been decided by four points or fewer

The Buckeyes began closing the halftime gap in earnest toward the middle of the second half, tying it at 46 on a dunk by Thompson and taking a 49-47 lead on a jumper by Scott with 5:22 remaining.

Valentine's three-pointer with four minutes to play put the Spartans up by one, and a layup by Trice with 1:16 left gave Michigan State a 56-53 lead. 

Tate missed a three at the other end, but the Spartans couldn't secure the rebound. Thompson tied it with his first three-pointer of the game.

It was another tense finish between Ohio State and Michigan State. Of the last eight meetings between the teams, seven have been decided by four points or fewer.

'I think you can literally start your own classics channel from the last few years of Ohio State versus Michigan State games,' Matta said. 'The endings have been incredible.' 

Michigan State beat a Top 25 team for the first time in five tries this season. The Spartans lost by five to Kansas and in double overtime to Maryland, but this victory will certainly help their resume.
