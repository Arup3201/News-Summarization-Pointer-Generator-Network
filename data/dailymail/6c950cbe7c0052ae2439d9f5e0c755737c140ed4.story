A heavily-pregnant mother was attacked on her doorstep as she held her one-year-old child in her arms in a case of mistaken identity.

The 33-year-old woman, who is eight-and-a-half months pregnant, was punched in the face after answering her door to three men in Portsmouth, causing her to bleed over her toddler.

The men - all white and aged in their 30s - were looking for a man last Friday afternoon who had previously lived at the property, claiming he owed them money, Hampshire Constabulary said.

Attack: The 33-year-old woman, who is eight-and-a-half months pregnant, was punched in the face after answering her door to three men on this road (pictured) in Portsmouth, causing her to bleed over her toddler

But despite the woman explaining she had no link to the man, she was still punched in the face, leaving her badly bruised and bleeding from her nose.

The phone line to the property was later found to have been cut - and detectives condemned the ‘despicable and cowardly’ attack on the mother, which took place between 2.30pm and 2.50pm.

The force said the woman felt ‘shocked and distressed’ and was later treated by ambulance staff.

Detective Constable Peter Bugden said: ‘It would have been obvious to the men she was expecting and also obvious she had a young child in her arms.

‘We are keen to find the three men as soon as possible - especially the attacker.

‘I’d like to hear from anyone who has any information about this assault or who saw the car or anything suspicious at around the time the attack happened.’

The men left in a small dark green two-door car. The attacker is described as stocky with strawberry blond hair. He wore a beige pullover with duffle buttons and had a southern accent.

The road on which the attack happened has an average house value of £135,000 and is located in the Buckland area of Portsmouth, close to the city's ferry port.

Anyone with information is asked to call Fratton CID on 101, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
