The son of a man who was reported missing after going for a swim - but later turned up 700 miles away - has been charged with insurance fraud and filing a false report.

Jonathan Roth, 22, was arrested on Monday, said Nassau County District Attorney's office. He was also charged with conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.

Roth claimed he had nothing to do with the actions of his father, 47-year-old Raymond Roth who allegedly tried to fake his own death.

He vanished on July 28 after going into the water at Jones Beach, New York. The unemployed computer engineer was discovered five days later after being stopped for speeding in South Carolina.

His son had reported him missing causing a massive air and water search, costing thousands of dollars.

Jonathan Roth said yesterday he feared his father was coming to kill him after his stepmother exposed emails she found between the two, detailing a plan to disappear and play dead.

Mrs Roth has since filed for divorce and taken a restraining order against her husband. She also said she was afraid for her life after revealing the information and claims her husband is abusive.

Mr Roth was accused of wasting police time after his son reported that he drifted out to sea. His shoes, clothes, 
wallet and cellphone were all found on Jones Beach.

Jonathan Roth said he never received incriminating emails from his father and that there was no way his stepmother could have had access to the computer.

He denied being involved in Mr Roth's plan and said he still isn't certain why his father wants to kill him.

After Jonathan told
police that his father had disappeared on July 28 during his daily swim at the 
Long Island beach, a huge search operation took place that lasted until last Wednesday.

It was suspended when Mrs Roth came across suspicious emails between the father and son, sent in the days before his disappearance. 

Coincidentally, Mr Roth was pulled over by police in Santee, South Carolina for speeding on Thursday morning.

Mrs Roth says her stepson is lying about his involvement in the disappearance.  According to the emails she discovered, Mr Roth told his son: 'Do Not allow that a**hole to give the house away.'

In the alleged emails, dated from 
the day before the disappearance, Roth wrote to his son: 'I need to 
get to the bank for cash for the trip.'

He added: 'about the jewelry we spoke of 
yesterday, you need to whisper in [a relative’s] ear about it and do not
worry she will get it,' and, 'tell [another relative] I handed you the 
papers -- then you JUST noticed that there was an envelope with [his] 
name on it (the last Will and Testemnet [sic]) then hand it to him.'

In the emails seen by the New York Post, Mr Roth sent his son three messages within ten minutes on the morning of Friday, July 27.

spot where he went missing

In the first email, Mr Roth instructs his son to call him with an update on Sunday.

'There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8pm at the resort,' explained Mr Roth.

'You cannot call from your phone,’ the father allegedly warned. 'Go to a pay phone or borrow your friends phone. 

'You must call within 15 minutes of the determined call time in order to be sure I will be available.'

His wife said during the press conference last week: 'On the day he went to the beach, he told me he was going to his mother’s house.

'I said, ''How long are you going to be? Are you going to be home for dinner?''

'He said, ''I’ll be home in an hour.'''

Three hours later, her stepson Jonathan called to tell her that her husband had not come out of the water and was presumed drowned.

Nassau County police confirmed that Jonathan Roth dialled 911 to report his father missing near Jones Beach’s Field 6 where there are no lifeguards.

A
neighbor of the family said that he saw Jonathan after his father had been missing for two days and that the man told him, 'My dad’s 
gone, my dad’s dead.'
