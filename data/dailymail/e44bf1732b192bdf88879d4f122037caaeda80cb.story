A 10-year-old girl died needlessly after a catalogue of serious blunders at a much-criticised hospital.

Arina Durbazeva had suffered from epilepsy since she was one and and died of a heart attack when staff at Basildon Hospital were unable to stop her fitting.

An inquest into Arina’s death heard that junior doctors were unable to administer drugs to the her because they were past their use by date.

Arina Durbazeva, 10, was taken to Basildon Hospital after she had an epileptic fit. Due to a catalogue of errors, doctors failed to stop her fitting and she suffered a heart attack. She died two days later

No senior doctors were on the ward after 5pm and the on-call locum consultant chose to stay at home when he was contacted.

Chelmsford Coroners’ Court was told Arina suffered an epileptic seizure at her school but it had been stopped thanks to an anti-seizure drug.

She was rushed to Basildon Hospital where she suffered a second seizure soon after arriving at 4.20pm on October 12 last year. A series of errors meant it was not controlled. 

Arina suffered a heart attack at 6.05pm and stopped breathing for 14 minutes.

She was rushed to St Mary’s Hospital, London, but died two days later.

The coroner recorded a narrative verdict, meaning she could not attribute the death to a named individual.

Arina's father, Arkadiys Durbazeva 
said: 'There is a void in our understanding of how a situation as dire 
as this was allowed to exist in a hospital.'

He
 told the inquest he disputed hospital records and believes his 
daughter's seizure could have lasted for as long as an hour and 45 
minutes.

After her heart attack, Arina was taken to St Mary's Hospital in London but doctors there were unable to save her. The coroner recorded a narrative verdict meaning no individual could be held responsible for her death

He said: 'There are definite discrepancies between our understanding and the definitions of certain events given and the time scales.

'Unless we get satisfactory answers, we reserve the right to seek further responses.'

Hospital bosses have now apologised to Arina’s devastated family.

Clare Panniker, chief executive of the hospital trust, said: ‘I want to say how sorry I am that we failed to provide the best care for Arina.

‘I also want to assure her family that she will not be forgotten and will remain at the forefront of our minds as we seek to improve the care we provide to all our patients.’

Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray was told of the hospital’s failings which let Arina down.

These included an ‘inexperienced’ medic struggling to mix a dose of the necessary drug which had been successful in stopping Arina’s seizure when she was at school.

Junior doctors on the ward decided 
against using three other types of drug after the initial treatment 
failed because they were past their use by dates.

When Arina was at Basildon hospital there were no senior doctors on the ward and an on-call consultant was contacted but decided to stay at home

But investigations later concluded that they should have attempted to use the drugs anyway.

And despite Arina’s rapidly deteriorating condition, there were repeated delays in alerting an on-call consultant. 

Doctor Rotimi Jaiyesimi, Basildon Hospital's director of patient safety, carried out an internal investigation into the incident.

He told the inquest questions were raised about the decision of the on-call consultant Dr Mohamed Ramadan to stay at home.

He said: 'The consultant should have probed further about the deterioration. It is difficult for me to comment on his decision to stay at home.'

Dr Ramadan no longer works for the trust and is now based in Libya so was not called to give evidence.

The coroner, Caroline Beasley-Murray, also heard that doctors at Basildon Hospital were unable to give Arina the drugs she needed because they were past their use by date

A post-mortem concluded the 
schoolgirl died from multiple organ failure caused by epilepsy, an 
associated brain problem and obesity.

Following Arina’s death there have been two independent reviews and a plan put in place to prevent a repeat of the tragedy.

Improvements
 include regular drug date checks, consultants remaining on site until 
9pm and ‘tailor-made’ care plans for patients with complex medical 
conditions.

Mrs Beasley-Murray said: ‘I am pleased to see there have been some improvements in places but they must be on-going and must be implemented.

‘There is no point having an action plan unless it is implemented fully so little girls like this much-loved little girl are not at risk.’

The hospital claims that since Arina’s death, there have been major changes.

Mrs Panniker said: ‘We have worked tirelessly to learn lessons from Arina’s death and, as a result, the care we provide for children has been transformed.

‘A review of the way we manage medicines had also been undertaken to ensure they are available and in stock at all times.’

After Arina’s death, the Care Quality Commission branded children’s services at the hospital ‘completely unacceptable’.

In a statement the trust said: ‘Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust would like to send its condolences to the family of Arina Durbazeva at this difficult time.

‘We are sorry we failed to provide the care that Arina needed and have worked tirelessly to learn lessons from her death.

‘Two independent reviews of paediatric services have taken place at the Trust and as a result the care we provide to children has been transformed.

‘We now employ higher numbers of specialist paediatric nurses and three additional consultants and have changed the way some children access paediatric services out of hours to ensure that they are safe at all times.

‘A review of the way we manage medicines has also been undertaken to ensure they are available and in stock at all times.’
