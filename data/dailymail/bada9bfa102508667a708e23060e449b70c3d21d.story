A brave vicar grabbed a thug by the throat after he demanded money on his vicarage doorstep

Reverend Simon Treloar, 53, grabbed attacker Jason Haynes, 32, by the throat after the criminal, who had been released from prison just that day, tried to force his way in.

Reverend Treloar said: 'I might be a clergyman but I am not a doormat. I did what I had to do - but,of course, I forgive him.

'People think Christianity is a soft touch but that's what the benefits agency is for.'

The Dean of St Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Wrexham, North Wales, kept Haynes at arms length and forced him out of his house before calling the police.

The attempted theft comes almost a year after Father Treloar thwarted an attempt to smash a bottle into his face.

Reverend Treloar said: 'You just have to deal with what you are confronted with. Yes, there was aslight sense of deja vu but it is important to be calm.

'My biggest concern was thinking what if this had happened to someone else.'

Neither incident has dampened his community spirit. Reverend Treloar said: 'I am happy to keep serving the community in Wrexham for as long as my bishop wants me to.

'The vast majority of people here are very welcoming.'

And Reverend Treloar refuses to live in fear of further attacks, saying: 'I can't stop living just because of a couple of idiots.'

The dean's bravery came to light at Mold Crown Court after Haynes was jailed for a year for assault and breaching his ASBO.

Judge Rhys Rowlands told Haynes: 'You just quite deliberately ignore court orders. You go out and get drunk, make a thorough nuisance of yourself.

'You have an appalling record for disorder, dishonesty and violence.'
