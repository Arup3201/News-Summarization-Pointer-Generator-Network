North Koreans took to the streets of Pyongyang today to mark the official start of Kim Jong Un's reign - as a hacking group managed to shut down the premiere of a film showing his assassination.

Horns and sirens sounded in the oppressed country to mark the end of a mourning period for the dictator's father, Kim Jong Il, who died three years ago.

The ceremony - in line with a Korean custom of mourning one's parents for three years - marks the true commencement of the younger ruler's reign, as the last vestiges of his father's regime fade.

Solemn: North Koreans bowed their head in a final act of respect towards Kim Jong Il, whose official mourning period of three years is now over

Assassination: The Interview depicts the graphic death by explosion of the dictator

My time: Kim Jong Un is now more free to rule the country his way after the mourning period 

The expression of continuity in the North Korean regime comes as thousands of American movie theaters back out of screening The Interview - a controversial film in which Kim Jong Un is killed.

Leaked versions of the pivotal scene show the dictator's head exploding after a missile hits his helicopter and engulfs him in flame.

Anger over the depiction of the brutal assassination caused a hacking cell called Guardian of Peace to launch a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, leaking thousands of damaging documents. The group also threatened terrorist attacks on the United States.

The move led cinema chains - including the New York City location due to host the premiere - to pull out of showing the film after the hackers promised 9/11-style attacks.

Not backing down: Sony has also said that despite the threat, they will still be distributing the film

Officials at the Department of Homeland Security have said the attacks are not credible - but many theaters have still decided to back away from screenings.

Meanwhile in Pyongyang, trains, ships and cars sounded their horns and masses of North Koreans fell silent for three minutes as they bowed toward the mausoleum where Kim Jong Il and his father, 'eternal president' Kim Il Sung, lie in state.

The younger Kim may now be more likely to initiate new policies that underscore his own priorities and goals, though it is believed that major departures from his father's path are unlikely.

Since the death of his father, Kim Jong Un has indicated he wants to build the economy and improve the nation's standard of living, but he has also held firm to the North's longstanding - and extremely costly - focus on strengthening its military and developing its nuclear weapons capabilities.

Vast: Citizens of Pyongyang bow in Kim Il Sung Square, where huge pictures of their leaders are displayed

The Guardians of Peace threat released on Tuesday reads:

Warning

We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places The Interview be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to.

Soon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made.

The world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th of September 2001.

We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, you’d better leave.)

Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment.

All the world will denounce the SONY.
