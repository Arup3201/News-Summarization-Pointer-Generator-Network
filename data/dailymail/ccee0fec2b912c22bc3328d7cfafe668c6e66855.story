Jessica Lynch, the former prisoner of war who was rescued 10 years ago today, says the pain of her injuries still remain a decade later, but she is doing the best she can, thanks to perseverance.

She was just 19 years old when she and 11 colleagues were ambushed in Nasiriyah, Iraq, after they had taken a wrong turn and came 
under attack on March 23, 2003.

She had been captured along with five of her fellow officers from the 507th Maintenance Company. By the time of her rescue nine days later, was the lone survivor.

Now 29, the first American female POW is a motivational speaker and substitute teacher, but first and foremost are her responsibilities as a mom to 6-year-old Dakota.

She told the Today show: 'That's where I feel the most pride. I'm not prisoner-of-war Jessica Lynch. I’m Dakota's mommy.'

When asked by Savannah Guthrie if she 
still experiences pain from her battle injuries, Lynch said: Everything 
from the back being broken to both of the legs. I still have to wear a 
brace on the left leg to get around. The right foot keeps giving me 
problems but I do the best that I can.

'[I'm] just thankful that I’m here.'

She said that her memories of the 
Iraq war remain vivid, and she still suffers from survivor's guilt of 
the soldiers who were left behind, namely her best friend, Lori Ann Piestawa.

It's hard. It's so hard to continue every day knowing that Lori didn’t make it home with me. The reason she went over there was to be with me and our other comrades and sadly she didn’t get to come back home.

'So just having to deal with the fact that my best friend didn’t get to come back and I did. And she had two beautiful kids... It’s just really hard to know that they'll have to grow up without their mom.

Ms Lynch says she has nightmares every night that someone is chasing her.

She told Today: 'It's hard. It really is mentally and physically draining.'

When she was rescued, the U.S. government used footage of Ms Lynch to spin a tale that exaggerated the truth. 

To
make her seem more heroic and rally public support for the war, the 
military claimed she'd gone down firing - when, in fact, her rifle had 
jammed.

She says she has done her best to 'set the record straight' on what happened that day.

She told the Today show: 'I know that there was a lot of fabricated and misconstrued stories. I did what I had to do. I came out and I’ve tried to tell the world what really happened. I've set the record straight as much as I can.'

As a motivational speaker, Ms Lynch says the message she seeks to convey during public appearances is that of perseverance.

She told Today: 'Every day I wake up, I 
have that never give up attitude. As much as I have the ups and down 
days - it doesn’t matter as long as you as long as you keep it in your 
mind that you can do anything, you can conquer it.'

Pride: Ms Lynch, left, speaks during her graduation ceremony at West Virginia University at Parkersburg in December 2011

In December 2011, Ms Lynch graduated from West Virginia University at Parkersburg with a degree in education.

She now works as a substitute teacher in Wirt and Wood counties, West Virginia, according to the Parkersburg News and Sentinel.

Ms Lynch had joined the Army at 18 to earn money for college and become a school teacher.

She wrote a book, 'I Am A Soldier, 
Too,' with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Rick Bragg, and has 
repeatedly worked to set the record straight.

'The
bottom line is the American people are capable of determining their own
ideals of heroes,' she told Congress in 2007, 'and they don't need to 
be told elaborate lies.'
