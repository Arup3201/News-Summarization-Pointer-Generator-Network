When Ian Carroll asked council contractors why they were herding Canada geese into a van at a park, he was not satisfied by their claim to be ringing the birds’ feet.

Mr Carroll, 39, contacted the park ranger but remained unconvinced by his assurance the birds were being relocated to a country park - even after the ranger sent him a picture of them supposedly being released.

So the postman, who is a member of a local animal rescue group, lodged a Freedom of Information Act request with Sandwell Council, which finally admitted the geese had been taken away and ‘humanely’ killed.

The park ranger told Mr Carroll that the geese, pictured, were being relocated to a county park. He later sent Mr Carroll a photo to prove it

The West Midlands authority has now admitted it removed and killed 220 Canada geese from parks in Tipton and West Bromwich in 2013 and 2014, using a licensed pest control firm.

The removals including the geese and goslings filmed by Mr Carroll in Victoria Park, Tipton in summer last year.

Mr Carroll said yesterday: ‘I can’t believe they could lie to me like that. We still haven’t found out how they killed them. They could have been shot, gassed or had their necks broken.’

He added: ‘I have spent the last 17 years rescuing swans and wildfowl in Sandwell who have been maimed by other animals thugs. But this action by the council is worse than all of these incidents put together.

But Mr Carroll, a postman, did not believe the ranger's explanation and sent a Freedom of Information request about the geese, pictured, to Sandwell Council, which is responsible for the park 

‘The birds have been rounded up and killed during the molting season when they loose their flight feathers and were unable to get away.’

In large numbers Canada Geese can have a detrimental impact on their environment, producing large numbers of droppings which contain bacteria and phosphates blamed for polluting watercourses, and dispersing native species.

Councillor Maria Crompton said a total of 150 geese were culled from Victoria Park and Dartmouth Park in 2013. Seventy geese were culled from Victoria Park this year.

She said: ‘I’m very sad we had to do this but people’s safety and public health are paramount.

‘We have done this as a last resort and as humanely as possible in response to repeated complaints and real concerns from park users, including parents of young children.’ She said the numbers of geese had ‘got out of control’, with more than 1,000 grazing in Sandwell’s parks.

In 2012 it emerged that more than 11,000 Canada Geese had been culled from parks by Stoke-on-Trent City Council over the previous two years.
