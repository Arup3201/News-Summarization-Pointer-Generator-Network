Asians are the fastest growing race group in the United States, reflecting a surge in immigration from the entire region over a decade, according to the Census Bureau.

Data from the 2010 Census shows that the number of people who identified themselves as Asian alone, and not mixed race, grew by 43.3 per cent from a decade earlier.

That was more than four times faster than the rate of growth for the overall U.S. population, which grew 9.7 per cent in the same period to 308,745,538.

Breaking it down: The circles on each state in the map above provide a visual to show how many Asians are in each state relative to one another. The colors show the country of origin of the majority of the Asians in the given state. Hmong, the pink shading, is an ethnic group that exists in China, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand.

Some 14.7 million people- the equivalent of 4.8 per cent of the country’s total population- identified themselves as Asian alone.

Another 2.6 million, or 0.9 per cent, said they were Asian in combination with another race group, most commonly white.

In spite of the documented growth, Asians still don't make the top three biggest ethnic groups in America: whites are first with 72.4 per cent, then Latinos with 16.3 per cent and African Americans are third with 5.6 per cent.

‘Net international migration is the biggest component of the change in the Asian population,’ said Elizabeth Hoeffel, a Census Bureau spokesman.

For statistical purposes, the United 
States defines an Asian as someone ‘having origins in any of the 
original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian 
subcontinent.’

Those who identified themselves as either Asian alone or Asian mixed with another race grew by at least 30 per cent in all states except Hawaii, where they already made up a majority of the population.

Across the board, every state had an increase in growth of their Asian population.

States with the fastest rate of Asian growth were Nevada (116 per cent), Arizona (95 per cent) and North Carolina (85 per cent).

New York had the biggest Asian population with 1.1 million, followed by Los Angeles (484,000) and San Jose, California (327,000).

A map provided by the Census Bureau shows that while Asians from different home countries have spread throughout the country, it also shows that they tend to move to states near one another.

The fact that Asian Indians tending toward the south and Filipinos gravitating towards the West coast is not surprising as it is comforting to be in an area with a large community of your peers.

The only home country whose descendants spread in a seemingly random manner was that of the Chinese; New York has by far the largest population of the ethnic group, but then their only other appearances are in Oregon, North Dakota, Utah and Colorado.

A larger minority: Asians now rank as the fourth highest ethnic group in the U.S.

The types of jobs available in 
certain regions are thought to be one of the most significant 
explanations for the continued growth of Asian populations in areas like
San Francisco and Silicon Valley.

'There
is a constant need for highly skilled workers here, and you have 
excellent universities with high-tech concentrations in India and China 
that feed that,' said David Lee, the San Francisco Census steering 
committee chair.

'There
are also needs in the pharmaceutical, biotech and health industries 
that fuel Asian immigration, much in the same way the agricultural 
industry fuels Latino immigration,' he told The San Francisco Chronicle.

The quality of education is also a factor, as Asians are one of the best-educated ethnic groups.

'There definitely is a connection Asian people have to education and raising your children well - just as all Americans strive for,' Mr Lee said.

Chinese was the largest of all Asian groups (four million, including 700,000 who identified as mixed race), followed by Filipinos (3.4 million) and Asian Indians (3.2 million).

TOTAL number of Asians in America: 17,320,856American population overall: 311,591,917Asian Indian: 3,183,063 Largely concentrated in the Southeast section of the country, Asian Indians have become much more visible in American politics in recent years. The governors from both South Carolina and Louisiana are of Indian descent. Aside from the south, there are also large Indian populations in New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.Chinese: 4,010,114The largest population of Asians of Chinese descent is unsurprisingly in New York, as New York City alone is home to 445,145 Chinese. The city's Chinatown district is said to be the oldest enclave of chinese outside of mainland China and it dates back to the 1840s.  Filipino: 3,416,840The Census map shows that the Filipino population is largely concentrated in the West coast. Tellingly, Los Angeles County has more Filipinos than any other place int the country. Daly City, however, in the San Francisco Bay area, holds the title for the largest number of Filipinos in one city,  Hmong: 260,073Hmong is an ethnic group tat comes from the mountainous regions throughout Vietnam, China, Laos, and Thailand. Their origin dates back 2,000 years and started in China but began to migrate south in the 18th century because of political instability. America has the largest population of Hmong people outside of Asia, and even beats out Thailand for the title. Vietnamese: 1,737,433Concentrated in the center of the country and the gulf coast, the states with the most significant Vietnamese populations are Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska. Immigration from the south Asian country spiked dramatically in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam War, though the immigrants faced harsh, poor conditions on their arrival.
