Looking for the perfect partner using online dating sites can be like searching for a needle in a haystack.

And while apps such as Tinder allow people to sift through potential dates by looks, a new app lets single people search for love by putting personality first.

Twine Canvas claims to be the first ‘flirting and dating’ app where brains come before beauty.

Brains before beauty: Twine Canvas claims to be the first ‘flirting and dating’ app where people choose whether they are attracted to someone based on their interests instead of their looks. If they are impressed by a person's 'canvas' of hobbies (pictured left) they can show their interest and if it is reciprocated, they can chat

Single users create a 'canvas' instead of using a photo of themselves, to entice would-be dates.

The collage of images is designed to show their personality and interests.

Essential data such as a person's age, location and sex is shown and lets people filter app users.

Users can show their interest in someone's canvas and if it is reciprocated, they can start chatting.

They can also see photos of each other at this point, to check there is physical attraction.

The app’s developers claim the system lets people make ‘real connections’ instead of being seduced by looks alone.

It matches people according to their personalities and interests in the first instance, and only lets them see what their would-be date looks like later on.

California-based developer Spoonjuice, said the free iPhone app is ‘built to help you match with people based on interesting personalities, not just cute faces.’

Instead of choosing a photo to entice people to click on their dating profile, users create a ‘canvas’ of images reflecting their personality and interests, as well as filling in essential data such as their age and location.

The pictures are not designed to give different views of a person’s appearance, but rather pick out activities such as favourite locations, meals and random items like Christmas trees or graffiti to pique the interest of the possible partners.

The anti Tinder? Twine Canvas only lets users see photos of one another - and allows people to start chatting - once they like each other, based upon their canvas of interests (pictured left). The app also suggests questions to ask based on people's hobbies to get a conversation started (pictured right)

They can then choose the gender, location and age of potential dates and browse through other nearby users’ collages.

Like Tinder, where users either like or dislike a person’s appearance to decide whether someone can contact them or not, singletons of Twine Canvas can like someone’s canvas and can contact each other if the feeling is mutual.

However, unlike Tinder Twine Canvas only lets users see photos of one another – and let people start chatting – once they like each other.

The app’s developers claim the system lets people make ‘real connections’ instead of being seduced by looks alone.

It also has an ‘ice breaker’ function to suggest questions to ask one another based upon mutual interests, such as ‘who is your favourite fashion designer?’ and ‘what’s the weather like in Palo Alto?’
