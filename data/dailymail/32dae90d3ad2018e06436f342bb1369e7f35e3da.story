Notts County have signed former Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll.

The 36-year-old Northern Ireland international, a free agent after leaving Greek champions Olympiacos, has put pen to paper on a one-year contract with the Sky Bet League One club.

Carroll has been training with Shaun Derry's men and featured for the Magpies in their pre-season friendly matches against FC Halifax Town and Spanish side Osasuna.

After losing Bartosz Bialkowski to Ipswich last month, Carroll will be Notts' number one this season and will start against Preston at Deepdale when the 2014/15 campaign begins on Saturday.

The veteran goalkeeper will be hoping to make his league debut when Notts County travel to Preston at the weekend.

Carroll, capped 35 times by Northern Ireland, has made over 400 professional appearances throughout his career, which has also included stints with Hull, Wigan, Derby, Rangers and West Ham.
