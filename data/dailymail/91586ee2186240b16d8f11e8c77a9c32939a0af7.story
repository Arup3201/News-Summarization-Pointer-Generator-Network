The suburban Detroit homeowner who shot dead an unarmed 19-year-old black woman who knocked on his door last fall said he is haunted by his actions as he took the stand today in his second-degree murder trial.

Theodore Wafer, 55, told the jury Monday that he feared multiple people were trying to break into his house when teen Renisha McBride banged on his door in the early hours of November 2, after she drunkenly got into a car accident.

He added that he didn't know whether his shotgun was loaded when he opened the door and fired at McBride's head.

'It's devastating,' a tearful Wafer told the jury. 'She had her life in front of her. I took that from her.'

Theodore Wafer took the stand on Monday to defend his actions in the November shooting death of 16-year-old Renisha McBride

But Wafer also said that he feared for his life and that he didn't want to be a victim in his own home.

'I wasn't going to cower in my house,' Theodore Wafer said.

Wafer
 is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter and could be 
sentenced to up to life in prison with the chance for parole, if he's 
convicted. He says he shot McBride in self-defense, but prosecutors 
argue that Wafer could have stayed safely behind his locked doors and 
called 911 instead of confronting McBride, whom he didn't know.

Softly and methodically, Wafer told the Wayne County Circuit Court jury how he followed loud bangs from his front door to his side door and back to the front again before fetching his 12-gauge shotgun.

He said he opened the front door slightly and saw that the outer, screen door was damaged. He then opened the inner door further and 'this person came out from the side of my house so fast. I raised the gun and shot,' he told jurors after taking the stand on the seventh day of testimony.

Wafer also said he thought there could have been more than one person outside of his 1,100-square-foot home near Detroit's far west side. He said he pulled the trigger 'to defend myself. It was them or me.'

When police arrived, McBride lay in a pool of blood just off the porch.

Self defense? Wafer told the jury that when he opened his screen door, he saw that it had been torn and thought someone was trying to break in. That's when he pulled the trigger no McBride. Wafer's home pictured above.

In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, civil rights activists questioned whether race may have been a factor. Wafer is white and McBride was black, and some likened the killing to that of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. But race faded as an issue and wasn't mentioned as a factor by prosecutors or defense attorneys during court hearings that preceded the trial.

Earlier in the trial, prosecutors played a recording of Wafer telling an officer that he didn't know the gun was loaded. They contend that Wafer didn't need to use deadly force against McBrideAn autopsy found McBride's blood-alcohol level was about 0.22, which is nearly three times Michigan's legal limit for driving. About 3Â½ hours before Wafer killed her, McBride crashed her car into a parked vehicle on a Detroit street about half a mile away.

To acquit Wafer, the jury would have to find that he shot McBride because he had a reasonable and honest fear for his life.

Occasionally rubbing the right side of his head and speaking with his eyes closed, Wafer testified that he bought the shotgun about six years ago.

Wafer's lawyer, Cheryl Carpenter, asked if he had a security system installed at his home. He said no.

'I think everybody would like to have a security system in their house,' he said. 'I couldn't afford it.'

The neighborhood had changed greatly since he bought the house in 1994, added Wafer, who appeared Monday to be fixated on his personal safety.

'My front door and screen door are usually always locked,' said Wafer, adding that the same goes for his back door. He said he uses the side door most often to get in and out and that the screen door on the side of his house is usually not locked.

Earlier Monday, a firearms expert testified for the defense that Wafer and McBride were both apparently standing close to his screen door when he shot her through it, killing her.

Retired state Trooper David Balash said the hole in the door made by the shotgun blast shows it was near the door when he fired it. He said the buckshot wounds on McBride's body show she was standing near the door when Wafer shot her last fall.

'My opinion is she was very close to the door ... within a foot,' Balash told the jury.

It is not clear how or why she showed up on Wafer's porch. They didn't know each other.

Dr. Werner Spitz, a former medical examiner, testified last week that a laceration on McBride's hand shows she may have injured it while pounding on Wafer's door. But the doctor who performed the autopsy found nothing remarkable about her hand.
