A university cheerleading club is hoping to boost sales of its naked charity calendar - by offering customers a chance to date one of the cover stars.

Around two dozen of the undergraduates from the University of Nottingham stripped off to pose for the shots - using only pom-poms to cover their modesty.

But not content with simply posing for racy snaps to raise money for charity, the selfless cheerleaders decided to give people who buy their calendar a chance to meet the girls in the flesh - and even go on a date.

Baring all: Cheerleaders from the University of Nottingham stripped off to pose for a naked calendar and are even offering one lucky man a date with a squad member

The University of Nottingham Cheerleading Squad - aka The Nottingham Knights - revealed the offer when they launched their 2014 calendar today.

For 50p on top of the £5 asking price fans can put their name into a raffle for the chance to join the girls on a night out.

On the cover, four daring girls - wearing only black high heels - smile for the camera as they hide their modesty with a just a pair of gold pom-poms.

And inside, 25 members of the 55-strong squad can be seen in a further series of cheeky poses wearing skimpy lingerie in most, and completely naked in others.

The team has already had dozens of pre-orders for their first print run of 150 copies as eager male students vie for the chance to bag a night on the town with the girls.

Club spokesperson Amy Penn, 21, came up with the incentive as a way to bring a new twist to the annual tradition.

Speaking to the Tab student newspaper, she said: 'I thought it was a good way to generate some interest and offer something more than the usual calendar stuff.

'For 50p you could win a date with a cheerleader which I think will spur some people to dig into their pockets.

'It's something a bit different to just having a calendar, you don't normally get a chance to meet the people in them - or win a date.

'It wasn't strange taking our clothes off for the photos - we have to put a lot of trust in each other when we do routines so we're quite comfortable around our teammates.

'It was a really fun atmosphere on the shoot, we just got on and had fun with it.

'The reaction has been really positive, you get the odd comment from boys but you don't really listen to them.

'Some people say charity calendars are tacky but I think the shots are really tasteful and no-one was forced to do it.

'All the girls got to choose which month they wanted to appear in and there are a couple of shots where the girls are in their uniforms if they didn't want to take their clothes off.

'You do get used to lads making rude comments when you're a cheerleader, it's nothing new so you take it on the chin and get on with it.

'At the end of the day it's a bit of fun and it's all for a really good cause.'

The cheerleaders - who perform fundraising activities year-round - have already raised £500 for local charity Forget-Me-Notts since September this year.

Part of Operation Orphan, it provides selection boxes and easter egg packs to children in care.

The calendar can be purchased from the group's Facebook page.
