London has been turned inside out over the past decade because the highly-paid are now choosing the gritty inner-city over once-affluent leafy suburbs.

A map compiled by housing experts shows that the 21st century capital has gone through 'reverse gentrification' at a dramatic pace.

Based on the professions and salaries of those living there, the red areas show places that have gone 'upmarket' and communities that have gone 'downmarket' since 2001.

All change: This map from property experts show how areas of London have gone upmarket, in red, and downmarket, in blue, in the past decade based on the earnings and professions who live there

Experts from estate agency 
Savills  used socio-economic data from the Office for National Statistics and compared who lived where in 2001 and then in 2011, the latest data available.

It reveals the end of the trend where those who could not afford areas like Kensington, Chelsea, Islington and other salubrious areas of Central London headed to the outer edges of the city.

Top managers, high-end professionals and business owners who once settled in north and west London suburbs like Ealing, Walthamstow and Wood Green are now flocking to up-and-coming areas of east London, including Stratford, the Isle of Dogs and Hackney.

Areas once notorious for slums and 
vast estates have become richer and more fashionable, especially around the 
Olympic Park.

A ring of blue across much of the northern suburbs from east to west shows how communities there are in decline.

.... but they are turning away from areas like leafy Ealing, west London

Reverse gentrification: Areas like this one in Hackney, east London, are being chosen with greater regularity over communities further out of London

Savills researcher
Neal Hudson, who put together the data, said building new homes along the Thames and on the eastern fringes of the city had been snapped up by the more wealthy.

These young professionals would have generally headed further outwards for their homes, but now want 'urban living', he said.

'The affordability pressures of the London housing market have priced many people out of central London,' Mr Hudson said.

'As prices increased more people moved outwards in search of more affordable accommodation.

'During the 2001-11 period we have seen greater concentrations of lower earning households in suburban London where the housing stock is typically more affordable and can be made cheaper being split into flats or occupied by multiple adults sharing the rent'.

The ONS plot NS-Sec for all over Britain, which is based on what people living there do for a living, and ranked between one and eight.

One is higher management, four is an average office job and eight is someone who has never worked or is long-term unemployed.

These low-paid or unemployed people have been forced out of central London at an astonishing rate in the past decade as house prices and rents rocketed.
