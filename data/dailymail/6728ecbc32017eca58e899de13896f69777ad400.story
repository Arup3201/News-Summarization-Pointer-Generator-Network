At 5ft 2" tall and tipping the scales at just under 6st, Laura Davison, now 30, from Weston-super-Mare, thought she would never become a mother.

Diagnosed with anorexia in her teens, she endured two stints in therapy before meeting her partner, Del, in 2004.

Much to her surprise, she soon became pregnant but despite her happiness, her anorexia never completely went away, with Laura surviving on just two pieces of toast a day during her third and most recent pregnancy.

Now mother to Daniel, eight, Michael, seven and baby Katie, Laura says she hopes the birth of her youngest child will help her turn the corner and become the mother she's always wanted to be.

'I was first diagnosed with anorexia when I was about 16 but had issues long before that,' explains Laura, who appears on tonight's episode of One Born Every Minute.

'Although I was never fat, I used to eat a lot and I do remember a girl at school saying to me if you carry on eating like that, you're going to get fat.

'So I cut out chocolate and crisps and lost a little bit of weight and it spiralled from there.

'At my worst, I was eating one rich tea biscuit a day.'

Although dangerously ill, Laura managed to pass her GCSEs and combined school work with a demanding weekend job, which she says was 'like exercise'.

At 18, she was hospitalised and spent time at The Priory in Bristol before being transferred to the Birmingham branch.

Doctors, horrified by her inability to fight off the disease, warned her that she risked being unable to have children. But even that wasn't enough to stop Laura.

'It upset me, the thought of it,' she remembers. 'I wasn't getting periods because I was so underweight but at the time, I was so in the grip of the eating disorder, I didn't care.'

As with any illness, anorexia can result in problems during pregnancy.

'The are a number of potential effects of
 anorexia,' explains Jane Munro of the Royal College of Midwives.

'Among them are a low birth weight baby, miscarriage and 
stillbirth, premature birth and an increased chance of having a 
caesarean section.

'The mother is also more likely to develop  postnatal depression if she suffers from anorexia.

'A healthy  diet is vital  for both the baby and mother throughout pregnancy and after the birth.'

But Laura's life was about to change dramatically - and for the better - when she met and fell in love with her partner Del.

Much
 to the couple's delight, within months of striking up a relationship 
and against all the odds, the 20-year-old found herself pregnant.

'We were only together for five months 
before I fell pregnant,' says Laura. 'We thought there was no point using 
contraceptives because we thought I wouldn't be able to have children.'

And with her maternal instincts kicking in, Laura found herself eating properly for the first time in years.

'I would eat chips for breakfast,' she chuckles. 'Potatoes were my craving. My eating disorder was never about hurting 
anyone else, just myself, and my maternal instincts took over.'

But six months after Daniel was born by emergency caesarian, the anorexia returned. By now pregnant with her second child, the stress of juggling the demands of a tiny baby and a pregnancy left Laura struggling.

'From the outside, I looked like a happy 
mum,' she reveals. 'But because of the caesarian, I found it harder to bond with Daniel and although I did fall in love with him when he was about three months old, the stress of being pregnant again so soon led to it coming back.

'It wasn't all the time but it was there. The clothes I was wearing
 were maternity but a size 10. I think I was OK. I was small but not too bad.'

By the end of her pregnancy, Laura, who says she spent most of the nine months on a diet of a breakfast of bran flakes with milk and a dinner of spaghetti Bolognese, weighed just 9st 5lbs.

Although at 7.5lbs baby Michael was smaller than her older son, he was healthy and Laura was besotted.

But once again, her anorexia returned - this time triggered by the stress of juggling two small sons with an increasingly busy job.

'I was working in a solicitors office in Bristol and I can remember throwing up in the office toilet,' she remembers.

'We were dealing with home repossessions which went up from 20 to 100 in a week after the recession began.

'I felt like I wasn't giving 100 per cent at home or work - compounded by feeling awful for leaving the boys and for not being able to do my job as well as I wanted.'

Weighing just 6st 6lbs, Laura's problems were made worse by a litany of health problems that included foot surgery and having a lump removed from her breast.

'I started with two slices of toast, the one flapjack at lunch and I would try and eat evening meal,' says Laura.

'I started throwing that up and then the same with flapjack at work. Once I was signed off work, I would vomit up to 20 times a day.

'The children were never around when I did it and I would eat meals with everyone but Del would do most of the parenting.'

The pressure proved too much for the couple to handle and they split up for two years before getting back together again in 2012.

But anorexia was still casting its shadow over Laura's life and when she became pregnant for a third time, dealing with it became more difficult than ever.

This time, the trigger was a court case 
following an assault by a former boyfriend. Unable to cope with the 
stress, Laura was living on a single slice of toast and peanut butter a 
day.

'I did have a lot of support from the midwife,' says Laura, 'but I was under
 a lot of stress and pressure and I felt bad that I wasn't able to eat normally
 for her.

'Later she found me a dietician and I increased what I was eating to two
 slices of toast and peanut butter and one apple a day.'

By the end of her pregnancy, Laura weighed just 8st 3lb, much of it baby, and was warned that she faced a riskier than normal birth as a result.

Luckily, daughter Katie was born healthy, although at 6lb 12oz, she weighed considerably less than her older brothers had.

Although Laura says she is still struggling with her eating and is currently back on her pregnancy routine of two slices of toast and peanut butter a day, she is positive that she'll find a way to beat the disease.

'I'm maintaining my weight,' she says. 'I feel positive that I'm keeping my weight on and I'm
 not getting worse. If I start the day good and I end the day good, 
that's enough.

'The healthier I am, the more I can do with the children,' she adds. 'They are my motivation. If I didn't have them, I might not still be here.
