Manchester United keeper Sam Johnstone has joined Doncaster Rovers on loan until January 3.

The England Under 21 international's last appearance was in the summer tour fixture against Roma although he has been involved in behind-closed-doors friendlies of late.

Johnstone, 21, enjoyed a loan with the South Yorkshire club last term after loan spells with Scunthorpe United, Walsall and Yeovil Town.
