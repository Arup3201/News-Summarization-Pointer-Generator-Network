A group of gypsies have taken over a school car park by setting up camp while staff and pupils were away over half term.

Parents at Cheslyn Hay Sport and Community High School in Staffordshire were warned the unexpected guests could be there for some time, as staff try to resolve the issue with local authorities.

In a statement issued to parents, the school said it had worked with police and Staffordshire County Council to clear the site before the start of the school week but had been unsuccessful.

Unexpected guests: Travelers who have set up camp on a car park belonging to the Cheslyn Hay Sport and Community High School in Staffordshire

Traffic chaos: Congestion built up around the school from 8am as parents struggled to find somewhere to park

They said: 'Currently, there is a group of travellers camped on the school coach park, who arrived sometime during Wednesday night.

'Despite the school being closed for half term, the site staff alerted the school's Business Director and Headteacher.

'During Thursday, both the county council and the police were informed of the issue.

'The school has done everything in its power to resolve the situation but it is the county council who own the land and it is their responsibility to take further action.

Unmoved: Staff at the school believe the caravans may not be moved for some time, despite efforts by the local council and police

In the way: The school day finished earlier at 3pm to avoid pupils clashing with the travellers

'Unfortunately, following calls to the council and the police it is now seems that the issue with the coach park will not be resolved in the immediate future.'

The school brought the end of lessons forward to 3pm to avoid clashes with pupils leaving neighbouring Cheslyn Hay Primary School.

Teachers from both the schools were posted outside to supervise pick-ups and drop-offs.

They added: 'Staff from both schools will be on duty at the front of school. These procedures will be in place until further notice.

'Both schools continue to work closely with the police and council to resolve the situation and to reduce the impact on the local community.'

Alternative means: Officials were forced to shut the school car park and sent school coaches to the neighbouring leisure centre car park instead

Staffordshire County Council said it would take court action if the travellers did not move on of their own accord.

Mike Lawrence, Cabinet Member for Communities, Culture and Localism and local member for the area, said: 'The travellers have been asked to move from the two sites they are currently occupying at the car park of Cheslyn Hay School and on land at nearby Middle Hill.

'We do understand the concerns of residents particularly around parking at the school and would like to reassure parents that we are doing everything within our powers to resolve this issue swiftly.

'We are working with the police and in the meantime we are applying to the courts for a possession order to remove the travellers from the school car park and the nearby land, which is used as a bridleway, but hope they will leave the site without any further intervention from the courts or the police.'
