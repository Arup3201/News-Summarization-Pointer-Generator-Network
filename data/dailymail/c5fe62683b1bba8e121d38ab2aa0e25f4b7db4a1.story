A British travel agent who specialises in unusual holidays is refusing to let brutal Islamic State militants force him to scrap his £750-a-time trips to Iraq.

Travel mad Dylan Harris set up a firm offering daredevil tourists vacations to a string of bizarre destinations including the troubled Middle East country.

Harris, 35, said: 'ISIS have not reached the area of Iraq where we go to and hopefully the US Air strikes will hold them back.

'We are checking the situation is a daily basis but for the moment it is business as usual.'

Fancy this? Dylan Harris' firm Lupine Travel will continue to offer trips to Iraq despite the ongoing militant action

Clear message: The Foreign & Commonwealth Office's advice for travel to Iraq. Many of the areas on the tour (numbered) are pictured here in yellow, at the north end of the country. Erbil (2) is in the danger zone

Tour stops: 1 - Diyarbakir, 2 - Erbil, 3 - Rawanduz, 4 - Sulaymaniyah, 5- - Halabja, 6 - Duhok

Dylan is the owner of Lupine Travel and has offices in Manchester and China. The company are keen to stress that the tours take place in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.

For approximately £750 you will get:

Keen back packer Dylan said: 'I spent most of my 20s travelling but found myself constantly looking for new experiences.

'I found the most rewarding travel experiences were to places with very few, if any, tourists.

'While visiting these places I met several others taking similar trips and the consensus was always the same - the logistics of visiting these countries were very difficult and costs usually high.

Burnout: The unpredictability of the IS militants make a trip to Iraq at one's own risk

Careful: Kurdish troops forces position themselves on a road to monitor security and movements around Kirkuk, less than two hours away from one of Lupine's stop-offs at Sulaymaniyah

'So I decided to try and build up a network of contacts in these places to make trips there easier and put my own packages together, for affordable prices.

'Personally I like Iran because it is so different from what you would actually expect.

'The people are some of the most friendly and well-educated around and the food is great - it is just a place that continues to surprise.'

Tensions are high in Iraq as Islamic State fighters continue to bomb and attack many towns in the north of the country.

The battles between Sunnis and Shiites are escalating, with bomb blasts killing over 30 people in Kirkuk and Baghdad on Friday.

The innocent killing of U.S. journalist James Foley by the Islamic State militants in Syria has led for calls on the Barack Obama government for sterner action on the terrorists, in both Iraq and Syria.

The foreign & Commonwealth Office have advised against all-but essential travel to the Kurdistan region of Iraq.

Speaking to Mail Online, Harris said: 'Our next tour there is in October. At the moment we still plan to go ahead with the trip as the areas we are visiting are currently safe.

'If the situation deteriorates though we will re-evaluate and cancel the trip if we feel that it is too dangerous to visit.

'Clients are required to take out their own personal insurance. In the past, most worldwide insurance coverage included travelling to the Kurdish region of Iraq but due to the recent change in FCO advise, we are asking clients to check with their providers for any change in coverage and to take out specialist insurance if need be.'

Day four

After breakfast we travel out onto the famous Hamilton Road.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest engineering feats of the 
20th Century, the road was engineered by Kiwi, Archibald Hamilton 
between 1928 and 1932.

The road snakes through incredible scenery, from gorges, canyons, 
rivers, lakes and mountains. We will stop along the way at Bekhal 
Waterfall, Gali Ali Bag Waterfall and also pass through the towns and 
villages of Shaqlawa, Harir and Soran.

En-route we will visit the Qshla of Koya Citadel. Upon arrival in 
Sulaymaniyah we take a sombre visit to Amna Sukhara, also known as the 
'Red Prison'. This was the former Northern headquarters of Mukhbarat 
(the Iraqi Intelligence Service) and was used by Saddam Hussein's regime
 for imprisonment and torture of Kurds.

Within the prison is a beautiful memorial made from 182,000 
mirrored pieces and 5400 lights. Each piece of mirror signifies each 
Kurd killed by Saddam's regime and the lights for each Kurdish village 
destroyed.

After lunch we will check into our hotel before heading to Chavy
