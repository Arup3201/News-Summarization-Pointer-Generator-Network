Ed Miliband said he would create a Secretary of State for Women if he wins the next election

Labour would have a Secretary of State for Women if it won the next election, Ed Miliband said yesterday.

Mr Miliband also pledged his party’s Cabinet would be 50 per cent female.

It follows Culture Secretary Maria Miller’s resignation over expenses, leaving just three women in a Cabinet of 22. But Tory MP Tracey Crouch called the plan ‘patronising’.

Hours after Mrs Miller stood down, David Cameron was plunged into a row for handing her role as women’s minister to Nicky Morgan – who will not be made a full Cabinet member, despite also taking on the powerful position of Financial Secretary.

Downing Street had already raised eyebrows by suggesting new Culture Secretary Sajid Javid would retain responsibility for women’s issues. The suggestion was later withdrawn.

Labour said the ‘demotion’ of the role was further evidence of David Cameron’s ‘women problem’.

Mr Miliband said: ‘If there’s a Labour government, the post of women and equalities minister will be Cabinet rank.’ 

This could be a Secretary of State for Women, he said.

The Prime Minister pledged in 2010 that his cabinet would conain a third women by the end of the parliament.

Conservative MP Tracey Crouch, left, has called the Labour leader's plan 'patronising'. Since Maria Miller, right, resigned there are only three women in the Cabinet 

Labour has for several years used controversial all-women shortlists to increase numbers of female MPs, who now make up over 40pc of the shadow cabinet.

Mr Miliband said if he won office, his target would be a cabinet of 50pc women.

He said 30 years ago only 3pc of MPs were women. ‘To believe that was the best person for the job you woud have to believe that men were 30 times better at being MPs than women’, he said.
