European migrants should not move to Britain unless they have a job lined up, George Osborne suggested.

The Chancellor insisted that European Union freedom of movement rules were not created to allow people to live off the welfare state in other countries.

But in an escalation of tensions between London and Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel today made clear that the general principle of freedom of movement in the EU is 'not negotiable'.

David Cameron is under increasing pressure to tackle EU immigration, which has fuelled a rise in the number of people moving to Britain. 

A number of ideas floated by senior Tories in recent weeks have been dismissed as illegal or unworkable.

Downing Street today admitted that the Prime Minister still does not know how to curb immigration, telling journalists: 'No final decisions have been taken.'

Instead of imposing quotas or caps on the number of people who could move to Britain, the PM is being urged to focus on limiting access to the benefits system for the unemployed.

However, Number 10 insiders insist he is determined to tackle the 'huge numbers of people' who move to the UK for work.

One proposal would see European migrants banned from the UK unless they have guaranteed work – and would get kicked out after three months if they could not support themselves.

Mr Osborne insisted that Germany understands 'the disquiet that is caused amongst British people'.

He told BBC Breakfast: 'You have people coming from other parts of Europe here to claim our benefits, who don't necessarily have jobs to go to. 

'This is creating a huge pressure on public services and the British public want this addressed.'

He added: 'We're going to do this in a calm and rational way, but the British people want this addressed; we're employed by the British people and that's what we're going to do.

'What we're going to address is this question of how freedom of movement operates in the 21st century.

'It was never envisaged that you would have such large numbers of people coming, people coming who don't have job offers, people who move onto our benefit system – although we've been able to tighten that up in recent months, but it's still the case that they can do that.

'And that causes a lot of public unhappiness because they think it's unfair. Of course, these are welfare payments paid for by hard-working British taxpayers.'

David Cameron is being forced to change his planned reform of immigration rules to win Angela Merkel's support

What Berlin says about freedom of movement

German government source: 'Mrs Merkel feels she has done all she can to placate the UK, but will not accept immigration curbs from EU member states under any circumstances. It has come to a Mexican stand-off and it is now a question of who blinks first.' 

Angela Merkel's spokesman: 'The general principle of freedom of movement in the European Union is not negotiable.'

What London says 

Chancellor George Osborne: 'You have people coming from other parts of Europe here to claim our benefits, who don't necessarily have jobs to go to. This is creating a huge pressure on public services and the British public want this addressed.'

Downing Street source: 'We are talking about numbers. Overall numbers are too high.'

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith: 'All I know is that the work that we have done is to get rid of the pull factor; the Prime Minister’s always made clear that there are limits in all of this, but I wouldn’t get engaged in a debate about principles. I always think to myself when people start debating principles, what actually happens is they lose the reality of what is happening on the ground.'

A Downing Street source insisted in addition to tackling abuse of the benefits system, Mr Cameron had made clear he wants to limit the overall number of migrants to Britain.

'We are talking about numbers. Overall numbers are too high. We have significantly cut migration from outside the EU,' the source told MailOnline.

'We are now in a position where the UK economy is performing much more strongly... and huge numbers of people are coming here from those European countries to work in the UK and that is now an issue.' 

However German Chancellor Angela Merkel has fired a warning shot at the Prime Minister, suggesting she would rather see Britain leave the EU than allow the Prime Minister to tear up its rules on free movement of labour.

The Chancellor warned the Prime Minister that he is reaching a 'point of no return' by pushing for reform of the bloc's sacred free movement system.

The pair clashed at a summit in Brussels last month, German magazine Der Spiegel said. Citing senior officials, it said Mrs Merkel told Mr Cameron he was nearing a 'point of no return' with plans to introduce quotas for the number of EU workers who can come to Britain. She threatened to abandon her efforts to keep Britain in the EU unless he backed down. 

One government insider was quoted on Radio Bavaria saying: 'The time for talking is close to over.

'Mrs Merkel feels she has done all she can to placate the UK, but will not accept immigration curbs from EU member states under any circumstances. It has come to a Mexican stand-off and it is now a question of who blinks first.'

Today Mrs Merkel's official spokesman, Steffen Seibert, insisted that Germany wants Britain to remain an 'active and engaged' member.

But he stressed that Mrs Merkel has also made it very clear that 'the general principle of freedom of movement in the European Union is not negotiable'.

National Insurance numbers (NINOs) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the EU, up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed

George Osborne is to seek a deal on cutting Britain's shock £1.7billion EU bill at a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels this week.

The Chancellor will lobby other member states to look again at the rules which hammered the UK, while giving rebates to the likes of France and Germany.

Downing Street said the government was still examining the detail of the rules used by EU officials to calculate the astonishing demand, linked to better than expected economy growth.

David Cameron's official spokesman said: 'What's clear is that there are a number of issues at play here. 

'There is still more work to do to understand the forecasts, how these compare to other countries.' 

Any new deal on EU migration will have to be agreed by 28 member states.

Mr Cameron's officials spokesman said: 'The point we are making is when the founding fathers established the European Union and introduced the principle of free movement it was about labour and how  countries integrated in the single market.

'The mass migration that we have seen with new countries joining, the impact on other populations in countries like the UK, free movement in order to claim benefits, these are all ways that have developed and evolved.'

Senior Tories want the government to limit access to tax credits for new arrivals to the UK.

Syed Kamall, the leader of the Conservatives in the European parliament, said claiming benefits should be linked to contributions to the welfare system.

He told The Times: 'One of the problems we face is that we have a universal benefits system, whereas other countries have the contributory benefit system.'

He suggested that all benefits, including tax credits, would only be available to someone who had paid tax. It would cover everyone, so it does not discriminate against EU migrants.

Mr Kamall added: 'Anyone who wants to get benefits would have to pay in for two years.

'I'd like us to say if we win the next election that benefits from the end of 2017 have to be contributory. That gives people now in the system time to contribute.'

It is the latest idea to emerge in the Tory search for a policy which will satisfy demands for tougher controls, woo Ukip voters and be agreed by all 28 EU member states.

An earlier proposal to impose quotas on access to National Insurance numbers, needed to work in the UK, was dismissed as 'illegal' by outgoing European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.

Another option was to apply an 'emergency brake' to the numbers which could come from a particular country if, for example, their economic collapse led to large numbers flocking to the UK in search for work.

Mr Cameron has promised to put immigration at the heart of his plan to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU, before holding at in-out referendum by 2017.

However, his speech setting out his plans will now be delayed until after the Rochester and Strood by-election, which Ukip is on course to win after the defection of Tory MP Mark Reckless.

In 2011, Mr Cameron promised to bring borders and immigration under control: 'No ifs. No buts.'

He vowed that net migration would be in 'the order of tens of thousands each year', but latest figures put it at over 200,000.
