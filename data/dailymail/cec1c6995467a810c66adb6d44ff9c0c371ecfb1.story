They became best friends as teenage U.S. Navy shipmates during the Vietnam War.

But after the conflict ended, they lost contact and despite many attempts, could not find each other.

Now, a staggering 40 years on, veterans Rick Mueller and Joe Martinez have been reunited.

Shipmates: Mr Martinez and Mr Mueller became best friends as Navy shipmates during the Vietnam War. They shared a cabin, traveled to various countries and worked side by side on the U.S.S. White Plains AFS-4

The pair, who were aged just 17 and 18 when they first met in 1971, were filmed greeting each other for the first time on Mr Mueller's wife Marla's cellphone.

Mr Mueller, 61, and Mr Martinez met on the Navy's U.S.S. White Plains AFS-4 supply ship and quickly became friends. They were so close they were nicknamed 'M&M'.

During their service, the pair shared a cabin, traveled to a number of countries - including Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok and Japan - and worked side by side on the ship.

Together again: After the war ended in 1975, the friends spent 40 years trying to find each other, including searching phone books and sending letters. Above, they look through old photos following their reunion

Letter: It was only when Mr Martinez's sister-in-law, Jennifer Williamson, found Mr Mueller's details online and Mr Martinez subsequently sent his former shipmate a letter (pictured) that the two were reunited

After the war ended in 1975, they returned home to their old lives, but were determined to stay in touch, Fox 29 News reported. 

However, when Mr Mueller reached out to Mr Martinez from a pay phone at a Denver gas station, he realised he had the wrong person.

For the next four decades, the war veterans tried desperately to find each other, including searching phone books and sending letters to various addresses, but neither of them had any success.

We tried 'every day for the last 40-some years,' Mr Mueller, who even named his first child 'Joe' after his old friend, told AOL.com.

Best friends: During their time in the U.S. Navy, the duo were nicknamed 'M&M' based on their surnames

It was only when Mr Martinez's sister-in-law, Jennifer Williamson, heard about her relative's quest and scoured the internet for Mr Mueller's details that the two were reunited.

After she informed Mr Martinez of her success, the shocked veteran sent Mr Mueller a letter telling him it was his 'best friend' and former shipmate, and asking him to give him a call.

A few days later, a call came in from Minnesota. 'I heard his voice, "Is this Joe Martinez?" Then I screamed, "Rick!" I knew so quick (it was Rick),' said Mr Martinez. 

The pair then talked for more than two hours, a lot of which was spent crying in sheer joy at having found each other. 'You could just feel the love over the airwaves,' said Mr Mueller.

They then arranged to meet at Mr Martinez's house in Northglenn, Colorado - both slightly grayer and less fit, but still sharing a special bond - before engaging in the reunion earlier this month.

Speaking on the day of the reunion, Mr Martinez said: 'I haven't been this happy since I remember when.' Mr Mueller added: 'I'm going to cry about this day for the rest of my life.'

The pair have now vowed to stay in touch. And Mr Martinez and his family are even planning a holiday to Mr Mueller and his wife Marla's home in Le Sueur, Minnesota, next year.
