Winning a referendum to stay in the European Union will be ‘very difficult’, Tony Blair has claimed.

The former Labour prime minister said holding an in-out referendum in 2017 would be a ‘disaster’ for Britain.

Speaking to French TV, Mr Blair said it would be a challenge to convince voters that remaining part of the EU was in British interests.

David Cameron has vowed to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU before holding an in–out referendum in 2017.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has refused to back a referendum – insisting Labour would only call a vote if there was a transfer of powers to Brussels.

Mr Blair was asked by French TV reporters about Mr Cameron's battle with Brussels over the demand that Britain pays an extra £1.7billion by December 1.

The former Labour leader said: ‘There have always been, including during my terms, disputes on Europe.

‘But what's different today is that if the Conservative Party is re–elected next year, there will be a referendum on whether to leave the European Union.

‘I think it would be a disaster for my country and I think that the people of Britain will vote to remain in the European Union in the end. But I think that it will be very difficult.’

Mr Blair said many people in the EU had mixed feelings about Europe.

He said: ‘But the difference is that [they believe] one must reform Europe from within, not by threatening to leave.

‘That's the difference.’ Mr Blair said he believes that Mr Cameron wants to remain in the EU but that he ‘can't be certain’.

Mr Cameron has insisted he wants Britain to remain in a reformed EU.

However, he is facing pressure from Tory backbenchers to say that he will campaign to leave the EU if he is unable to secure major reforms to immigration rules within the bloc.

Mr Blair said: ‘I can't be certain but I think that he wants to remain in Europe.

‘But it is very difficult for him in his party, because the Conservative Party, many people within the party are Europhobic.

‘I think that when one is prime minister of a country like Great Britain one knows full well that it is intelligent to remain inside the biggest political union in the world and the biggest commercial market in the world.’

Mr Blair said Britain could only continue to compete with countries like China and the United States if it remained part of the EU.
