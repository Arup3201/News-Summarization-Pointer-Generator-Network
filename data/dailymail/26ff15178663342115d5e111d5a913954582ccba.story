Boris Johnson said he is 'appalled' and is 'on the case' after American singer Kelis said she was subject to alleged racial abuse at a London airport.

The London Mayor tweeted the 32-year-old after she launched into an angry Twitter tirade against Britain following the alleged incident at passport control at one 
of the capital's airports.

He wrote: 'Heard about the treatment you received at a UK airport. Want 
you to know this is not typical. I’m appalled & I’m on the case.'

On the case: London Mayor Boris Johnson said he is 'appalled' at the treatment American singer Kelis, right, allegedly received at a London airport this week

The Mayor has now written to Rob Whiteman, 
chief executive of the UK Border Agency, urging him to remind staff they 
are 'the face and voice of modern Britain.'

Kelis took to Twitter claiming she was labelled a 'slave' by a
middle-aged white man as she was travelling home to America 
with her two-year-old son Knight after performing at Bestival on the 
Isle Of Wight over the weekend.

Dear Rob

I was alarmed to read press reports about the singer Kelis’s bad 
experience at passport control at a London airport. Her main claim was 
about a member of the public but she also alleges that uniformed staff 
laughed and left her feeling humiliated.

Can I take this opportunity to encourage you to remind all UKBA staff 
that they are the face and voice of modern Britain - the first people we
encounter when we come home, the first people visitors encounter when 
they come to our shores.

It is critical for the success of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games 
next summer that visitors from all over the globe have a great 
experience from beginning to end of their stay and that we showcase the 
UK at its best. The Olympics is a one-off opportunity to reinforce 
London’s reputation for another generation as the best big city in the 
world. It would be wonderful if the people who man our borders are tuned
into this opportunity.

Yours ever,

Boris Johnson

The incident took place when Kelis was accused of queue-jumping by a 'red-faced sweaty man (I use the word man loosely here)'.

She went on to say he then called her 'slave' and declared she was 'probably a disgusting Nigerian'.

The R&B singer explained: 'He called me kunta kinte and ranted and raved some more.

'The man behind the passport desk laughed, shook his head in agreement I guess, and said "kunta kinte".

Mr Johnson wrote in his letter to Mr Whiteman that he was 'alarmed' by the reports of her experience.

He said: 'Can I take this opportunity to encourage you to remind all UKBA staff 
that they are the face and voice of modern Britain - the first people we
encounter when we come home, the first people visitors encounter when 
they come to our shores.

'It is critical for the success of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games 
next summer that visitors from all over the globe have a great 
experience from beginning to end of their stay and that we showcase the 
UK at its best.

'The Olympics is a one-off opportunity to reinforce 
London’s reputation for another generation as the best big city in the 
world. It would be wonderful if the people who man our borders are tuned
into this opportunity.'

Kelis tweeted she was furious about the incident and said dozens of bystanders said nothing.

Tricky issue: Kelis took to her Twitter page on Monday after she was allegedly subjected to racist abuse at a London airport

She wrote: 'All the while the entire line full 
of people I just sat on a plane with for almost 3hours, over 50 people 
said nothing. I mean literally nothing. Didn't flinch.

'We
all no (sic) I'm no saint, so I retaliated. Not the way I wanted to or 
how that pig deserved. But #1 my gorgeous baby boy was literally sitting
on my hip and #2 I'm a believer. And we are better. Supposed to be.'

Kelis
then brought up the London riots in August - which were committed by 
British people from a range of races, classes and ages.

Behind: Kelis bought up the London riots and said the incident had made her believe the UK was 'decades behind progression'

Hitting out: The R&B singer accused the UK of being 'decades behind in progression'

Obviously upset, the Milkshake singer declared the incident had made her believe the UK was 'decades behind progression'.

She continued: 'I didn't say anything
at the time of the riots in London for a lot of reasons. But I am in 
London all the time and today I'm gonna say that the racial issues in 
the UK are disgusting.

'Its
racially decades behind progression because everything is swept under 
the rug. People don't talk about it. People don't fight about it. Not mentioning a problem doesn't make it go away.'

Rude awakening: Kelis was queuing at passport control when the alleged incident took place

After
many fans pointed out America's on-going racial tensions - which were 
most recently highlighted during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, 
Kelis acknowledged her home country also had issues.

She
added: 'I bring it up now because as an American it is abundantly clear
that my country has a Smorgasbord of disgusting racial problems.

'We are the poster child for racial 
inequality even still with a black president. But its NO SECRET! And 
that I can fight against. I can try to prepare and teach my son. Because
its out there. But you can't fight for or against something no one is 
willing to talk about or even admit exist.'

Anti-racism
groups were keen to point out that while racism still exists in some 
pockets of society, the man's alleged behaviour was not representational
of British people.

A spokesman for the Runnymede Trust, the U.K.’s leading independent race equality group, told WENN.com: 'It’s worth noting that we’re not a 
multi-racial paradise in the U.K. but there is a fight back here, and 
there are lots of ways in which musicians like Kelis can contribute to 
that. Things like the UpRise music festival in London – 10,000 people 
making it clear they are against racism.

'But I don’t think we have got a huge amount to learn from America in 
terms of the racism that operates over there. We are struggling against 
racism in the same way as people are in the States.'
