Fabian Delph can be an instrumental figure in England winning Euro 2016, according to Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood.

Roy Hodgson called Delph into his squad for the coming matches against Lithuania and Italy, to little surprise for Sherwood having tried to sign the 25-year-old at Tottenham.

‘Roy will stumble across a team that will win the Euros. He will, I tell you. They will win it,’ said Sherwood. ‘I feel we’ve got top young talent who will have another year’s football. A lot of them would play for any country across Europe.

Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood says the midfielder can be part of Euro 2016 glory with his country

‘I’ve told Fabian he could be on the verge of something. There’s competition there but he could be a big part of it. Roy loves him.’

Sherwood recalls a chance meeting with Delph’s representative while he was in charge at Spurs last season and the Villa midfielder was mulling over signing a new contract. Delph penned fresh terms in January.

‘I spoke to his agent in London and told him that if I was still in charge at Tottenham, I’d definitely want him to come. I tried my best. He’d cost too much money now, but he would have been a bargain then.

‘He’s got a change of pace and a hammer of a left foot. I think he’s got the ability to drop his shoulder and go past people. I wouldn’t want him to do that to me.

‘Some players you don’t mind playing against and then there’s others like (Paul) Gascoigne who can put you on your arse – just because he will face you up and want to make you look stupid. Gazza used to do it with tricks but Fabian has got more pace and drive.’

Deph has got more 'pace and drive' than Paul Gascoigne, according to Sherwood
