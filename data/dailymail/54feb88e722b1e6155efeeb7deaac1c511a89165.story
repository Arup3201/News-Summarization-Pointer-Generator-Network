Kate Moss’s new fashion collection looks a million dollars on her famous friends.

But to afford any of it, you may need a celebrity-sized salary.

The 40-year-old supermodel’s 15th range for Topshop, which marks her return to design after a four year break, is targeted at the average High Street shopper.

But within hours of the star-studded launch party, eight of the 40 pieces had already sold out online yesterday… and were being touted on eBay for stratospheric prices.

It's a sell out! A lot of pieces, such as this 
£75 smock dress from Kate Moss' new Topshop collection, have already 
sold out - despite going on sale at 9am

It
 is believed that many of the eBay sellers queued to attend a special 
preview event on Tuesday night, when a limited amount of shoppers were 
allowed into Topshop’s flagship Oxford Street store.

Onlookers said 
they bought bundles, with some walking away with five of the same item. 
It meant they were then ready to sell on eBay when  Topshop.com began to
 sell out.

Indeed some shared their plans on Twitter, with one 
writing: ‘Kate Moss for Topshop range is very average. Only worth buying
 if you want to triple your money by reselling on eBay.’

Reacting
 to the eBay surge, the spokesman added: ‘I could give you a personal 
reaction, but I don’t think  it would be printable. There is no official
 comment.’

It's been the most highly anticipated collaboration of the year and today saw Kate Moss' collection for Topshop finally land.

After a four-year hiatus, the supermodel's hotly anticipated range of 
festival-inspired clothing went on sale at 346 Topshop stores across 41 countries
and dropped online at 9am.

So popular are the
 model's Seventies-style pieces, including fringed 
suede jackets, jump suits and maxi dresses, that a lot of the pieces 
sold out in a matter of minutes - and are already cropping up on eBay 
for over three times as much.

Fashion fans are clearly keen to snap up the range ahead of festival season; a £75 embroidered smock dress is already out of stock in all sizes, as is a £130 cocktail dress, on Topshop.com.

Net-a-porter.com is also selling some of the more pricey garments, and even they've sold out.

A £120 paisley print silk coat is long gone, as is her £75 floral dress and the £80 tuxedo trousers she wore to the store last night.

But do not fear, fashion fans! There are still plenty of silk blouses and graphic print kaftans to go around.

Kate is said to have taken 
inspiration from her own wardrobe, which, despite her status as a 
supermodel, isn't just full of designer labels. She's also a fan of 
scouring the rails of second-hand stores.

Main attraction: Hundreds of shoppers turned up at the flagship store to grab a glimpse of Kate Moss, wearing a tuxedo suit from her range, obviously, as she unveiled her new range of festival-inspired clothes 

Would YOU pay that much for a Mossy design? One blue jacket is already on sale on eBay for £750, over three times the original price of £120

A
weave waistcoat, suede shorts and a deep blue fringed jacket are all in
keeping with the Seventies vibe. The latter is said to be inspired by a
jacket the 40-year-old has worn to three Rolling Stones concerts which 
she refers to as her 'gig 
jacket'.

As well as 
channelling a vintage look, she was also keen to reflect her laid-back 
style. There are baggy pyjama trousers glammed up through the use satin 
material in distinct prints and cool kaftans perfect for hitting the 
beach in over the summer.

For evening wear, there are sexy frilled flapper style dresses and long numbers that flash a hint of thigh. Many of the dresses are also in keeping with the vintage-feel with fringing, sequins and  crepe satin.

Vintage vibe: The collection includes maxi dresses for evening and day wear with many items inspired by Kate's own wardrobe

Festival attire: Print kaftans and blouses are a wardrobe staple for jetsetter Kate, while a girl can't have enough LBDs

Party dresses: The spring/summer collection also includes day wear and tailored pieces - as well as a fun fringed festival dresses

Meanwhile there are also some tailored pieces for smart office wear including tuxes and trouser suits and summery floral printed shirts.

While much of the collection will be sold at affordable prices, one dress is a more pricey £600.

The high price tag is to reflect the handiwork that went into creating the densely hand-beaded dress.

Kate first collaborated with Topshop in 2007 before taking a break to work on other projects.

Last
 night, the range was unveiled at the flagship store, causing Oxford 
Street to practically shut down as fashion fans waited impatiently for a 
first look at the new range.

The crowding was exacerbated by the tube
strike: bewildered commuters braving the reduced service were trying to
pile into an overcrowded Oxford Street station at the same time as the model's fans were gathering.

They must have got up early! Fashion fans raced to net-a-porter to snap up the range, with many pieces already sold out

The supermodel finally appeared at around 6.20, at which point thousands were waiting impatiently, camera phones poised.

Kate sauntered onto the stage erected 
outside the main store entrance, wearing a sparkling black blazer and 
matching trousers, from her own collection, naturally.

The model, although certainly used to huge amounts of attention, appeared almost overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crowd.

Kate joined Radio One DJ Nick Grimshaw on stage - however, the only thing she said once the Radio 1 DJ introduced her was: 'Happy shopping'. Oh well.

She
 disappeared after her brief appearance to go for a private dinner with 
friends and supporters - including Cara Delevingne and Sienna Miller - 
who were browsing the rails inside the store.

Selected friends, family and supporters had been invited
inside for a special VIP preview. Guests included Mary McCartney, sister of designer Stella 
McCartney, Linda Shepherd - Kate Moss' mother - and Sienna Miller. 

Following
 the launch of Kate's latest range for Topshop the online auction site, 
eBay has seen a flurry of new bidders keen to get hold of the model's 
latest offerings that are quickly selling out online and in store. 
However, if bidders want to be in with a chance with getting their hands 
on the collection their budget may need to be more suited to Selfridges than 
Topshop...

for the highly sought after jacket.
