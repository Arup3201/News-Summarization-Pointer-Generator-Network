For those Brits that would work overseas, the preferred countries were the U.S., Canada, Germany, Australia and France.

Meanwhile, the UK was the top destination for people from Portugal, Israel, Barbados, Romania and Jamaica.

Escaping political instability or poverty at home was the driving force for people wanting to migrate, while those in developed countries were more likely to migrate to gain more work experience.

Globally, jobseekers said being recognised for their work was their number one priority, while Brits sought 'good relationships with colleagues' and a 'good work-life balance' as the most important factors.

Nearly three quarters of people who work in engineering and technical jobs would move abroad but those in tightly regulated fields are the least mobile, with  half of people in social care and in health and medicine saying they would consider making a move.

The poll of more than 200,000 people from 189 countries was carried out by management consultancy firm The Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the UK's totaljobs.com and The Network, a global alliance of more than 50 recruitment websites.

Mike Booker of totaljobs.com said: 'This report cements London's reputation as a truly global city.

'Not only does it offer a wealth of job opportunities in a range of industries, but it boasts some of the world's top cultural attractions, so it's no surprise that people across the globe want to come and work here.

'In light of this report, employers must take a more global approach to recruitment. As the workforce is so mobile, companies will have to compete globally to attract the best talent, making sure that they target the right groups and differentiate their recruitment strategy.'

BCG's Rainer Strack said: 'It's a world in which the geographic barriers to employment are coming down, including in the minds of some of the most talented and highly educated workers.

'This is opening up significant opportunities for individuals and for the many countries and multinational companies that are facing talent shortages of one sort or another.'
