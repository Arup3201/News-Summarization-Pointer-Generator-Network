Manchester City have formally announced the £3million signing of Bruno Zuculini from Racing Club in Argentina.

The 21-year-old was part of City's US tour and scored in the opening game against Kansas City Sport.

Spanish sides Valencia, Deportivo La Coruna and Malaga have both made enquiries to take the holding midfielder on loan but are understood to have been told that coach Manuel Pellegrini would prefer for the player to join a Premier League club instead.
