Brendan Rodgers says he has had a 'good chat' with Simon Mignolet and insists his goalkeeper is strong enough to improve.

The Belgian stopper has been subject to criticism in recent weeks after a number of disappointing performances.

But Rodgers said: 'He is fine. I have had a good chat with him. The club paid a lot of money for him, and he has saved us in a number of games.'

'It is never easy coping with criticism. It is part of the sport. He has got to focus on being better in his next training session and his next game and that is what he has done. He is strong enough. You have to embrace it. You have to be able to cope with the spotlight. 

'It is always going to be there. You have to fight even harder and stronger when it comes your way. But He is a good guy and he is working well.'
