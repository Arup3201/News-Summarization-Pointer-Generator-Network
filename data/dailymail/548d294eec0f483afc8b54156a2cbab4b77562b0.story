Adorable just doesn't cut it for one very lucky and spolied little black pug.

Nigella (AKA Jelly) the Pug is taking social media by storm, with her facebook page, set up by her owners, gathering more than 12,000 fans.

A celebrity pug in the making, Nigella has featured on a variety of popular Australian TV shows including Better Homes and Gardens with Dr Harry, and most recently Channel 10's The Project.

'beautiful' and 'cute' her Nigella the Pug's adoring fans make a comment on her facebook page.

Living in Frenchs Forest, in Sydney, the not quite one year old pooch likes to hang out with her pug brother Benson and pug sister Tinkler. She loves her mum and dad, home cooked dinners, fetch and cuddles of course.

And not only does this pug have her own facebook account but is on Instagram, pinterest and wait for it...... her own website.

Nigella the Pug is just one of many Aussies pets pampered to the max and research has now proved we are a little obsessed!

Research by Frontline Plus has shown that Aussie pet obsession has been taken to an all new level and that we're going to great lengths to pamper our beloved pets.

It has found that a furkids’ phenomenon is on the rise, with almost half (48%) of Australians admitting to treating them like their child.

It's been highlighted that Australians’ devotion to their pets is remarkable, to the point where owners are buying their furry friends Christmas gifts, letting them sit at the dinner table and even keeping up their oral hygiene by brushing their teeth.

Should I or shouldn't I? Contemplating dinner? Nigella the Pug is one spoiled pooch. It comes as research shows Aussies are obsessed with their pets, nearly half of pet owners admitting they treat them like a child

The research conducted via an online survey of 1,005 pet owners has found life with a pet is very common and that's reflected by figures that our nation has one of the highest rates of pet ownership in the world - 63 percent to be exact.

There's no doubt pets are intrinsically woven into the social fabric of our lives, and it is more evident than ever that pets share and shape our lives. 

Just like Nigella, more and more pet owners are starting to bring their best mates into the digital world. 

More than one in three (38%) pets feature on social media, and 395,000 Australian pets star (4%) in their own social media profile. 

The Pug's friends include some other spoiled doggies that have their own facebook profiles including Nara Bulldog Francesca and three pugs and a frug and a frenchie.

Research has also revealed, one in five owners (22%) consider using specialist treatments for their pets such as a massage therapist, a dietitian or a naturopath – and a third of owners (32%) admit to speaking to their doted on darlings in baby talk.

These days it's common that pet owners consider their furry pal one of the family.

Not surprisingly, 670,000 owners would include their pet as a beneficiary of their will and a lot of pets even get to lap up the luxury of a holiday with 693,000 owners admitting to booking a flight for them so they can join in on the family fun.

But despite all the ice-cream licking, the dressing up, cuddles and specially cooked meals, the problem is... it seems many aren't getting the basics of pet care right! 

Research found that only 48 per cent of dog owners treat their pets regularly enough to prevent a flea infestation on their pet or in their home.

The more worrying statistic is that 82 per cent of dog owners who live in paralysis tick zones are not treating correctly to protect their dogs from the deadly paralysis tick, which is found along the coast in New South Wales, Queensland and in some parts of Victoria.

Dog trainer and behaviour specialist, and Frontline Plus spokesperson, Amy Smith says, 'I see owners getting obsessive about their ‘furkids’ every day. I’ve seen matching outfits, and dedicated Instagram and Facebook profiles, not to mention prams and handbags.'

'It's important to remember that our pets are part of the family and we must be responsible for their well-being. But it’s our responsibility to know what we need to do and make sure it gets done when it comes to the basics of pet healthcare,' said Smith.

'The problem is that many owners just aren’t aware that they live in tick zones, but we know that paralysis ticks are deadly to dogs and cats. Sadly, a third of dog owners who live in a tick zone have had their dog, or a dog owned by someone they know, die from a paralysis tick'.

Dog owners who live near the coast in tick hot-spots need to treat their dog every two weeks to effectively protect against paralysis ticks, while cat owners, every three weeks.

 Pet owners not living in paralysis tick zones should treat monthly to manage fleas and other types of ticks.And those who are in doubt, it is always good to check with your local veterinarian.

'Protecting your beloved pet from fleas and ticks is vital for its health and happiness. Once you’ve got the basics of caring for your pet sorted, then by all means, pamper them as much as you like!' said Smith.
