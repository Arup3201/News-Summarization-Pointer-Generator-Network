A BBC spokeswoman said there were 445 complaints after Saturday night’s game, which pulled in a peak audience of 15.6 million viewers.

Neville took to Twitter to respond, saying: '1st live co-comm last night - sometimes u have to take the criticism - it will only make me better- thanks for the feedback (ahhahaha)!'

Fellow broadcaster Danny Baker was among his critics, but said the BBC should share the blame.

He said: 'Phil Neville has acknowledged he wasn’t great during England commentary. But what were the BBC doing giving him THAT game to ‘learn his craft’?'

The BBC said Neville, who has received broadcasting training, was 'an important, well-respected member of our team” and would “continue to play a key role throughout the tournament'.

His next appearance is expected to be as a studio guest for tonight’s game between Iran and Nigeria.
