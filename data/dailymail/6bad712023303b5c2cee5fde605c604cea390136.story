A teacher who slipped on a puddle of water at school was received £23,000 of taxpayers' money in compensation, it was revealed today.

West Sussex County Council was forced to pay out nearly a full year's salary after the teacher took them to court arguing that the council was responsible for their injuries.

The teacher claimed to have suffered ligament damage in the feet and ankle following the fall.

Although the council attempted to fight the claim, the teacher took them to court and won a judgement in their favour.

Details of the claim were revealed in reponse to a Freedom of Information request - but the identity of the teacher cannot be made public because of data protection laws.

The compensation payment of £23,000 is higher than the annual starting salary for a teacher, with the average teacher outside London earning around £27,000.

West Sussex also paid £18,000 in compensation to someone who was hit in the shoulder by an electric door.

The local fire and rescue service was forced to pay £5,000 to an employee who hurt their shoulder while lifting a fence - despite the routine danger which firefighters expose themselves to.

The neighbouring council, East Sussex, paid out £54,000 to a worker who tripped on a school step, and £72,000 for a 'playground accident'.

Brigthon's city council has also fallen prey to large compensation claims in the past few years.

One worker who claimed to have developed tinnitus thanks to a high-pitched alarm was awarded £5,000.

Another person claimed £4,685 after a CCTV monitor fell from a desk onto their foot.

A spokesman for West Sussex council insisted that the authority does not automatically agree to hand out large compensation payments to anyone who complains.

'The county council examines the merits of all claims and, where they are large, does so in consultation with its insurers,' he siad.

'Where a claim is fully supported by evidence then a settlement will be considered so as to save incurring costs of unnecessary litigation. Where that is not the case the matter will be resisted.

'Claims, however small, are never paid out unless they are supported by strong evidence that the council has been negligent.

'As a large employer and an organisation with many buildings to operate, the county council will be on the receiving end of claims resulting from accidents at work.'
