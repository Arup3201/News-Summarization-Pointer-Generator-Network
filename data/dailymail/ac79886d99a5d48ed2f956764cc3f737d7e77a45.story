The most disturbing aspect of the Richard Scudamore sexist email controversy has been the way the whole affair has been swept under the carpet by the Rupert Murdoch empire.

The story involving the most powerful figure in English football has been practically ignored or given the slimmest of coverage by Sky and the News International newspapers — despite dominating the agenda elsewhere.

Sky’s Premier League packages have been pivotal to their sports business since the formation of the top flight in 1992, while the Sun and the Times became PL partners in the current deal with their digital rights to show clips of goals from 380 matches.

Serious: The Premier League have hired a crisis management agency to try and help Richard Scuadamore

And not wanting to jeopardise these relationships with the PL can be the only reason such an important football issue has not received the attention it merited from the Murdoch media.

It’s understood the message has come down from on high not to get involved in the Scudamore debate, much to the angst of female staff on Sky Sports News, while those writing about the beleaguered CEO have had their copy spiked.

A Sky spokesman made no comment.

Quiet: The Times, The Sun and Sky, all part of Rupert Murdoch's empire, have barely covered the Scudamore scandal

It has emerged that Kevin Plumb, head of legal at the Premier League who looks after corporate and commercial affairs, was involved in one of the puerile email exchanges with chief executive Richard Scudamore and DLA Piper lawyer Nick West.

It resulted in Scudamore’s now infamous backing of China’s one-child policy to stem ‘female irrationality’. A statement in response to the allegations of a sexist culture at Gloucester Place made by whistleblower Rani Abraham, a temporary personal assistant to Scudamore, stated: ‘The Premier League continues to be fully committed to treating all staff fairly and on merit, regardless of gender.’

However, it will cause more embarrassment to the League that their senior in-house lawyer is involved in the exchanges when DLA Piper have mounted a full investigation into West’s role.

David Walsh, the award-winning sports journalist responsible for exposing Lance Armstrong, has finally agreed to ghost Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography, to be published by Little, Brown after his confidentiality agreement with the ECB expires in September.

Walsh has started work with Pietersen in India, where the underperforming batsman’s Delhi Daredevils are bottom of the IPL.

Minister for Sport Helen Grant and Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, who never give the impression that sport is high on their DCMS priorities, nevertheless turned up at Wembley for the FA Cup final festivities.

So hopefully Grant, who couldn’t name last year’s Cup winners when ambushed for a sports quiz, will be able to identify Arsenal as the 2014 victors when she is inevitably asked the question.

Premier League to stand by chief

The Premier League’s audit and remuneration committee, who meet on Monday to recommend to clubs what action to take against chief executive Richard Scudamore, are aware there is little or no appetite among the 20 teams to remove him from office.

But the least they can do is to take steps to reform the antiquated governance of the League which has just a two-man board in Scudamore and interim chairman Peter McCormick, one of his shooting pals.

Lawyer McCormick was heavily criticised in the FA panel report for the shambolic way he represented Luis Suarez in the Patrice Evra racism case.

And it can’t be right that Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, another member of that shooting party, continues to chair the committee that decides Scudamore’s seven-figure bonuses and salary.

Doubt: There are growing concerns whether Scuadamore's friend Bruce Buck should be A and R chairman

The PL clubs last discussed increasing their board four years ago. But when Bolton chairman Phil Gartside recommended bringing in FA chairman Lord Triesman — Scudamore’s arch foe — he found no support.

Meanwhile, the League would not disclose who is paying for the expensive services of Milltown Partners, the crisis management agency brought in last week to reinforce the effort to keep Scudamore in office.
