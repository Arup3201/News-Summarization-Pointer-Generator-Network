The Van Gaal/Mourinho love-in made me sick

In a short space of time, Liverpool have gone from having one of the best strikers in their history scoring their goals, to having potentially one of the worst strikers in their history not scoring goals.

What should the Reds do with Mario?

After the Real Madrid game, the attention given to the half-time shirt swap masked another fairly lame and tame performance from Balotelli.

It’s not the greatest crime, to swap shirts, but it was poor judgment from the Italian.

Forget that though, let’s just focus on the football. Brendan Rodgers listened to all the criticism from ex-Liverpool players and managers who said that Mario should be dropped, or that they believe he won’t be at the club next season.

Rodgers then had no choice but to pick his marquee summer signing. Had he dropped him, it would have appeared that he was bowing down to the critics.

Balotelli showed signs of life against Hull City, but it was far from what could be described as a special performance.

So what should Rodgers do to get more from his man? Or better still, maybe we should ask what can Balotelli do to put things right?

Brendan Rodgers took a gamble by buying Balotelli for £16million in the summer

His lack of pressing and his limited energy are all too noticeable. He is the very antithesis of dynamic.

Rodgers could sit him down and show him what Luis Suarez did last season of course, but then that would simply make Balotelli realise just how inferior he is to the Uruguayan – it could leave his confidence permanently shot, and undermine the relationship between player and manager.

Better still, show him what Alexis Sanchez is doing at Arsenal.

I was at the Stadium of Light at the weekend and not for the first time this season he was the stand-out player on the pitch.

His quality is obvious – that’s why signing him was a no-brainer – we all watched the World Cup, we’d all seen him for Barcelona and for Udinese before that.

What has impressed me more is that he doesn’t wait for things to happen, he makes them happen. He chases lost causes, he causes problems for defenders, his work-rate is astonishing.

And so after almost half an hour on Saturday, Sanchez’s refusal to just stand off Wes Brown and let him control the ball in his own half, then pass the ball unchallenged was rewarded with a mistake from the experienced Sunderland defender, and a clear run on goal for the Arsenal man. He finished superbly.

That’s the kind of pressing Balotelli needs to learn.

And Sanchez kept it up right through to injury time when he grabbed his second. And this is the one that Balotelli really needs to learn from.

In the 92nd minute Sanchez surged towards the Sunderland box. His wayward pass gifted possession to Sunderland, but Sanchez didn’t give up, he chased, forced Vito Mannone into a dreadful error, and picked up a second goal as a result.

Mario needs to be full of running for the whole match – just like Sanchez.

Mario needs to respond better when things go wrong – chase the ball if a pass goes wrong, don’t turn away or throw your arms in the air.

Balotelli is yet to score in the Premier League for Liverpool since joining from AC Milan in the summer

He needs to be dynamic – just like Sanchez is.

The reality for Arsenal is that Sanchez has saved their season so far – he’s been brilliant, so credit to Arsene Wenger for making the signing happen.

If Balotelli takes time out to sit down and watch what Arsenal’s new man is doing, he might work out how to make good things happen for him at Liverpool, and how to prove his critics wrong.
