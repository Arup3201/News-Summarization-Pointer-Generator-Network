Alfreton Town were made to pay for not having a recognised goalkeeper available for selection as midfielder Anthony Howell conceded five goals in his side's FA Cup tie against Lincoln City.

Howell was unable to stop his side from crashing out of the fourth qualifying round of the famous cup competition after agreeing to go in goal.

Manager Nicky Law, whose side were thrashed 5-1 in their replay against Lincoln at the Sincil Bank Stadium, went into the game without a goalkeeper after James Severn and Cameron Dawson picked up injuries.

Alfreton's night was made even worse when former Notts County striker Karl Hawley was shown a straight red card for a foul on Tom Miller in the 70th minute.

Law asked the FA for special dispensation to sign a goalkeeper on an emergency deal but their request was declined.

Lincoln City will play fellow Conference outfit Eastleigh in the next stage of the competition as they look to progress past round one of the FA Cup.
