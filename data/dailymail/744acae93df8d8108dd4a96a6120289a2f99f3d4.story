Georgia Williams, 17, agreed to pose for Jamie Reynolds with a rope around her neck for a 'fantasy photoshoot'

The parents of a teenager murdered by a friend who was obsessed with violent internet porn told yesterday of their anger at how easy it is to find extreme content online.

Georgia Williams, 17, agreed to pose for Jamie Reynolds with a rope around her neck for a ‘fantasy photoshoot’, but he left her hanging and took photographs of her as she died.

Yesterday, her parents Lynette, 52, and Stephen, 58, a detective constable, spoke for the first time about the role extreme pornography played in their daughter’s murder.

They said Reynolds, now 23, had been viewing depraved acts online even as their daughter, who attended college with him, walked to his home 90 minutes before she died.

The heartbroken couple, who have another daughter, Scarlett, 23, want measures against the kind of material that fuelled Reynolds’s fantasies.

Mrs Williams said: ‘Something has to be done about internet porn. I was so naive – I had no idea how easy it is to go on the internet and find the kind of extreme pornography that Reynolds was accessing. It’s horrendous.

‘Worst of all, men, including Reynolds, are re-enacting what they see online.’ 

Reynolds, described by Mr Williams as ‘pure evil’, killed Georgia in May last year while his parents and 19-year-old sister were away, then posed her body around the house in Wellington, Shropshire.

He sent text messages from Georgia’s phone to make her family think she was safe before driving to Wrexham the next morning to dump her body, then continuing north to Glasgow. He was arrested in a budget hotel there three days after the murder.

Sentencing him to a whole-life term at Stafford Crown Court last December, Mr Justice Wilkie said Reynolds was a ‘potential serial killer’ whose ‘long-standing preoccupation with violent and sadistic pornography’ had fuelled Georgia’s killing.

Last month, it was revealed Devon and Cornwall Constabulary will investigate the West Mercia force’s handling of a previous inquiry into Reynolds in 2008, when he tried to strangle another teenage girl lured to his house under the pretence of a photoshoot. 

He was given a caution, despite police discovering doctored pictures of the victim with a noose around her neck.

Mrs Williams had called for an independent investigation, saying her daughter might still be alive if inquiries into that attack had been more thorough.

Her husband, who works for the West Mercia force, which also investigated Georgia’s death, told The Sun yesterday the investigation ‘won’t bring Georgia back but it might save other people’s lives’.

Mr Williams said: ‘He [Reynolds] lynched her for sexual pleasure. I’ve never come across anything quite this cruel. It is pure, pure evil.’ 

Mr Williams added that the murder had destroyed the family, but they have set up a charity, the Georgia Williams Trust, aimed at keeping the teenager’s spirit alive.

In a victory for the Daily Mail’s Block Online Porn campaign to clean up the internet, UK families were given a choice last year whether to opt in or block online pornography from home networks.
