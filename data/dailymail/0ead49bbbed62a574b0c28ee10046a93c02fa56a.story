UKIP will inflict much more damage on the Conservatives than Labour in next year’s general election, increasing the chances of Ed Miliband entering Downing Street, according to authoritative new research.

Its voters have overwhelming come from those who voted Conservative in 2010 – and even the Liberal Democrats have shed more to them than Labour, election experts say.

Most so-called ‘core Labour’ voters switching to Ukip had already deserted the party between 2001 and 2010 as a reaction to Tony Blair and New Labour, they have found.

By contrast, switches from the Conservatives to Nigel Farage’s party are more recent and still happening – seriously undermining David Cameron’s chances of winning a Commons majority in May.

Other findings of researchers at the British Election Study (BES) suggest the Lib Dems are on course for far greater losses next year than most have assumed.

An analysis of the party’s support suggests it could do worse than ‘the already dire overall vote share in the polls and they are at risk of losing more than the half of their seats’.

Meanwhile, a doubling of support for the Scottish Nationalists presages ‘big Labour losses’ north of the border and a ‘potentially pivotal role for the SNP in a hung parliament’.

The rise of Ukip, the SNP and the Greens has prompted increasing fears in Whitehall that British voters are set to return a hung parliament for the second election in succession – the first time there would have been such an outcome since 1910.

The collapse of the Lib Dems means that it is increasingly possible that only a three-party coalition will be able to muster enough seats to command a Commons majority.

Tim Farron, the frontrunner to succeed Nick Clegg, has hinted the country could be ruled by coalition of Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP.

Alex Salmond, the former Scottish First Minister, announced at the weekend that he is to run for a Westminster seat for the SNP and is dropping ever stronger hints about his desire to play a key role in determining the next government.

Despite a hung parliament being the most likely outcome and a fairer reflection of the fragmented distribution of votes, the two main parties are on course to win 90 per cent of British seats from a combined share of around two-thirds of the vote, according to the BES research.

Professor Geoff Evans, from the University of Oxford, a co-director of the BES, said it was clear David Cameron had most to fear from the rise of Ukip.

Of Ukip supporters in Labour seats, only 18 per cent voted Labour in 2010, whereas 39 per cent were Conservatives,’ he said.

‘Our data shows quite clearly that it’s the Conservative Party who need to worry most about the threat of Ukip - because those people who supported Labour have in the main, already made the switch,’ he said.

‘New Labour’s move to the liberal consensus on the EU and immigration in 2001, 2005 and 2010, left many of their core voters out in the cold a long time before Ukip were around.’

Professor Evans said that because Ukip were picking up long disaffected former Labour voters, it was clear they would not pose such a threat to Labour seats.

‘In October, Labour narrowly held Heywood and Middleton in a strongly contested by-election, which showed high levels of Ukip support in a traditionally Labour voting constituency.

‘But BES data shows how Labour had lost these voters some time ago. Most Ukip voters who had voted Labour in 2005 had not voted for them in 2010. 

Ukip support in Labour constituencies is more likely to be taken from disaffected former Labour voters, and these are far more likely to be manual workers than the middle classes that New Labour appealed to.’

Of Ukip supporters in Labour seats, only 18 per cent voted Labour in 2010, whereas 39 per cent were Conservatives.

Professor Jane Green from the University of Manchester, another co-director of the BES, said separate research showed that contrary to the popular view, Ukip is no more successful at winning over the politically disengaged than the other parties.

Only the Greens are set to gain more in 2015 from people who didn’t vote in either the 2005 and 2010 elections,’ she said. Previous non-voters make up 19 per cent of those intending to vote Green – far higher than the other parties.

As a percentage of all voters, those shifting to Labour and Conservative from not voting is higher than Ukip: 2.7 per cent for Labour, 2.2 per cent for Conservative but only for 1.4 per cent for Ukip.
