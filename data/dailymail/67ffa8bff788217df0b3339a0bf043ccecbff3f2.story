Jermain Defoe is a target for a number of Premier League clubs before the transfer window shuts.

QPR are leading the chase for the former England man as Harry Redknapp looks to reunite with the striker who starred under him at Tottenham, but Leicester and Newcastle are also interested.

Defoe is ready to end his spell at Toronto FC after the MLS club sacked manager Ryan Nelsen - and he would prefer a move to London.

On the move: Toronto striker Jermain Defoe is wanted by a number of Premier League clubs on deadline day

Target: QPR boss Harry Redknapp is keen on Defoe but Leicester and Newcastle are also interested

Brief stay: Defoe has been with Toronto for less than a year but he could be on the move again

QPR have made Defoe their top target with Loic Remy joining west London rivals Chelsea, but Arsenal and Tottenham have also been made aware of his availability.

However, Redknapp is also eyeing up a move for Dynamo Kiev's Dutch international Jeremain Lens.

Lens, a 26-year-old striker who can play wide or central, moved to Kiev last summer for nearly £9million after three prolific years at PSV Eindhoven.

Dynamo want to recoup the bulk of the fee but are aware many overseas players want to leave Ukraine because of the political instability.
