Majid Khan, 30, who has been jailed for 16 and a half years after flooding the north-east of England with heroin and cannabis, using his car wash business in Middlesbrough

A drug gang mastermind who used an accomplice behind bars to flood the north-east of England with heroin and cannabis has been jailed for 16-and-a-half years.

Majid Khan, 30, used his carwash business in Middlesbrough, Teesside, as a disguise for his multi-million pound plot to distribute drugs.

Another man involved in the scheme is already serving a 14-year sentence behind bars. Teesside Crown Court heard how convicted drugsman Imran Bashir helped to orchestrate the team.

Bashir, 36, discussed the plan during a prison visit when his wife used her mobile phone to host a conference call with Khan.

Although both men spoke English, their conversations - recorded by prison bosses - were mostly in Urdu and contained code.

Police only managed to recover drugs worth £300,000 but the court heard how the trade was worth millions.

Judge Howard Crowson ruled that 
Bashir, from Droylesden, Manchester, will start a seven-year sentence at
the end of the term he is currently serving.

Khan's right-hand man, Mohammed Akram,
25, described by the judge as 'a trusted second in command' received 
ten years and four months.

Six other men involved in the plot, 
from Middlesbrough, Greater Manchester and Bedfordshire, were jailed for
between three years and seven months and nine years.

Bashir's wife, Aliya Bashir Khan, 32, a
Muslim convert born Michelle Berlotti, from Droylesden, Manchester, 
received a community order after she admitted converting criminal 
property.

The court heard 
that she received £2,100 from the crims but her barrister said it was 
'to maintain the family home and not to fund an extravagant lifestyle'.

Majid
Khan and Akram, both from Middlesbrough, Teesside, were found guilty 
after a six-week trial of conspiracy to supply Class A and Class B 
drugs.

Qaisr Rasaq, 26, 
from Middlesbrough, Teesside, and Asad Mahmood, 40, from Oldham, were 
convicted of being part of the plot to supply heroin, and received nine 
years.

A judge at Teeside Crown Court described the gang as well-organised and determined

Middlesbrough street dealer Terence Agiadis, 24, was jailed for four-and-a-half years.

His 'gopher' Tobias Williamson, 21, received three years and seven months. Majid Hussain, 38, the 'main player' from the Bedfordshire supply line, admitted the heroin conspiracy charge and was given a nine-year sentence by Judge Crowson.

Mohammed Nadeem, 39, from Bedford, a 'courier' caught with a 1kg package was jailed for four years after he admitted posessing Class A drugs with an intent to supply.

Asif Hussain, 29, from Middlesbrough, Teesside, will be sentenced next week after he admitted conspiracy to supply heroin. He was another of Majid Khan's trusted lieutenants.

Judge Crowson described the gang as well-organised and determined.

He said: 'This trade brings misery to users and, perhaps more importantly, victims of crime.'

After the case, Detective Inspector Dave Mead, who led the inquiry, said: 'I would like to pay tribute to the investigation team who worked tirelessly to dismantle this heroin supply network which spanned across the country.'

The court heard Majid Khan continued even though police disrupted supplies on two occasions - finding a total of 3kg of heroin.
