Luxury travellers don't just look for unique experiences on their holidays, they also want to pamper their pets, according to new research.

Whether it is ordering caviar or simply requesting a 'sausage dog girlfriend' for their pets, high end travellers expect the best from their hotels.

In a worldwide survey, looking at the demands made by holidaymakers, many
 of the most bizarre suggestions came from dog owners in China, with American requests not far behind.

Facilities: At Hoteldorf Grüner Baum in Bad Gastein, Austria, there is a dog training 'play meadow' next to the hotel, where an expert dog trainer offers individual consultations

Lap of luxury: Some of the most bizarre suggestions came from dog owners in China, which included 'pata negra ham and cavier', 'unlimited playtime', and 'a sausage dog girlfriend'

While luxury foods, 'unlimited playtime' and pet girlfriends were requested by Chinese travellers, suggestions from the USA included 'blueberry facials' and 'bird-watching at a zoo' for their cat.

A
 UK pet owner proposed 'a personal butler', while the dream holiday for 
one Burmese cat in Australia would involve 'someone spending the day 
with her and telling her how beautiful she is'.

The survey, conducted by Small Luxury Hotels of the World (SLH), found that of over 8,000 people worldwide, seven per cent of respondents said that they would travel with their pet whenever possible.

Around 15 per cent said that they would be willing to pay a supplement for their pets to be pampered, with the top pet pampering items identified by respondents including luxury bedding (14 per cent), food (11 per cent) and pet grooming (eight per cent).

Top priority: Demands made by luxury travellers in the USA included 'blueberry facials' and 'bird-watching at a zoo' for their cat

Man's best friend: Out of over 8,000 people worldwide, 7.3 per cent of respondents said that they would travel with their pet whenever possible

Recognising the trend for pets on holiday, many SLH properties have introduced pet friendly 
packages, so beloved animals can have a luxury holiday experience just 
as much as their owners.

One
 of the hotels run by SLH, Hoteldorf Grüner Baum in Bad Gastein, 
Austria, provides a dog training ‘play meadow’ next to the hotel, where a
 expert dog trainer offers individual consultations.

Dogs
 can also take advantage of a number of physiotherapy options, starting 
with an examination by a vet to identify the most beneficial treatment.

Massages, lymphatic drainage and active-passive movement exercises are 
all available with the help of laser therapy, ultrasound machines and 
hot and cold treatment equipment.

There
 are also a number of specific wellness packages on offer, such as the 
metabolism package, involving a nutrition consultation, and a deep 
balance package that includes overall regeneration and detoxification.

The ‘Fitness for Older Dogs’ programme offers joint mobilisation, muscle building and an exercise programme to take home.

Devoted: Around 15.1 per cent of respondents said that they would be willing to pay a supplement for their pets to be pampered

Companion: The top pet pampering items identified by respondents included luxury bedding, food and pet grooming

Lainston
 House Hotel in Winchester, UK, also offiers a VIP (Very Important 
Pooch) package means that four legged best friends don’t have to be left
 at home, with a number of bedrooms and suites available to book that 
have a patio door leading straight out to the hotel grounds.

Similarly,
 the Raithwaite Estate in Whitby, UK, has a number of dog-friendly rooms
 and cottages and luxury facilities, but for those dogs that prefer a 
holiday away from their owners, there are also onsite kennels.

The pet findings come as part of research by SLH revealing new trends within the luxury market. 

Italy has been identified as the most
 luxurious holiday destination, Chanel as the most popular exclusive brand 
and free Wi-Fi was favoured over free breakfast in the majority of core 
markets.

When
 asked to specify their favourite luxury holiday destination, Italy and 
destinations within Italy reigned overall chosen by 13 per cent of all 
respondents. 

Workouts: Dogs at Hoteldorf Gruner Baum can also take advantage of a number of physiotherapy options, starting with an examination by a vet to identify the most beneficial treatment

Programmes: There are also a number of specific wellness packages on offer at Hoteldorf Gruner Baum, such as the metabolism package, involving a nutrition consultation, and a deep balance package that includes overall regeneration and detoxification

France and 
destinations within France followed, representing 11.1 per cent, with 
the Maldives taking third place, selected by 8 per cent.

Australia,
 Latin America and the USA all opted for Paris as their favourite luxury
 holiday destination making it the stand-out 'luxury' city whereas 
China, Germany and the UK preferred the Maldives as their number one 
holiday hotspot.

When picking their favourite in-room 
accessory, the majority of respondents (58 per cent) opted for a 
Nespresso/ coffee machine, followed by an I-pod docking system (22 per 
cent).

In the minibar, 
the favourite brand overall was Coca-Cola which featured heavily across 
most core markets with the exception of the UK, Russia and Australia. 

UK
 respondents opted for Bombay Sapphire as their favourite mini bar 
brand. Russian respondents chose Evian, whilst the Australians opted for
 Moët & Chandon.
