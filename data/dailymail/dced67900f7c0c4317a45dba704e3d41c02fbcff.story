Fighting talk: Home Secretary Theresa May says she will pass new legislation which will order judges not to bar foreign criminals from being deported under article 8 of the Human Rights Act

Theresa May yesterday went to war with Britain’s judges after it emerged that almost every successful deportation appeal by a foreign criminal is now based on their human right to ‘a family life’.

The Home Secretary issued instructions to the courts last July that overseas convicts should normally be booted out regardless of their family circumstances.

But immigration judges have been defying her on the grounds that the guidance was not primary legislation so does not carry the same weight as Labour’s Human Rights Act.

Mrs May will now pass a new law demanding that Article 8 of the Act – the right to a family life – should no longer be a bar to deportation. The change will not stop criminals lodging lengthy and expensive appeals. But it sends a clear message to judges that the human rights of criminals should not trump those of the public to be kept safe.

The danger is that – if refused by the British courts – the offenders will simply take their cases to the unelected European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

The latest figures show almost every foreign criminal who cheated deportation last year did so by claiming a human right to a ‘family life’ in Britain. Last year, an estimated 200 criminals were granted permission to remain in the UK in this way.

They add to the stock of 4,000 overseas convicts the Government wants to kick out but is stopped from doing so by human rights legislation.

Mrs May said she hoped that once the law is changed the UK courts will get the message.

She said: ‘Once this primary legislation has been enacted, it is surely inconceivable that judges in this country will maintain that it is they, rather than Parliament, who are entitled to decide how to balance the foreigner’s right to family life against our nation’s right to protect itself.

‘It is depressing that the steps we have already taken should have been insufficient to produce that result. The inevitable delays inherent in passing primary legislation will mean that there will be many more foreign criminals who successfully avoid deportation on the basis that they have a family here.

‘There will also be more victims of violent crimes committed by foreigners in this country – foreigners who should have been, and could have been, deported.’

Last night Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘We need to change the law as a matter of urgency to stem the rampant abuse of the system, protect the public and restore some common sense.’ The plan is to introduce a new Immigration Bill later this year.

- Ministers are refusing to release an estimate of the number of migrants likely to come to Britain from Romania and Bulgaria next year when immigration controls are relaxed. The Foreign Office said the National Institute for Economic and Social Research had carried out a study, but it was still being prepared for possible publication some time in the future.

A Nigerian who returned to Britain after being deported has been jailed for his role in a £2.7million lottery scam.

Osas Odia, 33, was kicked out in 2005 
for using a forged stamp in his passport that allowed him to work. The 
management graduate was allowed to return on a marriage visa after 
marrying a British nurse.

He joined a group of Nigerian fraudsters
 who sent thousands of letters to people across the world telling them 
they had won millions in a lottery but would have to send money to 
‘unlock’ their windfall.

Osas Odia: Returned to the UK on a marriage visa after marrying a British nurseA woman in Bristol who believed she had won £1.8million on the Australian lottery lost £312,000. In Los Angeles a woman who wired £264,000 to the fraudsters was shot dead by her husband when the lottery win never arrived. He then shot himself.Thirteen victims lost an average of £207,000. Odia’s role in the conspiracy was to launder some of the money through three bank accounts in his name. He pleaded guilty at Croydon Crown Court to conspiring to launder criminal property and was jailed for two years on Friday.It is understood that Odia, of Erith, South London, will be allowed to stay in Britain when he is released because of his marital status.

Theresa May is trying to combat the problems caused by Labour's Human Rights Act

Theresa May is attempting to unpick the mess caused by two pieces of Labour legislation: the Human Rights Act and the Borders Act 2007.

Before the Human Rights Act (HRA), there was not a single UK case of deportation of a foreign criminal blocked under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to a family life.

The HRA enshrined Article 8 into British law for the first time. And once the courts were instructed to start considering if a convict had a wife or children living here, the number of adverse rulings exploded.

In 2007, ministers tried to fix this problem with the Borders Act, which stated that anyone sentenced to 12 months or more should normally be kicked out.

However, the legislation then fatally undermined itself by saying this requirement should be subject to the HRA, including Article 8.

Judges continued to balance the right of a convict to stay with their family against their crimes – and routinely found in their favour. Which brings us to 2011, and the Tory party conference. Mrs May announced she wanted to end the abuse of HRA law but, amid Coalition tensions, opted not to do so by passing a new Act of Parliament.

Instead, she issued guidance to the courts saying that, in all bar exceptional circumstances, a foreign criminal should be removed.

To an extent, it worked – with the number of successful Article 8 appeals being reduced from around 400 a year to an estimated 200.

However, some judges continued to flout the Home Secretary’s wishes. In particular, they pointed out that her guidance to judges did not carry the same force of law as a piece of  primary Parliamentary legislation. Mrs May’s hope is that, by now passing an Act of Parliament, the judges will get the message once and for all that no foreign criminal should be spared on Article 8 grounds.

It will not stop foreign criminals from appealing. But a judge would have to explicitly rule against the wishes of Parliament.

The danger for the Government is that somebody will take a test case all the way to the Supreme Court, which will find the new law incompatible with the HRA.

In this instance, the final say over whether to maintain Mrs May’s new rules would technically rest with Parliament. However, in similar cases in the past – namely detaining terror suspects without trial – ministers have crumbled, and agreed to change the law.

It’s also true that, while Britain remains under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, there is nothing to stop convicts dragging their appeals all the way to Strasbourg.
