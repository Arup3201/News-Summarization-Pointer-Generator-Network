Australia has cemented its position as one of the world's fattest nations, a new study has revealed.

The lucky country may not be so lucky coming in as the 25th largest nation in the Global Burden of Disease Study for 2013, which monitored the weight gain of 188 nations over a 33-year period.

Along with New Zealand, Australia has experienced an 80 per cent increase in obesity rates in the past three decades, and it jumped nearly 40 places on the list, the biggest mover - but evidently not in the right way.

Australia sits ahead of many European nations such as France and Germany, but still trailed the U.S. despite figures that show nearly one in three Aussies are considered obese.

The study revealed that not one single nation decreased its overweight and obesity rates during the time period, a concerning statistic that could put pressure on health systems worldwide.

Professor of Public Health at the University of Melbourne Rob Moodie told the Sydney Morning Herald that Australia had to act now if it wants to combat this obesity crisis.

'Waiting for a cure is not possible...The public health system will be crushed by the obesity crisis and the rise in cancer, heart disease and diabetes.'

'We have also failed to get anywhere with front of pack labeling, or with food reformulation, because of a huge resistance from the industry to anything that might improve our health,' Professor Moodie also told the publication.

Put the pressure on: These increased rates will put strain on the public health system

These findings put the strain on the government to cut back on junk food marketing, restore the healthy food-star rating system and push companies to cut sugar and fat contents in their products.

The study, which tracked the weight gain of adults and children from 1980 to 2013, was based on Body Mass Index measurements (BMI) which work on the relationship between height and weight to produce a figure.

Anyone with a BMI of 25 or more is considered overweight, while a rating of 30 or more deems an individual as being obese.

Nearly 30 per cent, or 5.2 million Australian adults, are classified as being obese - compared with a much lower figure of 16 per cent in 1980.

The Global Burden of Disease findings also said that more than half of the world's obese people now live in developing countries, and around a quarter of children are suffering from obesity.

Another concern in Australia is that cuts in the recent budget could have an impact on fighting this obesity trend thanks to funding being scaled back on programs that target prevention in schools and communities.

Professor of Health Policy at Curtin University, Mike Daube, told the publication that obesity has crept up on Australia as a nation and new co-payment scheme may defer people from seeing their GP about the issue.

Obesity is linked to major health problems such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and range of cancers.
