So it has once again fallen on Everton to prevent the Barclays Premier League suffering a week of complete ignominy in Europe.

Roberto Martinez's side have risen to the challenge regularly this season but now they are set for their biggest test here in Dynamo Kiev's Olympic Stadium. 

Can they do it? Sportsmail looks at five reasons why they can keep carrying the flag for England.

BUBBLING CONFIDENCE

Had Everton travelled here last week, their prospects would not have been so positive but the mood is significantly different thanks to back-to-back victories at Goodison Park against Kiev in the first leg and then Newcastle on Sunday.

It is the first time since November Everton have managed to put two results like that together and it has made a big difference to the mood of the squad. Once this group gets on a roll and has confidence, they can meet challenges head on and they won't shirk what is in front of them.

'We know that it is going to be a tough game,' said Seamus Coleman. 'We were very impressed with Kiev in the first leg and they have got good players, like (Andrei) Yarmolenko. But we have come here with confidence and we want to go through to the next round.'

LETHAL LUKAKU

After enduring a difficult spell in the middle of the season, Everton's record signing is beginning to deliver big goals at the right moments. He has scored 10 goals in his last 14 appearances, including the scruffy penalty which secured a first leg advantage.

That strike made him Everton's leading European scorer with seven and he has been proficient at coming up with big moments in this competition, such as hat-trick in Berne and a group-winning goal in Wolfsburg. He will fancy his chances of maintaining that sequence tonight.

DIFFERENT DEMANDS, DIFFERENT TEAM

If Everton have been erratic in the Premier League, playing in Europe has liberated them. Martinez puts domestic struggles down to the fact they lost a lot of ground in the race for fourth place early on and ultimately lost heart for a period.

In Europe, though, they have had a sense of freedom and have been liberated by the chance to achieve something significant. They have won six of their nine games so far and the players are determined to not let the opportunity slip.

'We are going to approach it the way we approach every game,' said Ross Barkley, who will have a key role to fulfil. 'We did well at home and hopefully now we can do that in the away game. We have to be positive and give our all.'

SOMETHING IN THE YEAR?

This is a pithy point but seasons ending with a '5' have been good for Everton; 1985 saw them win the European Cup Winners' Cup. 1995 brought the FA Cup, their last piece of silverware; 2005 ended with David Moyes guiding them to a top four finish, while 1915 heralded their second league title.

Everton will, of course, need more than omens to get through but there has long been a feeling within the squad that they have the ability to go all the way to the final in Warsaw and they want to create their own history.

NO FEAR

Much has been made of Dynamo's formidable home record – they are unbeaten in the Olympic Stadium this season – but Everton are not going to sit back and hope to sneak through. By playing their natural game, Martinez believes they have an outstanding chance of progress.

'We have to be attack minded and when we are on the ball, we need to be a team that wants to score goals and make it very much eye to eye and an open game,' said Martinez. 'That's what I'm looking for tomorrow, that we can make it a game full of chances for us

'I don't want it to be a game where they are a home team, and let them see if they can break us down. That would be a big mistake. It is wanting to achieve something historic and special for us and make our fans proud in Europe – which is what we are doing.'
