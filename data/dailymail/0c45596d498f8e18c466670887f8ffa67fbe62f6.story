When Alan Pardew headed a dramatic FA Cup semi-final winner against Liverpool in 1990, his relationship with Crystal Palace fans changed.

He became a cult hero after his extra-time goal took the Eagles to their only FA Cup final.

Palace fanzine Eagle Eye even gave away ‘Supa Al’ badges showing Pardew flying to the rescue caped crusader-style.

Pardew back in his playing days scored a memorable winner over Liverpool in the FA Cup back in 1990

Until then, there had been misgivings about a semi-pro Yeovil midfielder who quit his full-time job as a glazier to join Palace for £7,500. He had struggled to impose himself in a Palace side built around strikers Ian Wright and Mark Bright.

There were times when Pardew was booed as his name was read out before games.

Pardew, with highlights and a trendy haircut, was better known for his skills as team social secretary, something Steve Coppell — the club’s greatest boss — referenced at a recent Selhurst Park lunch.

Pardew was a grafter but he was no match in midfield for the fans’ favourites Andy Gray, sold to Aston Villa in 1987 before returning in 1989, or the injured captain Geoff Thomas.

Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club

He left for Charlton in 1991 but whenever he has returned as a player or manager, Pardew has always been given a warm reception at Selhurst Park. He has earned it.

This time last year he attended the funeral of former Palace chairman Ron Noades. Among hundreds of mourners, Pardew let it be known that he would love to return to Palace as manager one day.

Now he has the chance.

Pardew played a prominent role in Palace's recording of Glad All Over in the build up to the 1990 FA Cup final
