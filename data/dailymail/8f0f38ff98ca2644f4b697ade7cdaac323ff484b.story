As the grumpy old man of Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson’s grey hair and paunch are as much part of his image as the fast cars.

But as these intimate pictures reveal, the outspoken 54-year-old presenter once enjoyed a mass of dark curls and skinny legs – which he showed off in some very short shorts.

Clarkson is seen in his twenties holidaying with his first wife, Alex Hall, before they were married.

They met in 1982 and married in 1989, but six months later she left him for one of his friends.The photos were taken between 1984 and 1989 on trips to France, Italy and Crete.

Speaking to a Sunday newspaper, twice-divorced Miss Hall, now 47, said: ‘Look how skinny he was then... He looks a darn sight better back then. That’s who I fell in love with.

‘We were usually with a group of friends. Jeremy would be acting the fool, showing off.

'When it was just us two, he was much sweeter. I remember thinking how wonderful it was with him.’

Clarkson – who is reportedly paid almost £1million a year by the BBC for presenting motoring show Top Gear – has been married to his second wife, Frances Cain, 52, for 21 years.
