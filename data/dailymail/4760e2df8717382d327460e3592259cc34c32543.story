The Great Depression of the 1930s was an era of such extreme poverty and dramatic economic decline that it remains permanently etched on our collective psyche.

One major reason for the lasting impression made by the most widespread and deepest depression of the 20th century is that it coincided with the growth of photography as an art form and the period was well-documented as a result.

One of the most famous American photographers documenting the era was Walker Evans, whose beautiful and sometimes haunting photographs captured such detail and emotion that the subjects feel more alive and closer to the present than the past.

Country Store and Gas Station, Alabama, 1936: During a decade of profound transformation, Evans created a collective portrait of the Eastern United States through his work for the Farm Security Administration that now acts almost as a Modernist history of photography

Parked Car, Small Town Main Street, 1932: Evans said his goal as a photographer was to make pictures that were 'literate, authoritative, transcendent'

Evans said that his goal as a photographer was to make pictures that were 'literate, authoritative, transcendent.'

Such was the influence of Evans' work that he was the subject of the first exhibition - 'Walker Evans: American Photographs' - devoted to a single photographer at the Museum of Modern Art in New York some 75 years ago. 

At the same time a landmark book – ‘Studio’ – was published which comprised approximately 60 prints of his indivisible art works from that MOMA collection.

Now to celebrate the 75th anniversary of that landmark collection, MOMA is once again displaying Evans’ finest work and ‘Studio’ has been reissued.

Evans' landmark book 'Studio'  was published in 1938 and includs approximately 60 prints of his indivisible art work including American Legionnaire, 1936 (left) and Alabama Cotton Tenant Farmer Wife, 1936 (right)

42nd Street, New York, 1929: Such was the influence of Evans' work that he was the subject to the first exhibition - 'Walker Evans: American Photographs' - devoted to the work of a single photographer at the Museum of Modern Art in New York some 75 years ago

Negro Barber Shop Interior, Atlanta, 1936: The pictures provide neither a coherent narrative nor a singular meaning, but rather create connections through the repetition and interplay of pictorial structures and subject matter

During a decade of profound transformation, Evans created a collective portrait of the Eastern United States through his work for the Farm Security Administration that now acts almost as a Modernist history of photography.

The 2013 installation of Walker Evans' work maintains the bipartite organization of the originals: the first section portrays American society through images of its individuals and social contexts, while the second consists of photographs of American cultural artifacts - the architecture of Main streets, factory towns, rural churches, and wooden houses.

The pictures provide neither a coherent narrative nor a singular meaning, but rather create connections through the repetition and interplay of pictorial structures and subject matter.

In 1935, Evans spent two months at first on a fixed-term photographic campaign for the Resettlement Administration in West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

From October on, he continued to do photographic work for the RA and later the Farm Security Administration, primarily in the Southern United States. Evans continued to work for the FSA until 1938.

Evans later became a staff writer at Time magazine and then an editor at Fortune magazine before he became a professor of photography on the faculty for Graphic Design at the Yale University School of Art. He died at his home in Lyme, Connecticut, in 1975.
