They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned - and here's a woman who's taken that fury to a terrifying new level.

When 26-year-old Torz Reynolds found out her boyfriend of two years had been cheating on her she took revenge, in the most gruesome way possible.

Miss Reynolds, from London, had thought Stuart 'Chopper' May broke up with her because he moved to Alaska to take a dream job. She even saw him off, tearfully, at the airport.

But a week later Miss Reynold found out he had instead allegedly moved in with a woman he'd allegedly been having an affair with for six months.

Torz Reynolds took bloody revenge by removing a tattoo of her cheating ex-boyfriend's name with a scalpel. She then sent the severed skin to him by post

So, taking a scalpel to her arm, she removed tattoo she had done of nickname 'Chopper' and then sent the severed skin to him by post.

Miss Reynolds was shocked when she discovered from friends that Chopper was still in the UK and had allegedly moved in with his new woman.

It took her an hour and a half to carefully slicing the skin from her arm. She then used a pair of dissection tweezers to peel the skin back.

Afterwards, the remnants of the tattoo were put in a jar, wrapped up with a bow and sent via recorded delivery to her former lover.

Miss Reynolds even tracked it online so she knew for definite that Chopper, 24, had received it.

Miss Reynolds, originally from Colchester, Essex, said: 'I packaged it up so it really did look like a present. I even used different handwriting so he'd have no idea that it was me.

'I can't imagine what his reaction was. I wish I could have been there to see it.'

With no anaesthetic and using only a 
bottle of Vasocaine numbing spray to halt the bleeding, Miss Reynolds 
made a rectangular incision around the tattoo. Afterwards, she used the 
tweezers to peel back the corners.

'I don't like pain, but the skin 
coming off was actually quite relaxing. It was the after-pain that hurt 
the most. It felt like a nasty stinging sensation and putting on clothes
 was a difficult task,' said Miss Reynolds.

'I'd
 always planned to send the skin to Chopper. After I had posted it to 
him, I didn't receive a response from him.

'Removing
 the tattoo like that was definitely closure. I like to get over things 
quickly and I always delete someone completely out of my life.'

Miss
 Reynolds, a body piercer at the King's Cross Tattoo Parlour, says that 
Chopper had seemed like 'the perfect boyfriend'. She got the words 
‘Chopper's Bitch' tattooed a year into their doomed relationship.

'Chopper did everything for me, I never had to ask him for anything. I thought he was brilliant and so did all of my friends.

'I got the tattoo of Choppper's name done as a surprise and he was really proud of it. The inking was on my forearm so whenever I lifted my pint glass, all his mates would see it and be amazed.'

However,
 when Miss Reynolds moved to London in late 2013, Chopper suddenly 
became distant and stopped answering her calls and messages.

When she 
finally managed to reach him, Chopper claimed he had got his dream job 
offer to do pipeline work in Alaska and had been dreading giving the 
news to Miss Reynolds.

The
 couple had a tearful separation, promising to meet up again if he ever 
returned from Alaska. Miss Reynolds even saw him off at the airport.

But
 a few days later, she as told by mutual friends that Chopper had never
 gone to Alaska. Instead he was still in his hometown of Tiptree, Essex, 
with the girl he had cheated on Miss Reynolds with for over half a year.

It was this revelation which prompted Miss Reynolds to forcibly remove her tattoo of Chopper's name and get vengeance on him.

She explains, 'Posting the tattoo to Chopper sent a clear message. Now he knows never to mess with me again.'

The
 macabre act polarized opinion amongst Miss Reynolds's family and 
friends. Some found it repugnant with certain individuals falling out 
with her over it. Whilst others have commended Miss Reynolds, expressing
 a desire to have their own tattoo dedicated to an ex removed.

Miss
 Reynolds reckons that people take what she did too seriously: 'At the 
end of the day, it's only skin and it will grow back.

Stuart 'Chopper' May refused to comment.
