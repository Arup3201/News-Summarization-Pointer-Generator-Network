A 34-year-old South Carolina woman was arrested last week after authorities say her gun was found in her 2nd-grade daughter's backpack at an elementary school where she works as a parent volunteer.

Heather Sederbaum was arrested Friday and has been charged with carrying a weapon on school property and unlawful conduct towards a child after the child alerted her teacher that she found her mother's gun in her backpack.

Police were called to the Newington Elementary School on February 6, after the little girl discovered the gun in her bag at the end of the school day.

Armed: Heather Sederbaum showed the gun to other parents at the school the day before it was found in her daughter's backpack

Authorities say that after finding the gun the girl immediately told her teacher, who took the black and pink Ruger .380, told the principal and then called police.

The previous day, another parent volunteer at the school said Sederbaum bragged about having the gun on school property.

'She opened up her purse and showed us a gun that was black and pink. 
And the other volunteer said you cannot have that on school premise,' the volunteer, who asked to remain anonymous, told live5news.com. 'She said she had a concealed weapons permit. I was 
shocked.'

The anonymous volunteer says she told another volunteer about Sederbaum's gun and she then told the school's principal.

Additionally, the anonymous woman says that prior to the discovery of the gun in the little girl's backpack., Sederbaum confronted another mother who asked her if carrying a gun on school property was a good idea. According to Live 5, Sederbaum became flustered and left.

Authorities say the little girl's teacher told police that Sederbaum had gone to her daughter's classroom the day the gun was found in the girl's backpack and asked if she could put a book in the girl's bag. The teacher says Sederbaum left with the backpack and then returned it to the classroom.

Outrage: Parents at the school are unhappy that the principal didn't tell them about the gun that was found until the next day

A few hours later, Sederbaum's daughter told her teacher that her mother's gun was in her backpack.

It wasn't until about 5:45 p.m. the following day that parents were told that a gun had been found at Newington Elementary, which has some parents angry that they weren't notified immediately.

'[The] gun was found in [the] backpack on Thursday. How can you say it's not an immediate danger," one parent told the station. 'What if that child had picked up that weapon and the gun would have gone off and somebody would have gotten shot?'
