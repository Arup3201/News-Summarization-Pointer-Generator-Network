A spine-tingling video showing around 200 New Zealand soldiers performing the Maori haka at the funeral of three fallen comrades has gone viral.

Members of the 2nd and 1st Battalion Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment performed the ancestral war cry to show their 'collective grief' at the deaths of Corporal Luke Tamatea, 31, Lance Corporal Jacinda Baker, 26, and 21-year-old Private Richard Harris.

Footage of Saturday's service has been viewed more than 340,000 times on YouTube since being released by the NZ Defence Force.

Strong tradition: The haka is a war cry or dance originally performed by Maori warriors before battle and is characterised by vigorous arm movements, stamping of the feet and rhythmically shouted accompaniment

John Key, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, which has lost ten soldiers in Afghanistan, said the country would withdraw from the conflict in early 2013.

They had been due to leave later that year, but Mr Key stressed talks on early withdrawal had started before the trio's deaths.

The haka is a traditional war cry or dance originally performed by Maori warriors before battle and is characterised by vigorous arm movements, stamping of the feet and rhythmically shouted accompaniment.

Today, haka form a crucial part of ceremonies for dignitaries to create a sense of occasion.

There are various forms, perhaps the best-known of which is performed by the All Blacks rugby union team before matches.
