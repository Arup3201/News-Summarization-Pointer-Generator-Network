American investment firm Cain Hoy claimed on Friday they were discussing a buy-out of Tottenham Hotspur.

However, the London club, whose players face Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on Saturday have strenuously denied the claims, insisting their dialogue with Cain Hoy has centred solely around the prospect of investment for their prospective new stadium.

Earlier on Friday the company released a statement that read: ‘Cain Hoy confirms that it is at the preliminary stages of assessing a cash offer for Tottenham Hotspur.

'Cain Hoy’s considerations are at an early stage, and there can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made or at what price that might be.

'In accordance with the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, Cain Hoy must, by no later than 5pm on October 10, 2014, to either announce a firm intention to make an offer or announce that it does not intend to.

‘This deadline will only be extended with the consent of the Takeover Panel in accordance with the Code. This announcement has been made without the consent of Tottenham Hotspur and a further announcement will be made in due course.’ 

However, Spurs were quick to refute Cain Hoy’s claims by releasing a statement of their own.

It read: ‘Tottenham Hotspur Limited (THFC) notes the continuing press reports surrounding a potential takeover and the announcement released by Cain Hoy Enterprises, LLC (Cain Hoy). THFC confirms it is not in takeover discussions with Cain Hoy or any other party.

THFC has been in discussions with multiple providers of finance so that the optimum financing package for the project can be achieved and, in the course of those considerations, has met representatives of Cain Hoy. There are no ongoing discussions with Cain Hoy.’

Meanwhile, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino has revealed that anger over his side’s 3-0 defeat by Liverpool drove him to watch the match more than 20 times during the international break and look at his squad’s approach. ‘The players were away and we had a short squad and we had time to analyse,’ he said.

‘We need to create this winning mentality and to believe in our skill and power and this is one thing we need to improve. We need to have a chat, to watch the clips of different situations and work hard and improve each other.’
