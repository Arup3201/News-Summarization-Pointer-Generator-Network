Only on Sunday, September 28, will we know if European captain Paul McGinley got his Ryder Cup wildcard picks right. 

He has a thankless task — but a great many in the game would support his decision to disappoint Luke Donald.  

Trio: Europe captain Paul McGinley named Stephen Gallacher, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood as his wildcards

Excluded: There was no place for Luke Donald in McGinley's European Ryder Cup team

Trio: McGinley's three selections for the Ryder Cup, which takes place at Gleneagles at the end of September

A former world No 1 who has never lost a Ryder Cup foursomes game and forms an impressive partnership with Sergio Garcia, Donald is unfortunately in horrible form right now and could only have been picked ahead of Stephen Gallacher on reputation. 

The same can be said of Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter — but Westwood has shown glimpses of his old self of late, while Poulter was in miserable nick in 2012, too, yet somehow pulled it together for a superhuman effort as Europe won at Medinah. 

It would be awfully cruel to reject him now, so Donald it is. Harsh, but fair. And probably right.
