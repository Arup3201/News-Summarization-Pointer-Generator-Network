Findings: Around one in ten senior teachers said children at their school aged between five and seven were still not toilet trained

Hundreds of children aged five and older are still wearing nappies in primary schools, a survey suggests.

It found around one in ten senior teachers said children at their school aged between five and seven were still not  toilet trained.

There were even perfectly healthy pupils in their teens – without medical conditions or developmental problems – who were  unable to go to the bathroom on their own, it was reported.

The worrying findings came in a Sky News survey of schools in England, which is the first to show the problem extends past the first year of school. Teachers also warned that growing numbers of young children were starting school without other basic skills, such as being able to hold a knife and fork properly or use a paintbrush.

The survey was carried out by the National Foundation for Educational Research, which asked head teachers and staff in England about their experiences of children coming to schools still having to wear nappies.

Nine per cent – almost one in ten – of heads and senior staff said that in the past year a child aged between five and seven had worn a nappy to their school. If representative of schools across England, it would mean up to 1,600 of England’s 16,000 primary schools had at least one pupil aged over five still wearing nappies in the  past year. 

The survey found a lower figure, however, for classroom teachers, 5 per cent of whom said they had children still in nappies at that age. Four per cent – almost one in 20 – of heads and senior staff said that in the last year a child aged seven to 11 had worn a nappy to school.

One per cent of classroom teachers surveyed had experience of older children with the problem. There has been growing evidence in recent years that increasing numbers of children are starting school without being fully toilet trained.

Experts say it is not just pupils from 
deprived backgrounds who are having problems but those who have working 
parents too busy to address the issue.

Worrying: Nine per cent - almost one in ten - of heads and senior staff said that in the past year a child aged between five and seven had worn a nappy to their school

Anne-Marie Middleton runs a programme at a Kent school to help pupils go to the bathroom on their own. She says many pupils are too embarrassed to admit they still wear nappies.

She said: ‘We’re seeing more and more children wearing nappies.

‘We find that more and more  children have an issue with toilet training further up the school. I know of one 11-year-old who has to wear pull-ups at night. It can really place a strain on teachers. It stops lessons.’

Life Skills: Teachers also warned that growing numbers of young children were starting school without other basic skills, such as being able to hold a knife and fork properly or use a paintbrush

Miss Middleton says parents’ busy lives are often at the root of the problem with pupils arriving at school without many basic life skills. As well as being unable to go to the bathroom without help, they have no idea of table manners or even how to hold a paintbrush.

Janet Marsh, a teacher from Dover, said she knew of some 15-year olds without medical problems who still had toilet training problems. ‘It’s an incredibly serious situation,’ she said.

‘There are children who miss 25 per cent of their education in reception because they’re being taken out to be changed. How are they going to catch up?’
