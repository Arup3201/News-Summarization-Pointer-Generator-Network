A 20-year-old Michigan State University student has died and his roommate was injured during a shooting at their apartment.

Business student Dominique Nolff died this morning from multiple gunshot wounds after he was shot in his home the night before.

His roommate, Corbin Holwerda, was shot once in the attack, which police said 'does not appear to be a random act'.

East Lansing police are looking for a black man aged between 20 and 25, after finding the victims critically injured in their Cedar Village apartment near the campus.

An emergency alert was texted to staff and students on the campus immediately after the shooting, with a description of the suspect.

Family and friends of Dominique paid tribute to the sports-loving student, who died in hospital at about 9.20am on Saturday.

'He was a gentlemen; he loved people. He would do anything for anybody,' Dominique's aunt, Heather Bush, told M Live.

As news of the tragic killing spread, Dominique's friends paid tribute to him on social media networks and shared photos of the student fooling around and spending time with his family.

Messages of support were left for the victim's family and friends, who mourned the loss of a promising student and athlete.

His brother, Trenton Marquis Bouie, changed his Facebook profile picture to one showing him grinning next to Dominique.

A friend commented: 'I always looked up to u guys but now that a very good man is gone I still will look up to both of u.'

In a show of solidarity the student's parents, former girlfriend, Hannah Lapekes, and several friends also changed their profile pictures to show them with Dominique.

East Lansing Mayor Nathan Triplett reached out to the families of the two students through his Facebook page.

'East Lansing residents woke up this morning to another headline about senseless gun violence. This time it was in our own backyard. My thoughts are with the two victims and their families,' the post read.
