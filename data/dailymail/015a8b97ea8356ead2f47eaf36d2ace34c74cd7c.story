'Was the dream worth it?' Richard Branson has admitted that he seriously questioned whether to continue with his space travel project after the fatal Virgin Galactic crash in October

Richard Branson has admitted that the fatal Virgin Galactic crash forced him to re-evaluate whether he should continue with his dream of civilian space travel.

The company's SpaceShipTwo rocket plane disintegrated over the Mojave desert in October, killing one pilot and injuring the other.

In a New Year's Day blog posting, the Virgin Galactic founder revealed how he was riddled with doubts about the multi-million-pound venture as he flew to California hours after the crash.

He wrote: 'I found myself questioning seriously for the first time, whether in fact it was right to be backing the development of something that could result in such tragic circumstances. 

'In short — was Virgin Galactic and everything it has stood for and dreamt of achieving, really worth it?

'I got a very firm answer to that question immediately when I landed in Mojave. 

'From the designers, the builders, the engineers, the pilots and the whole community who passionately believed — and still believe — that truly opening space and making it accessible and safe is of vital importance to all our futures.'

Co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed in the accident and pilot Peter Siebold was seriously injured but managed to escape after activating his parachute system. 

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) says cockpit video showed that Mr Alsbury prematurely pulled a lever that unlocked the feathering system which is designed to slow the craft's descent before landing.

But when the action was taken moments after the plane's rockets had fired, it generated huge aerodynamic forces that tore it apart.

The NTSB has not yet reported their conclusions on the cause of the crash or its recommendations for Virgin Galactic's future operations. 

Branson continued on the blog: 'I heard the same, heartfelt message at the incredibly moving memorial service for Mike Alsbury a week later and I heard and saw it in the thousands of messages that poured into my office from all around the world – and in one case, even beyond the world, from the astronauts on the International Space Station. 

'I also heard, and saw, and felt it, from our Future Astronauts in an outpouring of support and solidarity which was at once humbling and uplifting.'

The Virgin Galactic project, which has signed up 700 customers for sub-orbital trips at $250,000 a seat, is pressing ahead with the venture while the National Transportation Safety Board continues its investigation into the disaster.

WhiteKnightTwo, the aircraft that took SpaceShipTwo up for launch, was taken out for a practice flight by pilots before the Christmas break, company's vice president for special projects, Will Pomerantz, told NBC News.

A second SpaceShipTwo plane is also under construction.

Branson concluded his posting with a message for the future.

'When this story is told in years to come, I believe alongside the bravery of Mike and the incredible tale of Pete's survival will stand the story of the commitment, loyalty and passion of the world's first private astronauts,' Branson wrote. 

'And so Virgin Galactic goes on, with an unwavering commitment to safety and a renewed sense of purpose.

'Thanks to everyone who has supported Virgin Galactic in 2014 and here’s to the next chapter in 2015.'
