Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton has signed a new three-year contract at Turf Moor.

The 28-year-old kept 19 clean sheets during the Clarets' promotion from the SkyBet Championship and had only 12 months left on his existing deal, although there was an option for a further year extension.

Heaton is now looking forward to playing in the top flight, having made a prediction Burnley would reach the Premier League when he arrived last summer from Bristol City.

'It was certainly the ambition when I signed here only 12 months ago and obviously it was a fantastic season,' he told Clarets Player.

'It's great to be a part of it. I feel that personally I have got more to come and I'm really excited to show that here.

'We will set our stall out ambitious again and the aim is to stay in the Premier League and then kick on from there.

'I think I'm the eternal optimist but you never know what you can achieve and I think I've been in the game long enough to know what is around the corner if you do things properly.

'If you do that as individuals and a collective then you give yourself a great chance and that will certainly be the motto from me again.

'People will write us off but we'll just try and go about our business the way we did last year and hopefully that will stand us in good stead.'

Looking forward: Heaton and Burnley are aiming to secure Premier League survival next season
