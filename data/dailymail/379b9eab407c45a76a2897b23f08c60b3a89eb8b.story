Roadside campaign: Earl Martinez has taken his bid to find a kidney donor to the streets walking around Beaverton, Oregon, with a homemade sign

A father of three in desperate need of a kidney has taken his campaign to the roadside armed with just a sandwich board and the hope a stranger will save his life.

28-year-old Earl Martinez from Beaverton, Oregon, has been walking the streets of his town with a sign reading 'Need Kidney donor'

Married Martinez has been waiting for more than a year for a transplant, receiving dialysis three times a week at Oregon Health and Science University Hospital.

He suffers with a genetic kidney 
disease which rules out donation from family members so he is dependent 
on a stranger offering him a kidney.

He is hopeful his unusual publicity drive could bring the right person forward.

'I just need a kidney.' Earl Martinez 
told Koinlocal6. 'My insurance would cover all medical costs on my side and
the donors side. The donor would have no medical costs at all.'

Martinez has attracted the attention of those passing his spot at Southwest 185th and via a campaign Facebook page.

As a result dozens of people from the across the country have offered their kidneys despite having never met him before.

Elisa Judy Lantigua-Rivas wrote on the
Earl Needs a Kidney Facebook page: 'I live in Florida, but would be 
more than willing to travel to Portland if so needed. Regardless of how 
this plays out, you are in my prayers, and I sincerely hope to be able 
to chat with you. '

Sarah 
Macias Earl added:  'I am O rh negative, which I think they call a 
universal donor. I am 67 years old, a retired teacher. I live in 
northern Idaho which is not too far away. If my kidneys are healthy 
enough and they probably are... I do not drink, smoke, or do drugs. I am
planning on taking a trip from around Feb 12th to March 15, so let me 
know if I can help.'

Rachael
Navarro, another woman who has put herself forward as a donor, added: 
'All I can do is hope and pray that i can help you.'

Writing on the site on Sunday  Martinez, whose wife Ali Fleenor has just given birth to their third daughter, said: 'Thank you everyone for your support I never thought this was going to happen!'

Alport syndrome in an inherited illness which damages the blood vessels of the kidneys

Organ donation by strangers is becoming more and more common.

The National Kidney Registry reported a record 60 person donation chain last year with 30 people giving their kidneys to 30 strangers in order to get a kidney for a relative they had who was in need of a donation.
