There may still be more to come in the Darren Wilson case. 

Just days after the Department of Justice released the findings of their probe into the shooting of Michael Brown by Wilson, an officer with the Ferguson Police Department, a member of the Missouri grand jury that decided not to indict Wilson has filed a memorandum hoping to speak publicly about the case.

And among other things, the juror claims that Robert McCulloch, the attorney who prosecuted the case, lied to the public.

An individual filed papers on Friday claiming the prosecutor in the Darren Wilson case, Robert McCulloch (above), misled jurors and lied to the public

The juror says during the Wilson (above) case, McCulloch made it seem as throughout officer was right to shoot Michael Brown

The 21-page memorandum, filed ,on Friday, states that McCulloch was not truthful when during a press conference immediately following the decision he said that 'all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges.' 

This is just one of the reasons why the juror is asking to be able to speak out about the case.

In Missouri, only nine of the twelve jurors are need to make the decision on whether or not to indict an individual. 

'This case is about Doe’s First Amendment rights,' said the lawyer for the unnamed juror. 

'The claim that a citizen with information on a matter of public concern should be permitted to challenge the government’s narrative without going to jail is a cognizable First Amendment claim.'

The papers says McCulloch was not being truthful when he announced the jury all jurors decided not to indict Wilson for shooting Brown (above)

The lawyer also noted; 'McCulloch speaks freely and purportedly openly about the very content about which Doe wishes to speak, just from a different viewpoint.' 

The juror is also claiming in these papers that McCulloch presented evidence over the course of the trial that suggested Brown was the aggressor and Wilson did nothing wrong and was simply acting in self-defense.

'McCulloch has given his view of the grand jurors’ thoughts. The twelve who know the answer are silenced by the challenged laws,' said the juror's attorney.
