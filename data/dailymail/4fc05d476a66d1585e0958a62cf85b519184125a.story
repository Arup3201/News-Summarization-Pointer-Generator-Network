They say opposites attract, but that doesn’t seem to be the case for beauty pageant winners Ruby Bowater and Jordan Williams, who are arguably the best-looking couple in Britain.

Ruby, 19, from Dudley, is Miss West Midlands and has been dating Mr England Jordan, 26, from Nuneaton, Warks, for five months.

The genetically-blessed pair now hope to develop their modelling careers as a 'power couple'.

Is this the UK's best-looking couple? Stunning Miss West Midlands Ruby Bowater, 19, from Dudley, has been dating Mr England, Jordan Williams, 26, from Nuneaton, Warks, for five months

Size six Ruby, who works for MAC Cosmetics, is vying for a place in the Miss England competition so she can stand alongside her man.

However Ruby says she was wary of dating the hunk at first.

‘When I first met Jordan last year it was on the pageant circuit and he was always trying to have banter and chat to me, but I was wary because I thought he might have been a bit of player,’ she says.

'There are always lots of stunning girls around the Miss England events and I thought he might have had a wandering eye.

‘But I kept bumping into him and he asked me go for dinner, so I decided to take a chance on him and we went out for food and got on really well.

Sweet couple: Jordan, left, who works as a Michael Buble tribute act, said of his girlfriend Ruby: 'I have never been much of a relationship man, but with Ruby it is different'

'It’s so nice that he understands what it is like to be in the paegent world.

‘I was a bit worried what some of the other contestants would think when they heard me and Jordan were a couple, but everyone has been really supportive.’

Their love affair blossomed from their first date and a week later Ruby agreed to accompany Jordan on a trip to London where, like the doting girlfriend that she is, held his hand while he had his teeth whitened.

Jordan, who works as a Michael Buble tribute act, said: ‘I have never been much of a relationship man, but with Ruby it is different.

‘We just get on so well and she completely understands what I have to do.

‘We support each other and would love to work together in the future - it would be great to be as big as Posh and Becks.’

Ruby adds: ‘I don’t get jealous and he is really good too because he understands exactly what it’s like.

‘It would be so nice to be the first Miss and Mr England that are a couple. It would make us the ultimate power couple.’
