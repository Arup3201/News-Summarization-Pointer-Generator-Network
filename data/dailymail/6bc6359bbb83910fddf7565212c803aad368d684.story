Spacewalks are one of the most impressive and dangerous feats an astronaut can perform on the ISS.

Fixing critical components often involves lengthy stints outside the spacecraft, with a spacesuit acting as the only barrier between an astronaut and lethal radiation.

But this could soon be a thing of the past. The space station's Canadian robotic arm, dubbed Canadarm2, is currently attempting to fix itself without any help from a human.

Dextre, which was sent to the space station in 2008, has arms more than 9.8 feet (3 metres) in length and has  power tools as fingers. Together, Dextre and Canadarm2 make up the space station's robotic Mobile Servicing System, making this the first ever robot self-repair service in space

Canadarm2’s multi-limbed robotic helper, called Dextre, is in the process of a week-long repair job to move and fix old cameras.

Dextre has arms that are more than 9.8 feet (3 metres) in length which can attach to power tools that act like its fingers.

Together, Dextre and Canadarm2 make up the space station's robotic Mobile Servicing System, making this the first ever robot self-repair service in space.

The robots are controlled remotely from the Canadian Space Agency headquarters in Longueuil, Quebec, and Nasa’s Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.

Dextre is moving a camera on Canadarm2 to the mobile base to replace a completely broken camera. It will then install a new, spare camera on the Canadarm2.

The cameras are part of an 11-strong set on the Mobile Servicing System that perform surveys outside the space station.

Dextre's role is to keep the International Space Station (ISS) in working order. 

Having Dextre on call will reduce the amount of risky spacewalks, giving astronauts more time for science,

Dextre’s special skills and unique location outside the ISS offers an opportunity for space agencies to test ground for new robotics concepts like servicing satellites in space. 

The robot can ride on the end of Canadarm2 to move from worksite to worksite, or hitch a ride on the Mobile Base System.

The space handyman is currently in the process of a week-long repair job to move and fix old cameras on Canadarm2.

The astronauts' only involvement in the operation was to push the spare camera into an airlock so Dextre could grab it.

While this is the first time a robotic repair task like this has been performed, Mathieu Caron, mission control supervisor at the Canadian Space Agency, told CBCNews.Ca it won’t be the last.

‘Using the Canadarm2 and Dextre reduces the overall number of spacewalks, definitely,’ he said.

‘Spacewalks are very complex and use a lot of space station resources.

‘They monopolise astronauts not only for the duration of the spacewalk, but in the weeks leading up to it for all their preparation.’

However, Dextre has some of its own drawbacks that it still needs to overcome. For instance, it can currently only deal with ‘robotically compatible’ bolts and screws.

CSO is now working to make the system more flexible. It added that Dextre is due to replace a circuit breaker in June and to repair equipment outside the space station to prepare for some astronaut spacewalks later in the summer.
