This is the bizarre sight of thousands of videos which have been dumped on farmland by suspected flytippers.

The unwanted collection of 10,000 tapes includes everything from James Bond through to Bob the Builder - and a Carol Vorderman fitness video.

The owners of the farm in Darlington, County Durham, have no idea who abandoned the videos.

Jo Robinson, 37, and her husband Simon, 48, said they will have to pay to have the videos removed and they are blocking entry to a field. They were abandoned on Headlam Hall Farm last Thursday evening.

Jo said: 'Lots of people had seen the videos and we were getting all kinds of texts and phone calls.

'On the Friday morning Simon and I drove out to have a look and I could not believe it, it was so strange.

'Around 10,000 videos had been dumped. I have no idea where they have come from. But it looks like there are too many for them to have originated from a market stall.

'They were all sliding out of cardboard boxes which had been soaked in rain. One box read "three videos for a pound" on the side.'

The couple contacted Blockbuster wondering if they had paid an unreliable contractor to dispose of the videos, but were told this was not the case.

Jo added: 'The videos are all in really good condition. There is a Carol Vorderman exercise video and a Bob the Builder.

'My nephew has claimed a James Bond box set. A couple of people have offered to help us move the videos, but it will be a good day's work, there are just so many of them.

'I have never seen so many videos before, not even in a shop.'

Jo said that she had contacted the council but had been told there would be a charge for the removal of the films.

She has also reported the appearance of the videos to the police.
