When a Mississippi man's wife of more than 60 years passed away, he, naturally, received words of comfort from family and friends. But, along with the condolences from loved ones, came words from his wife herself.

Days after she died, Billie Breland's family found a touching note she left to her husband, James Breland, letting him know that they would meet again.

In a post from Cliff Sims, an Alabama journalist, on Yellowhammer News, Sims shared the touching note the family found written by his grandmother, Billie, to his grandfather, James, tucked into her checkbook just days after her death.

Note: Just two days after Billie's death, her family found a note she wrote for her husband to help him cope with her death 

In the post, Sims explained that his 'Mimi' Billie suffered a broken hip and was unable to fully recover.

'Every day my Grandaddy stayed by her side in the hospital taking care of her, just as he'd done for every one of the 60 years they'd been married — right up until the night she passed,' Sims wrote.

He explained that his 83-year-old grandmother, who had been a public school teacher, was an 'avid note writer,' according to Yellowhammer.

Sims wrote that his grandmother would leave notes around her Cleveland, MS home of funny things that happened or quotes she wanted to remember.

'We don't know exactly when she did it, but she left one final note tucked inside her checkbook — but this one wasn't for her, it was for my Grandaddy,' Sims wrote.

The note reads: 'Please don't cry because I died! Smile because I lived! Know that I'm in a happy place! Know that we will meet again! I will see you there!'

Pain: Sims wrote that Billie always thought of others before herself and the note was a way to ease her husband's pain

Billie: Sims wrote that the note, written in Billie's (center) perfect cursive handwriting, 'perfectly sums up the hope and comfort that comes with knowing you’ll meet again in eternity'

Sims wrote that Billie always thought of others before herself and the note was a way to ease her husband's pain. 

Billie passed away Tuesday, Jan. 13 and her family found her heartfelt note just two days later. Billie and James married in 1954, according to Sims.

Sims wrote that the note, written in Billie's perfect cursive handwriting, 'perfectly sums up the hope and comfort that comes with knowing you’ll meet again in eternity.'
