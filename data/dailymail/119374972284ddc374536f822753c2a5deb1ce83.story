A hockey commentator has been forced to apologize after offending viewers with a joke about the national police brutality protests. 

Stan Savran was reporting about the Pittsburgh Penguins game against the Columbus Blue Jackets on ROOT Sports Saturday night, when he referenced the 'I Can't Breathe' shirts athletes like LeBron James and Kobe Bryant have been wearing to games to protest the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. 

Garner died after being put in an illegal chokehold by an NYPD officer in Staten Island, and his last words of 'I can't breathe' have now become a rally cry at protests around the nation.

Serious subject: Savran (left) said the Penguins should have worn 'I Can't Breathe' shirts since they crippled to the pressure of the Columbus Blue Jackets.

Savran caused offense when he took the very serious issue and turned it into a sports analogy while commenting on the Penguins 3-4 loss.

'I thought Jay the Penguins would have to put on those "I Can’t Breathe" T-shirts for a while, because Columbus was suffocating,' Savran said. 

Co-host Jay Caufield clearly didn't see the joke coming, since he looked visibly shocked at the reference and didn't address the line as he proceeded ahead in the game analysis. 

Shortly after the show, Savran quickly issued an apology for his choice of words.  

'I can't express how sorry I am for my mindless comment. Certainly wasn't intended to make light of a tragic situation. Totally unacceptable and just plain stupid. It's [NOT] how I've conducted myself during my career. Again, I apologize and hope you can forgive me.' 

While Savran's initial comments sparked outrage on Twitter, many were forgiving of the sports reporter due to his quick apology.  

'For a guy who never makes mistakes, Stan Savran made a bonehead last night. But it wasn't malicious. Apology should suffice,' user @PittBahhb tweeted.

Surprised: Savran's co-host Jay Caufield was clearly taken aback when the 'I Can't Breathe' joke was made. He did not address the line, and proceeded on with the conversation
