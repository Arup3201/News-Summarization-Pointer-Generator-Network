Brendan Rodgers' decision to rest Steven Gerrard failed to pay dividends as even the Liverpool captain's emergence off the bench failed to inspire his side to break down a resolute Sunderland. Sportsmail's Dominic King rated the players' performances at Anfield. 

Liverpool (4-2-3-1)

Simon Mignolet - 6.5

A clean sheet against his old club. Wasn't subjected to the kind of pressure that might have exposed his brittle confidence.

Glen Johnson - 7

Lost possession at one point in the first half but, other than that, he was solid throughout and did all that was all that was asked of him.

Martin Skrtel - 6.5

Not given a moment to relax by Altidore. A couple of rash challenges before the break but, otherwise, steady in the man.

Raheem Sterling was a bright spot in a disappointing display by Liverpool

Kolo Toure - 7

Hasn't given Dejan Lovren any suggestion he will relinquish his place any time soon. The pick of Liverpool's defence, even if he looked to be carrying a groin problem.

Alberto Moreno - 6

Likes to make his presence felt in the opposite half of the field, as one surge in the second half proved, but can be careless when doing the job he is paid to.

Lucas - 7

Neat and tidy, protected the defence with his usual reliability. Had one shot in the second half that Pantilimon comfortably saved.

Jordan Henderson - 6

Usual hard work and covered plenty of miles but some of his passing in the second half lacked zip and he didn't get involved as much as he would have liked.

Adam Lallana - 5.5

A skilful player, for sure, but this was not a game for him to remember. Action tended to pass him by and he eventually made way for Gerrard. 

Liverpool defender Glen Johnson put in a solid performance on Saturday

Philippe Coutinho - 5.5

Had two shots on target, either side of the break, and some of his trickery was impressive. But, again, he flattered to deceive and failed to see the game out.

Raheem Sterling - 7.5

The man most likely to find a breakthrough for long with his speed on the breaking and dancing feet. Gradually getting back to the standards he set himself.

Rickie Lambert - 6

Not quite at the level he had shown in previous games. No faulting his commitment and had a first half header saved but no other chances followed.

Subs 

Gerrard (for Lallana 65mina) 7; Markovic (for Coutinho 77mins) Unused Jones (GK), Enrique, Lovren, Can, Allen 

Steven Gerrard came on as late sub but he was unable to help Liverpool grab a winner

Sunderland (4-1-4-1)

Costel Pantilimon - 7

Did everything that was asked of him; handled the ball with confidence and saved everything that was thrown his way. Confident display of goalkeeping.

Santiago Vergini - 6.5

Had the trouble of trying to contain Sterling; got booked for one foul but otherwise solid and played his part in getting a point.

John O'Shea - 7.5

Led by example and cruised through the game, won his headers and kept the back four organised. A thoroughly professional display.

Wes Brown - 7

One anxious moment late on when he tangled with Sterling but, in the main, he was never over-exerted trying to keep Lambert at arms' length.

Anthony Reveillere - 7

Did all that was asked of him, providing bite on the left hand side of Sunderland's defence. Even when Sterling switched flanks he remained composed.

Liam Bridcutt - 8

His outstanding afternoon was summed up when he flung himself in front of a shot from Henderson; ran himself to a standstill to protect his defence.

Sunderland striker Conor Wickham put himself about and went close to breaking the deadlock

Adam Johnson - 5.5

On the periphery, didn't provide any guile when it mattered. No surprise when his afternoon was brought to a premature end.

Sebastian Larsson - 6

Performed a diligent role but wasn't always accurate with the range of his passing and his normally accurate set pieces lacked precision.

Jordi Gomez - 6.5

Worked hard and there were no frills but he had the first shot of the game that flashed wide and contributed to what was a stoic Sunderland performance.

Conor Wickham - 6.5

Always involved, had a couple of shouts for penalty in the first half and then thrashed a volley wide after the break. It was the best chance of the game.

Jozy Altidore - 5.5

A physical presence who tried to bulldoze his way past Skrtel and Toure but never threatened to find a way past Mignolet and was eventually withdrawn.

Subs 

Alvarez (for Altidore 70mins 5), Buckley (for Johnson 79mins), Cattermole (for Larsson 70mins 5) Unused Mannone (GK), Rodwell, Fletcher, Robson
