Normally all eyes are on the court during Wimbledon fortnight, but there may be a rival distraction in the royal box.

The Duchess of Cambridge has accepted honorary membership of the All England Club, I can disclose.

Though with a royal baby due in July Kate is unlikely to be ringside this year, I gather she is thrilled by the offer. Sporty Kate is a decent player — though not as good as sister Pippa — and she is already an honorary member of the rival Queen’s Club in West London.

Tennis fan: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured with Prince William at Wimbledon in 2012, has been a regular at the Royal Box in Centre Court in the past few years

Kate and William were court side for Andy Murray's London 2012 quarterfinal match held at Wimbledon where they did a Mexican wave

Last summer Kate was a regular at the tennis, cheering on Andy Murray all the way to the final.

Though he lost out to Roger Federer, she was back the following month to watch the Scot get his revenge in the Olympic final.

Some will see her decision to accept the offer — U.S. player Andy Roddick, who has won Grand Slam titles but never Wimbledon,  has also been granted honorary status — as the start of her relationship with the club.

Many believe she will be invited to succeed the Duke of Kent,  77, as club president when he decides to stand down.

Certainly her presence at the championships has boosted the sport.

A Palace spokeswoman says: ‘The Duchess was pleased to accept the kind offer, particularly given her interest in tennis.’
