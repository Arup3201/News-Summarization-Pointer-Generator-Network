Britain still has a chronic shortage of doctors – and experts warn that the situation is putting patients’ lives at risk.

Despite recruitment drives, the UK has one of the lowest numbers of practising medics per head in the EU.

Only Ireland, Slovenia, Romania and Poland have fewer physicians, a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found.

Shortage: Britain has one of the lowest doctor-to-patient ratios in the EU, says a new report (file photo)

Britain has 2.8 doctors per thousand people – less than the EU average of 3.4 and below other major economies including Germany, Italy and France.

Even former Communist states such as Lithuania and the Czech Republic have a greater proportion and Greece has more than twice as many doctors per head than the UK.

Experts say the shortage in the NHS is most acute among GPs and A&E doctors.

Last night Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, warned the shortage was risking patients.

‘When you have shortages of doctors in some areas it means longer waits,’ he said. ‘In A&E that’s not really an option, so it means doctors work harder and harder; it means there is a greater chance of mistakes, and ultimately it means risks to lives.

‘This has been going on the last three or four years – we cannot carry on like this.’ 

Long wait: A&E departments are under strain

The report found that the number of doctors in the UK has increased more rapidly than in any other EU country since 2000, rising by over 50 per cent between 2000 and 2012.

The rise was set in train by the Labour government, but has continued under the Tories even since the economic crash.

‘As a result, the United Kingdom had 2.8 practising physicians per 1000 population in 2012, up from 2.0 in 2000,’ the OECD report said.

‘This nonetheless remains below the EU average of 3.4 doctors per 1000 population.

‘While most of the increase in the number of doctors in the United Kingdom in the early 2000s came from the entry of foreign-trained doctors, the situation changed just before the economic crisis with most of the increase now driven by a strong rise in the number of graduates from domestic medical education programmes.

‘This reflects a deliberate policy in the United Kingdom to reduce its reliance on foreign-trained doctors to meet its own needs.’

Britain’s proportion of doctors – 2.8 per 1,000 head of population in 2012 – is much lower, however, than Greece on 6.2, Austria on 4.9 and Lithuania on 4.4.

Among our major European partners, Germany’s rate is 4.0, Italy is on 3.9, Spain is 3.8 and France is on 3.3. The EU average is 3.4 per 1,000 population.

Only four countries are below us – with the lowest being Poland on just 2.2.

The OECD said Britain’s rapid rise over the past decade had led to fears that doctors were being trained in the wrong specialisms – meaning they may have to be lain off in future years.

‘A growing number of doctors will improve access to health care, but will also put pressure on future health care budgets as more graduates enter the medical workforce,’ the report said.

‘There are now concerns that there might be surpluses of certain categories of doctors in the years ahead. This has led to recommendations to reduce slightly student intakes in medical schools or post-graduate training for certain specialties.’

Dr Mann, from the College of Emergency Medicine, added: ‘We have been warning for some years that we have got fewer doctors than most parts of the developed world.

‘When there aren’t enough doctors to go round, they can pick and choose speciality and because of the levels of burnout in A&E, that means many are walking away, creating even greater shortages.

‘We have now got 500 A&E doctors trained in this country working in Australia – that’s the equivalent of two full years of trained doctors.

Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association, said: ‘The NHS is under incredible pressure from rising patient demand and flat-lining funding.

‘The government’s announcement of additional resources in the autumn statement for the NHS is a step in the right direction, but it will not solve the long term under-doctoring of many parts of the NHS that is hindering patient care.

‘Key specialities such as emergency care and GP services are facing particularly acute shortages.’
