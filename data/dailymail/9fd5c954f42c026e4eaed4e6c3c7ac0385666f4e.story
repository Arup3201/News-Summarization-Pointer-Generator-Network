Archaeologists have discovered a leopard trap used by hunters 5,000-years-ago in Israel.

Israeli researchers originally thought the trap, which was found in the Negev Desert, was just a few hundred years old, as almost identical devices were used by Bedouins living in the region in the last century.

Scientists believe the type of trap, which to non-experts might look like a pile of stones, was used to catch carnivores, possibly by people living in the area who first kept herds of goats and sheep.

Naomi Porat, a geochronologist with the Geological Survey of Israel, said: 'The most exciting thing is the antiquity of these carnivore traps, which is totally unexpected.'

The trap was found alongside a younger, 1,600-year-old construction and the findings published in the journal Antiquity.

There are thought to be at least 50 similar traps in the Negev Desert, which merge into the rocky landscape, Live Science reported.

Dr Porat said: 'They look like a pile of stones, like a cairn, and you need a good eye and also some digging around to realise what it is.'

The trap from the 'closed side' in the desert. It works by a person attaching a piece of meat to the end of a rope to entice a leopard into the stoney box, tripping the heavy door shut and trapping the animal inside

The basic trap works by a person attaching a piece of meat to the end of a rope to entice a leopard into the stoney box, tripping the heavy door shut and trapping the fierce animal inside.

There is a deliberate opening on one side of the trap and large slabs of stone form the roof of the chamber, which is around 60 centimetres high.

The archaeologists optically dated the most recently discovered traps and compared the amount of radiation absorbed over the millennia to determine their ages.

The age range of the traps, that were 5,000 and 1,600 year's old, suggests that the method of trapping the animal has been used for thousands of years and must be fairly effective.

Scientists believe no leopards live in the Negev Desert now as habitat loss decimated their populations. The last one was spotted around a decade ago

Both were found near sites of ancient enclosures use by early goat and sheep herders living 6,000-years-ago who were presumably concerned with protecting their flocks.

The site is close to the Uvda Valley, where numerous Chalcolithic and Early Bronze sites were found.

It is thought the traps also managed to entice other predators living in the Middle East, including wolves, hyenas and long-eared cats.
