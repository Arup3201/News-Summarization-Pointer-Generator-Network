David Moyes chalked up his first big win in Spain on Sunday night by beating the mighty Barcelona. He is not yet two months in to his La Liga adventure but the signs are that he can be a success in San Sebastian. Sportsmail looks at the story so far...

Beating Barca as a springboard

Still beaming after Sunday night’s win, Moyes admitted post-match: ‘When we scored after two minutes I turned to my assistant Billy McKinlay and said: "We could do with the final whistle coming now". It was backs-against-the-walls stuff for most of the game but the resilience, intensity and defensive organisation that he has tried to instil in his new charges was there for all to see.

The temptation from the club president Jokin Aperribay will now be not to spend in the January transfer market with the club very keen to make the most of its excellent youth system. But Moyes stressed on Sunday night: 'We need to add quality if we want to be at the top end of the table. I love the philosophy of the club and want to work within that but you also need experience.'

The changes he has made

The first thing he noticed upon turning up in the Basque country last November was that the players were not fit. After a shambolic pre-season, not helped by having to play Europa League qualifiers, the players were not ready for the rigours of a tough season. 

‘It’s not something you can change in the middle of a campaign,’ he said. ‘People will notice the difference in the coming months and definitely next season.’

He will have been delighted with how well they held out on Sunday night after fading badly in the second half of many games since he took over. He will also have been delighted with the defensive organisation. He can be seen, on the usually cold and wet training pitches of Zubieta, pulling his defenders into position as part of the defensive drills he has leaned heavily upon since his arrival to bring some order to the team. Apart from a nightmare second half against Villarreal when they conceded four, the side have been very hard to score against under Moyes.

Moyes has put in plenty of work in on the training pitch and Sociedad are beginning to reap the benefits

Settling in

He is still staying in the city’s Maria Cristina hotel which overlooks the Uruma river as it meets the Atlantic (hence no rush to find permanent accommodation) but he is keen to pick out a family home as he puts down roots in one of the most picturesque regions of Spain. It rains a lot and it stays colder than most other parts of the peninsula so there is no beating sun to hide from.

Moyes wants to make the often inclement conditions at the club’s Anoeta Stadium part of Real Sociedad’s armoury – other teams don’t want to visit northern Spain; Barcelona didn’t much fancy the 9pm kick-off on Sunday and Moyes sees that as a potential advantage.

Talking a good game

He is taking lessons but the enormity of learning another language aged 51 when you are also a full-time football manager has already hit home. Pep Guardiola had a German teacher shadow him for the six months that led up to him taking the reins at Bayern Munich, Carlo Ancelotti locked himself away for several weeks before beginning his English adventure at Chelsea and others like Jose Mourinho have been fluent in other languages since school age.

Moyes is determined but it will not be easy. His ‘dos, tres, cuatro times’ press conference effort became an internet hit and he also shouted out ‘Stefano!’ when there is no such player at Real Sociedad during his first match. But the main thing is that he is making the effort and the effort is being appreciated. Many of Real Sociedad’s players speak English. Former QPR midfielder Esteban Granero has already told Sportsmail that Moyes’ English is easier to understand that Harry Redknapp’s so there seems to be no great communication problem. A translator is at Moyes’ side during training sessions and press officer Luis Arconada (son of the great Spain and Real Sociedad goalkeeper) is also fluent and constantly on hand to help the new manager.

What the future holds

He has already stressed the priority is to pull away from the bottom and not be in a relegation dog-fight at the end of the season. But he is always well aware that only last season La Real were playing in the Champions League so he needs to push them back towards the top four as soon as possible. To do that he will need to be allowed to bring in quality this January. 

The club are very keen to use its excellent B-team youth side Sanse. Moyes buys into the philosophy because he knows it well from his Everton days but he is also keen to be allowed to go out and get a Tim Cahill or Mikel Arteta just to add that extra touch of quality and experience.

Moyes is hoping that the San Sebastian club will back him in the transfer market during the January window
