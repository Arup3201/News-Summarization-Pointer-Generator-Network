A sexy politician has made waves in her homeland after revealing photos of her appeared in a tabloid paper.

Vanja Hadzovic, 27, an adviser in the ministry of foreign affairs, is planning a life as a career diplomat.

But the photos of her in the daily Blic have ruffled feathers among her superiors in the ministry.

‘There are those both within and outside Serbia who might think these pictures are not suitable for a woman who is hoping to excel at diplomacy,’ said one foreign ministry source.

Vanja, who holds a degree in management in media, has refused to comment on the photos that exploded across the Internet on Monday.

Her boss at the foreign ministry, Serbia's foreign secretary Ivan Mrkic, says she will find herself at the centre of a government probe.

He said it was also important to remember that she was in training and held no diplomatic status as of yet.  Although sources said the ministry is embarrassed by what has happened, he defended her right to pose and put the images on social networking sites.

‘To appear on social networks is the right of every individual. But our employees of the ministry of foreign affairs need to act according to the code of conduct on these networks. The employee that was mentioned has shut down her profiles on these networks,’ the minister added.

He also praised her as a person who ‘conscientiously carries out her everyday duties’.

In the past Vanja Hadzovic used to be the vice president of the youth arm of the Socialist Party - the party once led by war crimes suspect and late Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.
