West Bromich Albion are interested in West Ham winger Matt Jarvis. 

The Baggies have been told to increase their £4million bid for Parma winger Jonathan Biabiany to £8m but are looking for alternatives more suited to their price range. 

Jarvis has struggled to recapture the form he showed at Wolves and West Ham will listen to offers.
