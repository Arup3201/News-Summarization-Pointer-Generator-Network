Palermo starlet Paulo Dybala has revealed he'd 'swim to Barcelona' to secure a move, if the Catalan giants came calling for his signature.

The 21-year-old has been in sensational form for the Serie A side this term, netting 12 goals in 24 league appearances, and it hasn't gone unnoticed.

Manchester United, Manchester City, Juventus, Napoli and Borussia Dortmund have all shown an interest in the highly-rated youngster, with Barcelona also believed to be keen on Dybala.

When asked by Radio Belgrano  if he'd be interested in a move to the Spanish giants in particular Dybala answered honestly: 'Would I be open to a move to Barcelona? I would swim to Barcelona if they came knocking.

'I wouldn't even have to change into my swimming gear. After all, I would only have to cross the Mediterranean Sea.'

Just last month in an interview with Italian sport magazine Guerin Sportivo, Dybala admitted he had aspirations of playing for Luis Enrique's men, as well as Premier League champions City.

He said: 'When I play with the Playstation, I always choose Barcelona or Manchester City.

'I dream to play one day with one of those clubs.' 

Just last month Palermo club president Maurizio Zamparini dubbed Dybala - a £9million signing back in April 2012 - as the new Sergio Aguero.

Representatives of United were also present at Palermo's match against Inter Milan on February 8, as the interest in the Argentina forward continues to grow.
