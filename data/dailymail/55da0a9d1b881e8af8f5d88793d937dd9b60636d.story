Some 250 
missiles were launched from Gaza in revenge for yesterday's airstrike 
assassination of Hamas's top military commander

This is the scene of this morning's rocket attacks on a five-storey, dilapidated apartment block, that killed three people as they ate their breakfast.

The kitchen sink in the flat that suffered the direct hit is filled with the usual pots and pans, sitting in a masses of broken crockery and chunks of plaster that was blown over.

An upside down kettle lies beneath what looks like a broken part of a kitchen cupboard. A fridge lies overturned on its side, covered in rubble. If you stumbled across the room by accident, you would be forgiven for thinking that it had been abandoned for months, and not just since a fatal breakfast meeting that morning.

Devastation: An Israeli sapper inspects the damage in a house hit by a rocket fired by Palestinian militants into the southern Israeli city of Kiryat Malahi that killed three people

Thick grey dust covers everything except for the odd flash of a yellow dustpan, or a red cerial box.

In a room that resembles a bedroom, 
the mattresses are turned on their sides, springs are poking out and the
 legs of the bed base point sharply upwards at odd angles. The overhead 
lights have been blown off and are now swinging slowly on a flimsy wire 
from the ceiling.

The walls are cracked and are 
splashed in places with what looks like drying brown blood. Bright 
sunlight pours in through the giant hole where a fourth wall should have
 been - from here, you can see directly towards Gaza.

The tree branches outside the flat 
are no longer bare - clothing which was blown several metres from the 
flat now hang there. The ground is strewn with bits of metal, splintered
 wooden boards and items of clothing. Occasionally, bits of glass 
collapse from the window frames above and fall on the ground.

The Israeli army said some 250 
missiles were launched from Gaza in revenge for the airstrike 
assassination of Hamas's top military commander yesterday.

One young yeshiva student I met along
 the way said that he heard a loud blast 'as if it was happening just 
outside' and ran into the shelter in his seminary.

The
 residents of the apartment block that was hit had no such luxury. Arie 
Spekter, a resident of the second floor for the past year, said that the
 single shelter room for the 16 flats is downstairs and stuffed full of 
people's belongings.

'The flats are very small here and people need all they storage space they can get,' he says.

When the rockets hit there was nowhere to run. Mr Spekter has bloodshot eyes and is holding his 11-year-old daughter Dina close to him.

'I'd just finished a night shift, and came home and wanted to relax,' he says. 'As soon as the alarms started we woke up.

'We opened the doors and gathered the neighbour's children in our flat so that they would be safe from this side.

Mr Spekter said that safety was the first issue on his mind when he moved into the flat.

'I specifically asked for a flat on the side facing away from Gaza. Thank god I did that.'

I
 follow him inside the apartment. On the second floor, all the windows 
have been blown away. On the fifth, instead a wall is a blasted hole, 
approximately four metres square.

The
 light pouring into the devastated room illuminates clothes, household 
utensils, pillows and blankets which are scattered around, everything 
discoloured by the thick grey dust still falling from the ceiling. In 
the corner lies a still unopened plastic packet of baby clothing.

'My wife wants to go to Rehovot,' Mr Spekter tells his friend on the phone.

'I
 don't want to go, I want to run!' shouts his wife. She is in a state of
 shock, at times talking calmly, and then suddenly crying shrilly. 'I'm 
so angry! I want them all to burn in hell, the Arabs, for what they did 
to us.'

Attack: A rocket is launched from Gaza as seen from Sderot. The Israeli army said some 200 rockets had been fired today from Gaza

Fear: A woman dives for cover as a siren sounds warning of incoming rockets in Kiryat Malachi

Later on, she curls up on the sofa and covers her head with her arms.

'What's remarkable is that I'm more angry with the Israeli government than with the Arabs', says Mr Spekter.

'This is all due to elections. The politicians always tell us 'we have shelters, we're protected...but we're not!'

Gilad Erdon, a member of parliament from PM Netanyahu's Likkud party, and minister of environmental protection arrived on the scene in the late afternoon.

When asked how it was possible that residents in this building had no safe shelter, he replied 'It's almost impossible to protect our citizens 100 per cent, especially in areas such as this, where families live with many children in cramped conditions.

'I've been inside - some people even live in the balcony, with not even a window to protect them. Twenty per cent of Israel's total budget goes on security and defence of the country - unfortunately, this still is not enough.'

Another neighbour from the next street, Yosef Ladayo, an ultra-Orthodox resident in his 60s, describes how his daughter could not sleep because of the alarms.

Horror: Israelis take cover as rockets fly overhead

'She was so scared,' he says.

A yeshiva student called Arik said: Until it happens, you don't believe it ever will.'

Onlookers and neighbours are gathered outside.

'I'm standing here and I'm still scared in case there's another alarm. Where can we be safe?' asks Maya from Tajikistan who has been a resident here over the past 20 years.

When asked if she would consider moving, she shrugs and throws up her hands.

'Where would I move to?,' she says. 'In America there are storms and floods. Tel Aviv is also within range of the rockets now. They've already hit Hadera. Where is there to go to?'

Some time in the late afternoon, two 
more explosions are heard.

Although they sound far away, a woman 
screams. A little boy, no more than 7 years old sitting huddled up 
holding his pet turtle. He asks quietly, 'mama, will you protect me?' A 
neighbour comes in and tries to reassure everyone - "they never hit the 
same building twice".

People want to leave their houses, at least for a few days, but are worried about losing their jobs.
