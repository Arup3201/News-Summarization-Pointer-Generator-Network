A woman has been arrested after allegedly stabbing her cousin's pet cat to death following an argument.

Tish Coleman, who was said to be 'covered in blood' when she was arrested in Chicago, U.S., on Friday, was found with a bloodstained Swiss Army knife in her purse, police said.

The 31-year-old is accused of attacking the animal after fighting with her cousin at the apartment they share in the Woodlawn neighbourhood.

Coleman allegedly hit her 26-year-old cousin in the face and tore her shirt when an argument broke out between the pair at around 8pm on Friday night, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune.

Coleman's cousin managed to push the woman outside and shut the door, but she continued to create a disturbance outside on the porch, prosecutors said.

When another woman entered the apartment through the porch door a short time later, the cat ran outside.

Coleman and the cat were gone when her cousin went outside a few minutes later, court documents said.

The 26-year-old then found her pet, which had brown and white spots, lying bleeding on the landing of the building's stairwell.

The one-year-old cat had puncture wounds on its left side.

Police arrested Coleman about a block from the apartment. When questioned about what had happened, she is said to have told officers: 'I did nothing to the cat'.

A Swiss Army pocket knife found in Coleman's purse had blood on the blade, police said.

She is charged with felony aggravated cruelty to an animal and misdemeanour domestic battery.

Judge Isreal Desierto ordered her held on $75,000 bond, the report said.

A Chicago Police Department 
spokeswoman said Coleman had been arrested in the past on charges of 
battery, simple assault and criminal damage to property.
