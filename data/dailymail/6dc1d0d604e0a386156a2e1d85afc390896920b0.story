Prince William's Royal Standard flew at half mast as he presided over a medal ceremony hours after making a heartfelt tribute to Nelson Mandela.

The flag was lowered in tribute to the South Africa's first black president as the Duke of Cambridge honoured soldiers who have returned from Afghanistan.

Today's ceremony came after the Duke and Duchess attended the premiere of a film about Mr Mandela's life last night, unaware of his death until the end.

As he left the cinema, the ashen-faced Duke said: 'I just wanted to say it's extremely 
sad and tragic news. We were just reminded what an extraordinary and 
inspiring man Nelson Mandela was.

All smiles: The Duke of Cambridge shared a joke with members of the Irish Guards in Aldershot, Hampshire

'My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. It's very sad.'

Prince William presented operational service medals today to 120 members of No. 2 Company, 1st Battalion Irish Guards, of which he is Colonel.

Friends and family of the soldiers, who returned from Helmand Province in October after a six-month tour, watched as the ceremony took place in bright sunshine at Mons Barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire.

Prince William 
told the men: 'You did your job magnificently, helping the people of 
Helmand to face their future with greater security and confidence, and 
you all came home safe and sound.

'This speaks greatly of your professionalism and to your care for one another.

1st Battalion Irish Guards returned from Afghanistan last month with no fatalities, but some injuries

'We are extremely proud of you, and glad beyond words that you are safely home.'

No soldiers died on the tour, but some suffered injuries.

The Duke briefly met some of the soldiers and their families.

No. 2 Company commander Major Jonathan Palmer said: 'It was fantastic, particularly for the families.

'To have, what you might call, some royal stardust is a vindication of the sacrifices they have made.'

The officer said that it was the professionalism and training of his men that ensured all of them came home, but he said that on several occasions it had been 'a close call'.
