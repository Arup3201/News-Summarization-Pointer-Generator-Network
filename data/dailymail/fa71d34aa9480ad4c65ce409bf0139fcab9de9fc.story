It got off to an uncertain start, with viewers complaining of dull, confusing plot lines.

And it seems things have gone from bad to worse for BBC2’s new drama Wolf Hall, after it lost one million viewers in the space of a week.

Wednesday night’s episode, which was the second instalment of the Tudor drama, drew an average of 2.89 million viewers, down from the 3.89 million who tuned in to watch episode one.

Complex: The BBC historical drama Wolf Hall - starring Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell - has lost one million viewers in a week, with many who switched off saying they were left feeling confused by the complex plot and 'snail's pace action'

Like last week, many of those who did watch the historical saga, praised the cast, in particular Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell and Damian Lewis who stars as King Henry VIII. 

But others said the slow pace had sent them to sleep and complained there was too much complex Tudor history to make for entertaining viewing.

Praise: While viewers have been left in the dark by the complicated political plot, cast members such as Damian Lewis - who plays King Henry VIII - have earned praise for their powerful performances

University of Sheffield historian Catherine Fletcher used Twitter to share background notes throughout the episode, including: ‘One of Henry’s courtiers, Sir Francis Bryan, really did lose an eye while jousting. It was dangerous business.’ 

Responding to questions about Henry’s tangerine robes, she wrote: ‘Well Henry did like the colour - ordered more orange garments in 1530s & 1540s.’

However her expertise couldn’t help some of the more confused muddle through. 

Taking to the social media site, one viewer wrote: ‘Wolf Hall is proving to be a sure fire way to send me to sleep, the Tudors really didn’t say much!’

‘Cannot understand the love around Wolf Hall. Painfully slow and dull,’ wrote another, while a third posted: ‘Wolf Hall is so confusing.’

The BBC spent £7million making Wolf Hall, which is based on Hilary Mantel’s award-winning novel and charts the rise of Cromwell from blacksmith’s son to one of the most powerful men in King Henry VIII’s court.

The BBC spent £7million making Wolf Hall, which is based on Hilary Mantel’s award-winning novel and charts the rise of Cromwell from blacksmith’s son to one of the most powerful men in King Henry VIII’s court.  

Directed by Peter Kosminsky, adapting the text involved condensing nearly 700 pages into six one-hour episodes – helped by a combination of flashbacks and jumps forward. 

Author: Hilary Mantel, who won the Booker Prize for the novel in 2009

However, while this might help fit more of Mantel’s vision of Tudor England on the screen, some audience members were left less impressed.

And despite becoming BBC2’s most successful new drama for a decade when it began last week, it was met with complaints from viewers who complained the structure was hard to follow.

One Twitter user wrote: ‘Thinking about Wolf Hall; know my history, loved the books but still found the chopping and changing of the time line slightly confusing.’

And another said: ‘Wolf Hall? Confusing use of “he” for any 4 or 5 folk at a time, non-linear timeline, stupidly long convos & snail’s pace action.’

Others felt their lack of knowledge of Tudor history left them at a disadvantage when watching the programme.

In one sequence, Thomas Cromwell lost his wife and daughters to the mysterious ‘sweating sickness’.

The disease, which is still not fully understood, struck England and later Europe in a series of epidemics between 1485 and 1551. Speculation of its causes at the time included people’s sins, spells, and the French.

Although the disease does not exist today and is therefore rarely talked about, no time was spent giving audiences this context.

One viewer wrote: ‘What is sweating sickness? They weren’t feeling unwell the day before. Must be able to equate it to modern day illness.’

And another joked: ‘A dose of the sweating sickness would have been a blessed relief during Wolf Hall.’
