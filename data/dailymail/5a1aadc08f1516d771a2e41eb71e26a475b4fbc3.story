Foreign workers employed by arts and craft chain Hobbycraft have been told to speak English or face the sack.

Staff at the supplier's distribution warehouse in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, were hauled in for a meeting this week 
after difficulties arose with different nationalities conversing only in
 their native tongue.

Staff were told the firm’s policy was they should only use English during work hours and, if caught doing otherwise, they could be disciplined.

A Hobbycraft director said the move was to 'create a good working environment

Chris Fenlon, people director for Hobbycraft, said: 'Having the ability to speak English is part of the recruitment criteria in our distribution centre, however within the social areas colleagues can speak all languages

'Therefore, we do ask that during working hours in the warehouse colleagues speak English.

'This is to create a good working environment where all colleagues can communicate effectively.

But one Polish worker, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions, said that she thought the move was 'silly'.

She said: 'Our managers forbid us from speaking to others in any language but English.

Hobbycraft currently has 79 art and craft stores across the UK, he first store opened in Dorset in 1995

'The first few months were not that bad and, if they spotted someone using any other language, the person would basically get told off.

'But then all staff were called to the canteen to be told that we were only allowed to speak English while working and, if we do not, we will face punishment.

I know it sounds silly but I think it is something that is important and needs raising.'

However, the move could land bosses in hot water as Slater & Gordon law firm warns the policy could be indirectly discriminatory and could lead to compensation claims.

Claire Dawson, employment lawyer at the firm, said: ‘There would certainly be a potential claim for indirect racial discrimination.

‘Although this policy is going to apply to all staff obviously it will put staff who are not native English speakers at a disadvantage compared to those who are.

‘It would be natural for workers of the same nationality to speak to each other in the same language.

‘Where there are health and safety reasons requiring people to give clear instructions I can absolutely see there would be potential justification but to impose a blanket ban I think would be difficult to justify.’
