David Luiz showed he was back in a familiar place on Tuesday ahead of PSG's clash with Chelsea in the Champions League last-16 second leg on Wednesday night.

Luiz returns to Stamford Bridge having played there between 2011 and 2014, and is looking to spoil his former club's chances of reaching the next round.

The Brazil defender posted a photograph on his Instagram and wrote: 'Right time to be back! #LondonCity #Amazing #BigBen #BeautifulDay'.

Luiz posted the snap after warning Chelsea they won't achieve success by simply sitting back when the two sides meet.

The first leg of the Champions League tie ended 1-1, meaning a goalless draw would be enough to send Jose Mourinho's side through to the next round.

But Luiz feels it would be foolish of his old club to invite pressure on themselves, considering the strength of the Ligue 1 champions' attacking options. 

'I know how Jose (Mourinho) will prepare for this, he will be telling the boys to be patient and hit us on the counter attack,' Luiz told The Mirror.

'He knows that we need to score and that they don't, I know that is his way. We must be careful because I know that Chelsea have the ability to hurt on the counter attack, but they must be careful as well.

'To sit back and just defend against Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), (Edinson) Cavani and (Ezequiel) Lavezzi can also be very dangerous, so it is not just us who have to be careful.' 

Luiz spent three years in west London before his £50m summer transfer to the French champions
