Gerard Pique has put behind Spain's disastrous World Cup by hitting the poker tables of Las Vegas.

The Barcelona centre-back was pictured competing in the annual World Series of Poker at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino.

And it appeared to be going much better than his short spell in South America with ESPN's Andrew Feldman reporting that Pique was up 140,000 in tournament chips on Wednesday night.

Pique 
wasn't the only famous face competing in Las Vegas with Aussie cricket 
legend Shane Wane and the UFC's Martin Kampmann also involved.

Defending
 champions Spain were knocked out of the World Cup after just two 
matches, following defeats to the Netherlands and Chile.

Pique will soon return to club duties at Barcelona ahead of the start of the 2014-15 La Liga season on August 24.
