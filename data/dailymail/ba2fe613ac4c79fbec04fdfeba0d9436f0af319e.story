A Spanish nursing assistant who contracted Ebola after treating two priests who later died of the disease has been released from hospital. 

Teresa Romero, 44, was taken into isolation on October 6 after developing symptoms of the deadly virus. 

She contracted the virus after helping treat two Spanish missionaries who caught the disease while working in Liberia.

After receiving the experimental treatment, Ms Romero's condition improved dramatically 

She was the first person known to have contracted the disease outside of west Africa in the latest outbreak.

Hospital doctors said Ms Romero received various treatments, including blood plasma from an Ebola survivor, but were unable to say if any had been effective.

Ms Romero had treated two Spanish missionaries who died of Ebola in August and September after they were flown back from west Africa.

Doctors said she will be able to live a normal life and poses no contamination risk. 

Ms Romero was said to be heartbroken after Spanish officials killed her dog Excalibur instead of putting it into quarantine over fears it may have contracted the disease.

The nurse cared for Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who died on September 25 after being infected with Ebola while he treated patients in Sierra Leone.

Another Spanish priest, 75-year-old Miguel Pajares, had died in Madrid in August after being flown back from missionary work in Liberia.

Ms Romero was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from Ebola sufferers who had survived the disease, and other drugs which a government spokesman declined to name.

One was the experimental anti-viral medicine favipiravir, according to the respected national newspaper El Mundo.

Ms Romero is the only known sufferer of Ebola in Spain after the death of the two priests. 

A new 80-bed treatment centre for treating patients suffering from Ebola funded by the British taxpayer has opened in Sierra Leone. 

The Kerrytown facility will be managed by Save the Children while a 12-bed centre staffed by British Army Medics will concentrate on health care workers struck down by the virus. 

The work was funded by the Department of International Development and the job was overseen by British Army Royal Engineers. 

British Army Royal Engineers took just eight weeks to build the new treatment facility in Sierra Leone 

The treatment centre has also doubled Sierra Leone's capacity to test samples of the killer disease 

In addition to the treatment beds, the facility has a laboratory to identify new cases of the disease. 

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'Sierra Leone does not have enough hospital beds to cope with the scale of the Ebola crisis. Patients are being turned away from hospitals, reducing their chance of survival and allowing the disease to spread.

'That is why British Army Engineers together with Sierra Leonean construction workers have been working round the clock for the last eight weeks to get Kerry Town built. This treatment facility, the first of six British-built centres, will give patients the care they need to fight Ebola, limiting the spread of this terrible disease.'
