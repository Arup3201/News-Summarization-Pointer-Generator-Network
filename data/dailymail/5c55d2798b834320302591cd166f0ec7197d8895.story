The father of murdered schoolgirl Tia Sharp is expecting a new child with his partner later this year, he revealed today.

Steven Carter's girlfriend Melissa Potter is around 14 weeks pregnant and is due to give birth in mid-December.

The 31-year-old said he was told he was going to become a father again a week before his daughter's killer Stuart Hazell went on trial.

Mr Carter, who called for Hazell to hang after he was jailed for life, said that he saw the baby as 'a blessing from Tia'.

He told MailOnline: 'We found out we were expecting another baby just before the trial but kept it under wraps because we just wanted to get justice for Tia.

Victim: Tia Sharp, 12, who was murdered by Stuart Hazell

'My family and a few close friends knew before the case got to court - but we wanted to keep it quiet.

'We feel the baby is a blessing from Tia, I know that will sound strange to some people, but it is something for us to look forward to now.

'We will never forget her but I don't think Tia would be happy with us just moping around and this is a chance to move on.

'At the end of this month we have got her birthday and then in August it is the first anniversary, so it is hard.'

Mr Carter moved to Moulton, Northamptonshire, from New Addington, south London, after splitting up with Tia's mother Natalie Sharp when she was a baby.

He already has an nine-year-old son called Thomas with his long-term partner Melissa and was delighted to learn that she is expecting again.

The family have just returned from a short break in Majorca 'to get away from it all' after their harrowing courtroom experience last month.

Mr Carter said that later this year he will face the difficult task of redecorating Tia's bedroom for the new baby, although they don't yet know the sex.

And the father said that his son gave him a father's day card at the weekend signed from 'Thomas and Tia'.

Mr Carter added: 'The card said love from Thomas and Tia. He said he knew Tia couldn't write it herself so he had to write it for her.

'He asks a lot of questions about Tia and I have hundreds of pictures of them together, so it is very hard.'

Mr Carter was in the public gallery for the first week of Hazell's trial at the Old Bailey in May before the killer dramatically changed his plea to guilty.

Hazell, the 37-year-old cannabis-smoking boyfriend of Tia’s grandmother Christine Bicknell, had insisted for nine months that Tia’s death was a ‘tragic accident’.

The father-of-one claimed she slipped and broke her neck while he was babysitting her at the home he shared with Miss Bicknell.

He said he panicked, wrapped the body in sheets and hid it in the loft where it was discovered by police during their fourth search.

Steven Carter broke down in tears when Hazell finally confessed to the murder. In an impassioned statement outside the court, he called for the killer to face the death penalty.

‘The 
four days of trial here were very hard to deal with, hearing the vile 
things Hazell did to Tia,' he said.

'He should serve his time and then be hung. I do not see today’s events as justice for Tia, merely a legal conviction.’

Mr Carter said he is furious that Hazell is planning to appeal against his 38-year prison sentence.

'I go out to work and pay my taxes for Hazell to sit in his prison cell where he is protected. The whole situation is unbelievable,' he added.
