Holland is a jubilant sea of orange tonight after the national team thrashed world champions Spain in sensational revenge for the last World Cup final.

The 5-1 group stage upset in Brazil came four years after Spain beat the Netherlands 1-0 in the tetchy 2010 final in South Africa.

Fans at the Fonte Nova Arena in Salvador were decked from head to toe in the national colour - with everything from orange feather fascinators to bunches of carrots.

Alongside the Dutch fans in the stadium itself were thousands on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janiero, which turned into the party of a lifetime as Holland secured one of its greatest victories in recent years.

Spain is ranked first in the World Cup rankings - while the Netherlands sits at a lowly 15th.

On home soil the Dutch were equally as jubilant as their compatriots thousands of miles away.

In Eindhoven, the 35,000-seater Philips Stadion - stands, pitch and all, turned into an orange blur as fans shouted in joy through goal after goal.

Spain took an early lead after a dubious penalty but it wasn't long before the Dutch equalised and began their rout.

The Dutch took revenge with two goals each for Van Persie and Robben and one by Stefan de Vrij.

Spain have won the last three major football tournaments they have played in, wining the European Championships in 2008 and 2012 as well as the 2010 World Cup.

Spain,
 also 2008 and 2012 European champions, took a 27th-minute lead through a
 Xabi Alonso penalty after Brazilian-born striker Diego Costa went down 
under a challenge from de Vrij, only for Van Persie to equalise 
brilliantly in the 44th minute.

The
 Dutch forward stole in between Sergio Ramos and Jordi Alba to meet a 
searching Daley Blind cross with a powerful diving header that left 
goalkeeper Iker Casillas rooted.

Moments
 before Van Persie's goal Spain missed a glorious chance to double their
 lead when midfielder David Silva's cheeky chip was pushed wide for a 
corner.

It was a wasted chance they came to rue.

After the break the Dutch poured forward and went ahead after 53 minutes when Robben got on the end of another superb Blind lobbed pass before turning Gerard Pique and holding off Sergio Ramos to fire home from seven metres.

The match opened up but in the 
Netherlands' favour with De Vrij stealing in on 64 minutes at the back 
post to convert a free kick after Van Persie put Casillas under 
pressure.

It got worse for 
Spain as Van Persie added a fourth after taking advantage of a sloppy 
touch by Casillas to slot home in the 72nd minute and Robben stunned a 
raucous crowd as he toyed with the Spanish defence and Casillas before 
belting home in the 80th.

The defeat was the heaviest for Spain under coach Vicente Del Bosque.
