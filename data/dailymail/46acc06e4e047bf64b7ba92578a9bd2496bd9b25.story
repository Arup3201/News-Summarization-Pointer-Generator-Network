A smoker is paying a heavy price for his habit after he was seen dropping his roll-up butt.

Mariusz Jamrozek, 46, was handed a £75 on-the-spot fine after he was caught by two council enforcement officers in Burton, Staffordshire.

When he failed to pay, he was summonsed to Stafford Magistrates Court, where he was fined £420, along with £180 in court costs and a £20 victim surcharge, totalling £620.

Jamrozek, who describes himself on his Facebook page as a manager at Hilton Hotel at St George's Park, Burton-on-Trent, said: 'I didn't even know it was a crime to drop a cigarette on the floor - it's a tiny piece of paper.

'I will struggle to pay this fine; I only get paid around £1,000 each month and I have to pay for rent and my car with that money so I don't have much left.

'If they had told me it was a crime I would have just picked it up, put it in the bin and that would have been it. I won't be dropping another one from now on.'

Jamrozek, of Branston Road, Burton, was walking through Burton town centre when he was spotted smoking on High Street by two council enforcement officers.

The officers watched him drop the cigarette butt outside Lloyds Bank and immediately stepped in to take action.

Jamrozek, originally from Poland, told the court: 'When I came out of the bank there were two men waiting for me. They shouting at me and were telling me to show them my ID. It was very confusing for me.

On-the-spot fines or Fixed Penalty Notices allow police and other officials to immediately punish people for with low-level, anti-social and nuisance offending.

Fines were first introduced for littering in 1990 and have since been expanded for a range of environmental crimes as a result of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, and the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005.

The majority of these are given out for leaving litter, dog fouling and fly posting.

Penalties range from £20 for unnecessary idling of a stationary vehicle engine and £75 for littering, to £500 for failing to comply with a noise warning notice in licenced premises.

Notices are mostly issued by local authority officers, but police and Environment Agency officers are also authorised to hand them out.

'I didn't know what I had done wrong at first as I don't speak English very well.'

He was given a £75 on-the-spot fine, which he did not pay. Jamrozek was then taken to court where he was fined £420, along with £180 in court costs and a £20 victim surcharge.

Councillor Sonia Andjelkovic for East Staffordshire Borough Council said: 'Council officers do a great deal to encourage people to behave responsibly but unfortunately a small minority continue to drop litter.

'It is only right and proper that we bring such individuals before the courts.

'Anybody found dropping litter will receive a fixed penalty notice of £75 or face the prospect of a court appearance.'

Chief Inspector Steve Maskrey, from Burton's police team, warned that people littering could and would be prosecuted: 'I know that local enforcement officers at the borough council spend a lot of money trying to keep our streets clean, and people who carelessly drop litter do not help.

'I fully support officers handing out the fixed penalty tickets. Offenders need to learn that littering is a crime and it will not be tolerated.

'If they are seen by a local enforcement officer then action will definitely be taken against them.'
