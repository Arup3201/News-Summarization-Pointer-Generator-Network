Ander Herrera was given a tour of Manchester United's Carrington training ground along with his entourage on Wednesday.

The 24-year-old midfielder also had his photographs taken for the club website ahead of the official announcement of his £28.7million transfer from Athletic Bilbao.

The Spaniard stepped off a train at Stockport just after 1.30pm to be met by United security staff before being whisked away with his representatives and friends to Manchester.

Herrera has become Louis van Gaal’s first signing as Manchester United manager. 

United moved to pay the buy-out clause 
fee for the 24-year-old Athletic Bilbao midfielder on Tuesday, with the 
player signing a four-year contract. Former club Real Zaragoza are due £1million sell-on fee as part of the deal.

Herrera, an intelligent and stylish midfielder, was the subject of a £24m offer from David Moyes’s United last summer. 

At that time they did not believe it was worth paying the best part of £5m more to make the deal happen.

United denied problems trying to sign Herrera last year — namely when three lawyers turned up at La Liga headquarters in an attempt to push through the transfer without knowledge of either club.

They know the buy-out figure is due to rise to £32m from July 1 and Ed Woodward, the club’s executive vice-chairman, did not want another saga to drag on this summer.

Herrera has been watched by United for more than three years, with Sir Alex Ferguson’s brother Martin among the first to bring him to the club’s attention.

Forward planning: Incoming United boss Louis van Gaal is aiming to strengthen his squad this summer

Despite shelving the signing last August, Moyes had promised Herrera he would monitor his progress. A dip in form followed but he recovered to help propel Bilbao to fourth place in La Liga.

Herrera, part of Spain’s Olympic squad at London 2012, was also a team-mate of United’s Juan Mata and David de Gea with Spain Under 21s.

Van Gaal is already starting to put his mark on the squad, with Antonio Valencia and Patrice Evra both signing contract extensions.
