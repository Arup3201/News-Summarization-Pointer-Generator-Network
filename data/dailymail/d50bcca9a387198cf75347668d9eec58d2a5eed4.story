Dozens of tourists have been struck down with the same illness while heading to a popular holiday destination.

While on their way to the Blue Mountains in NSW many of 25 Japanese visitors on the same tour bus started showing symptoms of food poisoning.

Most of the people on board were suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Earlier that morning they had all been on a stopover in Brisbane where they shared a meal. 

Dozens of Japanese tourists on a tour bus were struck down with a violent stomach illness on Tuesday

Paramedics were called to a street in Chipping Norton where they assessed patients

Some tourists had to be transported to hospital via ambulance

Just after 1pm on Monday paramedics were called to Governor Macquarie Drive in Chipping Norton when the tourists were apparently en route to Katoomba in the Blue Mountains.

Pictures show the medics geared up assessing the sick holidaymakers, checking blood pressure and other symptoms.

Wearing masks and other protective gear they checked people one by one by the side of the road before transporting some of them in ambulances.

Others who weren't as sick piled out of the bus and sat by the side of the road wearing face masks 

A spokeswoman for south-west Sydney Local Health District said the patients were exhibiting signs of food poisoning

Four people were admitted to Liverpool Hospital and are now in a stable condition

Initially the first sick tourist was quarantined in the bathroom of Murray coach the group were travelling in, a witness told the website, before more of the passengers began to fall ill.

Michael Akkari said the patients were transported to hospital in the coach, which was used as a 'quarantine capsule'.

'The less sick ones sat on the grass strip beside the bus. They were obviously concerned, but there were a few laughs being had,' he said. 

A south-west Sydney Local Health District spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia they were taken to Liverpool Hospital, where four people were admitted.

She said that all were in a stable condition, and had exhibited the same symptoms consistent with food poisoning.

Another spokesman made it clear to The Sydney Morning Herald 'this is definitely not a case of Ebola'.
