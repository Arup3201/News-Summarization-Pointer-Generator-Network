Iker Casillas doesn’t believe any English side will provide direct threat to Real Madrid retaining their Champions League title.

The 33-year-old has poured scorn on the prospect of Chelsea winning another European crown, only seeing Bayern Munich and capital rivals Atletico as genuine challengers.

Real – who beat Atletico in extra-time of last season’s final in Lisbon – have qualified from their Champions League group this campaign with a match to spare and are two points clear at the top of La Liga.

Carlo Ancelotti’s side have won their last 18 games in all competitions, with Casillas’ confidence hardly coming as a surprise.

'I think we will have to go right until the end to fight for the league,' the goalkeeper told AS.

'But our main rivals in Europe? Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid.’

No side has retained the Champions League. 

After their dead rubber against Ludogorets and a La Liga match at the weekend, Real turn their attentions to the Club World Cup in Morocco next week.

'We are going with the aim of becoming world champions,’ Casillas added. ‘We have done well this year and what better way is there to put the icing on the cake?’

Casillas has found himself back between the sticks on a regular basis for Real this season
