George Clooney and fiancé Amal Alamuddin are busy making wedding plans. And while they’ve pretty much decided to walk down the aisle in September – the one year anniversary of when they met – they were still looking for on the perfect venue.

Now they've zeroed in on Highclere Castle near London – the home of TV’s Downton Abbey!

As MailOnline reported earlier this week, Clooney flew to London on Wednesday and whisked his fiancé away for a surprise mini holiday in the English Countryside.

And one of George’s romantic destinations was Highclere, because he knows that while his lady love isn’t a big TV fan, she adores Downton Abbey.

Royal wedding: Last week George took Amal Alamuddin to Highclere Castle - the home of Downton Abbey

‘George became close friends with Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Robert Crawley, when they did Monuments Men together last year,’ says a source.

‘And they really hit it off. He contacted Hugh and asked him to arrange a private tour of the castle. Amal was blown away.

‘When he saw his bride-to-be’s reaction to the spectacular Victorian castle, set on 1,000 acres of parkland, he began making some discrete inquires about having their wedding performed there.

And he was told they would be most happy to accommodate them!’

Highclere has been the residence of the Carnarvon family since 1679.  And it’s currently inhabited by the 8th Lord and Lady Carnarvon and their family. The castle does allow weddings, and prices to hire parts of the castle alone, begin at about $23,000 for one night.

Couples can marry in the Saloon, with the bride descending the sweeping oak staircase featured on the series. That room can hold about 120 guests, but the dining room can accommodate up to 400 people. They will also provide Marquees on the grounds where guests can dine, dance and celebrate.

The castle boasts an award winning chef in Paul Brooke Taylor, who prepares some of the Carnarvon families favorites, as well as vegetarian and vegan fare. They also specialise in authentic Victorian foods and they offer an extensive wine list.

‘George loves the idea of marrying at the castle, because it’s a glamorous place he could secure,’ says the source. ‘And the same way Kanye West and Kim’s wedding guests were given a private tour of The Palace of Versailles, a private tour of not only the castle and grounds, but of the famous Egyptian Antique Exhibition in the Castle cellars could be arranged.’

In 1922, the 5th Earl of Carnarvon discovered the Egyptian tomb of the young Pharaoh Tutankhamen.  And although most of his findings are now housed in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, many of the artifacts still remain in the castle.

When Shirley MacLaine was working on Downton Abbey, she was very impressed with the Castle’s current collection that includes jewelry, art, decorative jars, and the coffin of a 3,500 year old  Egyptian Nobel woman.

‘Amal’s Middle Eastern relatives would most certainly enjoy the exhibition, and the tour would make for a most memorable wedding,’ adds the source.

Highclere would also be a perfect place for George and Amal to tie the knot because of its close proximity to London and the fact it’s only 50 miles away from Heathrow Airport.

And while many of Amal’s family members live in Dubai, and Lebanon, her mother lives in London. 

‘Amal grew up in London, and attended school in Buckinghamshire,’ says another source. ‘And she went to University at Oxford.

She currently works in London so she has many close British friends. Her mother Baria has also been living in London for years – since the 1980s – and is the respected editor of a London – based Arab newspaper.

Her father, Ramzi returned to Lebanon in the early 1990s, but he often visits London and can easily travel there.

‘There is still a lot to be decided in addition to wedding details, like where the couple will live,’ says the source. ‘And Amal would like for George to sell his Studio City house because it’s such a ‘guy place,’ and find somewhere more suitable to them start their life together.
