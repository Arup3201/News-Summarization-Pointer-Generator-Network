The cold case of a Cleveland girl who disappeared almost 19 years ago might finally be coming to end after human remains were discovered Friday under a busy highway overpass on the Ohio city’s west side.

Convicted sex offender Edwin Acevedo Jr, 49, of Clevland, has been named a person of interest and was taken into custody only hours before the remains were discovered. Mr Acevedo is a career criminal with a history of sex-related crimes going back over 20 years.

He might finally be the answer to the question that has haunted Cleveland since 1995 – what happened to Christina Adkins?

Not so cold case: Edwin Castro Jr, 49, has been named a person of interest in the disappearance of Christina Adkins, missing since 1995

The search human remains under the highway overpass began in earnest Friday morning, according to FBI special agent Vicki Anderson. A team of almost 30 people combed the remote area for hours before calling in the Cuyahoga County Coroner.

Led by the FBI Violent Crimes Task Force, the search led to the discovery of an almost fully intact human skeleton, WKYC reported. Authorities believe it is likely the remains of the missing girl.

The human bones were found only blocks from Ms Adkins' former home, and within walking distance of two other locations recently searched by officials.

This is the second search in as many weeks, according to NewsChannel 5, authorities searched a nearby field last week and came up empty.

The remains are now with the medical examiner's office and will be compared against DNA from Ms Adkins family, it could anywhere from days to weeks to determine the identity.

Ms Adkins was also 18-years-old when she went missing. The teen was five months pregnant when she went missing Jan 11, 1995 while walking to her boyfriend’s house in the same neighborhood terrorized by serial killer Anthony Sowell and dungeon master Ariel Castro.

Neighbors of the missing girl expressed hope the case would soon be resolved.

‘We all figured that she was somewhere, probably not alive, because she never contacted anybody,’ a neighbor told NewsChannel  5.

‘I wish they could have found her before her dad died, because I know that broke his heart,’ another neighbour said. ‘He didn’t know where she was.’

Another neighbour said the person responsible needs toconfess.

‘I think they need to step forward and say why they did it,’ a mother of a boy who once dated Ms Adkins told NewsChannel 5. ‘She was never harm to no one, she was a loving person, a giving person.’

Mr Acevedo, arrested only hours before the skeleton was discovered, was previously linked to the case during an August search of his home, but cleared. Officials appear confident they can prove this time he’s their man.

Currently sitting in Cuyahoga County Jail, Mr Acevedo’s criminal history goes all the way back to 1998, when he was charged for theft and receiving stolen property, according to court records.

Mr Acevedo was convicted of sexual battery in 2003, he served three years in prison for that offense.

The violent man was also charged this past June with two counts of rape for a June 1993 incident where he is accused of strangling an 18-year-old girl unconscious before twice raping her in a field, records cited by the Cleveland Plain-Dealer show.

Officials were previously hopeful that Ms Adkins’ remains might be found among the bodies discovered rotting at serial killer Anthony Sowell’s house of horrors, but she was not among the 11 known victims.

When news came of three women freed from kidnapper and sex torturer Ariel Castro’s house, the hope that Ms Adkins was among the victims was quickly dashed.

The information that led officials to this latest discovery began pouring in around Labor Day, according to Ms Anderson, and it may finally bring closure to the missing girl’s tormented family.

Speaking to NewsChannel 5, Tonya Adkins said its time for her missing sister’s story to have an ending.

‘I still want to know where my sister is and what happened to her.’

Mr Acevedo has yet to be charged in Ms Adkins disappearance, MailOnline was unable to reach officials for further comment.
