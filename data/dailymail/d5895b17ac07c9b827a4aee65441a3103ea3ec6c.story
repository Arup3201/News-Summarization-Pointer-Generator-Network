This is the CCTV image of a man police want to question in connection with two serious attacks

This is the man police are hunting after two lone women were attacked at knifepoint and slashed with a blade.

Extra police have been patrolling the Hounslow area of London after two women were assaulted within ten days of each other in night time attacks.

Police have issued an image of a man they want to question in connection with serious attacks on two young women within 10 days of each other.

A 19-year-old woman was approached from behind, grabbed by an attacker and cut with a bladed item across her neck in the first of the two assaults.

It happened shortly before midnight on August 7 in Hanworth Road, Hounslow, west London, near the junction with St Stephens Road, Scotland Yard said.

The second incident occurred on Friday, at about 1.30am, in nearby Whitton Road, near the junction with Murray Avenue.

A 26-year-old was approached from behind and sliced across her face with a bladed item.

Both women suffered deep cuts which required hospital treatment.

Detectives have formally linked the two incidents and extra officers have been patrolling the area following the attacks.

The suspect is described as a black man, or a light-skinned black man, aged between 18 and 25 years, and between 5ft 6ins and 5ft 11ins.

Borough commander for Hounslow Carl Bussey said: 'I would ask people to be extra vigilant and aware of their environment, particularly when walking late at night.

'These sorts of crimes are thankfully rare in Hounslow, but I would like to reassure people that my officers are working tirelessly to catch whoever is responsible.

'Extra officers will be on patrol in the area while this investigation continues.'

Police have urged a male cyclist who came to the aid of the victim in Hanworth Road to contact them as they believe he may have information that could help the investigation.

Detectives would also like to speak to anyone in the area who has been followed in the last few weeks, or has noticed a man fitting the description acting suspiciously.

Anyone with information is asked to contact them on 0208 721 4155 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
