An astronaut spending time alone on the ISS gazes out into the cosmos when, suddenly, they feel themselves being hugged.

No, this isn’t the plot for a space romance movie, rather, it’s a scenario envisaged by Unlimited Theatre in West Yorkshire.

As part of a Nasa contest they’ve designed a spacesuit that can not only simulate the feeling of being hugged, but also give an astronaut live information about their home town.

A team from West Yorkshire has won one of the categories in Nasa's International Space Apps Challenge by designing a prototype spacesuit for future astronauts (pictured with founder Jon Spooner inside). The design includes inflatable shoulders that can be used to give the astronaut a 'wearable hug'

The contest is an annual Nasa-run event called the International Space Apps Challenge.

Taking place over two days in cities around the world, the contest sees teams attempt to solve problems related to both life on Earth and space with open-source solutions.

Tim Peake, currently training with Esa, will be the first British astronaut to visit the ISS when he launches in November 2015.

The first Briton in space was Helen Sharman in November 1989, who also became the first woman to visit the Soviet Union’s Mir space station.

No other solely British people have been to space, although there have been some with dual citizenship.

Of these four were British-American: Michael Foale (nine missions), Piers Sellers (three missions), Nicholas Patrick (two missions) and Richard Garriott (one paid mission).

And one other, Michael Shuttleworth, is a South African-Brit who also paid to go to space.

These take place within five themes: Earth Watch, Technology in Space, Human Spaceflight, Robotics and Asteroids.

The team from the Unlimited Theatre, calling themselves the Unlimited Space Agency, were taking part in a project to create wearable technologies for future astronauts at the Met Office’s site in Exeter.

To do so they consulted with British astronaut Tim Peake, who is set to travel to the ISS on a 6-month mission in November 2015.

Their final design, the team says, was to create a suit that was both uniquely useful for astronauts on the ISS but also with applications on Earth.

The most interesting innovation was the ‘wearable hug’ feature.

A family member on Earth could activate inflatable material in the shoulders of the suit to give the astronaut a simulated hug and let them know they’re being thought of.

The spacesuit designed by Unlimited Theatre has a number of innovations designed for future astronauts. These include inflatable shoulders that can simulate a 'hug' and a set of LEDs on the wrist that tell the astronaut what the weather is like back home.

The project was undertaken by a group of students of all ages at the Met Office's site in Exeter under the auspices of the Unlimited Theatre Company (with the temporary name of the Unlimited Space Agency), while British astronaut in training Tim Peake provided additional support via video chat (pictured)

Meanwhile, on the sleeve of the suit is a vision board that displays live weather status for the wearer’s home location.

And in the pocket they envisage a future 3D printer that can instantly deliver tools, parts and gifts directly to the astronaut.

Another innovative feature would be a mission patch that people on Earth can wear.

This would light up with embedded LEDs when the ISS passes overhead.

The team says this same technology could be used for other purposes, such as providing updates as to when a football team scores a goal.

Their project was named the overall global winner of the Best Mission Concept category.

And the company hopes some of their ideas will go into a spacesuit to be worn by Tim Peake when he undertakes his mission to the ISS.

'A scientist would not have come up with the idea of a wearable hug, that was one of the fashion student’s ideas,’ Jon Spooner, one of the founders of the Unlimited Theatre Company, told the Yorkshire Evening Post.

‘A lot of people assume that only scientists can do useful stuff and that is not right. It’s about working in collaboration with people.

‘No one person can achieve anything on their own. It’s all about exploration and ideas.

‘We’re delighted to have won. While we’re proud leaders of the project, it was a truly collaborative effort and is further evidence of the power of art, play and storytelling to inspire engagement with science.

'The support we received in particular from the Met Office and the Faculty of Arts and Design at Exeter College was inspirational.'

Tim Peake, meanwhile, added: ‘The Unlimited Space Agency is great. Their approach to inspiring children about science is rigorous, fun and it works.

'I’m proud to serve with them on their mission to inspire the next generation of scientists and space explorers.’
