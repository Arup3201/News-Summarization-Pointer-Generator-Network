A gunman shouting ‘The English are waking up!’ shot dead one person and critically wounded another during the attempted assassination of a separatist Canadian politician.

Parti Québécois leader Pauline Marois was hauled offstage by security guards midway through her live TV victory speech when the attacker opened fire.

The 62-year-old shooter, who was wearing a mask and dark clothing, was seconds away from the podium when he was grabbed by an armed bodyguard.

Marois, who has just been elected 
premier of Quebec, wants the French-speaking province to secede from 
Canada - and probably the Commonwealth too.

Police have revealed that she was the target but have not disclosed the gunman’ s identity.

The shooting has highlighted the 
troubled relationship that Quebec has with the rest of the Canada which 
has grown rancorous in recent years.

Marois inspires particularly strong 
feelings as she has vowed to ban government workers from wearing 
religious clothing like the hijab and stop French speaking people from 
going to English speaking colleges.

Some have even been calling for the outgoing Quebec Premier Jean Charest, a federalist, to be murdered and dumped in a car boot.

The attack began on Tuesday night as Marois was speaking at a concert hall in Montreal to celebrate her win in the polls.

As the commotion broke out she was 
grabbed by plainclothes police with a concerned look on her face as she 
said: ‘What’s going on?’

Montreal police Commander Ian 
Lafreniere said that the gunman set off a Molotov Cocktail at the rear 
door after using it to enter the building.

The 48-year-old man who was shot dead 
has not been identified and the victim who survived, aged 27, is still 
in hospital, but is no longer in a critical condition.

A third person, a man in his 30s, had to be taken to hospital suffering from shock.

The suspect is from Quebec but police are not sure if he is an anglophone or francophone as he was using both languages.

Caught the gunman: The 50-year-old unidentified man was caught by police. His motive was unclear but while police dragged him away he yelled in French: 'The English are waking up!'

Police said that the gunman lit a fire behind the Metropolis Theatre before he was arrested

Detectives have searched his car and 
interviewed witnesses but have not yet spoken to the shooter and refused
to speculate as to his motives.

The reaction in Canada has been one of
shock and in a statement translated from French Marois said: ‘My 
thoughts go out to the family and friends of the deceased.

‘As a result of this tragedy, all Quebecers who are grieving today in the face of such senseless violence’.

A statement issued by Canadian Prime 
Minister Stephen Harper’s office said: ‘We are disturbed by this 
violence and our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones.’

Police on the scene: It was not clear whether the gunman intended to shoot Ms Marois whose party favours separation for the French-speaking province from Canada

Quebec first elected a separatist 
government in 1976 and has since repeatedly argued with the rest of the 
country, which speaks English as its first language.

Parti Québécois’s win against the 
Liberal incumbents means that a separatist government is back in power 
in the province for the first time in a decade.

If Quebec seceded from Canada it is 
unlikely it would remain in the Commonwealth due to the hardline 
attitude of Marois and her colleagues.

As a nation however, Canadians think 
well of the Royal family and during their visit to the country last year
after their wedding, Prince William and Kate Middleton were given a 
very warm reception.

The people of Quebec rejected the last separatist referendum in 1995, although by a small margin.
