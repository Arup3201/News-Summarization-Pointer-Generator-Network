England fell agonisingly short in their bid to win the 2015 RBS 6 Nations despite a 55-35 victory over France at Twickenham.

Stuart Lancaster's side finished runners-up for the fourth straight year after falling six points shy of overhauling Ireland on points difference.

Here, Sportsmail's SAM PETERS rates the England players for the tournament: 

Mike Brown: Recovered from concussion against Italy to produce some excellent rugby. Missed in Dublin but looks back to his best. 7.5/10

Mike Brown jumps to try and catch the ball up against France's Gael Fickou at Twickenham

Alex Goode: Only start against Ireland was tough. Had a reasonable game but lacked Brown’s snarling edge and defensive solidity. 6

Jonny May: Dropped for ignoring overlap against Italy. May be some time before he gets another shot at international game. 4.5

Jack Nowell: Replaced May in Dublin and hardly put a foot wrong in three high-octane displays. Lacks electric pace but has nous, strength and courage. 8

Anthony Watson: Excellent in opening win over Wales and tidy for the rest of the tournament but still with something to prove. 6.5

Jonathan Joseph: England’s outstanding attacking player. Proved big doesn’t have to be beautiful with exceptional running lines. 9

Jonathan Joseph was England's outstanding attacking player throughout the Six Nations

Luther Burrell: High work-rate and strong carrying but may struggle to retain place when Barritt and Tuilagi are fit. Top team player. 6

George Ford: Proved doubters wrong with composed, intelligent displays which showcased his ability to time passes to perfection. 8.5

George Ford proved his doubters wrong with composed, intelligent displays at fly-half

Ben Youngs: Back to his best and firmly in place as first-choice No 9 for World Cup. High-class partnership with Ford. 8

Joe Marler: Struggled against Scotland but in general, set-piece work was excellent. Must carry more. 7 

Ben Youngs was back to his best int he Six Nations and cemented his position as first choice scrum-half

Dylan Hartley: Nowhere near effective enough in the loose and line-out throwing also below his own high standards. 5.5

Dan Cole: Exceptional all-round contribution after starting against Wales with little rugby following injury. 8

George Kruis: Harshly dropped from squad after loss in Ireland but will have learned from his experience. Excellent prospect. 6.5

Dave Attwood: Unable to further his case after strong autumn. Not effective enough in tight and struggled to exert authority. 5.5

Courtney Lawes: Returned to fitness for last two games and reminded us of his world-class attributes. Superb athlete. 8.5

Courtney Lawes showed glimpses of his world-class ability after returning to fitness for the last two games

Geoff Parling: Back in the starting line-up against France and produced a highly effective and mobile contribution. 7

James Haskell: Superb display in Cardiff but tapered off and sin bin against France was costly. 6.5

Billy Vunipola: Outstanding tournament for the ball-carrying No 8. Hardly put a foot wrong and work-rate was incredible. 9

Billy Vunipola hardly put a foot wrong for England at No 8 throughout the entire competition

Chris Robshaw: Tireless and consistent leadership. Lacks pace for an openside but is dogged, determined and unflappable. 7

Subs: Cipriani 6.5, Wigglesworth 7, Wood 6.5, Easter 6.5, Brookes 6.5, T Youngs 6.5.
