Russian media magnate Alexander Lebedev faces up to five years in prison if convicted of hooliganism motivated by 'political hatred' after clashing with Sergei Polonsky on television

Supermodel Natalia Vodianova has called on a Russian judge to reach a fair verdict in Alexander Lebedev’s controversial trial in Moscow. 

This comes as Sergei Polonsky, whose evidence could jail billionaire Lebedev for up to five years, has himself admitted that he was unhurt by two punches thrown by the media tycoon, a court heard today. 

A complaint by Polonsky, 40, about the alleged blows was seized upon by prosecutors in Moscow who charged Lebedev, a former KGB spy, with hooliganism motivated by 'political hatred'.

In a statement by Ms Vodianova read to court from the rags-to-riches beauty nicknamed Supernova, she spoke of her friendship with the media tycoon and his 'exceptional human decency and solid attitude to injustice'.

The clash happened during a television talk show about the Russian economy when the discussion became heated. 

However, 53-year-old Lebedev's Moscow trial today heard that ex-paratrooper Polonsky, now a property mogul, openly admitted on another show that he was unhurt by the attack. 

'I am professionally trained to a sufficient level,' he said.

'I managed to avoid it, otherwise I would have ended up with a broken jaw.'

Another witness - a martial arts experts who has trained Russian special forces troops - today claimed that the punches did not touch Polonsky. 

The court case is seen as a litmus test of the use of state power to gag Lebedev, owner of a major Moscow investigative newspaper.

Alexander Lebedev apparently lashing out at Polonsky during a Russian TV debate - but a martial arts expert told court today that the punches did not hit Polonsky

His family also owns The Independent titles and the London Evening Standard in Britain. 

A judge overruled state prosecutors and Polonsky's lawyers to show a video with Polonsky's apparent confession in court.

In the footage, Polonsky also said that Lebedev struck out twice.

Natalia Vodianova pleaded with the judge to give Lebedev a fair judgement due to his good character

If
that claim is accepted by the court, it would be significant because 
the politically-motivated hooliganism charge depends on at least three 
strikes being landed. 

Supermodel Natalia Vodianova, 31, 
told of Lebedev’s unpublicised commitment to her charity Naked Hearts 
Foundation which aims to provide playgrounds for deprived children 
across Russia. 

‘Alexander Lebedev is my long term friend, and also a friend and donor of the Foundation Naked Hearts,’ she said. 

‘Knowing
Lebedev for a long time, I have had numerous chances to make sure of 
his fidelity to his principles, exceptional human decency and solid 
attitude to injustice. 

‘This man can support you with wise advice or with action.

‘Naked
Hearts Foundation is very lucky to have Alexander Lebedev among its 
donors. He has not only seen the true value of our charity, but kept 
supporting us for seven years.’

She
appealed to the judge:  ‘I am asking to do all what you can to make 
sure the investigation is appropriate and impersonal and is carried out 
according to the law of Russia.’

Martial
arts expert Igor Zaichokov told the court that the only physical 
contact between Lebedev and Polonsky was when the media magnate pushed 
away the property mogul's hand in a defensive gesture before the 
so-called 'punch-up'.

The expert denied Lebedev's two strikes had actually touched Polonsky.

He also contradicted earlier evidence and said there was nothing 'professional' about the way the ex-spy had struck out in Polonsky's direction.  

The court was shown a video of Polonsky apparently admitting he was unhurt by the alleged blows

'If Lebedev's punches reached Polonsky's head, his head would have pulled away in unnatural way,' he said.

'This
is how boxing judges make their decisions about punches. They do not 
need to witness the moment of the punch, they just follow the way the 
body part pulls away. 

'For me it is clear that Lebedev's punches did not reach Polonsky.'

He
told the judge: 'I made this conclusion based on my experience in 
martial arts and on a number of books devoted mainly to psychological 
aspects of body conflict.'

Other
witnesses have said that Polonsky instinctively moved backwards as 
Lebedev approached him, causing his chair to fall backwards off the 
stage. 

Zaichokov, a qualified coach and author of two books on martial arts, has trained special forces troops from Russia's Interior Ministry. 

Polonsky has not given evidence in person at the trial. 

He is on Russia's wanted list over a £121million alleged property fraud in Moscow. 

Film footage suggests he is hiding in a bolt hole in Tel Aviv, Israel, even though the judge in Lebedev's case accepts he is in Cambodia, where he is on bail pending a kidnapping and assault probe.

A verdict in the Lebedev trial - which critics say has political motives - is expected next month.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
