A British university student facing trial and imprisonment in America for breaking anti-piracy laws has won his fight against extradition.

In a deal which is believed to be a legal first, Richard O’Dwyer, 24, will instead travel to the US voluntarily and pay a small sum in compensation.

Supporters have hailed the decision, which follows a campaign led by his mother, Julia.

Student Richard O'Dwyer with his mother Julia after hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court in January he would be extradited to the United States. That decision has now been overturned

The paediatric nurse, who lives near 
Chesterfield, fought on behalf of her son, who had run the TVShack 
website from his halls of residence at Sheffield Hallam University.

The US authorities claimed TVShack 
hosted links to pirated films and TV programmes and earned more than 
£147,000 in advertising revenue.

Prosecutors demanded Mr O’Dwyer should
be sent to the States under the controversial 2003 Extradition Act and 
Home Secretary Theresa May signed a warrant for his extradition at the 
start of the year. But after negotiations by Mr O’Dwyer’s legal team, he
has signed a ‘deferred prosecution’ agreement.

The Daily Mail lead the fight against Gary McKinnon's extradition to the U.S. where he has been wanted to answer charges of hacking since 2002.

Mr McKinnon (above) admits accessing U.S. government computers but claims he was looking for evidence of UFOs.Mr McKinnon, from Wood Green, London, has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism, and faced 60 years in jail if convicted in the U.S.

Bail conditions, imposed since 2005, meant he was banned from  using a computer and accessing the internet.On
October 16 this year Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs there was no 
doubt Mr McKinnon was 'seriously ill' and the extradition warrant 
against him should be withdrawn.

At the High Court yesterday a judge 
was told that Mr O’Dwyer was expected to complete the agreement in the 
next 14 days, pay a small sum in compensation and give undertakings not 
to infringe copyright laws again.

His extradition application is then 
expected to return to the High Court so it can formally be disposed of. 
Judge Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen’s Bench Division, said: 
‘It would be very nice for everyone if this was resolved happily before 
Christmas.’

Sir John also said it was a ‘very satisfactory outcome’.

Campaigners drew comparisons between 
the case of Mr O’Dwyer and Gary McKinnon, the computer hacker saved from
extradition last month after a long Daily Mail campaign.

Like Mr O’Dwyer, Gary’s supposed 
crimes – hacking into military computers, while looking for evidence of 
‘little green men’ – took place from the UK.

Mrs May has promised to introduce a 
test to establish whether a person involved in similar cases should be 
tried in the UK or US.

Tory MP Dominic Raab, who campaigned 
for reform of extradition laws, said: ‘This is a victory for Richard and
his family, a victory for British justice, and a victory for common 
sense. We shouldn’t be subjecting British citizens to rough justice 
under our blunt extradition regime.’

The court heard that O’Dwyer is expected 
to travel to the U.S. in the next 14 days to complete the agreement.

O’Dwyer was facing the prospect of being the first British citizen to be
extradited for such an alleged copyright offence and his lawyers argued
he would effectively become a 'guinea pig' for copyright law in the U.S.

His
mother Julia O’Dwyer, from Chesterfield, said she was 'disgusted' when 
she heard of the U.S. attempt to extradite her son and claimed the UK’s 
extradition treaty with the U.S. 'needs fixing fast'.

The US authorities alleged that O’Dwyer received more than 230,000 US dollars (around £147,000) in advertising revenue since January 2008, until the site was shut down in 2010.

When he was arrested by City of London Police in November 2010, he accepted that he was earning approximately £15,000 per month from online advertisements.

Human rights campaign group Liberty welcomed the proposed settlement of 24-year-old O'Dwyer's case but warned there was still need for reform of extradition laws.

Isabella Sankey, Liberty's director of policy, said: 'This will be a huge relief for Richard - but how appalling that he had to wait so long for the US authorities to make this decision.

'Case after case shows that our extradition arrangements must be overhauled to allow people who have never left these shores to be dealt with here at home. We need urgent legislation to prevent their torment.'
