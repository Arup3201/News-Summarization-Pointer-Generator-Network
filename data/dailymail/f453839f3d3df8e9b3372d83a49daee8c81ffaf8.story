Jailed: Benefit cheat Christopher Mullen, 71, has been sentenced to eight months in prison

A wealthy pensioner who said he claimed £100,000 in benefits 'by mistake' because he couldn't read the paperwork has been jailed.

Christopher Mullen, from Salford, Manchester, cheated the system for nearly 10 years while sitting on a £235,000 nest egg.

He was caught out after the large bank transfers he had made to other accounts attracted the attention of the Serious Organised Crime Agency.

The 71-year-old initially claimed he couldn't read and write and had unwittingly signed forms that his late wife of 47 years had filled in.

However, he has now been locked up for eleven months after finally admitting he knew what he was doing when claiming the money he wasn't entitled to.

The father-of-five's benefits claims were originally legitimate when they began in February 2000, Manchester Crown Court heard.

However, after banking £235,000 from the sale of a property in Ireland, he failed to notify the authorities.

Instead, he continued to claim benefits - including the maximum payout for pension credit, plus housing and council tax benefits - as if he was a poor man with no savings or investments to fall back on.

He held onto the cash as he wished to pass on to his children and grandchildren, the court heard.

David Temkin, prosecuting, said that by the time the Department of Work and Pensions unravelled Mullen's deceit, he had taken £104,974.16 from the taxpayer that he wasn't entitled to.

He added: 'Mullen was interviewed and put forward a prepared statement in which he said he struggled to read and write, his wife used to do the paperwork, he would just sign it.'

Mullen's defence lawyer said the defendant and his wife had not wanted the children's inheritance to be 'dissipated', and that he had maintained a 'modest' lifestyle throughout.

However, the court heard that Mullen had been convicted for a bogus benefit claim back in 1982

Mullen, who admitted three counts of failing to notify authorities of a change in circumstances, looked stunned as he was sentenced to eleven months in jail.

Sentencing him, Judge Michael Leeming told him: 'It will take 341 months to clear the amount over 28 years. You will be 99, presuming you make it that far, before it's paid off.

'You are a benefits cheat. You know it, your family who remain supportive of you know it, and when this case is reported, your friends and neighbours and the wider public will know it too, and rightly so.

'These offences are easy to commit and difficult and time-consuming to detect.

'Thousands of people in this country claim benefits legitimately - you point the finger of suspicion at them through your activities.'
