2015 is the year of friendship between books and films, with Australians flocking to bookstores to purchase novels which have been transformed into blockbusters.

In a trend which has escalated in recent years, book publishers are now more likely to release a film tie-in edition of novels to coincide with movie releases.

Dymocks’ National Buying Manager Sophie Higgins said that the enduring power of celebrity and film can have an enormous influence on book sales, which almost always increase when they hit the cinema. 

50 Shades of Grey has sold 65 million copies worldwide and is in the top ten bestseller list for 2015

E.L. James’ bestselling Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, which include Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, is certainly no exception to this, creeping into the top ten bestseller list in January.

The book occupied the number one bestseller spot for 21 weeks in 2012, selling 65 million copies worldwide, and has now seen a renewed interest due to a film tie-in which is set to premiere on February 12.

'Fifty Shades of Grey was a bestseller for so long I can’t quite believe there are still people left in Australia who haven’t read the thrilling love affair of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele!' said Ms Higgins.

According to Ms Higgins, approximately one in ten Australians own or have read the first book, with more showing interest each day as the film premiers draws near.

'It's intriguing how the film will bring the characters to life, which helps with conversations around the book,' Ms Higgins said.

'Some women seem to be having fun with it around Valentines Day, and from what I can pick up are going to see the movie with their girlfriends instead of having a traditional celebration,' she said.

The enduring power of film to reach a broader audience than may have originally been reached with the books first release.

Eight of the top 10 bestselling titles at Dymocks were film tie-ins, with Gone Girl or American Sniper holding the number one spot for all of 2015.

'Films based on non-fiction books such as American Sniper and Unbroken give a broad overview of the story, but the books give so much more detail,' Ms Higgins said.

Ms Higgins said that rather than books and films competing against each other for audiences, they actually complemented each other.

Many non-fiction books allow for greater detail to be given than in the films

'A films release almost always renews interest in the book. Publishers didn't use to release film tie-ins, and the trend started with Twilight and used to be reserved for Young Adult books,' she said.

'Now, almost every single movie based on a book will get a new edition.'

Films also open up books which can seem to be niche stories to much wider interest through the actors involved in the productions.

'Wild, which stars Reese Witherspoon, can seem like one woman's story about her hike across America, but the film makes the book much more appealing and universal,' Ms Higgins said.

'Unbroken, which was directed by Angelina Jolie, received incredible publicity when she mentioned it was based on a true story,' she said.

Other novels which have been out for several years, such as Gone Girl and The Imitation Game, have also seen increased sales.

As different facets of the same story are highlighted through the differing mediums, films and books appear to be the perfect pairing for a new year of entertainment.
