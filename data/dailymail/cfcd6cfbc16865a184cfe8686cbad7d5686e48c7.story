Louis van Gaal could find himself in the away dugout at Scunthorpe United in a couple of weeks. 

Manchester United will on Wednesday evening find themselves in the draw for the Capital One Cup for the first time since 1995. 

Last season's disastrous showing means United, who are seeded for the draw, enter the competition a round earlier than normal and will be drawn to play an unseeded team - such as Shrewsbury Town, Crewe or Port Vale.
