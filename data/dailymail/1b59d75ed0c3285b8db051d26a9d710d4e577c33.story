Skirmish: The bears reportedly fought on August 14 in a Rockland, New Jersey neighborhood

Quarrel: The bears are believed to have been two bears fighting during mating season 

The bears are first seen in the clip fighting and growling in someone's yard - before they later tumble under some bushes and head toward the street.

The two animals go back to fighting on the sloping yard - and their tussle leads them to fighting in the street again. 

At one point, a car drives past the fray and lingers for several minutes before driving away.

The video of the encounter lasts almost six and a half minutes, and as of this writing has been viewed over 23,000 times.

Love triangle? Wildlife biologist Kelcey Burguess has said that bears' mating season runs through August, when the video was purportedly filmed 

Wildlife biologist Kelcey Burguess told NJ.com the bears caught on camera were probably both males.

He told the website 'They're probably fighting or playing because there’s a good-looking lady in the area,' referring to a female bear. 'It’s really common to have fights during mating season.'

He explained to NJ.com that bears' mating season runs through August.

He also said of bear fighting, 'It can be pretty vicious, but it’s normal behavior.'

Standoff: One bear lunged on top of his supposed rival during the fray
