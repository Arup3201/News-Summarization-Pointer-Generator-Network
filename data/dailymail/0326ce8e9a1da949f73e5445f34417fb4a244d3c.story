A young woman hanged herself after struggling to cope with the heartbreak of her mother committing suicide just nine months before, an inquest has heard.

Sarah Babic was so upset by the death of her mother Lorraine, who had suffered with multiple sclerosis for nearly 40 years, and being unable to see her own 10-year-old daughter that she took her own life.

The 31-year-old, of Thatcham, Berkshire,  had become increasingly unwell in the months leading up to her death and her weight had plummeted from 10 stone to just seven due to nausea and gallstones, the inquest heard.

The deputy coroner for Berkshire, based at Royal Berkshire Hospital  in Reading (pictured), heard that Sarah, had lost custody of her daughter from her previous marriage and had been unable to see her

Lorraine, 57, had battled her debilitating condition since the age of 20 but decided to 'take control of her life' by hanging herself in March 2013.

Sarah's father, Mike Babic, said in a statement: 'Her marriage breaking up and the loss of custody of her daughter hit her hard and the death of her mother also hit her hardest of all as they had been very close and (she was)Â  a great source of support to Sarah.'

Emma Jones, deputy coroner for Berkshire, heard that Sarah, had lost custody of her daughter from her previous marriage and had been unable to see her.

Her fiancee, Simon Key, whom she lived with, said: 'Sarah rarely talked about her daughter but her ex-husband and his new partner were quite difficult about her having contact.

'Sarah's father intervened and they worked out an agreement where she could phone her daughter every Sunday in October 2013. It worked well for a few weeks but fell apart when Sarah called but there was no response and this upset her,' he said in a statement.

'Nine months before her death she lost her mother. This had a massive effect on Sarah.'

The inquest, held in Newbury, Berkshire, heard that Sarah, who also has a younger sister Lizzy, had become unwell with gallstones and a hernia and had stopped eating normally, causing her weight to plummet.

The 31-year-old, who lives in Grenadier Gardens, Thatcham, Berkshire, had become increasingly unwell in the months leading up to her death and her weight had plummeted

An operation on her gallstones three weeks before her death had been successful but she reported still feeling sick during appointments with her doctor.

On December 27 she had been due to attend an emergency doctor's appointment arranged by her father at 4pm. Mr Key had left for work at HMV early that morning, with Sarah going to bed at 8.30pm the previous night due to her nausea.

He had checked on her at 11.30pm and saw her sleeping, the last time she was seen alive.

Mr Babic sent her a text message telling her to pack an overnight bag at 9.25am and she replied. Mr Key also sent her a message at 10.42am to see if she was alright but she did not reply.

When Mr Babic went to pick Sarah up at around 3.30pm she did not answer the door. He climbed in through an open downstairs window and discovered his daughter hanging.

Despite attempts by Mr Babic and paramedics to revive her, Sarah was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.

Thames Valley Police investigated the death but found no third party involvement. No suicide notes were recovered from the house.

Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl, Home Office pathologist, found that Sarah was 'slightly built but adequately nourished' at the time of her death. He concluded she had died from hanging.

Mr Key told the inquest: 'After her mother died she made a passing comment about having suicidal thoughts but that was the only mention she ever made of it.

'I loved her to bits and I still do. She was everything to me and has left a huge gap in my life.'

Mr Babic said his daughter had suffered from depression since the age of 18 years and had been on medication. She had attempted to kill herself with an overdose eight years before and had occasionally self-harmed.

'Sarah had initially responded fairly well after my wife's passing away and she was very supportive,' he said.

'We enjoyed some nice times over the summer and had a nice holiday in Ireland in July. It was my plan when I made the emergency appointment to get her into hospital to have treatment (for her sickness) but she beat me to it.'

In recording a verdict of suicide, Mrs Jones said: 'The recent death of her mother appeared to have affected Sarah greatly and the lack of contact with her own child was hard for her.'

Speaking after the inquest, Mr Babic, an operations manager at Mixing Solutions in Hambridge Lane, Newbury, reiterated how close his wife and daughter had been.

'We are in the process of laying Sarah to rest in a plot next to her mother,' he said. 'She is reunited with her mother.'
