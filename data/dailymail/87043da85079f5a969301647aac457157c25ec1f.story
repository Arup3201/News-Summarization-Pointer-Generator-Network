A teacher who was violently assaulted by a pupil when he tried to confiscate their mobile phone is not ready to return to work, union bosses claim.

The 16-year-old high school student at John F. Kennedy High School in Paterson, New Jersey, is facing jail time after the shocking attack on his  physics teacher that was captured on video.

The footage shows him slamming the 62-year-old to the ground in front of other students after being asked for his phone at the end of class.

Doctors have cleared the teacher to go back to work, but president of the Paterson Education Association, the teachers union Peter Tirri disagreed.

He told CBS New York: 'He said he had injuries to his hand, his lower back, his head and his shoulder.

'I want his doctors to clear him rather than the district itself,' Mr Tirri said. 'He was not in any shape even yesterday to go back to work.' 

The association is now planning to file a grievance about the incident and Mr Tirri will be meeting with the superintendent.

Security guards were called to the incident, the boy was suspended from school and later arrested at home on third-degree aggravated assault charges. 

David Cozart, the school's principal of operations, said that the boy became irate after his teacher took the cellphone from him.

In the 23-second clip posted to YouTube, the student can be seen wrestling with the teacher who tried to carry on with his lesson as the boy grabs him around his waist and slams him into a desk.

Other students can be heard shouting for the student to 'stop' and 'chill' but none tried to physically stop him during the assault.

Some were seen moving away from the scene saying 'I'm out, I'm out' and others hollered for the security saying 'Someone help him'!

Lee McNulty, a retired JFK teacher told NorthJersey.com: 'What strikes me is that the teacher never even defended himself, that just shows how much teachers are afraid of losing their job.'

Police have not released the names of the suspect or the teacher.

'This was a very upsetting incident and certainly one that we took seriously as the safety of our students and staff is our top priority,' school spokesperson Terry Corallo said in a statement.

Mr Tirri added that he was 'disappointed' that other students didn't try to help the teacher.

'Maybe they were afraid, I don't know,' he said.

Jonathan Hodges, a veteran school board member told the site: 'It's troubling that in our society today students think that inside a school they can put their hands on each other and teachers.'

'I went online trying to find this video and I found numerous videos of teachers being attacked by their students.' 

The student will be home schooled during his suspension.

A disciplinary hearing will reportedly determine his status for the remainder of the school year.
