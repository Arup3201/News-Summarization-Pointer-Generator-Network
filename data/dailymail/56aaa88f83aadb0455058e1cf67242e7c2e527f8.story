They may be representing their country in London, but broadcasters back home can't help but call out the U.S. gymnastics team for - of all things - their choice in leotards.

During a segment on the Fox News' America Live, host Alisyn Camerota could not help but ask the question why the gold medal-winning squad would don hot pink instead of red, white and blue.

Referring to the gold medal achievement of team member Gabby Douglas last week, Camerota said: 'Gabby had that great moment, everybody was so excited and she’s in hot pink.'

Pretty in pink: The U.S. women's gymnastics team, led by Gabby Douglas, became the subject of critique when Fox News called their nationalism into question after they wore pink in competition

Dress debate: Saying that how Douglas dresses is 'her prerogative,' America Live host Alisyn Camerota, left, invited her guest, radio host David Webb, right, to weigh in

Though she added that how Douglas dresses is ‘her prerogative,’ Camerota invited her guest, radio host David Webb, to weigh in.

Webb - who co-founded advocacy organisation Tea Party 365, said that the team’s dress is an example of a slight ‘anti-American feeling.'

‘What’s wrong with showing pride?’ he asked.

Pulling out a miniature American flag, Webb said: ‘Wear it. Wave it. Be proud to be an American. It’s not a political issue, but they make it a social issue.'

Star-spangled: The U.S. womens gymnastics team wore uniforms emblazoned with the American flag when they competed in the 1996 Atlanta games

Criticism: Webb, who co-founded advocacy organisation Tea Party 365, said that the team's dress is an example of a slight 'anti-American feeling'

Webb added: 'The Chinese are wearing red predominantly as that’s their national colour if you will. So why not us with the red white and blue? 

'There’s a meaning behind the red white and blue that’s been lost in time. The field of stars. You know, the blood that’s been shed... that’s what we need to focus on and get that out in our country.'

Perhaps the pink leotard is good luck, 
as the colour was also worn by Nastia Liukin, the all-around gold 
medallist in the 2008 Beijing games.

But in 1996, the women's gymnastics team, which dominated in the Atlanta games, wore white uniforms with an American flag streaked across the chest.

Controversial: The mother of U.S. gymnast Gabrielle Douglas, who won her second gold medal last week, has defended her daughter's hair, above, which has become a heated topic of debate

The critique of the gymnastics team's dress came as Douglas, 16, fended herself from a Twitter uproar over the way she styles her hair while she's competing.

She said yesterday that she was confused when she logged onto her computer after winning her second gold medal in three days to find that people were debating about her pulled-back look.

'I don't know where this is coming from. What's wrong with my hair?' said Douglas, the first U.S. gymnast to win gold in team and all-around competition. 'I'm like, "I just made history and people are focused on my hair?" It can be bald or short, it doesn't matter about [my] hair.'

Winner: The teenager, above, became the fourth straight American to win gymnastics' biggest prize

Douglas uses gel, clips and a ponytail holder to keep things in place while she competes, a style she's worn for years.

'Nothing is going to change,' she 
said. 'I'm going to wear my hair like this during beam and bar finals. 
You might as well just stop talking about it.'

Critics
have argued that her dark locks should in fact mimic the tight, 
ballerina-style bun that gymnasts usually tuck their hair into.

'I don't think people should be 
worried about that,' she said. 'We're all champions and we're all 
winners. I just say that it's kind of, a stupid and crazy thought to 
think about my hair.'

The bubbly teenager was the first 
African-American gymnast to win her sport's biggest prize.

Not a fan: One user, above, took to the social networking site to announce his disapproval over her hair

She had no 
idea she was lighting up social media until she Googled herself hours 
after winning her gold medal.

In the Flying Squirrel's defense, her
hair had been kept securely in place with ample gel and hair clips as 
she has leaped and twirled her way to glory.

One user wrote on Twitter: 'Gabby Douglas gotta [sic] do something with this hair! These clips and this brown gel residue aint it!'.

Another posted: 'In Olympic news, why hasn't anyone tried to fix Gabby Douglas' hair?'.

To which a further user replied: 'That's an Olympic sport too!'.

The teenage superstar was also defended on Twitter by her supporters.

Critic: Another Twitter user, above, stated that fixing the teenager's hair would prove an Olympic sport itself

Support: Other users have defended the young athlete, as shown above. They believe the topic is nonsense

One
user wrote: 'People busy talking about Gabby Douglas not having her 
hair done?? She's busy sweating & WINNING GOLD MEDALS... you're on 
TWITTER. Right'.

Another 
person wrote: 'If you want to ride Gabby Douglas for her hair, you 
should be open to her coming over to critique your muscle tone'.

A
further user wrote: 'Gaby [sic] Douglas may not have her hair done, but
she accomplished something more than half of us didn't. Focus'.

Peculiarly, Miss Douglas' hair is possibly the neatest out of her whole team leading many to wonder what all the fuss is about.

Her teammates, Jordyn 
Wieber, McKayla Maroney, Alexandra Raisman and Kyla Ross, have each been
spotted with unruly strands of hair poking out of their buns and 
ponytails.

Defense: Another user, above, expressed expressed that critics should watch what they say
