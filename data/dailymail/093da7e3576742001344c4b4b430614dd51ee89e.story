The most powerful nuclear bomb remaining in America’s arsenal was dismantled yesterday after nearly 50 years of service.

The B53 was capable of releasing nine megatons of energy – 600 times more than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.

On explosion, the 9,000lb ‘bunker buster’ would have caused lethal burns to anyone within 18 miles, destroyed all buildings within nine miles and was even able to penetrate up to 230m underground.

But the last one was taken apart yesterday at America’s only nuclear weapons facility, the Pantex plant near Amarillo in Texas.

The completion of the dismantling program is a year ahead of schedule, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration, and aligns with President Barack Obama's goal of reducing the number of nuclear weapons.

Thomas D'Agostino, the nuclear administration's chief, called the bomb's elimination a 'significant milestone'.

First put into service in 1962, when Cold War tensions peaked during the Cuban missile crisis, the B53 weighed 10,000lbs and was the size of a minivan. 

It was kept airborne on B52 bombers round the clock until 1968 as a nuclear deterrent against the Soviet Union.

The Hiroshima bomb, nicknamed 'Little Boy', released a mix of shockwaves, heat rays and radiation, killing thousands instantly.

Around 600 to 860 milligrams of matter in the bomb was converted into the active energy of heat and radiation. It exploded with an energy between 13 and 18 kilotons of TNT.

In comparison, the B53 had 9,000 kilotons of explosives on board.

According to figures published in 1945, 66,000 people were killed as a direct result of the Hiroshima blast, and 69,000 were injured.

By
 the end of 1945, the death toll had risen to some 140,000 out of an 
estimated population of 350,000. Thousands more died of illness and 
injuries later.

Three 
days after the Hiroshima attack, on August 9, 1945, the United States 
dropped a second nuclear bomb on the city of Nagasaki in southern Japan.

Japan surrendered six days later, ending the military aggression that 
brought it into World War Two.

'Its accuracy was horrendous,' he added.
 'It was one heck of a whopper.

'We have nothing that comes close to it 
in the stockpile anymore, and neither does Russia. It's the end of an 
era.'

The B53 was designed to destroy facilities deep underground, and it was carried by B-52 bombers.

Since it was made using older technology by engineers who have since retired or died, developing a disassembly process took time.

Engineers had to develop complex tools and new procedures to ensure safety.

'We knew going in that this was going to be a challenging project, and we put together an outstanding team with all of our partners to develop a way to achieve this objective safely and efficiently,' said John Woolery, the plant's general manager.

Despite being hugely destructive, the 9,000 kiloton B53 was by no means the most deadly nuclear weapon America has built.

Between 1945 and 1990, more than 70,000 total warheads were developed, in over 65 different varieties, ranging in yield from around .01 kilotons to the 25 megaton B41 bomb.

Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 the U.S. has been steadily reducing its stockpile.

In April last year, President Barack Obama signed a historic treaty with Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev to reduce the number of nuclear weapons deployed by the former Cold War enemies.

The landmark agreement in the Czech capital Prague committed the superpowers to reducing the number of strategic warheads to 1,550 each - 30 per cent lower than the previous cap.

It also limited the number of deployed launchers - ballistic missiles and heavy bombers - to 700 each.

Many of the B53s were disassembled in the 1980s, but a significant number remained in the U.S. arsenal until they were retired from the stockpile in 1997.

Pantex spokesman Greg Cunningham said he couldn't comment on how many of the bombs have been disassembled at the Texas plant.

The weapon is considered dismantled when the roughly 300lbs of high explosives inside are separated from the special nuclear material, known as the pit.

The uranium pits from bombs dismantled at Pantex will be stored on an interim basis at the plant, Cunningham said.

The material and components are then processed, which includes sanitising, recycling and disposal, the National Nuclear Security Administration said last autumn when it announced the Texas plant's role in the B53 dismantling.

The plant will play a large role in similar projects as older weapons are retired from the U.S.'s nuclear arsenal.
