Zara Phillips is one step closer to her dream of Olympic gold as she has qualified for the 2016 Games.

The Queen’s granddaughter jumped a perfect round at the Alltech GEI World Equestrian Games in Normandy, securing her place in Team GB for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.

Zara, 33, rode her bay gelding High Kingdom, with whom she won Olympic team silver two years ago.
