Texting with Google Glass is just as distracting and dangerous for drivers as using a smartphone.

Research has discovered that using the tech giant’s hands-free headset makes motorist delay slamming on their brakes to avoid a collision.

And this delay is similar to that caused when drivers use more traditional mobile devices.

A study carried out by the University of Central Florida asked 40 people in their 20s to drive in a car simulator. The participants were wearing using Google Glass (pictured), or using smartphones. Their reactions were recorded when a ‘vehicle’ ahead stalled

However, the Glass wearers were able to recover control of their cars faster and more effectively afterwards.

The study, carried out by the University of Central Florida, asked 40 people in their 20s to drive in a car simulator either using Glass or smartphones.

Their reactions were recorded when a ‘vehicle’ ahead stalled.

If you are sending a text, watching the TV or listening to the radio, you may want to stop and give this your full attention.

Multi-tasking shrinks the brain, research suggests.

A study by the University of Sussex found that men and women who frequently used several types of technology at the same time had less grey matter in a key part of the brain.

The finding follows research which has linked multi-tasking with a shortened attention span, depression, anxiety and lower grades at school. 

The researchers compared text-messaging participants’ reactions on each device to times when they were just driving without multitasking.

Psychologist Ben Sawyer, of the University of Central Florida, said: ‘Texting with either a smartphone or Glass will cause distraction and should be avoided while driving.

‘Glass did help drivers in our study recover more quickly than those texting on a smartphone. We hope Glass points the way to technology that can help deliver information with minimal risk.’

The research is the first scientific study to look at using Google Glass to text while driving.

Distracted motorists are a renowned menace, with research in the US showing mobile phone use leads to at least 1.6 million crashes a year.

With the emergence of Glass and competitors, several states are considering banning drivers from wearing those technologies.

Mr Sawyer added: ‘As distractive influences threaten to become more common and numerous in drivers’ lives, we find the limited benefits provided by Glass a hopeful sign of technological solutions to come.

Both activities caused motorists to delay slamming on their brakes, suggesting that the hands-free device was as distracting as texting. But Glass wearers returned to driving normally more quickly than those who were using the phone at the wheel (stock image pictured)

Google Glass gives drivers the option of using head movements and voice commands to view and respond to text messages, avoiding clumsy thumbs, texting with the technology still causes distraction. But, the researchers state it should not be used as a replacement for phones

‘While Glass using drivers demonstrated some areas of improved performance in recovering from the brake event, the device did not improve their response to the event itself.

‘More importantly, for every measure we recorded, messaging with either device negatively impacted driving performance.

‘Compared to those just driving, multitaskers reacted more slowly, preserved less headway during the brake event, and subsequently adopted greater following distances.’

While Glass gives drivers the option of using head movements and voice commands to view and respond to text messages, avoiding clumsy thumbs, texting with the technology still causes distraction.

He said the bottom line was not to trade a smartphone in for Google Glass in the belief it will make texting safer behind the wheel because it will not, at least for now.
