Investors burned by Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme could be getting back more of their money.

The trustee in charge of recovering funds for Madoff's victims said Monday he is asking a New York bankruptcy court for permission to distribute another $322 million.

This as 55% of the billions lost by Madoff has now been recovered.

Payback: Bernie Madoff's trustee is set to return another $322million to duped investors as 55% of the $20billion lost by disgraced money man has now been recovered

Trustee Irving Picard said that if approved, the latest payment would bring the total distributed so far to Madoff investors to $7.2 billion.

Madoff's multi-decade fraud lost about $20 billion from thousands of investors. His firm told clients they were gaining steady returns when in fact Madoff was using money from new investors to distribute funds to existing clients while financing a lavish lifestyle for him.

Picard, appointed after Madoff's scheme collapsed in 2008, has recovered about $10.5 billion.

A hearing is scheduled for January on whether to approve the latest distribution, which would send payments to about 1,000 Madoff investors. The smallest proposed payout is $391, the largest, almost $61 million.

The process for returning the recovered funds has been arduous, with victims filing lawsuits and other complaints over how Picard has chosen to distribute the money.

Madoff, 76, pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges in March 2009 and is serving a 150-year prison sentence.

Going away: Annette Bongiorno, who worked for Madoff from the 1960s until the firm's collapse in 2008, was the second of five former employees to be sentenced after being convicted in March of securities fraud

This comes just two weeks after a former manager at Bernard Madoff's firm was sentenced to six years in prison today in New York for helping the convicted fraudster carry out a Ponzi scheme that caused investors to lose billions of dollars.

Annette Bongiorno, who worked for Madoff from the 1960s until the firm's collapse in 2008, was the second of five former employees to be sentenced after being convicted in March of securities fraud, conspiracy and other charges in a Manhattan federal court.
