A respected teacher who was sacked for drunkenness was today jailed for a boozy jaunt in a luxury Range Rover.

Darren McCarthy, 39, of Walthamstow, London, was arrested after driving a friend’s £50,000 car in a drunken haze just moments after being found by police lying asleep and snoring on a pavement.

He was said to be abusive to officers and refused to give a breath test when asked.

Disgraced: Darren McCarthy leaving Macclesfield Magistrates Court in handcuffs. He was sentenced to eight weeks in prison for failure to provide an evidential sample of breath.

Earlier this year McCarthy was dismissed from his job as a PE teacher at a school for children with behavioural problems after going on a boozing binge with the headmistress, during which he kissed and embraced her before they had a drunken bust-up inside a railway station.

The father-of-two from Walthamstow, London has since been struggling to find work.

At Macclesfield magistrates' court in Cheshire McCarthy looked shocked as he was jailed for ten weeks after admitting failing to provide a specimen of breath.

He was also banned from driving for 30 months. His lawyer said he would appeal.

The latest incident occurred at 3.25am on August 25 after McCarthy, who used to work at Barking and Dagenham Tuition Centre in Essex, had spent the night drinking while visiting a friend in the wealthy Cheshire village of Alderley Edge.

Paul Davies, prosecuting, said police patrolmen spotted him lying on the floor outside the Natwest cash machine and went to tend to him because they were concerned for his welfare.

'He was snoring loudly and his phone and car keys and wallet had fallen out of his pocket,' said Mr Davies.

Guilty: McCarthy outise court. He had previously been fired for a drunken altercation with headteacher Katrina Mann (right)

'He was taken by the shoulders and became conscious and the officers detected intoxicants and that he appeared to be drunk.

'Upon waking he was quite abusive towards the police officers and staggered off but returned when he realised his property had fallen out of his pocket. He collected the items without saying anything further.'

Shortly afterwards the same officers saw a Range Rover Sport turn out towards them and spotted McCarthy at the wheel.

'Mr McCarthy was shocked when he was stopped and realised the officers were the same ones as before and said "I refuse" when asked to take a sample,' said Mr Davies.

'They consequently explained but he refused and he was arrested and he became very aggressive and argumentative.'

The court heard McCarthy was in breach of a conditional discharge after being convicted of disorderly behavior following his bust up with the Katrina Mann, 48, outside Barking railway station in March.

He was also in breach of a further conditional discharge for a separate offence of obstructing police. He also had a caution for common assault in 2007.

Defending, Naomi Roberts said: 'He accepts that his recollection of this incident is hazy. He was staying at a friend’s house in Alderley Edge and had use of his vehicle.

'He drove to meet some friends and went into the bars and had a few drinks but had no intention of driving the vehicle. He took a taxi to Wilmslow and continued drinking and remembers going back to the address and falling asleep on the sofa and cannot remember anything else.

'He doesn’t have a good relationship with the police following incidents from earlier this year, but he accepts in hindsight that he should have provided a sample.'

She added: 'He was a PE teacher and has been in the profession for 14 years but an incident at the beginning of this year led him to lose his job as a teacher, which had a profound affect on him.

'He went from having a well-respected profession to now actively seeking work. He was teaching pupils who were underprivileged and disadvantaged and they would look up to him and he was their role model.

'He knows he has let them down and also his family and friends and those who he has built up a relationship with. He wants to get back into teaching.

'Mr McCarthy accepts that he needs to make a change and fully accepts that and knows he has put himself in a very precarious position. He is fully remorseful for his actions.'

But passing sentence chairman of the bench Mrs Monica Sim said: 'You were intoxicated and gave numerous refusals both at the roadside and in the custodial suite. This was an intentional refusal and you presented a very high risk to road users and pedestrians.

'We feel that this particular offence is enough to warrant a custodial sentence in order to punish, detract and deter others from this particular offence.'

Last March McCarthy was in court after he got involved in a drunken row with Ms Mann.

Witnesses called the police as the couple shouted and swore at each other. McCarthy yelled at officers, screaming 'why are you f***ing stopping me’' and saying they were only stopping him because he was a 'n*****.' while Mann retorted: 'Shut the f*** up, you p****, don’t say anything - you’re coming home with me.'

It emerged they had been drinking at a nearby bar for more than six hours.

The Barking and Dagenham Tuition Centre has been praised by Ofsted for being ‘extremely successful’ at getting previously disaffected students back into education.
