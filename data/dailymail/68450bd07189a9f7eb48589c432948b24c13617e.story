A man has been charged with paedophilia offences in the US after Australian officials found disturbing images on the phone of a passenger who was flying out of Sydney airport.

Airport staff found pictures of a 10-year-old boy being abused in Arizona alongside online chat messages - and immediately alerted the Phoenix Police Department.

US police then swooped on an apartment belonging to Edwin Collison, 35, and charged him with a series of child sex abuse offences.

Another man was detained by police at Sydney airport when his phone was found to have pornographic photographs of a 10-year-old. The photos were then linked back to Edwin Collison

They allegedly found more than 10,000 chat messages and images of children being sexually abused, including the 10-year-old boy, when they arrested Collison at his apartment in a complex popular with young families and next to a school.

Collison, who used the screen names 4EV4RURFREAK and COOL AZ GUN, took explicit photos of the 10-year-old and sent them on to other paedophiles around the world via kik chat and Skype, police claim.

Collison also allegedly chatted about wanting to touch the 10-year-old's friend. He is charged with nine counts of sexual exploitation of a minor, five counts of child molestation and two counts of sexual conduct with a minor.

The Australian Federal Police refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia and would not say if the passenger in Sydney was arrested or stopped from travelling.
