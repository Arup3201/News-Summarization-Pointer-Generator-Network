Tom Goodman-Hill was still married when he started a relationship with Jessica Raine

As prim and proper midwife Jenny Lee, she spends her days dealing with her patients’  family dramas.

But off-screen, it seems actress Jessica Raine has plenty of her own complications to deal with.

The Daily Mail can reveal that the Call The Midwife star met her partner, actor Tom Goodman-Hill, while he was apparently happily married.

Months later the 44-year-old suddenly left his wife and two children, before embarking on a relationship and later setting up home with Miss Raine, 30.

In fact, he had already arranged and sent out invitations for a surprise 40th birthday party for his wife, Kerry Bradley, when he dramatically cancelled everything and announced their 20-year relationship was over.

Mr Goodman-Hill, who is currently playing a middle-aged adulterer in ITV period drama Mr Selfridge, now lives with Miss Raine in a love nest ten minutes away from his estranged wife and their teenage children.

The divorce is yet to be finalised, and he continues to pay more than £20,000 a year in private school fees.

Miss Bradley, now 42, has told friends of her deep shock over being dumped so suddenly – and anger at her errant husband and his new younger woman.

She has also commented on the irony that Mr Goodman-Hill met Miss Raine when they starred in a National Theatre play about children being let down by older generations.

The fateful show was Earthquakes In London, which opened to rave reviews in August 2010. It featured Mr Goodman-Hill as an anguished husband going through a mid-life crisis as his marriage falls apart, while Miss Raine plays a hedonistic young student enjoying a ‘whirlwind of sex’, who even danced topless on stage.

One scene featured ‘a splendidly spunky Jessica Raine’, as one review described her, dancing provocatively in front of her future lover with ripped tights and her bra showing as she waggled her skin-tight hotpants inches from his face.

In photographs of the scene Mr Goodman-Hill seems almost oblivious to her beauty – but later he evidently could not get her out of his mind.

Three months afterwards  he was arranging a surprise 40th for his wife at the Rivoli Ballroom in Brockley, South East London, where they had married a few years earlier, when  he horrified all their friends and family by cancelling at the last minute.

Telling everyone the party was off, he admitted his marriage was over, saying ‘It’s all my fault’. A friend said: ‘We were appalled to hear that Tom was leaving. In the end he was pretty unceremonious about going.

‘Everyone assumed they were so in love – and that’s clearly what he wanted everyone to think when he began arranging Kerry’s surprise birthday party. Kerry has been very brave, but two years later she’s still recovering. She’s furious not just at Tom but at Jessica too for being with her husband, and now getting to know her kids too.

‘And she can’t help observing the irony of how Tom first met Jessica – when he was playing a husband having a mid-life crisis, and Jessica was playing a wild young temptress.’

Miss Bradley works as a set designer for plays and television shows, including Footballers’ Wives, and is also a college lecturer.

She continues to live in the marital home in West Norwood, South London, a £500,000 four-bedroom Edwardian terrace which she owns jointly with Mr Goodman-Hill.

The long-term couple married in 2005.

Miss Bradley was too upset to comment. Last night Miss Raine’s agent Kate Bryden said: ‘Jess and Tom worked together on Earthquakes in 2010, he separated from his wife the same year, and he and Jess are now a couple.

‘Tom and Jessica did not get together until well after he and his wife were separated.’

Mr Goodman-Hill declined to comment. Miss Raine has won praise for her starring role in Call The Midwife, her first major television part. Recently, describing her life with Mr Goodman-Hill, former comprehensive schoolgirl and Rada graduate Miss Raine has said – without naming him – that they had been together for ‘a couple of years’.

She added that he was an actor who works ‘in theatre, television and film. We are both working in London at the moment so that’s great, but I like not having a routine because it keeps our relationship fresh and exciting.

‘I am not massively interested in getting married, to be honest – we live together and that’s fine.’
