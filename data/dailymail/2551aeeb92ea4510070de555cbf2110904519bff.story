The investigation into the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal is to be widened amid claims he targeted patients at more hospitals than first thought.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today revealed new evidence has come to light beyond the NHS institutions already being examined.

It suggests the disgraced former BBC presenter’s abuse of children on NHS premises may have been more regular and more serious than those offences committed at the Corporation.

Inquiry: The scale of abuse by former BBC presenter Jimmy Savile could go further than the 13 NHS institutions already under investigation

Savile was believed to have committed offences at 13 hospitals. Investigations were launched into activities at Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General Infirmary following the abuse revelations last year, along with inquiries at 10 other trusts.

But in an update to Parliament, Mr Hunt said more evidence has now emerged suggesting he abused patients at more hospitals.

New information has come to light relating to the existing investigations across 13 institutions as well as ‘reference to other hospitals’, the Health Secretary said.

Mr Hunt said any hospitals involved would be named once the review of the new potential evidence had been completed.

‘We understand the material includes information about hospitals where investigations are already under way and reference to other hospitals,’ he said in a statement to Parliament

‘Once this review is complete, the information will be passed on to the relevant trusts or investigations as quickly as possible.’

Leeds General Hospital is one of three hospitals where inquiries are under way into Jimmy Savile's crimes

The final reports of the current investigations are now expected to be finished by next June.

He added: ‘Although all 13 investigations are currently on track, this additional material means that the timetable will be affected.

‘It is vital that the final NHS investigation reports are thorough and complete and reflect all the evidence about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending.’

In June Liz Dux,  one of the lawyers representing his victims, said Savile's offences on NHS property were just as bad as those committed on the BBC premises and in some cases much worse.

Dux, of Slater & Gordon, added that more people in the NHS than previously thought knew about what was happening and took no action.

She said one victim had been assaulted 
while lying on a hospital trolley going to have an x-ray, and another 
was passing in a wheelchair when she was attacked.
