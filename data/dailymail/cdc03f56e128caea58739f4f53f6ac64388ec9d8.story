A top Houston public school has become embroiled in a child grooming scandal after 4th grade students became pen-pals with a convicted child molester.

Parents of two children at Trinity Lutheran School filed a negligence lawsuit alleging that class teacher Laura Perry set her students up to write to Rickey Rae Rowlett, 55, who was convicted on March 22 for abusing a girl under 14.

The suit alleges that the Pastor of Trinity Lutheran School and Church, Michael Dorn, knew of and approved of Perry's pen-pal plan.

Furthermore, it is claimed that Rowlett, who is a friend of Perry's family was delivered the letters in jail by Perry's father hidden from prison staff in large gift packages.

Another claim in the lawsuit is that Perry's husband Blake was in contact with his wife's students as a soccer coach, even though he is charged with possessing child pornography by Harris County in Texas.

While Laura Perry no longer works at the school and the principal Ann Boatman is on administrative leave, questions are being asked as to who knew what and when.

The lawsuit alleges that the pen-pal project was Laura Perry's idea and that she allegedly told students that Rowlett was falsely accused.

'The children were told by Laura Perry that Rickey Rea Rowlett had kidnapped his grandchildren to keep them from harm by parents or others,' said the suit filed by the two unnamed parents.

'In reality, Rowlett had been accused of aggravated sexual assault.'

The project which began before Rowlett's March 22 conviction saw children offer up personal information to him.

To the top: Pastor Michael Dorn of Trinity Lutheran Church and School is accused of not acting fast enough to deal with convicted child molester Rowlett writing to nine and ten year old children

'Laura Perry had her children, as a project to obtain a grade in the classroom, participate in an open writing campaign with Rowlett by which the children would give their personal information to Rowlett and Rowlett would respond with warm and encouraging letters to the children, allowing Rowlett to establish a rapport with the children and establishing them as potential future victims of his and others,' claimed the lawsuit heard in Houston.

Before his conviction it is thought that Rowlett would have been in a position to share the children's information with other sex offenders.

'In the Comal County jail, all persons charged with child or sexual crimes were kept out of the general population, but were segregated together with contact and communications between them,' continued the parents complaint.

'The letters from these children, containing full names, ages and locations where the children could be found could, and upon information and belief were, distributed freely.'

Authorities found the letters as they were transferring Rowlett from one cell to another in the county jail on the day of his conviction.

Trinity Lutheran School is one of Houston's most sought after public schools

'It's very alarming,' said Comal County District Attorney Jennifer Tharp who first alerted parents at the school to the issue.

One mother of the dozen or so children who became pen-pals with Rowlett spoke toÂ Fox News in Houston about her shock.

'I have two little boys who now are very aware of how horrible adults can be,' said the mother who did not wish to be named.

'He uses words like, 'Whatz up' with a z. Looking at it makes me sick 
because I feel like it was conditioning all along to develop and endear 
himself to these children.'

The pen pal relationship which was established over a period of several months before being discovered is at the heart of the parents legal complaint.

It is claimed that school pastor Michael Dorn had a lax attitude towards child protection as he had been aware that Perry's wife, Blake was accused of owning child porn and was working with the children.

However, John Menke, chairman of the school's governing board, said that Blake Perry had not been near to the school since his indictment in Harris County.

The Perry's family friendship with Rowlett went as far as Larry Lanfried, Laura Perry's father, acting as a character witness in his molestation trial in New Braunfels.

Legal ramifications: Parents of two children who were pen-pals with Rowlett have filed a negligence lawsuit against Trinity Lutheran Church and School

'Trinity has allowed, in fact encouraged ... minor children to have contact and communication with a child molester and a person indicted for promotion of child pornography,' said the suit filed by attorney Charles H. Peckham.

'Trinity has approved and condoned the release of identification of minor children's information for distribution with the jail and prison systems.'

Countering the claims of negligence, Trinity Lutheran School was adamant it had done all it could have.

'We've hired a private investigator to find out exactly what happened and have enacted new security protocols and policies,' said John Menke Wednesday.

'There's a long history of churches corresponding with inmates.

'In this case, it was really poorly handled. We didn't have good information or know the type of charges pending.'
