The Church of Scientology has launched a full-scale assault on a new HBO documentary about the controversial religious sect, specifically targeting its Oscar-winning director and claiming that his late father - an acclaimed journalist - published CIA propaganda.

In more than 200 tweets, the church has tried to discredit Alex Gibney and his sources in 'Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief', which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month.

It has also issued a statement on the website of Freedom Magazine, its news publication, claiming the documentary is 'propaganda', 'one-sided', full of 'false information' and features 'vengeful' sources.

And a week before the premiere, it took out full-page ads in the New York Times and Los Angeles Times to smear the film, based on Lawrence Wright's 2013 award-winning book of the same name.

Now, in perhaps its most rigorous attempt to smear Gibney and his production, the church has released a video online, in which it discusses  the director's 'lies' and attempts to discredit his father.

Claims: The Church of Scientology has launched a full-scale assault on Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney (left) and his documentary, 'Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief'. In a newly-released video, the church claims Gibney's late father - acclaimed journalist, Frank Gibney (right) - published CIA propaganda

Angry: The church (file picture) has desperately tried to discredit  Gibney and his sources in the film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, last month. It claims the production is 'one-sided'

Accusations: In its video (pictured: a still from the footage), posted on YouTube, the church claims Frank Gibney 'was part of a covert CIA operation to release propaganda through book publishing and the media'

In the video, posted on YouTube on Thursday, it claims Frank Gibney,  who died aged 81 in 2006, 'was part of a covert CIA operation to release propaganda through book publishing and the media.'

'Apparently the apple doesn't fall far from the tree,' a female narrator intones, dryly, over images of the journalist, who was influential in post-World War II America as an interpreter of Japan and its culture.

In its argument, the church refers to a December 1977 New York Times story, which reported that Frank Gibney - an author and foreign correspondent who worked for the Chicago Daily News, Time, Newsweek and Life magazine - admitted that one of his books was written directly from CIA memos.

The book, The Penkovsky Paper, was about a Soviet spy who was executed in Russia after cooperating with the CIA. It was claimed at the time to be excerpted from Penkovsky's diary.

However, a Senate Intelligence Committee report found that the book had been 'published by the CIA' through Double Day, the Times reported.

The female narrator claims that director Gibney is similar to his late father in his distribution of 'textbook propaganda', which she says shows 'precious little legitimate investigation and fact-based reporting'.

Working together: 'Apparently the apple doesn't fall far from the tree,' a female narrator intones, dryly, referring to alleged 'propagandist' similarities between Aelx Gibney (left) and his father. Gibney's documentary is based on Lawrence Wright's *right) 2013 award-winning book of the same name

'Staged': The church accuses Gibney of using a 'fake' scene of ants crawling up a wall (pictured) to depict a church facility that former church member Marty Rathbun described in the film as a 'prison camp'

Director: On its Freedom Magazine website, the institution adds author Wright and Gibney (pictured) 'cherry-picked expelled, discredited former Scientologists who would help them advance their propaganda'

She adds that during the two years that Gibney was producing the film, which makes allegations about the church and blames high-profile members Tom Cruise and John Travolta for not exposing alleged abuses, he failed to contact the church - and ignored 14 requests to meet with members.

In his documentary, Gibney interviews former members of the sect, and raises questions about the treatment of Scientology members and the organization's nonprofit, tax-exempt status.

One ex-member says of  the church in the film: 'You take on a matrix of thought that's not your own.'

Other sources recount Cruise's marriage to fellow A-lister Nicole Kidman in detail in the film.

A former top church official claims that Cruise distanced himself from Scientology while married to Kidman, and alleges the church told him to 'facilitate the breakup' of the couple.

However, in its video, the church attempts to discredit Gibney's sources, specifically citing 'expelled' member, Marty Rathbun, who it claims now has 'deep-seated anger issues'.

On its Freedom Magazine website, the institution adds author Wright and Gibney 'cherry-picked expelled, discredited former Scientologists who would help them advance their propaganda'.

It also accuses Gibney of using a 'fake' scene of ants crawling up a wall to depict a church facility that Rathbun described in the film as a 'prison camp' - a 'buzz word' it claims was deliberately used.

Facility: In a bid to discredit the allegedly 'staged' ants scene, the church broadcasts an array of images of its California facility (pictured) in its video, including a 500-acre 'audio production facility' and a sound stage 'more than three stories tall and large enough to accommodate four professional basketball courts'

Homes: 'Yes this is the spot that Gibney portrays with ants crawling up a wall,' the narrator comments, before describing the homes (pictured) that the church's staff members live in, and their 'state-of-the-art' facilities

In a bid to discredit the allegedly 'staged' ants scene, the church broadcasts an array of images of its California facility in its video, including a 500-acre 'audio production facility' and a sound stage 'more than three stories tall and large enough to accommodate four professional basketball courts'.

'Yes this is the spot that Gibney portrays with ants crawling up a wall,' the narrator comments, before describing the homes that the church's staff members live in, and their 'state-of-the-art' facilities. 

These include a laundry room, a dining room, a communal pool and barbecue area, tennis courts, basketball courts, sand volleyball courts and a golf course, among other facilities, she said.

'Gibney couldn't have gotten it more wrong,' she concluded, describing it as a 'worker's paradise'. 

Author: Gibney said he had not been interested in the Church of Scientology before reading Wright's (above) book. The theme of the book Gibney says, explores 'how people become prisoners of faith in various ways'

In comments to the New York Times last month, Gibney admitted the film includes a little dramatic reconstruction, some of which harks back to Scientology's early days and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard.

But it also features scenes that were licensed, filmed in the public domain or adhered to the conditions of fair use, he said, adding he had not been interested in the sect before reading Wright's book.

He said he was immediately drawn to the book's underlying theme upon reading it. The theme, in Gibney's own words, explores 'how people become prisoners of faith in various ways'. 

The director added that he was confident of his documentary's solidity.

'Going Clear' was screened to a packed crowd in Park City, Utah, on January 25. It  attracted so many festival-goers that many were forced to stand outside in the cold.

Gibney won an Academy Award in 2008 for best documentary feature for his film 'Taxi To the Dark Side.' He was also nominated in 2006 for 'Enron: the Smartest Guys in the Room.'

He is also known for 2013's 'The Armstrong Lie,' about disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong.

DailyMail.com has contacted the Church of Scientology, HBO and Mr Gibney's representatives for comment.
