This feels like a homecoming to Kenny Miller. His heart had long been set on a return to Rangers. Pretty much, it seems, from the moment he left in 2011.

For all that longing, Miller could never have imagined what would happen to the club between his second and third spells as an employee.

The bitter experience of administration and slumping to the foot of the league ladder has been followed by almost incessant turmoil off the field. Even now, with the club just one step short of climbing back into the top flight, uncertainty still lingers.

Homecoming: Kenny Miller has returned to Rangers after penning a one-year deal

The club’s board and a section of its support have spent the summer at loggerheads over season-ticket renewals, with the exact uptake yet to be made public. The financial situation is regarded by most as fragile yet that did not put off Miller in the slightest.

Even at 34, he would not have been short of other options - but Rangers was the only interest he pursued.

Insisting he did not seek any assurances over the club’s future, Miller’s only concern is what could happen on the field of play as Ally McCoist’s side seek to gain promotion from the Championship.

‘I’ve not sought anything,’ he said. ‘I’m here to play football. If things happen off the field then I’m sure I’ll have to deal with it like everybody else at the club when that happens, but hopefully it won’t.

‘Hopefully, we won’t get back to the situation we have found ourselves in before. For me, I wanted to come back to this club to play football, pull that jersey on and get out in that stadium in front of these fantastic fans again. I am fortunate enough to have that opportunity.

‘Any time I meet anyone and speak about Rangers it’s always, one,  am I coming back? And, two, they would like to see me back here.

‘The chat has always been about football and not what’s happened off the field or what’s going to happen off the field.

‘It’s all been about getting this club back to where it belongs, which is challenging at the top.’

Asked if the speculation about Rangers’ off-field health might dissuade other players, he added: ‘That’s every footballer’s prerogative but it was never an issue for me. I wanted to come back no matter what’s gone on.

Feeling at home: Miller is back for a third spell at Ibrox

‘I want to play for this football club and I’m just delighted that it’s done now. If anyone else has reservations then that’s up to them.’

For Miller, signing his contract earlier this week completed ‘a long, long process of trying to come back’, after previous possibilities were wrecked by a whole variety of circumstances.

The question now is whether he will be the only Ibrox old boy to return this summer. McCoist is also thought to be keen on Kris Boyd, out of contract at Kilmarnock and attracting interest from both Aberdeen and Dundee United.

It remains to be seen whether a deal for the 30-year-old can come to fruition, but Miller would be more than happy to renew their previous partnership.

‘I think Kris would excite everyone, when you see what he brought to the club in the four-and-a-half years he was here,’ said Miller. ‘He scored an incredible amount of goals.

‘That’s what he does. Last season he scored 22 league goals for a struggling Kilmarnock team, which is phenomenal.

‘I’ve spoken to Kris and I think that, if the opportunity was there, it’s something he would be interested in.

‘Personally, I’m just happy to be here and I’d like to thank the chief executive and the manager for giving me that chance.

Back where he belongs: Miller has returned to Scotland from a spell in Canada with Vancouver Whitecaps

‘Whoever comes in or whoever I’m asked to play alongside up front, I’ll be delighted to do it. Just pulling on that jersey again will be enough but if the big man comes back he will definitely be an asset for the club.’

Pulling on a darker blue shirt again remains unlikely. Miller retired from Scotland duty last year to concentrate on his club career with Vancouver Whitecaps and to limit the number of draining transatlantic flights. Those travel concerns are no longer present, but he feels Gordon Strachan has plenty of more youthful options to spearhead a push for Euro 2016 qualification.

‘You’re spot-on that my decision to stop playing for the national team was largely down to those flights,’ admitted Miller, capped 69 times.

‘It was hard for me to do that travelling and still perform at optimum levels for my country, and also to go back to Canada or the States and then be fully fit to play for my club the following Saturday.

‘That was really tough and, ultimately, it was a big part of my decision. Now that I’m back I’ve no thoughts about coming out of that retirement and making myself available for selection.

‘Scotland’s results in the last year have been excellent and I hope that we continue to make progress under Gordon Strachan.

‘We have a lot of fantastic younger boys available to play in my position and I’m sure we have more than enough to make sure that we’re challenging for a place at Euro 2016.’

His focus will, therefore, be on a demanding domestic challenge with Rangers pitched in alongside Hearts and Hibs in a second tier unlike any other in the past.

Club before country: Miller has no plans to come out of retirement and add to his 69 caps for Scotland

Miller is confident that it will bring the best out of the existing Ibrox squad. How long it will take for the club to be restored to the top flight-winning force he once knew is a different question.

‘Who knows?’ said Miller. ‘The first aim this year is to win this league and get back into the top flight.

‘After that, we know what this club’s about - winning trophies. There is not going to be any thinking that we’ve got a couple of years to get back in contention.

‘We need to be challenging straight away, it’s as simple as that. That’s what the players will be looking to do.

‘How long it will take, who knows? But I know for a fact that if I am here next year and we are in the top flight, there’s no way I will be settling for second best.’
