Didier Drogba is known to hold a lot of influence in the Chelsea dressing room, and the returning Ivorian has flexed his muscles again by claiming back his old squad number.

Oscar has worn the No 11 shirt since joining in 2012 - the year Drogba departed - but has allowed the striker to pull rank and take his preferred shirt number back.

The squad number clearly means a lot to Drogba, and he took to Instagram to express his gratitude. He wrote: 'Back to my favourite shirt number 11. Thanks to oscar_emboaba for this privilege!!! #avecclasse #whynot #trueblues #cfc.'

Thank you kindly: Didier Drogba took to Instagram to thank Oscar for letting him take back his No 11 shirt

Time for a switch: Drogba put this picture up on Instagram accompanied by his message of thanks

The change means Oscar will take the No 8 shirt that was worn by legendary midfielder Frank Lampard, and the Brazilian is looking forward to the challenge of emulating the veteran.

'Didier is a Chelsea legend and a senior player. I am happy for him to take the 11 and for me to take the 8,' Oscar told the club's official website. 'Lamps is another legend at this club and I hope I will be as successful in the shirt as he was.'

He later posted a picture of his new shirt number along with the message: 'So, @didierdrogba will wear number 11 and I am going to the number 8. #ComeOnChelsea'

Drogba said: ‘I am very pleased to be able to return to the number 11 shirt and I am very grateful to Oscar for allowing me to make this change.’

Elsewhere in the squad, Thibaut Courtois is handed the No 13 jersey, with Petr Cech keeping his No 1 shirt.

Eden Hazard is Chelsea's new No 10, replacing Juan Mata who  left to join Manchester United, and Victor Moses switches to the No 18 shirt previously worn by Romelu Lukaku.

Taking a tumble: Oscar goes down injured in pre-season but should be fit for the start of the new campaign 

As a gesture of goodwill, Chelsea are allowing fans who have bought shirts with the old names and numbers on the back to exchange them at the club's shop. 

All returned shirts will be donated to the Chelsea Foundation, the club's charity organisation which attempts to use sport to bring about positive changes in people's lives and their communities.
