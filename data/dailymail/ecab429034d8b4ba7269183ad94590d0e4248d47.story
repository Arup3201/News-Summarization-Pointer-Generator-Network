Two weeks’ worth of rain is expected to soak the country in just one hour today as a flaming June turns into a summer washout.

A string of flood alerts have been issued with thunderstorms predicted to bring torrential downpours. More than an inch of rain is likely to fall in some areas.

Despite the deluge, temperatures are predicted to stay high, with a maximum of 24C (75F) in London and the South, with high humidity making it feel even hotter.

Despite bright sunshine across the country today, the UK faces a summer soaking tomorrow and severe weather warnings have been issued amid fears of flooding. Two-year-old twins Katie and Jessica Bland made the most of the sunshine with friend Corey, one, on South Shields beach today

Temperatures could reach 25C today ahead of the heavy rain which will hit first thing tomorrow morning. Pictured: Horses enjoy the sunshine in a buttercup field in Biggin Hill, Kent

The Met Office said widespread thundery rain is expected to start falling early tomorrow morning, with showers unlikely to ease off until later in the evening

Temperatures were expected to reach up to 25C in London today, where dozens of people took to Green Park to catch a few rays

The Met Office said thundery rain is expected to start falling across Britain early tomorrow morning, with showers unlikely to ease off until the evening. However, many people took to London's parks today to enjoy the calm before the storm

Some places could see between 20mm and 30mm of rain fall in an hour tomorrow, which is almost half of the UK monthly average for the whole of June. It comes as people across the country enjoyed temperatures of up to 25C today

Many towns and cities across Britain have already suffered a soggy first half of 2014, with experts recording Reading, Berkshire, as having the wettest first five months of any year on record. Pictured: Londoners enjoyed the sunshine in Green Park this afternoon

The storms will hit southern England first and spread northwards, reaching Scotland and Northern Ireland by the afternoon.

Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said people should prepare for ‘pretty heavy’ rainstorms.

He
 added: ‘We are looking at the potential for some localised  flooding 
because we could see  so much rain fall in a short space  of time that 
it can’t drain away  fast enough.’

 University flooding expert Dr Hannah Cloke said: ‘We could see flash 
floods in some parts of Britain if rainfall this weekend is as intense 
as has been predicted.

‘The
 problem is likely to be exacerbated in areas where the ground is still 
wet from the winter floods, particularly in catchments with high 
groundwater levels and where rivers are still high following Britain’s 
wettest winter ever. But when it rains very heavily, almost anywhere 
could be at risk.

‘Extremely
 intense bursts of rain can mean that the soil is simply unable to soak 
up the water  fast enough, so excess water  runs off and causes floods 
in all sorts of unexpected places.’ Meteogroup forecaster John Lee said 
 the ‘heavy, thundery rain’ would spread up from the south today.

Rowan Storey and sisters Sarah and Bonnie Carruth celebrated the end of their summer exams by having some fun on the beach in the sunshine at South Shields

The Met Office said the mercury could rise as high as 25C today and tomorrow in London and the South East - not far short of the warmest temperature of the year so far

Tomorrow's downpours will ease by Sunday when there will be some 'good, dry and bright spells', particularly in southern and eastern parts of the country. Pictured: Amber and Alisha enjoy the sunshine at South Shields with two-year-old Teddy today ahead of the rain

Weather warnings for rain are already in place across most parts of the country including the north of England, the south west, south east, midlands, London, Scotland and Northern Ireland but it didn't stop some people, including Michelle Bayes and Margaret Bloodworth, from enjoying the sun at South Shields beach

‘Even
 though we are expecting pretty much everywhere to see some rain, 
potentially parts of  the Midlands and northern  England will get the 
heaviest blasts,’ he added.

Some
 places could see between 0.8in (20mm) and 1.2in (30mm) of rain fall in 
an hour – almost half of the UK monthly average for the whole of June of
 2.9in (73.4mm).The Met Office has issued yellow ‘be aware’ warnings for
 rain across almost all of England and Wales, and parts of Scotland and 
Northern Ireland.

The Environment Agency has issued nine flood alerts.

An
 EA spokesman said: ‘Heavy rain with isolated torrential downpours may 
bring some river and surface water flooding on Saturday across all of 
England, except for Devon and Cornwall, and all of Wales, except for 
Pembrokeshire.’

This turbulent weather is caused by warm, humid air from Europe hitting cooler air over the UK.

The predicted deluge is down to warm, humid air moving in from Europe which creates a risk of downpours when it mixes with cooler air over the UK. Pictured: Early morning swimmers enjoy the warm weather today at Peterborough Lido, Cambridgeshire

Despite warm weather in many parts of the country today, including at Peterborough Lido, Cambridgeshire (pictured), next week is likely to be 'slightly unsettled' with some dry and bright conditions along with light showers

In Cornwall, kayakers out for a paddle had an unexpected surprise when a pod of dolphins came within feet of them as they travelled along the Fowey River

Dolphins are regular visitors to the River Fowey but Karen Wells-West, who runs Encounter Cornwall with her partner David Johns, said it was incredible to see so many

Karen Wells-West said the pod of dolphins spotted in the River Fowey, Cornwall, today were very special. She said: 'It is unusual to see them that far up the river. They were just playing around the boats. It was very special'

In recent months, dolphins, basking sharks and barrel jellyfish have been spotted in huge numbers around the Cornish coast

Racegoers study the form in the bright sunshine at Epsom racecourse today where temperatures are expected to reach up to 25C

Some places could see between 20mm and 30mm of rain fall within an hour tomorrow morning but that didn't stop racegoers enjoying their day out at the Epsom Derby in Surrey today (pictured)

Mr
 Williams added: ‘It is going to be one of those warm but humid days 
where you could see some bright spells but also some heavy showers as 
well.’

He said the 
downpours will ease by Sunday when there will be some ‘good, dry and 
bright spells’, particularly in southern and eastern parts of the 
country and only a risk of light rain in some areas.

However, yet more rain is expected across the country on Monday, although it will be brighter between the heavy showers.

This is set to continue into next week, with some dry and bright conditions along with light showers, he added.

This year has already seen record bad weather, with the wettest winter in more than 100 years in January and February.

Unsurprisingly,
 scientists in Reading have recorded the wettest first five months of 
the year since  records began in 1908, when a total of 18inches (457mm) 
of rain fell on the Berkshire town between January and May this year.
