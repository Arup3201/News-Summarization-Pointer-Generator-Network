Dramatic footage of an RAF air display is believed to show the pilot killed in the Glasgow helicopter tragedy demonstrating his aviation prowess behind the controls of an army Chinook.

Former flight lieutenant David Traill, 51, was piloting a police helicopter when it crashed into the Clutha Vaults pub in Glasgow on Friday night, killing all on board and several people inside.

It has since emerged that Mr Traill was an experienced Chinook pilot who served in Afghanistan and Iraq before leaving the RAF to become a civilian pilot.

It is believed this dramatic footage uploaded on 
YouTube of the RAF Shoreham airshow in 2007 shows Mr Traill performing 
an impressive Chinook display, The Sun reports.

The massive twin propeller Chinook can be seen performing a string of tactical maneuvres in the air in front of an awe-struck crowd.

Flight Lieutenant Traill was captain of the RAF Chinook display team in 2007 and took part in airshows all over the country.

Mr Traill was an incredibly experience pilot who won medals for his bravey - even going on to teach new recruits how to fly.

It is even believed Mr Traill may have been one of Prince William’s flight instructors at the Hampshire base where the Duke of Cambridge learned how to fly five years ago.

It is not yet clear exactly what caused the police helicopter to drop 'like a stone' from the air on Friday night.

The wreckage is being removed so that it can undergo a detailed examination by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.

Mr Traill, from Lochwinnoch, leaves behind three devastated nephews who he cared for after their father died three years ago.

He regularly visited nephews David, Jamie and Max, who live with their mother Mary in Bathgate.

His family has paid tribute to the 'real-life hero' who loved to fly.

David Traill, 51, was a Chinook instructor at RAF Odiham where Prince William was taught

Cousin Toni Lawson, 25, said: ‘His younger brother Angus died three years ago from throat cancer, which knocked him for six.

‘Since then he’s helped raise his three young nephews.

'Their mum will have a hard time explaining to the boys what has happened to their uncle.

'They will be completely distraught about this.’

Miss Lawson added: ‘As long as I’ve been alive, he’s been flying helicopters. When he was in the RAF, he did tours of Iraq and Afghanistan.

'You name the country, and he was there. I think he got various medals for his bravery in the forces.

'He was a very experienced pilot and has always been a real hero in our family.’

Mr Traill retired from the RAF several years ago but continued to work as a civilian pilot.

He taught cadets how to fly Chinooks 
at RAF Odiham in 2007 and 2008 – the same time the Prince was at the 
base being taught how to fly the twin-rota machines.

Kensington
 Palace last night said officials were unable to get hold of the Prince 
to check, but it was ‘very possible’ that their paths had crossed during
 his military career.

A 
ninth body was found by emergency services on Sunday but only six have 
been removed because of the dangerous condition the pub is in.

DCC
 Rose Fitzpatrick said on Sunday: 'The site is extremely challenging and
 the efforts of colleagues from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and
 investigators have been painstaking.

'We
 can now confirm that Samuel McGhee died during the incident on Friday. 
Our thoughts are with his family and friends tonight as they are with 
all those affected by this tragedy.

Kensington Palace said it was 'very possible' that Prince William and David Trail may have met before

Devastation: Authorities fear more bodies may be trapped in the wreck of the pub after the helicopter crash while families wait for news

'Sadly I can also confirm the discovery of a further body within the site. This takes to nine the total number of people who died on Friday night.

'Our absolute priority has been to locate the bodies of people who were within the pub at the time of the incident and recover them safely.

'This process takes time, as formal identification procedures have to take place before we can notify relatives and publicly confirm identities.

'We are doing all we can to support the families of those who have lost loved ones. It is essential that we maintain sensitivity and dignity for the families of the deceased.'

The wreckage of the Eurocopter EC135 T2 will be transported to the headquarters of the Air Accident Investigation branch in Farnborough, Hampshire.

Aftermath: A helicopter rotor blade is lifted from the roof of the Clutha Vaults pub in Glasgow

The helicopter's rear rotor blade is lifted from the site on Sunday and the wreckage will be analysed
