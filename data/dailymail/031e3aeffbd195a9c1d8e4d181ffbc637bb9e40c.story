As if putting their hands in their pockets for a daughter’s wedding weren’t enough, ever more parents now put money towards their son’s as well.

The occasion has become so expensive that a fifth plan to pay for their son’s nuptials, and many more will make some contribution, research has shown.

A third pay for their daughter’s big day, according to a survey by Saga Home Insurance.

Rising costs: Parents are increasingly being tapped by their sons for help with paying for weddings

The average cost of a wedding rose above £21,000 this year. Previous research showed it had risen by £7,000 in a decade.

In 2003 the bill for the big day was £14,643, rising to £18,781 in 2006 and £19,265 in 2009.

People in their 20s and 30s simply cannot afford such a price tag given the economic climate so are being forced turn to the bank of mum and dad.

Paying for weddings also seems to run in the family.

Parents are more likely to cover the entire bill for their children if they didn’t have to pay for their own, the survey of 9,349 adults, all aged 50, found.

Emma Soames, editor-at-large for Saga Magazine, said: ‘The only way to give your child the wedding of their dreams is for both sets of parents to contribute.

'I have discovered this as my own daughter is getting married this summer and it seems to be the norm these days for the parents in law to contribute.

‘Costs can be enormous especially since a girl’s implacable desire to dance in her wedding dress means that there is normally a celebratory meal for quite large numbers of people before they hit the dance floor.’
