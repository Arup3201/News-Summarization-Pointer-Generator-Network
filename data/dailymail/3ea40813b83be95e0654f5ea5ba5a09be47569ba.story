Thirty years after he became the face of the worst industrial disaster in the world, former Union Carbide chief executive officer (CEO) Warren Anderson has breathed his last at the age of 92. 

Strangely, a month passed by before the world even got a whiff about the death of a man India had sought for prosecution since that fated December of 1984. 

Anderson, who died at a nursing home in the US state of Florida on September 29, was the chairman of Union Carbide when a gas leak at its Bhopal-based subsidiary killed thousands on the night of December 2 and mortally wounded hundreds of others.

Thousands more continue to suffer from ailments caused by the toxic methyl isocyanate, used in the production of a pesticide at Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL), with the harmful effects passed on to the following generation. 

The news of Anderson’s death has come as a blow to the victims and survivors of the tragedy, who had been demanding his extradition from the US and prosecution for UCIL’s fatal negligence. 

What makes it worse for them is the fact that Anderson was allowed to get away (see accompanying story) after a perfunctory arrest in Bhopal four days after the tragedy.

No responsibility 

Shamshad Bi (55), who lost her five-year-old son Rajain that night and her husband to the gas’s lingering effects a few years later, says she wanted to kill Anderson. 

“But now I can’t. However, when I die, I will search for him up there and throttle him, to make him experience what my son and the thousands of other victims did,” she added. 

Tulsi Yadav was just 12 years old at the time of the disaster. At 42, her life continues to be defined by that night, restricted to her house in the Gas Rahat Widhwa Colony owing to her deteriorating health. 

“The gas leak killed my father, damaged my immune system and left me disabled for life,” she said. 

Tulsi takes the news of Anderson’s death with a sense of resignation. 

“He may have escaped prison and the victims, but he was unable to escape death,” she added. 

Living a nightmare 

Aneesa Bi is seething with bitter resentment, directed more at the Indian government than Anderson. 

“The government kept ignoring the Anderson extradition case. His case must have been expedited,” she said. 

“The blame lies with the successive governments. They didn’t care, because when people like us were exposed to the gas, they were safely ensconced in their bungalows and offices,” she added. 

As soon as the American daily New York Times broke the news of Anderson’s death and news television channels caught on, survivors of the tragedy and representatives of organisations working for them assembled outside the derelict premises where the factory was based. 

A common refrain among the demonstrators was the government’s failure to bring Anderson to India and punish him. The prospect of that succour is lost forever now. 

“India’s extradition request for Warren Anderson remained under examination and the US Department of Justice did not take a decision either way,” Abdul Jabbar, convener of the Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangathan (GPMUS) said, citing a Central Bureau of Investigation report from April 2013. 

The CBI, probing the incident, had submitted the report in a Bhopal court. In the report, the CBI stated that the Ministry of External Affairs had presented a status report on Anderson's extradition which clearly stated that, as on January 2012, no action had been taken and the matter was still under examination, Jabbar added. 

‘Negligence’ 

The fact came to light after the GPMUS and Bhopal Gas Peedit Sangharsh Sahyog Samiti moved an application in December 2012 requesting the Bhopal chief judicial magistrate to direct the CBI to present a status report on Anderson’s extradition, explaining the delay. 

India had considered Anderson a fugitive because despite the fact that his bail in those initial days was conditioned on his return, he never did, ignoring the multiple summons issued to him over the years. 

The Madhya Pradesh government confirmed 3,787 deaths as a result of the tragedy, but unofficial estimates placed the toll at 15,000. More than a half-million people were injured, with many dying from illnesses including lung cancer, kidney failure and liver disease. 

Eight Indian officials, including former UCIL chairman Keshub Mahindra, were convicted on negligence charges in 2010 and sentenced to two years in prison. The nightmare, meanwhile, continues for the victims of that “negligence”. 

How Anderson eluded us 

The leak from Union Carbide's Bhopal-based pesticide factory killed thousands immediately

Four days after a deadly gas leak at Union Carbide’s plant in Bhopal killed thousands in 1984, the company’s chairman, Warren Anderson, was arrested on his arrival in the capital of Madhya Pradesh. But after being held under house arrest for only a few hours, Anderson posted bail and quickly left the country, never returning to face trial. 

Several reports have suggested that the government of PM Rajiv Gandhi was pressured by the US to let Anderson go. 

Senior Congress leader Arjun Singh, who was then the chief minister of MP, wrote in his autobiography A Grain of Sand in the Hourglass of Time that home secretary R.D. Pradhan called him “on the instructions of the then Union home minister P.V. Narasimha Rao”. 

Pradhan denied the allegation, saying he was chief secretary of Maharashtra at the time and became Union home secretary only in January 1985. Singh died in 2011 after a prolonged illness. 

Moti Singh, who was the Bhopal collector at the time of the disaster, said Anderson managed to get away by using a phone in the room where he was detained to contact persons in the US. 

“Had we removed the landline phone from his room, Anderson would not have escaped. He possibly made calls to contacts in the US to help him leave India,” Singh added. 

The US embassy reportedly mounted pressure on the Indian government, which released Anderson on a personal bond of Rs 25,000. Anderson never returned to face trial and was declared a fugitive by the Indian courts. 

Rights activists have blamed successive governments for failing to secure the extradition of the man who was held responsible for the death of around 15,000 people. 

Over half a million people were injured by the gas, and many of them died slowly from illnesses like lung cancer, kidney failure and liver disease. 

Anderson was arrested after the CBI took over the investigation on December 6, 1984. While he was being held at the Union Carbide guest house, he spoke to Indian officials and legal advisers of the company. 

The six-foot-two-inch tall executive, then aged 63, wanted to visit the factory but was discouraged by the local administration. 

Swaraj Puri, Bhopal’s Superintendent of Police in 1984, claimed Anderson was arrested on a written order and released on an oral order. 

“We arrested him on the basis of a written order but released him on an oral order,” Puri told the Union Carbide Toxic Gas Leakage Enquiry Commission. He added that the oral order came “from higher-ups”.
