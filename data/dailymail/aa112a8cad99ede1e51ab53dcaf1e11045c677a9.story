Customs officials say 20 small black raw chickens were seized from a passenger arriving from Vietnam at Dulles International Airport outside Washington.

Officials say importing raw poultry from areas where avian influenza or other fowl diseases are known to occur is not allowed without a permit.

Customs say the chickens seized last week have since been incinerated.

Carry-on bag: U.S. Customs seized 20 raw Chinese Silkie chickens from a passenger¿s luggage at Dulles International Airport.

Spokesman Steve Sapp says agents found two cooler bags containing the chickens in a cooler.

The birds were whole, but without feathers and had dark bluish-grey and black skin.

There are very strict restrictions on the animal products that travelers may bring into the U.S.

The importation of fresh, dried or canned meats or meat products is generally not allowed.

Officials say the chickens were fully intact, but de-feathered, with dark-bluish-grey to blackened skin and feet.

Washington Dulles: The Vietnamese passenger was let off without so much as a fine because airport officials couldn't find a translator

The passenger from Vietnam didn’t speak English. And U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at Dulles International Airport say they could not immediately find a translator.

They let the contents of the traveler’s luggage speak for itself and ran it through an X-ray machine.

They took the Chinese Silkies, which are black chickens, and incinerated them.

The meat was the color of a bruise, a dark, blueish-gray. The Washington Post reported the very sight of it had some people reflexively clutching their abdomens.

The chickens are usually white and fluffy, known for being great pets and good to eat.

They are imported legally and sold in Asian markets, said Department of Homeland Security spokesman Steve Sapp however, a permit is required to bring them into the U.S from the USDA.

Fears were also raised of avian flu, which has recently sickened people in China, and claimed the lives of more than 20.

Officials said in a press release on Thursday that 'raw poultry from regions where highly pathogenic avian influenza, Exotic Newcastle disease or other fowl diseases have been known to occur are prohibited from importing to the United States without a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) permit.'

Customs officials say agents also seized items made from prohibited African elephant tusk ivory last week at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport.

Officials say the items were found in the luggage of a 57-year-old Nigerian man.
