Azelle Rodney, 24, died in 2005 after being shot by a former police officer, known only as E7, as police sought to move in on him over a double stabbing

Firearms officers are threatening industrial action after a former policeman was charged with murdering a drug dealer during a Scotland Yard operation.

Armed officers are said to be considering a staged walk-out after it was confirmed that the ex-officer will stand trial over the 2005 death of Azelle Rodney, who died in a hail of bullets when his car was stopped by police marksmen.

Rodney, 24, was hit six times, once each in the arm and back, and fatally four times in the head in Edgware, north London.

The man accused of murdering him, only the third policeman to be charged with committing murder in the course of his duties, can only be identified as E7 after being granted anonymity during a public inquiry.

The secrecy order, made in accordance with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act which grants people the right to a family life, could be lifted when the ex-officer makes his first appearance in court in September.

The decision to charge E7 was welcomed by Rodney’s mother, who has campaigned for justice for nearly a decade and may be in line for a huge compensation payout from the Met.

But it has left Scotland Yard chiefs worried about possible ‘industrial action’ by some police firearms officers who might lay down their weapons in support of their former colleague.

Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for armed policing, said the move to charge E7 had left officers shocked.

He told The Times: ‘Firearms officers volunteer for the role and many are now considering their future career choices.

‘Officers are not above the law and they are accountable for their individual decisions, but carrying a gun on behalf of the state is a big ask and it just got bigger.’

The decision to charge E7 comes after a three-month public inquiry into Rodney’s death, led by former judge Sir Christopher Holland.

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: ‘We have carefully considered the new file of evidence submitted to us and have decided that a former Metropolitan Police officer, currently identified only as E7, will be prosecuted for murder. The individual currently has anonymity.’

The murder suspect will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on September 10.

Rodney’s mother Susan Alexander said: ‘I am very pleased at the decision to prosecute the officer who killed my son. I have waited a long time to see this day and hope this prosecution will lead to justice for Azelle.’ 

Rodney was hit by eight shots in less than two seconds from a high-powered carbine at almost point blank range.

The rounds were fired from the open window of a patrol car within a split second of pulling alongside the VW Golf carrying Rodney.

The murder charge against E7 is 
believed to be only the third time in recent years that an officer has 
been charged with murder while on active duty.

PC
 Chris Sherwood from Sussex Police was acquitted of murder in 2001, 
after he shot James Ashley, 39, while he was naked and unarmed.

The shooting had taken place while police searched his flat in Hastings, East Sussex.

The officer said he believed Mr Ashley was mistakenly pointing a gun at him and was about to shoot.

The
 Chief Constable of Sussex, Martin Richards, who was the nominal 
defendant in the civil case that followed, admitted negligence and 
agreed to pay the family damages.

But the force always strongly denied misconduct.

In
 an earlier case - and believed to be the first of its kind - 
Metropolitan Police PC Patrick Hodgson was cleared at the Old Bailey of 
the murder and manslaughter of suspected car thief David Ewin, 38.

He stood trial three times after the jury failed to deliver a verdict on the first two occasions.

He had always denied both the murder and manslaughter of Mr Ewin in Barnes, south west London, in February 2005.

The
 officer, then 49, was part of the crew of an armed response vehicle 
that had spotted the stolen Toyota sports car parked outside a shop. 

Mr Ewin died from his injuries after the shooting.

Officer E7 claimed he feared Rodney was about to fire a submachine gun.

Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham, the other occupants of the VW Golf, were jailed for seven and six years respectively in January 2006 after pleading guilty to possession of firearms.

Lovell was also convicted of allowing drug production in his Hammersmith home.

In court he claimed that he had let Rodney use his flat as a crack factory to cancel out a drugs debt.

At the time of his death Rodney was wanted over a double stabbing in Ealing.

There have only been two previous cases where police officers were charged with murder. In 1997 Metropolitan Police PC Patrick Hodgson was cleared of the 1995 murder of suspected car thief David Ewin in Barnes, south-west London.

The second related to PC Chris Sherwood, who was accused of murder after he shot suspected drug dealer James Ashley while he was naked and unarmed when officers searched his flat in St Leonards, East Sussex, in 1998. He was cleared in 2001.

Leaders of the Police Federation, which represents more than 125,000 rank and file officers, held discussions about firearms officers conducting ‘unofficial strikes’ when marksmen faced the prospect of being charged with murder in two other cases.

The shootings of unarmed decorator Harry Stanley in 1999 and Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005 were mired in controversy but possible walkouts were averted when prosecutors ruled out murder charges.

E7 has been supported in his legal battle by the Metropolitan branch of the Police Federation, whose chairman John Tully said: ‘Parallels may be drawn with the Harry Stanley case going back a number of years when two officers were arrested.

‘At the time there were concerns about the lack of support from senior management and Government. It’s a very difficult job.’

But he added: ‘I have not detected any similar feelings in the workforce currently. It could have an impact on morale.’

The Police Firearms Officers Association said the case had raised many issues.

A spokesman said: ‘The decision by the CPS to prosecute E7 raises many issues around the role of armed policing and officers having confidence in the law should they be involved in a shooting.’
