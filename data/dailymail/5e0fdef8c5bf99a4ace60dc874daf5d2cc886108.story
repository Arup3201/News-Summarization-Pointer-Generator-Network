Al Qaeda has expanded into the Indian subcontinent, the leader of the terror group said in a video statement released Thursday, with a regional group that he vowed would bring Islamic law to the region and 'wage jihad against its enemies.'

At least three Indian states with large Muslim populations had been put on alert in the wake of the video's release, local TV stations reported.

In the video, which was seen online by the Site monitoring group, Ayman al-Zawahiri said Al Qaeda had been preparing for years to set up in the region.

The new group 'is the fruit of a blessed effort of more than two years to gather the mujahedeen in the Indian subcontinent into a single entity,' al-Zawahiri said.

 While the statement referred to the 'Indian subcontinent' - a term that most commonly refers to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal - al-Zawahiri's comments were widely seen as directed at India, a largely Hindu nation with a large Muslim minority.

Al-Zawahiri said the group, Qaedat al-Jihad in the Indian subcontinent, would fight for an Islamic state and laws across the region, 'which was part of the Muslims' territories before it was occupied by the infidel enemy'.

Until recently, India had largely seen itself as beyond the recruiting territory of international jihadists like Al Qaeda. 

Over the past few months, however, the Islamic State militant group, which has seized control of large parts of Iraq and Syria, has grown in prominence in India, and is increasingly believed to be gaining followers here.

Al Qaeda leader Ayman al ZawahIri  announced the formation of an Indian branch of his militant group he said would spread Islamic rule and 'raise the flag of jihad' across the subcontinent.

He said: 'My Muslim brothers everywhere, peace be with you today, I announce to all Muslims in the world and especially in the Indian subcontinent, the founding of a new branch of Qaedat al-Jihad. 

'This is to help raise the flag of jihad and the return of the Islamic rule in the subcontinent, which one day used to be part of the land of the Muslims until the infidel enemy took it over and divided it.' 

He also renewed a longstanding vow of loyalty to Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar, in an apparent snub to the Islamic State armed group challenging al Qaeda for leadership of transnational Islamist militancy.

Zawahri described the formation of 'Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent' as glad tidings for Muslims 'in Burma, Bangladesh, Assam, Gujarat, Ahmedabad, and Kashmir' and said the new wing would rescue Muslims there from injustice and oppression. 

Last month, an Indian engineering student who had traveled to Iraq with friends, and who was thought to have joined the Islamic State, was reported killed.

Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh met Thursday morning with top security and intelligence officials to discuss the threat.

A spokesman for India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party said the statement was 'a matter of serious concern. But there is nothing to worry about. We have a strong government at the federal level.'

India, though, has a notoriously underfunded and ill-trained security infrastructure. In 2008, a small group of Pakistani militants attacked Mumbai, India's financial hub, effectively shutting down the city for days and leaving 166 people killed.

New Delhi has also waged a long-running insurgency war in Kashmir, India's only majority-Muslim state, with militants fighting to bring independence to the Himalayan region or join it to neighboring Pakistan. The fighting has left thousands of people dead.

Some analysts saw the announcement, which showed al-Zawahiri speaking in front of a dark curtain, as an effort to revive the fortunes of Al Qaeda, which has been largely eclipsed, at least publicly, by the Islamic State, the militant group that in Syria and Iraq that recently executed two American journalists.

'This may be ruse for al-Zawahiri  to enhance his diminishing clout among Arab Muslims and Pakistani mujahedeen who are veering in a big way toward the Islamic State militant group  leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,' said Rana Banerji, a prominent Indian intelligence and security analyst.

Omar Hamid, Head of Asia Analysis at IHS Country Risk, meanwhile, said that Al Qaeda's establishment of a local branch in India seems geared to take advantage of the trend of fighters returning from Afghanistan 

He said: 'Al Qaeda leader Ayman Al Zawahiri's announcement of the creation of a branch of al Qaeda in the Indian subcontinent, to be known as Qaedat-al-Jihad, is a likely response to recent global and regional developments.

'For some time now, al Qaeda has seen its authority eroded by the fact that it is no longer able to independently carry out large scale attacks anywhere in the world, and by the emergence of rival factions. 

'In light of the ISAF withdrawal from Afghanistan in December 2014, some battle hardened fighters freed up from Afghanistan will almost certainly transition into India, thus increasing the capacity of local groups. Al Qaeda's establishment of a local branch seems geared to take advantage of this trend.'
