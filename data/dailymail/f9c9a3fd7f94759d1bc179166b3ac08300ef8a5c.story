My close friend's summer wedding was in Bibury, the prettiest village in the UK, according to the most influential designer of the 19th century William Morris. And he should know.

Not only was I to be an usher but I was also fortunate enough to be staying in the UK's first and only residential nature reserve, better known as Lower Mill Estate.

While my friends lugged their wedding outfits and bags into their hastily-arranged B&Bs, I was picking up the keys to Aspen Lodge - a timber-clad four-bed, four-bathroom detached retreat set within the 550-acres of this gated, luxury second home development in the Cotswolds.

Established in the early 1990s by the late Jeremy Paxton, the one-time champion waterskier, pilot and entrepreneur, with the aim of providing sustainable living alongside wildlife, it now attracts wealthy professionals and celebrities looking to get away from the hustle and bustle.

Paxton sadly passed away last year aged just 53 and left his family to continue his legacy - a challenge they have clearly accepted with pride and gusto.

As my friends unpacked and looked around their respective hotels, I took one of the estate's brand new mountain bikes out for a ride across the reserve and over to the on-site shop to stock up of eggs, bacon, wine and bread.

The spa's outdoor pool, even in September, was heaven - heated and surrounded by comfortable sun loungers

Lower Mill Estate sits at the heart of the Cotswolds - one of England’s most diverse, attractive and appealing areas.

It has a rich heritage of country houses, wildlife parks, nature reserves and gardens and it’s dotted with idyllic villages and historic towns such as Bourton-on-the-Water, Stow-on-the-Wold, Tetbury and Cirencester.

The regency pleasures of Cheltenham and the Georgian glories of Bath are less than twenty miles south west of the estate.

From the shop I cycled over to the spa that comes complete with indoor and outdoor heated pools, a technogym, sauna, steam rooms, and Europe's first lily-filtered outdoor eco-pool.

There's also a lounge in which to relax and treatment rooms with over 60  therapies from which to choose.

Beyond the spa are eight lakes and two rivers that provide the perfect opportunity for boating and fishing.

For those looking to get close to nature, the woodlands and hedgerows are home to numerous species of plants, including several varieties of orchid, with three bird hides providing the ideal spot for quiet contemplation of the native wildlife.

 Mill Estate offers three nights in a two-bedroom luxury apartment (sleeping 
up to 4), from £453 on a self-catering basis and including spa access

It is approximately one hour 45 minutes from London. It sits surrounded by acres of lakes, woods and meadows

There is a well-equipped on site shop. Guests can rent bikes, canoes and paddle boards

I couldn't believe that only two hours before I was loading my car in West London.

I knew it was only a matter of time before my friends showed up wanting to look around and I was only too ready to show it off. 

By the time they arrived I was perched out on the back terrace, having lit the BBQ and opened the giant glass doors to both front and back balconies.

The one thing that struck all of them while navigating their way around the lakes to Aspen Lodge was just how unique each and every house is on the estate. All are individually designed with prices for three nights in a two-bedroom luxury apartment (sleeping up to 4) starting from £453, on a self-catering basis, including spa access. 

On the day of the wedding we woke to blue sky, balcony doors wide open and a beautiful breeze ripping off the back lake.

The boys loaded a car with the usher suits and headed over to the groom’s hotel room above the village pub in nearby Barnsley, just outside Cirencester.

One ushers lunch later and we were off to Cripps Barn for the wedding and party. As the bride and groom, Hannah and Dan, made their vows, and we stood watching, a butterfly fluttered in and out of the pews and remained for most of the service. A poignant moment that seemed to capture the specialness of the day.

Dinner and the speeches passed, as they too often do, like a blur as conversation whirred and drinks flowed before I headed back in a taxi to Lower Mill.

The beautiful people! I forgot how much fun it is to be in a swimming pool with good friends

The bride and groom joined us all the following day for the perfect post-wedding catch-up. We rode the bikes to the spa and spent the late afternoon swimming in the outdoor heated pool before heading back for a barbecue on the front terrace.

We ate outside as the sun went down and toasted the amazing weekend and the beautiful surroundings that made it the perfect wedding.

What you want from a mini-break is a sense of discontinuity - to leave and feel you've ticked the boxes and made the most of your few days. You get that at Lower Mill. The luxury of the homes and the resort itself make it hard to leave, even for the beauty of the Cotswolds. But that's no bad thing. 

Three nights at Aspen Lodge on Lower Mill Estate cost from £1050.
