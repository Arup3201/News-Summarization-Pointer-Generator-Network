Liverpool will make a last-ditch attempt to persuade Ashley Cole to join them.

But Cole, who was left out of England’s World Cup squad, is poised to leave the Premier League and move to Serie A.

Roma hope to rubber stamp a deal with the ex-England left-back next week.

There could be a new wave of Costa Rican players on their way to the Premier League after their great showing at the World Cup and the involvement of English agency Sillsport.

Arsenal are taking Joel Campbell back from his loan spell in Greece, although the Gunners could farm him out again and other Costa Ricans have attracted the eye of English scouts.

Three years ago Sillsport set up a fund to invest in several South and Central American clubs to help develop young players in return for an eventual return on their transfer fees.

Out to impress: Joel Campbell trains on Friday ahead of Costa Rica's semi-final against Holland

The company has developed a strong relationship with former West Ham striker Paolo Wanchope who is the Costa Rica assistant coach and the company has a major tie-up with several clubs in Costa Rica.

A number of players are now looking to capitalise on Costa Rica’s success at the World Cup this summer by securing moved to club’s in England or Spain.

 

Arsenal are poised to sign Mathieu Debuchy from Newcastle this this week.

The Gunners believe they have an £8m deal in the bag for the France right-back who will take over from Bacary Sagna after his move to Manchester City.

Indeed Debuchy claimed in TV interview after France’s defeat to Germany that he ‘will be playing for Arsenal next season.’

While Frank Lampard has snubbed his uncle and QPR manager Harry to instead turn out for Melbourne City ahead his move to MLS club New York City, Rio Ferdinand is poised to agree a move to Loftus Road.

Ferdinand has been playing a return to the London area for some time when he knew he wouldn’t get a new deal at Manchester United.

A luxury mansion on the Farnborough Park estate on the south east London/Kent border near the M25 is close to being fully renovated.

I am also hearing

Ashley Young is one of several players on the way out of Manchester United and could move back to Aston Villa.

Swansea and Newcastle are two other possible destinations.

Southampton want £25m to sell Dejan Lovren to Liverpool.

The Saints have already rejected a £20m offer from the Reds.

But they want more although it is possible they will consider one of the several squad players Liverpool have on offer as part of an exchange deal.

Why didn’t someone come up with ‘shaving foam’ idea at free kicks  years ago?

It’s so simple and so effective. It is hoped it will be adopted in the Premier League this season.

Marouane Fellaini will be shown the door by Manchester United as soon as new boss Louis Van Gaal gets his feet under the table.

Everton, who sold Fellaini to United for £27m last summer, will be interested in taking the Belgium midfielder back; but only in a cut price deal at around £12m.

The player would also have to agree to a compromise over his basic salary.Newcastle would also be interested.

Boost: Belgium's Marouane Fellaini has enjoyed something of a renaissance at World Cup

Newcastle are also set to make a move for Manchester City’s Micah Richards.

Richards played just two Premier League matches for City last season and has been told he can leave after the arrival of Bacary Sagna from Arsenal.

The 26-year-old has one year of his contract remaining and could be bought for as little as £5 million.

Young USA right-back DeAndre Yedlin, who came on as an early substitute in their defeat to Belgium, has attracted the attention of several Premier League clubs after his superb performance.

And the 20-year-old, who is currently at Seattle Sounders, could secure a move to Liverpool if he impresses during a pre-season trial.

Wanted: USA right-back DeAndre Yedlin has attracted the attention of Premier League clubs

 

Mon: Astonishingly, Luis Suraez comes out and protests his innocence. The utter absence of remorse should have persuaded FIFA to double his suspension.

Tues: At last Suarez makes a form of apology but it’s just a cynical way of keeping his move to Barcelona alive.

Who would have thought it? Belgium’s 2-1 win over the USA turns out to be one of the all-time World Cup classics.

Weds: Barcelona officials fly into London and start formal talks with Liverpool about buying Suarez who was off to Spain before his biting incident anyway. But Liverpool have had to take a cut on the £100m they wanted with the cash sum dropping close to £60 million.

Thurs: Former England Under 21 boss Stuart Pearce slams Roy Hodgson for not blooding players properly via the Under 21 set-up; he's right.

Fri: It wasn’t pretty as Brazil bruised their way in to the semi-final by beating Columbia 2-1. But with Neymar now out Germany have the ability and the mental toughness to beat the hosts in the last four.

Libero

Glenn Hoddle has said he no longer wants to see Brazil win the World Cup because they are not playing Jogo Bonito.

He has a point.

With Neymar now out they lack Samba stars in the grand tradition.

Ironically Germany, who they now face in the semi-finals, used to pride themselves on grinding out results like Brazil have but now play the more expansive football.

In that respect, if this tournament is to be remembered as one of the best ever then I suspect Hoddle would like to see Germany beat Brazil then lift the trophy for the first time since 1990.

That was one of the dullest-ever tournaments, England’s great exploits apart of course.

In many ways I agree.

It might seem romantic for Brazil to win a sixth World Cup in Rio next week but not if the imprint they leave is bruises not Samba soccer.

Mind you, the free kick David Luiz scored against Colombia was in the grand tradition of Pele, Rivelino, Zico and Co.

But the world really would seem upside down if a Brazilian centre half turns out to be their World Cup hero.

Stunning: Brazil defender David Luiz strikes an unstoppable free-kick into the top corner of the net

Set piece: Thiago Silva and Colombia keeper David Opsina look on as Brazil take the lead on Friday

Substance over style for a sixth star: Some believe Brazil are abandoning the style that made them great... particularly in the World Cup in 1970, which they won with a 4-1 victory over Italy

 

BTW

David Dein hit the nail on the head the other day when he said one of the problems of developing young talent in England  is because there is less and less sport in school, especially outside school hours.

There are several reasons for that.

One of them is the academy system at big clubs . One of the many down sides of the academies is that they draw talent away from school, district and county teams which used to be a route to the top for many players.

 

Big Phil Scolari has told all the critics he has faced that they ‘can go to hell’.

Foot on the ball, Phil. The Brazilian public will not take kindly to their romantic vision of football being revised and if he continues to go completely against the Samba spirit he could be the first manager to win a World Cup and be sacked within days.

Back Heel

Since 1930 there have been 56 scorers in World Cup finals.

Thirty five of them are still alive.

Celebrated photographer Michael Donald managed to track them down over the last few years and has compiled an amazing collection of portraits of Pele, Martin Peters and so on but of course not Diego Maradona or Johann Cruyff.

They are currently being exhibited at the trendy bar/gallery The Proud Archivist which is in Haggerston, London just up to road from Hoxton.

Back of the net: Since 1930 there have been 56 scorers in World Cup finals, including Pele in 1970

If you are in the area it’s a must visit. There is also a great Panini exhibition there too.

The unique collection will be up for auction soon and it is believed the collection could fetch over £100,000.

That sounds a lot but not when you think Tracey Emin’s bedroom installation art ‘classic’ is supposedly worth over £2m.
