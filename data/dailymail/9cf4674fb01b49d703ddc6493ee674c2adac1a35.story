Famous faces from the world of TV, film, politics and literature have turned their casual scribbles into a good cause.

This year celebrity doodlers from Bill Nighy and Julian Fellowes to Lorraine Kelly and Penny Lancaster and their sketches will feature alongside dozens more in a ten day eBay auction starting on National Doodle Day, Friday, 6 February, in aid of Epilepsy Action.

But can you match the celebs to their scribbles? Scroll down to see how well you do.

The stars of the line-up this year include Grayson Perry who has drawn one of his trademark art works for the auction and Sarah, Duchess of York, who shares a positive message on her picture.

They hope their pictures will sell for thousands, raising cash for the charity. 

But for those who fancy giving celebrities a run for their money can now create, upload and share doodles on the official website while competing for prizes.

Speaking about this year's campaign, a spokesperson for the charity said: 'Every year we’re overwhelmed by support from celebrities and always look forward to seeing the variety and creativity of the doodles they send in.

'National Doodle Day is always a terrific success, raising thousands of pounds for Epilepsy Action. 

'The highest-grossing doodle ever sold for over £1,600, but each one makes a huge difference to people with epilepsy and their families.'

5. The Scottish breakfast television presenter is known for her sunny personality and twinkly manner

6. The English actor, novelist, film director and screenwriter best known for creating our favourite aristocratic soap opera created this colourful doodle. But what would Lady Mary say?

7. This legendary interviewer and jazz fan who discovered Jamie Cullum, 79, has created a poodle doodle 

Sarah, Duchess of York is the patron of a variety of charities and works with daughters Eugenie and Beatrice to help improve conditions of women working in sweatshops who provide clothes to high street retailers

Epilepsy affects around one in every 100 people in the UK alone and 87 people are diagnosed with the condition every day.

So what do the stars' doodles say about them? More than meets the eye, if handwriting analyst Ruth Rostron's theory is anything to go by.

In fact, she believes that what you choose to doodle actually reveals volumes about your personality and mood.

Ruth said: 'Symbols that recur in doodles relate to basic human needs for love, security and survival.

'Interpretation of a particular doodle will depend on the way it has been drawn and the context but there are some common shapes that people doodle which have a real meaning.'

English broadcaster, journalist and author, Sir Michael Parkinson, left, and skier Chemmy Alcott also got involved in the charitable cause 

Joanna Lumley put her colouful doodle to good use, helping to raise money for Epilepsy Action

Expert doodler and comic story writer Liz Pichon, who penned the book, Tom Gates: Extra Special Treats ... Not,  lifted the lid on what our doodles really mean, and you'll be surprised by what your mindless scribbles reveal.

For instance, one leggy celebrity, known for marrying a famous British rocker, included a boat in her doodle

The type of boat someone doodles and its relative size and stability determines its interpretation - the water around the boat indicates whether emotions are tranquil or turbulent, says Liz.

If the boat is  on a calm sea, it indicates the individual is self-assured, enjoys luxury and is dreaming of a holiday.

10. This much-loved actor, famous for his lithe figure, dry humour, floppy blonde hair and glasses captioned his picture 'May the god of cheerfulness have children in your mind'

11. She's the leggy wife of one of Britain's favourite Seventies rockers and mother to their two children. She added the phrase:  'May all the starts shine bright to bring you happiness in the New Year!' to her doodle

Joanna Lumley's scribble is filled with love hearts. A symbol of love and romance, heart doodles suggest an affectionate, sentimental, emotional and romantic person, or someone dreaming of love, marriage and/or sex, says Liz.

Martin Clunes has drawn an elephant because, he claims, it's the only thing he can draw.

According to Liz's theory, different animals have typical characteristics and also express moods. 

Domestic animals are doodled by those who are home-loving, like their creature comforts and tend to be affectionate.

If they’re curled up it could suggest they are feeling defensive.

Actor Bill Nighy and artist Grayson Perry added their own scribbles to the charity auction

12. This clown was drawn by a northern comedian who was big in the Seventies and Eighties, now his daughter has her own Saturday night Radio 2 show

Jungle animals reflect an aggressive, macho or frustrated nature, while caged animals could indicate a person is feeling trapped. 

One of our foremost winter athletes has sketched lots of stars. Stars, says Liz, suggest aspiration and ambition and are doodled by those determined to succeed.

They also indicate an intellectual or spiritual nature, or someone who is optimistic, a bit of a dreamer or romanticises.

This analysis, then, befits the an alpine ski racer who competes on the World Cup circuit in all five disciplines and starred on the ITV reality show Dancing on Ice in 2012.
