Shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn is set to escape gang rape charges after a vice girl told police they were playing 'sex games'.

The alleged victim had now changed her story to tell police that the group sex with prostitutes at an orgy in Washington DC was 'consensual', it has been revealed.

Strauss-Kahn, 54, had faced 20 years in prison over the claims by the prostitute named Marion that he used force against her and other girls during the sex session in December 2010.

Disgraced: Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn is set to escape gang rape charges after the alleged victim changed her story

The £800-a-night hooker had told police in initial interviews last year: 'He gripped my hands, he pulled my hair, he hurt me.'

She insisted he had tried to subject her to degrading acts, adding: 'I refused, telling him no. I said firmly and loudly several times that I did not want that.'

But a judicial source has now told French daily Le Figaro that the woman had now retracted her statement.

The paper said: 'She has retracted her deposition in a letter sent to judicial police.

'She said that in fact the sex was consensual and that the group was playing sexual games.

'The investigators, who believe they have gone as far as they can with their inquiries, have sent the file back to the prosecutors and a shelving of the inquiry will follow.'

But even if gang rape charges are dropped, the man once tipped as a future president of France still stands accused of conspiring with pimps to procure girls for sex parties around the world.

He and four other men are also accused of knowing fraudulently obtained money was being paid to the vice girls by a prostitution racket based in Lille, northern France.

Among those under investigation are former Lille police chief Jean-Christophe Lagarde and Lille businessmen David Roquet and Fabrice Paszkowski.

Strauss-Kahn has been embroiled in a catalogue of sex scandals since he was arrested for trying to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May last year.

After being held in New York's notorious Ryker's Island prison, criminal charges were dropped and he returned to France only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer.

When those allegations were also dropped, he was then confronted with more claims he used hookers supplied by the Lille vice network.

He has admitted to attending many 'swingers parties' but insisted the young women were not prostitutes and he often had sex with 'willing girls' in their 20s.

His lawyer Richard Malka has described DSK as 'simple swinger' who has committed nothing more than 'crimes of lust'.

Mr Malka said his client would now do everything in his power to have the charges brought by two judges in Lille dismissed.

Strauss-Kahn is now formally under 'judicial control' on £85,000 bail until judges decide whether to send him to stand trial.
