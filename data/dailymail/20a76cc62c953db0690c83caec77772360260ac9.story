It has crafted an image as the most upmarket of the major food stores.

But Waitrose’s customers are not above poking fun at the pretentious antics of fellow shoppers, it seems.

Some of the outlandish remarks said to have been heard in the aisles have become an internet hit.

The Overheard In Waitrose Facebook page has more than 285,000 likes and receives dozens of posts said to be from shoppers and staff.

Overheard In Waitrose is a collection of unintentionally hilarious remarks made by upmarket customers

One butcher who suggested topside was told: 'Topside for my dog? Anyone would think you wanted to kill her!'

Some of the gems are reminiscent of those put on Twitter when Waitrose ran a campaign asking shoppers to tweet why they shopped there, starting with #IshopatWaitrosebecause.

The campaign was adopted by jokers, who posted comments such as '#IshopatWaitrosebecause the Asda value peacock feed isn't as nice.' 

Others are posted by people who say they are staff, or 'partners' at Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis partnership, where employees are known for their courtesy and helpfulness.

The new Facebook page includes some astonishing remarks, uttered by customers apparently unaware of how they sound, sent in every day from visitors to Waitrose branches across Britain.

Alluding to a life of second homes, yachts, sirloin-fed pets and problems with swans in the garden, they create a joyful picture of life for this particularly British breed.

Children in Waitrose clearly have different tastes to those whose parents shop in less exclusive supermarkets

Here are some of the best:

'Lucas, put that falafel down, you already chose olives with manchego as your treat.'

'Thank you, that will be £428.49'

'It's like the Third World in Tesco: no pine nuts.'

Top dog: One Waitrose customer was appalled when the butcher suggested a slightly cheaper cut for her dog

Waitrose's line of foods created by top chef Heston Blumenthal include such essentials as Earl Grey stollen

Nightmare: Waitrose customers can hardly imagine the horror of running out of such culinary essentials

According to the Facebook page, one couple in the Newark branch in Nottinghamshire who spotted another customer with an Asda shopping bag said to each other: 'Should she be walking around in here with that?'

And after a Waitrose butcher told a woman they had run out of fillet steak but she could have topside instead, she replied: 'Topside?  Why on earth would we feed Winnie topside? 

'Anyone would think you wanted to kill the poor dog.'  (To this, one Facebook user replied: 'You have to work at Waitrose, as I did for 27 years, to know that comments like this are not fictitious.')

A customer in the Wilmslow, Cheshire, branch was overheard telling her husband: 'Please don't rummage in the reduced bin, darling, someone from the golf club might see you.'

One child following its mother down an aisle asked: 'Mummy, are we doing shopping for the boat as well?'

And another mother was overheard saying: 'Lucas put that falafel down, you already chose olives with Manchego for your treat'

The shame: Customers in the smart supermarket know they might see friends there, and behave accordingly

Upmarket groceries for an upmarket clientele: Waitrose sells products you are unlikely to find anywhere else

Other comments include: 'The pheasants on our land get so cocky outside the shooting season, I can't wait for October to come round again.'

'Hurry up with the focaccia darling, that man's coming to clean the pool soon', and 'Darling, do we need parmesan for both houses?'

One mother ticked her son off, saying: 'Orlando that's enough blueberries, I only need them to go on top of the venison.'

While another said: 'Of course she can come and play with us this afternoon, just so long as she is OK with the fact that due to the storm we have no wifi.'

One particular gem sent in recounts the instance when a Waitrose customer approached a member of staff to ask where the 'night milk' was.

When he asked her what she was referring to, the customer replied: 'You know, the night milk - milked at night from the cows because the vitamins are better in it.' 

Waitrose has a royal warrant to supply groceries to the Queen, and is known for its particular clientele

One man in his 40s was overheard telling his friend: 'Gosh, its been two days since I last meditated' and apparently appeared shocked by the realisation as he said it out loud.

To which his friend replied: 'You must be feeling like a muggle.'

One woman in a trouser suit told her friend: 'We've got such a swan problem in the garden this year', while another shopper was heard saying: 'Of course I would buy the smoked salmon, but it makes the Maserati smell like a fishmonger's.'

Another comment was: 'Gosh you have to be millionaires to shop here - just as well we are', while one mother said: 'Luciano behave! Children these days... I blame the au pairs.'

Meanwhile one poor Waitrose husband was lambasted by his wife: 'Darling...kamalata olives not halkidiki. Seriously darling we're having Châteauneuf du Pape, not Lambrusco.'

This morning a spokesman for Waitrose was characterstically understated when asked for a comment on the Facebook page, saying simply: 'It's nice to see people having a bit of fun.'
