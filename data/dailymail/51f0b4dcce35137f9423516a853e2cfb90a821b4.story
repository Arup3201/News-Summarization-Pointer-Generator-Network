In the last few years, the beard has had a renaissance.

No longer just the preserve of tramps and lumberjacks, it is now seen on lawyers, bar staff and artists across the western world who have wanted to add a bit of edge to their look.

The move has not gone unnoticed by the fairer sex, many of whom are delighted at the new facial hair trend. 

So it can only be good news that a new dating website has emerged, specifically linking up beard lovers with men who have beards.

New dating website Bristlr matches beard lovers to men with beards. The site launched six weeks ago and it already has tens of thousands of users

John Kershaw from Manchester launched Bristlr six weeks ago and already tens of thousands of people have signed up. 

He started the project as a bit of a joke after suggesting the idea on Facebook and seeing a positive response from his friends. 

The (bearded) 28-year-old software developer said: 'When I posted the question on my Facebook page, my friends said they thought it was a really good idea. 

'So  I made this fake landing site where people could sign up to this app that didn't really exist, just because I was curious to see how far people would go with it.'

In the last week alone, more than 10,000 new people signed up to the site

He continued: 'I wanted to see who was willing to go through the hassle of signing up, giving their email address, etc. 

'After 100 people signed up in four days, I thought there must be some scope, so I made a proper website and launched  it four weeks ago. 

'It has kind of got a little bit out of hand at this moment, so I'm just kind of going with it, which is great fun.'

In the last week alone, more than 10,000 new people signed up to the site and when the IOS and Android apps are launched in a couple of weeks, those numbers are likely to grow even faster. 

John admits he can't believe how successful it has been so far, especially as it started out as a bit of a joke. 

He said: 'We are comfortably in the five figures now. It does surprise me because I'm very cynical and I think it is such a stupid idea that no one is going to want to do it.

'But it turns out that actually, people think it's kind of cool. I've started to talk to the people using it, and some say that it is the best dating site they've ever used. 

'I think it's the fact that instead of it being this serious business like “Hey, if you click this button we're going to do this serious thing,” it's more like “Hey, I like your beard.” 

'It’s light-hearted - you can't take it too seriously, which I think is really appealing to people. I did build a block button just in case though, because inevitably there are going to be creepy dudes. 

'I’m sure there will also be guys who go on there without beards to try and pick up women, but they're not going to have much luck.'

The site uses a minimal amount of information from users, so as not to be too invasive. But it does keep a tally of people with beards and people who love beards - the ratio is almost 50:50.  

John said: 'I've been quite surprised by the ratio of beards to people looking for beards.'

'We don't track whether people are male or female, just whether or not they have a beard or they are looking for someone with a beard - we track the import stuff. 

'It's just under half of people who have beards on Bristlr. 

'I think I was expecting it to be 90 per cent people with beards.'

That isn't the only surprise, John is also amazed by the different countries around the world where the site has already become a hit. 

He said: 'It's only international by chance - because I was too lazy to limit it when I was building the site.'

 The site is already in the UK, Holland, Canada and the US

He continued: ''It's really big in Holland and I had someone from Montreal today tell me it is now getting quite big over there, which is ridiculous. 

'San Francisco was one of the first cities to embrace it. 

'It's catching on slowly in New York, but I feel like they're slightly more cynical about it.'

John admits that it may just be a craze while the beard trend lasts, but he is enjoying it while it does.  

He said: 'I know beards are definitely in, people have realised they are kind of lovely. 

Keep it neat.

Invest in some nice beard oil, get a good pair of trimmers and just experiment.

If you feel good in your beard then that comes across as confidence. 

A good beard doesn’t replace your personality but it does compliment it.

'I get that it is personal preference, just like some people like short hair and some like it long. 

'I know some people who are repulsed by beards and some people just love them.

'You can tell a lot about a man by his beard, not that they just have one, because they may have just forgotten to shave. 

'But just like seeing someone with a really nice suit or haircut, a nice well-kept beard shows some pride in appearance.'
