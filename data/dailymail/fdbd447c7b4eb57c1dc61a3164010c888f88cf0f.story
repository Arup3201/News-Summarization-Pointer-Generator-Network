A 16-year-old girl survived certain death on Saturday night when her glasses miraculously deflected a bullet that was about to hit her in the face.

Alonza Bryant, 16, was asleep on the couch in her parent’s living room when a drive-by shooter opened fire on their Seattle home.

The incident happened at around 9:40 pm on Saturday, when there were several people, including children, inside the residence at 54th Avenue South and South Roxbury Street.  

Lucky to be alive: Alonza Bryant, 16, was taken to the hospital with a relatively minor flesh wound after her glasses miraculously deflected a bullet

An unknown group of individuals, possibly in a dark sedan, drove by the house and began shooting.  Several of the shots went through the walls and one round went through the front window.  

Bryant was struck by a single round in the bridge of her glasses, breaking them.

‘I fell asleep with my glasses on,’ Alonza Bryant told NWCN.com. ‘If I didn’t have my glasses on I wouldn’t be here.’

The other occupants in the house called 911 as the car returned and fired into the house a second time. Amazingly, she was not seriously injured.

Investigators believe the residence was targeted, but that the 16-year-old girl was not the intended victim.

Alonza's mother, LaVette Bryant, said nobody living in the home has a connection to gangs.

‘We are honest, upright citizens. We don't do anything - harm - to anyone in this neighborhood,’ she said.

She told NWCN.com that she doesn’t want her family to spend another night in the bullet-ridden house.

‘We have to move. We have to find a place to stay tonight because we're not staying here,’ she said.
