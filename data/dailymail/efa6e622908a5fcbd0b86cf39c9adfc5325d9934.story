Ed Balls claimed £1,610 for cleaners without providing any receipts

Ed Balls and a string of Labour frontbenchers claimed expenses for cleaning and other odd jobs without submitting receipts, it has emerged.

Mr Balls claimed £1,610 for cleaners and his wife Yvette Cooper claimed £2,640 for housework and gardening, out of a total of £37,881 claimed by 12 Labour MPs.

But the shadow chancellor did not submit a single receipt for the work done – despite telling families they had a duty to record the personal details of gardeners, cleaners and handymen, no matter how small the job done.

It also emerged that Mr Balls and his wife Yvette Cooper have never asked their window cleaner in Castleford, West Yorkshire, for a receipt despite employing him for nearly two decades.

Pontefract Window Cleaning Services last night confirmed it had never been asked for a receipt by Mr Balls. The firm cleans the windows at the three-storey Balls family home once a month, charging £12 each time.

Bur a spokesman for Mr Balls insisted his practice of demanding receipts applied only to jobs where he pays in cash.

He pointed out that Mr Balls pays his window cleaner by cheque and receives handwritten invoices every few months.

He also defended the cleaning claims. He said: 'Ed's cleaner was and continues to be employed on PAYE and paid by bank transfer. These claims were made fully in accordance with the Fees Office rules.'

On Sunday Mr Balls said even someone who 'cuts your hedge for a tenner' should provide an invoice to discourage tax avoidance.

Mr Balls said he had the 'name and address and a receipt' for every cash transaction because it was 'the right thing to do'.

David Cameron this morning said he wanted Mr Balls 'to have more time to clean his own windows and cut his own hedge' – by defeating Labour at the next election.

Yesterday he insisted that it was fine to pay for goods and services without asking for a receipt – because the onus was on the tradesman to pay his or her taxes.

Mr Cameron said he had occasionally paid things in cash without getting a receipt, but insisted that he has never helped someone 'evade the taxes that they should pay'.

A Downing Street spokesman said: 'The onus is on the trader who is responsible for paying the taxes that they owe.'

Mr Cameron's intervention came after Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said getting a receipt for all cash-in-hand jobs was a 'matter of good housekeeping' and was a 'good thing to do'.

The Tories said Labour's suggestion that families should always get a receipt for cash-in-hand jobs revealed a 'complete lack of understanding' about business.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said it was 'absurd'.

He said: 'I don't think anybody in the country probably does that unless they sit down and they do it as part of a process; in other words, if you are employing somebody in which the objective is paying them cash as a process of your business, then of course I suspect most businesses do keep some kind of record, that's the right thing to do.

'But if you have a one-off payment for something and you pay cash, I shouldn't think anybody in the country does that necessarily ... what it exemplifies is Labour's complete lack of understanding about how business works and, actually, how people get by.' 

Charlotte Leslie promised to hand back cash from a businessman accused of tax-avoidance

Conservative Party high command was accused of intervening to stop a Tory MP handing back a donation from a businessman accused of tax avoidance.

Charlotte Leslie pledged on Monday to return £5,000 given by Hugh Sloane, the multimillionaire co-founder of an investment management company, Sloane Robinson. A tribunal had ruled that the firm had operated a tax avoidance scheme.

The MP for Bristol North West originally told The Times: 'Nobody wants to take money that's not whiter than white.'

But just hours later, she retracted the promise. A party source said: 'Charlotte realised she had made a mistake. She realised she had to change her position.'

Last night a Labour MP wrote to Miss Leslie to ask her whether she had been pressurised into the U-turn following arm-twisting from Tory Central Office.

Phil Wilson pointed out that Mr Sloane and his business associate had given the Conservative Party as a whole almost £1million. If Miss Leslie had handed her donation back, it would have put pressure on the whole party to do the same.

The issue highlights the thorny issue of political donations. Labour say the Tories are too dependent on 'dodgy' financiers for funding, while the Conservatives say Labour are in hock to the unions.

Miss Leslie received the personal donation from Mr Sloane in December.

His company, Sloane Robinson, was ordered to pay £13million in unpaid tax and national insurance contributions to HM Revenue and Customs in 2012 after a tribunal ruled against a tax scheme it had since 2004.

The Crown argued that the share scheme was 'nothing more than the mechanism for the delivery of bonuses' of £24million to Mr Sloane; George Robinson, the company's co-founder; and two other directors.

The tribunal presiding on the case concluded that the structures under investigation were 'merely money-box companies serving an essentially mechanical purpose.'

Mr Sloane has also given donations of £10,000 each to Angie Bray, the Tory MP for Ealing Central and Action; and Nicola Blackwood, Tory MP for Oxford West and Abingdon. The pair, who are both defending marginal seats, do not intend to return the money.
