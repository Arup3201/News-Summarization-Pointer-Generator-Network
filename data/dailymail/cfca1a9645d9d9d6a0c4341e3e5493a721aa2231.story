The parents of an eight-year-old schoolboy in remission from cancer are facing a school holiday fine for going on a charity-funded trip to Center Parcs.

Max Davies, from Beighton in Sheffield, has been battling cancer for more than a year and was offered the free trip, which is taking place this week, along with his 11-year-old sister Lily and their parents.

But school chiefs refused permission to allow the youngsters to be absent from classes and have threatened the family with a £60 fine.

The trip has been paid for by Amy's Retreat, a Sheffield-based charity which pays for breaks for families affected by cancer.

Max is currently in remission following intensive treatment for combat non-Hodgkins lymphoma after being diagnosed in March last year.

Parents Sarah and Craig Davies say they were 'delighted' when they were invited on the trip to Center Parcs, in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire.

Last winter, during his treatment, the family were given permission to take the children out of school for a dream trip to Lapland.

Now, the children's schools - Brook House Juniors and Westfield secondary school, both in Sheffield - say no final decision has yet been made on whether to impose the penalty.

But Mrs Davies said the schools are failing to show any compassion by refusing to give permission for the holiday.

She said: 'Max was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma in his bowel in March last year, and has fought really hard and is now in remission.

'It's great that Amy's Retreat have offered to pay for this break, which they want us to take in term time as it uses up less of their funds.

'But when we approached Brook House they initially refused the time off, saying Max had already enjoyed a once-in-a-lifetime trip in school time when he went to Lapland for a day last year.'

Max won a SuperKids award last year from his local newspaper for his bravery while battling cancer

Mrs Davies says if the fine is imposed for Max and Lily she and her husband will refuse to pay it

Mrs Davies said she knew schools were potentially left with no room to manoeuvre due to tough Government guidelines, which only allow extra time off in 'exceptional circumstances'.

She added: 'I just wish they'd use their common sense more than anything and show a bit of understanding. We are going to refuse to pay the fines if they are imposed.'

Brook House headteacher Mark Hinchliffe and Westfield headteacher Andy Ireland issued a joint statement on the case.

In it, they said: 'We take the welfare and health of all our children seriously and are thrilled that Max is now in remission from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

'Max and his family have been supported by his friends and teachers at Brook House during his treatment and we were happy to approve time out of school last year when Max was offered a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Lapland.

Brook House Junior school (pictured) says it has not yet decided whether to impose the fine for Max's absence

'No decision has yet been made by both schools about whether the family will incur a fine for an unauthorised school absence following their trip to Center Parcs.

'However, both schools are guided by the Government regulation relating to term-time holidays, and we would support the principle that all children should attend school consistently so they can benefit from the learning we provide.'

Max won a SuperKids award, run by his local newspaper The Star, last year for his bravery while fighting for his life against cancer.

Since Michael Gove introduced the holiday ban in September last year, more than 60,000 families have been fined by councils for taking children out of school without approval.

Under new guidelines parents are able to take their children out of school during term time for special occasions in a relaxation of the holiday ban introduced by Michael Gove in September last year.

After a string of controversial cases, the new guidelines drawn up by head teachers make it clear when families can take children away from classes The rules have been backed by new Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, and will allow children to attend family weddings or funerals, recover after a personal or family crisis, attend a religious event or visiting a relative who is seriously ill

Under the new guidelines parents will still be prevented from taking advantage of cheap holiday breaks in term time  Until September 2013 heads could grant up to 10 days leave a year for family holidays in 'special circumstances'

But under Mr Gove head teachers could grant absence outside school holidays only in 'exceptional circumstances'

It leaves parents facing fines of £60 per pupil if they take children out of school for a cheap term time holiday and those who refuse to pay can be fined up to £2,500 by the courts and could even be jailed for up to three months

The rules are aimed at preventing youngsters missing vital chunks of their education, but became one of Mr Gove's most unpopular policies

In the year before the new legislation was introduced, the number of parents hit with fines soared by nearly 70 per cent

Some 63,837 penalties were issued to parents in the academic year to July 2014 in England, compared with 37,650 fines throughout the previous 12 months
