Police are continuing to make inquiries into an alleged biting incident involving Dagenham midfielder Joss Labadie.

The 24-year-old, who has been banned for biting before, was accused of sinking his teeth into the hand of Stevenage defender Ronnie Henry during Saturday's League Two fixture at the Lamex Stadium.

The pair clashed near the touchline when Henry tried to wrestle the ball out of Labadie's arms after play had been stopped. Henry immediately appeared to signal to the nearby assistant referee that he had been bitten.

Boro manager Graham Westley revealed after the match that Henry, 31, had suffered 'a nasty injury' and had 'nearly lost his finger'.

Dagenham have since said that Labadie denies the accusation.

A Hertfordshire Police spokesperson said: 'Hertfordshire Constabulary is aware of an alleged incident that took place between two football players during the Dagenham vs Stevenage match at the Stevenage FC ground on Saturday, March 22.

'Police are making inquiries into the incident.'

Labadie was fined £2,000 and banned for 10 games for biting Chesterfield's Ollie Banks while playing for Torquay in February 2014.

In November 2010, Luis Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and a fine by his then-club Ajax for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal.

Suarez then bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic - his second victim - and the FA charged the then-Liverpool striker with violent conduct. He received a 10-game ban and a fine from his club.

Then, Suarez was found guilty of biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup. 

The Barcelona forward was banned from all 'football-related activities' for four months and received a nine international match suspension.
