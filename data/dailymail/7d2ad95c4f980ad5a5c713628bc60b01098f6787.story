A teenager has been charged with the murder of a 15-year-old cyclist who was stabbed to death in a street attack.

Alan Cartwright was attacked as he rode along the Caledonian Road in Islington, north London with friends last Friday night. 

Police have since charged Joshua Williams with murder and conspiracy to rob and the 18-year-old, of north London, will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' court tomorrow.

The teenager has been described as a someone who 'wouldn't hurt a fly' and well-known in the area in north London

An 18-year-old man remains in custody and a 17-year-old boy and a 21-year-old man - both arrested in relation to the incident - have been bailed.

Alan, a pupil at Holloway High School, was wearing a blue body warmer and grey jumper at the front of his group of friends moments before he was attacked at about 7.30pm.

Just days ago Alan's mother Michelle made an emotional appeal for information about her son's death.

Alan’s mother and sister described the Army cadet and Celtic and Arsenal fan as a 'joker' who loved bikes and never caused any trouble.

Fighting back tears, Alan’s mother Michelle Watson, 39, said: 'He always made you laugh about anything and everything. He was just the funny one out of his friends.'

She had earlier led an emotional tribute to her son on Facebook writing: 'Our baby boy xxxxxxx xxxxxxx x xxxxxxx RIP we love you always.'

After his death, friends took to Twitter to pay tribute to Alan, known by the nickname Little Al. 

The teenager’s sister, Cherrie Smith, 21, broke down when she spoke of him not being there when she gets married.

She had organised a candlelit vigil for her brother on Saturday night, near to the spot where he died.
