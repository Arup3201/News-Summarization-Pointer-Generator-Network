A teenage thug who killed a 'heroic' off-duty police officer with a single punch in an unprovoked attack was today jailed for just three-and-half years.

Dale Dixon, 19, attacked Chris Findley, 33, as he was walking home from a night out with friends in Wolverhampton, West Midlands.

The officer, who worked for West Midlands Police, was rushed to hospital after banging his head on the pavement as he fell but he died ten days later.

Victim: PC Chris Findlay, 33, was walking home from a night out with friends when he was attacked by Dale Dixon. He died 10 days later in hospital

CCTV footage of the attack showed PC Findley exchanging words with two of Dixon's female friends outside a city centre bar.

One of the women kicked out and threw punches at him as he calmly walked away before Dixon sprinted towards him and punched him.

Relatives of PC Findlay gasped in court as the graphic footage showed him falling backwards and falling into the pavement.

Dixon then wandered around the road with his one hand on his head before putting him in the recovery position and calling an ambulance.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the attacker, who later fled the scene, punched the police officer with such force that it broke his nose in three places.

PC Findlay, who was left with a fractured skull following the attack on January 28, died on February 7 after suffering swelling to his brain.

Dixon, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in a young offenders' institution - meaning he could be free in under two years.

Jailing him, Judge John Warner said: 'What's clear is that Christopher Findley was simply making his way down the street when he was confronted by one of two women that Dixon was with.

'He was not causing any trouble at all. Whatever it was, one of the women would simply not leave him alone.

'He was obviously trying to leave the scene as best he could. If she had simply let things go I very much doubt we would be where we are at court today.

'You can be seen running towards him at quite a pace. You were clearly going to launch some kind of assault upon him.

'When he turned his head, possibly having heard you running behind him, you hit him full in the face.

'You called the emergency services and subsequently left the scene in a taxi.

'You are a young man of a big build and the blow was hard enough to break his nose in three places and knock him out. An innocent man has unnecessarily and tragically lost his life.

'You had no intention of causing really serious injury let alone anything worse but as a result of your violent action a man has died.'

Prosecutor Gareth Walters told the court PC Findley was well-liked and had been out drinking with friends in Wolverhampton on the night he died.

He said: 'It was not a spontaneous assault. It was a severe blow shown by the triple fracture and he (the police officer) was unconscious before he hit the ground.

'There was nothing at all justifying the assault by the defendant.'

William Dudley, mitigating, said that Dixon, of Wednesfield, West Midlands, was a man of previous good character.

'This
is a young man, 19 now, 18 at the time of the incident with no previous
conviction,' he said. 'This is not a gentleman who is shrugging his 
shoulders. It had affected him deeply.

'What
the defendant will have to live with is the fact about what he has 
done. That's the greatest punishment that can be suffered upon Mr 
Dixon.'

morning scuffle with Dixon and two women outside Divine Bar in 
Wolverhampton at around 4:30am on January 28

PC Findlay's mother Jackie Tabrett, 69, said she would never come to terms with the killing.

'Not a day has gone by since his death when I have not thought about him,' she said.

'He was a police officer for which I was very proud of him, he joined to keep people safe and protect them from harm and to put those individuals responsible for committing crime into the justice system.

'It's hard to believe that one of those people is responsible for taking my son's life.

'It still hasn't sunk in that I'll never see my son again and all that I have now are photographs and treasured memories. I don't think I'll ever in my lifetime come to terms with what has happened.

'The sentence handed out today cannot bring my son back, no sentence can do that.'

Chris's friends collectively said in a statement that the police officer's killer would go free before he was even as old as the man he killed.

'Chris Findley or Fin as he was affectionately known by his many friends was a wonderful kind and considerate person with an infectious personality and incredible sense of humour,' the statement said.

'The ordeal of watching Fin's battle for survival after this mindless attack was an emotional rollercoaster.

'The sentence handed out today will not bring Fin back, and Dale Dixon will be released and walking the streets of Wolverhampton again before he is anywhere near to reaching the age of the man whose life he took.'

Chief Superintendent Mark Robinson, from West Midlands Police, added: 'Our thoughts are with Chris's family, friends and colleagues today.

'This was a tragic case which resulted in the death of a valued member of the police service in Sandwell.

'He has previously been described fondly by his colleagues as a selfless and humble man, always watching out for those in need of cheering up, which he achieved through his warm, infectious personality and sense of humour.

'Chris was a proactive, hard-working officer who was a credit to the service and the communities of Sandwell. He will be sadly missed.'
