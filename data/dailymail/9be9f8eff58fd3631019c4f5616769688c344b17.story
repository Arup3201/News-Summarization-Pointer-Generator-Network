Jennifer Fortier, 28, testified she ran into Aaron Hernandez while she was out with a friend in Boston two nights before he is accused of murdering Odin Lloyd

Hernandez, 25, is accused of shooting Lloyd. He is being tried at Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts. If convicted, Hernandez faces a maximum penalty of life in prison

Fortier said he kissed her in a bedroom and then she stopped him and left. Two days later, he paid her $250

Fortier said she ran into Hernandez on the night of of June 14, 2013, when she and a girlfriend were out in Boston.

After they left with Hernandez, Lloyd and a third man, they eventually wound up in his apartment in Franklin. 

The prosecution commonly refers to that apartment as a 'flophouse'.

They were in a bedroom at the apartment when Hernandez kissed her. 

Hernandez had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots before he was released 

She said: 'I pushed him away,' 

'I told him, "I'm your Nanny. I can't do this."

'He understood and said it was OK.'

Fortier did admit that she initially kissed Hernandez back before rebuffing him and departing.  

Two nights later, Fortier said she was babysitting at the home of Hernandez and his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins when two men identified as Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz arrived around midnight while the couple were out.

Prosecutors have alleged the three men picked up  Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating Jenkins' sister, at his Boston home early on June 17, 2013, and drove him to the industrial area where his bullet-riddled body was found later that day.

Hernandez, 25, is accused of fatally shooting Lloyd and is being tried at Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts. 

Wallace and Ortiz also face murder charges and will be tried separately. 

All three men have pleaded not guilty.

If convicted, Hernandez, a former tight-end for the New England Patriots, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.

Surveillance video played in court showed Wallace and Ortiz arriving at the house in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, and Fortier answering the door. 

The $250 sum equates to a rate of $62.50 an hour, a marked increase of Fortier's usual pay of $20 per hour

They arrived in what prosecutors say was a rented Nissan Altima that they later drove to the crime scene. 

Fortier said Hernandez or Jenkins called her cell phone within 10-15 minutes of their arrival, and that she handed the phone to Wallace, who walked into the kitchen to talk before giving her the phone back.

After Hernandez and Jenkins returned, Hernandez went upstairs quickly before leaving with the men at around 1am, she said.

Fortier said she talked with Jenkins for about an hour before leaving. 

Hernandez had a $41 million contract with the Patriots. He was released from the team hours after his arrest in June, 2013.
