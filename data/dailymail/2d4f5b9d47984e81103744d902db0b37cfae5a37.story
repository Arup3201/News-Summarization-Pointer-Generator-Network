Schoolchildren are being taken to a jail whose inmates include rapists and murderers to deter them from a life of crime.

Wiltshire Police are organising the trips to Erlestoke Prison, near Devizes, where local pupils aged 15 and 16 are shown cells and given a talk by inmates.

A deputy headmaster who accompanied three children to the prison earlier this month said: ‘This kind of experience teaches them about the consequences of breaking the law.’

Richard Thomson, from Notton House School in Chippenham, said that although his school catered for boys with emotional and behavioural problems, the pupils on the trip were studying justice systems and had never been in trouble with the law.

Nonetheless, he said the talk by the inmates had been ‘a salutary lesson for the boys’.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘This is a police initiative aimed at reducing crime among young people. The young people do not come into contact with the general prison population. Safety of the children during visits is paramount and they are accompanied at all times.’
