This is one way to deal with the 'polar vortex'.

Three Minnesota brothers have spent 95 hours building a giant shark with the snow dumped outside their parents New Brighton home.

Putting all other snowmen to shame, Austin, Connor and Trevor Bartz began crafting the bone-chilling shark on December 3 - and are happy with their handiwork.

Snow sculptors: It took teenagers Austin, Connor and Trevor Bartz of New Brighton about 95 hours to build the shark

'We like to see peopleâ€™s enjoyment, and we like to see people smile, 
take pictures,' Connor Bartz told CBS Minnesota.

The brothers posted a video showing how they made the sculpture on their YouTube channel, Bartz Outdoors.

The unique sculpture is the latest snow art created by the Bartz family. The boys previously built a giant pufferfish and a walrus.

And with the 'polar vortex' hitting the Midwest snowbelt this year, there should be ample opportunity for the brothers to construct an even bigger water creature before the season is over.
