Vigil: Nick Fletcher (pictured with his niece), 27, had only just moved into a two-bedroom flat when the accident happened in high winds on Monday

The family of a popular shipbroker fighting for life in hospital after being struck by a telegraph pole were today keeping a bedside vigil for him.

Amateur rugby player Nick Fletcher, 27, had only just moved into a two-bedroom flat when the accident happened in high winds on Monday.

He was knocked unconscious and suffered a cardiac arrest which left him in a pool of blood in a street in Wandsworth, south-west London.

Today Mr Fletcher, who was born in Bromley, Kent, was in a critical but stable condition at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London.

He is one of four children of Philip, 63, and Anne Fletcher, 57. His mother, of Sevenoaks, Kent, called him ‘the nicest guy you could ever meet’.

Mrs Fletcher said today: ‘We are all devastated. We are concentrating on his condition rather than how this happened. He is such a lovely boy and has so many friends.

'He is a strong person and a fighter. We are praying that he pulls through. If anyone can, he can. The hospital have been fantastic and the staff are doing all they can. We just have to keep hoping.’

Mr Fletcher, who works for the electronic brokerage firm Icap in the City, was just yards from his new home when the incident happened. He has not yet finished moving in.

British Telecom, the Metropolitan Police and the Health and Safety Executive were all investigating the accident.

Mr Fletcher was a keen amateur rugby player with London Cornish RFC, and Dickon Moon, head coach of the team, said: ‘Everyone at the club wishes him well. He's a top bloke and is very well liked.

'We are waiting for news of his condition like everyone. His family are probably keeping those details close to their chests, which I absolutely understand given what has happened.’

An Icap spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts are with Nick and his family. We wish him a full and speedy recovery.’

Meanwhile, Britain was forecast to start warming up again this week as passengers on cross-Channel journeys endured the worst of the travel disruption today caused by the continuing mid-March cold snap.

Channel Tunnel transit firm Eurostar cancelled 10 services and there were delays of up to two hours on trains that were able to run, as well as problems on Eurotunnel services at Folkestone, Kent.

But forecasters said that although this week will still be cold, today was expected to see highs of 6C, while temperatures could reach 7C by Thursday, 8C on Friday and 9C in time for the weekend.

Meanwhile on the roads there were long tailbacks on the M20 at Folkestone as police put lorries into holding positions as part of Operation Stack, and Jersey and Guernsey airports were shut.

Conditions were still hazardous on major roads, including the A19 and A170 in North Yorkshire and the A947 in Aberdeenshire, while drivers on the M9 in Stirling had to contend with sheep on the road.

But with temperatures creeping up from mind-numbingly cold to merely fairly chilly, travelling for most road and rail users was far less of a problem than earlier in the week, especially on Monday.

It was continuing bad weather in 
northern France that caused today's problems for Eurostar - which, as 
well as cancelling 10 trains today, advised passengers not to travel 
unless they needed to.

Due to the hold-ups on the approaches to Folkestone, there were queues for the passenger and freight shuttles on Eurotunnel.

Three day forecast: Snow showers are expected to move north throughout the day on Wednesday. Tomorrow will be mainly clear and dry before rain moves in across the country on Friday

Further along the Kent coast, 
officials from the Port of Dover advised passengers to leave extra time 
for journeys because of a backlog of traffic entering the port.

The cold weather was set to continue throughout the day, with temperatures between 2C (35F) and 6C (43F) but feeling colder.

Gemma Plumb, a forecaster with 
MeteoGroup, said snow showers were forecast for parts of Scotland and 
eastern parts of England, especially along the North Sea coast.

But that snow was unlikely to settle 
and the snowfall that caused chaos across south east England and the 
Channel Islands yesterday had cleared, she added.

She said: ‘It won't be as cold as 
yesterday but it's still colder than average for this time of year. 
Tonight there will be lows of -5C (23F) to -7C (19F) across the whole 
country, so it is still really cold.’

Thousands of travellers endured a 
miserable day yesterday as the bitterly cold weather cause havoc for 
road, rail, sea and air journeys.

Kent and Sussex were worst hit as roads 
were blocked by snow and huge queues built up. Jersey Airport was closed
all day and UK passengers were delayed by bad weather at European 
airports.

Five hundred passengers on an Irish 
Ferries sailing, including around 300 French students, were stranded in 
rough seas off the coast of France.

They were finally able to dock at the
fifth attempt at Cherbourg after spending almost 20 hours at sea, 
arriving at their destination almost 24 hours late.

Kent Police dealt with hundreds of 
calls from motorists reporting collisions, broken-down vehicles and 
abandoned cars as drivers were unable to continue their journeys, 
prompting warnings to travel only if necessary.

Elsewhere there were strong winds 
across large parts of the UK creating hazardous conditions. In 
Wandsworth, south west London, a 27-year-old man was left with serious 
head injuries after a telegraph pole was blown down.

One witness told the London Evening 
Standard: ‘I saw the pole falling forwards and a person being struck by 
the pole. I think he was in a very bad way, but the ambulance came very 
quickly.’

Yesterday, the jagged stump of the 
pole was surrounded by three traffic cones and local residents told of 
their shock at seeing the victim on the road as he was attended to by 
ambulance crews.

Claire 
Whicello, 43, said: ‘I initially thought it was a car accident. When I 
went down to look I saw a few cars on the side - I thought they had run 
into each other. It wasn't until this morning that I found out what had 
happened. It's awful, it's dreadful for the poor man - I can't believe 
it.'

Meanwhile, Met Office 
forecaster Emma Sharples yesterday evening told MailOnline a yellow snow
warning remained in place for north and eastern parts of Scotland, 
through the north east of England and down through Yorkshire, 
Lincolnshire and into The Wash.

She said the warning was due to last until 11am this morning.

Ms
Sharples added: 'We are still having showers running down the east 
coast, so there's potential through that warning period for there to be 2
to 5cms of snow, but locally up to 10cms, but this will be mainly for 
higher ground.

'Elsewhere, away from these locations, we have a fair bit of brighter weather but there will be a scattering of wintry showers.'

Meanwhile,
hundreds of passengers stranded in rough seas off the coast of France 
were later trapped at harbour as the ship's doors failed.

Misfortune struck the 500 Cherbourg-bound travellers twice as the Irish Ferries sailing from Ireland, expected to be an overnight journey, turned into a two-day calamity.

Treacherous conditions in the English Channel prevented the Oscar Wilde - the company's luxury flagship - from docking at the French port as scheduled on Monday at 2pm.

But when it finally berthed after five attempts today - 24 hours later than expected - the seafarers, anxious to disembark, were forced to remain onboard a further four hours when the boat's bow doors jammed.

Irish Ferries blamed 'a hydraulic failure' for preventing them from letting passengers - including 245 French pupils returning from a school trip to Ireland - back onto dry land.

Normally in such circumstances a ship would sail back out of its berth and reverse in again so passengers could alight through the stern, or rear, door.

But because conditions in the usually busy crossing remained dangerous, harbour authorities warned the ship's captain against moving the ferry. An Irish Ferries spokesman said all the passengers were 'perfectly safe'.

Plans for the ferry to return to Ireland last night were cancelled and a scheduled sailing from County Wexford back to France today has also been axed. Passengers due to travel on the sailings are being contacted while alternative arrangements are being made.
