Next week’s FIFA congress in Sao Paulo looks increasingly problematic for president Sepp Blatter with the decision to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia now under attack as well as the Qatar fiasco.

A global campaign calling for a boycott of World Cup sponsors Budweiser, Visa, Kia Motors and Sony is being led by United with Ukraine, a human rights organisation based in Canada opposing Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula.

A spokesman for UwU said: ‘We have this opportunity standing right in front of us to have FIFA strip Russia of its World Cup. I do not believe the sponsors want to align their brands with Vladimir Putin.’

The anti-Russia protest is extremely well funded, as it is financed by Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company for the fabulously rich American financier Warren Buffett.

Meanwhile, the Qatar controversy became yet more toxic with an Iranian TV website claiming that America’s spy agency, the NSA, and its British counterpart, GCHQ, were allegedly involved in the leak of FIFA emails and investigative reports to further destabilise the 2022 World Cup hosts.

Roy Hodgson, who accuses the media of having an obsession with Wayne Rooney, can use his meet-the-fans experience in Miami to back that up.

Despite Rooney’s position in the England team being a matter of much debate, supporters quizzing Hodgson in The Burger and Beer Joint didn’t ask one question about Wayne.

One fan said afterwards that England followers weren’t that bothered about Wayne as his last good international tournament for England was in 2004.

Obsessions: Hodgson says the English media focus too much on Wayne Rooney

Former Liverpool chief executive Christian Purslow, on holiday in Florida, has been around the England hotel and watched the squad training on the Barry University campus with the invited fans who included Vauxhall dealers and Club Wembley patrons.

Purslow, who has never been known to refuse a TV or radio interview, will not be able to resist pontificating on England if asked. And more good news is that talkative Christian is looking for another top admin job in football.

The sponsorship perimeter boards around the Barry University training ground had a ‘Good Luck England’ message in place of a William Hill promotion because of gambling advertising regulations in the United States. But it highlighted once again the FA’s double standards in having a high-profile betting partner when everyone involved in the sport is forbidden to gamble on football worldwide.

Touching down: David Beckham arrives in Miami

Becks needs LeBron

David Beckham, who arrived in Miami on Friday night, is planning soon to list the key backers of his group’s proposal for a new waterside stadium for their Major League Soccer franchise next door to the Miami Heat basketball arena.

And the major speculation in Miami is whether Beckham’s official cheerleaders will include Heat superstar LeBron James, whose late attack of cramp led to defeat by the San Antonio Spurs in the opening game of the NBA finals.

James, Beckham’s close friend, has long been linked with joining his ownership group. And certainly LeBron’s patronage would greatly help reverse the negative publicity around the  stadium in a celebrity-obsessed city.

Beckham, sure to be courtside for game three of the NBA finals in Miami next week, said: ‘If LeBron comes in that will be amazing because people love him in this city. He’s not just a great sportsman but a great man.’

BBC Sport consider the World Cup important enough to send an army of 272 personnel to Brazil — even including a specialist Twitter operative, who could more efficiently operate from Manchester. And BBC3 broadcast this week to 571,000 viewers a ludicrous programme — updated from 2010 — listing England’s worst ever players, one of whom, Vinnie Jones, represented Wales.

A Beeb spokeswoman said it was a light-hearted show and the social media chief had a crucial integrating output role to play in Brazil.
