Speech: Policing Minister Damian Green yesterday called for the private sector to be given a greater role in police work

The new policing minister yesterday called for the private sector to be given a greater role in police work, even as it emerged G4S had lost more than half its fee for the Olympics security fiasco.

Damian Green, in his first speech since being appointed in last week's reshuffle, said partnerships between police forces and security firms would save money and improve services.

Some forces have considered transferring functions to contractors in response to steep budget cuts, but G4S's handling of Olympic security has led to calls to put the move on hold.

Games organisers Locog yesterday laid out the firm’s catalogue of failings before MPs.

On its worst day, G4S provided less than two thirds of the required staff numbers, Locog’s chief executive Paul Deighton told the Home Affairs Select Committee.

During the Games some two-thirds of venues were left with a 15 per cent deficit in guard numbers – a level viewed by organisers as critical, he added.

Mr Deighton, who last week was made a peer and will join the Government as a Treasury minister, also revealed that only £90million of the £236million contracted fee had been paid to G4S so far.

Despite the G4S debacle, Mr Green tried to give fresh impetus to the drive towards privatisation in his speech candidates for November's first police and crime commissioner elections

He also urged the first holders of the newly created role to increase collaboration between constabularies.

'I hope you will all consider the value of private sector partnering to achieve both cost savings and better services for the public,' Mr Green said at a national briefing day held by the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners in London.

'Every pound saved means a pound saved to be used on the front line putting officers on the streets.

'I want more officers to be out there getting on with the job of fighting crime - we all know they can't do it if they are bogged down with red tape and form filling.'

He said the police would remain 'a public service accountable to the people', adding that decisions on business partnering would be taken by elected commissioner so people are given a say.

'I'm sure police and crime commissioners will also want to exploit the benefits that collaboration brings to their forces, and will be guided by the duty to collaborate where it is in the interests of the efficiency and effectiveness of their own or another police force,' he added.

G4S is bidding for a series of contracts to take over civilian jobs in police forces, including a bid to part run a police station in Lincolnshire.

The company only told Olympics organisers it would fail to supply enough staff just a fortnight before the Games began, forcing ministers to draft in thousands of soldiers to plug the gaps.

London 2012 chairman Sebastian Coe has told the Home Affairs Select Committee that overcoming the failure of G4S to deliver on their contract was the biggest challenge he faced in delivering a successful Games.

Buck stops here: G4S chief executive Nick 
Buckles gives evidence on Olympic security to an earlier hearing of the Home Affairs Select Committee in June

G4S chief executive Nick Buckles said he could draw his 28-year career with the group to a close if he is found to be accountable for the company’s failure to provide the guards for the Olympics.

Appearing before the same group of MPs yesterday, Buckles admitted the buck stopped with him.

The company has brought in forensic accountants PwC to help with an investigation into what went wrong.

One of the aims of the report, which is expected later this month, is to find out which G4S executives contributed to the failure. Mr Buckles told MPs: ‘I am the chief executive. If a contract goes wrong I take the pain for that.

‘I will wait to see the outcome of the review.’

He added: ‘I have been with the group for 28 years, I have been chief executive 10 years. It’s been a big investment for my whole career.

‘It is only after me talking to the board and the board talking to shareholders that that decision will be made.’

Payments to G4S were stopped within 48 hours of the firm admitting on July 11 that it would not be able to provide all 10,400 guards on time.

The contract had been worth £284million when signed last December but was scaled back to £236million, Deighton said.

Executives at G4S will lock horns with Locog to negotiate over how much of the remaining £150m the company receives.

It already said it expects to make a £50m loss on the contract.
