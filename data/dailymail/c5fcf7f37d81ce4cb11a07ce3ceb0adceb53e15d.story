Symbolic salute: The mystery veteran who stood on an overpass in Lehi, Ohio, has revealed himself as former Army helicopter pilot Jonathan Walker 

When a soldier stood on an overpass on Veteran's Day, motorists were left baffled.

Then as he saluted, drivers in Lehi, Utah, started to honk their horns in support while some even got out of their cars to shake his hand.

Now the anonymous serviceman has identified himself as former Army helicopter pilot Jonathan Walker.

The 43-year-old, who served in the military from 1992 to 2000, hoped his symbolic gesture will inspire others to do something similar, and set up the website Standing Quietly in a bid to encourage future events.

In just 24 hours, it got more than 800 hits and an overwhelming number of civilians writing to him with their heart-wrenching tales of war, loss and patriotism. 

'I had no idea what a reaction my small action would get,' the married father-of-three told MailOnline. 

'I have felt for years that our Veterans need more support. It has been a gradual feeling but this year I felt it needed to be addressed.

'Veterans belong to us, the people. If they are deployed for whatever reason, it's on us to support them and give them a proper homecoming.

'You can build hospitals and make donations, but there is nothing like somebody standing up for you or shaking your hand. That is a different kind of healing.'

Walker was a member of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment - 'I still treasure my Cavalry Stetson hat' - and saw vast swathes of his friends deployed to war zones, some more than four times.

However, with few large military bases in Utah, he says many civilians appear to feel disconnected from Veterans Day. 

It is something he hopes to change.

'If veterans are not made to feel proud of what they did, it's a hard psychological barrier to get over. 

'I'd like to close off the bridge for three hours on the morning of Veterans Day every year and get as many vets as possible standing up there with me. 

'I've already had about 45 vets say they will be there next year, there were even people with no connection to the military that want to join.'

A number of people made their way onto the bridge to shake Walker's hand in gratitude. 

And alongside a flurry of support for next year's event, Walker has also received dozens of emotional emails from veterans and veterans' families. 

Gaining attention: Walker, who served in the military for seven-and-a-half years has set up the website Standing Quietly in a bid to plan events and stunts in the future

Staying strong: Walker has also posted other pictures of veterans performing similar gestures and hopes more will do the same in the future 

One woman described how her father was driven to alcohol after returning to a hostile nation following the Vietnam War. 

'So many of them experienced the demons; the demons that are difficult to escape without support.'  

Writing on Standing Quietly, Walker said: 'I am trying to stay true to the original reason I walked onto that overpass. I want to bring attention to Veterans. 

'I think through this we can help Veterans. I am making this site to try to further that goal. Here we can unite and plan future events for Veterans Day 2015.'
