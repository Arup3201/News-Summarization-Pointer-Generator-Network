A Missouri who killed a jeweler during a 1991 robbery was executed 
for the crime late Wednesday, marking the state's third lethal injection
 in as many months.

Herbert Smulls was executed at the state 
prison in Bonne Terre, and pronounced dead at 10:20 p.m. The 56-year-old
 had been convicted of killing Stephen Honickman and badly injuring his 
wife, Florence, during a robbery at their jewelry shop in suburban St. 
Louis on July 27, 1991.

The U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay 
late Tuesday, shortly before the scheduled 12:01 a.m. execution, after 
Smulls' attorneys filed an appeal challenging the state's refusal to 
disclose where it obtained its execution drug. The high court cleared 
all appeals on Wednesday night, though Smulls' attorney had filed 
another less than 30 minutes before he was pronounced dead.

Defense
 attorneys argued that the state's refusal to name the compounding 
pharmacy supplying the pentobarbital made it impossible to know whether 
the drug could cause pain and suffering during the execution. The state 
maintained that the company was part of the execution team, so its name 
was protected from public disclosure.

Prosecutors said the arguments were simply a smoke screen aimed at sparing a murderer's life.

'It
 was a horrific crime,' St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said 
on Tuesday. 'With all the other arguments that the opponents of the 
death penalty are making, it's simply to try to divert the attention 
from what this guy did, and why he deserves to be executed.'

Smulls
 had already served time in prison for robbery when he went to F&M 
Crown Jewels in Chesterfield and told the Honickmans, who owned the 
store, that he wanted to buy a diamond for his fiancee. He took 
15-year-old Norman Brown with him.

Smulls began shooting 
inside the shop, and he and Brown took rings and watches -- including 
those that Florence Honickman was wearing. She was shot in the side and 
the arm, and feigned death while lying in a pool of her own blood.

Brown
 was convicted in 1993 of first-degree murder and other charges, and 
sentenced to life without parole. Smulls got the death penalty.

Smulls' execution was the state's third since it began using pentobarbital as its lethal injection drug.

Missouri
 and other states had used a three-drug execution method for decades, 
but pharmaceutical companies stopped selling the drugs in recent years 
for use in executions. Missouri eventually switched to pentobarbital, 
which was used to execute serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin in November
 and Allen Nicklasson in December. Neither inmate showed outward signs 
of distress.

The state said it obtained its supply of the drug
 from a compounding pharmacy, which custom-mix drugs for individual 
clients. They are not subject to oversight by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, though they are regulated by states.

Smulls' 
attorney, Cheryl Pilate, said she and her defense team used information 
obtained through open records requests and publicly available documents 
to determine that state obtained its drugs from The Apothecary Shoppe, a
 compounding pharmacy based in Tulsa, Okla. In a statement, the company 
would neither confirm nor deny that it made the Missouri drug.

Pilate contends that the state's secrecy makes it impossible to know whether the drug could cause pain and suffering during the execution process.

Smulls had already served prison time for robbery when, on July 27, 1991, he went to F&M Crown Jewels in Chesterfield and told the owners, Stephen and Florence Honickman, that he wanted to buy a diamond for his fiancee. He took 15-year-old Norman Brown with him.

Once in the shop, Smulls began shooting. The robbers took rings and watches, including those that Florence Honickman was wearing.

She was shot in the side and the arm, and feigned death while lying in a pool of her own blood but survived. Her 51-year-old husband died.

Police stopped Smulls 15 minutes later, and they found stolen jewelry and weapons in his car. Florence Honickman identified the assailants. Brown was convicted in 1993 of first-degree murder and other charges, and sentenced to life without parole. Smulls got the death penalty.

Missouri had used a three-drug execution process since 1989, until the drug makers stopped selling those drugs for executions. Missouri eventually switched late last year to pentobarbital. Pentobarbital was used to execute two Missouri inmates late last year, and neither showed visible signs of distress.

Compounding pharmacies custom-mix drugs for clients and are not subject to oversight by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, though they are regulated by states.

On Tuesday, Pilate said that previous testimony from a prison official indicates the state stores the drug at room temperatures, which could taint the drug and potentially cause it to lose its effectiveness.

Pilate also said she and her defense team used information obtained through open records requests and publicly available documents to determine that the compounding pharmacy is The Apothecary Shoppe, based in Tulsa, Okla. In a statement, The Apothecary Shoppe would neither confirm nor deny that it makes the Missouri drug.

Also on Tuesday, Missouri Senate Democratic Leader Jolie Justus introduced legislation that would create an 11-member commission responsible for setting the state's execution procedure. She said ongoing lawsuits and secrecy about the state's current lethal injection method should drive a change in protocol.
