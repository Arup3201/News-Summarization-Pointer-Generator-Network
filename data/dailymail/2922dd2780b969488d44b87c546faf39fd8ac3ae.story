Researchers have unveiled a DNA database for rhino horn they hope will cut down on poaching.

The Scottish Government has joined the fight against the illegal trade in rhinoceros horn by setting up a DNA database which will help trace the origin of stolen horns seized by police.

Rhinoceros horn now fetches more than its weight in gold on the black market and it is not just animals living in the wild that are being targeted by criminals.

More than 50 thefts were reported from museums, galleries and auction houses in Europe in 2011.

Scientists at Sasa (Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture) are to send out sampling kits to museums and zoos across the UK to create Scotland's first rhino horn database.

A study has shown that DNA profiles can be produced from museum horns that are more than 100 years old.

The aim of the Defra-funded project is to protect exhibits and also live rhinos in zoos from criminal gangs who steal and sell rhino horn for thousands of pounds.

Environment Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: 'The illegal trade in rhino horn has become not only a threat to these magnificent but sadly very rare animals in the wild, but also to our museums and zoos.

'The work at Sasa will help the police to crack down on the criminals who are beneath contempt and who, seemingly, will stop at nothing to exploit these endangered animals for profit.'

Lucy Webster, who is co-ordinating the project at Sasa, said: 'While we hope that the horns in museums and zoos in the UK are safe, where large sums of money are involved there will always be some pressure from criminals who seek to exploit these resources.

'This database will store a unique DNA profile for each sample submitted. If any are subsequently stolen, these profiles will allow horns recovered to be traced back to their place of origin - helping investigators disentangle the supply chain of this illegal trade.'

The move was welcomed by WWF Scotland director Lang Banks.

He said: 'The illegal trade in rhino horn is now being co-ordinated by sophisticated international criminal syndicates, with big profits to be made by supplying wealthy clients.

'As international efforts are stepped up to protect living rhinos in their natural habitats, we've seen a jump in thefts of horns from private collections in Europe.

'Taking steps to database known rhino horn in Scotland and the rest of the UK will help to close yet another door on those attempting to profit from the illegal trade in endangered wildlife.'
