With its pastoral scenes, tributes to the NHS and Great Ormond Street, dark, satanic mills, references to James Bond, yellow submarines and Mary Poppins, last night's spectacular Opening Ceremony was certainly very British.

With an eclectic soundtrack featuring orchestral through to punk, stopping at Dizzee Rascal on the way, it was at times quite literally Bonkers.

It was almost as if Danny Boyle was putting on a show for the Brits, rather than the rest of the world, so what did the rest of the world make of it?

Well, more than a billion apparently tuned in and the response was pretty mixed.

The Queen's cameo appearance was a 
particular highlight for the non-British audience as she took part in a 
comical segment filmed in Buckingham Palace with Daniel Craig, before 
seemingly parachuting into the Olympic Stadium with the James Bond star.

But some of the more obscure references left many scratching their heads.

Los Angeles Times sports reporter Bill Plaschke tweeted: 'James Bond and Queen Elizabeth II 'parachute' into the stadium, then kids in pyjamas sing the national anthem... works for me.'

Another LA Times reporter, who tweeted shortly after Harry Potter author JK Rowling read from Peter Pan, said: 'The Queen acting, JK Rowling reading in public, can you top this?'

The appearance of Mr Bean also got viewers from the other side of the Atlantic chuckling, with Rowan Atkinson's comical character seeming to go down well with the American press.

Mr Plaschke tweeted: 'Mr Bean hams it up during playing of Chariots of Fire... hilarious.. this is becoming can't-miss ceremony.'

A fellow LA Times reporter wrote: 'Rowan Atkinson segment, very clever.'

The Mail's own Jan Moir called it 'the barmiest Opening Ceremony in Olympic history, an explosion of nonsense and tremendous good fun' - despite it being 'a bit tinky winky and laa-la at times'.Boyle's masterpiece received a five-star rave from the Guardian, which hailed it as 'the biggest, maddest, weirdest, most heartfelt and lovable dream sequence in British cinema history'.The Daily Telegraph saw it as 'breathtakingly politically charged' in comparison to previous opening ceremonies, saying that it was 'about punk rather than pomp'. And although 'utterly compelling', the paper's critic wrote, 'the show periodically lost focus combined sometimes with an almost baffling level of visual detail'.

For the Mirror, it was 'a celebration of our genius, tolerance, humour, and all we have given to the world', adding that 'it was hard to think of any British icon it didn’t reference'.

Another wrote: 'Mr Bean one of the night's scripted surprises.'

The ceremony's showcasing of Britain's rich musical history was another highlight with the use of songs from UK's finest singers and performers seeming to be a massive hit.

KC Johnson from the Chicago Tribune tweeted: 'The Jam has been played. I can go home now. Oh, wait, Arctic Monkeys and Sir Paul still to come. Musical heaven.'

Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times journalist Philip Hersh tweeted: 'Did MTV produce this?'

He also heaped praise on the upbeat nature of the athletes' parade.

'This parade of athletes has much more of a party atmosphere than in past... feels like closing ceremony mood,' he said.

The cinematic element of the ceremony was singled out, with the New York Times describing the show as 'visually stunning'.

But some segments of the showpiece seemed to be lost on particular viewers.

Los Angeles Times sports writer Diane Pucin said: 'For the life of me, though, am still baffled by NHS tribute at opening ceremonies. Like tribute to United Health Care or something in US.'

The fact the Olympic torch was lit by a number of young athletes seemed unpopular with some.

Mr Plaschke tweeted: 'Very symbolic ending, but sort of anticlimatic... I like my cauldron lit by one person... and a person people have heard of.'

John Cherwa from the LA Times wrote: 'Hated the flame lighting. Just make a decision and pick someone.'

The decision to ask former Beatle Paul McCartney to sing out the ceremony was well received.

David Haugh from the Chicago Tribune said: 'McCartney can still bring it... Na, na, na, na, na,na, na, na... show ending appropriately on a high after confusing cauldron lighting.'

Australian journalist Karen Tighe said that Boyle had 'hit the nail on the head' with the opening ceremony.

The Perth-based ABC Sports presenter told BBC Radio 5Live: 'It was a fantastic start to the Games. I'm so glad there was no temptation to be better and bigger than Beijing - it was wonderful in its own way and it all came across so well.'

She added: 'Visually it looked spectacular, there was humour and the overall picture - I think he (Boyle) hit the nail on the head.'

Mrs Tighe said the length of the show was a negative point and also expressed disappointment over the lighting of the cauldron.

Who? The decision to have seven unknown young athletes light the flame was seen by some as a cop-out and an anti-climax

'I really loved the inspiration of a new generation, but it kind of felt a bit of an anti-climax at that point.'

Meanwhile, The New York Times described the 'hilariously quirky' celebration as a 'noisy, busy, witty, dizzying production'.

It added: 'Britain presented itself to the world Friday night as something it has often struggled to express even to itself: a nation secure in its own post-empire identity, whatever that actually is.'

The LA Times also heaped further praise on the occasion.

It said in a review of the ceremony: 'An atmosphere of whimsy and party won out over pomp and circumstance during an Olympic opening ceremony that allowed an economically beleaguered Britain to pat itself on the back.

'The ceremony could not have been more of a contrast from Beijing's four years ago, replacing Chinese militaristic precision with British fancifulness.'

The Times of India called the ceremony 'dazzling', adding that London had 'presented a vibrant picture of Great Britain's rich heritage and culture'.

For the Hindu, another of India's biggest papers, it was a 'cultural tour de force',  while the input of composer AR Rahman, who scored Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, was said to celebrate 'the Indian influences on the UK'.

Meanwhile the China Daily said the pageant was 'kaleidoscopic'.

'Britain's Queen Elizabeth declared the London Olympics open after playing a cameo role in a dizzying ceremony designed to highlight the grandeur and eccentricities of the nation that invented modern sport,' it said.
