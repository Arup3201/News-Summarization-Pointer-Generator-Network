A 46-year-old Philadelphia man charged with putting 
heroin and methadone in his infant son’s bottle, killing him, was convicted Tuesday of third-degree murder.

Orlando
 Rosado was charged with third-degree murder and drug delivery causing 
death in the case. Proscutors claimed he put the drugs in his son's bottle 
to quieten the baby, unintentionally killing him, but the judge said there was no evidence he intentionally administered the drugs.

Orlando Rosado, 46, did not testify at the one-day trial, but the defense said Rosado accidentally put the drugs in the baby’s 3am bottle during a heroin relapse. His son, Christopher, died two days shy of his first birthday in May 2012.

Common Pleas Judge Barbara McDermott said she based her verdict in the nonjury trial partly on Rosado’s conduct afterward, when he gave changing statements to police, including an attempt to blame the death on his five-year-old daughter.'I was appalled when I heard that,' McDermott said.Yet McDermott says she knows Rosado regrets his actions. He told police his son was 'his heart and soul.'The case opened a window into the world of two addicts, mother and father, who sought treatment after their daughter was born addicted to heroin in 2006, and were seemingly doing well. It’s at least the second case in Philadelphia in which a baby died after drinking a heroin-laced bottle.Medical records show Christopher was healthy, if small for his age, and there was no evidence of prior abuse or neglect. Photographs show the house was neatly kept, and the boy’s mother said Rosado handled the overnight feedings, and boiled water to make the formula. And a friend came every day at 7am to take him to a methadone clinic for treatment.

Rosado told police that he fed his son Christopher at 3am on Friday May 11, 
2012 when he awoke fussy, then found the baby unresponsive in a 
vomit-covered bassinet at 7am.

The mother, Crystal Miller, 29, who was also in a daily methadone treatment program, said she 
thought Rosado had been clean since the 2006 birth of their daughter.

But
 a friend who took Rosado to the methadone clinic every day said he
 knew he had relapsed. The friend nonetheless said Rosado was good with 
the baby, and was 'hysterical' on the morning that his son died.

'He was pretty good with the baby,' said the friend, Giovanni Nieves.

Nieves knew that Rosado was still using, buying both heroin and 
methadone on the street. He was also being treated for bipolar disorder.

Deadly: Methadone is a synthetic opiate used in the treatment of heroin addiction

When Nieves arrived the morning of May 11, 2012, Rosado ran outside carrying his limp, discolored boy.

Rosado
 initially told police that he had no idea what happened, and admitted 
only in a third interview, after toxicology tests came back, that he had
 done eight bags of heroin after the boy’s mother went to bed.

'Can you believe he tried to blame it on [their daughter]?' Miller, crying, asked a companion after Tuesday’s verdict.

Defense
 lawyer Bruce Wolf argued that Rosado may have been reckless, but did 
not act with malice, as is required for the third-degree verdict. But 
McDermott questioned the decision to take heroin while caring for the 
infant.

The older child, now six, lives with Rosado’s mother and 
sister, who were in the courtroom to support him but declined to comment
 afterward.

McDermott acquitted Rosado of drug delivery causing 
death, finding there was no evidence he administered the drugs 
intentionally, despite the prosecutor’s theory.

'In his warped 
mind, he thought this would be OK... to make the baby sleep,' Assistant
 District Attorney Lorraine Donnelly argued.

A
 forensic chemist testified that the baby would have ingested the drugs 
within the past eight hours, based on the drugs found in his blood, 
liver and urine. Tests also found evidence of heroin and methadone in 
the remaining liquid in the baby bottle, which was found on a coffee 
table.

Miller testified that Rosado handled nighttime feedings while she slept, and that she did not mix the formula or prepare the bottles in advance. She said she broke off her relationship with Rosado after Christopher's death, in part because she could not get a straight answer from him about what happened that morning.

But she smiled as she spoke of how he insisted on boiling tap water for Christopher's bottles if they were out of bottled water. And she described her son as 'always fussy'.

Defense lawyer Bruce Wolf, perhaps pointing to his defense, asked Miller if people don't get groggy or confused after taking heroin. She agreed that can happen.

Rosado, who has also been treated for bipolar disorder, attempted suicide after the boy's death.
