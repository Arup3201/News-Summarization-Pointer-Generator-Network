Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is set to leave Cardiff City on Thursday after the club’s patience with results reached breaking point.

The Norwegian was called to London for talks with chairman Mehmet Dalman yesterday after Tuesday’s home defeat against Middlesbrough left them 17th in the Championship table. Owner Vincent Tan is not believed to have been at the meeting.

A senior club source told Sportsmail that the former Manchester United striker’s exit has been decided, with only the final details of his departure to be agreed. Confirmation from the club is expected this morning.

Relations between Solskjaer and the club’s hierarchy are said to be ‘amicable’, but dire early-season results forced Tan to act.

Former Scotland midfielder Paul Hartley, 37, who took over at Dundee in January and led them to the Scottish Championship title, emerged on Wednesday night as the leading candidate to replace Solskjaer, though Tony Pulis, MK Dons manager Karl Robinson and Glenn Roeder, who was pictured in the directors’ box on Tuesday, are also in the frame.

A compensation settlement will need to be agreed for Solskjaer, with the 41-year-old said to have been appointed on a staggering £4million a year when he was lured to Wales from Molde in January. The terms of his ‘rolling contract’ are understood to have been reduced after the club were relegated last season.

Despite the club’s relegation as the Premier League’s bottom club — Cardiff were 17th when his predecessor Malky Mackay was sacked — Tan was determined to stick with Solskjaer, though it was made clear that promotion in this campaign was the only acceptable target.

Instead, Cardiff have plummeted after a promising start and are winless in four Championship games. On Saturday, they gave up a two-goal lead at home against Norwich and lost 4-2, and the final straw appears to have been the limp 1-0 loss against Middlesbrough at the Cardiff City Stadium.

In all, Cardiff have won only five of their 25 league matches under Solskjaer. The poor results come in spite of vast investment in the squad, with Tan having spent roughly £16m on 17 new players since Solskjaer took over and permitting Dalman to sign off on one of the division’s biggest wage bills.

But Solskjaer has consistently given off the impression that he does not know his best line-up, having kept an unchanged side only once in league fixtures. More than that, his promise of attacking football, which was so alluring to Tan, has not materialised, with only eight goals scored in the league this season.

Of further concern to the club, the 19,711 gate for the Middlesbrough match was their lowest for a league fixture in four years.
