A jury in Washington state convicted this afternoon a 21-year-old man of murdering a 16-year-old developmentally disabled girl in 2010.

Tyler Savage was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Kimberly Daily, a Special Olympian who had the mental capacity of an 11-year-old.

Savage's  defense team has claimed that Daily's death was the result of a tragic accident during consensual sex.

But Pierce County prosecutors were able to convince the jury that the defendant strangled the teen to death in August 2010 to cover up her rape.

When he is sentenced January 17, the 21-year-old convicted killer will face life in prison without parole.

The members of the jury panel delivered the guilty verdict after less than 24 hours of deliberation, The News Tribune reported. Upon learning his fate, a clean-cut Tyler Savage remained impassive.

During the trial, the defendant testified that on August 17, 2010, Daily met with him near her home and had intercourse with him willingly, and that her death resulted from a sex game gone awry involving strangulation suggested by the girl. 

Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist insisted in his closing arguments Monday that Savage premeditated the girl's death.

‘This was a rape. This was a murder. That's what we pointed out to the jury. That's what the jury found,’ Lindquist said after the verdict was delivered.

Kimberly's father, Cecil Daily, embraced relatives and friends who were in the courtroom Tuesday upon hearing the guilty verdict.

Confession: Savage, then 18 years old, told detectives that her led Daily to an isolated area and choked her when she attempted to leave because he thought it was 'lame'

Daily died August 17, 2010. Savage, then 18 years old, was the last person to see her alive, but he initially denied knowing what happened to her.

Tyler eventually led police to her body dumped in blackberry bushes 12 blocks away from the girl’s home and confessed to killing her.

In a taped interview, Savage told detectives he and Daily had arranged to meet on Facebook, but as they were sitting and talking, the girl decided to leave.

Thinking it was ‘lame,’ the 18-year-old told police that he choked Daily, and then tied a bra and T-shirt around her neck, KIRO-TV reported.

‘She died and I threw her in the sticker bushes kind of afraid of what I did,’ Savage said in the interview.

Afterwards, the teen went to a neighbor’s house to play Dungeons & Dragons online in order to ‘forget’ what happened, according to court documents cited by KOMO News at the time.

However, Savage changed his story at the start of his trial, claiming that the death was an accident in an unsuccessful bid to get the charge against him downgraded from first-degree murder to second-degree manslaughter.

Earlier this year, Washington Governor Jay Inslee signed Kimmie's Law, named after the late Miss Daily, which requires police to enter vulnerable people suffering from developmental disabilities into a state database within six hours of being missing.
