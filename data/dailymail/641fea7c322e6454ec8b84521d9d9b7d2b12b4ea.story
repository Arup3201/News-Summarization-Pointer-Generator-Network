Amber Renea Williamson, 32, faces two counts of sexual misconduct with a minor

A 32-year-old Indiana woman was arrested last week for having sex with a 15-year-old boy after they were allegedly caught in bed together.

Amber Renea Williamson faces two counts of sexual misconduct with a minor after a six week investigation that led Indiana State Police to her.

Despite being told she was under investigation, Williamson remained in contact with her teen lover by sending him messages on Facebook.

A cell phone belonging to Williamson 
contained text messages she had sent the teenager, including one which 
read: 'I want you and only you in my life and heart.'

Police
 in Columbus, Indiana, said the boyfriend of the teen's mother peered 
through a garage window and saw the youngster in bed with Williamson.

The teen has told police he had sex with Williamson and her home and in a garage attached to his home.

The
 investigation began in September after police received a tip off about 
the inappropriate relationship, she was arrested last Tuesday but 
released on a $10,000 bond.

An investigation into the woman's relationship with the teen started in mid-September.

Sheriff's officials said the teen's cell phone contained text messages to Williamson, and she sent a love letter to the boy saying, 'I want you and only you in my life and heart.'

The boy told sheriff's deputies that he and the woman had had sexual relations several times since July, according to an affidavit.

Williamson was not at home when police came to arrest here, but she was later found walking near her apartment.

She faces two counts of sexual misconduct with a minor, both Class B felonies, and one Class A misdemeanor count of invasion of privacy.

A Class B felony carries a sentence of six to 20 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine and a Class A misdemeanor can carry a maximum one-year prison sentence and a maximum $5,000 fine.

Williamson was booked into custody at the Brown County Jail and released on $10,000 bond.
