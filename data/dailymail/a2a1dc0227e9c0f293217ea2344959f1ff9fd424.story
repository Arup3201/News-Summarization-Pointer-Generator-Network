A Florida mother and her live-in boyfriend are facing a slew of child abuse charges after sheriff's officials say the man repeatedly molested his girlfriend’s children - and she did nothing to stop him.

According to the Manatee County's Sheriff's Office, 42-year-old Shawn Ussery had not only sexually abused the minors for five years, but he also smoked methamphetamine with at least one of the victims.

Ussery was arrested Tuesday at his home in Bradenton on 10 counts of sexual battery, 16 counts of capital sexual battery and a single count of aggravated child abuse.

Shocking claims: Shawn Ussery (left) and his 37-year-old girlfriend (right) are facing a slew of charges in connection to sexual abuse involving the woman's children

His 37-year-old girlfriend, who is not being named by MailOnline to protect the identities of her children, is facing charges of child abuse, failure to protect the children, and lewd and lascivious exhibition.

The couples' arrest reports cited by Sarasota Herald Tribune indicate that Shawn Ussery was taken into custody after law enforcement officials received a tip that the 42-year-old man had been abusing his girlfriend's children.

When interviewed by officers, the kids confirmed that information and revealed that their mother has been aware of the molestation and did nothing to protect them from her boyfriend’s advances. 

The children claimed that instead of turning her boyfriend in to the authorities, the 37-year-old mother grew jealous and forced one of her children to watch as she performed oral sex on Ussery.

MyFox Tampa Bay reported that the woman then allegedly declared in reference to Ussery: 'He was mine first.'

Besides the alleged sexual abuse, the children living in the household also have been exposed to drug use, with at least one of the kids allegedly smoking meth with Ussery as recently as three days before his arrest.

The arrest reports state that a blood test later confirmed the presence of methamphetamine in the child's system.

Online jail records show that Ussery has a lengthy criminal record encompassing more than a half dozen arrests on DUI, cocaine, theft and burglary charges dating back to at least the late 1990s.

The couple are being held without bond at Manatee County Jail.
