Chamonix might have Mont Blanc and St Moritz its historic Cresta Run. But the coolest cold spot this week — making front-page news and dominating the chat on snowy websites and glacial blogspots — has been a hitherto unknown resort where I happen to be skiing right now.

To the ranks of Verbier, Val d’Isère, Vail and all those other celebrity perches on the world’s more fashionable mountains can now be added another name: Mam Tor in, er, Derbyshire.

It has a certain rugged simplicity — the nearest thing to après-ski is a pint in the local village of Edale (and the nearest nightclub is in downtown Macclesfield) — but it is as beautiful as any Alp. 

Peak performance: Robert Hardman tackles Mam Tor, Derbyshire - just half an hour's drive from Manchester 

There are no queues for the ski lifts and it’s all extremely peaceful; no piped music, shrieking Sloanes or bossy instructors shouting ‘bend ze knees’. Apart from the odd walker there isn’t a soul around.

Most remarkable of all, however, is the prospect of serious downhill skiing just half an hour’s drive from Manchester.

There is nothing unusual about snow in northern England at this time of year, of course. But the current cold snap has delivered an exceptionally generous dump of snow on Mam Tor, a craggy old Bronze Age hill fort in the heart of the Peak District.

At 1,700 ft above sea level, it is little more than a mound by Scottish standards and a mere pimple in the Alpine scheme of things. But it is famous for its panoramic views and for the unstable shale which frequently comes cascading down a fearsome gully on its southern side, so much so that the road which used to run beneath it eventually had to be abandoned.

This week, an intrepid band of local mountaineers noticed that the gully was covered in more snow than anyone could remember. So they decided to ski it. The dramatic photograph of John Roberts, 30, bombing down the sort of ‘black’ run that would do credit to the Matterhorn — while photographer Alex Messenger climbed up the gully with ice axes — was the shot of a lifetime. ‘I’ll never take another picture like that again. Not in the Peak District, that’s for sure,’ admits Alex, a communications manager with the British Mountaineering Council.

Suddenly, seasoned skiers and thrill-seekers were asking: where is this Mam Tor place? And when can I give it a go? What passes for a crowd is expected this weekend.

So, with another sunny day and sub-zero temperatures in prospect, I have come to ski the Eiger of Edale with John as my guide. And I soon find a few challenges that wouldn’t trouble the average skier in, say, Davos.

In the absence of a chairlift, it’s a half-hour trek up the hill from the National Trust car park. And parts of the path are sheet ice. That’s tricky enough if you are an experienced hill walker. If you are also carrying skis, boots and poles — and they don’t do Sherpas in Derbyshire — it’s rather harder.

Finally, we get to the top and John takes me over to the gully. It’s not so much a slope as a stomach-dropping void. There is a near-vertical plunge down a thin strip of snow between the rocks towards the old road below. An overnight avalanche has exposed a lot of fresh boulders in the gully and any attempt to replicate this week’s famous photograph in these conditions would be suicidal.

Wigan-born John is no madman. A science graduate whose plans for a career in the Royal Marines were scuppered by a climbing injury, he went into teaching, became an assistant head at the age of 24 and has now set up a legal support service for the teaching profession.

He has climbed and skied all over the Alps and scaled the highest peak in Iran. He even built a climbing wall at his Manchester home and says the Peak District has some of the best climbing anywhere. But before now he has never made the same claim about its skiing. ‘Most of my friends have a pair of what we call “Peak skis” — old ones that you don’t mind bashing a bit,’ he says. ‘Every other winter, you might get enough snow for a bit of fun up here. But I can’t remember anything as good as this.’

Daring: John Roberts' dramatic descent, pictured, made headlines after it was photographed this week

We set off down a less treacherous slope in the direction of Castleton. It might not be up to Ski Sunday standards but it’s a lot better than the conditions I found in several resorts while driving through the French Alps shortly before Christmas. Then, the pistes in places like Morzine and chi-chi Megève — at more than twice the altitude of Mam Tor — were little more than grass and mud (they have enjoyed plenty of snow since then). They would have been thrilled to have snow like this at the start of their season.

Whizzing down another aspect of Mam Tor, past a rather startled rambler enjoying a contemplative sarnie, I come across another obstacle that does not trouble the average punter in Klosters or Courchevel — a stile. But then this landscape is, arguably, prettier than any of those famous ski destinations. That is because every ski resort is covered in pylons, stations and cables. Mam Tor has nothing more intrusive than a dry stone wall.

I daresay Méribel, St Anton and even the dear old Cairngorms can probably sleep easy, safe in the knowledge that this latest addition to the ski map of Europe is not going to last.

But for one more day or two, at least, let us raise a glass of Glühwein to the Manchester Matterhorn.
