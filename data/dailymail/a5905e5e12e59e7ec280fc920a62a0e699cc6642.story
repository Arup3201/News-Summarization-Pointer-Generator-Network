Twenty years of bungled dentistry have left a man with crowns held in place by superglue, rotting teeth and a lifelong fear of having his mouth touched by medics.

Botched: Jonathan Anderson was left with a mouth of infected teeth and shoddy implants

So bad was the damage, a dentist who examined marketing manager Jonathan Anderson's mouth described it as looking as if 'a bomb had gone off.'

Mr Anderson, 38, from Dorset, first had surgery at the age of 18 to remove his wisdom teeth but was left with infected gums after a dentist snapped his teeth off at the root instead of extracting them.

Five years later, his front teeth were knocked out after a windsurfing accident but surgeons botched the repairs leaving him with 'tombstone-like' front teeth in a different shade from his remaining molars.

Mr Anderson, a marketing manager, chose to have his operations done privately in an attempt to ensure a perfect result but was left horrified by the damage.

'When you go to someone who's a professional dentist, private, and they're charging an awful lot of money for it, you don't doubt them,' he confessed.

'I looked in the mirror [after the operation], expecting you 
wouldn't be able to tell it was implanted teeth, and I was like: "you 
got the colour completely wrong!"'

But Mr Anderson's problems didn't end 
there. Thanks to the infection caused by the botched wisdom tooth 
operation, more teeth were rotting and dentists told him that the only 
way to repair the damage was by giving him crowns.

Miserable: Despite paying £8,000, he was given crowns so shoddy he had to use glue to keep them in

Infection: An operation to remove wisdom teeth left him with infected molars and gums

Once again the procedure was bungled and his crowns fell out less than 24 hours after they were inserted.

Shockingly, when he complained to the dentist, Mr Anderson was told to stick them back in himself using superglue.

Thanks to years of shoddy treatments, the marketing manager was left low on confidence and embarrassed by his gappy smile.

Even his wedding day in 2012 was marred by his lack of teeth with Mr Anderson forced to keep his mouth closed all day in case one of the crowns fell out.

Fearful: Thanks to his experiences, Mr Anderson has been left terrified of visiting the dentist

Improved: Mr Anderson has since had all of his teeth removed and replaced with correctly fitted implants

'I had the tooth super-glued in for the wedding but it meant I could only manage a close-mouthed smile,' he reveals.

Wife Leanne adds: 'When I first met him, he had a bright, 
beaming smile, but now, even when he is happy, he doesn't show it.

'In 
his mind, he feels he's grotesque, and I'd like him to be back how he was
 when he first met him.'

But restoring his old smile means facing up to the prospect of 12 hours in the dentists' chair - not something Mr Anderson is entirely comfortable with.

During an appearance on Channel 5 documentary, Botched Up Bodies, he said: 'It's a scary thought having more dental
 work done but it's a worse thought to have teeth like this and suppressing my smile for the rest of my life.'

Since then, Mr Anderson has faced his fears and had all of his teeth removed and replaced with correctly fitted implants, but says he remains angry that despite spending £8,000 on dentistry, he was left disfigured.

He is, however, relieved and happy to finally have his smile back. 'The confidence is back,' he reveals.

'Leanne loves how much I can now smile at her. It's awesome, absolutely awesome!'
