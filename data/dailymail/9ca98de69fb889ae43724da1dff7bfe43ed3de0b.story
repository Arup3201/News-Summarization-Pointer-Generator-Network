Lying at the side of the road in a busy marketplace in Sierra Leone the body of an Ebola victim is left abandoned.

The corpse was covered with leaves as dozens of people looked on, unsure what to do in the wake of a strike by burial teams in the capital, Freetown.

Bodies were left in homes and on the streets after a row over a week-long backlog in hazard pay.

Health workers take samples from the body of an Ebola victim lies at the side of a busy marketplace in Freetown, Sierra Leone, after a strike by burial teams over hazard pay left corpses abandoned across the city

Anxious members of the public line the streets looking on, unsure what to in the wake of the strike by 600 volunteer burial workers, paid 100 U.S. dollars a week in hazard pay

Returning back to work once the dispute had been 'resolved' volunteers move in to pick up the body, covering it with a sheet as they spray disinfectant on the steps

The teams are supposed to be paid up to 100 U.S. dollars each week to remove the bodies of Ebola victims.

But after a row over non-payment of the money, the workers went on strike - and the bodies began to pile up by the side of the roads. At the point of death, the virus is at its most virulent.

It means the corpses pose a considerable risk in an already volatile environment where the virus is surging through communities, claiming hundreds of lives each day.

The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation reported bodies of those who had died from the virus were being left in homes and on the streets of Freetown.

Officials today said the dispute had been 'resolved', paving the way for teams to return to work and clear the backlog of bodies amassing as a result of the strike.

Ebola's economic toll could reach more than £20billion by the end of 2014 if the disease ravaging Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone spreads across West Africa.

The outbreak has the potential ‘to inflict massive economic costs’ on those three countries and its closest neighbours, the World Bank said today. Its report estimated the costs of two scenarios:

Jim Yong Kim, the bank's president, said: ‘The international community must find ways to get past logistical roadblocks and bring in more doctors and trained medical staff, more hospital beds and more health and development support to help stop Ebola in its tracks.’

‘Prudent’ investment in better health systems could have lessened the economic fallout, he added.

Concerns about the disease are causing neighbouring countries to close their borders, and airlines and businesses to suspend commercial activities in the three worst-affected countries.

Deputy health minister Madina Rahman told a radio programme this morning the dispute centered on a one-week backlog for hazard pay, which had been deposited in the bank, but was not given to the workers on time. 

'The health ministry is going to investigate the delay in the health workers not receiving their money,' she said.

The burial teams make up a total of 600 workers organized in groups of 12, health ministry spokesman Sidie Yahya Tunis said.

Tunis described the situation as 'very embarrassing'.

The government was already facing criticism this week over a shipping container filled with medical gear and mattresses that has been held up at the port for more than a month.

The World Health Organization says Ebola is believed to have killed more than 600 people in Sierra Leone, where there have been more than 2,100 confirmed cases

More than 3,400 people have been killed by the outbreak in West Africa, which has hit Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia hardest.

In Spain, officials said a nurse and a nursing assistant have been placed under observation for Ebola in a Madrid hospital where a colleague became infected after working with two Spanish missionary priests who contracted the disease in West Africa and later died at the centre. 

It was not known whether the two also treated the two priests or the infected colleague.

The infected nursing assistant is the first person known to catch the disease outside the outbreak zone in West Africa during the current epidemic. She is said to be in stable condition.

Volunteers in Waterloo, Sierra Leone are forced to bury the dead after burial teams reportedly took strike action. The country's deputy health minister said today the dispute has been resolved

Meanwhile in Liberia, efforts have been stepped up to ensure the bodies of victims are buried as soon as possible to try and halt the spread of the virus

The dead bodies of Ebola victims are highly contagious, and if not disposed of promptly can further spread of the  virus, which has so far killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa

The woman's husband is also under observation in the Carlos III hospital while two others, a nurse and a Spanish engineer who had traveled to Nigeria, were given the all -clear after testing negative for the virus.

Spanish authorities are investigating how the nursing assistant became infected. 

They are also monitoring some 50 people who came into contact with her or also tended the two priests that died.

Health authorities in Madrid have faced accusations of not following protocol and poorly preparing health care workers for dealing with Ebola.
