The Transport for London figures were revealed by Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Mark Simmonds in a written ministerial statement.

 the UK in 2013 totalling £541,599.

In a separate written statement, Mr 
Simmonds said: ‘The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has held 
face-to-face meetings with a number of missions about outstanding 
parking fine debt.

‘In addition, in April this year we 
wrote to diplomatic missions and international organisations concerned 
giving them the opportunity to either pay their outstanding fines or 
appeal against them if they considered that the fines had been issued 
incorrectly.

‘Subsequent payments (including amounts 
waived by councils) totalled £197,423. There remains a total of £344,176
 in unpaid fines for 2013.’

A breakdown of embassies with outstanding parking fines totalling £1,000 or more as of June 27, 2014 showed the High Commission for the Federal Republic of Nigeria notched up £74,557 in unpaid parking fines, followed by the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia with a bill of £30,690.

The High Commission for the Republic of Zambia was in third place with a bill of £22,700, followed by the Embassy of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire with a bill of £14,115 and the Embassy of the Republic of Uzbekistan with a bill of £13,375.

The total amount of outstanding National Non-Domestic Rates (NNDR) owed by foreign diplomatic missions increased by 7 per cent on the previous year, a separate FCO written statement showed.

Mr Simmonds said: ‘As at June 30 2014, the total amount of outstanding NNDR payments owed by foreign diplomatic missions as advised by the Valuation Office Agency is £726,076, an increase of 7 per cent over the 2012 figure, as reported in my 2013 WMS (£674,110).

Mutli-million pound problem: Foreign embassies have notched up more than £75million in unpaid London congestion charge debt over the last decade

‘However, £72,137 of this outstanding debt is owed by Iran - which is in the process of reopening its embassy in the UK - and Syria, which is not currently represented in the UK.

‘We have therefore been unable to pursue these debts. Three missions are responsible for just over half of the remainder. We shall continue to urge those with NNDR debt to pay their dues.’

He added that diplomatic missions were obliged to pay only 6 per cent of the total NNDR value of their offices, representing payment for specific services such as street cleaning and street lighting.

A breakdown of diplomatic missions with 
an outstanding NNDR bill over £10,000 in 2013 showed the Embassy of the 
People's Republic of China owed £146,564.

They were followed by the Embassy of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire on £96,258, the High Commission for the People's Republic of Bangladesh on £92,499, the Sierra Leone High Commission on £57,477 and the Embassy of the Republic of Lithuania on £38,703.

MailOnline exclusively revealed in February how France was the worst offending nation for unpaid parking tickets in Central London - owing more than £1million in fines.

Westminster City Council figures showed that on £1,027,000, France owed more than the next seven countries put together - with second-placed Belgium on £273,000, and Spain on £131,000 in third.

Other offenders in the top ten were Germany, Romania, Netherlands, Ireland, Bulgaria, Italy and the United Arab Emirates. A total of £2.7million in parking fines was said to be owed by foreign drivers.
