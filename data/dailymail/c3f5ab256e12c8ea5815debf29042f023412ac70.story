Murdered: Pensioner Jean Dobson, 86, who was battered to death

A former EastEnders actress told a friend she had made three crucial mistakes after battering an elderly widow to death, a court heard.

Karen Williamson, 45, described the killing of Jean Jobson to neighbour Donna Coleman and admitted she had made a string of errors, jurors were told.

Williamson is alleged to have used a hammer and a glass jug to cave in her 86-year-old victim's skull before fleeing with cash, jewellery and bank cards.

The mother-of-one, who featured in a host of TV shows including The Bill and EastEnders as an extra, made her confession around ten days after the killing, the Old Bailey heard.

Giving evidence, Ms Coleman said Williamson had made the shock revelation as they chatted in her bedroom, following the accused killer's first interview with police.

She told jurors: 'She said, "Donna, I made three mistakes."

'The first one is she couldn't find the hat she was wearing. The next one is she couldn't remember if she was wearing her gloves when she got into her car.

'She wasn't sure if she had got blood on her gearstick.'

Asked by prosecutor Brian Altman QC what the third mistake had been, Ms Coleman replied: 'She never actually said.'

Williamson had been carrying out gardening work for Mrs Jobson at her home in Oakridge Road, Downham, south London, at the time of the killing, the court has heard.

Earlier, Ms Campbell said Williamson had told her about a row with the elderly lady over Â£20 she had loaned her for a strimmer.

Recalling what Williamson had told her, Ms Campbell said: 'She (Mrs Jobson) grabbed hold of Karen.

'She grabbed her hat. She was holding on to her, shouting.

'While they were tussling about the old lady shouted: "Karen, have you gone mad?"

'She was holding her, she wouldn't let go and she was quite strong. She was spitting in her face.'

Williamson later said to have admitted: 'She was a strong cow, I couldn't get her off me.'

Ms Campbell said she had also been told: 'If I'm honest, Donna, she was getting the better of me.'

'She grabbed a hammer in her tool bag and then she started hitting the old lady with it because she couldn't get her off her,' she added.

'She told me she was hitting her in her head. She said she just lost it.

'She said, "Donna, I was hitting her so hard with the hammer, the hammer broke".'

Williamson finished off her confession by claiming she had tried to start a fire by draping some laundry over a gas fire, the court heard.

Ms Campbell said Williamson had also told her she disposed of the hammer in a patch of woodland and burned her clothes in her back garden after returning home.

Mrs Jobson, also known as Pat, had no children and had lived alone since her husband died 10 years ago.

She had worked as a bus conductress and a secretary for London County Council and had served as an officer in the Territorial Army.

Williamson, of Rangefield Road, Downham, who had been working as a delivery driver for home shopping firm Ocado, denies murder.

The trial continues.
