A huge forest fire raging in a Chilean city has claimed eleven lives and destroyed 1,000 buildings.

Eleven deaths have already been confirmed as the catastrophic fire continues to engulf the port city of Valparaiso.

The armed forces have been called in to maintain law and order in the city while thousands of people were evacuated amid warnings that the death toll will rise further.

Devastation: The city of Valparaiso in Chile was engulfed by flame yesterday night

Blaze: Some 1,000 homes are now thought to have been destroyed by the fierce flames

Struggle: Firemen attempt to extinguish part of the extensive flames, which have now claimed four lives

Catastrophe: The army has been drafted in to manage evacuations across the city

Huge numbers of homes - many in the steep hills around the city itself - as well as a women's prison were emptied of their residents in a bid to save them from the destruction.

Firefighters were having difficulty 
combating the blaze because of the topography of the city, which is 
surrounded by dozens of steep hills where most people live.

President
 Michelle Bachelet has declared the city a catastrophe zone, which allows the army to step in and take charge of the evacuations.

Ricardo Bravo, the area's regional governor, called the blaze 'the worst disaster I have seen.'

He said: 'Now we fear that the fire will spread to the centre of the city, 
which would increase the severity of the emergency.'

Two of the dead are thought to be elderly people found by volunteer firefighters. No further details about them or the other victims were given.

However, there was hope that the 
disaster could be approaching a turning point, as a spokesman for the 
Chilean government said the blaze was 'a little more under control than Saturday night'.

Thick
 clouds of smoke surrounded the city's prison and nine pregnant inmates 
were transferred to a detention facility in the nearby city of Quillota.
 Prison authorities were evacuating another 204 female inmates to a 
sports arena.

The remaining 2,700 male inmates will stay at the prison for the time being, prison guard commander Tulio Arce said.

Scale: The fire started yesterday afternoon and has already led to 5,000 evacuations

Valparaiso
 Mayor Jorge Castro said shelters for those forced to flee have been set up. He also warned that the 
city was experiencing cuts to the electricity supply.

While
 firefighters, police and forest rangers battled the blaze, Chilean 
marines in combat gear patrolled streets in the city to maintain order 
and prevent looting.

The
 fire started yesterday in hills on the edge of the city and spread 
rapidly because of strong winds. Hot ash rained down on the city early 
today, causing respiratory problems among the population, especially 
children and the elderly.

Valparaiso is about 75 miles north west of the capital, Santiago.
