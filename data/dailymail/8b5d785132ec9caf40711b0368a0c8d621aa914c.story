The show, which starts on August 19, follows Kevin Corcoran, an Irish-American former boxer turned cop, who returns from the Civil War to find his wife missing and his daughter dead. 

Appointed as a New York City police detective, he finds the city full of corruption, class conflict, racial tension and violence.

As he patrols the streets of New York’s notorious Five Points neighborhood, he seeks the truth about what happened to his family with the help of two wartime friends: the wayward son of a wealthy industrialist, and a talented African-American doctor. 

But the three men share a secret from their experience in battle that links their lives forever.

The Mugshot Yourself page allows you to take a picture to be doctored, or upload one from your hard drive or Facebook.

It reads: 'THE FACE OF HISTORY is not in the well-preserved faces of the famous, but in the remains of those who lived in the moment. Join them here, find your place among them.

'Here, the moment is 1864, and here are the faces of their time, captured on film by lawmen and flatfoots. Con men, petty thieves, prostitutes... Oh, and you.

'Meet 1864's greatest rogues, then become one yourself. Try your face on different mugshots, and add the best of them to Copper's growing collection of New York's most notorious.'

Bad boys: Users are encouraged to wink and scowl at the camera to look as much like a true old-fashioned gangster as they can
