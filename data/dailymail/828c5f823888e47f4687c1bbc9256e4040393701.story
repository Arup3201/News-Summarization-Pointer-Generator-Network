The sons of one of Britain’s richest men face jail after they randomly attacked two off-duty policemen after their Christmas party in central London.

George Panayiotou, 26 and his brother Costas, 24, whose father Greek-Cypriot property tycoon Andreas is believed to be worth £400 million, left an off-duty policeman needing titanium plates in his cheek and eye socket after the unprovoked attack.

The two brothers and two friends today pleaded guilty to affray after they attacked the off-duty policemen returning from a night out in Soho.

Costas Panayiotou was also charged with grievous bodily harm but the Crown accepted his plea to the lesser charge.

Prosecutor Michael Hall told Southwark Crown Court how on the night of November 30, five off-duty officers were leaving their Christmas party at the Strawberry Moon club in Soho.

As they walked down Piccadilly, they came across the brothers and Yiannaki Stavrou, 30, and Christopher Stavrou, 28, who were on the other side of the road.

Andreas Panayiotou started boxing at seven, 
showing immediate talent, and left school at 15 (‘with straight As, for 
Absent!’) in order to become a middleweight fighter; Yiannaki Stavrou along with his brother pleaded guilty to affray after attacking two off-duty policemen after their Christmas party

George Panayiotou was play fighting with one of his group before pushing him towards the road.Mr Hall said: ‘One of the officers shouts ‘Oi purple baseball cap’ and the officers then keep on walking.’

Costas Panayiotou then punched a man returning home from a nightclub with his girlfriend before he crossed the road to attack a policeman.

Mr Hall added: ‘Then he punches the off duty officer Gavin Collins, knocking him to the ground and either the punch or his impact with the ground causes an impacted fracture of his cheek and eye socket that requires surgery and the fixing of titanium plates and screws.’

‘Yiannakis Stavros then ran across the road and punched another officer, Matthew Holland, from behind.

‘He is joined by the other two who join in punching Pc Holland as he retreated backwards.

Put up your dukes: Boxer-turned-property magnate, Andreas Panayiotou is one of Britain's richest men with a fortune said to run to £400million. The former champion boxer won 52 of his 53 amateur fights before quitting at the age of 20

Mr Hall said: ‘Matthew Holland is then set upon by all four defendants, punching and kicking him, at one point finding himself on the ground, where they continued to punch and kick him.’

The attack only stopped when door staff from nearby clubs intervened.

The defendants ran down Regent Street towards Glasshouse Street but were arrested in January 2013 after police identified them by their clothing.

Recorder Christopher Hehir said that the four defendants had been very ‘wise’ in pleading guilty but added: ‘The seriousness of the offence means all options, including custody, are open.’

The nightclubber attacked as he walked with his girlfriend as never been traced.

The brothers, who live in Barnet, Hertfordshire, and their accomplices, also of Barnet, were released on bail and are due to be sentenced on May 2.

George Panayiotou appeared on the reality show Desperate Scousewives while he opened a nightclub, PlayGround, near the Albert Docks. 'I love life and grateful for the position I'm in. Health and happiness is all that really matter to me,' he told the producers.

'Liverpool is a place where everyone is regarded the same and no one sticks their nose up at you for what you do or don't have, everyone wants to party.'

George and Costas are the sons of self-made millionaire Andreas Panayiotou.

Born in 1966, to Greek Cypriot 
parents who ran a dry cleaning shop in Mile End, east London, he 
suffered from severe dyslexia as a child.

A former boxer - whose dream of turning pro was nipped in the bud by his parents after they gave him a dry-cleaning shop in 1986.

By the
 early 1990s he had built up a chain of six shops across north London.

In 1992, he was offered a chance to 
buy a flat above one of his shops in Caledonian Road - which he renovated, sold and turned a £20,000 profit.

After
 that, he purchased a property in Islington’s Chapel Street Market, 
built four flats above it, and began renting them to local yuppies.

Mr Panayiotou was soon dubbed 
London’s buy-to-let king, with almost 6,000 rental properties, including
 600-unit apartment blocks in Canary Wharf and the West End in his 
portfolio.

Last year, as he attempted to sell his £65m Grade II-listed, red-brick mansion called Heath Hall, Mr Panayiotou defended his, somewhat extravagant, taste to the Daily Mail.

At the time, the
 Mail’s A.N. Wilson led the charge against what he called the vast 
mansion’s ‘swanky opulence’.

With its white leather sofas, black-lined 
swimming pools, remote-controlled curtains and purple lighting, it was,
 Wilson wrote, as ‘impersonally hideous as a brothel’.

Heath Hall was a derelict shell when Andreas bought it and saw its potential

The decor has been described as vulgar, but Andreas disputes this

Heath Hall is a 14-bedroom mansion in North London and was orignally put on the market in 2011 for a guide price of £100 million

‘These places are not homes, they are exercises in self-promotion and self-advertisement,’ he wrote.

But Mr Panayiotou said he had devoted the past 
five years to renovating Heath Hall, which sits in 2.5 acres of 
landscaped grounds, and includes six reception rooms, a billiard room, a
 cinema, indoor and outdoor pools, and no fewer than 12 bathrooms.

He said allegations of ‘vulgarity’ were simply motivated by envy of the self-made man.

He
 also accused critics of failing to appreciate the ‘top quality’ nature 
of painstaking restoration work on the building, which he paid more than
 120 craftsmen to carry out. 

‘These
 guys are jealous, and, since they haven’t actually been to Heath Hall, 
they’ve got no idea what they’re talking about,’ he argued.
