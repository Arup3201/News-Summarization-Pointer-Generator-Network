Newcastle have agreed a fee with Montpellier for midfielder Remy Cabella - with the Ligue 1's club president confirming 'we have a deal'.

The Magpies made an improved £9million offer for the French midfielder on Wednesday and an agreement has finally been struck, although finer details of the deal are still to be ironed out.

Le 
Parisien carried quotes from Montpellier chief executive officer Laurent
 Nicollin, son of outspoken president Louis Nicollin, where he said that
 'we have a deal' with Newcastle for the transfer of Cabella.

International: Cabella was in Brazil with the French squad but didn't play any part in the tournament

The 24-year-old, who was called into the France World Cup squad for Brazil following Clement Grenier and Franck Ribery's injuries but did not feature in the tournament, has been linked with a move to the North East since the January window.

He has been talked about as a potential replacement for Yohan Cabaye, who left for Paris Saint-Germain earlier in the year, although he is more of an out-and-out wideman.

Newcastle had a bid rejected for the player in January and personal terms must still be agreed, along with the player completing a medical, before he can be confirmed.

If Cabella completes his long-awaited move to Tyneside then he will become manager Alan Pardew's fourth summer signing.

They are also in discussions with Feyenoord over a move for Dutch full-back Daryl Janmaat, with Mathieu Debuchy likely to complete a move to Arsenal imminently.
