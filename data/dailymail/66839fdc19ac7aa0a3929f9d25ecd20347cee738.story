Parliamentarians have been informed that canteen staff cannot open the freezer due to 'circumstances beyond our control'

Bungling MPs have called a locksmith into Parliament – after somebody lost the key to the ice-cream freezer.

Parliamentarians have been informed that canteen staff cannot open the freezer due to 'circumstances beyond our control'.

A note placed on top of the freezer adds that a locksmith has been called and is 'working to rectify the problem'.

Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie spotted the sign on Monday lunchtime.

She tweeted a picture of the note with the caption: 'Spotted at the House of Commons canteen. You couldn't make it up.'

Ms Leslie added: 'I want to know what the 'circumstances beyond our control' is! Rogue anarchist factions in the Freezer dept?!'

The note read: 'Due to circumstances beyond our control we are unable to open the ice-cream freezer. The locksmith has been notified and is working to rectify the problem.

'Should you require ice-cream please ask a member of the Debate staff who will be happy to help. Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience caused.'

The ice-cream freezer is open to all MPs and staff in the House of Commons.

Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie - a trained lifeguard - spotted the sign on Monday lunchtime.She tweeted a picture of the note with the caption: 'Spotted at the House of Commons canteen. You couldn't make it up'

Ms Leslie said: 'We all had a good laugh about it. Who would want ice cream on a cold January?

'And the circumstances as to why there needed to be a locksmith called have to be investigated.

'Maybe we have got anarchy among our ice cream freezers? MPs like to feel important, but I think this is a slight warping of our priorities. As far as I can tell, the freezer was empty anyway.'

The Debate is one of three main eateries inside the Commons.

The House of Commons staff are aware of the incident and are investigating.
