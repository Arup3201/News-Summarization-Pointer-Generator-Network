A family of four was found dead in an Indiana home they’d only just moved into and authorities are blaming carbon monoxide.

Police say a gas generator had been running in the garage of the Merrillville home of Michael Nichols, 41, his wife Kennetha Purnell, 38, their 13-year-old son Matthew and 11-year-old daughter Morgan because electricity hadn’t yet been connected to the home.

They also say that was the cause of the family’s demise after carbon dioxide gas became trapped in the home, where the garage door and all the windows were found closed.

Tragic: A family who'd only just moved into their Merrillville, Indiana home over the weekend is dead after using a gas-powered generator in an unventilated garage as they waited for their electricity to be turned on

Sad: Neighbors say the family minivan was parked in the driveway for days, but they didn't know who to contact about the suspicious lack of activity

Shocking: Kennetha Purnell and her children Matthew and Moran were found dead in their beds. Their father, Michael Nichols, was found slumped in a hallway

Purnell’s mother found the family dead Wednesday evening. A supervisor at Kennetha’s job with Chicago State University had alerted her to her daughter’s absene.

But no one had heard from the family since Saturday, and police believe they could have been dead since the weekend.

That’s when the family moved into the well-kept, two-story rental home in just south of Gary.

Police said the generator was inside an attached garage and had power snaking into the home to the refrigerator, lamps, and a space heater.

The children and their mother were each dead in their beds.

Nichols was slumped in a hallway.

Petruch called the deaths "an unfortunate accident."

The Lake County coroner's office identified the dead but on Thursday evening had not issued a definitive cause of death.

Neighbor Janet Yaros told WBBM-TV that she and others were stunned by the deaths and wished they could have done something to help.

Calamity: Michael Nichols, 41, and Kennetha Purnell had jsut moved into their home when they made the tragic mistake of using a gas-powered generator with no ventilation

Perished: Matthew Nichols, 13, (right) and his sister Morgan, 11, (left) are seen here in undated photos. Though they were found on Wednesday, police believe the family likely died sometime over the weekend

‘We, as the neighbors, had not seen any movement for several days, and the van stayed in the same place all the time,’ she said. ‘And we knew something wasn't right, we just didn't know who to contact.’

Purnell’s father told the Chicago Tribune that things were going well for his daughter and her children.

‘She had them in different programs after school and they were getting educated like her and she was doing good,’ said Kenneth. ‘I just don't know don’t how something like this had to happen. I’m really shocked.’

Grieving: Pictured is Purnell's mother, who found the family dead in their home on Wednesday after not hearing from them for days

Shocked: Pictured is Purnell's, who was at a loss of words when reporters approached him, telling them the he was very confused about how this tragecy could have possibly happened
