Clarke Carlisle will return to radio on Saturday evening for the first time since his horror collision with a Lorry

Carlisle was released from hospital last month, six weeks after sustaining life-threatening injuries

Carlisle was released from hospital last month after sustaining life-threatening injuries in what the former Burnley defender has admitted was a failed suicide attempt.

Carlisle has since told how he made the decision that he 'had to die' after being charged with a drink-driving offence, and later jumped into the path of an oncoming lorry.

In an interview with the Sun last week, the former Professional Footballers' Association chairman revealed that he felt taking his own life would be 'the perfect answer' to a series of problems he was facing.

The news that he was to lose his job as a pundit on ITV, three years after he was released by Burnley, caused Carlisle to go on a gambling spree and hours later he was charged with a drink-driving offence of failing to provide a sample.

He told the Sun: 'I had to die. This wasn't escaping or running away. This was the perfect answer. It made everyone happy and it ticked every box. I took two steps into the road and then jumped into the truck, like a full shoulder charge. I can remember that impact. Bang. Then lights out. I don't know how long had passed. It must have been a few minutes.'

The former Premier League player spent six weeks in hospital after the incident, and was released on Friday. He said his time in hospital made him realise he was 'incredibly unwell'.

'I ventured out of my room not as Clarke the ex-footballer, but as Clarke, a mental health patient," he said. "That was the first step in my road to recovery.'

Since the collision, a host of footballers, former clubs, organisations and charities have used social media to send messages of support to Carlisle and his family.
