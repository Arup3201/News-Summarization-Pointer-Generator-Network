Hundreds of thousands of people in New York and its northern suburbs will still be without power for another 10 days as Consolidated Edison continues to fix the damaged electric grid.

Electricity is expected to be restored to the main island of Manhattan by Saturday, however, since the area is largely run by an underground power network that was easier to fix than the downed electrical lines.

While ConEd is on track to uphold its original plan of returning power to all of Manhattan island on either Friday or Saturday, officials said that the outer boroughs will have to wait until November 10th or 11th for their power.

More than 4.1 million homes and businesses, including about 650,000 ConEd customers, were still without power on Thursday.

Darkness: Around 227,000 homes and businesses are without power in Manhattan, primarily below 36th Street

The delay in reaching the outer 
boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx was attributed
to the difficulties of fixing or replacing the downed overhead lines.

Throughout the week, the company has 
been gradually restoring power to portions of the city, and has reached 
at least 2,000 people in lower Manhattan so far.

While helpful, that is only a sliver of the 227,000 homes and businesses in Manhattan that went dark Monday.

In order to avoid permanent damage 
from rising sea waters, the company preemptively took two underground 
electrical networks out of service and the latest restored power areas 
were a result of those networks being reactivated.

While that reactivation was relatively
easy, the bigger problems came from a massive explosion at one of the 
ConEd power plants in Manhattan's East Village.

The explosion came after the plant was overwhelmed by floodwater.

Much of this area is in pitch darkness, interrupted by the occasional generator-powered light, headlights, and flashlights

Utility company Consolidated Edison, commonly known as ConEd, are on track to uphold their original plan of returning power to all of Manhattan island on either Friday or Saturday

Regardless, the East and West 
Villages, Financial District, Chelsea, Chinatown and the Lower East Side
will be up and running by the weekend, Con Edison said.

The island's wiring system is largely 
underground so workers have been able to asses and repair it faster than
above ground wiring of the outer boroughs.

Outages in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island were not expected to be repaired for another week, the power company said.

For New Yorkers living in the vertical city, a loss of power means much more than spoiled cold cuts and frozen dinners.

Electricity is needed to pump water to
upper floors. Many New Yorkers prepared for the storm by stocking up on
bottled water. But without power, there's no way to flush the toilet.

For others, the outage had graver consequences.

'I have several hundred dollars' worth
of insulin in the refrigerator,' said Joan Moore of New York's Staten 
Island, who is diabetic.

There were encouraging acts of kindness, gestures made by the lucky ones with electricity.

Staten Island, wrote on Facebook.

Sandy blacked out some of the nation's
most densely populated cities and suburbs, instantly taking away modern
conveniences from Virginia to Massachusetts and as far west as the 
Great Lakes.

For power companies, the scale of the 
destruction was unmatched - more widespread than any blizzard or ice 
storm and worse than the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

'It's unprecedented: fallen trees, 
debris, the roads, water, snow. It's a little bit of everything,' said 
Brian Wolff, senior vice president of the Edison Electric Institute, a 
group that lobbies for utilities.

Initially, about 60 million people 
were without power in 8.2 million homes and businesses. By Wednesday 
night, that number had fallen to roughly 44 million people in 6 million 
households and businesses.

Even as power slowly returned to some 
pockets, a new headache emerged: Backup batteries and generators running
cellphone towers were running out of juice. One out of every five 
towers was down, according to the Federal Communications Commission.
