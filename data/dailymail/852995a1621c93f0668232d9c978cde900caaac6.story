The mother of a dying four-year-old girl has spoken of her heartbreaking wish to give her daughter the gift money cannot buy – a cuddle with her unborn baby sister.

Isabella Coomber, from Greenwich in London, dreams of being a big sister but was given less than a year to live in October 2013.

Now her mother, Jolene Hale, 33, is hoping that little Isabella, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour aged two, will live long enough to meet her new sister.

Tragic: Isabella Coomber, four, is dying from a terminal brain tumour diagnosed when she was two

Excited: Isabella is desperate to live long enough to meet her new baby sister, who is due in April

Isabella was having chemotherapy until last October but the treatment was stopped to enable her to enjoy what remained of her life - and what her parents thought would be her last Christmas.

But, much to the surprise of doctors, Isabella outlived the initial prediction of six to 12 months and is likely to celebrate this Christmas as well.

Last year, MailOnline readers were among the well-wishers to rally round and raise funds to make Isabella's dream trip to Disneyland Paris come true.

But this year there are no big presents on her list because all Isabella wants for Christmas is to be a big sister to the new baby, which is due in April.

'I’m sure some people will criticise me for falling pregnant while my daughter is dying but I can honestly say Isabella has never been more excited or happy since I told her there was a new baby coming,' explains Miss Hale.

‘I believe it’s given her something to live for and I pray that they get to meet. The pregnancy has brought us all a lot of joy during this time and I have always tried to keep life as normal as possible for Isabella and her sisters.

Exhausting: Brave Isabella was given just one year to live in October 2013

Too much: Her parents agreed to stop her chemotherapy to make her final months easier to bear

'It's heartbreaking to think they will not grow up together but I just pray they can at least meet.'

Sadly, Isabella's tumour is thought to have grown since treatment was stopped, and her mother is expecting a scan later this month to confirm her grim prognosis. 

'There will never be good news because Isabella is incurable,' adds Miss Hale, 'but all we can hope for is time as a family so Isabella can enjoy being a big sister to the new baby.’

Isabella's illness was diagnosed in November 2011 when she was just two after her mother noticed she was failing to meet milestones like her older sister Rebecca, now eight.

She was already pregnant with her third child, Sophia, now two, when a scan revealed Isabella had a brain tumour and she underwent emergency surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Unfortunately the stress led to the breakdown of her relationship with the girls’ father and they separated in 2012.

Then tragically last year they were told nothing more could be done to save Isabella and the family set about making her wishes come true.

Thanks to an appeal on MailOnline, enough was raised to take the youngster and her sisters to Disneyland.

Biggest wish: Her mother Jolene now hopes the little girl will live until April when her sister is born

And more happiness followed when Miss Hale found love for a second time, this time with a former school friend.

'I asked him if he was totally mad when he told me he wanted to take me out,' she says. 'After all, as a single mother-of-three caring for my terminally ill daughter I’m not exactly a great catch.’

But love blossomed and in February this year, she was shocked to discover that she was pregnant for the fourth time.

'Contraception failed and I questioned how I would cope looking after Isabella and a new baby.’

Weeks later she miscarried. 'It was a lesson to me that any new life is a blessing no matter what the circumstances.’

The couple tried again and in August, Miss Hale discovered that she was pregnant again, breaking the news to a delighted Isabella at 12 weeks.

All three accompanied their mother and her partner for the first scan to ‘meet’ the new baby and were also there for the 20-week scan which revealed that another sister was on the way.

'Isabella was beaming from ear to ear,' says Miss Hale. 'She was delighted to hear she was going to have another sister.

'But the truth is nobody knows if Isabella will be here when the baby is born. All we can do is pray that she will be and until then I want her to be as involved as possible.

'All she talks about is the baby. She is always rubbing my tummy and talking to her sister. The scans have been bittersweet because I don’t know if they are the only time Isabella will ever see her sister on the screen.

'Thanks to the generosity of people we have made all her wishes come true but this one is out of our hands.

‘It feels like a race against the clock but at the same time I don’t want to wish this time away. We are fundraising to make magical memories as we always have been but Isabella’s dream is to hold her baby sister and I pray it comes true.’
