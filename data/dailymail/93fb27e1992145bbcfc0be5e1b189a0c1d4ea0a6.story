Borussia Monchengladbach held Bayern Munich to an exciting 0-0 draw on Sunday as the Bundesliga's top two teams maintained their unbeaten starts to the season, with Bayern unable to carry their blistering Champions League form into the domestic game this week.

Bayern, looking to extend their lead at the top of the table, had goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to thank for keeping the game scoreless and their closest rivals four points at bay after nine games.

Pep Guardiola's side had dominated the first half with David Alaba going closest but Gladbach, who confirmed their credentials as the Bavarians' nearest rival in the Bundesliga this season, responded well in the second half and arguably had the better chances to win it.
