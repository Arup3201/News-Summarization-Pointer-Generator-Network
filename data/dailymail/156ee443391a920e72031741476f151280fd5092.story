Sometimes the best decisions are the ones you didn't mean to make.

For one Californian mom of four, it was a decision that made her $14 million.

Thuan Le from Mission Viejo, bought her weekly set of lottery tickets at her local pharmacy spending $4 on Powerball and $1 on the SuperLotto Plus.

Rollover: The jackpot was a decent $14 million prize

But for one reason or another, she ended up placing $6 into the self-service machine.

When she realized she still had $1 in credit, she told the California Lottery, 'I might as well get another ticket.'

Instead of pressing for a refund she decided to play for a sixth ticket. It was a decision that would pay off.

All of the numbers selected came up in the draw later that night. Ms Le beat the one-in-14 million odds to the win jackpot.

Winner: Mom of four, Thuan Le, bought an extra ticket by accident and her numbers came up!

Screamer: Upon realising the fabulous news Thuan Le ran screaming out of the store with sheer delight. She intends to buy a house and travel with the money

When she returned to the store to check her numbers the following day, she ran out of the store screaming.

Le plans to buy a house, travel and visit her parents in Vietnam.

Le called her sons and one of them came over to take her to claim her prize. 'We thought she was joking,' her son explained, 'but we thought would she really joke like this?'

The winning numbers were 5, 33, 25, 46, 32, and the Mega number 26. It had been almost a month since anyone picked all six numbers to win the SuperLotto Plus jackpot.

Even the CVS Pharmacy where the winning ticket was bought gets something out of it and will receive a bonus of $70,000 for selling the winning ticket.
