Tragic socialite Casey Johnson desperately tried to reconnect with her estranged billionaire father before her sudden death in 2010, but he refused to respond, her mother has revealed.

Sale Johnson said that her ex-husband Woody Johnson, who owns the New York Jets, did not pick up Casey's calls or return her letters after cutting her out following a string of public embarrassments.

Casey, who was heiress to the Johnson & Johnson fortune before her death from complications of diabetes aged 30, also struggled with borderline personality disorder, her mother has revealed.

In the years leading up to her death, it manifested itself in a turbulent lifestyle of heavy partying. In decisions deemed rash by her family, she also adopted a baby and started a lesbian relationship.

Sale Johnson and other relatives and friends spoke to author Jerry Oppenheimer for a new biography, Crazy Rich, that details the scandals of the Johnson & Johnson dynasty and lifts the lid on Casey Johnson's turbulent life and tragic demise.

The book has now been excerpted in the New York Post.

'Borderline personality disorder ruled 
Casey’s life,' Oppenheimer quotes Sale Johnson, who revealed her daughter's mental 
condition for the first time in the book.

'It stole her teenage years and her young 
adulthood life away from her. It’s a mental health disease that 
confounds, scares, hurts the victim, her family, her friends, and her 
doctors.

'They don't want to treat it because it has the highest suicide 
rate, and no cure, and [someone like Casey] is a 24/7 patient.'

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a mental illness characterized by unstable moods, behavior and relationships. Sufferers have problems regulating their emotions and are susceptible to intense anger, impulsive and reckless behavior and often have stormy relationships with loved ones.

Among sufferers, there are high rates of depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, self harm and suicidal thoughts.

While research is continuing into the causes and risk factors, scientists believe that genetic and environmental factors could be involved. Unstable family situations could also increase a person's risk.

Around 1.6 per cent of adults in the U.S. have BPD, and symptoms usually begin to show in early adulthood. It can be treated with psychotherapy or medications that can help reduce anxiety or depression.

It further complicated her diabetes, 
which she had been diagnosed with aged eight, and which ultimately 
claimed her life after she failed to properly take her insulin.

Her
 mother said that at first it was assumed that her disruptiveness at 
home and school as a child was due to the diabetes, when in fact, it was
 likely caused by her borderline personality disorder.

And as she aged, the condition only took further hold, causing unstable moods and relationships.

After
 a charmed upbringing during which she was given anything she dreamed 
of, she began partying, drinking and taking drugs in an attempt to help 
her through her struggles, her mother said.

She lasted just one semester at Brown 
University and after her parents divorced in 2001, she moved to 
Hollywood with dreams of becoming a star.

Her parents moved to Los Angeles several years later to stage an intervention, but she rebuffed them, angering her father.

'After that, Woody basically washed his hands of Casey,' Sale Johnson said.

Then, after a public falling out with Woody's sister Elizabeth Ross Johnson, he cut off all ties with her, including her trust fund of millions of dollars.

As she continued to struggle with her 
health, Casey adopted a Kazakh baby girl, Ava-Monroe, in 2007, even 
though her parents were concerned she could not look after the child.

A year later, her mother said Casey 
was desperate to introduce Ava to her estranged father in an attempt to 
reconnect and visited his home - where she was met by his second wife, 
Suzanna Ircha.

Ircha 
demanded Casey leave and she refused, sparking a loud and heated 
argument - and eventually Ircha called 911. Woody also arrived home and 
demanded his daughter never return.

Despite his hostility, Casey did not give up on a relationship with her father, Sale said.

'Casey
 sent love letters to her father,' she said in the book. 'She called and
 left voice mails, and Woody chose not to respond.'

As Casey spiraled further out of control - being hospitalized for her diabetes, handing her daughter over to her mother and starting a public lesbian relationship with model Tila Tequila - Sale said she became bitter about how her ex-husband had just washed his hands of their troublesome daughter.

'He didn't want to have anything to do with Casey,' she said. 'It was too much trouble. But fathers are supposed to take a bullet for their kids, and he went the other way... I thought it was appalling.'

After she became more distanced from her family towards the end of 2009, she is believed to have spent New Year's Eve alone in Los Angeles.

Home: She died aged 30 after slipping into a diabetic coma after failing to properly regulate her insulin

Her body was discovered on January 4, 2010 - a few days after she is believed to have died after slipping into a diabetic coma.

After his daughter's death, Woody 
Johnson told the New York Times that she had been 'trying to find her 
own identity. She was rebellious. She made some judgment errors. Been 
there, done that. She had to take responsibility. And it couldn't be me 
pushing. Or her mother. Or her doctor. She would ultimately have to do 
it herself.'

Tila Tequila, 
who had become engaged to Johnson just weeks before her death, led the 
tributes on Twitter, saying: 'R.I.P. my Angel, u will forever be in my 
heart! I love u so so much and we will Marry when I see U in Heaven my 
Wifey.'

Sale Johnson continues to have custody of Casey's daughter Ava-Monroe, who is now seven.
