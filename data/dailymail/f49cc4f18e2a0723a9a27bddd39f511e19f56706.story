Prime Minister David Cameron is set to announce a £15billion boost for more than 100 projects, which is expected to be completed by the end of the decade

David Cameron will today embrace what Margaret Thatcher called 'the great car economy' as he unveils plans for the biggest roadbuilding programme for almost half a century.

The Prime Minister will announce a £15billion boost for more than 100 projects to be completed by the end of the decade, resulting in hundreds of miles of extra lanes on Britain's motorways and trunk roads.

Schemes include finally putting the A303 into a tunnel past the notorious Stonehenge bottleneck, and widening the A1 north of Newcastle and trans-Pennine roads in the north of England.

Mr Cameron's announcement echoes the 'roads for prosperity' scheme unveiled by Mrs Thatcher in 1989 to boost 'the great car economy', which promised the largest expansion of the roads network since the Romans. 

But many schemes were quietly abandoned in the mid-1990s after environmental protests and spending cuts.

Addressing the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) annual conference in London today, Mr Cameron will say the Government is to set out the first-ever long term 'roads investment strategy' for the UK in Chancellor George Osborne's forthcoming autumn statement.

The programme will improve the lives of commuters and support business and enterprise across the country, he will claim.

The scheme will be 'the biggest, boldest and most far-reaching road improvement programme in four decades', Mr Cameron will say. 

'This will be nothing less than a roads revolution – one which will lead to quicker journey times, more jobs, and businesses boosted.'

The £15billion investment between 2015-16 and 2020-21 will be the biggest upgrade to our roads in a generation, officials say, and will take total spending on the network over the decade to £24billion.

One of the schemes includes finally putting the A303 into a tunnel past the notorious Stonehenge bottleneck

• The A303 to the south-west

• The A1 north of Newcastle

• The A1 Newcastle-Gateshead western bypass

• Trans-Pennine roads in the north of England,

• The A47 in the east of England

• The A27 on the south coast

Unions claim the move is a precursor to its privatisation of the roads network, which has been valued at £111billion, and more tolls being charged.

Chris Todd, of the Campaign for Better Transport, which promotes improved public transport said the plans 'will trash protected areas and do nothing for the economy'.

He added: 'It makes no sense to spend billions ploughing more lanes of traffic through our National Parks or desecrating irreplaceable historic sites like Stonehenge.' 

'These schemes will make people more dependent than ever on their cars, place greater costs on the NHS, while failing to tackle problems like the massive backlog of pot holes blighting local roads.' 

AA president Edmund King said: 'Roads carry 90 oer cent of goods and people and are our biggest transport asset and so it makes perfect sense to upgrade them to help the UK economy by improving journey times for people and business.

'AA members have told us, in a new AA/Populus that the most important message they want conveyed to the Government is 'we pay too much motoring tax yet so little is spent on the roads'. Perhaps at long last road users are going to see more of their hard paid motoring taxes being reinvested in the road network'.

Shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher said: 'This is another pre-election con trick from David Cameron. This desperate so-called announcement of promised road improvements includes no additional money and people simply won't fall for it.

'When it comes to road investment, the truth is Cameron leaves us like a frustrated motorist trying to get through the rush hour - we're stuck going nowhere fast.

'Cameron should be judged on his record, not on a speech, and his record on road investment has been nothing but a chaotic series of u-turns.

Cutting investment, then promising to restore it after 2015. Cancelling road schemes, like the A14, then reinstating them. And constantly failing to meet deadlines for the completion of improvements.

'Far from taking big decisions on transport, Cameron has dithered for five years on airport expansion and has been so slow to bring forward the HS2 Bill that it won't pass in this Parliament.

'We know Cameron's record on infrastructure is one of all talk and no delivery. Infrastructure output has fallen by nearly 20% since May 2010 and less than a third of projects in the Government's pipeline are actually classed as 'in construction'.

'The Tories should back Labour's plan for an independent infrastructure commission to end the dither and delay on the decisions we need to take for Britain's future.'
