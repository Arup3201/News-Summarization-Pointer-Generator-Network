Jose Matada, from Mozambique, fell to his death from the undercarriage of an aeroplane ten miles from Heathrow

Detectives have identified the man whose body fell onto a suburban London road from the under carriage of a plane flying to Heathrow last year.

José Matada, 30, from Mozambique, was found in Portman Avenue, Mortlake, in September but the Metropolitan Police struggled to identify him. 

Detectives analysed a SIM card found in his jeans and contacted the phone numbers that were stored on it.

They were able to extract and contact telephone numbers from the card as part of the 'complex inquiry'. 

They had originally thought he was Angolan because of currency found in his pockets and the fact that a flight from Luanda, Angola, had passed over shortly before the body was found.

However, he was not a member of air crew or a passenger.

Officers are now working with authorities in Mozambique to try to find his next of kin.

An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said they are 'satisfied' the man is Mr Matada and said they had been able to identify him as 'new information has recently come to light'.

In December, police released images of the man in a bid to identify him.

His body was found shortly in the suburban road, ten miles from the airport, before 8am on September 9.

A post mortem held at Kingston Hospital Mortuary gave the cause of death as multiple injuries.

Aviation experts said at the time that the man was probably 
dead before he hit the ground either because he had been crushed by the 
retracting landing gear shortly after the plane took off, or because of 
the extreme cold at high altitude.

Detectives initially believed Mr Matada was from Angola as he had the country's currency on him when he was found in the street in Mortlake, pictured

One resident said in September: ‘It is unbelievable. The first thing I thought when I saw the body was that it must have fallen from quite a height.'

Mr
Matada was wearing jeans, a grey hoody and white trainers when he fell,
and had a tattoo on his left arm of a distinctive emblem with the 
letters ' Z ' and 'G ' clearly visible.

A Civil Aviation 
Authority spokesman said a stowaway in an aircraft undercarriage was 
unlikely to survive as he would either be crushed by the wheels after 
take-off 
or freeze in temperatures as low as minus 40C (minus 40F).

He said last year: ‘The chances of survival for a stowaway are very slim, particularly in the recess of the landing gear.

‘I don’t know of anyone who has survived being stowed away on a long-haul flight.

‘When the landing gear comes down at 
the other end, a few miles from the runway and about 2,000ft in the air,
if there is a person who had died they would fall out.’

Aviation experts say Mr Matada was probably dead before he hit the ground either from cold or from being crushed by the wheels after take off (file picture)
