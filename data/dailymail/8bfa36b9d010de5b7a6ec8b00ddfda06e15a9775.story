Hearts owner Ann Budge absolved Rangers of blame following what she described as ‘a very frightening experience’ for supporters in the aftermath of last Friday’s abandoned match at Ibrox.

But she branded the lack of segregation of fans leaving the ground and the parking for supporters as ‘clearly inadequate’ as police enquiries into reported scuffles and allegations of missiles being thrown at visitors’ buses continued.

Budge, who has spoken to police as part of her own investigation, insisted there had been no intelligence to suggest there would be crowd disorder.

She said: ‘The SPFL match delegate’s report states unequivocally that the events were in no way caused by poor or ineffective match operation preparation on the part of the home club. Our own safety officer shares that view.

‘While we may not all agree with some of the decisions taken on the night, I am confident those decisions were taken in good faith, by appropriately experienced professionals using their judgement, and taking the big picture into account.

‘Both we, and Rangers’ security staff, will be working closely and co-operatively with the investigation, to assist in any way we can.

‘As well as trying to identify those responsible, we will work very closely with all parties to try to ensure there is no repetition of this behaviour at the re-arranged fixture.’

When the match is replayed, with Saturday April 4 being discussed as a possibility, Budge has promised to personally oversee security arrangements in a bid to ensure it passes off peacefully.

She said: ‘Lots of questions have been asked about what went wrong on Friday night. Extenuating circumstances conspired to turn what should have been a showpiece football match into what was at times, a very frightening experience for many supporters.

‘I have agreed with Police Scotland that we will personally discuss every aspect of the re-arranged fixture in detail, in advance of the pre-operational planning meeting.

‘We will focus closely on segregation issues both inside and outside the stadium, as well as car park security and on ensuring safe ingress and egress from Ibrox.

‘Last Friday was not a good experience for any of us, for many reasons. We must all do our best to ensure no repetition in the future. As ever, I have to ask that all of our fans play their part in stamping out unacceptable behaviour.’
