A rejected lover paid a teenager £850 to burn down the home of the young woman who turned him down.

Failed soldier Aiden Feeney, 24, launched a hate campaign against Scarlett O’Connor when she refused to go out with him after they had a one night stand, a court heard.

He sent the 22-year-old as many as 3,000 text messages over four days, and became aggressive when Miss O’Connor continued to refuse his advances. Feeney spoke of ‘ripping her head off’ and told one friend he had a ‘contact who would burn down her house for £1,000’.

Scarlett O'Connor's sister Lauren was staying in the house (pictured) in Walkden, near Salford, Greater Manchester when the fire broke out forcing her to run from the property

The threats prompted firemen to carry 
out an urgent risk assessment of the home Miss O’Connor shared with her 
elder sister Lauren, install extra smoke alarms and tape up the 
letterbox of the property as a precaution.

The
 attack went ahead, however, after Feeney paid Tyler Bennett, 19, to 
carry out the job. He took a taxi to the house and threw firelighters 
through the front window when he could not open the letterbox. It is 
thought Miss O’Connor was staying at a friend’s home but the fire alarms
 alerted her 29-year-old sister, who managed to escape uninjured.

After
 the curtains caught fire,  the blaze quickly spread through the 
downstairs of the property in Walkden, near Salford, causing up to 
£18,500 of damage.

Feeney 
was jailed for eight and a half years after being convicted of arson 
with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of aggravated 
harassment.

Manchester Crown
 Court was told Feeney, who tried and failed to get in to the Army, 
already has convictions for arson and harassment after targeting a 
previous girlfriend.

Bennett
 was jailed for four years after being convicted of arson with intent to
 endanger life. Passing sentence Judge Martin Rudland told Feeney: ‘All 
these offences arise out of your friendship with Scarlett O’Connor.

‘You
 saw something beyond the platonic which no doubt was encouraged by the 
one night stand. For her this changed nothing and she said as such but 
this infuriated you. The texts show increased frustration culminating in
 threats to her life and well-being.

‘The
 fire spread rapidly and set fire to furniture. Lauren said she was 
terrified. She saw flames, smoke and could see possessions burn. She was
 physically retching. Lauren then saw firelighters in a row on the 
ground under the window.

‘You must both understand use of fire is an extremely serious form of criminality.’

The
 court also heard how Miss O’Connor has moved to Australia following the
 attack last September. Outside court, sister Lauren said: ‘It was 
horrible. It was so scary – to watch my own house go up in flames. It 
was the worst day of my life. You just do not expect anything like that 
to happen to you in your entire life.

‘He
 was going to put it through the letterbox. That would have been a very 
different story if that had happened. That is our only way out.

‘In
 the run up to the attack there was something like 3,000 text messages 
in the space of four days. He was just crazy for Scarlett. My sister is 
in Australia now to get away from it all. It has scared the living 
daylights out of us.’

The attack had arisen out of a bitter dispute over an £80 payment for a ticket given by Feeney, pictured, to Ms O'Connor for the Creamfield festival near Liverpool where The Prodigy were headlining

Manchester Crown Court was told that Scarlett O'Connor, pictured left and right, had since fled to Australia following last September's arson attack
