The policeman shot and blinded by crazed killer Raoul Moat last night announced the end of his 20-year marriage.

Pc David Rathband, 43, used Twitter to confirm he and his estranged wife Kath, 41, are set to divorce.

Clearly heartbroken he wrote: ‘Sad to announce Mrs R has called time on our marriage separation permanent.’

Divorcing: Pc David Rathband is splitting from his wife Kath, 41, he revealed on Twitter yesterday

The couple separated at the end of August after police were called to their £300,000 home in Cramlington, Northumberland, following reports of a domestic incident. 

Pc Rathband was detained by colleagues from Northumbria Police on suspicion of assault after responding to a late-night call made by the couple’s son Ashley, 19. 

Killer: Raoul Moat shot Pc Rathband in the face while he was sat in his patrol car

Pc Rathband, a former traffic officer, was spoken to at the scene and officers gave the couple advice before leaving. 

The couple remained in contact with one another and appeared to be rebuilding their marriage. 

But just two days ago he wrote: ‘Life is a mystery. Who knows what is round the corner. Roll on Christmas.’  

Pc Rathband miraculously survived after he was shot twice by Moat from close range as he sat in his traffic car at a roundabout in the West Denton area of Newcastle. 

He was left with more than 200 pellets lodged in his skull yet gave evidence at the trial of Moat’s two accomplices, Karl Ness and Qhuram Awan. Both were jailed.

Wearing his uniform and holding a white stick, he told a court how he had seen the crazed killer approach his Volvo before two shots were fired through the passenger window.  

He was convinced he was going to die, he told the jury. Somehow he managed to radio for help and was rushed to hospital where he had emergency surgery.

Since then he has launched his own charity, the Blue Lamp Foundation, to help emergency service personnel injured in the line of duty. He has also won bravery awards.

In his autobiography, Tango 190, Pc Rathband paid tribute to his wife and children for supporting him in the months after the shooting in July last year.  

‘I live for them now,’ he wrote.

Moat, who shot and injured his former partner Sam Stobbart and killed her new boyfriend, Chris Brown, vowed to kill as many policemen as he could while on the run.

He was finally cornered by armed officers in the Northumberland village of Rothbury where, after a six hour stand-off, he shot himself in the head with his double-barrelled shotgun.

Following the news of Moat’s death Pc Rathband said he had enjoyed his first full night’s sleep for ages.

He has since launched legal action against Northumbria Police, accusing the force of failing to do enough to protect him and fellow officers from the killer.
