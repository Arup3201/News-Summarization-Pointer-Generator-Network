Francis Coquelin has earned himself a place in Arsene Wenger’s long-term midfield plans thanks to his improved recent displays.

The midfielder’s contract expires at the end of the season, but talks over a new deal are now underway and the Gunners are confident of securing the Frenchman to a long-term deal in the coming weeks.

Wenger will give his midfield a shake-up ahead of next season and Coquelin will be part of a new-look Gunners engine room next season.

At the end of last year Coquelin was on loan at Charlton, with his Arsenal career seemingly over

2008-present: Arsenal (28 apps, 0 goals)

2010–2011: Lorient LOAN (24 apps 1 goal)

2013–2014: Freiburg LOAN (16 apps 0 goals)

2014: Charlton Athletic LOAN (5 apps 0 goals)

The Gunners will make Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin their primary target in the summer, with Wenger identifying the France international as the man he wants to be his lynchpin next season.

Alongside Schneiderlin and Coquelin in Wenger’s midfield options will be Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey and Mikel Arteta.

Abou Diaby is set to leave when his contract expires in the summer, while the fact that Coquelin has now overtaken Mathieu Flamini in the midfield pecking order has placed doubts over his future at the club.

Interceptions: 6

Tackles: 3/3

Aerial duels won: 7/8

Clearances: 11

Passing accuracy: 87 per cent 

Coquelin’s new contract will complete a remarkable turnaround in his status at the club over the past few weeks.

The former France Under-21 international was deemed surplus to requirements at the end of last season, but the Gunners failed to find a permanent buyer for the midfielder.

He was loaned out to Charlton, where he made five appearances, before being recalled to the Emirates Stadium in December.

Coquelin has made five consecutive starts for Arsenal, culminating in his excellent performance in the win at Manchester City on Sunday.
