Pieces of movie memorabilia come up for sale now and again, but it's not often you actually get to live in your purchase.

The house that Rocky Balboa bought in the 1979 film Rocky II is up for sale.

The three bedroom terraced house, which is located in south Philadelphia could be yours for $139,000.

2313 South Lambert Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: The house Rocky Balboa and his wife Adrian moved into after he won the 'comeback of the century' in the 1979 film Rocky II

Winner: Rocky bought the home in the 1979 film Rocky II with his winnings. It can be yours for $139,000

Solid neighbourhood, new bricks: You can see why Rocky liked the place so much. The address is often visited by fans of the movie franchise

The Girard Estate listing alludes to the buildings' place in Rocky movie history stating: 'for all you movie buffs'.

Realtor Joe Biancaniello grew up in the area and was around at the time of filming told the Daily News it was a big deal at the time: 'I was friends with the owners and they let me come over and watch the filming from inside. People came from all over the place, the police had to shut down streets. You know, Sylvester Stallone comes to the neighborhood, it’s pretty cool. It was chaos.'

Biandaniello's listing goes on to mention the 90-year-old house is 'located on a lovely tree lined street within walking distance to Girard Park'.

2313 South Lambert Street, where the home is situated, was also used in several scenes from the film.

Fans of the franchise may recall the 
scene where Rocky and Adrian visit the property to take a look around.

The
house was only used for only exterior shots during filming and tourists
occasionally stop by to have their pictures taken outside.

Character: From the wallpaper and cabinets to the oven and cooker, there is something distinctly 1960's about the place

What if?: It doesn't take too much imagination to think of the discussions Rocky may have had with his wife Adrian and his trainer before contemplating another bout and of course Rocky III

Interior: 3 bedrooms one and a half bathrooms, a basement and some movie magic. None of the inside of the house was used in the film

Basement in training: For a prospective buyer this basement could be a good place for a workshop - or how about a punchbag and treadmill?

The property is on a 'Total Rocky' website that gives people a tour of Rocky-related Philadelphia landmarks.

Rocky's own declaration in the film helps to sell the place in some small way.

In the movie he says the home is 'in a very solid neighborhood with new bricks plus, the numbers on this house, 2313, almost add up to nine' - a sign of good luck.

Rock bottom: At $139,000 it's a rare opportunity to own a piece of movie memorabilia you can live in

Wedding day: Rocky and Adrian moved into their new house after they got married. The outside of the house looks just the same now as it did then

Everything depends on this: It was only after Rocky Balboa defeated Apollo Creed that he was able to buy 2313 S Lambert St. with the winnings - now you can too!

Rocky and Adrian’s first home looks nearly identical to its 1979 appearance in Rocky II, even down to the small details.

The railing along the steps, the paneling on the white front door and porch light, 2313 number plate.

Even the white mailbox that Rocky admires so much looks the same.

The only major difference is the tree that was just a sapling when Rocky and Adrian moved in is now a tall, strong tree.

At 1,306 sq ft, built in 1923, the place has three bedrooms, one and a half bathrooms, a basement and some movie magic.
