As the world's richest man, you might think Bill Gates would part with some loose change to pay someone to do his dishes. But the billionaire won't have any of that.

He likes to do them himself - to his own exacting standards every night.

The 58-year-old Microsoft founder shed light on his domestic habits and other personal insights during an online question-and-answer session on Reddit.com.

Alongside more high-brow topics of philanthropy and government spying, Gates shared the eyebrow-raising revelation that his wife would likely want Samuel L Jackson to play her husband in a biopic.

When asked who he'd want to portray him in a biopic, a reader interjected with Jackson.

Gates responded, 'Melinda would probably watch that version.'

He confided that his most expensive guilty pleasure purchase was his private plane which he uses for travel in connection with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

And he admitted that he would still pick up a $100 bill if he found it on the street.

When asked to reveal a secret about himself which no-one would expect, Gates said: 'Playing Bridge is a pretty old-fashioned thing in a way that I really like.

'I do the dishes every night - other people volunteer but I like the way I do it.'

When asked which actor he would like to play him in a movie, another user answered 'Samuel L Jackson' for him.

To which, Gates retorted: 'Melinda would probably watch that version.'

Of his jet, he said: 'Owning a plane is a guilty pleasure. Warren Buffett called his the Indefensible.

'I do get to a lot of places for Foundation work I wouldn't be able to go to without it.'

Gates also gave his views on philanthropy, government snooping and his return to a hands-on role at Microsoft to assist newly-appointed chief executive Satya Nadella.

'Satya is taking a fresh view of where Microsoft is - strengths and weaknesses,' Gates said .

'A new person gets to step back and change the focus in some ways. He is off to a great start.'

Hands-on: The philanthropist (pictured with his wife Melinda in India in 2011) says he does the dishes every night because he likes the way he does them

Gates noted that he doesn't plan to stay at the office for days at a time as he did in his younger days when he had 'energy and naivete' on his side.

He expected to give about a third of his work time to Microsoft and the remaining two-thirds to the philanthropic foundation he runs with his wife.

He dismissed the notion of being the biggest philanthropist, contending that while he gives a lot of money to charitable causes, aid workers living in difficult conditions sacrifice more than he does.

When asked his thoughts on US spy agencies snooping on computer use, Gates described it as a 'complex' issue that will grow in importance as cameras and sensors in devices collect more information about users.

'We need to have trust in the way information is protected and gathered,' Gates said.

'There is a role for the government to try and stop crime and terrorism but it will have to be more open.'
