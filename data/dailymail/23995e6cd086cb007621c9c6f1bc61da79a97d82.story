Red Bull Cape Fear crowned eight winners at the inaugural event in Sydney on Sunday.

The event brought in local and international 'big wave' surfers to Botany Bay in Sydney south east to what has been called 'the most dangerous wave in the world.'

Competitor and event organiser Mark Matthews said 'It's not a big wave surf event but not based on size but based on danger.'

The waves at Botany Bay were expected to reach over three to four metres but that wasn't the dangerous aspect of the event.

Some of the deadliest rocky reefs lie just under shallow waves making the dangerous event that much more exillirating.

Sixteen of the world's best surfers went head-to-head on the dangerous surf.

The event structure is set out like a boxing match, where competitors battle it out one-on-one in eight competitions.

'It's a boxing style event,' Mr Matthews said, 'surfers battle it out in pairs like a boxing card event.'
