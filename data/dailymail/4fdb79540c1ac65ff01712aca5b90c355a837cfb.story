When it comes to those big nights out, less is definitely not more. You need to turn up the volume (not just on your hair) but on your whole look so you can stand out from the crowd.

Last week I had a big red-carpet event that I was attending with Made In Chelsea colleague Rosie Fortescue, so we both popped down to Duck & Dry, the recently launched Kings Road hair salon that specialise in blow-drys and up-dos.

For big night hair, getting someone else to do your blow-dry really helps to nail your look. Most salons will happily do this for around £15-£20, but if you are working to a budget call a friend and get ready together.

Binky opted for classic Hollywood glamour for her beauty look

I went for cascading volumous curls – bigger the better. My hair was dried gently including the roots by Duck & Dry Creative Director Snowden Hill and he used O&M Rootilicious Root Lift, but I’ve not seen this product on-sale in shops, so my choice for home would be Schwarzkopf Professional Osis + Blow and Go Thick Spray.

Massage this into the roots to give lift and volume, and tease in a good styling mousse for the main body of your hair that adds body – one of my favourites is Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious Holding Foam.

Snowden then blow-dried my hair with a large round brush (remember be careful not to damage your hair with too much heat) and then put it in large Velcro curlers in sections for about 15 minutes.

Binky rocked a £500,000 ring and £50,000 bracelet to ensure she was looking red carpet chic

He then used heated tongs on all sections, and back-combed, starting from the nape of the neck, sides and then into the sides and finally the top sections and then smoothed and styled. I normally use Sexy Hair – Big Sexy Hair Spray and Play, it does what is says on the tine and has super firm hold that lasts all night.

Rosie had curlers on the top section to give lift but then had the side sections blow-dried tight to the sides and back, and back-combed sections at the bottom by the nape of the neck to give lift at the back. 

It was a really sleek look and it requires quite a bit of Schwarzkopf Professional BC Bonacure Oil Miracle Divine Polish Shine Spray which created a glossy finish which had a real cutting-edge catwalk feel.

For my night out I was also lucky enough to have jeweller to the stars Vashi Dominguez – owner of top diamond retailer Vashi.com – lend me some beautiful jewellery for the occasion. 

He adorned me with a pair of sophisticated 15 carat drop chandelier diamond earrings worth £50,000, a dainty 25 carat diamond tennis bracelet worth £80,000 and a massive 60 carat Burmese sapphire diamond ring worth a whopping £500,000!

The stunning Vashi.com jewellery complemented my outfit perfectly and made me feel like a million dollars (quite literally!).

Binky says it's important to opt for a high quality lipstick in order to prevent bleeding and fade

Clearly I can’t afford to keep these jewels and on most occasions I wear some statement costume jewellery to add a bit of bling to the finished look.

Now on to the make-up. If you go big with the hair you really have to follow suit with the make-up.

DiorSkin Forever Flawless Perfection Fusion Wear Make-Up: Flash photography and the harsh lighting at big events can show up even the tiniest imperfections, so a flawless-looking complexion is essential. This fluid foundation melts into the skin to create a perfect complexion that should easily last for the whole evening.

Guerlain Maxi Lash Volume Creating Curl Sculpting Mascara:

The secret to really luscious lashes is fresh mascara. As soon as it starts to dry out, it will become less effective, so I always invest in a brand new wand before a special night, and this is my current favourite. 

Volumising, curling and lengthening your lashes, all in a single sweep of the brush, it gives you deliciously dark and smoky eyes without smudging, flaking or fading during the evening.

Clarins Rouge Prodige True-Hold Colour & Shine Lipstick:

For those of you who thought one lipstick is the same as another – well, think again. Poor quality lip products can fade, slide or bleed mere minutes after you’ve applied them. This Clarins lip colour, however, really lasts, without drying out your pout like some long-hold lipsticks can. 

The formula boasts botanical waxes to nourish, pearl polymers to give intense colour and hold, and plant oils for shine and moisture. I chose a soft raspberry shade called Tea Rose, and it kept my lips looking kissable right through to the final “mwah”!

Narciso Rodriguez Narciso Eau de Parfum Spray:

For me, the final piece of the beauty puzzle is always a spritz of delicious perfume. This new fragrance from fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez is strikingly sexy – just the thing to boost your confidence and make you feel irresistible as you arrive at a big event. 

Featuring notes of vetiver, Bulgarian rose, musk and amber, it is inspired by women’s powers of seduction! It certainly made me feel desirable, though with Rosie at my side how could the boys resist. Talk about devastating double act!

You’ll find all the products I’ve recommended at online beauty boutique Escentual.com. Here’s hoping your big night is as much fun as mine!

Until next week, stay gorgeous
