When the Roeller family decided to build a snowman as big as a house, they knew it was going to be a tall order.

But the snow kept falling so they kept building - and watched it grow 30 feet into the sky.

Todd Roeller and his three sons, 
Tanner, Tyler, and Hunter, helped by a team of their cousins, began the mammoth task in relatives Harvey and Darlene Gardner's back yard, in Orem, Utah, just before Christmas.

Tall order: Family members, from left, Tanner Roeller, Taylor Madsen, Harvey Gardner, Darlene Gardner, Preston Madsen, and Devere Gardner. The rest of the family involved have gone back home or to college. The snowman is so big that he has a fridge box for a head

And by New Year, their towering creation could be seen across the neighbourhood.

The snowman is so big that they used a fridge box for a hat and made a giant scarf out of felt to wrap around its neck.

But despite all that hard work, Todd says the real achievement was working together as a family.

'The time we got to spend together with my dad and brothers is irreplaceable,' Roeller said. 'It brought us a lot closer together and that was great.'

It has even begun attracting local sightseers who have flocked to the snowman to take pictures.

Now that the family members have gone back home or to college, Harvey and Darlene Gardner still wake up each morning to see the snowman's Christmas tree decoration eyes staring back at them through their upstairs bedroom window.

It is a permanent reminder of the magic a family Christmas can bring.

'It's going to be there a long time,' said Darlene Gardner, smiling.
