Liverpool have their swagger back and are charging towards claiming a place in next season's Champions League.

Their latest victory at Southampton, which has put them within touching distance of the top four, showed them to be resilient, confident and organised – a far cry from when their season looked as if it might combust in November.

But how has it all turned around? Here Sportsmail examines the key areas that have been crucial in the Reds' revival.

ALL ABOUT THE SYSTEM

During the depths of Liverpool's bad run in the autumn, when they were losing games and looking distinctly ordinary, Brendan Rodgers had a number of nights when, unable to sleep, he ended up pacing the floor of his kitchen trying to find a remedy for his team's ills.

The bold decision to switch to 3-4-3 from 4-2-3-1 has transformed Liverpool. Though they lost the first game in which it was deployed – 3-0 at Manchester United on December 14 – they are been unbeaten in the subsequent 10 Barclays Premier League fixtures, winning seven and drawing three.

It was a brave call. Rodgers was under scrutiny and had it backfired, the criticism would have intensified. But the courage he had in his convictions has reaped dividends. The way the team is set up also allows some who had previously looked uncomfortable, such as Mamadou Sakho and Alberto Moreno, to flourish.

A GOLDEN GLOVES CONTENDER

Had you suggested in November Simon Mignolet would head into spring as being in the running for the Premier League's top goalkeeper award, you would have been laughed out of town. Liverpool's defending was miserable and their No 1's confidence was shot.

The transformation, however, has been remarkable. Mignolet has emerged from a spell in the wilderness and his shutout at St Mary's was his 10th of the campaign – two behind Fraser Forster, who leads the Golden Gloves race.

In front of him, the chemistry between Emre Can, Martin Skrtel and Sakho is also right and that has enabled them to become a tighter unit, with no goals conceded away from home in their last five games. It is a feat that was last achieved in the 1984-85 campaign.

Rodgers was asked when Liverpool were shipping so many goals whether he would bring in a defensive coach. His brusque answer was 'No. No. No chance. No chance. No.' The faith he had in his ability and methods is being proven right.

NEW FACES PLAYING LIKE OLD HANDS

The criticism which came Liverpool's way over their summer transfer policy was ferocious when results plummeted. During this impressive run, though, the emergence of Can, Moreno and Lazar Markovic – combined cost £43million – has been noticeable.

Can, especially, looks a footballer of the highest calibre. A number of clubs, including Manchester United, scouted him last season and it was felt Liverpool had made a shrewd acquisition when they secured his signature. He is over his early teething troubles.

Then there is Mario Balotelli. Whether he is liked or loathed, this point must be made. Liverpool looked at signing Radamel Falcao last summer and he was the preferred option ahead of Balotelli, a star name to fill Luis Suarez's void.

Balotelli has not done a massive amount at Anfield but how crucial might the winner he scored against Tottenham two weeks ago prove to be? Whereas Falcao looks woefully out of sorts and expensive failed gamble, it could turn out that Balotelli has scored the defining goal in the top-four race.

Lazar Markovic joined Liverpool last summer from Benfica for a reported £20million fee

THE LITTLE MAGICIAN

To see Philippe Coutinho play earlier in the year tested the patience. A player with wonderful ability, he was not having anywhere near the desired impact, flitting out of games, never imposing himself away from home and looking flimsy.

The change since has been remarkable. Coutinho has confessed to doing extra training and in recent weeks he created both goals in a 2-0 win against West Ham, scored a stunning goal at Bolton in the FA Cup and then trumped it with a magnificent effort at Southampton.

Rodgers believes he can be Liverpool's Luka Modric. Given the way he is playing, there is no reason to doubt that can't scale those heights.

ALL IN IT TOGETHER

One thing which particularly incensed Rodgers when results dipped was the accusation that Liverpool's dressing room was fractured. He prides himself on having a tight group without cliques and wants to create a working environment with an atmosphere that allows players to thrive.

You can see how close the group is now judging by the way they have been celebrating goals in recent weeks. Whoever has scored, be it Rickie Lambert at Aston Villa or Raheem Sterling at St Mary's, the players have joined in en masse. Lucas Leiva even leapt into the crowd at Villa Park.  

They are all, clearly, pulling in the same direction and that unity will be crucial if Liverpool are going to see the job through and qualify for the Champions League. Difficult assignments loom in the next six weeks but, at present, Liverpool have the form and confidence to meet them head on.  

Brendan Rodgers has done well to ensure that the morale in Liverpool's dressing room has not dropped
