With a win for the Queen, a jacket 
made using a 3D printer and some seriously flamboyant hats, Royal 
Ascot's Ladies Day proved one of the most colourful - and exciting - to 
date.

But it's reputation 
for being the most glamorous day of the race meet could be under threat 
if these incredible photos from today's event are any indication.

The Queen was radiant, her face wreathed in smiles, as she was driven down the racecourse on day four of the annual race meeting. Bookies were also thrilled to see that she was finally wearing blue, a delicate cornflower shade, thus avoiding the bumper payouts of the first three days.

Her second son, the Duke of York, accompanied his mother and later joined the Countess of Wessex who arrived ahead of the rest of the royal family looking elegant in black.

Thrilled: The Queen looked radiant and was clearly still on a high courtesy of yesterday's win as she arrived at Royal Ascot for a fourth day of racing

Family affair: Her Majesty was joined by her second son, the Duke of York, and her daughter in law, Sophie Countess of Wessex, who looked lovely in black

Happy: The Queen is known for her love of racing and is never happier than when with her horses, which include Gold Cup winning thoroughbred filly, Estimate

Dapper: Prince Michael of Kent looked super in his neat grey suit and top hat, while his wife looked lovely in a pale powder blue coat and matching hat

Ravishing:
 The Countess of Wessex looked wonderful in a beautiful black skirt suit
 topped off with an elegant hat that worked perfectly with her diamond 
earrings

Chic: Jemma Kidd was ravishing in a navy blue frock and a delicate, cream pillbox hat as she arrived on the arm of her husband, Arthur, Earl of Mornington

Glamorous: TycoonTim Jefferies appeared ready for rain as he arrived with his wife, Malin Johansson. Glen Johnson, meanwhile, appeared in a smart grey suit

Cheerful: TV stylist Brix Smith-Start appeared 
to be in high spirits as she arrived for day four of Royal Ascot in a 
pretty pansy print dress and a bold cerise hat

In the paddock, make-up artist Jemma Kidd, now the Countess of Mornington, appeared on the arm of her handsome husband, Arthur, Earl of Mornington, looking wonderful in petrol blue..

Also on hand for day for was business tycoon Tim Jefferies who arrived with his stunning Swedish wife, Malin. Other famous faces included footballer, Glen Johnson, and former Steps singer, Lisa Scott-Lee.

Elsewhere, the supersized hats, pretty summer blooms, bold brights and some stunningly elegant ensembles could all be seen as racegoers arrived for the fourth day of Royal Ascot - joined by TV stylist Brix Smith-Start who was ravishing in a floral print dress and cerise hat.

There were spots of rain in the air 
before racing started, but the sun threatened to break through the 
clouds, creating a dank muggy feel to the start of the day.

The crowd - expected to be 60,000-strong - began to flood through the gates after midday. Carla Goss, 34, of Godalming, Surrey, looked pretty in pink with a 
short, figure-hugging dress matched with white heels and a large white 
hat.

She said: 'This is my first time here and it's very exciting. I love how everyone gets dressed up. I'm here with some friends. We decided to take the day off work for a treat.'

The talking point of the day for racing fans was top fillies Sky Lantern
 and Just The Judge renewing their rivalry in the Coronation Stakes. But centre of attention was The Queen's Vase, which was being run in 
memory of legendary trainer Sir Henry Cecil who died last week.

Jockeys in the race were due to wear black armbands to pay tribute to Sir Henry, who won the contest an astonishing eight times. His horse Disclaimer was running for his widow Lady Cecil, who has 
temporarily taken over the training licence at his Newmarket stables.

She was a winner in the Ribblesdale Stakes with Riposte on yesterday and was on hand to congratulate the Queen when the latter's horse, bay filly Estimate, triumphed in the Gold Cup.

With the Ascot fashion police out in force, a designer wine handbag has been launched in an attempt to fend off the racecourse's style enforcers.

The Â£29.99 bags, which reference designs by French fashion house Louis Vuitton, can store up to 1.5 litres of wine.

Although makers, Firebox.com, have pre-filled them with alcohol, it's not quite Chateau Neuf du Pape. Instead, there's a cheap and cheerful choice of three sorts of plonk - Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Rose.

Despite the less than lovely wine, the company does say that the high gloss cardboard boxes are tough enough to withstand the hustle and bustle of the winners so you won't risk getting red wine all over your race day finery.

Potential winner? Firebox.com has launched a cardboard wine carrier that resembles a designer handbag in order to foil Royal Ascot's famed fashion police
