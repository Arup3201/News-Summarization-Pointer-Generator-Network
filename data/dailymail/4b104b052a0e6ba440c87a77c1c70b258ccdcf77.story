Emmanuel Jack, 27, who police believe was behind dating profiles used to con women out of cash, has been jailed for laundering £186,000 of their money through his bank accounts

A student has been jailed for three years after six lonely women were scammed out of £186,000 through dating websites.

Police believe Emmanuel Jack, 27, created dating profiles before asking women to hand over cash.

That money then passed through bank accounts belonging to Jack.

Jack, who was studying at the University of Salford, admitted 11 counts of money laundering totalling £186,000 and possession of articles for use in fraud and was jailed for three years at Manchester Crown Court today.

Detective Constable Stuart Donohue, from Greater Manchester Police said: 'While we strongly suspect - but cannot prove - that Jack was the person who was communicating with these women, what we can prove is that money has been transferred through his bank accounts.

'Women from across the globe were targeted and exploited. Women, who in most cases were vulnerable and lonely.

'Some took out loans and others have lost life savings.

'From speaking with these women it is apparent that they believed they were speaking with a man who had genuine feelings for them, a man who loved them and wanted to be with them and who they genuinely believed to be a soul mate.'

The first victim met a man who claimed to be John Creed - a self-employed architect and building contractor on a dating website in August 2011 when she was aged 61.

The pair exchanged emails over several days before Creed said that he loved her.

He then claimed to have a contract for building log homes in Shropshire and another to renovate six flats in Sweden and sent her paperwork which showed they were allegedly worth £950,000.

He told her that his feelings were 'too strong to ignore' before asking for £1,500 to help pay for supplies for his project.

Jack was today sentenced to three years behind bars after admitting 11 charges of money laundering

After the victim repeatedly questioned the request, a man phoned her and accused her of not trusting him.

Feeling guilty, she agreed to transfer some funds to the account given - which was then sent to Jack’s account.

Also in August 2011 another woman, aged 52 at the time, began chatting with a man over the same website.

The man claimed to be living in Spain and working as an architect and building contractor.

After a couple of weeks he again asked for £1,500 to repair damaged machinery and said that he would reimburse the woman as soon as he returned to the UK.

He then asked for cash to pay tax bills before asking for more money to pay his workers.

The woman took out a loan before paying the money, which was again transferred to Jack's accounts.

An investigation was launched after the two women reported their suspicions to the police, and Jack was arrested in April 2012.

Officers then investigated his bank accounts and discovered payments of £7,800.00 on March 6 2012 and £31,750 on March 15 2012 from a woman in Burkesville, Kentucky.

Before her death in 2013, the woman had given a statement to Kentucky police in which she said  she met a man with the profile name John Windsor through another dating site around January 2012.

Jack was a student at Salford University (file picture) studying business at the time of the offences

Windsor said he was an engineer who had been awarded a contract to redevelop Wick Airport runway in Scotland.

The funds were sent to bank accounts by money transfers and in the form of Rolex watches through the post.

Another victim, from Ohio, said she met a man who called himself John or Johnnie Carlo Rissi who was from America but had moved to England to set up as a gem broker.

Whist apparently on business in Spain he requested money pay taxes and wages, along with various other excuses. Nine transfers totalling $31,640 (£18,924) were sent.

Rissi took another $6,650 (£4,117), which was transferred straight into Jack's accounts.

In total two UK and six foreign victims were identified.

A Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is scheduled to take place on May 16, for the authorities to try to recover the money.
