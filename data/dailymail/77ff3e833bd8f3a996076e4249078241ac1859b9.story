Education Secretary Nicky Morgan could not spare time to meet a charity planning a series of events to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo

The campaign to mark the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo has been snubbed by the Education Secretary, it emerged yesterday.

Organisers are planning a series of events next year to commemorate Britain’s defeat of Napoleon in 1815 – and have prepared teaching materials for schools.

But officials at the Department for Education have responded to a letter from the leaders of Waterloo 200 saying Nicky Morgan had no time to meet them. 

And the Education Secretary’s aides have also told the Mail that neither she nor any official from the ministry will meet the campaigners.

David Huse of Waterloo 200 said: ‘I don’t understand why you wouldn’t want to sit down for half an hour and go through what we want to do. 

'It raises the prospect that they’re genuinely not interested in this, one of the most significant events in our history.

‘The battle was a monumental occasion in our history and to involve some schools in what we are doing is a creative way of raising awareness of it. 

'I’m very concerned that the Department for Education isn’t engaged in the celebrations for the battle and I would like them more engaged in it.’

Despite not having time to meet the campaigners, Mrs Morgan, who is also minister for women and equalities did manage, in October, to attend the second annual PinkNews Awards, hosted by the gay news service. There she presented an award to a group of university students who posed as ‘naked rowers’ to raise money for anti-bullying causes.

Since she replaced Michael Gove in the summer, Mrs Morgan has become known as ‘Ms U-turn’ for reversing a number of policies, including scrapping the system of allowing misbehaving children to be punished by making them run around a playing field.

She has also changed her position on gay marriage, saying she is now in favour despite having voted against the idea only last year. Major General Sir Evelyn Webb-Carter, who chairs Waterloo 200, said: ‘I just hope we can find other ways of ensuring that history teachers know what is available.’

Organisers are planning an anniversary concert at the Royal Albert Hall and a commemoration service on June 18 at St Paul’s Cathedral. They have formed a committee of teacher and academics to create resources for teachers and a dedicated website supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund.

They wrote to the Department for Education last month, describing their work and requesting a meeting with Mrs Morgan or one of her officials to discuss how they could work together.

But a civil servant replied on Mrs Morgan’s behalf, saying she was unable to accept because of ‘pressures on her diary’. The letter said she could not agree to all requests.

When contacted about the story, a source close to Mrs Morgan said she had not seen the original letter. However, he confirmed she was still not prepared to meet anyone from the campaign.

He added: ‘This Government has helped ensured children will learn about Waterloo thanks to our reforms of the national curriculum. The French revolutionary wars – which Waterloo ended – are singled out as one of the topics which 11 to 14-year-olds should cover.

‘Waterloo 200 has already held discussions with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport which is leading on the 200th anniversary.’

Another source said Mrs Morgan’s focus was on ‘getting out of Whitehall’ and ‘visiting schools and hearing from teachers, pupils and parents directly’.

Wellington’s victory at Waterloo in alliance with Prussia and the Dutch helped Britain become the world’s pre-eminent power.
