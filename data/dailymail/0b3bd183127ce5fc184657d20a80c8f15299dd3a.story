A horse rider left with injuries she says have destroyed her sex life after she was chased by an out-of-control dog is suing the animal's owner for more than Â£300,000.

Gillian Spencer, 51, and her horse were chased by an Alaskan Malamute owned by Philip Terry in Chobham Common, Surrey in January 2011, causing her to fall.

The mother-of-two has now launched a High Court law suit against Mr Terry, claiming the incident has left her with spinal and arm injuries.

The Evening
 Standard reported that the horse ridden by British Airways worker Ms 
Spencer was bitten by one of six dogs Mr Terry was walking on 
the Common.

Court
 documents quoted by the paper claim Ms Spencer's horse bolted following
 the bite and she was knocked unconscious for 45 minutes after falling in a nearby wood.

According to her claim, she has since needed surgery on her spine, suffers disrupted function in her right arm and has an abnormal gait when walking.

Whereas
 she was once a fit and health woman, she now has difficulty writing, is
 unable to run or apply make-up and no longer has sex, the High Court writ 
states.

Mr Terry 
was convicted of having a dog dangerously out of control in a public 
place at Guildford Magistrates Court in October 2011 and later took his 
dog to a specialist to try to stop it chasing other animals.

Ms
 Spencer, of Sunninghill, Berkshire, who says she was off work for two 
years following the fall, claims that Mr Terry was negligent by failing 
to have the dog on a lead.

Alaskan Malamutes are husky-like dogs, originally bred in the North American Arctic Circle to pull sleds through the snow.
