A Texas woman and her two-year-old daughter have been mauled by her boyfriend's pit bull, leaving them both hospitalized.

The girl needed facial surgery after suffering injuries to her head and face, while her mother, 23-year-old Chelsi Camp, sustained injuries to her arms and hands as she tried to protect her child.

Authorities said Camp called 911 and police arrived at their apartment in League City at 8.45am to find her trying to stop the pit bull as he cornered her daughter Mackenzie in the bathroom.

Attack: Chelsi Camp and her two-year-old daughter Mackenzie have both been hospitalized after Camp's boyfriend's pit bull attacked them on Monday morning. Mackenzie suffered injuries to her face

Police said the dog was still attacking the girl when they arrived and an officer shot the animal to stop the attack so other officers could help the mother and daughter.

'It was a very bad scene,' Reagan Pena with the League City Police Department told KHOU, adding of Camp: 'Obviously she was trying to prevent the dog from attacking her child.'

Authorities said the dog had suddenly turned on the girl but they did not know why.

The animal was shot once at the scene but did not die, authorities said. Animal control later euthanized the dog and it was carried away from the scene in a body bag.

Victims: Mackenzie was airlifted to hospital and underwent surgery; her mother was taken by ambulance

The little girl was airlifted to Memorial
 Hermann Hospital and was in stable condition, but an updated condition has not been made available.

According to her uncle's Facebook page, she underwent facial surgery on Monday evening.

Her mother was taken by ambulance to the same hospital and was in good condition at the hospital later on Monday.

Authorities said Camp, who is an apartment manager at the Avana at South Shore apartments, had been looking after the dog for her boyfriend, who was not home.

Neighbors became emotional as they spoke about the attack and the young family.

'She's a wonderful person and her little girl is a sweetheart,' neighbor Maria DuBose told Click2Houston.

League City police told KHOU that charges are unlikely in this case and it may be instead considered a 'family incident'.

Animal control will conduct its own investigation into the attack.
