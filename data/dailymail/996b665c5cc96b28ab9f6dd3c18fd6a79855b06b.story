A millionaire who made his fortune on the London property market and once dated model Caprice has died after falling under a Tube train.

Robert Curtis, 47, was said to have lived 'the high life' after launching a successful business letting upmarket properties in the early 2000s.

But his life spiralled into disarray after his business empire crumbled during the recession as well as personal tragedies including the suicide of his friend Paul Castle and a failed marriage.

Mr Curtis died at Kingsbury station. Polo-playing Mr Castle, 54, a friend of Prince Charles, threw himself in front of a train at Bond Street station as he faced bankruptcy and illness two years ago last month, the London Evening Standard reports tonight.

Known to friends as 'Robbie', Mr Curtis made a fortune in the property boom with string of successful letting businesses run from his St John’s Wood HQ.

He had a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce with personalised number plate and wardrobes full of designer clothes.

The father-of-one crossed the world for parties and business meetings before divorce and financial problems took their toll.His main money spinner was as an agent for letting expensive properties, a booming market in the early Noughties.

At different times, he was a director of 15 firms, Companies House records show.

But by the time he died all but one had folded as the recession burst the property bubble.He suffered from depression and his life fell apart, according to friends and neighbours at the Barnet mansion block where he moved when his marriage ended, living there with his  mother, Pamela, and father, Monty, until three months ago.His parents now live in sheltered accommodation in Kingsbury, where Mr Curtis died at the local station under a Jubilee line train two weeks ago.

His former accountant Anthony Morris paid tribute today to a 'cavalier, ebullient' businessman prone to highs and lows.'Robbie made tons of money and spent it, he was a mover and shaker,' he said. 'He lived the high life.' He said he had heard Mr Curtis dated Caprice: 'That’s the kind of life he was leading.' He said Mr Curtis considered property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz his mentor in the business world and the two became close friends.

Neighbours in Barnet described Mr Curtis as courteous. One said: 'His mother was unwell and he and his father were looking after her. He was a very caring son who paid for the place where they were living.'He moved here after his marriage broke up. His wife and daughter used to visit.'

Another neighbour said: 'He had a relationship with a girl and gave her a ring and money. More or less the day after... she went to Iran, and he was very upset.'Mr Curtis’s parents were too upset to speak about his death. Police said the death is being treated as non-suspicious.
