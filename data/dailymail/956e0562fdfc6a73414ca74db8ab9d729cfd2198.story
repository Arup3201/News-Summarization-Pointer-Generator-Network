Wales international Liam Williams  has issued an apology for a fancy dress costume in which he 'blacked-up' as Premier League striker Wilfried Bony.

Williams, 23, posted a picture on Twitter of himself dressed as the Swansea striker wearing full face paint.

He was slammed for imitating Bony, who has scored eight times this season, with many labelling his outfit 'racist'.

Williams, who plays for the Scarlets issued an apology and claimed Bony gave the costume his blessing

But Williams. a full-back for Scarlets, said Bony gave the costume his blessing. 

The image was retweeted 160 times and favourited 345 times after Williams shared it with his 31,000 Twitter followers.

But Show Racism the Red Card urged Williams - who has featured in one of the charity's campaigns - to apologise for the picture.

Campaign manager Sunil Patel said: 'We are disappointed to see the image on his Twitter feed. It's not acceptable as we move into 2015.

'We don't condone this sort of behaviour, especially when we have got issues of racism in sport and society.

'I can't comment on whether Wilfried is fine with it, but I am sure many black people would not be fine with it.

'It is behaviour we do not really like to see. It's something we might have seen 30 or 40 years ago but it is not something we expect to see in a multicultural society.

'We would call upon him to apologise for the image.'

Williams was pictured alongside team-mates Harry Robinson, Michael Tagicakibau and Rhys Priestland and an unidentified man dressed as a donkey.

Williams, who later deleted the picture, told his critics to 'shut up' and claimed Bony had given him his permission to wear the costume.

Williams said: 'There's not a racist bone in my body. 'I know Bony through a mutual friend and he said it was OK so no offence taken.'

He later tweeted: 'I am very sorry for any offence caused by my actions. I'm not a racist and there was no malice behind it.'

The sports body is investigating the image. A spokesman said: 'At this stage we would like to receive the full facts and background of the situation before commenting further.'

In the summer Williams became a pariah after conceding a last-minute penalty against South Africa. Wales were 30-24 ahead and on the cusp of their first win against one of the southern hemisphere heavyweights in six years.

Williams was penalised for making an illegal shoulder charge on Cornal Hendricks as he scored a try in the corner. The resulting penalty try gave South Africa a simple conversion to win 31-30 in the closing moments of the game.
