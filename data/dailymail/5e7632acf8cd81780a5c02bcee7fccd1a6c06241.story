Zlatan Ibrahimovic is not all that keen on the officials in France.

Just last week the Swedish powerhouse lost his temper following a 3-2 defeat to Bordeaux and publically criticised the state of refereeing in the division.

But it seems that Ibrahimovic is far from popular himself in France following a poll taken by French publication Le Parisien.

Just 15 per cent of those asked in a pole felt Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a good person deep down

Results showed that 79 per cent of those questioned had a poor opinion of the 33-year-old

The French daily asked just over 1,000 readers to answer some questions on the former Barcelona and Milan ace and the results were none too positive.

Results showed that 79 per cent of those questioned had a poor opinion of the 33-year-old, while 84 per cent labelled him both hot-headed and arrogant.

Just 15 per cent of those asked felt Ibrahimovic was a good person deep down, but 62 per cent were fully aware of the ability he has and said he was a talented footballer.
