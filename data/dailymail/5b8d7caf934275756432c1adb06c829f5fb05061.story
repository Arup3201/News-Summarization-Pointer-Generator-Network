The first victim of the Rotherham paedophiles to waive her anonymity last night called for South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright to quit.

Sarah Wilson, who fell prey to Asian attackers aged 11, said: ‘You have to hold me back from unleashing my years of torment on him.

‘He was supposed to protect me – instead he let me and thousands of girls and their families down.

‘He needs to face the music and be held accountable. The way he’s trying to cling on to his job is a joke.’

In an earlier family tragedy, Miss Wilson’s younger sister, Laura, died in the UK’s first white honour killing carried out by an Asian boyfriend. She was 17 when she was stabbed and dumped in a canal by Ashtiaq Ashgar.

He murdered her after she told his family about their relationship. Their mother now looks after Laura’s daughter, four, fathered by another Asian man.

Miss Wilson said: ‘It’s time the people who failed me and my murdered sister are rolled out into the public to face their shameful behaviour. No one listened to us for years and now they’ve been found out they think it’s as easy as just resigning and apologising. Nothing can repair the damage their lack of care has caused.’

Miss Wilson told The Sun newspaper she had been abused by dozens of men during a five-year period when she was in and out of care.

The predators plied her with alcohol and cannabis and forced her to perform sexual favours in return.

Having now turned her life around, and eight weeks pregnant with her first child, she said she was speaking out to persuade other victims to come forward. She said she was 11 when she was first targeted, when three men aged around 20 befriended her outside the primary school gates. Then, one day still wearing her school uniform, she was forced to perform a sex act on a 20-year-old.

She added: ‘These men were manipulating me and the authorities should have known that. I was young and bullied but they made me feel part of something.

‘Men right up to their 40s said they were my friends, bought me into their circle and plied me with drink and cannabis. But then they demanded I repay them.

‘They’d take me in their cars to parks, houses, anywhere they wanted and demand I perform sex acts on them or sex. I didn’t know what to do. I felt scared.

‘People forced themselves on me. I spent many hours speaking to authorities who all knew what was going on. But for five years I was allowed to be targeted by vile creatures.’

She said she was taken in by social services half a dozen times and even had an assigned social worker who was ‘very much aware of what was happening’.

Another woman who was abused as a teenager told last night how social workers allowed her to have daily contact with a man ten years older than her who was suspected of grooming dozens of young girls for sex. Katie – not her real name – was one of 54 girls abused by the man she saw as her boyfriend, as well as his friends.

She says that despite knowing he had served two stints in jail for violent crime and was part of a circle of men under investigation for sexual exploitation, social workers allowed her to leave her foster home at night to meet him.

Now 29, she is one of 15 girls bringing a civil case against the council and police. She said ‘people at the top’ had covered up what happened to her and the others.

Katie added: ‘They’re trained to recognise it and they were adults. They’ve got to be stupid not to recognise signs of abuse.’
