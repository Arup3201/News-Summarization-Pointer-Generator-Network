One of the teenage girls doused with battery acid on the island of Zanzibar was released from hospital last night.

Kirstie Trup, 18, who was soaked with acid along with her friend Katie Gee, also 18, in the horrifying attack last week, will return to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on Thursday to undergo skin grafts, her mother Rochelle has said.

Miss Gee, who is said to have suffered burns to 80 per cent of her right arm and 50 per cent of her torso, remains in hospital where she is expected to undergo surgery.

Mrs Trup, 49, told the Evening Standard: 'I can confirm that Kirstie has been temporarily discharged until Thursday when she’s back in for a skin graft. We won’t make any comments regarding Katie.'

Miss Gee's mother Nicky Gee declined to comment on her daughter's treatment at what she described as a 'very sensitive time'.

The hospital refused to comment on the girls' condition today.

The Telegraph reports that Miss Trup managed to limit the extent of her injuries by running into the sea. Her father Marc Trup told the paper that the salt water and the acid 'completely altered the result'.

He added: 'The other girl panicked, ran around and made her way to a public toilet.'

Members of 
both girls' families had been keeping a bedside vigil at the hospital, 
where the victims' condition had been described as 'stable'.

Police in Africa have arrested two suspects and questioned six others they believe have 'important information'.

Extremist preacher Sheikh Issa Ponda Issa is understood to be under armed guard in hospital after he was injured while trying to evade police.

He is said to have been shot in the shoulder as he tried to flee in Morogoro, 200 miles from Dar es Salaam.

The Daily Telegraph said Sheikh Issa 
Ponda Issa handed himself in to police a day after he was injured following the attack on the volunteer teachers.

He is understood to have links to Uamsho, a radical Islamist group police suspect may have been involved in the attack.

Acid attacks have become the hallmark of the group which wants Zanzibar’s independence from Tanzania and Sharia law to be imposed on the island.

The cleric visited Zanzibar in the weeks leading up to the attack on the British girls and was seen encouraging his supporters to protest against ‘colonisation’ from Christians and inciting Muslim youths to violence.

Miss Trup and Miss Gee were flown home from Africa in an emergency air ambulance and immediately sent to the capital's regional burns centre on Friday.

Asked whether the victims of such an attack as they suffered would be likely to require surgery, plastic surgeon Dr Mohammad Jawad told MailOnline: 'Most certainly.'

Dr Jawad, who helped to rebuild model and television presenter Katie Piper's face after she was wounded by an acid attack, said full assessment were likely to be carried out under general anaesthetic to establish the depths of the burns suffered.

The surgeon said treatment plans would be discussed with each patient and that they would undergo skin grafts. 'The aim is to get the area healed in a normal way and reconstruct what is lost, and of course we are all looking for aesthetically pleasing outcomes.'

Dr Jawad said further treatment could take place in the future following initial procedures, and added that the victims would need 'plenty of psychological support and good scar management'.

One friend of the pair told how one of the two men involved in the unprovoked attack 'smiled' before throwing acid.

Speaking
from Zanzibar, medical student Olivia Moore told Channel 4 News: 'The 
two men were on a moped and they went past a group of tourists.

'They
stopped for the girls and the two men then looked at each other, 
nodded, and then the man on the back of the bike smiled and threw acid 
on the girls.

'From then on it's just chaotic. There was no incident that preceded the actual attack.

'Everyone was shocked. Nobody can think of a motivation or anything that precipitated this.'

Miss Gee has already taken to Twitter to thank well-wishers for their support, while a photograph released by the teenagers' families showed the injuries one of them suffered in the attack.

The young women were enjoying the last week of a trip as volunteer teachers to the predominantly Muslim island when the corrosive substance was thrown at them in an apparently unprovoked attack.

They had originally planned to return in time to collect their A-level results this week, with Miss Trup hoping to study history at the University of Bristol while Miss Gee is considering the University of Leeds, it was reported.
