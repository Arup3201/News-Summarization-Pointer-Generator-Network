IF you are looking to buy a home, an area with good transport links, decent schools and low crime usually tops the wish list.

But homebuyers might also want to find out if there are any plans to open a Waitrose in the neighbourhood.

A branch of the upmarket store near your home could boost prices by up to 50 per cent, according to estate agents.

Premium: Having a branch of Waitrose in a postcode can add up to 50 per cent to the value of homes, according to research by Savills

They examined how the cost of homes with a Waitrose in the same postcode compared to those in the rest of the same county.

The verdict was that the typical price of properties with a nearby branch was 25.3 per cent higher. For example, a home in Amersham, which has a neighbourhood Waitrose, typically costs £456,000, while the average for Buckinghamshire is £360,000.

The situation is even more extreme in  London, where a local branch can add an astonishing 50.3 per cent to average prices.

Most expensive: The top 20 locations with the highest 'Waitrose premium' all have house prices at least 40 per cent above their local county average

‘Our analysis identifies a very clear 
house price premium in Waitrose store locations,’ said Sophie Chick, a 
research analyst at Savills, which carried out the study. ‘It is 
difficult to state with certainty that a Waitrose opening will boost 
prices. But it is clear that buyers should expect to pay significantly 
more for their home if they wish to have a store on their doorstep.’

She looked at Waitrose branches which have opened in the past five years and house prices in the same ‘postcode district’. These are locations which share the same first half of a postcode, such as SW3 or GU7.

Miss Chick admitted there was ‘no real answer’ to whether Waitrose ‘gentrifies’ areas or if the chain only opens in areas which are already upmarket and so more expensive.

The findings come as figures from the Land Registry showed that house prices in London are rising by £90 a day. But, in stark contrast, they are falling in most other towns and cities, including Birmingham, Bradford, Leeds,  Liverpool and Manchester.

In the capital, the average home costs £374,568 after jumping 9.6 per cent in the last year. That is equal to an increase of £32,809 since March last year.

Of properties selling for more than £1million in England and Wales, roughly two-thirds were in London. Around 13 homes every day change hands for more than £1million in the capital, according to the Land Registry.

In Liverpool, house prices fell 4 per cent since March last year. The average home used to cost £93,514 but its value dropped to £89,974, a fall of £3,540 or nearly £10 a day. In Middlesbrough, prices fell 16.5 per cent.

Overall, the Land Registry said the average house price in England and Wales is £161,793, up 0.9 per cent over the last year.

Peter Rollings, chief executive of estate agency Marsh & Parsons, said the capital  continued ‘to operate in another realm’.

Giles Hannah, managing director of upmarket estate agency VanHan, said: ‘International buyers, particularly from Asia, are fuelling demand.’ He said a weak pound meant they could reap big discounts on prices.
