They have just witnessed a military coup in their nation’s capital, but people in Thailand are being urged to embrace ‘happiness’ – starting with free haircuts.

Army bosses, who just weeks ago seized power in Bangkok, say perking up the mood in the country is a top priority and want to reinstate Thailand as the ‘Land of Smiles’.

Now the military junta, known as the National Council for Peace and Order, has ordered a series of events including road clean-ups, army-band concerts and free haircuts for civilians.

The scheme was outlined by army chief General Prayith Chan-ocha in a national address, according to the Samui Times website.

Outlining his vision for the country, which includes up to three months of ‘national reconciliation and constitutional reforms, he is reported as saying: ‘Thai people, like me, have probably not been happy for nine years, but since May 22, there is happiness.’

Soldiers from the Saraburi province have already been ordered to carry out a ‘Big Cleaning Day’ around the Victory Monument in the centre of Bangkok – recently the site of anti-coup protests.

According to the website, the army said this was done in an effort to bring ‘beauty and cleanliness back to the people.

Soldiers also temporarily swapped their weapons for guitars, keyboards and drums during free concerts.

Residents were also offered free desserts and haircuts during the musical events.

The NCPO is also expected to air weekly television shows aimed at keeping residents up to date with their moves to make people happy.

But it has not been plain sailing for the army since seizing power. A soldier is pictured taking cover behind a speaker during heated demonstrations in Bangkok just days ago

An army spokesman told the website: ‘It will be an explanation of the NCPO’s works, and will answer people’s questions.’

General Prayuth Chan-ocha seized power on May 22 and has since led a determined crackdown that has stifled dissent and silenced the ‘red shirt’ supporters of former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and her brother, billionaire former premier Thaksin Shinawatra.

The military has detained many politicians and activists and demanded as a condition of release that they sign documents stating they would avoid politics and halt anti-coup activities.

The junta has also banned political meetings of more than five people and at the weekend flooded Bangkok with thousands of troops and policemen to stifle dissent.

Opposition to the coup has been limited to small flash mob protests, and they have for the most part been peaceful.

Some Bangkok protesters have sat in groups of less than five reading books about civil disobedience or that critique authoritarian government, such as George Orwell's ‘1984’.
