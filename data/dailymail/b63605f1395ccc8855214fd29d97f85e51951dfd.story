Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton has revealed he enjoys playing the guitar to his two dogs when he is not on the race track.

Hamilton, who won the world title in November after beating Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to first place, posted a picture of himself serenading his dogs Roscoe and Coco.

The 30-year-old said: 'One of my favourite things to do when I have the time, is to relax & play my guitar. Roscoe and Coco join in and sing! #ilovemusic #bestdogs #TeamLH.'

Hamilton appears to be a big fan of his dogs with the racing driver even deciding to bring Roscoe with him to the 2014 BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards. 

Bulldog Roscoe was pictured with Hamilton, who won the top gong at the ceremony in Glasgow, on the red carpet before picking up his award.

Hamilton will be able to spend some more time with his two dogs over the next month as the 2015 Formula One season does not start until the middle of March.
