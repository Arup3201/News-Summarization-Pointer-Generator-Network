'That man’s evil, he’s a beast, he’s a 
paedophile. In fact jail’s too good for him,' says Tracy Brown. 'I feel bitter towards him
 because he’ll never realise what he’s done.'

Tracy and her twin sister Rachel Steadwood, now 38 and from Edinburgh, were just six years old when their childhood came to an abrupt end.

Unbeknown to each other, both had been attacked and brutally raped by a man they considered to be family, the husband of their Aunt Mary, John McCallum.

Innocent: The twins were just six years old when they were first raped by Mccallum

Appallingly, the abuse continued for more than a decade, only ending when Mary divorced her husband.

It took another 20 years before the twins plucked up the courage to go to the police and last September, the pair were finally given the justice they craved when McCallum was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his crimes.

Despite the verdict, however, the pair say they will never get over what happened to them and will never forgive their 'monster' uncle.

The girls' ordeal began in the summer of 1978, while they were staying with their much-loved Aunt Mary, then 16, who was married to a 19-year-old traveller named John McCallum.

For the twins, the carefree summers spent travelling were the highlight of their year, with both remembering golden days spent roaming the countryside around Loanhead in Midlothian.

'Aunty Mary was like a second mum,' remembers Tracy. 'Even 
now I love her to bits.  She was always there, we used to like school 
holidays, constantly we used to go with her.'

'We went all over the place,' adds Rachel. 'We'd stay in caravans, trailers, as you would class them.  It was totally exciting.'

But the idyll was about to turn into a nightmare as McCallum, previously thought of as a 'nice man' by the twins, turned his peverted attentions to first Tracy and then Rachel.

'After raping me, he opened the door and acted as 
normal,' remembers Tracey of the first time her uncle attacked her.

Tracy, who, like her sister, was repeatedly abused between the ages of six and 13, adds: 'I remember him turning round and saying that there could be blood there as well. And I remember that I cried myself to sleep that night.

'I thought I must have done something wrong. I must have done something for him to have done that 
because you just don’t do that to people.

'It took me a 
long time to realise I never done nothing wrong.  It wasn’t me, it was 
him.  He was in the wrong.'

Evil: John McCallum, from Midlothian, was sentenced to 10 years for his crimes in September 2013

She adds: 'You’re only a wee child, and how do you know that’s not normal?'

It wasn't long before Rachel too fell victim to McCallum. 'Aunty Mary was away - I think she was at 
my granny’s,' she recalls.

'And John shouted me to come 
through to his bed. And he got himself on 
top of me. His exact words, on my telling him it was sore, him telling me it would be alright, it’d only hurt for a minute.

'It wasn’t my fault, I didn’t have a choice,' she continues. 'This man done what he did to us, and there was nothing I could do about it.

'I wasn’t strong enough then.  Then I didn’t think I’d have been believed 
because, well, I was feared I was feared of destroying everybody’s life,
 my Aunty Mary’s life.'

The abuse continued for more than a decade but, incredibly, neither twin knew what was happening to the other.

Both, however, began struggling at school, regularly missing classes, and grew apart with both harbouring resentment towards the other.

'I never thought that it was happening to Rachel,' says Tracy. 'I just believed it was happening to me because I was his special twin.

Childhood: The girls spent childhood summers staying with their aunt Mary on a traveller camp like this one

'I’ve blamed her, I thought I was the 
only one, and I’ve blamed her all my life basically for not getting 
anything what I got. But you know what? She got it too - she’s been punished 
all her life as well.'

Their ordeal finally came to an end when their Aunt Mary, fed up with her husband's womanising ways, divorced him in 1986 when the girls were 13.

Although they soon lost contact with McCallum, both suffered flashbacks and Tracy succumbed to severe depression.

Rachel, meanwhile, found herself spiralling into a vicious circle of drugs, unstable relationships and even contemplated suicide.

'I never dealt with it because it’s there 
every day of your life,' she says. 'I thought I was getting through life OK but I wasn't because I ended up taking
 drugs, I tried to take my own life twice.

'I’ve fought eating disorders,
 I fought depression, so I’ve had a multitude of things, all while thinking that I
 was coping when I wasn’t coping, but that was my way of getting through
 what had happened to me.'

For more than 17 years, the sisters kept the truth about McCallum to themselves, telling no one - not even each other - until, during a rare meeting at their brother David's funeral - they finally plucked up the courage to confide in each other.

Idyll: The girls' childhood in a beautiful part of Scotland were ruined by McCallum's appalling crimes

'We were sitting at the front door, and I
 asked her had any bad things ever happened to her, and she says “yes.”,' recalls Tracy.

'We never spoke about it again. I was so sad - even now we’ve never really sat down and really spoke about it.'

While the sisters struggled to come to terms with what had happened, McCallum remained free and continued as he always had.

But after a chance conversation between Rachel and her aunt Mary, his trouble-free lifestyle was about to come to an end.

'I thought she thought that we 
had been with him in that [sexual] sense, so I looked at her and I went: “It’s not
 what you think.”

'And she looked at me and she went: “What do you 
mean?”  I went: “We didn’t have a choice.”  She went: "What do you mean, 
you didn’t have a choice?” 

'I went: “We didn’t, he raped us, sexually abused us.”  And that was it, that was the start of it.'

Days later, the sisters finally reported McCallum to the police and he was arrested within hours. In September 2013, he went on trial for the rapes and sexual assaults of his two nieces more than 30 years earlier.

Despite protesting his innocence and later offering to take a lie detector test, the 15-strong jury found him guilty on two counts of rape and four other sexual offences, and he was handed a 10 year prison term.

For the sisters, the overwhelming emotion was one of relief. 'Finally, I could speak out and tell everybody 
what an animal he was,' says Rachel.

'I didn’t have to be scared of him any longer. I could stand up and shout as loud as I
 wanted: “That man raped me, that man sexually abused me, that man’s a 
monster."'

'That man took my life, that’s 
what he done,' adds Tracy. 'He put me in the dark but now I’m out of the dark 
and I’ve got my life back.'

And the twins, torn apart by what happened to them, have since revived their relationship and say they're now closer than ever.

'I 
could never have done this without my sister, she’s my world, she’s my 
twin now,' adds Tracey. 'I used to have a sister, but now I’ve got my twin - something I
 should have had all my life, but he destroyed that. 

'But now 
I’ve got her and he can’t destroy it anymore.'
