Fulham defender Fernando Amorebieta is in talks over a move to Granada.

The 29-year-old arrived on a Bosman transfer after leaving Athletic Bilbao last summer but has only made 22 appearances and is keen to move on.

His wages may be an issue however for the Spanish side, who are currently 15th in La Liga.
