He was on the arm of a supermodel who had claimed one of the biggest fashion accolades of the evening.

But it was Sir Tom Jones rather than Kate Moss who emitted a golden glow.

The Welsh singer chaperoned the model as she left the British Fashion Awards on Monday evening and headed to The Playboy Club in Mayfair, London, where she was hosting a late night soiree for the 60th anniversary of the magazine.

And Sir Tom’s perma-tan left 39-year-old Miss Moss looking wintery pale in comparison.

The well weathered 73-year-old who spends most of his time in Los Angeles was in London for a flying visit to attend the fashion event and found himself in the position of being Miss Moss’s companion for the evening.

Sir Tom looked to be positively glowing as his skin appeared tangerine against his white goatee and curly white hair.

Wearing a pair of black trousers, a dark t-shirt and a grey suit jacket the dull outfit did nothing to dull down the singer’s sunned face.

Host Miss Moss – who was in the mood to for a joint celebration to mark accepting the Special Recognition Award for more than 20 years of sustained success on the catwalk and to celebrate her cover-shoot for Playboy magazine’s 60th anniversary – stood out in a silver evening dress and knee-length fur coat.

Sir Tom conducted an interview with the prize winner to accompany her recent Playboy shoot, which also coincides with her 40th birthday.

In the flirty chat the singer asked Miss Moss who her dream dinner party guests would be. She replied: ‘Well I would like to have dinner with naughty people who have a story to tell –like you.

‘Jack Nicholson, David Bailey, Stevie Nicks, Catherine Deneuve, Joan Collins. And Hugh Hefner, obviously.’

The pair were joined at the late night bash by many showbiz guests, including M&S model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, One Direction band member Harry Styles, and TopShop owner Sir Philip Green.

Sir Tom will return to our screens with the third BBC1 series of The Voice in January, along with Will.I.Am and new hosts Kylie Minogue and Ricky Wilson, from the Kaiser Chiefs.
