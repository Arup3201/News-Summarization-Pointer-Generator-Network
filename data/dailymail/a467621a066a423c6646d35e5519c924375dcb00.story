Some $50,000 in gold and cash has been swiped from the Hollywood Hills home of Grammy-winning songwriter and producer Toby Gad.

Gad, 46, who has worked with such A-list performers as Beyonce, Madonna, Fergie and John Legend, said his wife discovered Monday that a safe in the home had been broken into.

According to the songwriter, the neighborhood has seen a string of recent burglaries as of late.

Home invasion: Gad's wife, Li Gad, discovered Monday that the safe where they've been keeping their valuables had been cracked in the garage attached to their home in the Hollywood Hills  

Under construction: The Gads' $2million, four-bedroom house was undergoing renovation 

Police responded to Gad's home in the 3500 block of Wonder View Drive after getting a call from his wife at around 4pm.

Detective Raymond Conboy tells KTLA the perpetrators got away with $50,000-$55,000 in cash and gold coins after cracking Gad's safe.

The Gad family's $2million, four-bedroom mansion was undergoing renovation, but the strongbox was located in the garage, which was not part of the remodeling project.

‘We never thought a safe like this could be opened that easily,’ Toby Gad lamented to MyFox LA. ‘It is a very solid safe. All the gold we had in there was taken.’

Li Gad, Toby's wife and the mother of their two children, says she came home Monday afternoon to discover the family's social security cards, passports and other important documents scattered on the floor of the garage.
