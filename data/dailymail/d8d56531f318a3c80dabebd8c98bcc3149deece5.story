Today, led by captain Philipp Lahm, the World Cup-winning German national team disembarked at Berlin's Tegel Airport, holding the trophy aloft as rapturous fans on the viewing terrace sang 'Football's Coming Home'.

The scenes were a far cry from those seen in Ibiza, where Steven Gerrard, captain of England - where football actually comes from - paddled around on a gaudy pedalo in the sea with his family.

The Liverpool midfielder could have been greeting a sea of red and white at Trafalgar Square today. Instead, following England's desultory exit from the World Cup in Brazil, he relaxes in the sun.

Meanwhile, in Berlin: Philipp Lahm holds up the World Cup as the German national team return

The Three Lions flew home nearly three weeks ago after meekly bowing out at the bottom of Group D.

In a grim reminder of what could have been for England fans, the German team went on a parade to the Brandenburg Gate in an open-topped truck after leaving the airport.

The players, in matching black T-shirts bearing the number '1', lapped up the love by playing up to the estimated 400,000 people packing the 'fan mile' in front of the landmark.

Fans began arriving overnight to secure good spots to welcome home coach Joachim Loew's team and the trophy. Germany's fourth World Cup, the first since 1990, crowned years of work by Loew to modernise the team, and followed near misses at recent tournaments.

'We're all world champions!' Loew told the crowd.

Open-topped, but not a bus: Gerrard was at the beach with his wife Alex and their three daughters

He added: 'Of course, it was a long way to the title, and an incredibly tough one in the end. But we're incredibly happy to be here with the fans now.'

At a stage set up at the Gate, Mario Goetze, the scorer in the 1-0 win over Argentina in the final on Sunday, was greeted with deafening cheers by the sea of fans waving black, red and gold Germany flags.

It was a stark contrast to the England team's less-than-triumphant return, where they were greeted by a handful of photographers, but no flag-waving fans, following the team's dismal early World Cup exit.

National glory is starting to slip from the grasp of Gerrard, who will be 36 when the next major international tournament begins

When England landed in the UK, there were no fans to greet them

Lahm has achieved football's ultimate goal, but national glory is starting to slip from the grasp of Gerrard, who will be 36 when the next major international tournament - Euro 2016 in France - takes place.

The midfielder, though, is mainly focusing on getting ready for the new season as Liverpool prepare for another Premier League title race after falling at the final hurdle last year.

Brendan Rodgers' men will travel to Danish side Brondby, tour the United States, and host Borussia Dortmund in a friendly at Anfield on August 10.
