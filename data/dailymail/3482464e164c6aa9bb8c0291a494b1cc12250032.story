Long queues for the changing rooms are the bane of bargain hunters at the post-Christmas sales.

So Marks & Spencer decided to do away with them altogether – an extraordinary decision that has enraged its customers.

In chaotic scenes that were replicated all across the country, a cringing daughter watched her mother strip off on the shop floor in protest after the store refused to change its policy.

Outrage: M&S has faced a massive backlash after closing its fitting rooms during the post-Christmas sales

And a furious father had to get his young daughter to try on clothes surrounded by crowds in the middle of the shop.

M&S faced a massive backlash yesterday after introducing the policy for the first three days of the sales.

One person wrote on Twitter that the strategy was ‘suicide’ and said it would drive away shoppers at a time when high street stores were already struggling.

Others pointed out that by closing the changing rooms the store was throwing away one of the few advantages it has over internet shopping.

And many said they had simply walked out and gone to take their business elsewhere.

M&S staff told shoppers that the changing rooms were shut because of ‘security’ reasons.

But angry customers complained online that branch managers insisted on enforcing the policy even when their stores were ‘virtually empty’.

One furious bargain-hunter from Manchester wrote on Twitter: ‘Just saw an old woman whip her top off on the shop floor of M&S to try on a bra because the changing rooms were closed.’ 

An embarrassed teenage girl from Southampton, posted: ‘Mum’s kicking off in M&S because the changing rooms are shut. Now she’s stripping off in the middle of the shop. I can’t even run away.’

Angry father Richard Stradling posted: ‘Having to try clothes on my little girl on the shop floor as Carmarthen store won’t open their changing rooms! Thanks M&S!’ 

And a woman from Cheshire wrote: ‘I put my purchases back, no other store had their changing rooms closed #poorservice.’ 

According to an M&S spokesman, their changing rooms were closed on Boxing Day and December 27 – but on Saturday 28 they said it had been up to store managers to decide whether or not to keep them shut.

Another debacle: Last week, the major retailer was forced to apologise for letting Muslim checkout staff refuse to serve shoppers buying alcohol or pork (file picture)

They claimed that several other retailers had followed suit – but both Debenhams and John Lewis kept their changing rooms open.

The spokesman added: ‘All of our fitting rooms are now open. 

‘As usual during the busy sales period, we temporarily close our fitting rooms. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.’ 

The policy marks another debacle for M&S after it was forced to apologise last week for letting Muslim checkout staff refuse to serve shoppers buying alcohol or pork.
