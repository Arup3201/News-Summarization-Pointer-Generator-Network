A television station has issued an apology after one of their anchors was caught telling parents to 'do their f***ing jobs' live on air.

Matt Pieper from News 12 The Bronx in New York made the slip up while insulting anyone who relied on government assistance 'for their entire lives' on Wednesday morning.

He then continued to joke about it for a long time, without realizing the camera was still rolling.

Matt Pieper from News 12 The Bronx said parents should 'do their f***ing jobs'while insulting anyone who was on government assistance on Wednesday morning

Thinking it was a commercial break, Pieper was talking to another reporter about school crossing guards when he said: 'Two minutes and Dave [a colleague] wants you to talk about how parents should do their f***ing jobs and take their kids to school and not rely on everyone else, kind of like people who rely on government assistance for their entire lives.'

The other reporter laughs at the joke before Pieper adds: 'It's true, I mean, how old are these kids?' 

In the amateur video that captured the mistake, the person recording says: 'Did he just say that?'

The camera keeps on recording while the anchor neatens up his tie and scratches with no knowledge he has made the huge gaff.

The station was later forced to issue an apology on its Facebook page. 

It read: 'As a result of a technical error during a program break this morning, a personal conversation between an anchor and a reporter was unintentionally placed on the air. 

'The conversation included offensive language and inappropriate commentary. News 12 the Bronx deeply regrets that this incident took place.' 

'The remarks of these individuals in no way reflect the views of News 12 management or other News 12 personnel. Steps have been taken to deal with the employees involved and resolve the technical issues. 

'We take this incident extremely seriously and we sincerely apologize to all who may have been offended.'

It comes in a week that has seen news anchors attracting the wrong sort of attention while doing their jobs.  

Earlier this week Fox News television panelist Eric Bolling asked if a female fighter pilot may be called 'boobs on the ground,' in a joke that viewers have condemned as sexist. 

Reporter Charlo Greene for KTVA-TV in Alaska also shocked her viewers when she revealed revealed the identity of the owner of a medical marijuana business - herself. 

The reporter he is discussing school crossing guards with laughs when she hears the gaff, also not realizing the cameras are rolling

In a Facebook apology, the station blamed a 'technical error' on the airing of the 'personal conversation'
