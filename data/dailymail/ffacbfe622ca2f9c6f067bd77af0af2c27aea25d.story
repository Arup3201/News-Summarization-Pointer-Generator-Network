For £170 per-night you can enjoy the novelty of staying in the world's smallest hotel.

A double room measuring just eight-foot by ten-foot wide is the only room Central Hotel, which fits neatly onto the floor above Copenhagen's Central Cafe. 

With just five indoor seats, the Central Café can also claim to be Copenhagen's smallest coffee shop.

Copenhagen's smallest coffee shop has now opened the world's smallest hotel, with only one tiny double room above it

Owner Leif Thingtved said the small but perfectly formed hotel room is booked all summer

Every corner of the pint-sized room has been used for storage after the owner renovated the empty building

There's room at the top - but only just, with the eight-foot by ten-foot twin room upstairs

Equipped with a TV and iPhone docking station this en-suite room has just enough space to swing a cat in - but not much more.

There is also a picture of legendary 
British comedian Ronnie Barker - not because he stayed there but because
the owner of the hotel is a huge fan.

Owner Leif Thingtved explained how 
the quirky little hotel located in the city's trendy Stronget district 
may be small but is booked out from August to September.

'This is certainly the hottest spot in Copenhagen,' he said.

'No matter how much you pay for a room you don't really want to sit inside it all night - you want to go out.

The en-suite bathroom has been cleverly tucked into a corner of the room, which only opened for business in June but has already welcomed a stream of curious visitors

Mr Thingtved, who also runs the coffee shop downstairs, says the building is a 'little crazy but looking good'

The owners are great fans of Ronnie Barker, whose picture hangs inside the hotel in Copenhagen's trendy Stronget district

'The double bed is a Swedish design known as Hestens and the duvet is a Geismar; it's made of goose feathers.'

The historically decorated room has a
mixture of finely-polished wooden beams and furniture, retro bedside 
lamps and a padded door for extra sound-proofing.

According to Leif, the small iPhone 
dock, complete with iPhone and the TV tucked away behind a pull-down 
wooden panel adds modernity to the room, as does the urban view from the
window of the street below.

From 1905 until the Second World War, the building was a shoe repairer's with the first floor added in 1920.

It was then a goldsmith's and cafe before being empty for two years until the present owners took over.

Despite its diminutive appearance from the outside the room comes with bathroom, flat screen and mini bar

The historic building began life as a shoe repairer's in 1905 with the upper story added on in 1920

The cafe downstairs is similarly miniature with space for only five indoor seats, but it does not seem to put the customers off

Leif has owned the building and has run the coffee shop downstairs since 2010.

'It was always part of the plan to have a hotel room upstairs,' he said.

'We opened back in June and August is already fully booked.

'This building is little crazy but it's looking good.'
