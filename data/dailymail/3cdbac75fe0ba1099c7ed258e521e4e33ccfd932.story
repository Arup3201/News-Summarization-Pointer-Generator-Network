Rare bank notes once deemed worthless are set to sell for a staggering $5.7 million after they were found in a U.S. bankers' drawer.

The notes, which date back to the 1880s and total $3,500 in the old money, are now tipped to sell at auction for 1,700 times their face value.

They have miraculously survived the 130 years in mint condition and one is among the first ever bank notes to be printed in the U.S. and one of only two left in the world.

Mint condition: The rare bank notes, which include this $500 gold certificate, are set to fetch 1,700 times their face value when they sell at auction after they were found in a U.S. banker's drawer in perfect condition

The currency includes three $1,000 notes and one $500 note. The rarest of the collection is an 1882 $500 gold certificate, among the first ever bank notes printed in America and expected to fetch $2.4 million alone.

The two 1882 $1,000 gold certificates and an 1890 $1,000 treasury note are estimated to sell for $1.07 million each.

Gold certificates were initially issued by banks as proof of a deposit of gold bullion in their vaults but went on to become forms of money in their own right.

They circulated as money until 1933 
when the U.S. government banned private gold ownership and withdrew the 
certificates from circulation, making them worthless.

Incredibly, from that point on it was illegal to own gold certificates until 1964 when the government lifted its ban.

Once considered worthless: This $1,000 treasury note made in 1890 is tipped to sell for $1.07 million, as are two 1882 $1,000 gold certificates

As good as gold: Gold certificates such as this one were issued by banks as proof of deposit of gold bullion in their vaults but went on to become forms of money in their own right

In the late 1800s $3,500 was equivalent to about $80,000 in today's money.

Dustin Johnston, director of rare currency at Heritage Auctions, said: ‘This 1882 $500 gold certificate is one of the earliest gold certificates printed.

‘They were very strictly controlled and were printed in very low quantities so survivors are few and far between.

‘The only other one in the world is in the Smithsonian museum as part of the Federal Reserve collection.

‘It is so historically valuable that I would say it is one of the top 10 greatest currency notes of all time.

‘Amazingly it has come from the estate of a deceased turn-of-the-century US banker along with three very scarce $1,000 notes.

Trophy find: This 1882 $500 gold certificate is the rarest of the collection, among the first ever bank notes ever printed in the U.S. - one of only two in the world

‘It is very interesting that they were kept for that long. In 1933 when Franklin Roosevelt outlawed the possession of gold to combat the depression he also demonetized gold certificates. It was the first time the US had taken currency and made it worthless. 

‘It had to have been a complete oversight of the banker that owned these notes to sit on them during the recession.

‘$3,500 was a tremendous amount money back - the average salary was about $2,500.

‘We can only guess the banker forgot about the notes because they were only discovered much later by the banker's family in a drawer.

‘It is an absolute trophy find. Maybe once in a generation a note of this magnitude shows up - and four turned up all at once.

‘The odds of survival are so low we didn't ever expect to see these notes again - we thought they were gone for good.

‘These notes are so sought after they could well go beyond our estimates.’

The notes will be sold at the auction in Orlando, Florida, on January 10.
