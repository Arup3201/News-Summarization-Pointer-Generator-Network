An endangered Siberian tiger released into the wild by Vladimir Putin has continued its killing spree, feasting on a pet dog.

Kuzya was filmed devouring the hound for two hours on Heixiazi island, which sits on the Amur river between Russia and China.

The beast, who has also killed a flock of chickens on its rampage across north-east China, is now believed to have returned to Russia.

It's a cat eat dog world: Kuzya the tiger, released into the wild by Vladimir Putin, has continued its killing spree in China, eating a pet dog

The endangered Siberian tiger was one of three cubs released into the wild by Putin in the summer, but while two have stayed in Russia, Kuzya defected to China earlier this year

Kuzya, seen wearing a GPS tracking device, attacked and killed the pet dog in the early hours of Wednesday, China Central Television reported.

The endangered Siberian tiger was one of three cubs released into the wild by Putin in the summer, but while one stayed in Russia, Kuzya and another defected to China earlier this year.

Satellite tracking showed the rare Amur cat swam across a river - evidently in search of a Chinese meal after a shortage of its staple of deer in eastern Russia.

In October Kuzya, who is 21 months old, attacked a hen house in northern China, eating five chickens and infuriating farmers. 

Animal remains were found near the tiger's tracks, and feathers and blood near a smashed hen house.

The big cat was spotted again in Taipinggou nature reserve in Heilongjiang province and some 60 cameras have been set up in a bid to track him.

The Russians alerted Beijing through diplomatic channels amid fears angry farmers might shoot the tiger. 

Chen Zhigang, the nature reserve director, said a Russian expert had informed him of Kuzya's location and had 'expressed hope that we can protect it'.

Last month another of the tigers, Ustin, followed Kuzya into China, killing two goats, with another three going missing.

The dead goats' skulls had been crushed with puncture holes 'the size of a human finger clearly visible', a witness said. 

A wildlife protection expert has warned people not to throw food at the tiger if spotted. 

Mr Putin was praised by Russian media for saving a television crew from an attack by a Siberian tiger back in 2008.

The Russian president apparently saved the crew while on a trip to a national park to see how researchers monitor the tigers in the wild.

Just as he was arriving with a group of wildlife specialists to see a trapped Amur tiger, it escaped and ran towards a nearby camera crew, the country's main television station said.

Mr Putin quickly shot the beast and sedated it with a tranquilizer gun. 

Despite the attacks, the foreign ministry in Beijing pledged that Putin's tiger would be protected, citing an existing agreement on cross-border protection of Siberian tigers.

'We will make joint efforts with the Russian side to protect wild Siberian tigers which travel back and forth between China and Russia,' spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement.

Earlier Russian ecologists expressed fears for the animal in China.

Vasiliy Gorobeiko, deputy head of natural resources management in the Jewish Automomous Oblast republic in eastern Russia - where the tiger was roaming before he crossed the border - said China was more populated and he could be shot for worrying farm animals.

'Certainly, China will be informed about President Putin's tiger via Foreign Affairs ministry channels but time is needed for this information to reach local ecologists, and before then the tiger may well alarm the local villagers and may even suffer,' he said at the time.

'Kuzya knows how to avoid people and did so well in Russia but in that agricultural area of China, it will be hard for him.' 

The Siberian tiger, also known as Amur tiger, is on the Red List of Threatened Species.

In 2010, Russia launched a national strategy to protect the Siberian tiger, the largest of the five tiger species. According to World Wildlife Fund, just 450 Siberian tigers are left on the planet.
