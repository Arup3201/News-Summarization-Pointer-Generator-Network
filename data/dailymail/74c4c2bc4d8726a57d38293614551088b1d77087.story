As a country, Australia is used to dealing with huge fires wreaking devastation across its communities.

So you can only imagine how Sydney residents felt when they woke one morning to see this image across the city.

With billowing smoke and a bright orange glow behind skyscrapers, the city looks like it is in the grip of an enormous fire.

Scary: At first glance, this looks like Sydney could be in the grip of a huge fire

However, thankfully, rather than being a huge blaze, it was actually an early morning sunrise.

As the bright sunlight rose high above
the city it shone directly into a blanket of thick fog causing it to 
glow a deep shade of orange.

But
with the fog rapidly moving across the skyline it created the 
illusion that a fire was raging through Sydney - prompting panic among 
people awake early enough to witness the stunning sight.

Keen photographer Rob Karlen, 23, snapped these incredible images from the balcony of his apartment in the Sydney central business district after realising he was in no danger.

Mr Karlen, a student at the University of New South Wales, said: 'I took these images at about 7am - it was just as the sun was beginning to break and start making its way up the buildings.

Good news: However, instead of being a fire, it was actually a bright early morning sunrise which shone directly into a blanket of thick fog

'I was working at my computer when I saw this out of the corner of my eye through the blinds of my window.

'Immediately I thought it was a fire, so I jumped out of my seat and rushed to the balcony to figure out what was going on.

'The sky was like that for about 10 minutes until the sun got to a point where it wasn't making the fog orange in that way.

'There have been a few days of heavy fog recently but I've never seen anything that looked like that - I was genuinely worried one of the high-rise buildings was on fire it was crazy.'
