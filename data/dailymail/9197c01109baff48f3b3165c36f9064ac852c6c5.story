Much of Europe has been plunged underwater as huge downpours hit the continent.

Hundreds have been evacuated from homes in Pisa, Italy, as the city’s Arno river looks set to break its banks, and in Venice, tourists could only look on in flooded St Mark's Square as it was enveloped in a yearly phenomenon known as 'acqua alta' 
(high water).

A third of Venice is already under water as an unrelenting wave of rain sweeps across Italy.
