They say that every little helps.

But supermarket fashion brand F&F has called in help from some BIG names to help launch its sexy summer collection.

Victoria’s Secret model Amy Hixson and Tom Ford hunk Jon K feature in the new TV advertisement and print campaign shot in sizzling hot Miami.

Jon K has shot seven Tom Ford campaigns back to back and regularly tops 
international best-dressed and most handsome men lists. He has also 
previously modelled for Armani and Karl Lagerfeld.

campaigns.

With titles such as Spanish GQ Man Of The Year, German GQ Man of the Year, Mexico Maire Claire Best Dressed Of The Year, Glamour Man Of The Year and Spanish Elle’s Best International Top Model of the Year - Jon K is at the top of his game.

And Models1 beauty Amy Hixson isn't short of fashion credentials herself, with campaigns for Diesel and Victoria's Secret already under her belt.

The F&F High Summer TV 
advert launches today nationwide with a brand new collection that 
marks a new era for the label, with its most dynamic and stylish line to
date.

With head-to-toe looks from day to 
evening wear, the range aims to change perceptions of budget fashions 
with a real focus on quality, fabrics and real fashion kudos at 
affordable price-points.

The collection was influenced by the catwalk trends
that 'inspired people the most'.

'The driving factor when designing the collections has been to not compromise on quality for budget,' said a spokesperson.

Amy wears a Jewel Print Vest Top, £10, which would also look great with denim hot pants, while Jon models a Music Saved My Life T Shirt £6 and Shorts £12

Amy wears the Striped Pocket T Shirt £5 and Skinny Jeans £14 - in both lemon and lilac
