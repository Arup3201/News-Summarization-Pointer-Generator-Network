Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has told how he is determined to fight for his life after being hospitalised with a 'deteriorating' condition.

The 83-year-old statesman did not disclose the exact details of his illness but is known to suffer from an acute form of diabetes, for which he has previously sought treatment in Germany.

However, Gorbachev, who is credited with bringing openness and reform to the Soviet Union - leading ultimately to its downfall - did not say where he is currently hospitalised.

Illness: Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev said he is 'fighting for his life' as he battles a 'deteriorating' condition in hospital

He said: 'In the last seven days my condition was more or less well, but today I am in hospital.

'There has been a deterioration. I am lying under monitors, wires all over me.'

He stressed: 'You know my character. It's focused on fighting, on life.'

Gorbachev was president of the Soviet Union between 1985 and 1991 and is widely respected around the world for ending the Cold War. 

During his years in the Kremlin, he forged closer ties with the West, building relationships with both Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.

The Nobel Peace laureate expressed annoyance that he could not follow this week's Nobel awards properly due to his illness. 

Last month he warned Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama not to let their mutual animosity deepen the current crisis over Ukraine.

'It is spoken that the current radicalisation is mainly a result of the personal relations between presidents Putin and Obama which are 'not shaping well',' said Gorbachev at the time.

'To me such a way of thinking is a huge mistake.

'We do not choose our partners and if our relations do not 'shape', we have a duty as leaders, a responsibility for our citizens and the whole world, and we should step over personal matters and stand for the interests of our nations.'

He warned that 'for the sake of peace in Ukraine, in Europe and in the whole world, it is essential to resume the dialogue between Russia and the USA.'

This was 'their role and responsibility' and they must set aside differences and start talking.

'It is inevitable if we do not want to kill the world where all of us now live. '

Loggerheads: Mr Gorbachev has been openly critical of current Russian leader Vladimir Putin

Mikhail Gorbachev took over the Kremlin in 1985 and began the process of economic and political reforms which ingrained the terms perestroika and glasnost on the western consciousness.

In 1984 the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously said of him: 'I like Mr Gorbachev, we can do business together'.

He stepped down on Christmas Day 1991 handing over control to Boris Yeltsin and declaring the office of President of the Soviet Union dead.

The Soviet Union was formally dissolved the following day.

Popular in the West for the role he played in ending the Cold War, Gorbachev is disliked by many at home for the collapse of the Soviet Union and the years of turmoil that followed it.

Gorbachev was intially supportive of current Russian leader Vladmir Putin praising him for bringing stability and economic reform to the country.

But in recent years he has become openly critical of Putin's policies, warning that the lack of political competition, flawed elections and rampant corruption have stymied Russia's development.

Earlier this year a group of Russian MPs made an extraordinary bid to have Gorbachev prosecuted for the 'illegal' collapse of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago.

One MP in Vladimir Putin's United Russia Party even branded 83-year-old Gorbachev a 'US spy' for the break-up of the Communist state 23 years ago.

Gorbachev called the MPs' move 'sheer stupidity', adding: 'These people just do not have shame.'
