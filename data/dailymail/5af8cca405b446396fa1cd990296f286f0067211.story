The Fifty Shades of Grey series of erotic novels are the favorite reading material among former CIA captives being held at the notorious Guantanamo detention camp, it has emerged.

U.S. congressman Jim Moran made the revelation after touring Camp 7, the top-security facility that holds more than a dozen 'high-value' prisoners.

The Democratic Representative of Virginia said the bestselling book by British author E. L. James was the most requested book - even beating the Koran.

As reported by the Huffington Post, Mr Moran, who visited the Cuban camp last week, said: 'Rather than the Koran, the book that is requested most by the (detainees) is 'Fifty Shades of Grey.'

'They've read the entire series in English, but we were willing to translate it.

'I guess there's not much going on, these guys are going nowhere, so what the hell.'

Mr Moran, who favours shutting down the detention camp on the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base in Cuba, said he learned about the book's popularity while touring Camp 7 - which holds five men charged with plotting the September 11 attacks in 2001.

A military spokesman said he could not 
discuss details of Camp 7, whose inmates were held in secret CIA prisons
 before being sent to Guantanamo in 2006.

'We don't discuss our high-value detainees except in the most generic terms. Further, we do not discuss the assertions made by members of Congress,' said Lieutenant Colonel Samuel House, a spokesman for the prison camp.

Some prisoners are taking part in a hunger strike to protest their indefinite detention.

Journalists are not allowed to visit that part of the detention camp but can tour the other prisons and the library that provides books, magazines and DVDs to all 166 captives.

During a visit last week, Reuters saw an eclectic mix of books in numerous languages, from religious tomes to Star Trek novelizations, Agatha Christie mysteries, stress reduction workbooks and the Greek classic 'The Odyssey'.

Also on offer is 'The Hunger Games,' according to a librarian who goes by the nickname Zorro. 'We have the movie and the book too,' he said.

Guantanamo librarians have said in the past that they screen reading material for sexual content, even blacking out photos of scantily clad women in the advertisements in sports magazines.

Fifty Shades of Grey is a 2011 erotic romance novel and is the first installment in the Fifty Shades trilogy.

It traces the deepening relationship between a college graduate, Anastasia Steele, and a young business magnate, Christian Grey.

The book gained much publicity because of its explicitly erotic scenes.

The series has topped best-seller lists around the world and sold more than 70 million copies worldwide.
