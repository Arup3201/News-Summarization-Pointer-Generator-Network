When deciding to get married, it is important to focus on the question and never to make a snap decision.

But that's exactly what Jerrit Pruyn did when he proposed to girlfriend Cara... by writing 'Marry Me' on the lens of his camera and asking her to take his picture.

The professional photographer, from New York, took her to a vineyard in nearby Long Island under the guise of taking some romantic shots.

But little did she know quite how romantic they would turn out to be.

'Marry Me': Here's what Cara saw the moment Jerrit dropped to one knee

Tears of joy: He said they were 'both in bits' after she said yes but managed to take this picture

'I knew I wanted something intimate, original, unique and true to who we are,' Pruyn wrote on his blog. 'I had the idea to use a vintage camera and tripod as part of the proposal. Then the experimenting began to find the best way to incorporate this.'

Not wanting to ruin the lens of his vintage Nikkormat SLR with ink, he needed a plan.

So finally he came up with the idea of writing the words - backwards and upside down so they would appear the right way up when Cara peered through the viewfinder - on an iPhone screen protector which he duly placed on the camera's glass.

'Decor piece': Jerrit used his vintage Nikkormat SLR for the proposal, which the couple are having engraved with the date and location to serve as a 'decor piece' in their home

Yes! Jerrit says Cara didn't believe him at first but agreed through tears of joy

When the day finally arrived, they packed the car and drove to Duck Walk Vineyards with a bottle of wine and a picnic and went for a walk.

He then suggested they take a picture together and set up the camera to face the vines.

'After setting everything up I pocketed the ring and went in front of the camera,' he wrote. 'I asked Cara to focus the camera on me so we could take a photo together.

The ring: The 1920's single diamond filigree engagement ring. Purchased in Cara¿s college town of Ann Arbor, MI.

'I dropped to one knee and pulled the ring out as she looked through the camera. After many "Oh my Gods" and "is this for real?s", she accepted. She was more excited than I had imagined.'

'We are going to have the camera engraved with the date and location, and it will always be a decor piece in our home.'

The proposal comes a day after it was revealed gadget fan Breon Nagy, from Minnesota, became  the first in the person in the world to propose to his girlfriend through smart headset Google Glass.

He used the wearable computing device to record the memorable occasion earlier this month and then posted the video, shot at Britain's Leeds Castle in Kent, on YouTube.
