Aston Villa

Christian Benteke will return to the Aston Villa squad for their crucial relegation battle at Sunderland.

The striker missed the FA Cup quarter final win over West Brom with a hip injury but boss Tim Sherwood confirmed he will travel to the Stadium of Light.

Ron Vlaar (calf) will be assessed and Kieran Richardson (calf) is a doubt while Aly Cissokho (groin) is a likely absentee and Philippe Senderos (calf), Joe Cole (hamstring), Nathan Baker (knee), Alan Hutton and Jack Grealish (both suspended) are out. Libor Kozak has returned to full training after more than a year out with a broken leg but is not yet match fit.

Provisional squad: Guzan, Given, Vlaar, Lowton, Clark, Okore, Kinsella, Richardson, N'Zogbia, Bacuna, Westwood, Delph, Sanchez, Cleverley, Gil, Sinclair, Weimann, Agbonlahor, Benteke.
