Was it all part of Louis van Gaal’s master plan to relax the Spaniards to the point of complacency?

If so, it certainly worked.

For just moments before Holland’s World Cup opener against the world champions, Van Gaal was captured embracing and casually chatting to his opponents.

The Dutch boss distracted his former Barcelona playrmaker Xavi as well as defender Gerard Pique, chatting with the pair in the tunnel before kick-off.

And the laid-back approach extended to Spain’s performance on the pitch as Van Gaal’s men stormed to an emphatic 5-1 victory.

Robin van Persie (2), Arjen Robben (2) and Stefan De Vrij were on target in Salvador to send Oranje to the top of Group B.
