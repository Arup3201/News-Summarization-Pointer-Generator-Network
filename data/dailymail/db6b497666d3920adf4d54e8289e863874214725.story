Case: The jury at Mark Duggan's inquest will hear evidence from a witness who claims she saw police plant a gun at the scene of his death

A judge took the highly unusual step of leading his court in a moment’s silence to commemorate Mark Duggan, the alleged gangster whose death sparked the 2011 riots which scarred Britain.

Judge Keith Cutler, sitting at Duggan’s inquest, asked everyone inside the courtroom to fall silent and to acknowledge the ‘regrettable loss of a young life’.

Later the inquest heard Duggan was a member of one of Britain’s most notorious gangs and was shot by a police marksman who believed the suspect was about to fire a revolver in a crowded street.

Judge Cutler, sitting as a coroner at the High Court, led the 20-second silence by lowering his head and clasping his hands together.

Addressing the jury, he said: ‘It is right that you should know that present in court today are a number of Mark Duggan’s family and friends and to acknowledge the grief of those family and friends and to respect that loss we will together just have some moments of silence as we sit here to recognise the seriousness of the hearing for which we are about to undertake.’

The request for a moment’s silence was understood to have been made by Duggan’s family and supporters.

Inquests, by their nature, involve the passing of a loved one, but are not generally used to commemorate someone’s death.

The decision to hold a period of silence at the start of an inquest is virtually unprecedented.

The inquest heard yesterday how Duggan
was shot twice by a police marksman after the officer saw him raise a 
gun wrapped in a sock towards him.

One
bullet hit the 29-year-old in his right bicep and the other hit him in 
the chest, which killed him ‘in 10 heartbeats’, it was said.

Judge Keith Cutler asked everyone inside the courtroom to fall silent and to acknowledge the 'regrettable loss of a young life'

Moments
before he was killed, the taxi in which he was travelling was stopped 
by armed police during the evening rush-hour in Tottenham, north London,
on August 4, 2011.

The 
father-of-four, who had taken the party drug Ecstasy, then ran out of 
the Toyota minicab holding the gun, the court was told.

The
firearms officer, known only by his codename of V53, opened fire in 
‘self-defence’ because he thought Duggan posed a ‘lethal threat’.

When
officers looked for the gun they thought he was holding they found it 
up to 20 feet away on the other side of a wall from where he was killed,
the inquest heard.

Counsel 
for the inquest Ashley Underwood, QC, said armed officers tried to shock
Duggan ‘into submission’ by performing a ‘hard stop’ on the taxi by 
blocking it with three unmarked police cars.

Addressing
the jury, he said: ‘Regrettably you will hear it didn’t work, in the 
sense that Mr Duggan wasn’t shocked into submission,’ he said.

‘He
got out of the minicab and he ran. You will also hear, of course, from 
V53 that he was running with a gun in his hand and he started to bring 
that gun up into the aim (position).

Evidence: Photograph shows the bullet-holed jacket worn by Mark Duggan on the night he was shot

CCTV captured the taxi in which the father-of-four was travelling when it was stopped by armed police. The jury visited the scene yesterday

‘That
police officer will tell you that the reason he fired was because he 
saw what he believed to be a gun wrapped in a sock in Mr Duggan’s hand 
and that he was presenting it in a way that was threatening and that he 
fired in self-defence.

‘One of the shots hit Mr Duggan on the inside of his right bicep, but didn’t do very much damage.

‘The
second went through his chest and came out his back going through his 
aorta, the main artery which pumps blood into the heart, and was fatal.’
Less than half an hour before the shooting Duggan had allegedly picked 
up a gun from Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, who has since been jailed for 
supplying it to him.

Detectives
had set up a covert surveillance operation on Duggan and five other 
suspects because they believed they were members of the notorious 
Tottenham Mandem gang.

The 
criminal network has been linked to dozens of murders since its members 
started drugs trafficking on the notorious Broadwater Farm Estate in 
Tottenham from the mid-1980s.

Mr Underwood said Scotland Yard had set up Operation Dibri to thwart the illegal activities of the TMD gang.

‘They
were concentrating on a gang based in Tottenham called for short TMD 
and they believed that Mr Duggan was a gang member and was going to pick
up a gun from a man called Kev or Kevin,’ he said.

He
also told the jury that Duggan and Hutchinson-Foster appeared to speak 
on the phone several times before the gun was allegedly handed over.

Mr
Underwood told the jury that they will need to decide if Duggan was 
holding gun when he was shot, if it was necessary for the marksman to 
fire twice and if the police operation was planned and implemented in a 
way that minimised lethal force.

The inquest, which is expected to last two months, continues.
