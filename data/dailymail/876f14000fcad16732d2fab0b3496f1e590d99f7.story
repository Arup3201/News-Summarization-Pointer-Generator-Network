Aston Villa have sounded out Rio Ferdinand over a possible move to Villa Park.

However, the 35-year-old free agent is understood to be reluctant to make the move to the Midlands and is weighing up options in London where he has re-located his family, with QPR, Crystal Palace and West Ham showing initial interest.

Ferdinand was spotted in Alderley Edge in Cheshire on Friday enjoying some lunch and shopping.

Not for me: Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has turned down a move to Aston Villa

Villa signed Philippe Senderos on Thursday to add experience to their squad but are looking at other bargain deals also.

Ferdinand,
 who had considered retiring to take up more television work, is ready 
for one last crack at the Premier League after an inauspicious final 
season at Old Trafford with Manchester United.

Tottenham
 have also been credited with an interest and they would be Ferdinand's 
preferred choice but Mauricio Pochettino is still weighing up his squad 
before making any decisions.

Galtasaray and LA Galaxy are also interested in Ferdinand.
