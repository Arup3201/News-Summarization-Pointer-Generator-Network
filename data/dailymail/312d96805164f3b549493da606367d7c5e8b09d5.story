Four workers in the Pennsylvania attorney general's office have been fired after receiving and distributing pornographic emails.

The staffers have not yet been named, and Attorney General Kathleen Kane would not comment except to say a statement on internal disciplinary action would be released in the next few days.

This comes just one week after Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Seamus McCaffery took early retirement after it was disclosed he had sent or received 234 emails with sexually explicit content or pornography from late 2008 to May 2012.

ABC 27 reports that in addition to the firings, five staffers stepped down after Kane released their names in relation to this porn scandal, which was discovered during an internal investigation of the Jerry Sandusky prosecution.

The Attorney General at that time was Tom Corbett.

Among those who resigned were Environmental Protection Secretary Christopher Abruzzo, DEP deputy chief counsel Glenn Parno, and Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole member Randy Feathers. 

Retired: One of those workers was Just Seamus McCaffrey (above) who took a sudden retirement last week 

As a result of Justice McCaffrey's retirement, the Judicial Conduct Board said it would end its investigation as the most serious sanctions possible were his removal from office and a prohibition against him holding future judicial office.

McCaffery's wife, Lise Rapaport, also retired at the same time as her husband and just as suddenly from her $84,000-a-year job as his chief administrative assistant.
