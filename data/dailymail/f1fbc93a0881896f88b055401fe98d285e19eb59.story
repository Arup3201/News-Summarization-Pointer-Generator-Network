It's a touching tribute that was put together by a complete stranger.

But a video that collates the final Tweets of a girl purportedly dying of terminal brain cancer - posting on her social media site right up until her death - has been the cause of plenty tears this weekend.

While there remains some debate over the authenticity of the Tweets and the possibility the account is a hoax, the ever-increasing amount of viewers don't seem to care based on the message the clip is leaving with people.

There is no last name attached to the Twitter handle of 'Amanda' (@TrappedAtMyDesk), which chronicles the musings of a young woman who moves to Ottawa, Canada, works for the government, discovers she's sick and then dies from her illness.

However the four-minute video - which brings together a snapshot of Amanda's final five months - is showing people how short life is and what we might take for granted.

Touching: Twitter user 'Amanda' (left) documented the last few months of her life on her social media site after discovering she had a brain tumor. Blogger and mom Shannon McKarney (right) gathered all the Tweets together and made a video of them as a tribute to Amanda's life and a reminder of our own

And, with many noticing that Amanda's death is dated April 2013, it's a stark reminder of the need to pay more attention to those around us, because these haunting posts are only really being noticed now.

'That's the main thing that struck me,' said the creator of the video, blogger and stay-at-home mom Shannon McKarney stated in her blog zchamu.com.

'I never met her, but her story stayed with me.

'I kept going back and reading her tweet stream, wishing I had reached out when she was alive.

'But I missed the chance. She was gone.'

The video was initially made for a presentation for a digital strategy conference but, after recently posting it online, McKarney realized how quickly it was resonating with people.

However McKarney's attempts to verify Amanda's story have so far been unsuccessful, despite her attempts to reach out to family members and friends using her video, blog and social.

'You can’t verify anything online, but I chose to take it at face value because there’s nothing else to be done,' McKarney said.

The beginning: The tone of 'Amanda's# Twitter feed began to change in early January when she started worrying about a forthcoming doctors appointment

This is the moment Amanda finds out she has advanced glioblastoma multiforme - a brain tumor

'It is a moving story. ... I believe that she was an individual, and I believe that her life mattered.'

McKarney also said the story said alot about social media and the world we live in.

'It used to be that you would just find batches of letters in somebody’s attic, and you would read their history that way,' she said.

'Now we leave these digital traces behind us everywhere we go — tweets and Facebook posts and blog posts — and it really stayed with me that some day that may be the only way that people can get to know you and the person that you were.'

The @TrappedAtMyDesk account produced almost 170 tweets, and states that Amanda was in Ottawa, according to The Ottawa Citzen.

The feed was launched in November 2009, with: 'Figuring out twitter. How do I find more people in Ottawa?'

However early last year, everything changed.

'My doctors office just called me to come in to discuss some test results. That can only be bad, right? The (sic) don’t call unless its (sic) bad news,' the writer stated on January 14, 2013.

After finishing up her job, Amanda said she went on a trip, but had to return she when started to get sick

Final three: These are the official last Tweets on Amanda's Twitter account

By January 18, the writer referred to test results: 'advanced glioblastoma multiforme.' (brain tumor)

The next the account statedL 'Deciding what to do for the rest of my life.'

Then on January 21: 'I just resigned from my #goc (Government of Canada) job. No point when I have 3mths to live, right? I wonder if I’ll get my pension money.'

There were no tweets for a couple of months, until the writer stated in March that she’d gone travelling and returned home after she started to get sick.

On April 10, the writer stated: 'Don’t spend time being angry at people. Forgive them. Life is entirely too short.'

The last post came that day: 'Tomorrow, I go back into the hospital for the last time. Thank you all for the good vibes. Be good to each other. #quietlastnight'

The next and final tweet from the account was apparently written by someone named James on April 15.

'My dear little sister Amanda passed away from brain cancer late last night,' it says.
