A bizarre video has emerged from China of a man wearing a motorcycle helmet while driving a severely damaged lorry.

The footage was captured earlier this month when police officers stopped the man on a highway in Jiangxi Province.

He was driving with another man, who, interestingly, was not wearing any sort of safety gear - despite travelling in the same vehicle.

A bizarre video has emerged from China of a man driving a severely damaged lorry while wearing a helmet

The vehicle is so badly damaged that the cab has to be propped up with a wooden stick

The man was pulled over by police officers after the lorry was spotted on a highway in Jiangxi Province

The driver claimed that the accident had happened the night before but wanted to repair it himself at home

In the video, the man demonstrates how he has propped up the roof of the lorry’s cab using a wooden stick and that he's wearing the helmet to protect himself from strong winds while driving.

According to police reports, the driver said he had crashed the lorry the evening before and had been reluctant to pay for a recovery vehicle so decided to make the journey home to repair the damage himself.

The local news station claims that the driver was given a penalty by the police officers and his lorry was removed from the highway.
