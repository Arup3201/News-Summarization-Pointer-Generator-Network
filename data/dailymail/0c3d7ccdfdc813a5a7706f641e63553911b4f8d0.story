A somber Pope Francis steeped his Christmas message to the world in sadness for those with little cause for joy — abused children, refugees, hostages and others suffering from violence in the Middle East, Africa, Ukraine and elsewhere.

'Truly there are so many tears this Christmas, said Francis, looking solemn and smiling little, to a crowd, estimated by the Vatican to number more than 80,000 Romans, tourists and pilgrims, filled St. Peter's Square for his 'Urbi et Orbi' message (Latin for 'to the city and to the world').

Anguish for children who suffer maltreatment or violence, including in the recent terrorist attack on a Pakistani military school, tempered the pontiff's traditional Christmas Day speech, which he delivered from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica.

'I think also of those infants massacred in bomb attacks, also those where the Son of God was born,' he said, referring to the Middle East

Pope Francis condemned 'brutal' religious persecution in the Middle East while urging peace in Nigeria, Ukraine and other troubled spots

He lamented that many children are 'made objects of trade and trafficking' or forced to become soldiers, as well as those never born because of abortion.

'I think also of those infants massacred in bomb attacks, also those where the Son of God was born,' he said, referring to the Middle East.

The Pope also decried the persecution of ancient Christian communities in Iraq and Syria, along with those from other ethnic and religious groups.

'May Christmas bring them hope,' he said.

Referring to refugees and exiles, he prayed: 'May indifference be changed into closeness, and rejection into hospitality.' He expressed hope they'd receive humanitarian help to withstand the 'rigors of winter, return to their countries and live with dignity.'

The pope also thanked those courageously helping people infected with Ebola in Africa.

In his litany of the world's troubled places, he denounced hostage-taking in Nigeria, and hoped that reconciliation would prevail over 'hatred and violence' in Ukraine, where pro-Russian rebels have been fighting against government forces in the east of that country.

While much of his message concerned poor countries, Francis had harsh words for some in affluent nations. He prayed for an end to the hardened hearts 'of so many men and women immersed in worldliness and indifference, the globalization of indifference.'

'Truly there are so many tears this Christmas,' said Francis, looking solemn and smiling little, in contrast to his often jocular demeanor when addressing crowds

A crowd, estimated by the Vatican to number more than 80,000 Romans, tourists and pilgrims, filled St. Peter's Square to hear the speech

'I think also of those infants massacred in bomb attacks, also those where the Son of God was born,' he said, referring to the Middle East

Christmas joy will only be realized when weapons are transformed 'into ploughshares, destruction into creativity, hatred into love and tenderness,' Francis concluded before giving the crowd his blessing.

Pope Francis celebrated Christmas Eve with a late-night Mass in St Peter's Basilica after making a phone call to refugees in Iraq who have been forced to flee their homes by ISIS.

In the phone call, the Pontiff told refugees at the tent camp in Ankawa, northern Iraq, that they too were like Jesus and were forced to flee because there was no place for them.

His call of Christmas greetings came as the Vatican prepared to host the Mass, with the Pope already unveiling a statue of the baby Jesus in a nativity scene.

Before the ceremony, the Pope called Iraqi refugees forced out of their homes by Muslim militants to pass on his Christmas greetings

Earlier this week, the Pope had written a Christmas letter to the Christians of the Middle East expressing his closeness to them 

The Pope told the refugees: 'You're like Jesus on this night, and I bless you and am close to you.

'I embrace you all and wish for you a holy Christmas.'

The Ankawa camp houses mostly Christian refugees forced to flee the onslaught by militants of ISIS. 

In a letter to Middle East Christians penned earlier this week, Francis urged them to remain in the region, where Christian communities have existed for 2,000 years, and to help their fellow Muslim citizens present 'a more authentic image of Islam' as a religion of peace.

The Mass came just days after Francis excoriated the Vatican bureaucracy for a laundry list of sins, including lusting for power and suffering from 'spiritual Alzheimer's'

During the Mass hours later in St Peter's, Francis echoed some of the themes he raised in the phone call as he reflected on the Nativity scene.

'How much the world needs tenderness today!' he said. 'God's patience, God's closeness, God's tenderness.' 

In his homily, the Pope, wearing white vestments, said Christmas is a time to remember that God's message of peace 'is stronger than darkness and corruption'.

He said: 'The question put to us simply by the infant's presence is, 'Do I allow God to love me?' Do we have the courage to welcome with tenderness the difficulties and problems of those who are near to us?' 

It is the second Christmas season for Pope Francis as leader of the Roman Catholic Church and being elected last year.

The Mass marked the start of a busy few weeks for the 78-year-old that includes New Year's Eve vespers and 2015 greetings a few hours later.

On January 6 he will celebrate Epiphany Mass, and on January 11 he will baptise babies in the Sistine Chapel.

A day later he gives his annual foreign policy address to diplomats before boarding a plane for a week-long trip to Sri Lanka and the Philippines.

Today he focused his concern on those weeping in the world this Christmas, singling out refugees, hostages and others suffering in the Middle East, Africa and Ukraine as he prayed for hope and peace during his traditional Christmas Day message.

Anguish for children who are victims of violence, including in the recent terrorist attack on a Pakistani military school, tempered the pontiff's speech, which he delivered from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica. 

Tens of thousands of Romans and tourists crowded into St. Peter's Square to hear Francis deliver the 'Urbi et Orbi' message - Latin for 'to the city and to the world'.

The service in the Vatican came just days after Francis excoriated the Vatican bureaucracy for a laundry list of sins, including lusting for power and suffering from 'spiritual Alzheimer's'.

Many of the same cardinals, bishops and priests who received the dressing down were on hand in St Peter's Basilica for the Mass.

Several have spoken out in recent days saying Francis was merely asking them to examine their consciences, as any Jesuit spiritual director would do, and to use the Christmas season to heal.

Meanwhile, thousands of pilgrims also flocked to Bethlehem to travel to the Church of the Nativity for traditional Christmas Eve celebrations. 

On a crisp sunny day, revellers crowded into Manger Square, stopping in restaurants and admiring the Christmas tree in the town, where Jesus is believed to have been born.

Scout troops could be heard playing bagpipes, horns and drums, while street traders sold Santa hats and special sesame sweets for children.

The celebrations brought a boost to the area after a difficult year, which saw Israel battle Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip during a 50-day war over the summer.

The Church of the Nativity, built over the grotto that Christians believe is the site of Jesus' birth, was flanked by a towering Christmas tree and a large poster in Arabic and English that read 'All I want for Christmas is justice.'
