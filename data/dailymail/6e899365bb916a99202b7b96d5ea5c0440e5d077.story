Benetton has become the latest global retailer to agree to sign a one-of-a-kind pact to improve safety at Bangladesh factories following a building collapse that killed more than 1,100 workers in the country last month.

The move, announced by Benetton today, comes after H&M, a trendy Swedish fashion chain that is the largest clothing buyer in Bangladesh, said Monday that it would sign the same five-year legally binding factory safety contract.

Within hours, C&A of the Netherlands, British retailers Tesco and Primark, and Spain's Inditex, owner of Zara, followed.

The announcements come ahead of a Wednesday deadline imposed by worker rights groups that said they would increase pressure on brands that did not sign the agreement.

'We decided to support this agreement so that our group can be at the forefront of contributing to a significant and lasting improvement in working conditions and safety in Bangladesh,' Biaglo Chiarolanza, CEO of Benetton Group SpA, said in a statement.

The agreement requires that the companies conduct independent safety inspections, make their reports on factory conditions public and cover the costs for needed repairs.

It also calls for them to pay up to $500,000 annually toward the effort, to stop doing business with any factory that refuses to make safety upgrades and to allow workers and their unions to have a voice in factory safety.

The six companies that agreed to the pact join two other retailers that signed the contract last year: PVH, which makes clothes under the Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Izod labels, and German retailer Tchibo.

The agreement has since been expanded to five years from two.

Among the holdouts, Wal-Mart, the second-largest clothing buyer in Bangladesh, said through spokesman Kevin Gardner on Monday that it had nothing to announce. And Gap, which had been close to signing the agreement last year, said late Monday that the pact is 'within reach,' but the company is concerned about the possible legal liability involved.

Labor groups applauded the retailers that agreed to the pact. They say the agreement goes a long way toward improving working conditions in Bangladesh's garment industry, which long has been known to be dangerous.

Trauma: Doctors say she has had trouble sleeping and panic attacks

The agreement comes as the working conditions of Bangladesh's garment industry have come under increased scrutiny. Since 2005, at least 1,800 workers have been killed in the Bangladeshi garment industry in factory fires and building collapses, according to research by the advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.

The two latest tragedies in the country's garment industry have raised alarm. The building collapse at Rana Plaza on April 24 was the industry's worst disaster in history. And it came months after a fire in another garment factory in Bangladesh in November killed 112 workers.

Following the latest tragedy, Walt Disney Co. announced that it is stopping production of its branded goods in Bangladesh. But most retailers have vowed to stay and promised to work for change. H&M and Wal-Mart both have said they have no plans to leave.

Other big chains such as The Children's Place, Mango, J.C. Penney, Gap, Benetton and Sears have said the same.

But the pressure has increased for those that stay. Since April's building collapse, Avaaz, a human rights group with 21 million members worldwide, has gotten more than 900,000 signatures on a petition pushing Gap and H&M to commit to the proposal.

The safety agreement comes two years after a fire and safety proposal drawn up by labor unions was first rejected by many clothing companies as too costly and legally binding. The latest agreement is a revised version of that proposed pact.

Forty companies, including Wal-Mart, H&M, and J.C. Penney, met in Germany with labor rights groups, labor unions and nongovernmental organizations days after the building collapse. They discussed how the industry could improve safety conditions in Bangladesh.

Only a few companies, including Britain's Primark and Canada's Loblaw Inc., which owns the Joe Fresh clothing line, have acknowledged that suppliers were making clothes for them at the Rana Plaza site and have promised to compensate workers and their families.

Loblaw's CEO said suppliers were making clothes for as many as 30 brands and retailers at the site. Benetton labels were found at the site, and the Italian fashion brand acknowledged that one of its suppliers had used one of the factories.

The company said that before the collapse, the factory had been removed from its list of approved factories. And in the U.S., university chapters of United Students Against Sweatshops are helping to stage demonstrations against Gap in more than a dozen cities including Seattle, Los Angeles and New York.

Joy: The factory worker's rescue was shown live on national television and the crowd cheered as she was released

A woman who was rescued after 17 days 
from under the rubble of a collapsed garments factory in Bangladesh has 
told how she survived on biscuits and bottles of water.

Reshma Begum stunned her country and the world when she was pulled out of the rubble without any serious injuries.

Miss Begum, 19, said that on the day of the building’s collapse, she had rushed to work and did not have any breakfast.

Instead,
she bought four small packets of biscuits on her way into work. It was a
decision that would save her life – as she then rationed her scarce 
supply over the next two weeks.

Her rescue – which was shown live on 
national television – brought the country’s capital, Dhaka, to a 
standstill as people stopped work and gathered around TV sets.

Yesterday,
Miss Begum told hospital staff and her rescuers that she lived on the 
biscuits and bottles of water for the first 15 days – as she lay 
holed-up inside a cavity in the wreckage of the Rana Plaza building in 
the Savar area of Dhaka.

Destruction: Workers are continuing to clear the rubble at the scene of the building collapse

Bodies: Rescuers have been working to remove corpses which are decomposing quickly in the 30C heat

It
is believed the lifesaving bottles of water reached her after they were
thrown down a hole by rescue workers. The rescuers had been told to 
push the bottles down every hole and cavity they stumbled across – in 
the hope those trapped underneath would receive them.

Miss
Begum – who lived alone in a rented room in Savar – said that when the 
eight-storey building collapsed, she was on the third floor.

She
managed to run down to the second floor but became trapped in a cavity.
The cavity was big enough for her to move about in and there was enough
air to breathe.

But her hair had become stuck under a boulder, so she had to pull off strands to set herself free.

Recovering
at the Combined Military Hospital in Savar, Miss Begum said: ‘No one 
heard me. It was so frightening. I never dreamed I’d see the daylight 
again.’

The seamstress now has trouble sleeping at night, and occasionally grips a nurse’s hand in apparent panic attacks.

Colonel Azizur Rahman, a military doctor at the hospital, said: ‘We don’t want those memories to haunt her now, so we are not allowing anybody to ask her anything.

‘She is now being provided semi-liquid food.’

It has emerged that Miss Begum’s family learned that she was alive after watching the rescue on TV.

Vigil: Relatives continue to wait outside the collapsed building hoping for news of loved ones

Grief: The collapse was the country's worst industrial accident to date

Her mother Zobeida Begum, who is in her 60s, said: ‘I just could not believe it when I saw her alive in  the hospital.’

Her sister Asma said: ‘We got her back when we had just lost all hope of finding her alive.’

They said they had kept a vigil for the seamstress, who is from the rural Dinajpur district, 170 miles north of Dhaka.

Doctors said last night that Miss Begum is suffering from dehydration but will make a full recovery.

The death toll in the worst industrial accident in the country’s history has now reached 1,100 – and the government is facing criticism for not imposing better checks on buildings run by the garments industry.

Miss Begum was filmed by Somoy TV in her hospital bed, as doctors and nurses milled about, giving her saline and checking her condition.
