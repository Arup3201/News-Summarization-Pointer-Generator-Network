A planned rise in the price of petrol will go ahead as George Osborne refused to freeze or reduce the amount of tax motorists pay for fuel.

Despite pressure from hard-pressed 
motorists and businesses that rely on fuel, such as hauliers, there will
be a 3.02p per litre hike in fuel duty from August.

The move sparks fears that the country could see a repeat of fuel protests similar to those seen in September 2000 when petrol pumps ran dry during a series of rolling blockades on the country's motorway networks.

Soaring fuel costs: Petrol and diesel prices have rocketed in the last decade

Mr Osborne said: 'High oil prices have put real pressure on household budgets and on businesses.

'That is why we took action in last year's Budget to cut fuel duty so it is 6p lower than our predecessors planned.

'We
have also scrapped the last Government's fuel duty escalator of annual 
above inflation rises, regardless of the oil price - and are today 
confirming the fair fuel stabiliser.

'Above
inflation rises will only return if the oil price falls below £45 on a 
sustained basis - currently equivalent to around 75 US dollars.'

AA president Edmund King said: 'At a 
time of record prices at the pumps the August increase in duty is a 
budget blow-out which will force drivers off the road and could bring a 
summer of discontent for many.

'We have heard much about tax 
allowances but the increase in fuel duty makes no allowance for 
car-dependent, rural and disabled drivers.

'Only last week the Prime Minister 
told American students that UK fuel prices would make them ‘faint’, yet 
the Government seems intent on inflicting more pain for no gain on 
drivers.

'Ironically such a hike in duty 
doesn’t necessarily help Government finances as people will cut spending
at the pumps and in shops, and it could fuel inflation.'

Quentin Willson, national spokesman for campaign group FairFuelUK, said: 'The Government has turned its back on families and businesses all across the country - three-quarters of the electorate who want lower fuel prices.

'It ignores the threat of rising global oil prices - even the Saudis are trying to pull down the price of crude. And it ignores robust research we gave to the Prime Minister showing that cutting duty will create jobs, improve GDP and cost the Treasury absolutely nothing.'

The rise in the price of Brent oil is doing little to help motorists at the pumps

A rise in petrol prices could spark fuel protests similar to those seen in September 2000

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'The Chancellor’s decision to go ahead with the summer rise in fuel duty is as unsurprising as it will be disappointing to 34 million drivers, especially when the Chancellor acknowledges there is likely to be a further spike in oil prices.

'George Osborne said that taxes should be fair, simple, predictable and support work. Motoring tax fails on at least three of these measures and it is time for a review of exactly what fuel duty is for and who it impacts most.'

In a move aimed at appeasing hard-pressed drivers, the Chancellor also said he would increase vehicle excise duty only by inflation and it would be frozen for hauliers.

Air passengers were hit by an increase in air passenger duty along with a rise that was deferred from 2011.

It will mean a 10 per cent hike in duty adding £250 to a family of four's flights to Florida and £360 onto a flight to Australia.

Travel organisation Abta said the APD news was 'incredibly disappointing' but added that the South East airport announcement was 'encouraging'.

Some motorists had said they 
would have to change or quit their jobs as a result of the rise in duty 
because of unaffordable travel costs.

Of 16,647 AA members polled, 4per cent
said they would change jobs to reduce mileage while 3per cent would 
have to abandon their job because of unaffordable travel costs.

Skilled service and manual workers are most at risk, with 9per cent fearing for their employment as a result of the rise.

Southern England, the Midlands and north west England are the regions where there is most concern about jobs, the survey showed.

The cost of refilling a car has reached record levels with many people saying the cost of fuel has affected their lives

The planned increase is likely push petrol prices up to around 145p a litre, with diesel rising to 150p.

Those polled were asked what would be 
the effect of such prices, with 63per cent saying they would cut back on
car use, 18per cent would cut back on grocery shopping and 23per cent 
would abandon or delay the purchase of furniture, home improvements or 
luxury items.

AA president Edmund King said: 'Pump 
prices that many people can't afford means lost high street spending, 
higher transport costs, rising inflation, lost tax from lower fuel 
sales, lost tax from businesses going bust, lost tax from workers losing
their jobs and a bigger unemployment benefit bill.

'A hike in fuel costs at the start of the holiday season will backfire as many people are already cutting back.'

There were hopes that George Osborne would repeat his U-turn during the Autumn budget in which he abandoned a planned rise in fuel duty in January

Driving groups had hoped for a repeat of the 
Autumn Statement in November when Mr Osborne pulled a U-turn and axed a 
planned hike this January.

He also lowered the original duty rise to the 3.02p figure from 5p.

Over 90 per cent of businesses and 
motorists think the Government should cut fuel duty in the Budget, 
according to a poll by MoneySupermarket.

In the same poll, over 40 per cent 
believed prices are far too high and another 38 per cent believe cutting
the fuel price would help the economy grow.

It comes as diesel and unleaded 
prices hover around all-time highs. On Friday, average diesel prices 
have hit 145.45p a litre, with unleaded at 138.5p.

At present, 57.95p is taken in fuel 
duty for every litre bought on diesel and unleaded. VAT adds another 20 
per cent - around 24p at current prices.

As the price of fuel in the UK continues to grow there are fears that hauliers may look at repeating fuel protests seen in September 2000.

Much of the country's motorway network was brought to a grinding halt as lorry drivers reduced their speeds to 5mph rolling blockades.

That year the price of petrol was 76.9p a litre.

Top agenda: Many households will be hoping for some respite at the forecourts

According to the Centre for Economic Business Research (CEBR), even a cut of 2.5p per litre of petrol would boost the economy, creating 180,000 jobs in just five years.

The CEBR said that it is clear fuel duty has a very significant impact on business and consumer finances and even a modest reduction could support economic growth and give an important psychological boost to financially squeezed households.

Its calculations show that these benefits could be reaped without hurting the public purse.

These thoughts are echoed by campaign groups who are heaping pressure on the Chancellor to stop the planned hike.

Members of FairFuelUK, which is backed by the RAC and freight organisations, said that an even bolder cut, by 5p to a litre of fuel, would cost the Exchequer around £1billion but would be offset by intangible benefits of increased confidence and would add a further 30,000 jobs.

It also said that a 2.5p cut would boost GDP by 0.33 per cent.

Quentin Willson, spokesman for FairFuelUK, said: 'It is very frustrating that so many politicians are talking about every tax – the mansion tax, personal thresholds, VAT, the 50p rate – and so few are talking about the one tax that is right at the top of the agenda for families and businesses.'

He added that the planned hike in fuel taxes would be 'cruel and brutal' and claimed the Government was trying to ‘duck the central point’ by blaming price increases at the forecourt to volatile oil prices given the Treasury takes almost 82p in tax on every pound spent on fuel.

The campaign group has urged supporters to contact their MP by e-mail to put pressure on the Treasury for a 'cut in fuel duty' not just another freeze.

Jakes de Kock, Fuelcard Company’s marketing director, claimed not a rise in fuel duty could mean the end for many hauliers.

He said: 'This level of taxation simply cannot be maintained by the UK’s hauliers who have already implemented as many fuel-efficient practices as possible yet are still being financially squeezed to the point of no return.

'Ministers want economic growth, yet they’re shackling the fleet industry through unsustainable taxation. This is forcing businesses to turn down work because the high cost of fuel means there is no profit to be made.' 

The influential Ernst & Young Item Club says that the Chancellor has 'plenty of wiggle room’ to ease the pain on motorist tomorrow

Its senior advisor, Andrew Goodwin, said it would be 'an open goal' for Osborne in tomorrow's Budget. The report predicts that the Chancellor will have around £7billion to play with on Wednesday thanks to lower than expected borrowing.

Many motorists will have their fingers crossed that Osborne will deliver at least some respite for cash-strapped households and businesses.
