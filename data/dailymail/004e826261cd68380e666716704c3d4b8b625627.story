Britain's morning was thrown into disarray today when the ever-reliable shipping forecast failed to air as expected.

The BBC radio service, a trusted national institution, normally broadcasts at 5.20am each day on Radio 4.

But a technical error meant the BBC's World Service was played instead - making it the first time the forecast has failed to air since 1924.

Listeners quickly took to Twitter to 
express their bewilderment at the mix-up, with some left thinking they had 
woken up at the wrong time.

Hitting rocks: BBC listeners had their morning upended when the shipping forecast failed to air on Radio 4

Glitch: The shipping forecast, which provides reports on the seas around Britain, should have aired at 5.20am

Kirsty Connell said: 'Eep. The shipping forecast didn’t get broadcast on @BBCRadio4 this morning. Isn’t that the sign of impending nuclear armageddon?'

Mark Johnston tweeted: 'Nation in peril? #BBC radio fails to broadcast shipping forecast this morning. Expect Farage to blame Brussels within the hour'.

Nancetron said: 'The world service didn't hand to radio 4 so the shipping forecast didn't come on so I almost didn't leave the house.'

Jordan Rowland added: 'No shipping forecast? If UK submarinies don't get shipping forecast, don't they launch nuclear attack?' 

Graham Patterson said: 'Confused by 
#radio4 failing to start broadcasting at 05:25 this morning. No shipping
 forecast, no #bbcnewsbriefing. Bad start to a Friday'.

'Nation in peril?' Listeners quickly took to Twitter to express their bewilderment at the mix-up

The shipping forecast was created in 1861 after the deaths of 450 people on board the steam clipper Royal Charter which crashed into rocks off the North Wales coast in a hurricane.

The tragedy shocked the nation and a plan was put in place by Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy to establish 13 instrument stations to relay readings via telegraph to London.

Gale warnings were also issued at each station by hoisting flags to warn sailors.

Today the forecast is produced by the Met Office for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and airs four times daily - at 12.48am, 5.20am, 12.01pm and 5.54pm - on BBC Radio 4.

Despite the fact the terminology of the sea areas can 
appear nonsensical to the uninitiated, it attracts a far wider 
audience because of the distinctive - and some would say hypnotic - 
sound of the broadcast.

The problem continued on into the 5.30am airing of News Briefing until it finally cut back to the Radio 4 programme at 5.40am when presenter Kathy Clugston apologised for the glitch.

She said: 'Your listening to BBC Radio 4. Our apologies. It's 5.40am and we've been broadcasting happily News Briefing.

'But unfortunately due to a technical error, you've not been hearing us, so you have been hearing the BBC World Service.

'We're sorry about that. We're looking into it and we'll try and broadcast the shipping forecast for long-wave listeners during the course of the Today programme.'

The forecast, which provides reports on the seas around Britain, did eventually air at around 6.40am.

The service is produced by the Met Office on 
behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and is crucial for fishermen and shipping companies.

Broadcast four times a day - at 12.48am, 5.20am, 12.01pm and 5.54pm - it provides weather reports and updates on the state of the waters around Britain.

A Radio 4 spokesman told MailOnline: 'Unfortunately our usual switch from BBC World Service, which is broadcast on Radio 4 overnight, didn't go as planned and was delayed by around 20 minutes.

'The Radio 4 announcer explained the situation on air to listeners and the Today programme pointed out that the Shipping Forecast was broadcast on Radio 4 LW at 6.40am.

'We apologise for the inconvenience.'
