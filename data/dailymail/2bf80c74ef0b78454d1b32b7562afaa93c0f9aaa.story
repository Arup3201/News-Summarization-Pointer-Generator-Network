A 23-year-old man who checked luggage containing a loaded, defaced rifle at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport has been arrested.

Keenan Draughon tried to board a flight to Charlotte, New Carolina on Saturday morning when Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police found the weapons.

Police spokesman Joseph Pentangelo said the Clarksville, Tennessee resident was also carrying a second defaced rifle, two handguns and high-capacity magazines.

These ammunition magazines are illegal in New York.

U.S. Transportation Security Administration rules allow only unloaded weapons in checked luggage. No weapons are allowed in carry-on luggage.

Pentangelo said the serial numbers on the rifles were defaced.

The Clarksville man was being held pending an arraignment. It wasn't clear yet whether he has a lawyer.

He has been charged with criminal possession of a weapon.
