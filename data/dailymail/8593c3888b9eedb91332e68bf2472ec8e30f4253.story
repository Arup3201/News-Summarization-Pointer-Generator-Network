Facebook has sparked hysteria among its users by proposing to remove their right to vote on changes to the rules which govern the site.

The end to the site's experiment in democracy marks an attempt to gain more control over its own future as it tries to build a robust business model for the future.

But many users have reacted with fury, and attempted to protect themselves against changes to Facebook's privacy policy by posting a lengthy - but useless - legal disclaimer on their own profile pages.

Users hoping to stop the firm exploiting their data to make money will be disappointed to learn that updating their Facebook status provides no legal protection whatsoever.

Rule change: Facebook will no longer allow users to vote on its policies

Outrage: The backlash to the firm's decision is another headache for founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg

Should Facebook end their democratic system which lets users vote on changes to site rules?

Since 2009, the web giant has held a vote on any changes to its privacy policies which attract at least 7,000 comments.

The referendum then overrides the new policy as long as 30 per cent of Facebook's active users - around 300million people - participate in the vote.

But now the company is stepping back from the innovative reform, which was intended to mark it out as a community governed by its users rather than a typical firm focussed only on the bottom line.

Facebook issued a statement claiming the voting mechanism 'resulted in a system that incentivized the quantity of comments over their quality'.

The site promised to replace the system with a new process offering 'more meaningful feedback and engagement' - but did not elaborate on how they would continue to take the view of users into account.

Announcement: Facebook has revealed it is revoking users' right to vote on its privacy policy

Useless: Many users have posted notices like this one on their own profile, but they provide no protection

However, Facebook account-holders hoping to retain their democratic rights have one last chance to stop the change - as nearly 20,000 people have already registered their opposition to the new policy, the site is likely to hold a vote this week or next or whether the change will go through.

It will be the third time in the site's history that it has allowed its users to vote on a policy change.

The firm insists that even if the right to vote on changes is repealed, it will still consult users on its privacy policies and seek their approval before sharing more of their information with advertisers.

But Facebook's assurances are apparently not enough for thousands of its users, who have lashed out at the site.

Disaster: The social network has seen its share price slump since its IPO in May

In an attempt to prevent the site from using their data for commercial purposes, many have posted statements such as: 'In response to the new Facebook guidelines I hereby declare that my copyright is attached to all of my personal details, illustrations, paintings, writing, publications, photos and videos, etc. (as a results of the Berner Convention.)

'For commercial use of the above my written consent is needed at all times. (Anyone reading this can copy this text and paste it on their Facebook Wall. This will place them under protection of copyright laws.)'

Unfortunately for worried Facebook users, posting that comment has no legal force, and does not overrule the terms of service to which people agree when they start using the site.

The mention of the 'Berner Convention' is particularly unhelpful, as there is no such thing - it appears to be an erroneous reference to the Berne Convention which governs the validity of copyright law across national borders.

Ultimately, the only way to stop Facebook exploiting your information for commercial gain is to delete all your posts and shut down your account.

This latest PR disaster caps off a dismal year for the social network, which launched a much-hyped $100billion IPO in May but has seen its share price slump by a third since then amidst fears it will be unable to convert its runaway popularity into lasting profit.
