In what is believed to be a deliberate and sickening act of animal cruelty, a man attacked a chicken and then got his dog to kill it.

A man purchased a live chicken from a produce pet store in Enfield and took it to his home on Rawson Street at Haberfield on July 15. 

It’s alleged the man assaulted the chicken before encouraging his dog to attack and kill the defenceless animal.

Investigations led police from Burwood Local Area Command to find video footage of the alleged incident which a police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia was filmed on a mobile phone.

Following inquiries, a search warrant was executed at a home on Rawson Street at Haberfield just after 6.30am on Thursday. 

A 20-year-old man was arrested at the home and taken to Burwood Police Station where he was charged with the following offences:

Torture, beat and cause death to animal, commit an act of cruelty upon an animal, commit an act of aggravated cruelty upon an animal and cause/procure/permit/encourage or incite animal fight.

He was given bail and will appear at Burwood Local Court on September 25.

RSPCA investigators seized the dog.
