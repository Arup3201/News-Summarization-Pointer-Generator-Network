Confrontation: Danzil Hiles came face-to-face with the man acquitted of killing his son Jonathan

The father of a student killed by a single punch in a Greek nightclub came face-to-face with the man cleared of his manslaughter at his son's inquest and branded him a liar.

Jonathan Hiles, of Cardiff, was dancing in a nightclub with friends on the Greek island of Zante in July 2007 when he was hit in the face.

Friends say he confronted a fellow reveller who had urinated on them in the Rescue nightclub.

After being struck to the face, the 18-year-old hockey player fell from a stage, hitting his head on the dance floor.

He died in hospital after being airlifted to Athens.

It was the day before his 19th birthday.

Holidaymaker Andrew Symeou, 25, from north London, was later extradited to Greece and spent a year in custody before eventually being cleared of manslaughter.

Mr Hiles’ father Denzil, 62, confronted Mr Symeou at the inquest of his late son - calling the 25-year-old university graduate a 'liar' and saying he wanted to 'string him up'.

The heated exchanges between the pair prompted repeated pleas for calm from Cardiff Coroner Mary Hassell.

But today, the coroner ruled that Jonathan, of Cardiff, was unlawfully killed and not by Mr Symeou.

Mr Symeou said: 'I have never ever hit anyone in my life.

'And I have never ever urinated in a public place, that’s animal behaviour.

'I sympathise with Mr Hiles’ family. To lose a son is the worst thing to happen in someone’s life. But I did not kill your son. I am telling the truth.'

Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard that Mr Symeou and Mr Hiles did not know each other - and had been holidaying in Zante separately.

Tragic: Jonathan Hiles was killed after he fell from a stage in a nightclub on the Greek island of Zante

Mr Symeou and a group of friends had arrived on the island on July 8 - with two more friends joining them on July 12.

The holiday was the first time the group had been abroad without their parents.

Mr Hiles had flown to the resort of Laganas with a group of friends to celebrate his forthcoming 19th birthday.

Less than 24 hours after arriving, the Welsh teenager’s party was at Rescue when they were involved in an altercation in the early hours of July 20.

Mr Hiles’ friends told coroner Ms Hassell they had been dancing on a 'chest-high' stage in the club at around 1.30am when another reveller urinated on them.

Some went to the toilet to clean up but Mr Hiles and his friend Mark O’Gorman stayed put.

Yesterday, Mr O’Gorman said he saw his friend hit on the left cheek after Mr Hiles had asked in a non-aggressive tone: 'What are you doing?'.

He said he was certain the man he had seen hit Mr Hiles was Mr Symeou.

But friends of the 25-year-old Londoner say they did not arrive at Rescue until 4am.

Chris Kyriacou said he was confident the group had not split up at any point of their night out.

He and another friend, Charlie Klitou, later signed a police statement in a Greek police station saying Mr Symeou had 'panicked' and fled the club after a fight.

But giving evidence Mr Kyriacou told the coroner that the pair had been beaten into signing the statements.

He said: 'They first asked me about my heritage and where my family was from - I said my family were Greek-Cypriot.

'They said I was lucky, otherwise things were going to be a lot worse.

'First they put me in a completely dark room for around 30 minutes. Then they turned the lights on and around six other officers filed into the room. I was very scared and intimidated.

'They kept asking me ‘what happened?’ and I told them I didn’t know.

'One officer went ballistic and grabbed me by my neck. I was then hit around the face and punched to the head.

'My thinking was ‘I am just going to have to do what they want me to do’. I needed to get out of the police station for the safety of my own life.

'I did not know what was going to happen to me.'

Mr Symeou wept in court as an inquest found he had nothing to do with the death of Jonathan Hiles.

The coroner blamed Greek police for failing to catch the real killer.

Coroner Mary Hassell said the only reason he was ever charged is because of the Greek police’s 'misguided' efforts to solve the crime.

Coroner Mary Hassell said: 'I do not know who the person was who killed Jonathan but I know that person was not Andrew Symeou.

'Jonathan’s death is an absolute tragedy to his family - but they were not the only one who have been hurt here.'

She recorded a verdict of unlawful killing on Jonathan who died in July 2007.

Sports science student Jonathan’s travelled from his home in Llandaff, Cardiff, to the Greek party island with a group of friends.

Miss Hassell said: 'Statements taken by the Greek police are not worth the paper they are written on.

'Instead they were concocted in a misguided effort to solve this crime.

'The story regarding statements given by Andrew’s friends I would not have believed unless I had heard it with my own ears.

'They were not only bullied and intimidated but they were beaten - they said what they did because they were fearful and with good reason.

'I have found Andrew and his friends to be utterly truthful, wholly accurate and entirely compelling.'

Home Office pathologist Andrew Davidson said Jonathan, who was not under the influence of drink or drugs, died of a head injury following the incident in July 2007.

Speaking after the case Jonathan’s dad Denzil, 62, said: 'My son’s killer is still out there - I don’t know what more I can do.'
