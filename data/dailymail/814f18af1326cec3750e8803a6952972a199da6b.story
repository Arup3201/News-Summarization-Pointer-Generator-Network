Southampton’s Senegalese star Sadio Mane might be away on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations, but the forward is still finding ways to keep in touch with his team.

After watching his side beat Ghana with a last-gasp winner, Mane revealed that he has been texting Ronald Koeman and his team-mates after Saints games.

The player, forced to sit out his country’s Cup of Nations opener because of injury, said he still watches every minute of his club’s games back home, despite being in Equatorial Guinea.

‘I’m missing them, because it’s my team,’ said Mane after the 2-1 win over Ghana in Mongom. ‘But I’m happy because I’m watching them every, every game, and I’m happy for the team.

‘Every time I send a message to the coach, to say “good game, good victory.”’

Mane has played a key role in Southampton’s superb Premier League form, which has seen them reach the Champions League spots.

But the winger, who will be away until at least the end of January, and possibly until mid-February believes they can continue to win in his absence.

‘It was very important for them to win (against Newcastle) for the confidence,’ he added.
