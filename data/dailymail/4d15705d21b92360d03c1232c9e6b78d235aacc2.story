A kitten cruelly dumped into a bottle bank escaped with his life after miaowing so loudly that passers-by rescued him.

Nine-week-old Archer was left to die surrounded by discarded glass at a recycling centre in Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

The tiny animal was just hours from death, but managed to make enough noise that he was noticed and free.

Dumped: Archer was eventually rescued from the bottle bank in Harrogate, North Yorkshire

Rescued: After the RSPCA was called in they were able to pluck starving Archer from the bin

Archer - named after Archers schnapps because he was found surrounded by alcohol bottles - was taken in by the RSPCA and is now being looked after by volunteers.

Harrogate's RSPCA branch manager, Nicola Outhwaite, said: 'Thank God he has got such a loud voice for a little thing. It most certainly saved his life.'

Archer now lives with 'foster owners' Dave and Alex Lee, who have given him a place to cat-nap until a permanent home can be found.

Mr Lee, 41, an electrician, said: 'Archer is so adorable. He's so energetic and playful, it's hard to see how anyone could have done something like this to him.Â 

'He is very vocal. He wakes us up every morning with his loud miaow-ing because he wants feeding.

'It's not a surprise that he managed to get someone's attention while he was stuck in that bottle bank. When he wants something, he lets you know about it!'

Namesake: The RSCPA gave Archer his name as a reference to the alcohol bottles he was surrounded by

Vocal: Archer, pictured left with 'foster' owner Alex Lee, has been described as 'energetic and playful' - and has kept to his reputation of making lots of noise when he wants something

Archer has been fostered with two other kittens, Jack and Rose, who were abandoned in a garden.

Mrs Lee, 32, a financial controller, said: 'As an animal lover, it breaks my heart to think they were just thrown out. I am so pleased we did it, I didn't even know fostering was an option until I saw the post on Facebook.'

Mrs Outhwaite said: 'The RSPCA cattery is full and newborn kittens need lots of love and attention and cuddles, so it has been great to get them fostered.

'They are all coming out of their shell and getting used to people so will make great pets.'
