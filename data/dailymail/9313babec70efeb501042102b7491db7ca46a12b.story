Rule breach: Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher faces disciplinary charges after interviewing murderer Chris Halliwell without issuing a caution and without a solicitor being present

A murder detective who failed to read a killer his rights when persuading him to lead him to the bodies of two women could now face the sack.

Wiltshire Police Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher was praised for his bravery after Christopher Halliwell led him to where he had dumped the body of missing 22-year-old Sian O'Callaghan in 2011.

But the Independent Police Complaints Committee has said the officer should face a gross misconduct hearing after failing to read Halliwell his rights and interviewing him without a solicitor being present in a bid to find Miss O'Callaghan.

He should also face disciplinary action for briefing the press on the case when Wiltshire Police had ordered him not to.

Miss O'Callaghan, 22, had gone missing after a night out at a Swindon nightclub in March 2011.

Taxi driver Halliwell, 49, had been arrested days after the disappearance and in a three hour period led police to her body.

The killer then asked the detective if he 'wanted another one' and led him to the body of Rebecca Godden-Edwards who had been missing since 2002.

The 20-year-old had been missing since 2002, but her estranged family had never reported her missing because they believed she had moved to London after becoming hooked on drugs.

Despite revealing the location of the bodies, Halliwell was never convicted of killing Miss Godden-Edwards after a judge ruled that his confession was inadmissible because Mr Fulcher failed to follow the correct arrest procedures.

He was jailed for 25 years for killing Miss O'Callaghan.

Mr Fulcher admitted he broke the rules in court last year, but said he thought he was doing 'the right thing'.

He was suspended for a year while an investigation was carried out but has since returned to the force.

The investigation into Mr Fulcher's handling of the arrest found that he had breached the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) and disobeyed orders by releasing information to the media and meeting with journalists from the BBC and ITV.

The resulting IPCC report said: ‘The effect of 
Det Supt Fulcher’s actions was catastrophic, particularly on the 
prosecution of Mr Halliwell for the murder of Rebecca [Godden-Edwards].

'Det Supt Fulcher stated had he not 
proceeded as he did, Rebecca’s remains may never have been found.

'However it is not possible to determine what may have happened if Mr 
Halliwell had been immediately conveyed to custody after his arrest and 
urgent interview by detectives.’

IPCC Deputy Chair Rachel Cerfontyne 
said: ‘Detective Superintendent Fulcher’s actions were in deliberate 
breach of PACE and we find that he has a case to answer for gross 
misconduct.

‘Also, Detective Superintendent 
Fulcher, despite no longer having responsibility for Operation Mayan 
(the murder investigation), and against express orders, went ahead with 
meetings about the case with journalists from both the BBC and ITV.’

The mother of Miss Godden-Edwards reacted with fury at the report yesterday accusing the watchdog of putting the killer’s rights above hers.

She said: ‘He’s my hero and should not be punished.

‘He’s accused of breaching Halliwell’s rights, but what about mine? Don’t they count for anything?

‘Detective Superintendent Fulcher should be hailed as a hero, not as someone who overstepped the mark.

‘The rules should be tailored to help us as much as an accused person.

‘Without Detective Superintendent Fulcher’s initiative I would never have had closure.

‘Yes, sadly Becky is dead but I could have spent the rest of my life wondering if she was still out there alive, simply not wanting to see me, or dead.’

She has now called for a public debate on PACE rules.

Hunt: Police search for Miss O'Callaghan's body following her disappearance

During the case, Wiltshire Chief Constable Patrick Geenty said his officer had been ‘brave’ and that he hoped he would have done the same thing.

But Halliwell’s barrister accused the detective of riding roughshod over the law and returning to ‘70s-style policing’.

The IPCC conducted a review after Miss Godden-Edwards’ father, John Godden complained about the officer’s actions.

If the force agree with the IPCC findings, the detective will face a gross misconduct panel which will decide his fate.

A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: ‘We are taking this matter very seriously and we are currently in the process of carefully considering the recommendations made within the report and our subsequent response to the IPCC.

‘We will be taking into account the needs of the families whilst deliberating the recommendations.

‘Wiltshire Police are continuing to offer welfare support to Det Supt Fulcher throughout this on-going process.’
