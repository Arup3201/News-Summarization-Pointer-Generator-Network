Millions of young Britons dream of the moment when they will finally climb onto the property ladder and get the keys to their own front door.

But how many of them imagine that their first home will be in Milton Keynes?

A report, published today by the financial information firm Experian, reveals how first-time buyers are being forced to buy in towns which might not be everybody’s first choice.

Desirable? One of the MANY roundabouts in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire

The Buckinghamshire town, best-known for its concrete cows and complicated system of roundabouts, is named today as Britain’s first-time buyer hotspot.

The report reveals one in ten households in the town - established in 1967 and now with a population of around 245,000 - is a first-time buyer.

Another hotspot is Slough, a town which is still recovering from its damning appearance in the famous Sir John Betjeman poem.

For many people, the town, sandwiched between the M40 and M4, reminds them of the opening line: ‘Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough!’

For others, it is a reminder of BBC’s The Office, starring Ricky Gervais, as Slough was the headquarters of the fictional firm Wernham Hogg.

The Office also provides a nod to another hotspot - the Wiltshire town from where ‘the Swindon lot’ came to join the Slough HQ.

Other first-time buyer hotspots will be named today as Aldershot, Dartford, Basingstoke and Crawley.

It comes as the number of first-time buyers in Britain has collapsed due to the toxic combination of high property prices and a chronic squeeze in mortgages.

For a young person to buy, they need to be either very rich, very well-paid or have parents who are prepared to lend, or give, them the money for a deposit.

The average young person in their twenties earns around £21,000, but the average house prices is around £165,000, an impossible gap for many young people to jump.

The Experian report, published today, said: ‘Ever since homeownership began around the 50s and 60s, Londoners have had to move out to the regions to be able to afford a home.’ It said towns such as Milton Keynes are ‘very attractive and practical places to live which allow first-time purchasers to have the lifestyle as well as to get on the property ladder.’

Table shows the percentage of first time buyers in different towns and the average property price.

1) Milton Keynes 9.5%, £202,425

2) Dartford 9.3%, £205,324

3) Swindon 8.9%, £169,571

4) Aldershot 8.6%, £216,022

5) Hempstead Valley 8.2%, £169,255

6) Basingstoke 8.1%, £251,870

7) Crawley 7.8%, £200,274

8) Slough 7.8%, £207,593

9) Bexleyheath 7.6%, £224,096

10) Aylesbury 6.9%,£264,923

David Hill, chief executive of Milton Keynes Council said: ‘Milton Keynes is a very prosperous place which is flourishing despite these tough economic times.

‘The fact that we have so many new businesses opening or relocating here means that we can offer first-time buyers much needed job security.’ London dominates the list of places where first-time buyers are least likely to be have any luck, particularly boroughs such as Hammersmith, Kensington and Chelsea.

In Milton Keynes, the average home costs £202,000, compared to £1.3million in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

Matt Griffiths, from the campaign group Priced Out, said a generation of young people forced to rent, when they are desperate to buy, fuels considerable anger.

He said: ‘Most renters can be thrown out of their flat at two months’ notice. We have the most insecure rental market in Europe.

‘This insecurity is undermining family life. It is really tough being a renter with a family.

SLOUGH: 'Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough,' wrote Sir John Betjeman in his poem. 7.8 per cent of homes in the town are occupied by first time buyers

SWINDON: 8.9 per cent of homes in the Wiltshire town are occupied by first time buyers and the average house price is £169,571

‘It also impacts on the basic things that you can’t paint your child’s nursery, or invest in making the place where you live a home where your child has a sense of stability.’ The Government is trying to help buyers, by allowing them to put down a deposit of only five per cent on new-build homes sold for up to £500,000.

If you wanted to buy a £200,000 home, a typical buyer would need to put down a 20 per cent deposit, or £40,000. Under the ‘NewBuy Guarantee’, they can put down only £10,000.

When the scheme was launched last year, David Cameron said he hopes it will help people to fulfil their dream of owning their own home.

The Prime Minister said he wanted ‘everyone in this country’ to experience the ‘magic moment’ of getting the keys to their first flat, ‘not just better-off people.’
