It's not just toilet humour - a Canadian stuntwoman has ridden her way into the record books on the fastest loo in the world.

Jolene Van Vugt, 31, managed to reach 46mph on the motorised toilet in the most rushed bathroom break of all time.

Ms Van Vugt's remarkable achievement unseated previous record-holder, Edd China, who hit 42mph on a lavatory in Milan, Italy, in March 2011.

His toilet was called the 'Bog Standard', and consisted of a motorcycle and sidecar hidden under a bathroom set consisting of bathtub, sink, and laundry bin.

The bike's controls were hidden in the sink.

Flushed with success, a relieved Ms Van Vugt told the BBC: 'I flew into Australia yesterday and 
came out here to jump straight on the toilet.

'That 
was so fun and I'm stoked to get the record.'

Her adventure in Sydney on Wednesday was not without its stomach-clenching moments, however.

To win the record, the stuntwoman had to drive the contraption - essentially a go-kart with porcelain toilet in place of a normal seat - 330 feet in both directions.

An average of the two speeds was taken to give her the new world record.

Early on, the toilet needed repairs because its chain kept falling off, and later she nearly had to abandon the whole attempt as the lavatory wobbled all over the road.

'The cobblestones were a bit dangerous 
and proved problematic for me,' she told Australia's Daily Telegraph.

'The kick off 
them almost threw me.'

World records are nothing new to Ms Van 
Vugt, whose previous records include being the first woman to 
backflip a dirt bike, performing the longest backflip and backflipping a
dirtbike over Arizona's Grand Canyon, according to Sky News.

She told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'I've broken Guinness World Records before but I never thought I'd be the fastest toilet rider in the world.'
