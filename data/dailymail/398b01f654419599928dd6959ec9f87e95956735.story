The hunt is on for a violent duo who are terrorising motorists by impersonating police, using a red and blue flashing phone app to trick drivers into pulling over, and then assaulting them.

The pair, thought to have carried out three roadside attacks, attach the device to the car.

All three attacks have been carried out in the Gold Coast area over the period of 12 days.

The phone app, similar to the one pictured on the right, is meant to give the illusion of the red and blue flashing lights on top of a police car

The most recent was on Enid Ave at Southport on Thursday at 4.30am.

Earlier incidents happened on Christine Avenue at Varsity Lakes on May 11 about 4pm and another on Bundall Road on the Gold Coast on May 3 about 10pm.

Gold Coast man Terry Hicks was the latest victim in the string of attacks.

Mr Hicks pulled over on Enid Ave and wound down his window when a car behind him started flashing red and blue lights.

He thought it was a police officer performing a random breath test.

Terry Hicks (pictured here late last year) fought off his attacker early Thursday morning after he was pulled over by a man posing as a police officer

Before the 24-year-old could turn around to see his male attacker he was hit three times in the neck with a Taser-like weapon.

The attacker also yelled 'obscenities' at him.

But Mr Hicks caught the man off guard when he plucked up the courage to fight back and make his escape.

'I leaned back over the passenger side and kicked the man through the driver’s side window,' he said.

'He stumbled back and I repositioned myself in the driver’s seat.

'I shifted into drive and drove away at a fast pace and I called 000.'

The car that pulled Mr Hicks over was a white 4WD dual cab utility with a silver bull bar.

In the incident on Christine Avenue, an off-duty police officer was left unharmed when he was pulled over by a blue Holden Commodore sedan as the driver sped off before he approached the officer's vehicle.

A red and blue strobe light was attached to the grill of the stolen Commodore.

This followed an incident on Bundall Avenue where a 54-year-old woman and her male passenger were pulled over after a siren sounded and they saw red and blue flashing lights.

A man approached the driver's window and started yelling at her before a second man approached the car.

The passenger then had a brief conversation with both men before he was punched in the face by one of them.

The pair then took off in a silver blue car.

The 64-year-old passenger had bruising and swelling to his eye.

Mr Hicks said these attacks made him lose faith in society.

'It has made me distrust any red and blue lights I see and I don’t think I would be too comfortable going past the same area in a while,' he said.

'I went to hospital after this and I was luckily to receive no injuries except slight bruising to the neck.

'I don't understand how someone could come out and do this to someone and do this for no reason.

'The officers and doctors said luckily I did what I did or I would have received more fatal injuries.'
