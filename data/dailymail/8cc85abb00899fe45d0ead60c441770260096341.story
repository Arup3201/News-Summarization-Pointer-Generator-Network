The widow of a National Guard soldier who was allegedly shot by a 15-year-old boy at a Tennessee armory has spoken out about her husband's death.

Jennifer Braden, wife of slain Sgt. 1st Class Michael W. Braden, told the Tennessean 'We're still trying to make sense of it. I keep asking why.'

'He always went out of his way to help. I've seen him reach in his wallet and pull out his last $10 and give it to somebody,' she also told the paper.

Speaking about suspect Christopher Farrar's age, Braden said 'He's just a child. I don't know why.'

Police found 'several' firearms Thursday at Farrar's family's home in Lobelville.

Farrar didn't work at the armory - which is 
usually locked - but somehow gained access and fired 
several shots, authorities said.

One struck Braden, 45, who had been with the guard for more than 20 years and 
served two tours in Kuwait, law enforcement and Guard officials said. He
 died later at a hospital.

'Several' weapons were uncovered in the search, said Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman Josh DeVine, and ballistic experts examined whether any were involved in Wednesday's shooting in the rural community of Lobelville, about 50 miles southwest of Nashville.

DeVine said agents were looking into 'all leads' - but the analyses of the weapons found at the suspect's house suggested he did not use a gun seized at the armory.

A motive has not yet been established.

Farrar, who was expelled from high school
 for drug offenses, was being held without bond at a juvenile detention 
facility, DeVine said. He could, however, be tried as an adult if the 
case is shifted from the juvenile system. Farrar was arrested without 
incident at his family's home in Lobelville, set amid rolling hills and 
woodlands.

Maj. Gen. Terry 'Max' Haston, who oversees the state's National Guard, said no extra security protocols at the armory were planned because he believes 'security policies are pretty good as they are.'

'I put out a memorandum this morning to all of our armories to ensure that we continue to do the policies that we already have in place,' he said.

However, he acknowledged the loss of a comrade is tough.

'It's always a tragedy when we lose a soldier under any conditions, but to lose one like this is heart wrenching,' said Haston.

It was unclear whether Farrar and Braden knew each other. But Braden, a father of three children, had wide contacts in the area because of outreach with local inmates assigned to help clean the armory as part of a program led by the Perry County Sheriff's Department.

A sheriff's department K-9 officer, Rodd Staid, said Braden often supervised the prisoners on the cleaning detail and would try to find them jobs or encourage them to consider military service after their release from custody.

'Excellent guy who would do anything to help anybody,' said Staid. 'It's a tragedy. We lost a good man.'

DeVine said the building doesn't have surveillance cameras, but at least one other person in addition to the shooter and the victim was at the armory at the time of the shooting. But DeVine said it was unclear whether there were any eyewitnesses.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam issued a statement Thursday lamenting Braden's death.

'It's a tragic day when we lose a decorated hero who has served his country so well,' Haslam said.

Willodean Kilpatrick, a neighbor of Farrar, said the boy lived with his aunt and arrived about a year ago from Louisiana. She said she would sometimes exchange pleasantries with the boy as he passed and described him as 'quiet.'

Farrar's alleged Facebook account lists him as a 'Satanist,' the New York Daily News points out.

Farrar appear to be a member of several groups, including 'Hail Satan,' 'SATANIST ARMY!!!! ALL HAIL SATAN!,' and 'Hail satan (Brutal).'

On the latter's Facebook page, Farrar apparently wrote 'Me and My home Boy just made a closed group called "satanist" add me and send me a message saying u wanna join and ill add u Its just basically made for satanist to post evil s*** and Hate god Lmao 666 b****.'

Braden's son Wyatt, 17, told WREG he plans to go through with enlisting in the Army, despite his father's death. 

'It's definitely going to be something I think about as I put on that uniform,' he said.

'When it comes time - if that ever does - come to that point in my military career, I hope I go out the same way,' he also said. 

Wyatt's account to the affiliate station indicated that his father saved another man.

'He died a hero,' Wyatt said. 'That kid walked in and my dad told the other soldier that was there, you know, "Stay in the bathroom." He fought the kid to the best of his abilities.'
