Crime: Jeffrey B. Maurer, pictured, is accused of beating his 87-year-old father and 85-year-old mother to death

A man accused of allegedly beating his elderly parents to death with a hammer has been ordered to stand trial on first degree murder charges over their deaths.

Jeffrey B. Maurer, 53, from Detroit Michigan is alleged to have beat his 87-year-old father and 85-year-old mother to death at their home.

Maurer, who has a history of mental abuse faces an automatic penalty of life in prison without parole if convicted. 

On January 19, the couple's daughter called authorities and reported that she was unable to reach her parents.

Sheriff's deputies went to their home in Rochester Hills and found the bodies of William and Gayle Maurer in a vehicle in the garage.

Investigators said the couple died after receiving severe blows to the head.

According to police, Maurer was found bloody and disheveled after the crime and was immediately taken into custody. 

Officers also found two bloody hammers and 'a great deal of blood-stained clothing and a towel' at the scene. 

It's not yet known what the motive for the crime is.

On Tuesday, a Rochester Hills district judge ruled that there is enough evidence to try him in Oakland County Circuit Court on first-degree murder charges. 

Maurer's rap sheet also includes a previous domestic violence conviction involving his parents.
