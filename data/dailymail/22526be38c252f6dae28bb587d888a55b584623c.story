At Halloween he terrorised the population of a Californian city by pretending to sneeze so hard his head fell off.

The season for trick-or-treating is long over, but U.S. magician Rich Ferguson could not resist unleashing his grisly stunt on more unsuspecting victims - this time lurking in a lift to give people waiting to get in a fright.

Mr Ferguson, also known as the Ice Breaker, previously stalked the streets of San Luis Obispo to shock a series of passersby with the prank - and his hilarious video footage of their reactions racked up millions of hits on YouTube.

Prank: The man waits inside the lift to trick the unsuspecting people about to get in

Shock: The prankster pretends to sneeze so violently his head falls off - much to the horror of the man and woman waiting to get in the lift

After footage of his 'head drop' trick became an internet smash, the magician said he had only performed the prank in daylight because doing so in the dark would 'freak people out big time'.

But Mr Ferguson must have changed his mind, as the latest video footage shows him lying in wait for people getting into the elevator at night time.

The stunt meets with mixed reactions in the video footage, with some witnesses screaming, some laughing, and others simply gaping in shock.

The magician has not revealed just how he performs the trick, which sees his upper body remain upright while his head 'drops' into his hands.

Gotcha: Two more victims get the same treatment as they wait to get in a lift

Reaction: Magician Rob Ferguson decided to try out his 'head drop' trick in a public lift in the middle of the night

Fright: These two young men look stunned as they see the prankster's head 'fall off'

The unfortunate people who used the lift while the magician was lurking inside may be deserving of some sympathy, but not as much as contestants one Brazilian television show who fell victim to a truly terrifying prank.

In footage from the show, unsuspecting adults are fooled into getting into a lift that has been rigged in advance. When the doors close, the lights go out to trick the occupants into thinking there has been a power cut.

If that wasn't unsettling enough, a young girl dressed up as a ghost then emerges from a hidden trap door and climbs into the lift before the lights suddenly flicker back on.

Victims' reactions at the sight of the creepy girl range from emitting a blood-curdling scream, to cowering in the corner, to jamming on the lift's emergency button.
