Kurt Zouma claims it is too early to be compared to France legend Marcel Desailly as he prepares for the Champions League clash with Paris St-Germain.

Desailly is remembered as a Chelsea great and won the World Cup with France in 1998 during a glorious period for Les Bleus.

Zouma, who has displaced Gary Cahill in the Chelsea team recently, has shown similarities to Desailly with his reading of the game alongside captain John Terry.

The defender said: 'I am very proud of the comparisons, I didn't know about them but Desailly was a great player. It is too early to talk about me the same way.

'I have to keep working, showing that I am ready and that I can do it at the highest level. The team is winning and we are winning well.'

Mourinho nominated Zouma and Real Madrid's Raphael Varane as two of the best young defenders in world football before Chelsea's clash with Everton in the Barclays Premier League last week.

Zouma, 20, admitted that he is still learning the game after finally making the breakthrough at Stamford Bridge under Jose Mourinho.

He said: 'He is the best coach in he world, he hates losing and we learn a lot technically and tactically. We want to win every game we play. He conveys that and I have learnt so much.'

Zouma will mark Zlatan Ibrahimovic if he is picked to play ahead of Gary Cahill in the Parc des Princes.

The Frenchman said: 'I played against him once when I was at St Etienne and we drew the match. He is impressive and intelligent.

'PSG have great players and we will need to be prepared.'
