Chelsea are fast becoming the new Manchester United.

The red which used to dominate the Barclays Premier League for so many years is slowly fading to blue.

Chelsea's utter, unbeaten dominance of the league this season has echoes of the bygone era of Sir Alex Ferguson.

So far a manager and team have failed to fill the vast void he left behind when he retired in 2013.

But Mourinho looks to be finally doing just that this campaign.

His Chelsea team are sweeping aside the rest and in the process they are becoming the club and manager every other fan loves to hate.

The Portuguese has even taken to being unnecessarily prickly and moody in his post and pre-match press conference, despite the team remaining unbeaten.

That atmosphere was a common theme of Ferguson's reign, which the Chelsea boss appears to be mirroring. He'll probably be banning the BBC, soon.

Will he now forge an empire for many years to come in the blue part of London?

Mourinho has stated he plans to stay at Stamford Bridge for a long time now and they have made it clear they want him to.

'I'm not here thinking about my next move because I don't want to have a next move,' he told the Evening Standard at the start of the year. 'I will have a next move if and when Chelsea decides it's time for that.

'I'm not chasing new experiences, trying to find where I like it more, where I can make new things for my career — no. It's a completely different perspective.'

He has an older family now, a 15-year son and 18-year-old daughter, who he does not want to keep moving around to different countries, having lived in Spain, Italy and England over the past decade.

'I'm not a person with a big social life,' he added. 'I just want the simple things in life but even the simple things I lost in Italy, Spain and Portugal.

'I think London is the only place in Europe where I can keep these little things of life. I can go to school and wait for my son and daughter and the parents feel me as another parent.

'I can go to walk on Sloane Street or Old Bond Street and if somebody disturbs me it is not an English person for sure. It's some tourist that sees me and they can't control themselves. The English person is much more polite and respectful in relation to the private life of the person.'

All the signs are pointing to Mourinho starting to form his own empire, similar to that which Ferguson built up over 27 years.

Chelsea have made their intentions to keep him very clear, too.

'I hope he will stay 10 years,' former Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay said at the start of this season. 'Having the security of Jose is great for me - he knows the club, knows me. Jose can deal with the media in a different way from some of the other managers we've had.

'He takes the pressure not only away from the players but also from the club. He allows us to manage and me in particular to drive.'

This could be the start of something major – the Premier League could be awash with blue for many years to come.
