Victims of paedophile DJ Jimmy Savile will receive compensation but less than they had hoped after a judge ordered that lawyers must be paid first

Women who say they were sexually abused by paedophile DJ Jimmy Savile will receive compensation but less than they had hoped after a judge ordered that lawyers must be paid first. 

The Court of Appeal today sanctioned a compensation scheme set up for victims of the television star.

However, three appeal judges said many legal bills would have to be paid out of Savile’s estate - which is thought to be worth around £3 million.

Lawyers for the victims said the appeal court decision to back the compensation scheme will bring 'great relief'.

They said they are analysing the decision on legal costs - which means that less money will be available to give to victims in compensation - and considering whether to ask the Supreme Court to consider the issue.

A High Court judge had sanctioned the compensation scheme following a hearing in London in February - despite objections from a charity which is the major beneficiary of Savile’s estate.

The Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust said the scheme - agreed between the estate executor, the NatWest bank, and lawyers representing alleged victims - did not assess the 'validity' of claimants and lacked a 'process of evaluation'.

Trustees of the charity had asked the Court of Appeal to review Mr Justice Sales’ decision.

However, appeal judges today concluded that Mr Justice Sales had been right to sanction the scheme - and right to refuse to order that NatWest should be replaced as executor.

But they said he had been wrong when ordering the trust to pay some of its legal costs and some of the costs run up by the alleged victims. They said those bills should be paid out of estate coffers.

Experts initially put the value of Savile’s estate at around £4 million. But in February, Mr Justice Sales said a 'range of expenses' had been incurred and the estate’s value was reduced to about £3.3 million.

Liz Dux, a lawyer at law firm Slater & Gordon - which represents victims, said: 'Today’s ruling will bring great relief to Savile’s many victims who have been living with the uncertainty of not knowing whether they would be blocked in their claims. They just want some recognition of what they have been through so they can then be able to move on with their lives.'

She said women had signed up to the scheme in the hope of receiving “some form of justice” without the need for 'drawn-out and costly litigation'.

The scheme would be scrutinised, had checks and balances in place and was not a 'charter for fraudulent claims', she said.

Ms Dux said the implications of the costs decision were being analysed. She said she did not know what the costs figure was - but said it would not run into millions of pounds.

One of Jimmy Savile's victims has branded the reduced compensation payments as 'absolutely abysmal' and an insult to those who suffered.

Former Broadmoor patient Alison Pink, who is now called Steven George after a sex change, was abused by Savile as a 17-year-old as while watching Top Of The Pops.

Mr George's share of the compensation has already been halved from £15,000 to £7,500 and he is braced for the sum to be slashed even more.

'We are being penalised because there are so many victims,' said Mr George, 60, who lives in Portsmouth.

'All the court did today was say that the original agreement to pay compensation must continue.

'We are all being rubbished. Our suffering is not being taken seriously.

'People do not appreciate we need this compensation for long term care. Many of these victims are seriously disabled.

'The Government turned a blind eye and did not investigate. Now they arethrowing us to the wolves. They are saying "Have a few quid and bugger off".'

Mr George said the Government should step in to prop up the process because the sums going to victims were shrinking, and many of them were in NHS care when they were targetted.

'I am not the only victim who had to keep seeing him because they were in hospital,' he said.

'The government originally said they would underwrite this. But I do not see any signs of that at all.

'Jeremy Hunt made this big apology to all the victims as health secretary -then did nothing.

'There are a lot of victims who have been badly let down who need to consider their future car. 

'Anyone who was a victim of Savile should be looked after properly.

'I have never even had a written apology.The amounts are absolutely abysmal. It is a bloody insult. Some victims have to pay fortheir own counselling.

'We are being made to feel guilty for asking for compensation by people who do not know what they are talking about.

'I have to think twice before Iput the heating on or have a meal and I just don’t think we should have to do that.

'The Government was partly responsible for Jimmy Savile and for that reason they should damn well look after us.

'The Government did not care hoot about the victims and have just paid lip service to the Jimmy Savile situation.'
