The BBC is to auction off the props, costumes and furniture from some of its best-loved programmes.

Entire sets from the flagship children’s show Blue Peter, costumes from hit crime drama Ashes To Ashes and incredible props from Doctor Who and Red Dwarf are among the prized items up for grabs from tomorrow.

The Corporation is selling more than 1,200 lots which have a strong connection with Television Centre – the iconic West London building which was the BBC’s home until  earlier this year.

Up for grabs: The BBC is to auction off the props, costumes and furniture from some of its best-loved programmes. It includes  two fake fur coats worn by DI Alex Drake, played by Keeley Hawes, pictured, in Ashes To Ashes

With no reserves set, auctioneers expect a huge demand from viewers eager to secure their own slice of television history.

BBC bosses hope that by offering fans such an eclectic mix of items –including photographs, programme awards, sound recordings and paintings – they will be able to cater for every pocket.

Proceeds from the sales will go into Corporation funds.

Get ahead: Sci-fi fans are well catered for with one of the heads worn by Kryten, the robotic manservant from Red Dwarf, up for grabs

Some items are expected to attract 
fierce bidding. For example, what man could resist the overcoat worn by 
maverick cop DCI Gene Hunt, played by Philip Glenister in retro-crime 
drama Ashes To Ashes?

But a huge ‘Totaliser’ from the 2010 Blue Peter Christmas appeal might look a little out of place in most living rooms, especially as it comes as a job lot with the kennels that were once home to Blue Peter dogs Petra, Patch and Shep.

Sci-fi fans are well catered for and 
props include the head of one of  the deadly Sycorax monsters from 
Doctor Who, a replica of Star Wars droid R2-D2 and one of the heads worn
 by Kryten, the robotic manservant from Red Dwarf.

Doctor Who devotees can also bid for a cut-out Dalek used to publicise the hit show.

Other
 costumes from Ashes To Ashes include two fake fur coats worn by DI Alex
 Drake, played by Keeley Hawes, and a leather jacket sported by DS Ray 
Carling (Dean Andrews).

Several of the costumes, including a 
blood-stained top and jacket worn by officer Sharon ‘Shaz’ Granger 
(Montserrat Lombard) and the bullet-riddled tunic of ill-fated DC Chris 
Skelton (Marshall Lancaster), are linked to key plotlines in the show 
which ran from 2008 until 2010.

Blue Peter fans of all ages will spot 
familiar props spanning generations of the show first screened in 1958 
and now broadcast from the BBC’s Salford base.

They include the sail-shaped backdrops 
that became a distinctive part of the set in 2004 and the bright orange,
 blue and  purple sofas used by presenters including Gethin Jones and 
Konnie Huq in 2007.

Other items from children’s shows include the trademark purple van from CBBC programme Prank Patrol and a set used by  CBeebies presenters when anchoring the channel’s programmes.

The sale also includes a demonic bloodstained head from a 1990 French and Saunders sketch which parodied The Exorcist, and a man-nequin used by Catherine Tate when she transformed herself into her foul-mouthed ‘Nan’ character.

There are huge cardboard publicity 
cut-outs of some of the BBC’s best-known personalities including 
Strictly Come Dancing’s Bruce  Forsyth and Tess Daly.

Also under the hammer are hundreds of vinyl singles of sound effects, such as hyenas, battle tanks, sea lions, thunder and even ‘traffic in a French city’.

Elizabeth Sewell, of auctioneer Peaker Pattinson which is running the sale, described it as ‘a chance for the public to buy a little bit of  TV history’.

‘I’m sure the cardboard cut-outs of Brucie and Tess and the Blue Peter sets will get people bidding,’ she said. ‘We’re expecting interest from all over the world. It’s impossible to put a value on most of the props because they are one-offs.’
