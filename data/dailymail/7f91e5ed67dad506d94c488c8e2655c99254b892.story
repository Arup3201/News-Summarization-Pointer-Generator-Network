St Louis news anchor April Simpson looked less than impressed on Monday when her colleagues surprised her live on air with a visit from the McDonald's mascot she had been compared to

The joke goes back to a stripey top that Simpson had worn in a 2013 newscast when he co-host had jokingly called her The Hamburglar

A video of the clip has been viewed more than a million times on YouTube and made into countless memes.

In the clip, which fired aired in February 2013, Ezell called Simpson as The Hamburglar because of her black and white stripey top.  

The recent success of the video, which was also discussed on The Talk, inspired Simpson's colleagues at FOX 2 News to have the McDonald's mascot pay her a visit live on air on Monday's 9AM show.

Once again Simpson looked less than impressed when she was approached by The Hamburglar as a colleague explained the set-up.  

'This is not funny. I'm just letting you all know,' said Simpson as her colleagues laughed and giggled.

Later she seemed to soften her stance when she retweeted stories about the video and wrote: 'I don't look amused but I really was.'

The joke became an internet sensation after Kevin Hart shared the original clip on Facebook and countless memes soon appeared online
