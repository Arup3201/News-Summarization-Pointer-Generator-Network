It should have been a piece of cake.

But this was the hilarious result when a studio photographer tried to get a toddler to smash a cake to mark his first birthday.

Instead of happily getting messy, little Josh Holford did everything but and spent an hour crawling around the studio.

Studio photographer Bradley Lever and young Josh Holford created a hilarious video of his latest shoot, where it took him more than an hour to persuade the toddler to destroy his first birthday cake

Photographer Bradley Lever and Josh’s mother Nikole patiently kept picking him up and putting him next to the cake.

But no matter how many times they did it the wilful toddler flatly refused to do as he was told and get messy with the bright blue iced sponge. 

The youngster eventually ended up covered in some of the cake, although he didn’t fully demolish it as planned.

But Bradley turned the session into a funny time-lapse video which is now going viral.

Nikole, 26, said: 'I’ve known Bradley for years, and he took some pictures of Josh when he was just five days old, so for his first birthday, we wanted to do something special.

'Bradley said he’d done a couple of shoots of toddlers smashing cakes, and said they made brilliant photos, so I said "go for it."

'The bright blue cake looked gorgeous and delicious, but Josh was having none of it.

'It was the first time he had had cake, and he just didn’t like it.

'He was more interested in everything else in the studio rather than the cake itself, which is strange, because he loves getting messy when he eats.

'It was funny more than anything, and Bradley really does have the patience of a saint.'

Speaking about the shoot, Bradley said: 'We persevered, dealt with tears and tantrums and in the end I think we managed to get some really nice shots'

Bradley, who runs Blinc Photography in East Grinstead, East Sussex, came up with the idea of shooting children bashing cakes after seeing pictures of messy babies.

The photographer, who also works in marketing, has been doing photography for the last ten years, but reckons little Josh was his most trying client.

Bradley, 30, said: 'I’m a patient man, but Josh tested me to almost the limit.

'For more than an hour we tried every way possible to get him interested in smashing the cake, but he was just not in the mood.

'Usually, when shooting young children you normally have about a 20-minute window before they get bored.

'Josh, on the other hand, gave me about 20 seconds of his attention before becoming bored and crawled off.

'We persevered, dealt with tears and tantrums and in the end I think we managed to get some really nice shots.'

The concept started in the US, but it is slowly making its way over here. Some kids have sat down and not left the cake until it is completely gone - but not Josh

He added: 'I specialise in things like weddings and baby portraits, and the big one at the moment is definitely the cake smash.

'The concept started in the US, but it is slowly making its way over here. Some kids have sat down and not left the cake until it is completely gone.

'But Joshua had other ideas - he seemed to crawl pretty everywhere except towards the cake.

'I used toys, funny voices, silly faces, and everything else I could think of, but he just wasn’t interested.

'They do say "never work with children or animals" but it was such a good laugh I’d happily do it again.'

Nikole said she was a bit mortified because Josh wasn't doing what he was told, but took into account that he is only one year old

Nikole, a trainee accountant, lives in East Grinstead with property developer partner Craig Holford, 29, and their one-year-old son.

She added: 'I was a bit mortified because Josh wasn’t doing what he was told, but he is only one year old.

'Bradley was fantastic. It was the first time Josh had ever had cake, and he just really didn’t want to play with it.

'We’ll definitely remember this for a long time, and no doubt embarrass Josh with the pictures in a few years’ time.'
