Fabian Delph has admitted his Aston Villa teammates were shocked when he told them he was signing a new deal at the club.

The 25-year-old put pen to paper on a new four-and-a-half deal to end speculation he would leave the club on a free transfer this summer.

Liverpool and Tottenham were believed to have been tracking his situation given his previous contract was up at the end of this season.

Delph's performances this season have led to a first England call up from Roy Hodgson

Chief executive Tom Fox said lots of clubs had expressed an interest in Delph, who could have left for a knock-down fee this Janaury.

And Delph conceded: ‘The lads are absolutely delighted. As soon as I told some of them they looked at me shocked to start with.

‘They see a lot in me in how I want to go about my career how dedicated I am and how I want to push on.

‘They’re delighted to keep someone like me here. I see them as family, brothers, I’d run through a brick wall for them. They’re not just teammates.’

Delph also paid tribute to his manager Paul Lambert and said he did not need to talk with Roy Hodgson about how staying at Villa might impact his England chances.

‘I got into the England squad playing for this great club. Hopefully I can keep my spot,’ he said. 'I spoke to my family, I spoke to Tom. I didn’t feel like I needed to speak to Roy about it. It was about not rushing it.’

Delph had been linked with clubs including Liverpool and Tottenham during the January window

On Lambert he added: ‘I’ve had a great relationship with the manager since I’ve been here. I was only training twice a week when he came in. I wasn’t hitting the best potential. He’s got me training every day.

‘I’ll be in his office for 40 minutes speaking to him about how I can improve my game and hurt the opposition more. I’m really confident about the future and what’s going on here.’

Fox added: ‘There were a lot of interested clubs. We’ve got a top young player here. The top five clubs are in a much better place financially.’
