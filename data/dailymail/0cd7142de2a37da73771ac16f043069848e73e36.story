What a night to remember for Tottenham's Harry Kane in their resounding Group C Europa League victory against Asteras Tripolis on Thursday night.

The striker scored a hat-trick as Mauricio Pochettino's side recorded their first win in the competition with a thumping 5-1 triumph at White Hart Lane.

The 21-year-old endeared himself to the Spurs faithful even further when he volunteered himself to go in goal following Hugo Lloris' dismissal in the closing stages of the match.

With the hosts having made all their substitutes, Kane was soon left to rue that decision as he let Jeronimo Barrales' tame free-kick slip under his grasp and trickle into the bottom corner of the goal.

Any regular goalkeeper would have expected to make a routine save, but despite Kane's comical error he was ironically cheered by the Tottenham faithful who had witnessed a performance of promise from the England Under 21 star.

'It was a great night until I went in goal,' he told ITV4 in his post-match interview afterwards.

'In fairness I think I'll leave that to the keepers from now on [on his error to concede Asteras' consolation goal]. It was a great result for us, a great win, and obviously I'm happy to get the hat-trick.'

Kane's magic night began in the 13th minute when he unleashed a blistering right-footed drive from 25-yards out that nestled into the bottom right-hand corner of  Tomas Kosicky's goal.

The strike was similar to the 21-year-old's opener against Besiktas in Tottenham's last Europa League encounter and the effort provided the platform for a flurry of goals for the hosts.

After two sublime goals from Erik Lamela, Kane was on the score sheet again with a close-range tap in after Kosicky had spilled Moussa Dembele's stinging drive, to make the score 4-0.

Just minutes later the Tottenham academy graduate completed his first hat-trick for the club heading home Federico Fazio's cross to take home the match ball.

Reflecting on his three goals, Kane added: 'It [the first] was a sweet strike. When it left the foot I knew it had a chance and fortunately it came of the post and went in which is always nice.

'I thought it was good to get the second and third as well, extra goals when the team is dead on their feet and when we want to start killing off teams and getting the five goals was great.'

He's evidently better at scoring goals than keeping them out, but on current form the 21-year-old is pressing his claim for a starting birth in Pochettino's Premier League team.

Kane has now scored six goals in nine appearances for the club this season and with Spurs at home to Newcastle next in the Premier League - he'll be looking to add to his tally if given the chance on Sunday.

Despite his comical goalkeeping error Kane was pleased with a display that saw him collect the match ball
