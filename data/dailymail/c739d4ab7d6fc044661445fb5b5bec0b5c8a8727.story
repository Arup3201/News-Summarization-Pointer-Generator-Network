Weather officials in Albuquerque say a mysterious presence that showed up on its radar the last few nights has turned out to be of the insect variety.

A mysterious green formation showed up on the National Weather Service's radar that looked to be rain.

It was no storm, but a swarm of grasshoppers over Albuquerque's West Mesa for the fourth night in a row on Friday.

Insect swarm: The grasshoppers showed up as a green cloud on radars, prompting technicians to check they were still functioning in the absence of any rain

Meteorologist Chuck Jones says the swarm got caught up in winds heading southwest and is being carried as high as 1,000 feet, well above the height of the city's tallest buildings.

Jones says the grasshoppers likely hatched weeks ago and are now grown, leading to their ability to trigger radar images.

Officials say last year's monsoon season and a drier winter created the ideal environment for the grasshoppers to hatch.

There wasn't enough rain to kill the eggs so they all hatched, creating the worst infestation in 20 years.

Infestation: A garage door is covered in the insects, which hatched in record numbers because of a dry winter

Biblical proportions: Albuquerque residents will have to put up with the bugs until they move on

Technicians initially thought their equipment was malfunctioning when they saw several unexplained clusters.

'We really thought that our radar was broke,' Brent Wachter, a forecaster from the National Weather Service told ABC News.

'So we sent our technicians out there a couple of times and we couldn't find anything wrong so we had to call the National Radar Depot in Oklahoma.'

Some citizens want the state to spray insecticides for the insects, but John R. Garlisch, extension agent at Bernalillo County Cooperative Extension Service says it will be ineffective.

'It is a nuisance to people because they fly into people’s faces while walking, running, and biking. They are hopping into people’s homes and garages, they splatter the windshield and car grill while driving, and they will eat people’s plants,'  Garlisch told ABC News, but that 'this, too, shall pass.'

It was actually a huge swarm of grasshoppers

Due to a dry winter, many more grasshoppers have hatched than usual - the most in 20 years

There isn't anything the state can do about it - residents must wait until they move on
