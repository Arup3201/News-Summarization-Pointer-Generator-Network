Fiona-Natasha Syms took to Twitter to defend her husband Robert who she is separated from

She'd put up with the late nights, the endless phone calls and the jam-packed diary.

So when Fiona-Natasha Syms discovered her MP husband had been sacked from his job by David Cameron, she was far from impressed.

While Robert Syms took the news ‘like a man’ and maintained a dignified silence, she was a little less gracious – and vented her spleen on Twitter.

Unleashing a series of extraordinary messages, she declared herself ‘beyond furious’ that he had been thrown out of his job as a Government whip.

The Tory’s estranged wife wrote: ‘PM just fired father of my kids over the phone. Gave up chairmanship of a cttee [committee] to be a whip, worked hard and was widely acknowledged to be a good whip. He was utterly gracious and took it like a man, I am beyond furious. Loyalty counted for nothing.’

Then she said the Poole MP had been treated so appallingly that he would be justified in becoming a party rebel, allying with backbenchers such as Sarah Wollaston and Adam Afriyie.

At the weekend, Mr Afriyie called for an in-out EU vote in 2014, three years earlier than Mr Cameron wants.

Mrs Syms, 44, wrote that ‘luckily for Dave’, her ex-husband would ‘continue to be super loyal’, adding: ‘I’d be fixing up drinks with Afriyie, Crouch, Wollaston, Norman. No not really.’

She went on to joke about the couple’s young children Imogen and Nicholas defecting to Labour.

Mr Syms then seemingly intervened and she posted: ‘Have politely been told to zip it and stop lioness-ing. Shall put out the rubbish instead. Hopefully that’s not news.’

Robert Syms had been a whip – an MP 
charged with ensuring backbenchers vote the right way in the Commons – 
before yesterday afternoon the Prime Minister rang him up to tell him 
his services were no longer required.

Mrs Syms, who describes herself as
 an ‘over-Tweeter’, still uses her ex-husband’s surname despite the fact
 they separated in early 2006. They are not divorced.

She
 told her 644 followers on Twitter she still supported Mr Cameron, but 
wrote ‘today is for raging’.

Mr Syms, 57, had been a whip with 
responsibility for the Home Office and the Department for Energy and 
Climate Change since 2012.

Before he was elected to Parliament in 1997, 
he was boss of a plant hire company.

His
 estranged wife had obviously not expected the sacking, because earlier 
in the day she had been enthusiastically tweeting about other reshuffle 
changes, even writing: ‘Wake me up if Mr Syms is running the country’.

Last night, outside her West London home, Mrs Syms said: ‘I don’t want to give any interviews.’
