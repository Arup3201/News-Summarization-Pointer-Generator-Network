Key elements of the Highway Code are to be re-written to stop driverless cars bringing gridlock to Britain's city centres, the official Government review into self-drive vehicles will announce tomorrow. 

But the re-write will also serve to allow groups of cars and lorries to run far closer together in 'convoys' or 'platoons' with separation gaps between automated vehicles just a fraction of the recommend spaces between automated vehicles compared to those with drivers.

Rules on tailgating may need to be removed entirely to enable the driverless cars to run almost nose to tail –taking up less road-space, reducing jams an improving fuel efficiency thanks to on-board sensors that can act with far more precision than a human driver.

A Whitehall insider said: 'It seems likely that the introduction of driverless cars wil in due course necessitate changes to regulations, to common practice and to conventions governing the interaction of road-users.'

Other parts of the Highway Code are on course to be relaxed because driverless cars can pass other vehicles with greater precision. 

So recommended passing distances to cyclists and pedestrians may have to be changed to prevent self-driving vehicles clogging up highways across the country.

Under the existing Highway Code, drivers overtaking cyclists are expected to leave as much room as they would leave for a car. The official review into driverless cars, to be published on Wednesday, will confirm that the Highway Code will need to be reviewed.

On Saturday the Daily Mail revealed exclusively that ministers would give the green light to trials on public roads of the new vehicles which will not require a licence to drive. Insurance costs could be slashed because the machines are less likely to make an error, say experts.

Transport minister Claire Perry said recently: 'Driver and human error is reported to account for over 90per cent of traffic incidents, and so it is clear that driverless cars will make a huge difference.

'Using the technology to manage traffic flows on trunk roads will smooth traffic flows and reduce the stop/start of congestion, which will, in turn, reduce emissions and improve fuel consumption.' 

She added: 'We are also looking at 'platooning' of heavy goods vehicles on the trunk road network. I am sure you will know that platooning is the electronic coupling of vehicles to run in close formation. By allowing vehicles to run closer together, the government recognises the potential fuel and carbon savings, reduced congestion by creating more efficient use of the network, and reduced road casualties by eliminating driver error from accidents.'

Graham Parkhurst, head of an academic research programme in Bristol and part of one of three official pilot programmes, said: 'If everyone obeyed exactly what it said in the Highways Code, the roads would probably grind to a halt. If we ask driverless vehicles to respect every aspect of the Highway Code we will quickly discover that some things would be unworkable.' 

The Government's major six month feasibility study into the practical, safety and legal issues surrounding the autonomous 'robo-cars' will conclude that there is 'no barrier to testing driverless technology on UK roads' from this summer. 

It paves the way for the first proper tests on British highways of vehicles that drive themselves amid other cars and real traffic.

Until now the technology has only been trialled on private land or specialist test facilities.

But in a move that puts the Government on course to fulfil its ambition to make the UK the world centre for self-driving vehicles – and draw in lucrative foreign research investment - the report will advise that 'The UK is well placed to lead the development of driverless technology.' 

The report is expected to distinguish between 'highly automated cars' fitted with steering wheels and pedals in which motorists will be expected to take control at any time, and 'fully' automated cars, where a licence will not be required because they are essentially a passenger in 'a car which is capable of operating on the road network without hman intervention.' In this case 'a driver need not be able and ready to assume control.'

Drivers of highly automated cars could still face prosecution and penalties for mobile phone use, failure to wear a seatbelt and eating at the wheel
