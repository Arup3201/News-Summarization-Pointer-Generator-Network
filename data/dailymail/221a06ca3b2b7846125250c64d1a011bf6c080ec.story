Her slender new figure is the envy of many after she lost four stone on a strict diet.

But the Duchess of York may have been trying a little too hard to show it off yesterday – when she donned this daring ‘sexy Santa’ costume for a party.

Sarah Ferguson, 55, was spotted showing off her slim-line legs in the racy outfit as she celebrated Christmas with friends and family.

Slender: The duchess, 55, was seen chatting with male guests at the pub in Surrey while wearing a Santa outfit

As well as a fur-trimmed mini-dress and matching hat, she also sported a pair of high-heeled knee-high brown suede boots.

The duchess was at the Fox and Hounds in Englefield Green, Surrey, with ex-husband Prince Andrew, 54, and daughter Princess Beatrice, 26.

Beatrice dressed as a giant Christmas pudding, complete with white icing and holly decoration.

Meanwhile, her mother chatted to locals and enjoyed the attention of two young men wearing novelty hats.

Slimline: The duchess recently lost more three stone after spending time at a boot camp in Swiss ski resort Verbier while also undertaking a strict new diet

She and Andrew, who sat at a table with friends in the pub's restaurant, relaxed as they enjoyed the live show.

A source at the party told the Sunday Mirror: ‘No one was expecting royalty to drop in but it was just an incredible night.

‘Fergie looked fantastic and it was obvious she has a new-found confidence.

The duchess recently underwent a strict dieting regime and boot camp in Swiss resort Verbier.

The former WeightWatchers spokeswoman has told of her decision to shed the pounds ‘before the age of 55’ after her weight ballooned to 16 stone.

The source added: ‘Andrew and Fergie were singing along to the entertainment and they were dancing to the music. It was a real royal shindig.’

The couple divorced in 1996 but have remained close.

The Prince recently revealed that he remained friends with his former wife 'more for family than anything else'.

The royal spoke about the couple's split and continued friendship in a candid interview with US satellite TV channel CNBC.
