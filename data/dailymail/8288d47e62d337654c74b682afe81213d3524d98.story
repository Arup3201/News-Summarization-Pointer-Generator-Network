He  is one of Australia's most notorious murderers, torturing and killing 10 people in a bloody spree for which he has never shown remorse.

But now Snowtown serial killer Robert Wagner has made an astonishing appeal for 'female friends' to write to him in the cell at Yatala Labour Prison, in South Australia, where he is serving ten life sentences with no chance of parole.

'Hi, my name is Robert and I'm looking for females to write to,' the 42-year-old states on the website PrisonPenPals.com. 'Feel free to ask me anything and I'll reply as honestly as possible.'

The Department of Correctional Services have asked for his profile to be taken down, according to Adelaide Now. 

The serial killer's profile on the Prison Pen Pals website, in which Robert Wagner seeks to exchanging 'interesting mail' with females. Wagner, one of Australia's worst ever murderers writes 'Feel free to ask me anything and I'll reply as honestly as possible.'

In a statement issued to the newspaper, officials said that they are also monitoring his mail to intercept any correspondence elicited by the online ad.

'No prisoner in South Australia is permitted Internet access and any prisoner profile listed on this or similar sites would have been created by someone external to the correctional facility,' they said.

'The Department first and foremost has a duty of care to victims of crime and does not condone the activities of the prisoner pal website in question.'

It is believed a friend on the outside has set up the account for Wagner, on the US-based website that connects prisoners with people on the outside.

Wagner met John Bunting, the ringleader of the Snowtown murders, in 1991. They committed their first murder the next year and went on killing until 1999.

One of the victims was Wagner's former lover, homosexual cross dresser Barry Lane with whom he was in a relationship from 1985 until around 1996. They had begun seeing each other when Wagner was 14 and Lane was 31.

Wagner tortured and strangled Lane in 1997.

The photograph was taken when the jury in the bodies-in-the-barrels trial visited the small town for the trial.

The bodies of the victims were stored in barrels and the gang moved the bodies numerous times, keeping the mutilated remains in places including a shed behind Bunting's house and in a Toyota Land Cruiser in Adelaide Plains.

In 1999, eight dismembered bodies were found in six barrels in a disused bank vault in Snowtown, a small town 145km north of Adelaide.

Wagner was convicted of ten of the killings in December 2003 when he was 31 and became one of a small group of criminals including backpacker murders killer Ivan Milat, serial sex killer Peter Dupas and Port Arthur gunman Martin Bryant who will never have the chance of parole. 

In the most gruesome evidence, jurors heard that he and Bunting had fried and eaten their final victim's flesh.

Sentencing, Justice Brian Martin stated that the men were 'in the business of killing for pleasure' and 'incapable of true rehabilitation.' 

Robert Wagner stored dismembered bodies in barrels at the back of a 4wd in the driveway of this home in Snowtown. The bodies were found when the barrel's were transferred to a bank vault for storage.

The trial was the longest trial in Australian criminal history. Three jurors walked away, unable to stomach the disturbing evidence.

Prosecutor Wendy Abraham, QC, told the jury than 'enjoyment' was a motive in the murders.

'Mr Bunting and My Wagner bragged - they laughed about what they were doing,' Ms Abraham told the court.

The jury in the Snowtown Murder trial was shown a poem, believed to be written by Robert Wagner whilst in custody to a fellow prisoner.

The disturbing poem, dated August 2000, is written in childish handwriting, explaining how he has 'provided a service' to the community because 'our street should be weeded.'

'I will not ever be held in contempt, for everyone knows my time was well spent,' the poem says, revealing the disturbing mindset of a deranged killer with no remorse.
