Leeds did it under Don Revie; Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United side did it; Atletico Madrid under Diego Simeone do it. Many great sides have hounded and harassed referees over the years. It’s a characteristic at times of their determination to win and their unity.

So when Chelsea surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers to get Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off on Wednesday it wasn’t something new, or a modern phenomenon that has been creeping up on us. It has nothing to do with foreign players and managers coming into the game. It’s been a part of English football for years.

Having said that, now is the time to draw a line and punish teams that overstep the mark in this way, as I believe Chelsea did on Wednesday and I think it could be done with a simple amendment to the rules.

Almost all the Chelsea squad surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers after an incident at Stamford Bridge

If a referee feels that he is being aggressively hounded by a group of players he should have the power to reverse the decision and award the free kick the other way. So on Wednesday night, he could still have sent off Ibrahimovic if he really felt it was a red card offence but Chelsea would have lost the advantage of a free kick.

It wouldn’t immediately cut out hounding refs but it would be a nudge in the right direction. Behaviour only changes if managers are encouraged to discipline their players. At the moment, it’s worthwhile clamouring round a referee to get a decision, so few coaches would discourage their players from doing so. However, if you felt that by hounding the referee, your team might lose a potential goal-scoring opportunity, because you would miss out on a free kick on the edge of the box, managers would soon start telling their players to exercise more restraint.

And over-zealous appealing for penalties would stop pretty quickly. Imagine losing the chance to take a penalty kick because you had surrounded the referee. The manager would be furious. Referees are only human. Kuipers might have looked at the Ibrahimovic tackle and thought it was a 50-50 decision. But when you have 38,000 people screaming for the red card and then you have a group of players around demanding it too, all of that activity around him might make him feel it’s a 90 per cent decision.

This tackle from PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic sparked a furious reaction from Chelsea players

This would only be a small change in the rules but I believe it would make a massive change in behaviour over time. Certainly managers wouldn’t encourage their team to attempt to influence the referee in that way anymore because there would be an immediate punishment which could cost the team. It gives the referee a little bit more power and it would act as powerful disincentive.

You could also apply the same rule of reversing the free kick if a player showed an imaginary card, trying to get an opponent booked or sent off. That would soon end what is an unsavoury practice. Another area which needs looking at is when a player marches towards a referee in an aggressive manner, forcing the referee to back off.

It’s natural for players to complain when they feel aggrieved and when emotions are running high. But what is important is that we establish that exclusion zone around the referee where players won’t encroach. If someone is to complain, they can do so backing away from the referee, getting into position, not moving towards him. And if someone does need to go to referee, it should only be the captain. And when complaining they should show some respect for the personal space of the referee.

Football is a physical game and that is part of its spectacle. I’ve no desire to curb the aggression of players when it’s directed in the right way.

But referees need to be protected and their personal space needs to be almost sacrosanct. It’s important to draw a line and clearly state what is and isn’t acceptable.

WHEN FRIDAY COMES, ENGLISH TEAMS CAN FEEL BENEFIT IN EUROPE 

It has been an awful few weeks for English teams in Europe with only Everton thriving in the Europa League.

Given the competitiveness of the Premier League you would imagine that our teams would be more than ready for this stage of the Champions League and Europa League, when the competitions step up a level.

But the reverse seems to happening. The sheer competitiveness of the Premier League is leaving us short in these difficult games. Not only do we tend to have four teams who believe they can win the title, which is not the case in most of Europe’s other major leagues, but there is an increased level of intensity about all our games.

Everton are progressing well in the Europa League as other English sides continue to struggle in Europe

Having played in France, I know that for Paris Saint-Germain, Marseille and Lyon there will only be a handful of games for which they need to be at their best.

It’s not that it’s easy but going to the smaller French teams is not like going to Turf Moor to play Burnley or Loftus Road to play QPR, where the crowd is right on top of you and everyone is expecting the home side to put one over Chelsea or Manchester United.

That’s not the case in France, and I’m not sure it is in Italy or Spain. Obviously Bayern Munich are utterly dominant in Germany at the moment, so there aren’t that many games where they need to be at the top level. Don’t forget that while our teams were playing five games in two weeks over Christmas, Bayern, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke were on a 40-day break.

Arsenal endured a torrid Champions League 3-0 defeat against Monaco late last month

And while the Christmas break isn’t as long in France, Italy and Spain, it allows their players to relax get a couple of weeks in the sun.

It’s ironic that the intensity and competitiveness of the Premier League, which is what has made it so successful, might now be damaging our performance in Europe and by extension damaging it’s reputation.

However, there is an opportunity now to help English team in the Champions League. Jose Mourinho has long drawn attention to Spanish teams playing games on a Friday night if they have a Tuesday night Champions League game.

The new £5.1billion TV deal — a mark of how popular the Premier League is — has provision for some Friday night games. The Premier League and TV companies should be looking at those Friday night games to see whether they can schedule teams competing in the Champions League.

We need to give our teams every chance we can. After all, if Premier League clubs consistently fail in Europe, global audiences will begin to question just how good these clubs really are.

GREAT TO LOOK BACK AT MY CAREER

I was really honoured a few months ago when Sky Sports asked if I would be the subject of a documentary covering my life in football.

The result will be shown tonight on Sky Sports 1 and it’s been a trip down memory lane for me and a chance to reflect on my career.

There are one or two things I hadn’t remembered, like the post-match interview I did after scoring on my league debut as an 18-year-old against Stoke in 1976.

The collars on the shirt I was wearing — oh my word! They look like something Barry White might have turned down as excessive.

And I’m pleased to say my Top of the Pops appearance singing Diamond Lights gets an outing — not that any of the musicians will be.

It also gave me a chance to take another look at my favourite goal, the volley I scored for Tottenham against Manchester United from just inside the box in 1979.

I’ve never taken drugs in my life but the feeling I had that day, with the adrenalin pumping through my body after scoring, is how I imagine it feels. I hope people enjoy watching the film as much as I did making it.
