The second day of Royal Ascot got off to a stylish start with bold blooms, chic black and white and striking floral prints all challenging for dominance in the style stakes.

But even the bright floral prints couldn't compete with the sea of spectacularly large hats that flooded Royal Ascot - with even the Queen plumping for a pretty mint green, purple and pale pink Angela Kelly creation, worn with a mint green crepe coat and a multi-coloured floral silk dress by Peter Enrione, and a diamond and emerald brooch.

Once again the monarch looked on jaunty form as she arrived for the second day at the races, again accompanied by her eldest son Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall.

But not everyone was enjoying the day. Along with bookmakers who were forced to pay out on multiple colours for the second day in a row, racegoer Tracey Rose was left miserable after being ejected from the Royal Enclosure by Ascot's fashion police.

Lovely: The Queen looked summery with a floral print lilac blouse beneath her green coat, while the Countess of Wessex chose a striking nude and cerise hat

Stunning: Viscountess Serena Linley arrived on the arm of her husband, David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley, while Lady Helen Taylor was bold in brights

Glamorous
 in green: Both the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall plumped for 
verdant shades, which Her Majesty livened up with a vibrant pink, purple
 and green hat

Striking:
 Former heptathlete Denise Lewis was pretty in an austere black and 
white ensemble but jazzed things up with a huge pair of jet and gold 
drop earrings

Applause:
 Racegoers cheered as the Queen was driven past the Grandstand before 
she alighted with the Prince of Wales at the Royal Enclosure

Out! A furious Tracey Rose was evicted from the Royal Enclosure by the Ascot fashion police because of her too-short skirt

Racegoers traditionally have a punt on the colour of the hat she will wear on Ladies' Day, being staged tomorrow, when female racegoers wear even more outlandish hats and outfits then usual.

Bookmaker Coral believes she will wear a blue hat and makes the colour its 3-1 favourite.

But punters have been backing purple and its odds have fallen from 8-1 to 5-1.

The 52-year-old milliner was left furious after her skirt was deemed too short and branded Ascot staff 'rude' and called the decision 'preposterous' as she left.

Yesterday fellow milliner David Schilling was also thrown out for wearing unbecoming headgear after he tried to sneak in wearing a gargantuan floral wreath underneath his top hat.

One who made a more delicate choice was the Duchess of Cornwall whose cream hat was pretty when teamed with
 an on-trend pea green coat worn over a floral print tea dress. Her 
husband meanwhile, looked dapper in a grey suit enlivened with a lilac 
silk tie and waistcoat.

The Countess of Wessex also put in an
 appearance, watching the parade from the Royal Box and sporting a 
wonderful nude and cerise straw hat, which was stylishly combined with a
 knee-length wrap dress.

Lady Helen Taylor, meanwhile, decided
 that more was more when it came to colour and chose an ensemble that 
combined a violet and yellow dress with a bright turquoise blue hat.

While Viscountess Serena Linley was 
flying the flag for elegant neutrals as she arrived on the arm of her 
husband David, former heptathlete Denise Lewis was stunning in stark 
black and white, and there was no shortage of style in the paddock.

Stylish:
 Racegoer Eleanor Matthews was stunning in a spectacular multi-layered 
fascinator which combined two of Ascot's top trends: monochrome and big 
blooms

While
 many plumped for bright crimson, yellow and cerise, cobalt and royal 
blue topped the colour charts - perhaps inspired by the Queen whose 
favourite colour it is.

Others,
 meanwhile, plumped for prints with delicate blooms proving the most 
popular. Dance group, the Tootsie Rollers, appeared for a second day, 
this time in gorgeous yellow rose print dresses and buttercup boleros, 
topped off with wonderful sunflower splashed hats.

Already a dominant trend on day two, 
big blooms were splashed around the racecourse on day one as well. Among
 the most successful interpretations were the huge floral headpieces, 
including one that resembled a fuchsia bush.

Yesterday's event also saw the royals joined by a succession of celebrities including Welsh soprano, Katherine Jenkins, who chose a bold orange dress and Phillip Treacy hat, and Andy Murray's girlfriend, Kim Sears, who was spotted in a £155 Whistles dress and LK Bennett shoes.

Others to appear on day one included veteran racing pundit, John McCririck, Gary Lineker's wife Danielle, who looked gorgeous in a pale pink lace dress and Bollywood megastar, Aishwarya Rai, who was elegant in monochrome.

Like the royals and celebrities in attendance, the majority of racegoers chose elegant looks in line with Ascot's strict style rules, which include a ban on strapless dresses, sheer clothing and any form of fancy dress.

Yesterday, milliner and sculptor David Schilling fell foul of the Ascot fashion police after attempting to make his way onto the racecourse sporting a huge floral wreath underneath his top hat.

And he wasn't the only one to attempt to bend the style rules. From giant comedy hats to too-short skirts and sky high platform heels, some Royal Ascot racegoers appear to need a recap of the Ascot style rules.
