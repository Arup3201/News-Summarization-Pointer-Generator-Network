Most of us are guilty of letting rolls of camera film to languish forgotten in drawers.

But this camera's owner surely takes the prize for being the most forgetful photographer.

Atmospheric photos offering a snapshot into life in post-war Britain have been discovered on a vintage camera that has survived against the odds for sixty years.

The find was made by Emma Jacks of Southend, Essex, when she snapped up an old Rex camera which had been donated to a charity shop in her home town.

After splashing out a measly £3 for the camera, she was intrigued to find it still held an undeveloped film.

The 23-year-old took the camera to a local company who warned her that it was highly unlikely that any pictures would even survive the development process.

But Emma was thrilled when she returned to find that six black and white images dating back to the early 1950s had survived.

Although some of the photos from the roll of film were too blurry to see, the six remaining provide a nostalgic flashback of how life was in post Second World War Britain.

And what makes Emma’s find even more special is the fact that an undeveloped film left on a camera normally survives a maximum of 20 years before it is rendered useless.

The pictures feature a couple enjoying a day out in the countryside, smiling as they pose for the picture.

Another image shows a young boy of about eight - most probably the couple’s son - stood in shorts and a polo neck shirt.

Rolling green fields, undisturbed skylines and a village watching a bicycle race portray an idyllic, quiet life - one that is a far cry from the urban lifestyles many lead today.

The photos were taken in the Essex area as one picture shows Southend Pier.

Now Emma hopes that she might be able to trace the young boy who she hopes will still be alive today, believing he would now be retired.

She said: 'When I took the camera home from the charity shop I saw there was a roll of exposed film so I put it in for developing.

'The developers were very dubious about whether anything would still be on there and the chap said ‘I doubt anything will come out due to its age but let’s give it a go’.

'I was just interested to see if anything would come out and amazingly six really clear pictures were on there.

'I don’t know who was more surprised, me or the man from the shop. Snappy Snaps, Southend'

In a bid to trace the people in the photos Emma posted two of them on Twitter.

And although no-one has come forward yet, a local historian came back to her to say that the photos, based on the fashions as well as the houses in one of the images, date back to the early 1950s.

Two of the images show a bike race in action- one with four young men lined up at the start whilst the other is captured mid-race.

The final photo is of two cows stood in a field.

Emma added: 'The one of the bike race has the most historical information in it because you can see the council homes in the background and can see what people were wearing at the time.

'But, I am really hoping that the little boy might still be alive today and will get in touch when he sees the pictures, that really would be lovely - he would be into his 60s by now. It would be amazing to hear from him.'

Emma, who works as a digital retoucher on modern photos, has a large collection of vintage cameras.
