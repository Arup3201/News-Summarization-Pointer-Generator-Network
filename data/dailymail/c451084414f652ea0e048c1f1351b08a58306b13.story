England have dropped two places to No 15 in the latest FIFA world rankings while recent continental cup winners Ivory Coast and Australia were the biggest movers. 

After a disastrous World Cup, Roy Hodgson's side have fallen despite winning all four of their Euro 2016 qualifiers against Switzerland, San Marino, Estonia and Slovenia as well as international friendlies against Scotland and Norway.

With rankings based on results over the last four years, England have been usurped by World Cup surprise package Costa Rica who held the Three Lions to a goalless draw at the the tournament before winning Group D. 

Although they have only played out a 3-3 friendly with Uruguay since the World Cup, Costa Rica have climbed three places and now lead the CONCACAF nations.
