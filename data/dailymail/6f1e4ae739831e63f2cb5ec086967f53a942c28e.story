Scam: Pauline Elfreda Barrett, 55, swindled £1.3m from the oil and tax giant she worked for

A payroll officer carried out an elaborate tax scam to swindle £1.3 million from the oil and gas giant she worked for.

Pauline Elfreda Barrett, 55, convinced her bosses to cough up for thousands of pounds in fabricated tax bills in a shocking betrayal of trust.

Barrett, of Ashford, Kent, doctored incoming emails from the firm's accountants, making it appear they were demands for payment from HMRC. 

Bosses at Saipem Limited – part of Italian giant Eni – would then approve the payments, with Barrett funnelling the funds into her own account.

A judge heard how, between November 2010 and September 2014, she made at least 28 payments to her account in this way totalling £1.3m.

The court was told that she was a trusted employee at the Kingston-based firm.

Detective Sergeant Mick Walker from the Metropolitan Police said: 'For four years, Barrett abused her position. Her theft was calculated. 

'She first made demands for small sums of money as she wanted to test the water.

'As her confidence grew, so did her demands. The largest payment she fabricated was for around £80,000.'

Barrett was told at Kingston Crown Court that she faces jail after admitting one count of fraud by abuse of position. She will be sentenced on Friday.
