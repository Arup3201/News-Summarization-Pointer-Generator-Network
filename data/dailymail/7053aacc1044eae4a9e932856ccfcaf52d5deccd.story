The first human trials of a new Ebola vaccine are today underway, the latest step in attempts to halt the spread of the virus in West Africa.

Scientists at Oxford University have immunised the first healthy volunteers with a new drug, which they hope will protect people against the disease.

The World Health Organisation said today more than 8,100 people have now lost their lives to the virus, the majority in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

In September a separate trial was launched at the university, to test the effects of another potential vaccine. 

The Oxford Vaccine Group, part of the University of Oxford Department of Paediatrics, aims to have vaccinated 72 healthy adult volunteers by the end of this month.

Oxford University scientists have begun immunising healthy volunteers in a trial of a new experimental Ebola vaccine. They hope to immunise 72 adults by the end of the month

The study involves a 'prime-boost' vaccine regime, meaning volunteers are given a first 'prime' injection to stimulate an initial immune response.

Two months later they are given an additional booster injection, intended to enhance the body's immune response.

The trial organisers stressed the vaccine does not contain any replicating virus, so it cannot cause anyone to be infected with Ebola.

The immune responses that the vaccine generates – both antibodies and T cells – will also be measured over a period of one year.

The new Ebola vaccine is being trialled by the Oxford Vaccine Group.

They aim to have vaccinated 72 healthy adult volunteers, aged 18 - 50, by the end of this month.

Previous trials showed the vaccine was successful in protecting primates against the Kikwit Zaire strain of Ebola – which is similar to the virus causing the current outbreak in Western Africa.

The strain has a mortality rate of up to 90 per cent, according to the World Health Organisation. 

The trial's main objective is to test the vaccine's safety, and to test in which order the two vaccine components should be given in a prime-boost regime, and how far apart.

Developers of the drug, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, have now accelerated the trial due to the continued spread of Ebola in West Africa.

Since its outbreak the killer disease has claimed more than 8,000 lives across Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.

Further studies of this vaccine are being planned for the United States and in Africa early next year.

Dr Matthew Snape, from the Oxford Vaccine Group, said: 'We aim to immunise all participants within a month; the main aim is to understand the safety profile of the vaccines.

'The devastating Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone continues to see hundreds of new cases each week and has placed a huge burden on these countries' infrastructures.

'While public health measures are currently still the best way to bring the outbreak under control, if we have a safe and effective vaccine it could begin to have an impact later this year.

'That is the goal that is seeing manufacturers, public health bodies and research regulators come together to accelerate the first clinical trials of new Ebola vaccines.'

The trial starting today follows another trial launched in September last year, also based in Oxford.

The results are due this month

The trial beginning today is part of a series of safety trials of potential Ebola vaccines aimed at preventing the disease.

In September, a trial of another Ebola vaccine developed by GSK/US National Institutes of Health (NIH) began. 

This vaccine used a single Ebola virus protein to generate an immune response, but similarly could not cause anyone to become infected with Ebola as it didn't contain infectious virus material.

The trial vaccinated 60 healthy volunteers and initial results are expected this month.

A third Ebola vaccine being developed by the biotech company NewLink Genetics will also soon be trialled, as well as others in development in Russia. 

Dr Snape said the more vaccines being trialled, the better.

He said: 'The fact that there are at least three Ebola vaccines entering these early safety trials is good news.

'We are not playing first past the post here. Having multiple vaccines progressing through clinical trials increases the likelihood of vaccine manufacturers having the capacity to meet production demands should mass immunisation be required.

'The more vaccines and more manufacturers there are working on this, the better.'

The trial comes as the Ebola screening system at UK airports has been toughened up after a British nurse who later developed the virus was waived through.

Ms Cafferkey is fighting for her life after being diagnosed with Ebola last Monday, after five weeks in Sierra Leone

Nurse Pauline Cafferkey, 39, is fighting for her life after being diagnosed with Ebola last Monday having spent five weeks treating victims in Sierra Leone.

It later emerged that officials at Heathrow had allowed her to board a connecting flight to Glasgow even though she had complained of a fever.

UK Health secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday announced that officials had introduced more rigorous checks for doctors and nurses returning to the UK following volunteer work.

Until recently, the screening only involved them having their temperature taken and filling-in a questionnaire about whether they have come into contact with patients.

But from now on, anyone who thinks they are mildly unwell will be kept on and made to undergo further checks even if their temperature seems normal.

Officials will also seek advice from tropical disease experts and monitor the patient closely for a number of hours.

Ms Cafferkey, from Glasgow, remains in a critical but stable state at a special isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in North London.
