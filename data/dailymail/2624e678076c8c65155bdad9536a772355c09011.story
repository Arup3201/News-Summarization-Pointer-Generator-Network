Oprah Winfrey is selling Harpo Studios in Chicago to a developer for $32 million, it has been revealed, as she also puts her home in the city on the market.

Winfrey filmed 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' at the studio from 1990 to 2011, when she ended the talk show to start the Oprah Winfrey Network on cable.

'We have entered into a purchasing agreement with Sterling Bay for the four-building Harpo Studios campus in Chicago's West Loop,' Harpo told Crain's Chicago Business in a statement.

However, the studio will remain on the property for another two years.

Leaving town: Winfrey is selling Harpo Studios in Chicago to a developer, but the studio will remain on the property for another two years. Harpo Inc. said in a statement that it has entered into a purchasing agreement with Sterling Bay Cos. for the four-building campus on Chicago's West Side

'We expect the transaction to be closed in 30 days. The property will be leased back to Harpo for two years and the studio will continue to produce programming for OWN.'

Winfrey filmed The Oprah Winfrey Show at the studio from 1990 to 2011, when she ended the talk show to start the Oprah Winfrey Network on cable.

About 200 people work at the 3.5-acre campus, which will sell for about $32 million, Crain's reported Sunday. Harpo said it expects to close the transaction in 30 days.

For Ms. Winfrey, selling off the last of her commercial real estate represents a final step out of Chicago, which she left almost three years ago to form Oprah Winfrey Network in Los Angeles.

Television history: Winfrey moved to Harpo Studios in 1990 after finding success as the host of A.M. Chicago in 1984. Her show stayed and only grew in popularity before it ended in 2011

As Ms. Winfrey cuts her last remaining business ties to Chicago, she still has a 9,625-square-foot condominium in Water Tower Place listed for sale at $7.75 million.

Winfrey first came to Chicago in 1984 to WLS-TV's morning talk show, 'A.M. Chicago.' A month later, the show was No. 1 in the market and renamed 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' in 1985.

Winfrey moved to Harpo Studios in 1990 and is credited with transforming the once-gritty industrial area to a neighborhood filled with families and trendy restaurants.

In 2011, then-Chicago Mayor Richard Daley named the street outside Harpo Studios 'Oprah Winfrey Way.'
