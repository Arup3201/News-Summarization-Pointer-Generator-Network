The billionaire Prince of Dubai is planning to construct a new 16-bedroom lodge in the Scottish Highlands, right next to his current 14-bedroom holiday home.

Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al-Maktoum has applied for planning permission to add to the existing luxury buildings on his 63,000-acre estate in Inverinate in Wester Ross.

The 65-year-old sheikh's architects have submitted plans for the 'modern hunting lodge' which includes an interconnected swimming pool, gym and leisure facilities. There are also plans to install seven satellite dishes on the estate.

He has owned Inverinate Estate for more than 20 years, and visits every year in the summer for several weeks to escape Dubai's heat, which can reach 50C temperatures.

Sheikh Mohammed is well-liked within the community, and is regarded as a generous landlord. He built Inverinate and Loch Duich Community Centre and also gifted land for a day care centre and eight sheltered houses for elderly people at Dornie.

Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell, who lives around three miles from Sheikh Mohammed's Highland residence, said she could not comment on the application as she was a planning committee member. 

However, she said the family had brought many benefits to the area. 'Sheikh Mohammed is a very good landlord to the community,' said Cllr Campbell.

'When we were trying to do up the hall he stepped in and financed it and when we were trying desperately to find provision for elderly people after Graham House in Dornie closed, he gifted land for a daycare centre and eight sheltered houses.

'He's very well regarded in the community. He employs 12 people full-time on Inverinate Estate and when he visits there are lots of other people taken on to help cater for the family. He was up recently with friends - he loves the area and walking in the hills.'

The submitted plans are more extravagant than a previous application for a 16-bedroom house approved in 2009, despite being recommended for refusal by planners who said the design was 'more akin to a development found in business parks'. 

The design statement submitted by his agents, KJ Architects Ltd, said they planned to use locally sourced materials. 

'The planning permission for the new lodge at Inverinate is for a modern, contemporary, interpretation of a hunting lodge which was designed to contrast and supplement the existing lodge without resorting to pastiche or mimicry,' it reads.

'There will be no impact on either individual or community residential amenity, while the building will bring significant benefits to the local community through employment both during construction and for housekeeping/maintenance staff and so on after completion, including increased local spend.'

Wealth: The UAE royal family receive around £1bn a year from the country's oil reserves.

Sheikh Mohammed, a billionaire and a renowned racehorse breeder, has a great love of poetry and has penned his own collection, Poems from the Desert.

The emir of Dubai's younger brother is prime minister and vice-president of the United Arab Emirates. The fabulously wealthy family receive around £1bn a year from the country's oil reserves.

Highland Council is currently consulting on the planning application which will be determined within the next few weeks.
