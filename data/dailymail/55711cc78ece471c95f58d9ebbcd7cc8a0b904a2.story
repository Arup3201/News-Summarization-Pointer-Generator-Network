It is the perfect time of year to spot the Aurora Borealis in Iceland. But holidaymakers heading north could be in for a double treat this year thanks to its erupting volcano.

The Bardarbunga eruption began in August, prompting spectacular images of the molten lava.

But one photographer has gone a step further and captured the volcano glowing by night as the Northern Lights put on a celestial display above.

Now holiday company Off The Map Travel, which snapped the spectacular picture, says this could be the perfect winter to catch both the Aurora Borealis and see a volcanic eruption up-close.

Jonny Cooper, Northern Lights expert and founder of Off the Map Travel said: 'This is a truly spectacular night time display of colour with the glow of the emerging lava being framed by the Northern Lights.'

'Although it is unclear how long the volcano will continue to flow, there is a genuine opportunity for those who visit in October to witness this incredible event.'

'With such a strong start to the year for the Northern Lights, the combination of the eruption and such strong aurora displays may not be seen again for a long time,' he added.

The company is offering six-night trips to take in both the Northern Lights and the glowing volcano from £999 per person.
