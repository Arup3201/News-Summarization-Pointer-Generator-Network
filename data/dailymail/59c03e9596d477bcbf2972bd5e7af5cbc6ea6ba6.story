Lampard has moved quickly to resolve his future following his release from Stamford Bridge this summer after 13 years at the club.

After signing for newly-formed MLS side New York city on a two-year deal, he was keen to keep himself fit before the start of their new season in March, so jumped at the chance of remaining in the Premier League with City.

The veteran midfielder will provide City with a different option in midfield until then, with his goals per game ratio something manager Manuel Pellegrini will look to utilise over the coming months.
