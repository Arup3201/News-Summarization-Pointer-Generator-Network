Samantha Power may be the United States' youngest ever ambassador to the UN, but the constant battle to balance diapers and diplomacy means the mother-of-two walks the tightrope between keeping the peace around the world and at home every day.

Power, 43, opened the doors to her grace-and-favor apartment on the 42nd floor of the Waldorf Towers on Park Avenue to the Today show as she revealed to Savannah Guthrie her daily struggle to bring her 'A-game' to work and for her 4-year-old son, Declan and one-year-old daughter, Rian.

'You never feel like you're ... bringing your A-game to everything at the same time. So something gives,' Power confessed. 'And you know, those who say that nothing gives have mastered cloning, I think ...

'And I can feel, you know, even when we leave in the morning just a level of clinginess and, ‘Are you really coming home? Are you really?’ You know, the other day (my son) said, 'No more security council resolutions.’

Giving the Today crew a tour around her lavish apartment, Power offered them fascinating insights into how the one-time journalist, Pullitzer prize winner and Harvard human rights campaigner acts like any other mother when she comes home after a bruising day of negotiations.

Insisting on feeding little Rian herself as she sits in her high chair, Power, who came to the United States at the age of nine with her parents from Ireland juggles her stressful life with her husband, famed legal scholar Cass Sunstein.

He is currently the Robert Walmsley University Professor and Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and the age difference between the two is 16 years.

Before that, Sunstein actively worked with the Obama administration as the Administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.

Trying to give her children as normal an upbringing as possible is difficult when the school run is done in an armoured SUV, accompanied by a personal security detail on the streets of Manhattan.

Named as 'one of our country's leading foreign policy thinkers' when named as his choice as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nation's in August, President Obama called her a 'long time champion of human rights and dignity.'

She won a Pulitzer Prize for her 2002 book 'A Problem From Hell: America and the Age of Genocide.'

Originally a freelance reporter in Bosnia, Power was a journalist who wrote for The Washington Post, The Economist, U.S. News & World Report and other news outlets.

Her work captured the-then Senator Obama's attention and he managed to persuade her to give up her Harvard job and come to work for him.

'Indentured servitude, I think,' joked Power who quickly added that as a native Bostonian she gave up an even greater sacrifice.

'I had just gotten a slice for the first time in years of season tickets in a Red Sox package, basically, which are impossible to get,' she said.

Having agreed to work for Obama during a dinner meeting, Power revealed that she knew then, that her tickets were a goner.

'Three hours in, I heard myself saying, you know, ‘Why don't I move to Washington and basically do whatever you'll have me do in your office?’” she said.

'And it was only when I left the dinner an hour or two later that I realized that I was, in effect, giving up my season tickets claim for this man.'

Indeed, her devotion to Barack Obama the politician caused her massive problems when as his senior foreign policy advisor during his first presidential campaign she was quoted in a British newspaper as calling then-opponent Hillary Clinton, a 'monster'.

She was removed from the campaign.

However, recalled to the president's team and now a part of the administration, Power described how she made an emotional apology to Clinton.

'You lose your temper and you're in a campaign and things go back and forth. But it just completely broke my heart,' she said. 

In the Field: Samantha Power was formerly a Pullitzer Prize winner and traveled extensively

'There is a fair amount of negativity heaped upon her that I find massively unfair. And the idea that I could have contributed in some way to that narrative, that was terrible.

'I have regretted it pretty much every day since,' she said.As the United States' representative on the 15-member Security Council, Power has been leading the way to secure the removal of all chemical weapons from Syria.

'We wouldn't even be in this discussion about getting rid of Syria's chemical weapons if not for the credible threat of military force,' Power said.

'President Obama has not taken that threat off the table. I think Russia is aware that that threat still exists. Syria's aware that threat still exists.'
