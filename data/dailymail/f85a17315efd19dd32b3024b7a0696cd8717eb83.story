Fascino Rustico booked his ticket for the Betfair Hurdle on Saturday week with an easy victory at Newcastle in the Robert Kirkland Blyth Ltd Novices' Hurdle on Wednesday

Sent off the 11-8 second-favourite against John Ferguson's Zip Top, a former classy Flat horse and a good winner last time out, he was well in command at the finish.

Always highly regarded, the John Hales-owned seven-year-old is now with trainer Dan Skelton having been with Paul Nicholls.

While the market leader made several mistakes at his hurdles, Fascino Rustico jumped with aplomb under Harry Skelton and came away after the last to beat the favourite by nine lengths.

Betfred cut the winner to 12-1 from 16s for the valuable Newbury race.

'He'll go to Newbury now,' said Skelton. He was fine immediately after the race and as long as he's good for the next week or so he'll run.

'The 5lb penalty he'll get for winning we needed actually as I don't think he'd have got in the race otherwise.

'He's take time to mature but Paul always thought a fair bit of him.

'Paul was unlucky not to win with him but it meant he was still a novice for us.

'I'm just very lucky to get a horse as good as him and I'm very grateful to John for sending him to me.

'He has plenty of size and scope but I'm in no rush to send him chasing.'

The rest of the card was dominated by a resurgent Donald McCain, who saddled a treble.

Beeves (3-1) was first to strike in the Complete Building Services Handicap Chase in a slow-motion finish, holding off Little Glenshee.

Stable jockey Jason Maguire was delayed, though, meaning Wilson Renwick took the mount.

Maguire arrived in time to partner Up And Go (15-8 favourite) in the North Sea Logistics Novices' Handicap Chase.

Once a promising type, and the conqueror of Many Clouds over hurdles, this was at least a step back in the right direction.

Lovely Job (9-1) was a game winner of the M&C Roofing Maiden Hurdle for McCain and Maguire, just holding off Glinockie.

The duo were also represented by the favourite Mahler Lad in the closing bumper who had beaten a couple of subsequent Willie Mullins bumper winner in his only point-to-point but was struggling some way out before staying on for third.

Impressive winner Captain Chaos (4-1) represented Tim Fitzgerald and Andrew Tinkler.

It was also a day 10lb claimer Ryan Nichol will never forget as he rode his first winner on Lucinda Russell's Amore Mio (4-1) in the J Barbour & Sons Conditional Jockeys' Training Series Handicap Hurdle.
