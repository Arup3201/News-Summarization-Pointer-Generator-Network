Top police officers are in line for inflation busting pay rises of up to ten per cent.

The bump could be worth up to £18,000 a year for Chief Constables at a time when the starting salary for a Constable was cut by £4,000 to £19,000.

The fall of a fifth left starting salaries at the same level they were a decade ago and less than a trainee manager at McDonald’s. and sparked fury among rank-and-file officers.

Both changes were among recommendations from the overhaul of pay and conditions proposed by former rail regulator Tom Winsor.

Starting salaries for new police recruits have dropped £4,000 to £19,000, while top officers could get £18,000 more. File picture

Last night Steve Williams, chair of the Police Federation, said: ‘At a time when police budgets are being slashed and police pay is being reformed to the detriment of serving officers, we are amazed that PCCs will have the budget available to increase the salary of Chief Constables by 10 per cent.’

Coming months will see the appointment of top officers in around a quarter of forces, as incumbents retire or move to new jobs.

Many were temporary appointments in advance of the elections for Police and Crime Commissioners last year.

Last week Nick Gargan, former head of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) was appointed as to head the Avon and Somerset force.

Yesterday acting Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Police Shaun Sawyer was appointed to fill the job on a permanent basis.

The new pay regulation, signed off by Home Secretary Theresa May, will allow PCCs to vary the existing starting salaries for Chief Constables by up to ten per cent.

The pay levels for senior officers are set according to the size of the force they are commanding. At the top end are the West Midlands and Greater Manchester forces which came with a starting salary of £181,455 in 2010.

The West Yorkshire chief earns £169,359 and Merseyside and Northumbria chiefs £157,260.

Salaries are then staggered down to the lowest level, £130,044 for five smaller forces, including Gloucestershire, Lincolnshire and Warwickshire.

The Home Office said it was right for PCCs to be given the ‘flexibility’ to change salaries, which they would have to account for to the electorate.

The new arrangements for new recruits will see those with no experience seeing their starting salary cut by 17 per cent.

Recruits with experience, such as those who have volunteered as a special constable, can earn up to £22,000 a year.

Mrs May is yet to decide whether to accept another Winsor recommendation that would allow chiefs to sack under-performing officers.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘PCCs have been elected by the people to hold the police to account and it is only right they are given some flexibility on employing chief constables.

‘That is why independent reviewer Tom Winsor recommended chief officer basic pay could be raised or lowered by up to 10per cent when PCCs are recruiting new chief constables.

‘Our police reforms are introducing modern management practices at all levels of policing, giving the added flexibility required to forge a force fit for the 21st century.’
