Row: Boris Johnson has weighed in on the conflict on the 100th anniversary of WWI backing Michael Gove's theory that it was sparked by German expansionism

David Cameron and Boris Johnson rode to Michael Gove’s defence over his call to banish the ‘left-wing myths’ of the First World War depicted on shows like Blackadder.

Downing Street said the Education Secretary was right to blame German militarism for the outbreak of the war, while the London Mayor joined him in condemning the Left.

But Mr Gove found himself exposed to a counter attack as Nick Clegg and a Cambridge academic he has condemned, embarked on a new round of hostilities.

The Deputy Prime Minister said the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of war should be a time for ‘sombre reflection’, not ‘wagging the finger of blame’.

And Professor Sir Richard Evans, Regius Professor of History at Cambridge, said Mr Gove ‘should be ashamed of himself’.

The row began last week when the Mail ran an article by Mr Gove in which he argued that the First World War was every bit as ‘just’ as the fight against Hitler.

He criticised the Blackadder and Oh! What a Lovely War view of the war ‘as a misbegotten shambles’, as well as ‘left-wing academics all too happy to feed those myths by attacking Britain’s role in the conflict’.

He singled out Sir Richard, accusing him of ‘adopting the attitude of an undergraduate cynic’.

At the weekend, Labour education spokesman and historian Tristram Hunt branded it an ‘ugly’ attempt to ‘politicise’ the centenary commemorations.

But Boris Johnson yesterday called for Mr Hunt to quit, saying: ‘It is a sad but undeniable fact that the First World War, in all its murderous horror, was overwhelmingly the result of German expansionism and aggression.

‘If Tristram Hunt seriously denies German militarism was at the root of the First World War, he is not fit to do his job, either in opposition or in government, and should resign.’

David Cameron’s official spokesman also backed Mr Gove.

He said the 100th anniversary is an opportunity to ‘commemorate the fallen’ and reflect on ‘peace in Europe’.

The spokesman said: ‘I think we can do that without being afraid of saying it was right for Britain to respond to aggression and to enter the war on that basis.’

But Mr Clegg, who has repeatedly clashed with Mr Gove, suggested the Education Secretary should have kept his thoughts to himself.

The Lib Dem leader said: ‘I don’t think anyone sensible is saying you should airbrush out history. It’s the question about whether you think this is the occasion to start apportioning blame or wagging the finger.

Conflict: Gove has come under fire from Nick Clegg who said this is the time for 'sombre reflection'

‘I think most people want a slightly more sombre and sensible reflection about what wars on that scale mean, how we, particularly in Europe, have overcome that.’

On Sunday, Sir Tony Robinson, who played Private Baldrick in Blackadder Goes Forth, described Mr Gove’s comments as a ‘very, very silly mistake’.

Professor Evans accused Mr Gove of a ‘personal attack’. He points out right-wing historians like Niall  Ferguson and former Tory MP Alan Clark – who alluded to the phrase ‘lions led by donkeys’ for the  soldiers and their generals – have also condemned the war.

He added: ‘Defaming historians and others who think and write  critically about Britain’s role in the First World War by accusing them of seeking to “denigrate virtues such as patriotism, honour, and courage” is no way to conduct the debate Gove says he wants to encourage. He should be ashamed of himself.’
