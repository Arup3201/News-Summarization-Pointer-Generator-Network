An 18-year-old girl, whose body was found stuffed in a suitcase in a Colorado park, died from a drug overdose.

The Mesa County Coroner's Office reported that Kelly Mae Myers died of a 'mixed drug intoxication'. 

They said they have not yet determined the circumstances surrounding her death.

Myers' body was found in Cactus Park, Mesa County on February 28. The teenager had been missing since December 18.

Colorado police ruled her death as 'suspicious' but have not yet officially declared it a homicide.

Officials said they would not release any more information regarding Myters' cause of death at this time because of the ongoing investigation, according to Fox 13 Now.

Myers' body was put inside a suitcase and kept in a West Valley City hotel before it was transported to the Cactus Park area, a search warrant obtained by The Deseret News revealed. 

Police are currently investigating two persons of interest, Eduardo De La Cruz and Raymond Cordova,  in connection with Myers' disappearance.

De La Cruz, 30, is being held on suspicion of trafficking heroin but is not an official suspect in the Myers case, police said.

Myers' body was found stuffed in a suitcase at Cactus Park in Mesa County, Colorado, on February 28, two months after police believe the teen died at a West Valley City hotel 

He was the alleged ringleader in a drug trafficking organization that supplied 'large quantities of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and prescription narcotics'.

De La Cruz was named as a person of interest in the Myers case following a wiretap investigation.

Myers was last seen in Grand Junction with friends and was believed to be heading to Salt Lake City for a party. 

Relatives who reported her missing in Colorado said the teenager's disappearance was 'out of character'.

Myers' mother Kim Lee told Fox 13 Now she had never heard of De La Cruz or Cordova before they were arrested. 

'This wasn't just a piece of trash that you stuffed, and I hate saying that word, but you put in a suitcase,' she said. 

'This was a human being, this was my daughter.'   

Cordova, 47, an associate of De La Cruz, picked Myers up from her father's house, a police affidavit stated.

Myers was an avid Facebook user and last logged onto the site on December 19. Investigators believe she died sometime that day. 

Her IP address was traced to the Country Inn and Suites Hotel in West Valley City. 

De La Cruz had checked into the hotel the day Myers is believed to have died, police say.

An informant told police Myers' body was placed in a black suitcase with a 'hard shell' and that he got into a car with Cordova and the suitcase, according to The Deseret News.  

He said there was a 'foul odor coming from within'.

They then drove to Cactus Park and disposed of the suitcase, the affidavit states.

On February 23, detectives met with the head housekeeper of the Country Inn & Suites. 

She described 'smelling a very strong and pungent smell' coming from the room De La Cruz had rented in December. 

The housekeeper added that it smelled 'as if someone did not wash their feet or socks for several months', the affidavit states.

Cordova remained in the Mesa County Jail for investigation of drug-related charges.

Myers  had numerous alleged drug arrests related to methamphetamine and police initially believed she had fled Colorado for Utah.

Police also believed she may have tried to hitchhike to Salt Lake City.

A search team was not sent out for the teenager until January 19.

'Investigators believe she has friends or known associates in the Salt Lake City area, and may have been trying to get there,' police said in a statement at the time.  

Myers went missing December 18, when family thought she had hitchhiked to friends in Utah
