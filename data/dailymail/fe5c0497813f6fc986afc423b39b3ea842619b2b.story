Older women never tire of hearing the tick-tock of the biological clock which is supposed to ruin their chances of having a healthy baby, but a new study reveals babies born to mothers aged over 40 can have better physical and emotional well-being.

And with a host of celebrities giving birth in their forties, researchers from Birkbeck University of London and University College London have highlighted a growing trend in their study on older mothers.

Singer Gwen Stefani, 44, gave birth to a baby boy called Apollo Bowie Flynn Rossdale in February this year, while actress Halle Berry, 47, gave birth to her latest child Maceo last year.

Researchers from from Birkbeck University of London and University College London assessed children of women older than 40, like singer Gwen Stefani who had her third child at 43, and compared them with those born to younger mothers in their twenties

Uma Thurman meanwhile didn't plan on having any more children after the two children she had with ex-husband Ethan Hawke, until she met new man Arpas Busson. They welcomed their daughter Luna into the world when the actress was 42.

Researchers assessed children of women older than 40 and compared them with those born to younger mothers in their twenties.

While they might tire their mothers out and be harder to catch – the research suggests children born to mothers over 40 are healthier.

The study revealed mothers who give birth over the age of 40 were less likely to have sickly children. Halle Berry, 47, gave birth to her latest child Maceo last year

The study concluded that children of older mothers were 22 percent less likely to accidentally injure themselves and nearly a third less likely to be admitted to hospital by the age of three.

The offspring of older women are also more likely to have better emotional well-being as the likelihood of conflict between parent and child was found to decrease as the maternal age increased.

And language development by the ages of three and four was also better for the children of older mothers.

The number of women over the age of 40 having a baby has increased more than fourfold in the last 30 years, figures from the Office of National Statistics show.

In 1982 there were 6,519 live births in England and Wales to women aged 40 or more, about 1 percent of all babies born that year.

By 2012 the figure had risen to 29,994, or 4.1% of all live births.

Actress Uma Thurman welcomed baby Luna into the world when she was 42. The average age of mothers in England Wales has reached an all time high of 30

And the average age of mothers having babies has now reached 30 – the highest ever recorded.

Professor Jacqueline Barnes, one of the study leaders, of Birkbeck, said the project was based on the fact that the maternal age was rising.

She said: ‘It has demonstrated that, while there are many medical reasons why close attention should be given to the physical well-being of older mothers and their infants both during pregnancy and immediately after birth, an increase in older motherhood should not necessarily be a cause for concern in relation to subsequent parenting.

‘Indeed, it is likely that older mothers will be preparing their children well for preschool and then school experiences in a warm and responsive home environment.

‘The findings of fewer unintentional injuries and fewer socio-emotional problems with increasing maternal age may suggest that women with more life experiences are able to draw upon a wider range of support that can help to reduce some of the stress of parenting.’
