One cheeky Los Angeles band has pulled the wool over Spotify's eyes with a cheeky if not brilliant stunt that netted them $20,000 for uploading nothing but dead air to the popular streaming service.

The indie outfit Vulfpeck managed to raise some much-needed recording funds without so much as producing a single genuine second of music after figuring out a way to game Spotify.

Vulfpeck uploaded an 'album' called Sleepify - 10 silent tracks that all run just over 30 seconds, the required threshold from Spotify to classify something as a song.

And here's where the money comes in: for every song streamed by a user on Spotify, the artist earns 0.007 cents.

Hoorah! Vulpeck managed to score $20,000 from Spotify in silent streams

The band explains the maths behind the stunt, which nets $0.007 in royalties for each stream

Spotify eventually shut down the band's prank but laughed it off saying: 'We prefer Vulfpeck's earlier albums'

Apparently Vulfpeck have some loyal fans, because they 'listened' to Sleepify by the thousands and followed the ban's instructions to stream it - on repeat - while they slept. Fans were even promised free tickets to 'The Sleepify Tour'. 

Cheeky, indeed - but the so-called album brought in $20,000. Until Spotify clued in.

Vulfpeck were forced to pull the album, obviously, and Spotify seemed to take the incident in fairly good spirits.

'It's a clever stunt but we prefer Vulfpeck's earlier albums,' Spotify spokesman Graham James told Billboard.

According to Vice the band hasn't been paid yet but they're optimistic because Spotify's payments usually come through after two months.

Vulfpeck bandmember Jack Stratton said: 'My guess is we will.'

There's a tour? The band promised fans a free ticket to their tour if they participated in the stunt

Considering they're $20,000 better off for doing nothing, you'd think they'd look a little happier

In the meantime they may have stumbled upon another brilliant idea. Vulfpeck have issued an 'apology' album entitled Official Statements, CNN reports.

The track lengths? Just over 30 seconds.

'The gist of it was that, while they enjoyed Sleepify and thought it was funny and clever, that it violated their terms of content,' Stratton says on the first track.

'So I don't know what's going to happen with it - it's very uncertain at the moment.

'And in light of that uncertainly I want to take 30 seconds silence to ponder the uncertainty.'
