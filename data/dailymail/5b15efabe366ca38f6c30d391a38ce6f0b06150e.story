Alex Jones is in no doubt: stepping on to the Strictly dancefloor is guaranteed to give you sweaty palms and a racing heart. ‘Being on that dancefloor on Saturday night in front of the studio audience is one of the most terrifying things I’ve ever done,’ she says. And it doesn’t seem to get any easier.

Several weeks into the competition, and despite talking to Weekend fresh from performing a beautifully executed waltz that won praise from the judges, she’s still full of trepidation.

‘It was lovely to get some good comments but as soon as we go back to Latin I predict a dip.’ Her anxiety is understandable: The One Show presenter performed a distinctly underwhelming cha cha cha with her dance partner, James Jordan, on her first week on the show.

‘It was a disaster,’ she says. ‘I was like a rabbit caught in headlights. I had to have a word with myself afterwards and say, “Alex, get a grip.”’ Like many Strictly competitors, the 34- year-old is only just realising the extent to which Strictly requires not only physical but also emotional dedication. ‘People warn you how tough it is,’ she says. ‘Matt said, “It’ll take over your life.” But until you do it you have no idea how much.’

Matt, of course, is her 33-year-old One Show co-host Matt Baker, a graduate of the Strictly class of 2010. He reached the final and is proving a sounding-board, advice guru and potential partner to practise with. It is, Alex says, ‘only a matter of time’ before he squires her around the One Show studio. In fact, watching her co-host go through his Strictly paces last year was the main spur to taking part.

‘I always said if I was ever going to do that type of show, it’d be Strictly. Matt’s experience sealed the deal. I knew how much he’d enjoyed it. I also thought, “It’s good for our show, for our relationship.”’ Ah yes, their relationship. It’s nearly a year now since Matt joined Alex on The One Show, after their predecessors Christine Bleakley and Adrian Chiles’s muchpublicised (some would say catastrophic) move to ITV to launch Daybreak.

On screen chemistry: Matt and Alex on The One Show

The onscreen chemistry between Christine and Adrian had set tongues wagging – though both denied an affair – and helped take The One Show to great heights, attracting audiences of more than five million. By 2009, however, viewing figures were dwindling, dropping below four million.

A combined pay packet of £10million was too good to turn down, and Christine and Adrian finally jumped ship to ITV. For that sort of money, ITV must have been expecting TV gold – instead they got Daybreak, which is currently pulling in just 700,000 viewers, less than half the audience of its rival, BBC Breakfast.

It hasn’t all been plain sailing at The One Show, either. When Alex, then a presenter on Welsh language channel S4C, was announced as the new female host she was dubbed a ‘Christine clone’ who lacked experience. Her male co-presenter, Jason Manford, meanwhile, resigned after just a few months after confessing to dubious online chats behind his wife’s back, and was replaced by Matt.

And in September, more than 400 viewers complained about the behaviour of a dog trainer who appeared on the show, claiming he had been too aggressive towards a Jack Russell. But ratings these days are buoyant, averaging five million, and the Christine and Adrian era seems a distant memory.

‘It’s definitely been a rocky time but now it feels really secure, really solid,’ says Matt. Alex adds, ‘It seems to have just worked. And you can’t force that – if you try too hard it’s just awful. We wanted it to come naturally, especially as in the past the show has had a turbulent ride. Now it’s, well, settled.’

So settled, in fact, that guests are often struck by how laid-back they are on set – it’s been remarked that they come across like a happily married couple. ‘We’re always chatting away so it’d be quite easy for us to go on air without realising,’ says Matt. ‘Des O’Connor came on and he said, “Well, you two are incredibly relaxed; you just seem to be making this up.” We’re not but I guess it can appear like that.’

But for his part, he likes the show best when they’re doing something gritty. ‘We did some stuff with the riots that I was really proud of,’ he says. ‘We had a lot of victims who came on, we’d gone out on to the street to find them and I’d like to do more of that kind of reporting.’

Matt is also doing his best to calm his 
co-host’s nerves on the dancefloor. Alex admits she was left downhearted
 by her first performance, labelled ‘starchy’ by judge Craig Revel 
Horwood.

‘I felt a bit defeated before we got anywhere near the studio,’ she admits. ‘I remember James saying, “Pat my shoulder when you hear the strongest beat in the bar,” at our first meeting, and I couldn’t do it. He said, “Oh, God,” and I thought, “This is terrible.”

Later, James admitted he was horrified when he saw me dancing because he didn’t think I’d be that bad. He said, “Just ask Matt – he’ll show you how to do it.”’

Matt certainly had natural flair, but he’s so busy with a new challenge now that he has little time for dance coaching: as you read this he is in training for Children In Need – he’s going to ride a rickshaw from Edinburgh to London with a different passenger for each leg of the journey. Today, he is sore after months in the saddle, yet still says, ‘I probably haven’t done enough preparation.’

At least he’s not expected to do the cycling wearing little more than two tiny pieces of cloth held together by dental floss, like Strictly’s female competitors. ‘Yes, I’ve worn more coming out of the shower than I did on the launch show, I felt completely naked,’ confesses Alex. ‘But people like to see you being a bit different.’

She’s only worried about impressing one 
man, anyway – a chap she’ll name only as Charlie, who she met through a 
friend and has been dating for the past five months. ‘He’s lovely. He’s 
from New Zealand and wasn’t aware of The One Show when we met. It’s 
going well, but he has nothing to do with the media, so I don’t want to 
say too much, to save him embarrassment with his friends and 
colleagues.’

You can understand her caution, having already seen the break-up of two long-term relationships, both with television types: shortly before she started on The One Show in August last year, her relationship with her boyfriend of seven years, presenter Matt Johnson, ended, while before that she had dated Steve Jones, front man on the US X Factor, for three years.

It can’t be easy, of course, watching your beloved entwined with someone else. Some of the moves in Strictly are so steamy they should be X-rated. ‘I don’t envy anybody’s partner,’ Alex admits. ‘But Charlie said to me, “If I even have a hint that you’re worrying about what I think, I’ll be really annoyed.”’

Matt had the same conversation with his physiotherapist wife Nicola, 33, mother of his two children, Luke, four, and two-year-old Molly. ‘Nicola was brilliant,’ he says. ‘She said at the start, “If you’re not going to give it everything, don’t bother doing it at all.”’

Alex describes reporting for her One Show duties each evening following Strictly rehearsals as ‘like putting on a comfy pair of shoes. At the moment it’s a lovely contrast.’ The word ‘contrast’ is just the prompt her co-host needs for a spot of mickey-taking.

‘When you take part in Strictly, you get more and more tanned as the weeks go by. So I’ve asked the producers to introduce a split-screen format,’ he says. ‘That way we can just lower the contrast slightly on Alex’sside, for equilibrium.’ Equilibrium, of course, being a cherished asset on The One Show these days – one that its presenters are, no doubt, praying will last.
