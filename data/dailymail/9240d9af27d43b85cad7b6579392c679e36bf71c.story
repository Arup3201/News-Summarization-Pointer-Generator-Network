An imposing stately home has sold for £16million for just the second time in its 650-year history.

A wealthy farmer is set to call Shakenhurst Estate home after he forked out for the stunning Grade II listed mansion set in 1,324 acres of English countryside.

On top of the 12-bedroom house, the estate comes with 15 farmhouses and cottages, almost three miles of trout fishing and a high-quality shoot.

Sold: Shakenhurst Estate on the border between Worcestershire and Shropshire has sold for £16million

Grand: The imposing estate, which spans 1,324 acres of English countryside, has sold for only the second time in its 650-year history

New home: A wealthy farming family, the Staddons from North Devon, have snapped up the stunning property and are set to call the sprawling estate home

The home, which lies on the border between Worcestershire and Shropshire, was put on the market with Knight Frank in May last year with the estate agency today confirming a sale.

While they would not reveal the final price, the estate is thought to have sold for around £16million - making it one of the most expensive sales outside of the M25. 

The hall is largely Georgian, having been rebuilt for a second time in the 1790s, and contains a library, drawing room, morning room, reception hall, dining room, kitchen and service passage boasting period features such as regency chimney pieces and moulded cornices and overdoors.

The gardens, described as 'a legacy of historic Elizabethan, Georgian and Victorian designs', include a walled kitchen garden and a sunken rose garden, whilst there is also a butler's pantry room, boot room, scullery, cloakrooms, offices and cellars.

It is only the second time in its history the house has been sold, with Knight Frank describing the property as 'a quintessential English sporting estate'.

Instead of being bought by a wealthy foreign family as so many expensive UK homes currently are, Shakenhurst's new owners are the Staddons, a farming family from Devon.

They said: 'Having to relocate, we knew the right place for us was somewhere which provided similar farming requirements within our scope.

'We were in search of a large number of acres of fertile arable land, the ability to rear quality livestock and accommodate a dairy unit, with the opportunity to expand and take on new challenges.

Magnificent: The mansion boasts 12-bedrooms itself, while the estate comes with 15 farmhouses and cottages, almost three miles of trout fishing and a high-quality shoot

'Our list of objectives was hard to fulfil but the Shakenhurst Estate offered us what was needed.

'Having been a farming family for many generations, we hope that our new purchase will be the excellent foundations for many years to come.'

The Staddons now own a Grade II listed 18th century home boasting a staggering 17,000 square feet of internal space.

It has 12 bedrooms, eight reception rooms and nine bathrooms - with the large rooms having high ceilings and plenty of Georgian period features.

Outside are formal gardens, parkland, a lake, stabling, traditional farm buildings and it comes with planning permission for a tennis court and swimming pool.

They also have more than 1,300 acres of land, a pheasant shoot and wild brown trout fishing on the River Rea.

In total, all the properties which are included in the estate boast 58 bedrooms.

Shakenhurst Estate can be traced back to the Domesday Book when the is belonged to Ralph de Toeni.

Historic: Shakenhurst Estate can be traced back to the Domesday Book, when the stately home was owned by Ralph de Toeni 

Family home: In 1349, Edward III granted Shakenhurst to his vassal, John de Meysey for services rendered overseas. It stayed with the same family until 2010 when it was sold for the first time in its history

The entire estate at Cleobury Mortimer, near Kidderminster, was later passed to one his descendents - John de Meysey - as a gift by King Edward III in 1349. It was to reward 'services rendered overseas' - probably in battle against the French.

Incredibly, it stayed with the same family until 2010 when it was sold for the first time in its history.

The owners then carried out an extensive restoration of the house and estate before selling it to The Staddon Family.

Knight Frank today said the sale demonstrates a degree of confidence returning to the prime country market.

Data from the agency shows prices in this area of the market increased by 5.5 per cent in 2013 while the number of potential buyers registering interest is up 16.1 per cent in 2013.

Clive Hopkins, Head of Knight Frank's Farms and Estates team, said: 'Shakenhurst is a wonderful residential, agricultural and sporting estate in the true sense of the word.

'There is tremendous potential to continue the amazing improvements the vendors have embarked on.

'Opportunities such as this are rare as demonstrated by the fact this is only the 2nd time it has sold in 665 years.'

It is thought Shakenhurst Estate was gifted to Ralph de Toeni by William the Conqueror

According to the Domesday Book, in 1086 the manor of Shakenhurst was in the ownership of Ralph de Toeni, the son of a Norman baron who fought in the Battle of Hastings in 1066, and died aged 74 in 1102.

It is thought he was gifted Shakenhurst by William the Conqueror, but it is unclear whether he lived there as a tenant of the Crown or as the landowner.

His father, Roger, who was born in Tosni, France, earned a fearsome reputation fighting the Saracens around Barcelona after he was sent into exile.

He became known as 'The Spaniard', and spread terror after butchering captives and then boiling and feeding their bodies to the other prisoners.

Roger later returned to Normandy but died in 1040, with his two eldest sons, from injuries sustained in a battle with a neighbouring land owner.

It is unclear what happened to Shakenhurst until 1280, when records show the de Stuttenhursts, who later changed their name to de Shakenhurst, were living there, probably as Crown tenants.

By 1339,  Walter de Shakenhurst, the Sheriff of Worcestershire and John de Meysey's uncle, was in situ. Walter died without having any children but passed the right to live at Shakenhurst on to Meysey.

Edward III then handed over the entire estate to Meysey, whose family are thought to have come to England from Meysey in Brittany with William the Conqueror.

William Lorimere, a trustee of the estate and a relative of Mr Severne, said: 'What we do not know is what those services rendered overseas were which prompted the King to gift Shakenhurst to Meysey.

'Shakenhurst was a royal estate, with inhabitants living on it like modern-day tenants.

'One can only speculate but 1349 was right in the thick of the Hundred Years' War - perhaps Meysey took part and was rewarded with ownership of the estate for fighting against the French.'

Shakenhurst remained with the Meyseys until 1906, when the widow of Charles Wigley Wicksted, a Meysey descendent, left it to her godson, Hugh Gurney and his wife Sybil, satisfied that a handful of other Meysey descendents would be well provided for by three further country properties the family owned.

Shakenhurst was used as a school for girls during the Second World War, by which time the widowed Mrs Gurney were struggling under a £20,000 gambling debt run up by their son, Peter, during his first year at Oxford University.

She was forced to sell off substantial parts of the estate to settle the debt, and the house fell into disrepair with Mrs Gurney living in just two upstairs rooms.

The property fell back into the hands of a Meysey descendent when Mrs Gurney left it to Michael Severne upon her death in 1961. It followed an impromptu visit he made to Shakenhurst 11 years earlier, where he told Mrs Gurney how the property was his ancestral home.

Mr Severne and wife Rachel set about reviving the estate and launched a business manufacturing Perspex from a stable block in the grounds, which provided Shakenhurst with a much needed income. The firm moved to a new site in the Midlands following his death in 2007.

In May 2008, his daughter Amanda died of cancer at the age of just 54, leaving a husband, a son and a daughter.
