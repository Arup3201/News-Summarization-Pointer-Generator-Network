An international drug trafficking ring forced dogs to swallow bags of cocaine and then brutally sliced the animals open to retrieve them.

Police said they arrested 75 people 
across northern Italy and Rome for using the dogs in a drug scam - at least 50 were died after being cut open.

Large breeds such as Great Danes, Labradors and Mastiffs were used by the gang to maximise their trafficking.

The dogs were forced to swallow the bags containing 2.8 pounds of cocaine,  the Italian news agency ANSA reported,

When the gang wanted to retrieve the drugs they sliced open the dogs and pulled out the bags. It is unclear how the animals were made to swallow such big bundles of cocaine.

The suspects are part of a gang with links to South American drug cartels.

The suspects could face charges of criminal association, drug trafficking and illegal weapon possession, ANSA said.

Human mules often swallow carefully 
wrapped packages of drugs or stuff them in to body cavities to keep them
 hidden as they smuggle them through airport security and across 
borders.

But if plastic
 pellets or condoms housing valuable consignments of Class A drugs burst
 in transit, the mules face an agonising death.

This is not the first case of dogs 
being used as drugs mules - a few years ago a four-year-old sheepdog 
was flown from Colombia to New York City with cocaine sewn into its 
belly.

Customs agents said the sheepdog had 10 cocaine-filled
 condoms sewn into its stomach as a way of smuggling the drug into the 
U.S.

Suspicious agents ordered X-rays afrer notcing the sickly condition of the dog.

They then spotted the condoms, which apparently had caused an infection that kept the dog from eating.

In
 2008 a graphic TV advert showing a fictional dog being used as a drugs 
mule forms part of a £1million government campaign against cocaine use.

Weapons: Other items recovered by police include a knife and a handgun

Charges: The suspects could face charges of criminal association, drug trafficking and illegal weapon possession, ANSA said

Claims: The gang is suspected of killing about 50 dogs to smuggle drugs

Its aim was to warn teenagers about the dangers of using the drug.

In
 one advert a person can be seen placing his hands inside the ripped 
open stomach of fictional dog Pablo as he fishes around for drugs.

Various parts of the the dog's intestines appear to be pulled out before two packets of  cocaine are found.

In a shocking twist the ad finishes with the dog looking up at the camera.
