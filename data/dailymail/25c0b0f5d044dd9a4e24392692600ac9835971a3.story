Girls rock. And this season the only accessory you really need hanging off your arm is your best friend.

Model mates Poppy Delevingne and Alexa Chung set out on a seriously stylish girls-only roadtrip for online fashion magazine The Edit earlier this summer. As well as posing in their classic convertible the two beautiful BFFs opened up about their ten year friendship, their wildest nights out, and why they feel it's so important to support and encourage the women in their lives.

Poppy, 28, first met Alexa, 30, ten years ago at a casting call, and recalls that even then the brunette had stand out style. Poppy says: 'I remember thinking she was very beautiful, almost cat-like, but definitely a bit of a bloke. She was wearing skinny jeans that I wanted/needed in my life immediately – a feeling I had no idea would resonate every time I saw her.'

Aside from their mutual love of fashion, both women share a fondness for wild times. 'The real turning point was when we went moonlit skinny-dipping in the sea at Cannes. It was spectacular. At 4:00 a.m., rummaging through bushes for our stray couture, I realized it wasn’t just another friendship,' says Poppy.

The fashionista friends are lucky enough to have toured the world together, for work and fun, but of the two Poppy maintains that it is Alexa who has the most amazing stories: 'I love living vicariously through tales of her love life. That was one of the reasons for inviting her on this trip – we’re boy-crazy. James (Poppy's new husband) knows I’m boy-crazy and always will be, but Alexa is really boy-crazy.

'What else? (Alexa) scoffs pasta for breakfast, sunbathes topless and is brilliant with people – in short, the perfect vacation companion.'

Poppy, pictured in a selection of Americana-inspired designer denim and dresses, also delves into her relationship with sister and model-of-the-moment, Cara Delevingne: 'When it comes to work, I’m not competitive at all. Having Cara as my baby, I had to learn quite quickly that I couldn’t be competitive because I had a sister who meant more to me.

'And I knew she was going to be brilliant, so I had to become very aware of not comparing.

'I don’t understand women who don’t encourage each other. I think compliments and showing affection are really important, too. Women don’t do that enough and it’s so essential, because even if you’re shy about giving a compliment, it’s good energy, it’s uplifting.”
