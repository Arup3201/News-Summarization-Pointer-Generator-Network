American low-cost carrier, Spirit Airlines, has just acquired its 69th plane and has found an interesting way to celebrate.

Not only has the airline slashed roundtrip fairs to £69 in April and May - including taxes and fees - but they also announced such a drastic price drop with some rather cheeky copy.

The emails sent around announcing the sale reference a particular sexual act in very blatant terms, with some customers complaining that the new campaign is in poor taste.

American budget airline, Spirit Airlines, is celebrating it's 69th plane with low fares and cheeky ad campaign

'We've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years,' Spirit's website reads.

'It's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother's bed (the one with the fantastic articles). 

'#69 is perfect: just the right size, with a cockpit that's in your face (because it's bright yellow). 

'Use your mouth to spread the word: Spirit is in an even better position to get you where you're going.' 

Spirit has long taken a tongue-in-cheek approach to its promotions, calling itself the 'home of the bare fare' 

The company has already used the provocative slogan, 'Home of the Bare Fare,' when discussing their competitive pricing in the past.

In fact, the phrase is currently emblazoned on several of its aircraft.

In much the same vein, Spirit spokesman Paul Berry said, in a statement, that the latest campaign was simply a reflection of the airline's unconventional and quirky personality.

'Spirit isn't your typical airline and we don't want to be.

'We enjoy being different than other airlines.'

However, some customers have took to social media to question if the ad campaign has gone a bit too far

'When it comes to advertising, different means we don't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares.

'But we're also different because our ads are fun, provocative, sometimes silly and often irreverent.

'They get lots of attention.

'The vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are. We understand there is a small group of people who feel differently.'
