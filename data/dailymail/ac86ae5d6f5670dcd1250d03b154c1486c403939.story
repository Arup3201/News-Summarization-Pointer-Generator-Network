A prankster has registered a x-rated website domain in the name of a married Texas Republican congressman.

Father-of-two Blake Farenthold is supposedly  signed up for the address 'Blow-me.org', according to the internet database Whoisology.

The email address and telephone number on the listing links back to the Tea Party member's Elect Blake Farenthold Committee. 

Prank victim? Father-of-two Blake Farenthold is supposedly signed up for the address 'Blow-me.org', according to the internet database Whoisology

The contact details are also related to the congressman's computing business, Farenthold Consulting Group, that he set up in 1996. 

Farenthold, who has represented Texas's 27th congressional district since 2011, has yet to comment on the issue. 

During his campaign, a photo of him posing in his 'duckie' pyjamas next to a lingerie model at a fundraiser was released.

He had innocently attended the event at a local bar, but Democrat incumbent Solomon Ortiz wasted no time running an advert with the image, and others of Mr Farenthold drinking alcohol and attending other celebrations.

The opponent said that Mr Farenthold plans to give the rich bankers on Wall Street a 'trillion-dollar tax cut'.  

In April of this year, Farenthold told Attorney General Eric Holder that he should be in jail rather than answering questions during a Capitol Hill Hearing. 

I'm committed to maintaining the constitutional balance of power and the authority that this legislative branch has,' Farenthold said, 'and I just don’t think it’s appropriate that Mr. Holder be here.'

'If an American citizen had not complied with one of the Justice Department’s subpoenas, they would be in jail and not sitting here in front of me testifying.' 

Franenthold is yet to comment on the revelations. 

The website for his computing firm reads: 'Farenthold Consulting is a computer consulting firm specializing in helping professionals use technology to become more productive. We'll help you design, purchase, maintain, and use your computers. 

'We'll also help your business connect to and design a presence on the Internet. We don't sell anything but our professional service.'
