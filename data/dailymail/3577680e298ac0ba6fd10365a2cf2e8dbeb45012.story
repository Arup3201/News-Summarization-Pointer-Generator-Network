Prosecutors are considering further charges against disgraced television weatherman Fred Talbot, who last month was convicted of abusing schoolboys as young as 14.

The Crown Office in Scotland was handed a report from police investigating historical allegations of abuse that are said to have taken place over a 13-year period between 1968 and 1981.

Talbot, 65, will be sentenced in Manchester tomorrow after a jury found him guilty of indecently assaulting to pupils in the mid-1970s during his former career as a biology teacher. 

The former This Morning star attacked two teenagers on school trips on a canal boat while he was teaching in the 1970s and now faces jail.

However Talbot, who taught at Altrincham Grammar School near Manchester, was cleared of eight other indecent assaults on three other boys. 

Talbot was remanded in custody after the conviction on 13 February.

Both of the victims, said to be 14 or 15 at the time, were assaulted on school  trips in the Cheshire area.

Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard Talbot was 'obsessed' with teenage boys throughout his teaching career and 'could not help himself' around them when under the influence of drink. 

Talbot resigned in disgrace from the school in 1984 after making indecent comments to two 15-year-old pupils but hid the indiscretion when his big TV break came a year later.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s Talbot was a regular on ITV's This Morning, where he presented weather updates from a floating map in Liverpool's Albert Dock.

He continued to cover his tracks when police first investigated him in 1992 and lied again to detectives when they uncovered a host of diaries which were littered with references to sexual encounters.

After he was convicted at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court, it emerged he was also the subject of a historical abuse inquiry by police into complaints about offences said to have been committed in Scotland.

The report was received from Police Scotland today and is currently being considered by the procurator fiscal.

A statement from the Crown Office in Scotland, said: 'The procurator fiscal has received a report relating to incidents involving a 65-year-old man, said to have occurred between January 1968 and January 1981.

'The report is currently under consideration by the procurator fiscal.'
