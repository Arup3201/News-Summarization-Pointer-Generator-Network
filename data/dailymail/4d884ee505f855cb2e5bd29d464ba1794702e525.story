They were alleged to have called it quits when Nico Jackson wasn't invited to her mother Carole's recent birthday bash in the Caribbean.

But Pippa Middleton put rumours of a split with her handsome boyfriend to rest when the pair attended the British Heart Foundation's Roll Out The Red Ball fundraiser hand-in-hand on Tuesday evening.

Also in attendance was her brother James Middleton and his partner Donna Air, with whom Pippa seemed extremely close to at the event, held at The Park Lane Hotel in Piccadilly, London.

Wow, who’s this lady in red? It’s Pippa Middleton at the British Heart Foundation fundraiser, of course, and she’s got our pulses racing in this striking scarlet floral lace dress styled with matching suede stilettos.

The nearly-royal went all out to support the Roll Out Red Ball fundraiser in aid of the charity with her head-to-toe scarlet style hit, accessorising the elegant lace dress with a pair of suede stilettos from her and The Duchess of Cambridge’s go-to brand when it comes to footwear, L.K. Bennett.

The elegant shoe, cloaked in smooth scarlet suede for a luxe finish, oozes classic elegance with its pointed toe and vertiginous heel, set to lift any outfit from a dress such as this to a pair of skinny jeans. And the best part is that the patent leather version is on sale for $175 – but not for long since Pippa’s just worn them, so hurry up and nab your pair now!

If you're after a similar pair for less, then take a peek at the style edit below which crosses the whole spectrum in terms of price, starting from Jaclyn Smith's $14.99 pair to Gianvito Rossi skyscraper heels at $660.
