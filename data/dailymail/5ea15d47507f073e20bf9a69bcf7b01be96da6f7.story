A wealthy businessman who accidentally killed his four-year-old daughter when he lifted her into the rotor blades of his helicopter took his own life by gassing himself in his Mayfair office, an inquest has heard.

Managing director of MFH Helicopters Nicholas Hawkings-Byass, 59, was found dead at his office on March 7 this year, the hearing was told.

Westminster Coroner's Court was told that 18 years ago that helicopter enthusiast Mr Hawkings-Byass had taken his son Alexander, and four-year-old daughter Lydia for a flight near to the family’s country home in Gloucestershire.

After the flight had landed he was just about to set off again, when his young daughter ran to him and asked to be picked up. 

She was struck by the rotor blades as he lifted her onto his shoulders.

The coroner at the time recorded a verdict of accidental death.

But the court heard that Oxford University graduate Mr Hawkings-Byass had to live with the tragedy for the rest of his life.

Son Alexander, who saw his sister killed in 1996, was at Westminster Coroner’s Court to hear that his father’s company was not 'making any profit', according to the company secretary of 25 years Sara Macdonald.

Coroner Shirley Radcliffe told the inquest: 'The company secretary has said in her statement that there were some financial problems but nothing particularly serious, but personally, the tragic incident with his daughter may have been playing on his mind.'

Sara Macdonald described how she found Mr Hawkings-Byass in a statement read to the court. 

She said: 'I last saw him on March 5th at around 4.30pm and he was alive and well in the office.

'He said he had a cold and was feeling ghastly. I left the office and I thought he would do the same.'

The inquest heard how the next day the office door was locked, and his secretary assumed he was at home, but when she received a call from his wife, she became concerned.

She continued: 'His wife called and asked where he was.

'His office door was still locked so I called the locksmith out. When he opened the door, I pushed it open and I saw him.'

Coroner Radcliffe told the inquest that when paramedics arrived, they did not attempt to resuscitate Mr Hawkings-Byass as they 'recognised he had been dead for some time.'

The court heard that Mr Hawkings-Byass, who was a keen sportsman and enjoyed hunting and skiing, had suffered from hepatitis at the time of his death, and was one-and-a-half times over the legal drink-drive limit.

She said the amount he had drunk would not 'make him intoxicated enough to not have a clear thought.'

The Coroner recorded a verdict of suicide, as Mr Hawkings Byass, of Marlborough, Wiltshire, had left a note addressed to his wife Clare.

She told the inquest that there had been a 'hint of depression' and said that due to the note, she was satisfied that Mr Hawkings- Byass intended to kill himself.

She said: 'The letter suggest that he had given premeditated thought to his act. There is significant evidence to suggest that he intended to kill himself.'

She gave the cause of death as mechanical obstruction of the upper airways.

She told his son Alex: 'Please send my condolences to your family and in particular to your mother in such tragic circumstances.'
