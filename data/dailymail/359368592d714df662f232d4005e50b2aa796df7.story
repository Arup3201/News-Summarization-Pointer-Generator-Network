Two women were today jailed for carrying out a vicious assault that left a stiletto shoe lodged in another woman's cheek.

Janet Atherton, 50, and Jacqueline Philips, 52, attacked their 59-year-old victim after she complained about the toilet being blocked at Philips's home in Wigan, Lancashire.

They pulled her hair and scratched her face, before kicking her - causing one of Atherton's shoes to fly into her face so hard that the heel became stuck in her cheek.

The unnamed woman was left with blood pouring down her face, and was later taken to hospital with a puncture wound and severe bruising to her face and arms.

Today, Detective Constable Claire Hughes, of Greater Manchester Police, branded the attackers 'vultures'.

'These two women acted like vultures, and viciously attacked an innocent women who theyhad invited back to Philipsâ€™s house,' she said. 

Horrific: They pulled her hair and scratched her face, before kicking her - causing one of Atherton's shoes to became stuck in the woman's cheek

'They set upon her because she dared to criticise the cleanliness of the bathroom. 

'The victim was so scared she feared for her own life and thought they were going to kill her - she had blood dripping down her face.'

Atherton and Philips, both from Wigan, have now been jailed after being found guilty of varying assault charges at Liverpool Crown Court.

Atherton was sentenced to seven years in prison for causing grievous bodily harm with intent, while Philips will serve a two-year prison sentence for the lesser offence of wounding.

The victim had bumped into the pair, who were socialising with her friend at The Milstone Pub in Wigan, on the evening of December 31 last year, the court heard.

They all left the pub at around 11.30pm and moved to another venue to see in the New Year, before Philips invited them back to her home.

While at the house, the victim went to the bathroom, before returning to tell Philips that the toilet was messy and unblocked.

Her comments caused Philips to point and exclaim: 'Who do you think you are?'

Atherton was then said to have 'totally flown off the handle', before she and Philips started to pull the victim's hair and scratch her face.

Atherton then repeatedly kicked her - causing one of her stiletto shoes to slam so hard into the side of the woman's face that the heel became lodged in her cheek.

During the attack, the victim had blood pouring down her face and was screaming at the pair to stop, the court heard. 

When Philips and Atherton eventually stopped, they told their victim that she deserved it - to which she pleaded her case and said she had only said that the toilet was dirty.

Det Con Hughes said: 'These two women are now where they belong, behind bars and I hope todayâ€™s sentence means their victim can move on with her life knowing justice has been done.'
