Owen Fazenbaker III, 32, was arrested for skipping jury duty 11 times while visiting a courthouse 

A Pennsylvania man who skipped out on jury duty 11 times in the last year was arrested in the place he'd been trying to avoid - the courthouse. 

Owen Fazenbaker III, 32, was at the Somerset County Courthouse seeking relief from a child support ruling when he got nabbed for his many absences. 

Somerset County Judge D. Gregory Geary said he found it 'ironic' that Fazenbaker could find his way to court for that but couldn't show up when called for jury duty. 

On Monday Fazenbaker promised he would serve on future juries if he was not handed down a $500 fine and 10 days in jail for each time he had missed jury duty.

Judge Geary told Fazenbaker he could avoid a seven-day jail sentence if he paid the $500 fine, according to the Daily American.
