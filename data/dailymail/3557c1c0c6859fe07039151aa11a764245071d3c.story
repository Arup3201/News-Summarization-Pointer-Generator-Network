With little sleep, sore nipples and serious lifestyle adjustments to make, being a new mother is tough, no matter who you are.

So spare a thought for Trish, 25, who has had to cope with the upheaval all without being able to use her arms or legs.

Despite the challenges she faces, Trish, who suffers from a rare condition called arthrogryposis, is determined to prove the critics who thought she wouldn't be able to cope wrong.

I'm a disabled mum whose arms don't work, whose legs don't work. Everybody assumed I wouldn't be able to manage,' reveals Trish. 'You learn to cope in different ways.'

'From being a baby, everything went in 
my mouth,' she adds. 'It might be hard, you might have to try loads of different 
ways round it but there is a way of doing absolutely everything.'

For Trish, who lives in South Shields with husband Pete, 33 and children Jessica, four, and PJ, two, this means doing everything from preparing breakfast to changing a nappy using her teeth.

The amount of times I've tasted 
poo,' she grimaces. It's so much easier to do a newborn's nappy because they can't 
move - they can't run off from you!'

Also defying the doubters is 26-year-old single mum, Michelle, who has pseudoachondroplasia - the rarest form of dwarfism.

Just 3ft 6in tall, Michelle's two-year-old son Treziah is almost as big and strong as she is, which means she's forced to hold on to him using reins when they go out.

Despite the difficulties, Michelle is just as determined as Trish to make motherhood work in spite of her disabilities.

'You find ways round everything,' adds Trish, who has just had a third child. 'It's problem solving. I find it [motherhood] harder but it's rewarding. It's more rewarding than it is challenging.

'I can do more for the children than I can do for myself.'
