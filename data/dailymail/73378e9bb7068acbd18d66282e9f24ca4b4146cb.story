Tougher laws: Patrick Mercer is Tory MP for Newark and an ex Army colonel

In 1999, the Norfolk farmer Tony 
Martin killed one of my constituents and injured another when they went 
to burgle his farm. Quite rightly, Mr Martin was prosecuted and served 
time in prison but the case became a cause celebrate.

Last
Sunday, Andy Ferrie and his wife Tracey from Leicestershire used a 
legally-held shotgun to defend themselves against a number of men who 
are alleged to have broken into their property.

Two
of them were wounded and the Ferries were held and questioned by police
for more than two days before being released at the behest of the Crown
Prosecution Service.

Now,
the two cases are very different, but there is one important similarity
– the law does not protect householders from intrusion in the way I 
believe that it should.

In 2004, I initiated a Private Members' Bill that would have solved the problem.

After the Martin case, there had been a very important change in civil law.

Brendan Fearon, my constituent who had been wounded in the burglary, attempted to sue Mr Martin for the injuries that he caused.

As
civil law then stood, he would have to prove that Mr Martin had used 
'unreasonable force'. Very quickly, though, the government of the day 
amended civil law and raised the threshold using the phrase 'grossly 
disproportionate' force.

My
Bill was designed to bring criminal law into step with civil law. 
Dominic Grieve, the then Shadow Attorney General, drafted a simple 
amendment which would have  the effect of giving ordinary householders 
the protection of the 'grossly disproportionate' proviso.

It seemed at one stage that the Bill 
had the support of Tony Blair and the then Met Police Commissioner. 
Brendan Fearon even told my local newspaper that such a change in the 
law would deter him from breaking and entering in future. The whole 
issue was immensely popular.

My Bill was scuppered by a disgraceful piece of chicanery  from the Labour Party.

I
was delighted, then, when the Conservative manifesto in 2010 said: 'We 
will give householders greater legal protection if they have to defend 
themselves against intruders in their own homes.'

Such
promises were not contained in the Coalition Agreement although the 
Coalition has tweaked the law a little further. But it's cases such as 
that of the Ferries that must cause decisive action to be taken now.

This need can only be underlined by 
the extraordinary statement from Judge Peter Bowers last week who 
apparently told an offender that 'it takes a huge amount of courage ... 
for somebody to burgle somebody's house'.

It is an astounding statement and the Prime Minister, absolutely properly, condemned it completely.

But
he also went on to say 'that's why this Government is changing the law 
to toughen the rules on self defence towards burglars'.

Really? It's two years later and yet we still do not have the 'grossly disproportionate' phrase enshrined in criminal law.

Released: Andy and Tracey Ferrie were held for more than two days by police

I don't want householders to be given
a licence to butcher intruders in their homes, but I do want normal 
people to feel that the law is unquestionably on their side and  not on 
that of the criminals.

I
also want the police and the CPS to be confident about not putting 
people like the Ferries through days of anguish when such anguish should
be reserved for offenders.

When
they were in Opposition, the Tories seemed very clear about what needed
to be done. Indeed, many of my Bill's greatest supporters are now in 
power. Yet, something is stopping them from putting their earlier words 
into action.

Dithering
doesn't deter. The Government needs to listen, not just to decent 
people, but to burglars like Brendan Fearon and change the law now.
