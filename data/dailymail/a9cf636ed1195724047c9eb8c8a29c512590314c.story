National Lottery managers have come under fire for earmarking £5m for executives' bonuses - as it prepares to double the price of the tickets.

Bosses at Camelot's parent company Premier Lotteries Investments UK have set aside a total £11.3m of pay for 'key management' over eight years, including £5m for bonuses, as long as they reach 'challenging targets'.

Details of the company's accounts caused new controversy for the firm already under fire for announcing plans to raise the ticket price this autumn.

Fingers crossed: Bonuses for top staff including chief executive DianneThompson are dependent upon 'challenging targets'

Many threatened to boycott the National Lottery when the price rises from £1 to £2 this September, saying it was a 'tax on the poor'.

Today, critics expressed anger at the plan to boost the top management's pay after hiking the price of lottery tickets.

Marc Gander, of the Consumer Action Group, told the Daily Express: 'If you were wondering where your money is going, now you know.

'I suppose one of the benefits of being a Lottery boss is you can look forward to a huge win without even having to buy a ticket.'

And Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: 'Lottery players are being fleeced...with these bonus increases we can see why.'

A Camelot spokesman said the money was for 25 'key managers' and was 'not a payment but a provision' that would only be paid if challenging targets were met.

She added: 'There is a bonus scheme available to all staff in companies across the Group.

'Attracting and retaining the highest
 calibre of staff at all levels has been a key factor in Camelot's 
continuing success as one of the world’s leading lottery groups.'

Last year the company paid out £6.5m to bosses, including bonuses of £900,000.  Camelot chief executive Dianne Thompson earns around £1million a year, not including her bonus.

When they announced plans to double the price of a ticket, Camelot said it would mean bigger prizes for winners.

But there was widespread anger at the news, and one snap poll found that as many as eight out of ten could give up buying Lottery tickets.

MPs and campaigners said the increase was a ‘tax on the poor’ and ‘sheer greed’ and research revealed pensioners and those on low incomes would be hit hardest.

Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton in Essex, said: ‘With the price of everything going up, and given the profits they make, it would be nice if the people who run the National Lottery didn’t put up the price of a ticket.

'It’s not as if they are short of a few bob.’

The Lottery's official Twitter account  @TNLUK was bombarded with complaints as customers said the new ticket price was a 'rip-off' designed to 'fund the company directors' lavish lifestyles'.

Lottery backlash: People vented their outrage on Twitter after Camelot said the ticket price was to double

Customers called the increase a ‘rip-off’ and complained that organiser Camelot was forcing customers to ‘fund the company directors’ lavish lifestyles’ by doubling prices.

But it emerged yesterday that the lottery operator planned to cut the amount from each ticket sold that it gives to good causes, to fund the bigger prizes.

The company, which has run the National Lottery since it began in 1994, raised £6.5 billion in ticket sales last year.

Lotto is the main game in the National Lottery but its sales have been falling for a number of years. Camelot believes that without its proposed changes, which have been cleared by the regulator, the National Lottery Commission, that decline will continue.
