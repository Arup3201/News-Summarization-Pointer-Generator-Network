A young woman gives her dashing white steed a hug as she rides through woodland; another horse owner smiles to the camera as she poses with her chestnut brown companion.

Dedicated Emily Hancock spends hours wandering through forests snapping pictures of ponies enjoying a trek with their owners or roaming free.

The 29-year-old, from Burley in Hampshire’s New Forest, has taken hundreds of images of horses galloping through fields, trees, huge puddles and rivers.
