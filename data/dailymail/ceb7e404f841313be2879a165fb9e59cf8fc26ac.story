Police are routinely telling victims of crime to become ‘DIY detectives’ and investigate offences themselves.

Officers are washing their hands of thousands of crimes unless the public can provide them with clues.

Victims are asked to interview neighbours, look for fingerprints, find CCTV footage and even check eBay for their stolen property.

On the beat: A report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary has said police are increasingly staying at their desks and asking victims of crime to investigate offences themselves - even by looking for fingerprints or CCTV

If no leads are found police will not even leave their desks to investigate, and cases are closed within hours.

The approach to crimes such as car thefts, vandalism and shed burglaries was revealed in a damning report by the police performance watchdog.

Roger Baker, of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, said officers had ‘nearly decriminalised’ many low-level offences.

‘Unless you’ve got the powers of Mystic Meg, or something like that, [without] turning up and using your skills it’s going to be mightily difficult to bring people to justice,’ he said.

‘Effectively what’s happened is a number of crimes are on the verge of being decriminalised. It’s not the fault of the individual staff, it’s a mindset thing that’s crept in to policing to say “we’ve almost given up”.’

His report also found that forces are losing track of thousands of suspects, and often do not know who has failed to answer bail.

Worrying: Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, said lives are being put at risk

Some 17 forces were caught deploying community support officers (PCSOs) to investigate serious offences, including assaults, even though they have little training and no powers of arrest.

Officers were also accused of inappropriately arranging interviews at their convenience, instead of seeing crime victims immediately.

Senior staff were criticised for having little idea of what their employees actually do all day. But officials saved their most scathing comments for the ‘emerging trend’ of asking victims to solve their own crimes, and so-called ‘desk-based investigations’.

They highlighted how victims are being told to make their own enquiries, from hunting for fingerprints to checking second-hand sales websites. Mr Baker said: ‘HMIC finds this expectation that the victim should investigate his own crime both surprising and a matter of material concern.

'The police have been given powers and resources to investigate crime by the public, and there should be no expectation on the part of the police that an inversion of that responsibility is acceptable.’

Officials said that if ‘properly carried out’, investigations by an officer at his or her desk can be a ‘cost-effective’ way of dealing with a report of a crime.

However, in the vast majority of cases the practice is merely an administrative procedure that sees a crime recorded, then filed away and forgotten.

‘All too often, “desk-based investigation” appears to mean little or nothing more than recording a crime without taking further action,’ Mr Baker warned.

His report found attendance rates at crime scenes varied widely between forces, from 39 per cent in Warwickshire to 100 per cent in Cleveland.

Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, said many senior officers lack the basic information they need to direct their staff effectively.

He said lives are being put at risk because forces are not deploying their assets to the ‘highest level of efficiency and effectiveness’.

Last week it emerged that millions of card fraud cases were left out of figures used by the Government when claiming crime has fallen.

Researchers found nearly 4million offences were ignored in the Crime Survey for England and Wales. When added to that data, they show crime has risen by 50 per cent, from a record low of 7.3million offences a year to 11million – with seven people defrauded every minute.
