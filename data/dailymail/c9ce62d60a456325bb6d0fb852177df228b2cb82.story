The Beatles famously sung about a psychedelic fantasy Yellow Submarine in the 1960s.

With the potential to be slightly more dangerous, but just as colourful, the Iranian Navy has been showcasing the latest addition to its fleet - a brilliant bright turquoise blue submarine.

Designers of the domestically-produced warship must have thought that the bizarre shade would make the craft blend in with the deep waters of the high seas.

But it's hard to believe that the enemy won't see this one coming with the colour making it stand out like a sore thumb against the water's surface.

The Navy was showing off the eye-catching creation, which is around the size of a frigate, on Iran state television yesterday.

Navy officials, rather conservatively dressed in plain dark uniforms compared to their dazzling ship, watched as the Sina-7, equipped with anti-ship missiles, was launched at Bandar Abbas, near the strategic Strait of Hormuz.

Two new Iranian-built Ghadir subs and two repaired hovercraft were also delivered to the Navy.

Navy chief Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari was quoted on Iranian television as saying that the nation must possess the 'newest technology and top-grade facilities to protect its borders.'

Ghadir class submarines can fire missiles and torpedoes at the same time, and can operate in the Persian Gulf's shallow waters.

Iran has sought to upgrade its air defense and naval capabilities, saying any possible future attacks on it would come from the air and sea.

The country now claims to be 'self sufficient' in terms of supplying equipment to meet its military needs.
