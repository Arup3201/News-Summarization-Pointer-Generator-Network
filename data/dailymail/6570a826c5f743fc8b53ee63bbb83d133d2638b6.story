Ukraine has put its military on high alert and appealed for international help to avoid what it fears is a possible wider invasion by Russia. 

Meanwhile, outrage over Russia's military moves mounted in world capitals, with US secretary of state John Kerry calling on President Vladimir Putin to pull back from 'an incredible act of aggression'.

A day after Russia captured the Crimean Peninsula without firing a shot, fears grew in the Ukrainian capital and beyond that Russia might seek to expand its control by seizing other eastern parts of the country. 

The U.S. now believes that Russia has complete operational control of Crimea, a pro-Russian area of the country, and has more than 6,000 troops in the region.

Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said there was no reason for Russia to invade and warned that 'we are on the brink of disaster'.

World leaders rushed to try to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis.

Nato held an emergency meeting in Brussels, Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague flew to Kiev to support its new government and Mr Kerry prepared to to travel to Ukraine tomorrow.

'It is very important that we all do everything we can to calm tensions,' Mr Hague said, adding he had urged Russian officials to 'speak directly to the Ukrainians'.

The White House issued a joint statement on behalf of the Group of Seven today, saying the nations were suspending participation in the planning for the upcoming June summit to be held in Sochi, which hosted Russia's Winter Olympics, because Russia's advances in the Ukraine violated the 'principles and values' on which the G7 and G8 operate.

Mr Kerry, who previously talked about boycotting the G8 summit, as well as possible visa bans, asset freezes and trade and investment penalties against Russia. 

All the foreign ministers he spoke to were prepared 'to go to the hilt' to isolate Russia, he said.

Nato issued a statement saying it 'condemns Russia's military escalation in Crimea' and demanding that Russia respect its obligations under the United Nations charter.

Ukraine is not a Nato member, meaning the US and Europe are not obligated to come to its defence, but the country has taken part in some alliance exercises.

In Kiev, Moscow and other cities, thousands of protesters took to the streets to either condemn the Russian occupation or celebrate Crimea's return to its former ruler.

'Support us, America!' a group of protesters chanted outside the U.S. embassy in Kiev. One young girl held up a placard reading: 'No Russian aggression!'

'Russia! Russia!' the crowd chanted in Moscow.

Faced with the Russian threat, Ukraine's new government moved to consolidate its authority, naming new regional governors in the pro-Russia east, enlisting the support of the country's wealthy business leaders and sacking the head of the country's navy after he declared allegiance to the pro-Russian government in Crimea.

But Ukraine's new government and the West have so far been powerless to counter Russia's tactics. Armed men in uniforms without insignia have moved freely about Crimea for days, occupying airports, smashing equipment at an air base and besieging a Ukrainian infantry base.

Mr Putin has defied calls from the West to pull back his troops, insisting that Russia has a right to protect its interests and those of Russian-speakers in Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine.

His confidence is matched by the knowledge that Ukraine's 46 million people have divided loyalties. While much of western Ukraine wants closer ties with the 28-nation European Union, its eastern and southern regions like Crimea look to Russia for support.

Russia has long wanted to reclaim the lush Crimean Peninsula, part of its territory until 1954. Russia's Black Sea Fleet pays Ukraine millions every year to be stationed at the Crimean port of Sevastopol and nearly 60 per cent of Crimea's residents identify themselves as Russian.

During a phone conversation with Ms Merkel yesterday, Mr Putin 'directed her attention to the unrelenting threat of violence from ultra-nationalist forces (in Ukraine) that endangered the life and legal interests of Russian citizens', the Kremlin said.

'The measures taken by Russia are fully adequate with regard to the current extraordinary situation,' it said.

Ukraine's new government came to power last week following months of pro-democracy protests against the country's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych and his decision to turn Ukraine towards Russia instead of the EU. 

Mr Yanukovych fled to Russia after more than 80 people were killed in the protests, but insists he is still president.

Ukraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, put Ukraine's armed forces on alert yesterday, calling up reserves for training and stepping up security at nuclear power plants, airports and other strategic locations.

Mr Turchynov also moved to consolidate authority in eastern Ukraine, appointing 18 new regional governors, including two of the countries wealthiest businessmen, in the cities of Dneprotrovsk and Donetsk, as big business and the Ukrainian government united against Russia.

Ukraine's richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, whose SCM Group has 300,000 employees and interests in steel, coal and mining, urged businesses, ordinary people and the government to join together, saying the use of force and 'illegal action from outside' were 'impermissible'.

Russian troops, meanwhile, pulled up to the Ukrainian military base at Perevalne on the Crimean Peninsula in a convoy that included at least 13 trucks and four armoured vehicles with mounted machine guns.

In response, a dozen Ukrainian soldiers, some with clips in their rifles, placed a tank at the base's gate, leaving the two sides in a tense stand-off. It appeared to be the first known case of outmatched Ukrainians standing up to Russian military might.

Unidentified soldiers were also seen cutting power to the headquarters of the Ukrainian naval forces in Crimea - whose commander later defected and pledged his allegiance to 'the people of Crimea'.

In Kiev, a Ukrainian security official said the head of the Ukrainian navy - Admiral Denis Berezovsky - had been dismissed and faced a treason investigation after declaring his allegiance to the pro-Russian government in Crimea and offering no resistance to the Russian troops.

The speaker of Crimea's legislature, Vladimir Konstantinov, was quoted as saying local authorities did not recognise the new government in Kiev. He said a planned referendum on March 30 would ask voters about the region's future status.
