Madagascar's unique wildlife is under threat from an invasion of toxic toads, scientists have warned.

Researchers say the island's native species face an 'ecological disaster' caused by the arrival of Asian common toads.

Snakes feeding on the toads are especially at risk of poisoning, as are iconic Madagascan species such as lemurs and endemic birds.

Threat: Asian common toads, which are believed to have arrived in Madagascar on shipping containers, are poisonous to reptiles and animals if eaten

It is thought the amphibians were transported to the African island in shipping containers from south-east Asia.

Scientists say Madagascar could suffer a repeat of what happened in Australia when a relative of the poisonous amphibian, the cane toad, was introduced to control pests in 1935.

They proceeded to devastate native animal populations and have spread across much of the country, defying attempts to eradicate them.

The toads now number in their millions there.

The World Wildlife Fund says around 95 per cent of Madagascar's reptiles and 92 per cent of its mammals exist nowhere else on Earth.

In a letter to Nature magazine, 11 researchers warned that Asian common toads, or Duttaphrynus melanostictus, were spotted near Toamasina, Madagascar's largest seaport.

The females can lay 40,000 eggs a month and it is feared they will take advantage of the 'ideal resources and climate' to establish themselves.

Jonathan Kolby, a wildlife health researcher at James Cook University in Australia, and his colleagues wrote: 'Time is short, so we are issuing an urgent call to the conservation community and governments to prevent an ecological disaster.'

He told Nature that iconic Madagascan species such as the cat-like fossa, lemurs and endemic birds could be threatened, because they are likely to eat the venomous toads.

More than 50 species of endemic snake - including the ground boa - are also in jeopardy. The toads could also contaminate drinking water and transmit parasites to humans.

The potential catastrophe is not just restricted to Madagascar, said Mr Kolby.

'There is now a high dispersal risk of these toads spreading from Madagascar to other Indian Ocean islands such as the Mascarene Islands, Comoros and Seychelles,' he said.

The 11 co-signatories of the letter are calling for an urgent hunting programme to wipe out the toads before they take hold - including draining ponds to stop their breeding.
