Former parish clerk Lynne Turner, 50, is accused of taking £28,200 from the local authority

A parish council clerk helped herself to £28,000 of taxpayers money when she plunged into debt and took out a number of pay-day loans, a jury heard today.

Lynne Turner, 50, is accused of regularly transferring money from the parish council’s bank account into her own after she amassed £90,000 of debt and then took out loans from Wonga.com.  

She was arrested after her successor at the council noticed £28,200 was unaccounted for.

Turner, of High Wycombe, worked at Hughenden Parish Council in Buckinghamshire for 17 years before quitting in September 2011.

She told police when she was arrested two months later she had taken a series of high-interest pay-day loans after spiralling into debt.

She said in interview: ‘We didn’t have enough money saved. We got several loans to pay off each other. It was robbing Peter to pay Paul.’

But she said she did not know how the parish council money got into her account and said it was not done on purpose. 

Gavin Holme, prosecuting, told Oxford Crown Court, that Turner took the first sum of £300 from the council’s current account on August 28, 2010.

He said £21,900 was taken in 2009-10 and six separate sums of £1,000 the following year.

Mr Holme said: ‘During the period August 2010 to May 2011 Mrs Turner dishonestly, without any honest reason at all, transferred sums from Hughenden Parish Council’s account into her own account for her own use.’

He said as parish clerk, Turner had access to all the authority’s accounts and was able to transfer funds.

When her successor Charlotte Watts took over the role she noticed the missing money, which had been labelled ‘correction and ‘cash in transit’ in the council books.

But when she questioned Turner about what this meant she was not given an answer.

It was only when Mrs Watts spoke to the council’s bank staff that she discovered it had been paid into Turner’s own account.

Mrs Watts told the court: ‘Mrs Turner suggested there had been some sort of bank error, or a mistake and the figure should no longer be on the account and I should clear it from the account.

‘I didn’t feel at the end of our phone call that I understood it any better.

‘Once I established, to my great amazement, where the £6,000 pounds had gone I started thinking about whether that was the same case with the £21,900 pounds from the previous year.’

The court was told Turner had amassed about £90,000 in debt, on top of a £380,000 mortgage, and started to struggle financially when she and her husband Paul moved in 2004 and built an extension on their home.

Her husband had left his job as an accountant to work as a gardener and she was also supporting her unemployed son.

Mr Holme said: ‘She was also helping her son who was causing considerable cost to her.

‘In January 2010 she got herself into a bit of trouble. She said she did not tell her husband about the trouble they were in and he did not know details of the financial position.’

Bank statements from the time show a number of loans of Wonga.com and Pounds to Payday before the first transfer from the parish council.

When questioned by police Turner said she did not know how the transfers took place.

Mr Holme said: ‘Clearly she was struggling financially at the time.

‘She, for whatever reason, thought this was the appropriate way to deal with it.

‘There is no indication she offered to pay back the money before she left Hughenden Parish Council in 2011.’

Turner denies ten counts of fraud by abuse of position.

She told officers during a police interview in March last year that she had called the bank about the missing cash and was told that it may have been in another council account, but said she never chased that up.

She said that she had not noticed the money had in fact gone into her own account.

‘Looking at things on paper it sounds like a load of codswallop, I wouldn’t believe me if I heard all this.

‘I didn’t do it on purpose, people who know me wouldn’t think I did.’

The trial continues.
