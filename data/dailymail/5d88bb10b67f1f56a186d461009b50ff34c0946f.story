Tornadoes could rip through the Plains states today as a powerful spring storm dropped more 
than a foot of sloppy, wet snow in parts of Colorado and Wyoming.

Forecasters warned that three million people, from 
the Plains to the Mississippi Valley, were in the path of possible 'long-track' tornadoes, with Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa facing the 
greatest threat.

Multiple possible tornadoes were reported in Nebraska, warnings popped 
up across Iowa, and the governor of Missouri declared a state of 
emergency.

It came as a line of storms rolled through and threatened to 
spawn twisters and produce large hail.

The 
National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for most of 
northern Colorado and parts of southern Wyoming for Monday morning.

Strong 
thunderstorms and tornadoes developed in Nebraska and were threatening 
to push south. The storm also created high winds across the 
West.

Kyle Fredin, a 
meteorologist for the weather service in Boulder, said the weather 
pattern is typical for this time of year, and 'it's going to be kind of 
the same thing pretty much through the end of June.'

Several
 tornadoes were reported in southern Nebraska, blowing down 
outbuildings, damaging homes and knocking out power.

Large hail and 
strong winds seen in the state were expected to head south into Kansas, 
and a tornado watch was issued for parts of Oklahoma.

The
 storm was expected to weaken as it heads northeast from the Plains, 
possibly bringing rain as it moves into the Great Lakes, the weather 
service said.

In Colorado, 
Department of Transportation officials said plunging temperatures and 
heavy, wet snow created icy road conditions, and multiple accidents were
 reported on several highways.

Southwest
 of Denver, a seven-car pile-up on Sunday evening injured a sheriff's deputy
 on U.S. 285 near the community of Doubleheader, The Denver Post 
reported. Three others were hurt, but their 
injuries didn't appear to be life-threatening.

Weather
 was likely a factor in the crash, but its cause was still being 
investigated, sheriff's spokeswoman Jacki Kelley told the newspaper.

'The roads are just really bad out there,' she said.Â

In
 another Highway 285 crash, the State Patrol said a Jefferson County 
Sheriff's deputy who was helping a motorist that slid off the roadway 
was taken to a hospital with undetermined injuries after the deputy's 
parked car was stuck by an SUV. Two people in the SUV were also 
hospitalized as a precaution.

Snow
 amounts could vary greatly as temperatures continue to drop later 
Sunday. But up to 15 inches could fall at higher elevations and 4in to 9in could fall at lower elevations, including Denver and other cities
 along Colorado's Front Range.

'May
 snow certainly isn't unheard of here in Colorado, even down in the 
Denver metro area,' said David Barjenbruch, another weather service 
meteorologist in Boulder.

'If we see the total accumulations that we are
 anticipating from this storm, we are certainly going to see a top 10 
May snow event for the Denver metro area.'

Barjenbruch
 said a foot of snow had already fallen in the foothills of Larimer 
County northwest of Denver by Sunday morning, and workers along much of 
the Front Range can expect a 'slushy, sloppy morning commute' Monday.

The
 weather service also warned that snow could be heavy and wet enough to 
snap tree limbs and power lines, causing power failures. Winds gusting 
up to 30 mph could reduce visibility, and slushy roads could be 
treacherous to drive.

Julie 
Smith, a spokeswoman for Denver International Airport, said crews have 
treated runways in anticipation of dropping temperatures.

'At
 this point we are seeing some delays with our airlines while they are 
getting their deicing operations up and running, and we do expect the 
airlines to be fully deicing in the morning,' she said.

Meanwhile, Denver officials plan to deploy up to 70 snowplows overnight to prepare for Monday's commute.

In
 southern Wyoming, the storm forced transportation officials to close a 
150-mile stretch of Interstate 80 from Cheyenne to Rawlins on Sunday.

The
 weather service said mountainous areas in south-central Wyoming got up 
to 2ft of snow, and the metro areas of Cheyenne and Laramie averaged 6in
 to 10in.

Rob Cox, a weather service meteorologist in Cheyenne, 
said he expects more accumulation overnight, likely an additional 2in to 4in in some locations.

'There will be a lot of water after all this is said and done,' he said, adding that there could be some localized flooding.

In
 the West, high winds at the bottom of the storm sent dust blowing 
across Arizona and New Mexico, and the Los Angeles area had been under 
'red flag' fire warnings, with authorities saying blazes could quickly 
spread out of control under low humidity, gusty winds and dry 
conditions.

The storm is the
 result of a low-pressure system moving east colliding with a cold air 
mass from the north. Spring-like weather was expected to return to the 
Rockies by Tuesday.
