A friend of the newlywed whose wife allegedly pushed him to his death from a cliff just one week after they married has revealed that he was immediately suspicious that she was responsible.

Cameron Fredrickson said he had not been supportive when Cody Lee Johnson, 25, told him he was going to propose to 22-year-old Jordan Linn Graham last year.

After initially claiming she had last seen her husband days before his death, Graham last month admitted to pushing Johnson from a cliff in Montana's Glacier National Park on July 7.

'I almost instantly thought Jordan knew 
something, did something, or was a part of what happened to Cody,' 
Fredrickson told ABC News.

Accused: Jordan Linn Graham, 22, (left) was having second
thoughts about getting married around the time the body of her husband,
Cody Lee Johnson, 25, (right) was discovered

Warnings: Cameron Fredrickson said he told his friend, Cody Lee Johnson, that he should reconsider proposing to Jordan Linn Graham. She has admitted that she pushed Johnson to his death from a cliff

He added that he had been weary of the couple's relationship for a long time.

'When Cody told me that he was going to propose to 
Jordan, I wasn't real supportive of it,' he said. 'I did have a conversation with 
him saying I think he should reconsider.'

He told NBC Montana that he was never close to his friend's wife, whom he found to be 'very closed off, very quiet', and noticed something odd about her during the wedding ceremony.

'I noticed that when they were exchanging their vows, Jordan never once looked at Cody,' he said.

But even though Fredrickson and other friends weren't sure of the match, Johnson never gave any indication anything was wrong.

'Any time that we asked Cody how the relationship was, he always said it was good,' he told CNN.

Graham will today return to a federal courtroom, where she faces second-degree murder charges.

Tragic: The couple had been married for just eight days before Graham, left on her wedding day, pushed him

Trip: Graham posted this photo of herself exploring Glacier National Park in Montana four months ago - just two months before her new husbands death in the same park

Missed: A family friend said Johnson had been excited about his wedding and was in love with Graham

Charging documents suggest Graham was 
having second thoughts about getting married around the time the body of
her husband was discovered.

She told an FBI agent that she and her husband had been arguing on July
7 as they walked in the Loop Trail area of the park.

At one point, she turned to walk away, but Johnson grabbed her arm, she said. She turned around, removed his hand from her arm and 'due to her anger, she pushed Johnson with both hands in the back, and as a result, he fell face first off the cliff,' an affidavit states.

Johnson was reported missing on July 8 when he failed to show up for work.

Days later, Graham reported that she had found his body, which park staff found strange, but she told them she thought to check the area as he had wanted to see it before he died.

Graham told investigators 
that Johnson had left their house late on July 7 with unidentified friends 
in a dark-colored car with Washington state license plates.

That night she texted a friend and said 
she was going to talk to Johnson about her reservations about the marriage. 'I'm going to talk to him,' the text read.

The friend told the FBI she had received the text from Graham just before 9pm and responded: 'I'll pray for you guys.'

Graham replied: 'But dead serious if u don't hear from me at all again tonight, something happened.'

Another friend said Graham reported receiving an email on July 10 saying Johnson had left with three friends, went hiking, had fallen and was dead.

Engagement: Graham posted this photo to Instagram in December 2012 with the caption: 'He proposed!! Best early Christmas present ever!! :)' But friends said they had tried to dissuade him from proposing

Carefree: Graham, who now faces federal charges, poses during a night out before her husband's death

The next day, Graham reported to park 
officials that she had spotted Johnson's body. Graham explained, 'It was a place he wanted to see before 
he died,' authorities said.

Shortly after he died, Graham posted a photo on Instagram from their wedding day.

As
a caption she wrote, 'Miss you so much Cody! Not a day will go by where
I don't think about you!!

'You will live on in my heart forever!! I know
you're in a better place now looking down on me!! You're my angel!! 
Love you with all my heart and soul!! See you again one day!!!'

Friends also expressed their sympathies for the young widow on her Facebook page.

But Graham was interviewed on July 16 and acknowledged lying about her husband's death, authorities said.

Suspicious: Graham reported to park officials that she had found Johnson's body. A ranger thought that was unusual, but Graham explained: 'It was a place he wanted to see before he died'

Loved ones expressed their shock at the confession and said that Johnson had been excited about his wedding.

Graham's friend Lytaunie Blasdel added to ABC News that she could not believe the news.

'I
never ever expected her to be capable of hurting someone,' Blasdel 
said. 'Especially someone who would worship her. He would have given her
anything at the drop of a hat.'

According
to Graham's social media accounts, the couple got engaged in December 
2012. She tweeted a photo of the ring and wrote, 'He proposed!! Best 
early Christmas present ever!!'
