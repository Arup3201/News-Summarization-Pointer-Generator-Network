Anti-austerity demonstrators clashed with riot police in Madrid last night.

More than 1,000 officers blocked off access to the parliament building after protesters vowed to ‘occupy Congress’ in the heart of the Spanish capital.

Police baton-charged the crowd and there were reports that protesters were being beaten by officers.

Thousands of protesters, enraged by cutbacks and tax hikes, had taken to the streets.

The demonstration drew protesters weary of nine straight months of painful measures imposed by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.

Thousands of angry marchers yelled toward parliament, 250 yards away, “Get out!, Get out! They don’t represent us! Fire them!”

“The only solution is that we should put everyone in Parliament out on the street so they know what it’s like,” said one of the protesters, civil servant Maria Pilar Lopez.

Spain is said to be on the verge of getting a bailout from Europe as its economy limps from one crisis to another. It is struggling in its second recession in three years.

The banks hold billions in toxic debts from the property boom and unemployment stands at more than 25 per cent.

The country introduced austerity measures and economic reforms in a bid to convince its euro partners and investors that it is serious about reducing its bloated deficit to 6.3 per cent of gross domestic product in 2012 and 4.5 per cent next year.

Spain has been under pressure from investors to apply for European Central Bank assistance in keeping its borrowing costs down.

Rajoy has yet to say whether Madrid will apply for the aid, reluctant to ask since such assistance comes with strings attached.

The demonstration in Madrid comes ahead of a general strike planned today in Greece.
