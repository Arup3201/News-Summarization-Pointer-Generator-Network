A newlywed recently announced on his blog that he's come to a conclusion: marriage is not for him.

However, rather than being met with a chorus of disapproval, Seth Adam Smith's piece has been read almost four million times, and his wife is in full agreement with his sentiments.

'Having been married only a year and a half, I've recently come to the conclusion that marriage isn't for me,' he writes.

The viral story of the moment is spreading like wildfire, possibly because of its click-bait title.

The loaded title, 'Marriage Isn't For You' and the opening gambit is enough to intrigue the many readers who have shared it via social media such as Facebook and Twitter.

But Smith, a Mormon, takes a very different turn to the one most readers are expecting.

How? Well, what Seth Adam Smith is getting at is, his marriage isn't about him.

'No, a true marriage (and true love) is never about you. It's about the person you love - their wants, their needs, their hopes, and their dreams. Selfishness demands, "What's in it for me?" while Love asks, "What can I give?"' he writes.

The Alaskan-born Florida resident says he and his wife Kim met when they were just 15 years old.

They were friends for 10 years before their relationship became something more, and a year-and-a-half ago, they got married.

'The nearer Kim and I approached the decision to marry, the more I was filled with a paralyzing fear. Was I ready? Was I making the right choice? Was Kim the right person to marry? Would she make me happy?' he writes.

A conversation with his father put paid to any doubts Smith had about his upcoming nuptials.

'Seth, you’re being totally selfish. So I’m going to make this really simple: marriage isn’t for you. You don’t marry to make yourself happy, you marry to make someone else happy,' Smith's father told him.

'More than that, your marriage isn’t for yourself, you’re marrying for a family. Not just for the in-laws and all of that nonsense, but for your future children. Who do you want to help you raise them? Who do you want to influence them? Marriage isn’t for you. It’s not about you. Marriage is about the person you married,' he said.

The blogger and editor-in-chief of ForwardWalking.com has tried to carry his father's advice with him through his first months of marriage.

His message about the nature of true love and marriage has struck a chord with many of those who have read it and it's been reprinted everywhere from HuffPost to Desert News. Smith says the story has had almost four million hits.

One commenter wrote, 'Loved it! After 15 years of marriage, and several near misses with that grey line in the affair department, my husband finally figured that out... I finally was ready to walk away...  He would now tell you he was so wrong and not thinking about that other ‘person’ he should have been taking care of – our marriage.'

Another tweeted, 'Thanks for posting that "marriage isn't for you" article it changed my mind on that archaic, disenfranchising, and oppressive tradition!'

It's also received backlash from cynics for its simplistic view of marriage and the author's relatively short one.

'One of the most overrated institutions on the planet. Only makes sense if you don't have a Will,' wrote a commentator on HuffPost.

'Marriage isn't for men, with the divorce laws, child support and alimony what man wants to get married,' said another.

'And marriage isn't for women either, because in most cases you just end up being a nanny, nurse, housekeeper, second income, etc,' came the retort.

'Sounds like a nice sentiment. Could not help but thinking though that it would have a lot more credibility if the author had made it past the 2 year mark first... It can be a lot more difficult than you ever expected despite good intentions and a lot of hard work. People can be unpredictable over the long haul,' wrote another.

Cosmopolitan magazine responded with an article entitled, 'Stop lying, marriage is for you,' which argued that marrying someone you love because it will make your life better isn't a bad thing.

As for Smith himself, he told Deseret News that he and his wife endured a 'rough patch' as recently as two weeks ago, and the article was a 'cathartic' response to that.

The couple will celebrate their second anniversary in April 2014.
