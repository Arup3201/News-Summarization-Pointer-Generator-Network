'Mediocre': Some students were not pleased that Prince William will be allowed to study at Cambridge after achieving only ABC at A-Level

Cambridge students have rounded on Prince William for getting a 'free pass' place at Cambridge University, while falling short of their usual exacting standards.

The Duke of Cambridge, 31, was admitted to the prestigious institution for a 10-week 'bespoke' course in agricultural management, which will see him study for 18 to 20 hours a week at part of the university's school of Technology.

But students and graduates were quick to point out that the Prince's 'mediocre' results from his A-Level studies at Eton were not up to the standards of the average Cambridge student.

While the university now asks for two A grades and an A* at A-Level in order to study undergraduate courses - with even harsher offers for some - Prince William only achieved ABC in his studies.

University newspaper The Tab noted in its report: 'The Tab must point out that normally students need A*AA at A-level to gain entry to Cambridge University, whilst the Prince only achieved a mediocre ABC.'

Entry requirements for postgraduates such as the Prince - who already holds a geography degree from St Andrew's university - are not the same as for younger students. But his acceptance on the course has still been described as an 'insult' to everybody studying there.

Melissa Berrill, who graduated with a Cambridge degree in French and German this summer, wrote in the Guardian that his presence would make it harder for the university to shake off its 'posh' image and attract less privileged students.

She said: 'Admitting Prince William is an insult to every student, whatever their background, who got into Cambridge by getting the required A-level or degree results.'

'It's an insult to every student whose A-levels and degree are the same or better than his, and who didn't get a free pass to Cambridge in spite of them.

Prestigious: Undergraduate students admitted to Cambridge usually require AAA* at A-Level

'And it's an insult to everyone in the country who needs skills or training, and hasn't had a university course personally designed for them.'

However, many students welcomed the news of Cambridge's newest royal. Charlotte Ivers, a first-year Philosophy student, described his arrival as 'a joyous coup' that would bring the university 'a lot of publicity in return'.

She added: 'Has Oxford educated the next two monarchs of our great nation? Hell no.'

The Prince continues a family tradition 
by studying at Cambridge. His father Prince Charles graduated with a 
degree in Archaeology and Anthropology in 1970, and George VI was also a
 student there. Prince Phillip was Chancellor of the university from 
1976 to 2011.

A Kensington Palace spokesman said that Prince William is likely to spend two or three nights a week in Cambridge while studying.

The Duke will not be awarded any qualification at the end of the course, which he is set to finish in mid-March.

An aide said: â€˜Like his father, the Duke is very much a countryman, he enjoys and is passionate about the countryside and its people.
