Just two months after it took aim at the McDonald's breakfast menu by offering menu items like the 'Waffle Taco,' Taco Bell is trying its hand at semi-fast food geared towards diners with palettes a bit more sophisticated than those of the chain's typical 'Open Late' crowd.

Taco Bell is planning to test the waters of the fancier, fast-casual restaurant scene with a new restaurant called U.S. Taco Co. and Urban Tap Room.

In addition to fancier food, the new restaurants will also have booze.

Fancy: U.S. Taco Co. will feature fancier menu items than Taco Bell, like fusion-inspired tacos and booze-infused milkshakes

Fast-casual: U.S. Taco Co. is gearing its menu towards foodies, with fresher, more-sophisticated tacos than Taco Bell

The menu features fancier tacos than the typical Taco Bell patron might be used to - fancier, fusion tacos replace re-heated ground beef and shredded cheddar cheese.

According to the Los Angeles Times, the new restaurant will feature a take on a Philly favorite, with its 'Brotherly Love' cheesesteak taco made with a flour tortilla, carne asada steak, grilled peppers and onions, roasted poblano queso, cotija cheese and cilantro.

Then there's the Southern-inspired taco, the 'Winner Winner taco with a flour tortilla, home-style crispy chicken, 'SOB' Southern gravy, roasted corn pico de gallo, jalapeno and cilantro.

'A year ago, we conducted an extensive study on our consumer 
segmentation and identified a separate consumer group that simply was 
not going to visit quick service restaurants, at all,' Jeff Jenkins, 
Taco Bell senior brand manager, said in a statement. 'The result is U.S.
 Taco, a new concept sit-down restaurant that offers the best fusion of 
American-inspired flavors in tacos, fries and shakes for that emerging 
demographic of edgy foodies looking for a unique dining experience.'

Trial: Taco Bell will launch its first fast-casual restaurant, U.S. Taco Co. (pictured) in California's Huntington Beach, and depending on its reception, could expand to other locations

Think outside the bun: The new restaurant concept comes just months after Taco Bell introduced a breakfast menu to compete with McDonald's

The U.S. Taco Co. menu also has fancy fries with habanero dust, ghost chile ketchup and roasted poblano crema, as well as carne 
asada fries, made with an order of 'Papas Fritas' topped with carne 
asada, a four-cheese blend, queso, avocado, salsa, roasted poblano 
queso, pico de gallo, cotija cheese and cilantro.

Then there's the booze - in addition to beer and wine, there's also a booze-infused milkshake called the 'Mexican Car Bomb,' which is made with vanilla ice cream, tequila caramel sauce, chocolate flakes and Guinness stout.

The first U.S. Taco Co. will be in Huntington Beach, California, and is slated to open in the next few months. However, Taco Bell Chief Executive Greg Creed tells the OC Register, 'I would love one day to see 1,000 of these. But let’s not get that far ahead of ourselves. We’re opening a restaurant and seeing what happens.'
