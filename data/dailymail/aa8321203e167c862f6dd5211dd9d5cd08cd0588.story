President Obama has replaced Republican Mitt Romney as the most popular target for comedians, a study has revealed.

Researchers who studied jokes made by late-night comedians during the first half of the year found far more gags were aimed at Obama and the Democrats than in the previous year.

Obama was the target of 288 gags made by Jay Leno, David Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, Craig Ferguson and Jimmy Kimmel, according to an analysis by the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University.Â

The second most joked-about individual was New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, at 120.

But as the study was conducted before Weiner's second sexting scandal had come to light, the number of jokes aimed at him is expected to have jumped dramatically in recent weeks.

In 2012, Mitt Romney was the butt of more than twice as many jokes as Obama, and Republicans were similarly the target of more than double the jokes that were made on Democrats.

But between January and June 2013, Democrats were the target of 713 jokes, compared to 417 gags about Republicans, the study said.

The only Republicans among the top 10 joke targets were former President George W Bush and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

Change: Even David Letterman, who has traditionally targeted the Republicans, made 102 jokes about Democrats in the first half of 2012

Gags: Jimmy Fallon was the toughest comic on Democrats, targeting them 240 times compared to 76 for Republicans

But Robert Lichter, the CMPA's president, said the findings 'don't illustrate any political change of heart among late-night comics.'

He added: 'The jokes follow the news, and with Republicans receding after an election campaign, Obama presented more opportunities.

'They're going after the most visible and powerful people that they can.'

Even Letterman, who is generally harder on Republicans, couldn't resist joining in with jokes aimed at the Democrats.

Referring to the recent revelations that government authorities had been listening to calls made by civilians, he said: 'People always say to me, they say, "Hey, Letterman," they say. "Why don't you make jokes about Obama?" And I say, "All right, I'll tell you why. I don't make jokes about him because I don't want the FBI tapping my phone."'

While Leno tapped has joked about claims the IRS was politically targeting conservative groups, saying: 'I was going to start off tonight with an Obama joke, but I don't want to get audited by the IRS, so forget that.'

Fallon was the toughest comic on 
Democrats, targeting them 240 times compared to 76 for Republicans. 
Letterman had 139 jokes about Republicans and 102 about Democrats, the 
CMPA found.

Obama will appear on Leno's Tonight show on Tuesday.
