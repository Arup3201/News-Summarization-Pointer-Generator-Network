The childhood home of novelist Dame Daphne Du Maurier has been put on the market for £32million.

Cannon Hall, where the English author and playwright moved with her family when she was nine years old, is a six-bedroom, Grade II-listed home near Hampstead Heath in north London.

The family moved to the 18th century home in 1916 and the Rebecca author's father, actor Sir Gerald du Maurier, lived there until his death in 1934.

Stately: Daphne du Maurier's childhood home in Hampstead Heath, north London, which she moved into when she was nine, has gone on the market for £32million

Rich history: One of the five reception areas in the huge home, where actor Sir Gerald du Maurier lived from 1916 until his death in 1934

Pride of London: The home has been described as one of the finest in London, and boats a billiards room as well as a separate cottage in the grounds

The stately home, which dates from 1730 and is set among half an acre of land, was also used for filming Otto Preminger's 1965  thriller Bunny Lake Is Missing, starring Laurence Olivier.

The house has three floors, and boasts an indoor swimming pool, a billiards room, five reception rooms and a separate cottage for staff.

There is a former coachman's house with stables in the courtyard which has a weatherboard clock and turret. 

A blue plaque honouring Sir Gerald sits on an outside wall of the house he shared with his wife, the actress Muriel Beaumont. 

Ornate: The mid-eighteenth century style staircase, with twisted balusters and carved brackets, leads up to the gallery landing, which overlooks the hall below

Splashing out: The house, which has an indoor swimming pool, will cost any  buyer £32million, plus huge annual fees if Labour's mansion tax comes into force

Honoured: A blue plaque on the outside of the house to mark Sir Gerald du Maurier, Daphne's father, whose own father George was a Punch cartoonist

The current owners have now put Cannon Hall on the market with Glentree International and Savills for £32 million - making it one of the most expensive properties for sale in the capital.

Prospective buyers also face an extra in £2million in stamp duty, plus a whopping annual bill if Labour were to introduce a 'mansion tax'.

Trevor Abrahmsohn, boss of Glentree International, described Cannon Hall as 'one of the most cherished and historic residences in Hampstead'.

He added: 'It must rank as one of the prize gems of the English Heritage stable.

'It is steeped in provenance and this is more an opportunity to buy a property that has remained in private hands for many decades than just another trophy home for sale.

Perfect setting: The mansion has half an acre of  beautiful gardens, but is also just four miles from London's West End

The grand entrance hall, which extends nearly the depth of the house, and the wide staircase are two of Cannon Hall's most impressive and distinguishing features.

The staircase, created in the mid-eighteenth century style with twisted balusters and carved brackets, leads up to the gallery landing, which overlooks the hall below.

Frank Townsend, from Savills, said: 'Cannon Hall is one of London's finest period homes.

'The property is located less than 50 yards from the rolling acres of Hampstead Heath, yet less than four miles from the heart of London's West End.

'There are only a handful of properties in Hampstead with the physical stature of Cannon Hall - and with the du Maurier and Olivier connections as well, certainly makes it the most iconic of them all.' 

Daphne du Maurier was born in 1907 to two famous actors - Sir Gerald du Maurier and Muriel Beaumont. Her elder sister Angela also became a writer, and her younger sister Jeanne was an artist.

Her grandfather, George du Maurier, was a French-born cartoonist and author,  best known for his cartoons in Punch - so the future Dame du Maurier came from a rich history of extremely talented creative minds.

Now, she is perhaps most famous of them all. Some of her most popular works include Jamaica Inn (1936) and Rebecca (1938), both of which have been made into hit films - Rebecca even won an Oscar for Best Picture in 1941.

Du Maurier was born in London and moved into Cannon Hall when she was nine. Some of her early work was published in her mother's magazine Bystander, which helped get her career going.

Her first novel, The Loving Spirit, was published in 1931, and she went on to have almost 30 more works of fiction published, including novels The Scapegoat, The House on the Strand, and The King's General, and short story The Birds.

She was often called a romantic novelist, though hated the term herself, and many of her stories did not follow the traditional format of a romantic novel in that they did not have happy endings.

Her short stories, meanwhile, were often works of terror, and some were said to be ahead of their time. This includes The Doll, a tale she wrote when she was 21 about a mechanical sex doll.

Du Maurier also ventured into play writing - she adapted Rebecca for the stage, and  wrote two others, The Years Between and September Tide.

She moved into non-fiction as she got older, writing biographies of her own ancestry.

She married Major Frederick Browning, who later became a Lieutenant General, in 1932, and had three children with him.  

She died on April 19, 1989, aged 81, at her home in Cornwall.
