All party leaders dream of getting their hands on the keys to Number 10.

But David Cameron has emerged as the most popular party leader families would like to seeing moving in next door to them.

The Prime Minister topped a poll of which senior politicians people would most like to have as a neighbour, although Ukip's Nigel Farage was the most popular among the under-25s.

With fewer than 60 days until the general election on May 7, attention is focussing on the party leaders as they set out their pitch to voters.

While policies will always be important, the personality of the leader could be key to securing the support of swing voters.

A new YouGov opinion poll sought to find out which party leader UK homeowners would most like to have as a neighbour.

Among those who expressed a view - excluding don't knows - Mr Cameron came out on top with 31 per cent, well ahead of his Labour rival Ed Miliband on 23 per cent and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg on 20 per cent.

Nigel Farage, who has boasted he is on course to make big gains in May's election, was the preferred choice of just 18 per cent. Green party leader Natalie Bennett was favoured by only 10 per cent of homeowners

Mr Farage, who has boasted he is on course to make big gains in May's election, was the preferred choice of just 18 per cent.

And Green party leader Natalie Bennett, who has been criticised for faltering media performances, was favoured by only 10 per cent of homeowners.

Mr Farage, who once sparked controversy for saying people would be concerned if a group of Romanians moved in next door, was the top choice of the 18-24-year-olds, backed by 25 per cent.

But the Ukip leader slumped to fourth place among the 25-34 and 35-44 age group, but was third for 45-54 and 55+ voters.

Living next door to Mr Farage proved popular with men, but women prefer Mr Clegg or Mr Miliband, according to the survey carried out by The House Shop.

A spokesman said: 'The likeability contest between the prospective leaders of our country is well underway, as the party leaders launch their charm offensive in the run-up to the General Election in May. 

'The polls so far have been tight, with Labour and the Conservatives battling for the top spot and the Greens and Lib Dems fighting it out to avoid last place. 

'It seems that Nigel Farage’s cheeky, cheerful, pint-drinking image has made him top of the list as a preferred neighbour for young people, with under 25s shunning Cameron, Clegg and Miliband in favour of the UKIP leader. 

'Natalie Bennett of the Green Party came in last place overall, with 10% of the total vote. Natalie faired slightly better with Scottish and Welsh homeowners, earning 12% and overtaking Nigel Farage who was pushed down into last place with 9% of Scottish and Welsh votes.'
