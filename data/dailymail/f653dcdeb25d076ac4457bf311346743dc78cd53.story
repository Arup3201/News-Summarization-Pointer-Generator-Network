Farmers fear that cheap eggs produced in cruel battery cages on European farms are about to flood into Britain.

The cages, in which up to six hens are crammed together with no room to flap their wings, forage or scratch, are to be banned from January 1.

But while British farmers have spent £400million complying with the new EU-wide law, those in 13 other countries have refused to get rid of the tiny cages.

Because Brussels has not backed up the new law with fines, penalties or an export ban, there is nothing to stop farmers who flout it from selling their eggs in Britain.

That means British farmers, who  have gone to great expense to meet the deadline to get rid of the cages, could  find they are undercut and even forced out of business.

At the same time, British customers could end up supporting illegally produced eggs by buying from food manufacturers and restaurants who use them. The Government has tried to deal with the issue by asking supermarkets and manufacturers to sign up to a voluntary code not to use the battery cage eggs. However, EU law prevents any tougher action such as an import ban.

Animal welfare campaigners and the National Farmers’ Union have condemned both the EU and Westminster authorities for failing to enforce the ban.

‘If nothing is done to stop these illegal eggs coming in to the UK  it could be seen as rewarding  producers who are still using cruel conventional battery cages,’ said Alice Clark, senior scientist from the RSPCA.

‘There is a real danger that shoppers will unwittingly buy illegal eggs, which will not even meet minimum welfare standards.

‘It will be particularly difficult to trace illegal eggs when they’ve  been used as ingredients in foods such as ready meals, sandwiches, cakes and Yorkshire puddings, where they don’t have to be  labelled with production system or country of origin.’

NFU poultry board chairman Charles Bourns said British farmers were ‘bitterly disappointed’ that the sale and import of battery cage eggs had not been banned.

He said: ‘We are concerned that although the Government has repeatedly pledged its support  for the industry, it cannot  prohibit the use of illegal egg  products and food manufactured from such products.’

Farming minister Jim Paice said: ‘It is unacceptable that after  the ban on battery cages comes into effect, around 50million hens across Europe will still remain  in poor conditions. It would  be unthinkable if countries continuing to house hens in poor  conditions were to profit from flouting the law.’

While the new regime outlaws the smallest battery cages, this is not the end of hens being locked in together. A new system of so-called enriched cages, which allow more room and perches, is endorsed by authorities in the UK and Europe.
