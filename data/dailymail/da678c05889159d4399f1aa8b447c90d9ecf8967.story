Controversial documentary The Romanians Are Coming has been condemned by Romanian MPs  for inciting 'hatred and discrimination' of migrants.

Ion Jinga, the Romanian ambassador in London, wrote to Channel 4 accusing the producers of reinforcing negative stereotypes.

Three members of the Romanian parliament also wrote to the British ambassador in Bucharest asking what the reaction would be if they made a programme saying all Brits were alcoholics and paedophiles.

In a letter seen by the Observer, they said: 'We kindly ask you to consider what your reaction would be if TVR, the Romanian public television channel, would launch a campaign of denigration pointed towards the British citizens in our country, generalising cases of alcoholism and paedophilia displayed by some British citizens (cases we are sure you are aware of), and turning them into the general image of all British citizens in Romania.

'The documentary broadcast by Channel 4 does the exact same thing.' 

The letter sent by President of United Romania Party, MP Bogdan Diaconu, his vice president MP Virgil Guran, and MP Paul Dumbrăvanu, also said the documentary is wrong in 'every respect' about the Romanian.

'The affront brought to the Romanians living in the United Kingdom must stop immediately, as it will encourage xenophobia and will prejudice our citizens in a direct manner,' it said. 

Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta and his foreign minister also expressed unhappiness over the show which could 'negatively and unfairly' affect the Romanian community in the UK.  

Channel 4 said the documentary, which ended on Tuesday, explored the lives of Romanians 'trying to make a new life in Britain' and seeking out the truth behind the headlines about immigration'.

The first programme followed Alex, who lived in a car park next to Victoria station in London, and a Romany man who struggled to settle in Liverpool. 

The second and third episodes examined the motivation driving migrants to the UK. 

Around 200 people held a silent demonstration in front of Channel 4's studios protesting against what they said was the unfair portrayal of Romanians as criminals. 

Two petitions demanding for the show to be cancelled appeared on Change.org after the first episode aired and they have attracted almost 10,000 signatures.

One said: 'The Romanians Are Coming is purposely dehumanising and through its misleading nature it is used to promote a false image of Romania and it's people in the mind of others.'

The Romanian Prime Minister  expressed solidarity with the protesters and people who signed the petitions.

Romanian Foreign minister Bogdan Aurescu wrote a letter to his British counterpart Philip Hammond saying he regrets the resurfacing of 'incorrect stereotypes'. 

'We deeply regret the resurfacing of incorrect stereotypes of the Romanian community in the UK as reported in the Channel 4 documentary, by presenting only cases which are not entirely representative,' he said. 

'Such documentaries could negatively and unfairly affect the image of the Romanian community in the UK,' he added.

Bristol's Romanian consulate also issued a statement saying that local Romanians felt humiliated.

The migrant population in England is estimated to have increased by more than half a million in three years, research from the University of Oxford has revealed.

Around two thirds of the 565,000 migrants thought to have come to the country between 2011 and 2014 were born in other EU countries, the study by the university's Migration Observatory said.

A spokesman for C4 said: 'This sensitively handled series confronts, head on, many of the stereotypes and widely held prejudices about Romanians coming to the UK by providing an honest account of the experience of different individuals attempting to make a life in Britain.

'The series makes it clear, throughout, that the majority of Romanians in the UK are professionals with guaranteed jobs who pay their taxes and contribute to the British economy.'
