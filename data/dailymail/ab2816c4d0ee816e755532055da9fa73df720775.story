There are not many brave enough to get on the back of a 2,000lbs bucking bull - and definitely not many 5ft5in girls - but there is at least one, and she is doing pretty well for herself.

Maggie Parker is the world's only female bull rider to compete professionally in the men's category and although she is only 20 years old, she is considered a veteran, having competed in nearly 200 rodeos.

Despite her slender frame, Maggie, from Michigan, USA, regularly takes on bulls that weigh in excess of 2,000lbs - over 15 times her own size.

Pro buckaroo: Maggie Parker's unusual choice of career has seen her become the world's only female pro bullrider to compete against men

Maggie, who 
weighs 130lbs, became professional last June after tackling a 
bucking bull for the full eight seconds needed to qualify as a pro.

The fact that professional bull riding is considered one of the world's most dangerous sports has not deterred Maggie from putting 100 per cent into her hobby.

She said: ‘Bull riding is one of the most dangerous sports because you're up against an animal and you don't know what he is going to do or what he's thinking.

‘You will get bulls that are meaner than others but you really have to respect them. You can't ride against them, you have to ride with them.’

Maggie's path to the bull ring began 
four years ago in her hometown of Shastsburg, Michigan, when a family friend who used to ride bulls took her to a rodeo and she was hooked.

Ready to do: Maggie prepares her ropes by adding rosin, making it sticky enough to get a better grip for holding on while being bucked by the bull before heading for the chute in Santa Maria, California

Hold on tight: Maggie needs to stay on the bull for eight seconds in order to score in a rodeo

Bull-ied: Although Maggie is barely 5ft 5in, she regularly takes on bulls that weigh over 2,000 lbs

Going, going, gone: Maggie has her rope in a rights grip and tries to hold her balance aboard the animal as the bull runs and bucks

Aged 17 she left home to live in the 
southern states, working on ranches in Oklahoma and Texas to fund her 
bull riding training, and recently moved to Santa Maria, California, to be trained by top mentor Gary Leffew.

Maggie says her parents are supportive of her unusual career path - despite the obvious dangers.

But desite winning plaudits as a female in a predominantly male sport, Maggie says she still faces difficulties in being accepted - especially when she gets bucked off a bull.

She
said: ‘They [men] say, "This is why girls shouldn't ride bulls and 
girls aren't made for this." But it all depends on the person.

‘You're
either a good bull rider or you're not. It takes a long time to gain 
people's respect and get treated the same as the men.

‘Sometimes
it's been harder for me because when you're learning how to ride a bull
you're going to get bucked off - and you're going to get hurt. It's 
just not going to look very pretty while you're riding.’

She now wears a full face mask and helmet to protect her, but revealed she has suffered being stood on by the bulls and endured knocks to the head.

Devotion: Maggie shows off her own tribute to her chosen sport - a back-tattoo of herself on a bucking bull

Maggie, who says she is just as 
comfortable in a summer dress as she is in her Stetsons, said: ‘If I 
didn't wear my helmet I'd probably be a vegetable by now because I've 
been hit in the head.’

To keep on top of her sport, Maggie does ranch work, conducts regular 
workouts at the gym and practices techniques on a stationary barrel.

Speaking
of his protege, Maggie's trainer Gary Leffew, who has coached 12 world 
champions, said: ‘She wasn't very good when she came to me but she had 
grit.

‘That's what I admire about her. She ain't got no quit in her - she's determined and she works long and hard on it.’
