Maureen Robb, 58, from Arbroath, suffered excruciating headaches

Maureen Robb's headaches were so excruciating that they left her face partly paralysed and she could barely talk.

During particularly bad attacks, her eyelids drooped and her jaw dropped.

'I've suffered from headaches all my life,' says Maureen, 58, a retired supermarket cashier from Arbroath in Scotland. 'Even as a baby my mum told me I used to cradle my head and cry uncontrollably. As soon as I was old enough, about three years old, I was able to tell her I had headaches on the left side of my head. She took me to scores of doctors but they didn't know what was causing the pain.'

For years Maureen depended on strong painkillers, which she 'popped like Smarties', taking up to six a day despite her concerns about any long-term damage.

'I could never accept invites to social events because I wouldn't know how I'd be feeling. I'd usually hide in bed when my headache was really bad,' recalls the grandmother-of-three.

But for the past two years Maureen hasn't needed headache pills - instead she's kept the pain at bay with a device that delivers a mild electric current into her neck.

The portable hand-held device, called gammaCore, sends small electric pulses into the vagus nerve, which runs from the brain to the abdomen and relays messages to and from the heart, lungs and digestive system.

These messages activate chemical neurotransmitters in the brain. There are different kinds of messengers and one theory is that people who suffer from severe frequent headaches may produce too many neurotransmitters and as a result, sensations that are not normally painful are misinterpreted by the brain, causing headaches.

The gammaCore is thought to reduce levels of certain neurotransmitters. It has been developed to relieve migraines as well as cluster headaches (brief but extremely painful and debilitating headaches that can recur up to several times a day, for weeks or months).

Maureen was prescribed the gammaCore by her specialist, Professor Peter Goadsby, a neurologist, and Dr Juana Marin, a headache specialist, both at King's College Hospital, London.

Professor Goadsby's been leading research into the safety and efficacy of the device for different types of headaches since 2012 - in a year-long pilot clinical trial, 15 out of 19 cluster headache patients reported an overall improvement in pain levels and frequency of attacks of more than 50 per cent after regularly using gammaCore.

The findings were presented at the International Headache Congress in Boston in September and larger studies are under way.

Maureen was initially referred to Professor Goadsby in 2004. Before seeing him, she'd been given many different tablets for her headaches, including medicines used for depression (some, such as lithium, can sometimes control pain), as well as epilepsy drugs (which can suppress the over-activity in the brain involved in headaches). But these only dulled her pain and wore off after a few hours. She'd also been prescribed injections of morphine, and anti-inflammatory medications such as steroids and diclofenac, which are used as painkillers for certain conditions including migraines.

'I feared one day my organs would just pack up, I was having so much heavy-duty medication,' says Maureen. 'Doctors told me to try to cut down the amount because of the long-term side-effects steroids can cause, such as osteoporosis.'

When she first saw Professor Goadsby he ran tests that showed that she was suffering from hemicrania continua, a rare type of headache that causes constant pain. He prescribed indomethacin, a drug known to help with these headaches. But while her headaches lifted, after a few weeks she had to stop taking the pills due to severe side-effects, including a stomach ulcer.

Maureen then had an electronic device surgically implanted into her neck that delivered electrical stimulation to the brain through the occipital nerve, which runs from the base of the skull to the spine, and conducts pain.

The device worked for two years until the batteries ran out (they weren't replaced as she was testing it as part of a clinical trial) - sending Maureen into despair once more. Then in 2012 Professor Goadsby prescribed the gammaCore. The technology was originally developed to treat conditions such as epilepsy, but then patients reported it also eased their headaches.

'It isn't a cure but gammaCore works miracles,' says Maureen

To use the device, a conductive gel is applied to the surfaces of the device and it is placed on the neck. The treatment, which takes about two minutes, produces a tingling or pricking feeling.

Potential side-effects, although rare, include hoarseness, shortness of breath, or a change in voice while the treatment is being given (because of the effect on the vagus nerve).

However, these are usually temporary and stop when two minutes are up. Maureen says the treatment made a significant difference within three months, reducing the severity and frequency of her headaches. She now uses gammaCore as a preventative measure three times a day.

'I still have a constant low-level headache, but it is nothing compared with the hell I used to experience,' she says, adding that she has not needed medication for two years.

'GammaCore has transformed my life. In the past my headaches were so bad I'd rather give birth three times than suffer from one. It isn't a cure but gammaCore works miracles. I now love entertaining my three grandchildren, which I couldn't do before.'

The gammaCore is not suitable for patients with a pacemaker or hearing aid implant, as it emits a mild electrical current. It should also not be used by people who are diagnosed with narrowing of the arteries in the neck (carotid atherosclerosis) or those who have had surgery to cut the vagus nerve in their neck.

The device has been licensed for treatment of migraines and cluster headaches, and while the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is considering approving funding, it is only available on the NHS for patients with exceptional circumstances.

GammaCore is available privately, but at about Â£300 a month, it is not cheap (the device needs to be replaced monthly when the batteries run out though the manufacturer is working on a rechargeable device).

Dr Mark Weatherall, a consultant neurologist at Charing Cross Hospital, London, said: 'For many patients, non-invasive neurostimulation offers an exciting and acceptable alternative to standard painkillers. Early results of trials with the gammaCore are promising, and further studies are eagerly awaited.'
