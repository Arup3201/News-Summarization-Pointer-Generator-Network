Bayern Munich midfielder Mario Gotze has revealed he would open to a move abroad if the opportunity presented itself.

The 22-year-old, who scored Germany's winning goal in this summer's World Cup final against Argentina, had been linked with Manchester United before moving to Bayern from Borussia Dortmund in 2013.

Having remained in his home country, Gotze admits a move away from Germany could appeal to him.
