It's the hospital where the surgeons fix missing limbs, repaint eyes and grow back the hair on some of Australia and New Zealand's most precious and well-loved possessions.

The Doll Hospital in Sydney has restored more than three million beloved dolls and teddy bears across the country for more than 100 years.

Geoff Chapman, 67, whose grandfather started the hospital in 1913, now continues the traditional family business –which restores a variety of toys from porcelain and antiques to the common rag doll - with the help of up to 12 other staff.

'We're one of the last ones that does everything, when it comes to dolls, there's very few that are capable of that sort of work,' Mr Chapman told Reuters.

'We've had customers who've burst into tears when they saw their treasured doll or teddy as good as new.'

The hospital was first set up by Harold Chapman Senior when a shipping mishap led the rubber bands holding together some celluloid dolls from Japan tear, forcing Harold to find a way to repair them.

The business blossomed from there, booming during World War Two when restrictions on manufactured and imported goods meant new dolls were not easy to come by, forcing children to repair what they had rather than buy anew.

Children were thus forced to repair what they had rather than buy anew. At this point, the hospital had 70 staff members working across six workrooms

Now however, Mr Chapman says the majority of the hospital's work comes from older customers hoping to restore their childhood memories in order to pass them on to younger generations.

'I would say about 80 per cent of our work comes from 'big children,' he said.

'When they were children they possibly only got one doll, not a new doll every time you go down the supermarket like it happens today. That's why it's so emotional.

'It's both men and women, obviously more women are getting dolls and teddies repaired, but there's quite a few men attached to teddy bears too.'

Kerry Stuart, who has worked at the hospital for more than 25 years compared her work to surgery, especially when it comes to dolls made from delicate materials.

'A lot of our tools are like surgeons', operating on human patients,' she said.

'The thing I like least is eyes. It's a very difficult balancing act to get them right, so it does take a while. Sometimes I have to do them three times before I'm happy with them,' she said.

But with today's  consumerist culture, the hospital is seeing less and less patients turn up at their doors.

Nonetheless, their work is truly an art form, a vanishing skill that each worker remains greatly enthusiastic about.

'My bear has lost his eyes, nose, mouth and some filling, can you fix him and how long will it take?' one question on their website reads.

The reply: 'Yes we can add some new filling to his body, to fatten him up again. We can supply and attach glass eyes, so he will see again and we can also stitch a new nose and mouth for him too smell and taste again with. He will also come home with a beautiful new ribbon around his neck to brighten him up!'

The hospital recently replied to a querie about fixing a teddy with the following:' 'Yes we can add some new filling to his body, to fatten him up again. We can supply and attach glass eyes, so he will see again and we can also stitch a new nose and mouth for him too smell and taste again with'
