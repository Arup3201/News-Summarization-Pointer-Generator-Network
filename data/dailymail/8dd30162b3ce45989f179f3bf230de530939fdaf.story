Tom O'Neill, pictured with his daughter Lucy, was struck down by the rare condition Guillain-Barre Syndrome after suffering a bout of man flu

A teacher who was left paralysed after a bout of 'man flu' has taught himself to walk again.

Tom O'Neill, from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, picked up a runny nose and cough from one of his pupils.

When he complained about feeling under the weather, his wife Hayley told him to stop exaggerating his symptoms.

But within days, the maths teacher's condition had deteriorated.

Mr O'Neill, 27, found himself unable to move his legs, and the paralysis crept across his body, rendering him unable to move.

He slipped into a coma while in hospital, as doctors worked to determine what was causing his body to shut down.

They discovered Mr O'Neill's cold had triggered a rare nerve condition, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) - which normally develops from a virus or infection and affects just 1,500 people a year in the UK.

Remarkably Mr O'Neill has battled back from the illness, and after re-learning to walk, he is preparing to return to work.

He said: 'I thought I just had a bad cold - my wife and I even joked it was a bad bout of 'man flu'.

'It did get quite bad and I went to a couple of walk-in centres, but the staff there just told me I had a virus, so I thought I'd best man up.

'Normally I'm a fit and healthy guy. I play loads of sport and stay active. I very rarely get sick but I turned out to have pneumonia in one lung and then the GBS started.

'I gradually lost all the feeling in my hands and feet, then my legs and forearms.

'But then it got the point where I was almost completely paralysed. I was gasping for air.

'It was so scary - I don't even remember a lot of my early time in hospital.

'The nurses told me it was one of the most severe cases they'd seen but it was also one of the fastest recoveries they'd witnessed because I was in such good shape before.'

The 27-year-old started to feel ill last October but put his condition down to a cold. But within days he was admitted to hospital and slipped into a coma as his immune sytem began to attack his body

Doctors diagnosed Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a rare but serious condition which affects the body's nervous system. The maths teacher was forced to re-learn how to walk as a result of the illness

His wife Hayley (pictured) suspected her husband was exaggerating his symptoms. She said: 'It just sounded like man flu and I thought he would go to work and get over it. But then when things started to get worse three days later I had an instinctive feeling that something wasn't right'

Mr O'Neill began to feel unwell in October 2013 but, as an active dad who lifted weights and played football and squash regularly, he thought one day in bed would be enough to recover.

But when he had failed to recover a few days later, he decided to take a day off to get back to strength.

Far from getting better, he deteriorated dramatically and within a week of his first sick day he was no longer able to move and was admitted to hospital.

Guillain-Barre syndrome (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements.

It affects about 1,500 people in the UK every year and is slightly more common in men than women.

It causes the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed.

The exact cause of GBS is unknown, but most people - around 60 per cent of sufferers - develop the condition shortly after having a viral or bacterial infection.

The symptoms of GBS usually develop between one and three weeks after a minor infection. 

They often start in your hands and feet before spreading to your arms and legs. Initially a person suffering the condition may experience:- pain, tingling and numbness- progressive muscle weakness- co-ordination problems and unsteadiness

Weakness is likely to affect both sides of the body and gets worse over several days.

Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage.

In order to let his body recover, doctors sedated him and he remained in a coma while his terrified wife waited anxiously for a diagnosis.

Once doctors had ruled out all other possibilities they started pioneering treatment for GBS.

They discovered the condition had developed from the pneumonia in one lung, the illness Mr O'Neill had labelled 'man flu'.

Just under two months later, he had to start the long road to recovery in rehab by re-learning to walk.

Fortunately, he was one of the lucky sufferers who make a full recovery and since leaving hospital on Valentine's Day - more than three months on from being admitted - he has gone from strength to strength.

He is back playing squash, taking his daughter to the park, and will be back teaching later this month.

Mr O'Neill added: 'I missed my first Christmas with my daughter but had my first day release from hospital for my daughter's first birthday.

'Wanting to get back to my wife and daughter, and all the kids at school, was such a big motivator to work on the physio in rehab. I just wanted to be back to normal and forget the nightmare.

'My head teacher came to visit me and told me all the kids had been asking after me so I went back to see my classes for a day visit when I came out of hospital.

'I can't believe I'm going back to work soon - it's such a relief.'

Mrs O'Neill, said: 'When Tom said he had a cold I thought it was nothing serious - it just sounded like man flu and I thought he would go to work and get over it.

'But then when things started to get worse three days later I had an instinctive feeling that something wasn't right.

'When he started to lose feeling in his legs it was so scary and frightening.

'I'll never dismiss man flu again. Any little thing has me thinking it must be really serious.

The 27-year-old has battled back to regain his fitness and is preparing to return to his job as a teacher later this month. His wife Hayley, said: 'I'll never dismiss man flu again.'

'If he says he's got a headache I get really worried and quiz him: "Are you ok? Do you need to get checked out? Is there something seriously wrong?"

'Now he can't stop me fussing.'

Consultant neurologist Dr John Winer, an expert on GBS who works with the charity Gain, said: 'GBS is caused by your immune system attacking the nervous system instead of just fighting an infection.

'We think the damage is due to antibodies reacting with the precipitating infection which causes peripheral nerve damage.

'In 75 per cent per cent of cases there is a history of infection and that can be caused by either bacteria or a virus.

'We can normally identify which infection GBS developed from in half of all cases.

'But we don't understand it completely and we're not entirely sure what has caused the GBS in all cases.

'There are hundreds and hundreds of infections which are incriminated as triggers although some are more likely than others.'
