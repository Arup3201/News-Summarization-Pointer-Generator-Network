The young widow of a man found shot dead in his car is now pleading for the public's help in capturing her husband's killer.

David DeRoncey, 28, was on his way home from work Sunday night when he was shot dead and left in his car at the side of an Alabama highway.

His wife Ashley suspected something was wrong when she got a call from him at the gas station saying that he was having a problem with two of the other customers.

Calling for help: Ashley DeRoncey, 24, made a public appeal for witnesses to come forward in helping determine who shot her husband at the side of an Alabama highway on Sunday night

Newlyweds: Ashley and David had dated for seven years before getting married this July

When he still hadn't arrived home later that evening, she went out searching for him and found his bloodied body slumped over the steering wheel of his car that was up against the retaining wall of the highway near Birmingham.

'I just retracked his steps toward work and on his way back,' 24-year-old Ashley said as she held back tears at a press conference Tuesday.

'On the way back I was on the phone with my mother and I told her I'd seen his vehicle and she said "no just stay in the car" and I said "I'm not waiting, I'm not waiting," and went and checked out his vehicle.'

Though he was covered in blood, she held out hope tha he was still alive.

'I thought he still had a pulse. I held his head, and I told him it was going to be OK, and that I loved him and that help was on the way,' she said.

Once paramedics arrived on the scene, he was pronounced dead.

Heartbroken: Ashley last heard from David when he was on the way home from work and he said that he was having a 'problem' with two fellow customers at the gas station but did not elaborate

Vehicle: When he didn't arrive home shortly after the call, Ashley got nervous and retraced his steps, during which she found his abandoned Chevy Blazer (seen here)

Police are now retracing the timeline of events in hopes that they can find witnesses to what they believe was a car-to-car shooting.

Local news site AL.com reports that Mr DeRoncey finished his shift as the manager of Game Stop but stayed later to complete his tasks.

Timeline: Police believe David, 28, was shot in a car-to-car incident around 7pm on Saturday

He then kept up his daily routine of stopping at the Shell gas station on Oxmoor Road on his way home where he called his wife.

He said that he was having problems with two people at the store, and at one point he put her on hold to deal with the issue. When he restarted the conversation, he said that everything was fine and did not elaborate further.

After he did not immediately arrive home, Ashley became concerned and tried calling him repeatedly. She even reached out to their friends, posting on Facebook for anyone to contact her if she had heard from him in the past four hours.

She left the house to go look for him at around 7.30pm, though it seems she did not discover the abandoned blue Chevy Blazer with his dead body inside until later.

'We're very surprised that no one called in, that the vehicle sat there for four hours before his wife found him,' homicide Sgt. Scott Thurmond said at the press conference.

'It was a holiday weekend, travelers were returning back to home and even in just normal interstate traffic that was a busy area.'

The couple dated for seven years before getting married this July, and the reality of the situation does not appear to have sunk in.

‘Blood all over me, holding his head telling him to hold on im here helps on the way. Never in my life. Finding your husband your best friend like that is so,..........i miss you,’ she wrote on Facebook the morning after he was discovered.

'Best friend: Ashley is now planning her husband's funeral, just four months after their wedding (right)

Ashley was flanked by her relatives during the emotional press conference, and she has been organizing his funeral arrangements so that it fits with his personality. She has encouraged friends to host car shows in his memory and blast their sound systems when they drive to the burial via police escort.

‘I’m calling all bassheads! Any basshead can be there for the police escort to the graveyard. Possibly saturday. I want to all bassheads to blast their systems. Lets disturb the peace!!!!!’ she wrote.
