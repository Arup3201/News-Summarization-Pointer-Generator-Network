The college junior who allegedly overdosed on heroin with rock legend Jon Bon Jovi’s only daughter is from the same small, respectable, middle-class New Jersey town as the Bongiovi family. But the 21-year-old's Facebook page portrays a student who appears to be more into partying than academia.

Ian Grant, who is listed on his social networking page as a geology major at the elite Hamilton College in upstate New York, was facing drug charges for possession of heroin and marijuana, as was 19-year-old Stephanie Bongiovi.

But it was also revealed on Thursday that the criminal charges against both Bongiovi and Grant have been dropped by the Oneida County District Attorney’s Office.

TMZ
reported that neither Bongiovi nor 
Grant will face drug charges, citing a New York State Law that forbids prosecuting a person or 
people who are experiencing a drug overdose.

The two had promised to appear in court following the charges of heroin and marijuana possession.The D.A.’s office did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s calls for comment.

While the relationship between Bongiovi and Grant is unclear, the latter’s Facebook page shows several pictures of him with SOLO cups in hand.

Another shows him in Dublin, apparently on St Patrick’s Day, making an obscene gesture at the camera.

In other photos, the student is pictured with two pretty women, beer in hand.

Both Grant and and Bongiovi are from Red Bank, New Jersey. Grant was not at home on Thursday morning, MailOnline confirmed.

The quiet New Jersey streets seem at odds with the Jon Bon Jovi’s lavish lifestyle in Manhattan, where he owns in a $23million apartment in the borough’s exclusive SoHo neighborhood.

Still, in recent years, the aging rock star has overhauled his 1980s sex symbol image into a responsible father-of-four who also lives in suburban Red Bank.

Bongiovi and Grant allegedly overdosed in her third-floor dorm room in Dunham Hall, one of the largest on Hamilton’s campus

The first-year residence hall is described on the school's website as a dorm for freshman co-eds who 'thrive in a social environment.' It houses some 250 students and is located on the campus' north side.

The OD apparently happened on the third floor of Dunham Hall, according to various Twitter accounts.

One Twitter user wrote: 'Yeaaaaah go Hamilton! go heroin!! go Dunham 3rd floor!'  Others described the hall as 'Dirty Dunham,' adding that it is a 'grim' place.

Politico's Kate Nocera, who attended the college for her freshman and sophomore years, also chimed in on the shocking development: 'Who does heroin in Dunham of all places?'

According to the school's website, the first floor houses an equal number of rooms for both genders, while the second and third floors are still co-ed, but separated by even-odd numbered rooms.

Fifty percent of incoming Hamilton students live in Dunham Hall.

Bongiovi graduated last year from Poly Prep Country Day School, an elite K-12 school located in the Dyker Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.

Her brother is currently a lacrosse star at the $35,000-a-year academy.

The school, which was founded in 1854, has is famous for the number of its alumni who go onto Ivy League schools.

Bon Jovi was pictured just hours before his daughter allegedly overdosed on heroin at her $55,000-a-year liberal arts called a 'Little Ivy' for its rigorous academics and high entrance standards.

Bon Jovi was at a groundbreaking ceremony for the JBJ Soul Homes, a low-income housing project in Philadelphia that bears his name. 

The
ceremony drew 200 people, including Mayor Michael Nutter and leaders of
the Greater Exodus Baptist Church, according to the Philadelphia 
Inquirer.

Just hours later, Stephanie was rushed to the hospital from her dorm room.

MailOnline contacted representatives for the Bon Jovi frontman – who had no comment on the matter for the time being.

Hamilton
College has released a statement, saying it is co-operating with the 
police investigation - but would not say what action it will be taking 
against Stephanie.

It says 
say the 'alleged actions' not only violate state law, but also 
contravene college policy - stressing the primary concern is with 'the 
safety of our students'.

The statement, obtained by WKTV, reads: 'The college is cooperating with the police investigation.

'Our
first concern is always for the safety of our students. Out of respect 
for the privacy of our students and in accordance with federal 
regulations we do not discuss individual health or disciplinary 
matters.'

Bongiovi is Jon's
only daughter and the oldest of his four children. The singer has been 
married to his wife Dorothea Hurley – his childhood sweetheart – for 23
years and is regarded as having one of the strongest marriages in 
Hollywood.

He has admitted to dabbling in drugs himself in the past, but says he 'wised up quickly'.

In
a 2007 interview with Best Life magazine, he confessed: 'I did the drug
thing very young and wised up very young too, because I was into drugs a
little too much.

'I've never been a drug guy. I've always felt I didn't have the mental stability to handle drugs.'

Bon Jovi is scheduled to perform at a benefit concert for Hamilton in Times Square on December 5.
