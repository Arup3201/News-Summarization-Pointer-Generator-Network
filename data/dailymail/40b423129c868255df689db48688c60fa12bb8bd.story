Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke has dismissed reports linking him with a move away from the club, insisting he 'sees life in red and white'.

The news will come as a blow to the likes of Manchester United and Manchester City, who are both admirers of the Spain international. 

The 23-year-old played a key role in the heart of Diego Simeone's side as Atletico broke the Real Madrid-Barcelona duopoly last season to claim a surprise La Liga title.

Koke, an Atletico academy graduate, was also instrumental as the club reached the final of the Champions League before losing to local rivals Real Madrid.

The midfielder embodies the team ethic that has brought coach Simeone so much success during his spell with Atleti and supporters will be delighted that he has pledged his future to the club. 

He told AS: 'I see life in red and white. I am happy here, the club is growing and I grow with it. I don't see the time or the place to leave here.'
