A British holidaymaker has died after allegedly being hit with a rock during a fight at a hotel swimming pool.

The Civil Guard police force arrested the other couple following the fight at the three-star Blue Sea Los Fiscos hotel.

A receptionist there said: 'I cannot give out any information at all. We have been told to say nothing about it.'

Mr Atkinson was taken unconscious by ambulance to the Doctor Jose Molina Orosa hospital in Arrecife but doctors were not able to save his life.

An autopsy was due to be carried out today to establish the cause of death.

The Civil Guard were not immediately available for comment.

The Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Lanzarote. We have informed next of kin and are offering consular assistance.

'We are also aware of the arrests of two British nationals and we are providing them with consular assistance.'
