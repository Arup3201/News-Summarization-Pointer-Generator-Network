A new study has revealed married men would much prefer to watch the FIFA World Cup final than have sex

Nearly three out of four married men would rather watch players getting hot and sweaty on the field at the FIFA World Cup final than get down and dirty with their significant others.

A study released by dating website Ashley Madison surveyed more than 15,000 of their members and revealed that 72% of the married men would prefer sport to sex if the big game was on.

Noel Biderman, CEO and Founder of AshleyMadison.com revealed the reason for the 'sport-related sexual drought'.

'These men are die-hard soccer fans who, for the past month, have devoted all of their spare time and emotional energy to supporting their favourite team.Â 

'Believe it or not, the passion and excitement men feel for the game is often on par with that for their partner, however, in this case watching the game has taken priority over fulfilling sexual needs in their relationship,' he said in the study.

But this comes at a price, as International Spokesperson for the website, Christoph Kraemer, told Daily Mail Australia that female sign-ups to the site soar during serious sporting competitions such as the World Cup.

'While the men are watching the game and neglecting their wives and girlfriends they take it as the perfect opportunity to sign up,' he said.

The findings were released by dating site Ashley Madison who surveyed more than 15,000 of their members

In the study women ranked the most 'cheat-worthy' players, putting Gerard Pique (left) in the top spot with Christiano Ronald (right) also making the top five

Mr Kraemer also said that numbers of new female members to their dating website - which boasts the tagline 'Life is short. Have an affair' - in France and Germany climaxed at between 600 and 900 percent while their men were watching others play the field.

'Whenever there are major sport events, especially when they seem to be more male oriented, female sign-ups go up,' he revealed.

Women, if they're not jumping onto dating websites while the football is on, are perving on the players while their partners are engrossed in the play.

The site asked female members to rank the exceptional eye-candy, and the favourite was Spanish defender Gerard Pique, followed closely by Glen Johnson from England.

More than half of Brazilian and Dutch male married members of the dating site said they would be keen to get intimate during the final as long as they could watch the game at the same time

Germany's Mats Hummels, Argentinian forward Ezequiel Lavezzi and Portuguese heartthrob Cristiano Ronaldo all made the top five.

Despite the Socceroos being knocked out after just three games in the World Cup, increased numbers of Australian women were also said to be straying while the soccer was on.

In a similar vein to the married males, just eight per cent of single men admitted they would be willing to miss the big game for some intimate time with a lover.

Meantime, sport is on the brain for a third of Germans and Argentineans, who admitted to thinking about soccer while between the sheets with their female 'wives or affair partners'.

Taking it a step further, more than half of Brazilian and Dutch members are open to a bit of multi-tasking, keen to watch the game and score a goal of their own at the same time.

And married men apparently have excuses to get out of sex while the final is on at the ready, with more than half of them worried they might miss a goal if they instead spend time with their missus.
