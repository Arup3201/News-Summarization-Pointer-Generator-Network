'Driven by jealousy and hurt pride': Harpreet Singh, 25, sent nearly 400 'threatening' text messages to Elaine Tilbury, 20, after she dumped him

A Met special constable bombarded his ex-girlfriend with hundreds of texts branding her a slut when she broke up with him.

Harpreet Singh, 25, sent nearly 400 'threatening and distressing' text messages to Elaine Tilbury, 20, after she dumped him because he was controlling and needy, a court heard.

Miss Tilbury was left 'scared and intimidated' and was too frightened to leave the house during his campaign of harassment.

Singh, who was a civilian worker with the Central Communications Command at the Met and also served as a special constable in Wandsworth, was yesterday found guilty of one count of harassment.

The pair had begun their relationship when Singh was working as a security officer in Debenhams.

The fling continued after he began working with the Metropolitan Police, but Miss Tilbury eventually broke it off last year.

'Driven by jealousy and hurt pride,' Singh began bombarding the young woman with 'unpleasant' texts, including threats such as saying things will 'end up nasty' between them.

A judge dismissed Singh's claims in court that he thought their relationship was still alive and that she was 'happy to' get the messages from him.

Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Singh remained impassive and stared at the ground as the verdict was given at Wimbledon Magistrates Court yesterday.

District Judge Barbara Barnes said: 'This case concerns two people in a volatile relationship that turned sour.

'Elaine Tilbury was credible and compelling in what she explained. She was a young woman trying to extract herself from a relationship.

'There was communication between her and you and that several texts from you that I find to be unpleasant in nature.

'The content of these messages was threatening and distressing.

'I considered your evidence. You 
expressed your view that you thought the relationship was still going on
 so Ms Tilbury happy to receive text messages from you.

'You said you were trying to salvage the relationship. I find your evidence was not compelling.

'You
 were not prepared to accept the relationship was over and as a result 
resorted to sending numerous messages driven by jealousy and hurt pride.

'Your whole behaviour here does amount to harassment. Ms Tilbury didn't want to receive this volume of contact from you.

'You knew or ought to have known this was harassment.

'Sending such messages saying things will 'end up nasty' is threatening and abusive and the sheer volume of the texts is such that you ought to have known it amounted to harassment.

'Ms Tilbury was scared. She was scared, intimidated and reluctant to leave the house ... you are guilty of the offence.'

Singh, of Ilford, Essex, was released on conditional bail and will be sentenced at the same court on May 16.
