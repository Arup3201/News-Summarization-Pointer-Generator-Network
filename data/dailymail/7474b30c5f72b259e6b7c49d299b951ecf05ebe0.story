A group of Nottingham Trent University alumni and friends helped one man ask the most important question of his life.

Nicholas Hugh Laughton, 29, decided to pop the question to girlfriend Cherie Leanne Amner, 27, in a less than conventional way.

Rather than a candle-lit dinner and getting down on one knee, Nick spend over 10 months planning and filming a video to ask for Cherie’s hand in marriage, involving all their family and friends, and featuring all the special places in their relationship.

The video, which took months to make, begins with Nick sending out a text to family and friends

Nick told his girlfriend of seven years that they were going back to their old student union for a friend's party, but that he would be late and join her there.

As Cherie waited at the party with some of her friends, the proposal video began to play on the screen.

From he and his university friends riding a tank, to the Nottingham Trent University cheerleaders doing a routine, Nick fills the video with in-jokes and memories shared by the couple.

Speaking to MailOnline, Nick said of his ambitious project: ‘Ultimately the idea came from the notion that I wanted a proposal that turned immediately into the engagement party.

The couple, seen here graduating together from Nottingham Trent University, have been together for over seven years

‘The proposal itself was designed to take Cherie back to the origins of our relationship - which was our time at NTU and the video was a way of making our closest friends and immediate family a part of it.

‘Once I'd made the realisation that a video was going to be the platform for the proposal I approached a friend who owns his own media production company Janno Productions.

'It was at that point that the project really stepped up a notch because Wallace was able to take all of my crazed ideas and turn it into a realistically achievable and exceptionally professional production.’

The film starts with Cherie’s friends and family around the world – from Sydney to Dubai to London - receiving a text from Nick telling them that ‘Project Vegas’ will happen that evening.

We see 
each person rushing to the venue, including Nick’s ‘Trent Army’ 
university friends piling into a military tank to make their way to 
Nottingham.

Each clip of film is filled with little memories shared between the couple and their family and friends.

flowers in hand, accompanied by her loved ones.

‘It
 was crucial to me that the level of detail in the video meant Cherie 
could watch it again and again discovering new bits of hidden meaning 
the more she watched it.

For the couple, who met at Nottingham Trent, their university has a special significance for them - so their friends dusted off their university cheer-leading outfits for the video

Roping in musician friends, the video is accompanied trumpets at some points

'As a result, every single person featured in the video is a friend or family member of Cherie's and virtually every single prop in shot at any one time has a story behind it which holds hidden meaning to Cherie.

'There are points in the video where you have to pause it just to see the detail but that adds a whole other layer of enjoyment to it for Cherie and there are still certain things she's yet to discover.

‘The web of lies and misdirection I had to concoct to keep Cherie in the dark was something of a marvel. Over the course of the production I was living a double life and even made fake train tickets to cover my tracks.

‘Above and beyond everything though our friends and family were amazing at misleading Cherie; there were numerous staged conversations designed purely to plant fictitious notions in Cherie's head, and for a period of 10 months there was around 80 people in a Cherie's life who could at any moment have spilled the beans!’

However, Nick’s complex scheme worked, as, when the video began to play at what Cherie believed was a friend’s birthday party she was absolutely caught off guard.

The video eventually sees friends hold up letters spelling out 'You had better say yes!!'

‘I wasn't suspicious in the slightest, we both work long hours so I never questioned it - even in the final lead up I thought I was in Nottingham for a friend's birthday and was never given any reason to question it.

‘At the beginning I thought I was watching a video for our friend Wallace who's birthday party it supposedly was - when the alarm went off I thought the sound system had broken - it wasn't until one of my best friends from Australia appeared on the screen that I realised it was too personal to me to be for anyone else. I suddenly thought to myself "oh my goodness is this it, is Nick proposing?"

‘I think what I was most overwhelmed at was the efforts everyone had gone to, to create something so truly amazing - I haven't stopped smiling from that moment, my cheeks even now ache. ‘

The couple, who live together in Greenwich, London , met when they were both students at Nottingham University.

When Nick arrives at the union he pulls Cherie on stage and gets down on one knee. After the video, unsurprisingly, she says yes

Cherie says: ‘Nick and I became good friends but there was one night in particular in the old NTSU where Nick was a bit worse for wear, had wandered off to the bathroom and against my better judgement I confided my concern in a mutual friend saying "Don't tell him but I think I like Nick?!"

‘As soon as Nick reappeared our friend immediately called out "Nick - Cherie fancies you!" to which Nick somewhat vacantly responded "brilliant" - and that was essentially the beginning of our relationship!'

The pair plan to marry in 2016, but Cherie says the proposal is something she will remember forever

‘The efforts of Nick, Wallace, and all my friends and family put into helping create the most magical moment of my life is something I will never forget and I feel very blessed to have such incredible friends and family and of course my amazing fiancé - I am so excited for the next chapter of our future together!’
