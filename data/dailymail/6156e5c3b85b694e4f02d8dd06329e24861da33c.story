Eight-time grand slam champion Andre Agassi believes American men's tennis has to 'regroup at grass roots level' if it ever wants to boast a world number one again.

The United States take on Great Britain in the Davis Cup in Glasgow this weekend, hoping to avenge last year's 3-1 defeat in San Diego.

World number five Andy Murray will lead the charge for Britain and goes into the first-round World Group tie as the stand-out singles player, with America's John Isner and Donald Young ranked only 20th and 47th respectively.

It is a far cry from the days of Agassi, who lifted the Davis Cup in 1990, 1992 and 1995 alongside the likes of seven-time Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras and four-time major winner Jim Courier.

The last time America produced a male grand slam winner was 2003, when Agassi won the Australian Open and Andy Roddick triumphed in Flushing Meadows.

'Being the next Andy Roddick or the next Andre Agassi will still leave you shy of winning tournaments these days. That's the truth,' Agassi told Press Association Sport.

'Will we ever have a number one player again? That's achievable, of course it is, but the four guys at the top now - Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray - they have redefined what this sport is all about over the last 10 years.

'You need something unique these days to make inroads, especially growing up in a country that doesn't have red clay courts.

'I don't know where Andy spent his childhood playing (he spent time in Spain as a teenager) but he plays the game like he wasn't just playing indoors.

'We don't have that in America. We have a lot of fast court players and the ones who do shine are the ones who bring a different equation.

'Isner, for example, is a monster, he's 6ft 10 plus with a huge game, so we have to regroup at a grass roots level.'

Despite a shock defeat to 18-year-old Borna Coric in Dubai last week, Murray will be expected to win both his singles matches in Glasgow.

That means the tie could depend on the doubles rubber, where Andy and Jamie Murray are set to face American twins Bob and Mike Bryan, the most successful duo of all time.

'It's a tough ask for both teams because there's very little that separates it,' Agassi said.

'We have a big advantage in our doubles but you guys have a huge advantage with Murray.

'People think he's coming off a bad loss but I've got news for you; he's going to be ready to go in a week and he's going to be playing his best tennis in front of a home crowd.  

'I hope we can get over the finishing line and I'll have my fingers crossed like the rest of us.'

Agassi has previously admitted an interest in a coaching career and is even considered a potential mentor for Murray, who idolised the American as a junior.

'I enjoy the idea of coaching but I wouldn't physically, emotionally and mentally be able to do the job that I would want to do,' Agassi said.

'You can't just step in and give advice. Coaching isn't talking, it's learning.

'The things I say about Andy are not going to be a surprise to him.

'It's finding out what that switch is, it's getting them to see something a different way and you can't do that until you spend time and learn with them.

'I can't commit the time now, even if I wanted to, I have too many responsibilities.

'That doesn't mean there wouldn't be a time in the future, but I can't do it at the moment.'
