An American mom who believes her daughter was murdered by convicted killer Joran Van der Sloot has said she was sickened by his wedding to a Peruvian woman in a prison ceremony in July.

Beth Holloway's 18-year-old daughter Natalee disappeared in Aruba in 2005 and Dutchman Van der Sloot remains the chief suspect in her death.

He is currently serving a 28-year sentence in Peru for killing business student Stephany Flores on May 30, 2010 - the fifth anniversary of Natalee's disappearance.

Van der Sloot has never been charged with Natalee's murder, but is due to be extradited to the U.S. in 2038 on charges of attempting to extort money from her mom Beth.

In July, Van der Sloot married 25-year-old Peruvian trainee accountant Leidy Figueroa and she gave birth to his daughter, Dushy, three month later.

'When I hear it... It makes you sick,' Beth told Oprah Winfrey on Oprah: Where Are They Now?

'But I really try to focus on what I truly care about. And what I truly care about is information as to what happened to Natalee.'

Oprah, who first interviewed Beth in 2008, told her it felt 'like a knife to me' when she heard that Van der Sloot had confessed to killing Flores in 2010.

'It felt like a knife to me, and I have no relationship with you other than interview,' said Oprah.

'When I hear it... It makes you sick,' Beth spoke with Oprah Winfrey for her Where Are They Now? show. The pair had originally spoken about Natalee's 2005 disappearance six years ago 

Prior to killing Flores, Van der Sloot had been attempting to extort money from Beth claiming he could sell her her daughter's remains.

'At that time that that was all happening, Joran had reached out [to me],' Beth said. 'He was trying to extort money out of me, trying to sell me Natalee's remains, which... just shocks the conscious.'

Van der Sloot had allegedly offered to reveal the location of the teen's remains in exchange for $250,000.

Beth said the FBI was ready to step in and arrest Van der Sloot when he fled the country and went to Peru.

She even made an unauthorized visit to Peru and confronted him in custody. 

'I went there to reach out to the Flores family and to support them. I didn't go there with this plan [that] I'm going to see Joran,' she explained. 

'I did [confront him]. I just wanted to get to Joran. I honestly don't know if I was going there to get information from him... For some reason, I needed some sense of how to begin to... find my way through this journey.'

'Did you expect that he would tell you something?' asked Oprah.

'No,' answered Beth. 'Maybe somewhere deep down...'

In September Van der Sloot's wife told MailOnline that her husband was 'gentle, sensitive, kind' and 'no monster', despite being a convicted murderer.

'My Joran is no monster,' declared Figueroa, who insisted her husband has changed since they started an unlikely prison romance four years ago.

She said the 6ft 5in killer was a 'different man' after finding God and said he 'seeks forgiveness' for the evil he has committed.

And in a series of astonishing prison love letters seen by MailOnline, Van der Sloot's passionate feelings for his 5ft 3in wife were laid bare.

Ms Figueroa also said that her husband is close to breaking point after becoming deeply depressed by his new living conditions which he described as 'worse than Guantanamo Bay'.

The prison's conditions are in stark contrast to those under which Van der Sloot fell in love with Leidy in an unlikely prison romance four years ago. 

Lax prison rules meant he was able to play online poker, use a cellphone, take drugs and have other women come and go as he pleased.

And he enjoyed teaching English to other inmates and doing arts and crafts, making ceramic sculptures for his wife.

Van der Sloot was transferred to Challapalca in August after he threatened to kill the warden of the Piedras Gordas penitentiary in Lima.

He was found with an illegal cellphone which was confiscated, officials of the Inpe prisons administration said.

Van der Sloot even recorded a video in which he showed the conditions in his cell, later saying that it was warden Sergio Haro who provided him with the cellphone.

'The warden himself gave it to me. I don't know why, but I suspect that it was to set a trap for me,' said Van der Sloot in a portion of the video.

According to Leidy, Warden Haro was furious and told her husband he had never liked him. Van der Sloot was immediately thrown in the 'Hole' – solitary confinement – for six days.

Leidy said: 'When he came out of the Hole the warden told Joran that he won't see his baby daughter when she's born. Joran didn't believe him but the warden is true to his word.'

However she is confident that one day she and Van der Sloot will be together properly. 'Somehow one day he's going to leave prison and we can be a family,' she said.

Van der Sloot is expected to remain in prison until 2038 and then be extradited to the United States to face charges of extortion and fraud for allegedly falsely promising to lead Natalee Holloway's mother to the girl's body in exchange for $250,000 payment.

The murderer was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba.

No charges were filed against Van der Sloot and the case remains unsolved.
