Roy Hodgson will turn to England’s kids by naming Fabian Delph, Calum Chambers, Danny Rose and John Stones in his first squad since the calamitous World Cup campaign in Brazil.

England’s head coach is preparing for next week’s friendly at Wembley against Norway on Wednesday before the national team travel to Basle for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland.

Hodgson is also considering a first call-up for Southampton right-back Nathaniel Clyne, but this may depend on the severity of an injury to Liverpool full-back Glen Johnson.

Jack Colback, who moved to Newcastle from Sunderland this summer, is also on Hodgson’s radar, but may be sidelined by injury.

Hodgson will name Wayne Rooney as England captain after the retirement of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard.

The eye-catching name is Chambers, who deserves to leapfrog Gareth Southgate’s Under 21s after his exceptional start to the season with Arsenal.

Aston Villa midfielder Delph features for the first time in Hodgson’s squad, which will be named at around noon on Thursday. He gained a reputation as a no-nonsense midfielder when he kicked former Leeds boss Dennis Wise in the air in his first training session at the Yorkshire club, before moving to Villa in 2009. He has since established himself as a pivotal part of Paul Lambert’s side.

Tottenham left-back Rose and Everton defender Stones will also be called up to the squad.

England’s young guns could face Norway’s 15-year-old midfielder Martin Odegaard on Wednesday, after he played all 90 minutes of their 0-0 draw with UAE to become their youngest ever player.
