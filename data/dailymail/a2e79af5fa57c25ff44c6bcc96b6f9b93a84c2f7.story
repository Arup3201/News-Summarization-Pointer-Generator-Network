For those on death row, it is the last thing they have left to look forward to.

But inmates in Texas will no longer be allowed to choose their final meal, after a convicted murderer ordered a massive multi-course dinner.

Lawrence Brewer, who was executed on Wednesday, asked for two chicken steaks, a triple bacon cheeseburger, fried okra, three fajitas, a pizza, a pint of ice cream, and a slab of peanut butter fudge with crushed peanuts. He reportedly refused to eat any of the feast once it was delivered.

Houston State Senator John Whitmire 
wrote to the executive director of the Texas Criminal Justice Division 
saying that he had long opposed the practice, and that 'enough is 
enough.'

He said the last meal request is an 
'extremely inappropriate' privilege, 'one which the perpetrator did not 
provide to their victim.'

Houstonpress.com reports that executive director Brad Livingston agreed with Sen. Whitmire.

He said: 'I believe Senator Whitmire's concerns regarding the practice of allowing death row offenders to choose their last meal are valid.

'Effective immediately, no such accommodations will be made. They will receive the same meal served to other offenders on the unit.'

Lawrence Brewer, 44, was put to death by lethal injection for his part in the 1998 killing of James Byrd in Jasper, East Texas.

Brewer was one of three men convicted of killing Mr Byrd after they offered him a lift along a remote country road.

Mr Byrd, 49, was beaten unconscious and 
urinated upon before being bound to the vehicle by his ankles with a 
heavy logging chain and driven for three miles.

Forensic evidence showed that he was 
alive for much of the ordeal but was killed when the vehicle hit a 
concrete drainage channel causing his head and arm to be ripped from his
 body.

John William King, 36, was also 
convicted of capital murder and sent to death row. His case remains 
under appeal. The third man, Shawn Berry, 36, received a life prison 
term.

Victim: James Byrd Jr died after being chained to the bumper of a pick-up truck by Brewer and two other white supremacists

After dumping his remains in an African-American cemetery his killers drove off to a barbeque.

In an interview from death row, Brewer
 told KFDM that he participated in the assault on Mr Byrd but had 'nothing 
to do with the killing as far as dragging him or driving the truck or 
anything’.

He told the station his execution would be a 'good out' and he's 'glad it's about to come to an end’.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice said Brewer's family was allowed to see him one last time yesterday morning.

He was then taken from the Polunsky Unit in Livingston to an isolation cell in Huntsville where the sentence was carried out.

Mr Byrd's death led to the ‘Federal 
October 22, 2009 Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes 
Prevention Act’, commonly known as the 'Matthew Shepard Act'.

President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on October 28, 2009.

The brutal death put Jasper, a typical
 East Texas town with a Dairy Queen, Walmart and a handful of fast-food 
places some 60 miles from the nearest interstate highway, under a 
national spotlight.

'Everywhere you went, anywhere in the 
country, once people found out you were from Jasper, Texas, they wanted 
to ask you about it,' said Mike Lout, mayor and the town radio station 
owner.

'Everybody first was shocked and 
appalled and not proud of it. They talked about it so much in the days 
past it, I think most people wanted to put it out of their minds.'

'It's heartbreaking,' said Billy Rowles, who was sheriff at the time of Mr Byrd's murder.

'A lot of effort and hard work and 
soul-searching went into trying to live down the stereotype. It's so 
easy to get back into that mode.'

His huge last meal had echoes of that 
enjoyed by Robert Harris in 1992, who killed two teenage boys. He had a 
chicken bucket, two large pizzas, a Pepsi six-pack, jelly beans and 
Camel cigarettes.

The subject of last meals before execution has thrown 
up some interesting results over the last few decades, with James Smith 
being refused a request of dirt in 1990 and instead eating yoghurt.

The horrific killing of James Byrd Jr is seen as one of America's worst racial crimes since the civil rights era.

The brutal nature of his death shocked the U.S. and was condemned by the then President Bill Clinton.

As
 the defendants had served time in prison, their arrests focused 
national attention on the prevalence of the white supremacist prison 
gangs to which they belonged.

Brewer's father claimed his son had joined the gang after being brutalised and abused by black inmates while incarcerated.

During
 the trial Brewer claimed that although he had been present on the 
night, he had not taken part in the killing and blamed the other two - 
John King and Shawn Berry, both 24 at the time. He told the jury he 'had no intention of killing nobody'.

In
 court he claimed King had started a fight with Mr Byrd, and that Mr 
Berry had slashed the victim across the throat before chaining him to 
the bumper of the pick-up truck.

Prosecutors
 said they believed Mr Byrd had been killed to promote Brewer and 
Berry's white supremacist organisation the Confederate Knights of 
America  and to initiate Berry into the group.

Brewer admitted joining the group while serving time in a Texan prison with King.

Basketball star Dennis Rodman made a 
$25,000 donation to a fund started to support Byrd's family. He had 
previously offered to pay for the funeral.

The
 Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act passed 
in 2009 expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to 
include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, 
sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.
