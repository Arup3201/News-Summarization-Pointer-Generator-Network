Team news

Stoke   

Stoke will be without suspended duo Peter Crouch and Phil Bardsley for Saturday's visit of in-form West Ham.

Striker Crouch was sent off for the first time in Stoke colours in Wednesday's Capital One Cup loss to Southampton and full-back Bardsley picked up his fifth yellow card of the season in the same game.

Marc Muniesa is a doubt after going over on his ankle in training while fellow defender Robert Huth (calf), midfielder Glenn Whelan (broken leg) and striker Peter Odemwingie (knee) are all sidelined.

Provisional squad: Begovic, Sorensen, Wilson, Shawcross, Pieters, Cameron, Muniesa, Nzonzi, Adam, Sidwell, Ireland, Walters, Arnautovic, Bojan, Assaidi, Moses, Diouf.

West Ham 

Diafra Sakho will be assessed as late as Saturday morning as Sam Allardyce gives the West Ham striker as much time as possible to prove his fitness for their game at Stoke.

The in-form forward injured a shoulder in the 2-1 win over Manchester City last week and it remains to be seen if he is risked at the Britannia Stadium despite scoring six goals in as many Barclays Premier League starts.

James Tomkins and Matt Jarvis return to the squad after both recovered from thigh injuries but Guy Demel remains sidelined with Mauro Zarate (thigh) a doubt and Andy Carroll not in contention despite returning to training following ankle surgery.

Provisional squad: Adrian, Jaaskelainen, Cresswell, O'Brien, Reid, Tomkins, Collins, Jenkinson, Noble, Kouyate, Song, Poyet, Nolan, Amalfitano, Downing, Jarvis, Vaz Te, Cole, Zarate, Sakho, Valencia.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Stoke have won eight of their last 12 Premier League home games (L3 D1).

West Ham have now scored in eight successive Premier League games; their best run in the competition since Nov 2009 (10 games).

Diafra Sakho became only the second player in Premier League history to score in his first six starts in the competition thanks to his goal versus Man City (after Mick Quinn). No-one has ever scored in their first seven.

Stoke City have allowed their opponents fewer shots on target than any other side in the Premier League (22).

West Ham are seven points better off compared to their equivalent matches against the same opposition from last season; the best such record in the Premier League.

Just six goals have been scored at the Britannia Stadium so far this season, fewer than any other Premier League ground.

Mark Arnautovic is yet to hit the target with any of his 11 shots in the Premier League this season (incl. blocked).

If he features, Carlton Cole will play his 200th Premier League game for West Ham. Only two players Steve Potts (204) and Mark Noble (201 currently) have featured more.

Only Paolo Di Canio (47) has scored more Premier League goals for West Ham than Cole (41).

The Hammers squad have had 35 headed shots in the Premier League so far this season, 17 more than any other team (Sunderland, Chelsea and QPR all on 18). They have scored seven headed goals; a league high.
