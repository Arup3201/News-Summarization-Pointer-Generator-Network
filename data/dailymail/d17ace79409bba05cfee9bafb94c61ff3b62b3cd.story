Manchester United midfielder Anderson is due to sign for Internacional on Monday.

Talks have been ongoing since last week with the Brazilian side, the player's representatives and United in discussions about cancelling the 26-year-old's contract.

Internacional want Anderson to play in the Copa Libertadores and are understood to have offered a four-year contract worth around £25,000 a week after tax with a £650,000 annual bonus.

Anderson is due in Porto Alegre with his agents on Monday for medical tests before being unveiled on Tuesday.

Anderson has been surplus to requirements under Louis Van Gaal and indeed under David Moyes, who loaned him out to Fiorentina.

The 26-year-old has rarely shown glimpses of his potential since moving from Porto with Nani in a deal worth £26million in 2007.
