She said Archer then reneged on a promise to pay for her legal bills

For the past 14 years she has refused to have anything to do with him.

But now the frostiness between Jeffrey Archer and his ex-mistress Sally Farmiloe may have finally begun to thaw after they met for the first time since the catastrophic end to their affair.

They were photographed side by side after bumping into each other at an awards ceremony last week.

Behind her smile, however, it is clear Miss Farmiloe, 64, who has terminal cancer, still harbours some resentment towards the disgraced peer, complaining that during their meeting he showed ‘no regret’ for her problems.

She is said to have been furious with him after he allegedly failed to support her when their affair was revealed.

The pair, who met through fundraising work for the Tory Party, began seeing each other in 1996 behind the back of Archer’s wife Mary, but in 1999 a newspaper exposed them.

Miss Farmiloe said Archer then reneged on a promise to pay for her legal bills when she sued the paper for libel in 2000.

The following year he was jailed for four years for perjury after lying to a court about his dealings with prostitute Monica Coghlan.

Archer was recently reported to have made derogatory comments about Miss Farmiloe as she lay critically ill in hospital.

She was diagnosed with secondary bone and liver cancer last year and wears a wig because of the intensive chemotherapy.

She has been gravely ill, and told in March how doctors had issued her with a ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ order without consulting her family.

It was that same month that friends told her Archer had made ‘callous’ remarks about her to a Times journalist. The journalist wrote that he had been ‘shocked’ by the comments, and Archer had asked for them not to be printed.

Miss Farmiloe said she was still ‘fuming’ about the article when she saw Archer last week. She added: ‘He said not one word of regret that I had suffered so much from cancer. All he wanted to talk about was his new book.’ Commenting on the article, she said: ‘[It was] presumably because he thought I was dying and would not see it. Wrong gal, pal! I intend to live with cancer, not die from it.’

Miss Farmiloe, whose  husband Jeremy, 60, is a surveyor, is now said to be feeling better and has defied her grave prognosis by appearing at a series of glamorous events.

Last Thursday she wore a glittering red gown and tiara for an event at a London hotel where Archer was handing out awards to City high achievers.

Friends said she knew he would be there and decided to front him up. One source said: ‘She didn’t confront him about what he said. He just wanted to talk about his book.

‘But she wanted to show him she’s still here, alive and fighting. She wanted him to know he hadn’t got away with it.

‘I’m surprised she didn’t hit him over the head with a plant pot. She has been so furious with him over the years.’

But Miss Farmiloe said: ‘I decided to forgive him because anger exacerbates cancer and we had some nice pictures taken together. Jeffrey was looking extremely well. I would say he is living the good life.'
