It was a strong look for a damp Wednesday morning. But as Pippa Middleton power-walked her way up the Kings Road this morning in top-to-toe black, she looked every inch the businesswoman on a mission.

Earlier this week the younger Middleton girl had stepped out in town wearing a rather more relaxed jeans and jumper combo. Clearly today she meant to make her mark.

The Duchess of Cambridge's sister, who paid a visit to upmarket West London restaurant Aubaine, dressed to impress in a long-line black Sefanel coat with that 90s nipped-at-the-waist, single-breasted style sister Kate seems to like so much too.

Power brunch: Pippa looked sharp for a morning visit to West London restaurant Aubaine

Lady in black: Pippa accessorised her all-black outfit with her monochrome Aspinal Marylebone tote and £151 Givenchy sunglasses

Underneath was a simple black Cleopatra cashmere bell-sleeved Shift dress by Cashmere by Tania, £470, which she matched to suede Russell & Bromley boots.

A touch of luxe was brought by her very covetable Aspinal handbag - the £795 Marylebone tote, which is, of course, sold out - apologies to avid (and wealthy) Pippa fashion followers.

A surprise bargain flourish came with Pippa's necklace, the £15 Andrea from Accessorize, sold out but being reintroduced in a slightly different take later this month.

It is not clear who Pippa was meeting today, but given the number of professional pies she has her finger in - newspaper columnist, magazine contributing editor, food writer, author, party planner - it could have been to talk about any one of a thousand ventures.

Yesterday it was revealed that the Pippa effect was still going strong, after a pair of £150 boots she wore twice in January sold out in just 12 hours, just as the Aspinal tote had done before it.

The suede boots, made by independent Somerset-based brand Seven Boot Lane, disappeared from shelves within a day of Pippa's appearance in them - and have now attracted a growing waiting list, with more expected in-store on the 24 January.

What a gem: Pippa wore the Andrea statement necklace, Accessorize, £15, which has now sold out - but a similar one will be in store later this month

Speaking to MailOnline Seven Boot 
Lanes founders Sebastian and Mais Edwards said: 'It's an absolute 
delight to have Pippa Middleton wearing Seven Boot Lane.

'Alice has always been a popular boot but the impact of Pippa wearing them has been extraordinary.

'The
 boot sold out online in about 12 hours - overnight basically - and 
nearly half the orders we have taken came from overseas, particularly 
the U.S.

'When someone with Pippa’s influence is wearing your product it opens up a whole new audience, all over the world. 

'Because
 she dresses in a way that is effortlessly stylish, people find her 
looks to be very accessible and therefore they trust the brands that she
 wears.

Bag lady: Pippa carried the £795 Marylebone tote, which also sold out after Pippa stepped out carrying it

Old favourite: Pippa's coat is by Sefanel and cost £295 when it was released last season. Pippa was previously spotted wearing the coat last November for an evening event

Lady who lunches: Pippa looked chic in navy and white as she spent the afternoon out and about in London earlier this week - carrying the same Aspinal tote

Sell out! Pippa's bag on the Aspinal website - but bad luck if you want to buy one as the version Pippa has - the Monochrome Saffiano - is out of stock
