Parents and teachers are rallying around a California high school wrestling coach put on leave after video emerged of him  using wrestling moves to try to subdue a male student.

Mark Black had been teaching his science class when it allegedly came to his attention that the unnamed student had drugs in his possession.

A confrontation ensued and video shows what happened thereafter, but what seems like a case of a teacher going too far has some of Black's colleagues cheering him on.

Shocking? A shocking physical altercation between student and teacher was caught on a cell phone camera Friday

In the few days since Black's story came to light, a Facebook page called 'We Support Coach Black of Samohi' has received close to 12,000 'likes.'

One supporter, who identified himself on Facebook as former Santa Monica-Malibu District administrator Steve Martinez, wrote that Black did the right thing.

'If you had a child in this class and another student was selling 
drug[s] in clear view, you would want any teacher to do what Mark Black 
did,' Martinez wrote. 'He did in fact try 
to resolve this situation peacefully by asking the student to turn over 
the drugs to him. The student resisted and became aggressive … Support 
this great teacher and wonderful person. He needs us at this time.'

A former student also wrote in to support Black, the Los Angeles Times reported. 

'You should all know that I lost my father when I was quite young,' the student wrote. 'Black 
has been like a second father to me, just as he has to hundreds of other
 kids throughout the years. He's kept kids off the streets, gotten 
others into college, and shaped the lives of so many others throughout 
his long service to this community. When you continue to hear about this
 story, and hear people try to defend the student or attack Coach Black,
 I beg of you to speak out against their false accusations.'

In a letter sent to parents Friday by Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, Superintendent Sandra Lyon initially argued that the well-regarded wrestling coach and teacher crossed a line.

'We really don't want teachers putting their hands on other students,' she wrote, calling the 'physical restraint' he used 'unacceptable.'

At the heart of the confrontation was the student's alleged marijuana possession.

'The little boy was selling drugs in class,' student Kylan Townsend told KTLA. 'The wrestling coach told him to stop...I guess he didn't listen and tables were thrown. They started fighting.'

There were no punches thrown, no kicking, and no yelling during the altercation.

However, Black was suspended even before an investigation was conducted.

Lyon said that an automatic suspension before investigation was standard school policy and in no way meant that the outcome was predetermined.

Lyon also later apologized for her initial remarks about Black, acknowledging to the that her statement showed 'pre-judgement' in  a letter sent out this weekend.

'There is also concern about my failure to address the conduct of one
 or more students who were involved in the incident. In retrospect, I 
understand how my statement has created these concerns,' Lyon said, the  Los Angeles Times reported.

These
 facts, paired with the student's alleged illegal activities have some 
area students, teachers and parents flocking to Black's side.

A
 petition called Reinstate Mark Black at Santa Monica High School has 
quickly appeared on Change.org with an accompanying Facebook page.

'Mark Black, longtime science teacher and wrestling coach at Santa Monica High School, was attacked on the morning of April 4, 2014,' reads the petition.

'Mr. Black, a wrestling coach with over 30 years experience, placed the student in a restraint hold to stop the student from further attacking him.  This was in an effort to get the situation under control,' it goes on to explain.

The Change.org page received nearly 2,000 signatures before the weekend was out and the Facebook page 'We support Coach Black of Samohi' had nearly 8,000 likes.

'Mark Black is an incredible man, coach, and mentor who has helped shape my son, and countless students, into incredible loving, responsible young adults,' wrote parent Tanja Elliott on the Change.org petition.

On Friday, Lyon wrote:

'As a parent, I know that we want our children to be safe at school. This is a fundamental expectation that I honor and respect. I am committed to ensure that any disciplinary action taken in this matter is based on facts, the law and all students’ right to a safe learning environment.'
