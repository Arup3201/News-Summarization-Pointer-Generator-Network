An invasion by millions of caterpillars has turned a graveyard into a spooky scene from a horror film.

Mourners at Sutton Road Cemetery in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, have been astounded by the phenomenon - with the caterpillars crawling along dozens of gravestones, benches and trees.

The bird cherry Ermine moth caterpillars, which have created web-like nests and left the graveyard with a ghostly white appearance, even hang from the trees on thin strands of their silken threads.

Mysterious: Mourners at Sutton Road Cemetery in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, have been astounded by the phenomenon - with the caterpillars crawling along dozens of gravestones, benches and trees.

Unusual sight: The bird cherry Ermine moth caterpillars, which have created web-like nests and left the graveyard with a ghostly white appearance, even hang from the trees on thin strands of their silken threads

Habitat: In their caterpillar stage, the bugs, known as web worms, weave leaves of trees together

There are no plans to remove the 
caterpillars, known as 'web worms', because they do not cause any damage
to the headstones and benches.

Julia
Heath, 42, who was left stunned when she visited the graveyard to lay 
flowers, said: ‘It really is quite a sight - I don’t think I have ever 
seen anything quite like this before.

The bird cherry Ermine moth is entirely harmless - unlike many other caterpillars that cause infestations.

They can be found across  Europe as well as in northern and eastern Asia.

Ranging in size from 0.6 to 1in, they live on bird cherry trees and make an extensive web-like nest.

They can eat an entire tree bare although many trees survive with reduced growth in the following growth seasons.

In 2011, 20 matures trees disappeared under a web of white silk in Birmingham when they experienced an infestation.

Experts
say there are often outbreaks in areas with a group of bird cherry 
trees - which are quite rare in England, compared to Scotland.

It
is not thought year-on-year climate variations affect the numbers of 
caterpillars - but it is believed the rise in reports of recent 
outbreaks may be simply because people are noticing the webs more, 
following increased publicity.

It is not for the faint-hearted because the caterpillars look like maggots or worms which really could make your stomach turn.

'But
there is something quite beautiful too in the way they create the 
ghostly white webs that hang from the trees. It would be the perfect 
setting for a scene from a horror movie - it reminds me of Tim Burton 
films like Sleepy Hollow.'

Following a similar phenomenon at the cemetery this time three years ago - which was also  reported by MailOnline - Southend Museum's natural history curator Roger Payne had said the caterpillars would emerge as moths in July.

The invasion is not the only of its kind seen this month. As reported last Thursday, a plague of the same bugs has covered pavements, walls and cars in Hampton, south-west London.

Today, Mr Payne told MailOnline: ‘Maybe they have received a bit of publicity recently and people are noticing them a bit more.

'Sometimes
you get really specific outbreaks and people notice. Often people see a
tree covered in webbing and think that is unusual and could be spiders.
They don't really connect it with thousands and thousands of small 
caterpillars.

‘I don't think the climate affects 
them very much. It just so happens that somebody long ago thought they would
plant bird cherry trees at the cemetery - and this is an unlimited 
supply.

‘It's probably a migrant moth that 
laid a few eggs there years ago. It's not a common tree around here in 
the South. The only thing that knocks them back a bit are wasp parasites.

‘So that is the main way in which the 
population is controlled, because birds don't seem to touch them - I 
suspect because they don't taste very nice. The web does offer some sort
of protection.’
