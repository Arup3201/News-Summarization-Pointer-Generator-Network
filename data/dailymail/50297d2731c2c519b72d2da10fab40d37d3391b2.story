The team behind Stephen Hawking biopic The Theory of Everything have revealed their next project is a Second World War drama about Winston Churchill.

Set to start filming next year, Darkest Hour focuses on the wartime Prime Minister's make-or-break decision to fight the Nazis alone.

In 1940, Germany had successfully invaded France while British forces were stranded at Dunkirk. 

Newly appointed Prime Minister, Churchill was facing mounting pressure to make a deal with Hitler as people began to lose faith the war could be won.

The team behind the Stephen Hawking biopic have announced they are working on a new film about Winston Churchill (pictured) 

But Churchill  refused to give up and was able to persuade his government that Britain had to fight, whatever the cost.

The film follows his decisions and immortal speeches which went onto define history.

Writer and producer of   Theory of Everything, Anthony McCarten, is the man behind the script for the Churchill biopic which he promised would reveal a side of the famous politician which had never been shown before.

McCarten joins fellow producer of the Academy Award nominated biopic Lisa Bruce and Working Title partners Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan for the epic war drama.

'We aim to present a Churchill you haven't seen before, a new portrait that shows all his famous strengths but also adds new dimensions, such as the grave doubts he privately harbored, the dark moods that would seize him unexpectedly and his fear of failure, a driving force that is often is left out of any discussion of the man,' McCarten told Yahoo.

'It is enormously exciting to be embarking on another project with Lisa Bruce and the Working Title team.'

Bruce added: 'This big screen portrait of a monumental figure navigating a treacherous moment in time brings forth a story that is stunningly relevant today.'

The film comes after the 50th anniversary of the passing of Churchill.

The Theory Of Everything starred Eddie Redmayne who plays theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking as he falls in love with his fist wife, played by Felicity Jones, and copes with his worsening motor neurone disease.

It garnered five Academy Award nomination including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar as well. Director James Marsh and the film's stars are also nominated.

This pivotal moment in the Second World War has been a long fascination for McCarten, who turns to this passion project after spending a decade getting Jane and Stephen Hawking to allow him to turn their complicated marriage into a film which grossed $82 million (£53.5 million) worldwide, won two Golden Globes and received ten BAFTA nominations to go along with its five Oscar nominations.  

At the beginning of the Second World War, the newly appointed Prime Minister Winston Churchill clashed with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax over whether Britain should continue fighting Nazi Germany.

After the successful invasion of France, and with British forces cut off at Dunkirk, Viscount Halifax, the Foreign Secretary, believed the war was not winnable and recommended Britain negotiate a peace settlement with Adolf Hitler.

He had warned that the war was no longer a question of defeating Germany but 'of safeguarding the independence of our own Empire' and warned that Britain should be ready to consider any proposals which might lead to that.

Churchill disagreed and said he could never accept  peace at the price of German domination over Europe and the UK.

He said: 'that nations which went down fighting rose again, but those which surrendered tamely were finished.'

Between 25 and 28 May Churchill and Halifax fought to bring the British War Cabinet round to their view.  

At one point, Halifax seemed to be gaining the upper hand, with Churchill facing the possibility of being forced from office.

But the Prime Minister was able to sway the government that the country had to fight, whatever the cost, with the now famous, impassioned speech to his Outer Cabinet in which he said: 'If this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground.'
