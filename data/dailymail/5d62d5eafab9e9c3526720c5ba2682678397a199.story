MSNBC's Rachel Maddow makes about $7 million annually, edging out Fox News' Megyn Kelly, who makes about $6 million per year, according to an survey released by TV Guide on Tuesday.

By comparison, the survey found that CBS' Scott Pelley makes $5 million annually and CNN's Chris Cuomo makes about $2.5 million.

All those salaries pale in comparison to 'Today' host Matt Lauer's, however, which was estimated at around $23.5 million.

Rachel Maddow, 40, is the host of The Rachel Maddow Show, which airs at 9 p.m. Mondays through Fridays

Kelly, 42, is the former host of 'America Live' from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. on the weekdays. She is reportedly moving to a primetime slot when she returns from maternity leave

Maddow, 40, is the host of The Rachel Maddow Show, which airs at 9 p.m. Mondays through Fridays. Kelly, 42, is the former host of 'America Live' from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., also on the weekdays. She is reportedly moving to a primetime slot when she returns from maternity leave.

Pelley, 56, is the anchor of CBS Evening News.

The data is from TV Guide's most recent annual salary survey of top network news anchors and other television stars - including actors and late night comedy hosts. 

The salary information was obtained through conversations with agents, studio heads and network executives, according to TV Guide. 

In the late night comedy category, 
Comedy Central's Jon Stewart was named as the highest paid with earnings
 of $25-30 million a year for hosting The Daily Show.

'Today' host Matt Lauer reportedly makes the most of any network news host. His annual salary is estimated at $22-$25 million

The 50-year-old Stewart outpaced past late night salary leaders Jay Leno and David Letterman, in an annual survey released by TV Guide on Tuesday.

The 63-year-old Leno took a pay cut last year with NBC and makes around $20 million a year after making nearly $30 million, while the 66-year-old Letterman also earns about $20 million a year.

The survey also showed that Ashton Kutcher, 35, remained the highest paid actor on the small screen with his $750,000 per episode salary for Two And A Half Men.

Mark Harmon was ranked second with $525,000 per episode of NCIS, plus a piece of the drama's profits. Claire Danes of Homeland and Michael Weatherly of NCIS tied for third at $250,000 per episode.
