Cheap fizz and Christmas puddings have beaten luxury rivals that can cost double the price in blind taste tests.

Sainsbury’s Blanc de Noirs champagne costs just £15 beating the far more posh Moët & Chandon, which is far more expensive at £31.99.

Meanwhile, an Aldi Christmas pudding at £6.99 was named a ‘best buy’, beating £15 offerings from the likes of Waitrose and Marks & Spencer.

The findings are reported today by Which? and suggest cash-strapped families can still enjoy a luxury Christmas without busting the household budget.

The consumer champion also advises shoppers buying festive food to wait until the last minute if they want to make a saving on crackers and mince pies.

However, Sainsbury’s has already cut the price of the Christmas products awarded ‘best buy’ status in the Which? tests. The Christmas pudding is down to £6.99, while the Blanc de Noirs champagne is £5.99 off at £15.

An expert panel, including chef Vera Ashpool, and Patrick Moore of the award winning bakery More? The Artisan Baker based in the Lake District, tested puddings nominated by nine major retailers.

Waitrose may be regretting putting forward its £14.99 Cherry and Almond Topped Christmas Pudding with Edible Glitter rather than its Heston Blumenthal Orange Christmas pudding.

The Heston pud, which has become a 
phenomenon and quickly sells out in the UK with the result a market has 
developed on the eBay auction site, is now sold as far away as 
Australia.

However, the offering nominated by Waitrose for the blind taste tests came bottom with a score of just 51 per cent.

The expert panel complained: ‘Syrup 
seeped from it when served, and our experts felt this made the texture 
sticky, while the sweetness overpowered the other flavours from spices 
and nuts.’

Top
 spot went to the Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Cognac Laced 
Christmas pudding at £12.90 for 900g, which came in with a score of 74 
per cent.

The judges praised its ‘great aroma and light texture’.

The best mix of value and flavour was
 offered by Aldi’s Specially Selected Luxury 12 month matured pudding at
 £6.99 for 750g, which was applauded as ‘attractive, warming and with 
good of alcohol’.

The third best buy was the Tesco Finest pudding with Courvoisier VS cognac at £7.99 for 907g.

Judges praised the lighter flavour, mellow alcohol taste and good spread of fruit and nuts in what is a  good value large pud.

A separate panel of wine experts, including Charles Metcalfe and Susy Atkins, assessed the best champagnes and sparkling wines.

The Sainsbury’s Blanc de Noirs 
champagne came top with a score of 86 per cent after judges praised its 
‘creamy texture, nutty and toasty flavours’. By contrast the famous Moët & Chandon
 managed just eight place in the league with a score of 73 per cent.

The ‘best buy’ accolade also went to a Marks & Spencer own label champagne, the De Saint Gall Blanc de Blancs Premier Cru at £28 a bottle.

In terms of cheaper sparkling wine, top place went to Morrisons with its Pongracz Brut from South Africa at £13.99 with judges praising its fresh fruity aroma.

There were two other best buys, including the M&S Single Estate Chadonnay Cava 2009 at £13.99 and the cheaper Sainsbury’s  Taste the Difference Vintage Cava Brut 2009 at £10.49.

Which? experts also survey festive food price changes to identify the cheapest time to buy. Its researchers found crackers and mince pies were cheapest in the 10 days before December 25, while November was the best option for Yule logs.

Across all Christmas food, Asda and Morrisons prices tended to stay the same more often, while Tesco and Sainsbury’s were more prone to changing prices and introducing offers during the Christmas period.

Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd said: ‘At the end of a really tough year for household finances, our research shows that people can still enjoy the best food and drink at Christmas without breaking the bank.

‘This will be welcome news for hard pressed families and confirms that it’s always better to shop around for the best deal.’
