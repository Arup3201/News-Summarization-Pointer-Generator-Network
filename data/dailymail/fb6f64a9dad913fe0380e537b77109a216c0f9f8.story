Police are asking for the public’s help identifying eight women who stormed a California sun glass store and made off with over $20,000 in merchandise.

The March 29 robbery of the Sunglass Hut at Valencia Town Center, in Santa Clarita, was caught on surveillance footage investigators hope will help them to solve the flash mob-style thefts.

Footage shows the group, believed to be between the ages of 18 and 25, crowding display cases and stuffing their bags with the eye wear just before 3.00 p.m. They continued to pilfer even as the clerk pleaded with them to stop.

The store clerk is helpless to stop the stealing as the large group of women huddles and steals, grabbing as much as they possibly can before bolting out the door.

The thieves only left after the worker dialled 911. They then ran out and jumped into a waiting SUV which sped out of the mall, police told CBS Los Angeles.

‘This is a flash mob type of situation, where a large number of people entered the location and quickly cleared out lots of merchandise, and fled” LA County Sheriff’s Deputy Joshua Dubin told the station.

The store said they stole at least $20,000 worth of inventory, according to the Santa Clarita Valley Signal.

This is not the first time a group of women has burglarized the second-floor store.

Three women teamed up last July to swipe almost $3,000 worth of sunglasses, according to a blotter published in the Signal.

One woman distracted the clerk while the other two made off with 11 pairs of sunglasses worth $2,970.

A MailOnline message left with the LA County Sheriff’s Office asking if the two robberies are related has yet to be returned.
