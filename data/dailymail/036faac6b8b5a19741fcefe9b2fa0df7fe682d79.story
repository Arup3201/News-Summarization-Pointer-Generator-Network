A huge swastika has been spotted at the bottom of a swimming pool in Brazil.

The offensive symbol was spotted in the southern state of Santa Catarina, by a police helicopter that was helping with a kidnapping investigation.

Police said the homeowner, who has not been named, would not be charged as the swastika is on private land and was not promoting Nazism.

The Santa Catarina region has a history of European immigration - including Germans and Austrians; the city of Blumenau hosts a Oktoberfest every year that 'preserves the customs of their ancestors from Germany to form colonies in the South

The swastika is believed to have been on the pool for 13 years. 

South America has had a long and unusual relationship with the Nazis who escaped there in droves after the Second World War. Nazis fled to Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and Bolivia.

The Santa Catarina region has a history of European immigration - including Germans and Austrians, according to CNN. The city of Blumenau hosts a Oktoberfest every year that 'preserves the customs of their ancestors from Germany to form colonies in the South'.

In 1967 Nazi hunters tracked down and arrested Franz Stangl in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1967. He was the commandant of the Sobibor and Treblinka extermination camps in Poland. He  died in a German prison in 1971.

Although the swastika has more recently been associated with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi part they adopted in the 1920s, it was long before thought of a sacred and auspicious symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.
