Vauxhall last night announced 550 new jobs at its two UK factories.

Some 300 of the new jobs will be at the firm's Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire taking employee numbers up to 1,900 to build the Astra.

The firm's van factory in Luton will take on an extra 250 workers to build the new Vivaro van taking the workforce up to 1,450 and back to two shifts.

The jobs boost was announced by Opel-Vauxhall's executive vice president and president of parent company General Motors Europe Karl-Thomas Neumann (Monday) during a visit to Britain.

He praised the motivation of the UK workforce compared to that of plants on the Continent and in the USA.

'It's an incredible turnaround. A year ago we were speculating which factory to close. Now we are announcing new jobs.'

A Vauxhall spokesman said: 'As its business grows and with another new model on the horizon Vauxhall has confirmed that it will take on 550 new employees at its manufacturing sites in Ellesmere Port and Luton, the first significant new-hire programme for a decade.'

He added: 'Around 300 new jobs will be secured at the Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire. The plant currently operates on two shifts but as sales volumes build more employees are required to cope with increased output at the facility. The new jobs will be phased in over the first quarter of 2015.'

In 2012, Ellesmere Port won the contract to build the next generation, all-new Astra. Production of this model begins towards the end of 2015.. The agreement runs into the next decade and secured a £125 million investment.

A second shift is to be added to the Luton van plant in January 2015, creating around 250 new jobs.

The Luton facility builds the recently launched all-new Vivaro van and will be taking on these new employees to increase output next year. In 2011, Luton won the contract to build the new Vivaro, entailing a £185 million investment.

'This is great news for Vauxhall and for British manufacturing,” said Tim Tozer, Vauxhall’s Chairman and Managing Director. “Both of our UK manufacturing plants have won long contracts with all-new product and as the business strengthens, we now need to take on more people to build these exciting new Vauxhalls.'
