Criminal charges have been laid against a 26-year-old passenger who was found hiding in the cockpit of a JetBlue plane at one of the busiest airports in the US.

Ground crew encountered the man about 30 minutes after JetBlue flight 810 landed at New York’s John F Kennedy International Airport from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

He stayed behind while other passengers disembarked following the four-hour flight and then entered the flight deck, where he was sat by the window when he was discovered yesterday.

Ground crew removed the New Jersey man from the Airbus A321 and turned him over to officers from the Port Authority Police Department, the airline said in a statement.

He was discovered shortly after 2:15am, and claimed he was hiding from a group of people who wanted to beat him up, local media reported.

While he was being removed from the plane he opened an alarm door, but never made it through or escaped the airline workers who were escorting him, NBC New York reported.

The man was taken to New York’s Jamaica Hospital Medical Center for observation and then released into the custody of police.

Jarrett Stroud, from Atlantic City, was charged with third-degree criminal trespassing, CBS New York reported. 

In 2013, a French man was discovered in the cockpit of a US Airways plane in Philadelphia.

He unsuccessfully sought a seat upgrade on the Florida-bound flight and used a fraudulent Air France ID card to gain access to the cockpit.

The card belonged to a former employee.

The man was arrested after he was found in the jump seat behind the pilots’ chairs.
