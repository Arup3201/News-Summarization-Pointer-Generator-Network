Prestigious hotel Gleneagles is selling off an acre of land on a neighbouring street for £1million – with a golf course membership thrown in.

Located just yards from the 2014 Ryder Cup PGA Centenary Course and with planning permission for a 'substantial' six-bedroom house, it could be a golfer's dream home.

The price of the land on one of Scotland's most expensive streets has been slashed from £1.55million to £1million, despite a similar neighbouring plot selling for £1.7million.

But the lucky purchaser will still have to dig deeply to build the six-bedroom home in Auchterarder, Perthshire, as it has permission for a four-car garage, pool, gym and sauna.

The one-acre plot located yards from one of the golf courses at Gleneagles is on the market for £1million

The buyers will also  get two years' free golf club membership and access to all the luxury facilities.

While the plot is already hooked up to mains water and electricity, it will have to be connected to the Gleneagles Hotel private drainage scheme, for which an annual levy will be payable.  

Anna Gardiner, for selling agents Savills, said: 'Caledonian Crescent is a broad private street lined with substantial houses set within generous and established gardens.

'In recent years it had become known as one of the Scotland's premier residential streets.

The world-famous hotel (pictured) in Scotland has three championship course - the King's Course, the Queen's Course and the Centenary Course - as well as the nine hole 'Wee Course'

The plot on the right was sold for £1.7million but the price of the remaining acre (left) has been slashed to £1million

'A number of substantial modern mansions have been built on the sites of some of the original dwellings or on greenfield sites at the foot of the crescent.

'It is a great opportunity, especially as the plot is fully serviced and good to go.

'The setting is second to none in such a peaceful position so close to all the Gleneagles Hotel facilities.'

She added that the price tag will afford the buyer a secluded and exclusive retreat.

'It's all about exclusivity. The site is pretty special - you don't get this quality of plot anywhere else,' she said.

'It's really a lifestyle you are buying into. The kind of people who will be interested will be looking for a substantial house.

The buyers will also get two years' free golf club membership and access to all the luxury facilities, pictured is the entrance to the plot 

'Golf is obviously the big draw but also the fact that the hotel facilities are on your doorstep, giving you access to fine dining and the spa.'

The five star hotel - dubbed a 'Riviera in the Highlands' - charges up to £2,000-a-night for a suite.

It counts the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge among its high profile guests, along with Sir Sean Connery and John Travolta.

Last year, the golf course was the venue for Ryder Cup, and residents of Auchterarder, despite living a few minutes' walk away, enjoyed shuttle buses to the event.

The plot for sale in Caledonian Crescent has previously been on the market for over £1.55million and a neighbouring, almost identical piece of land, was snapped up for £1.7million a few years ago.

In 2009 the street was named as the most expensive in Scotland by the property website Zoopla, with the average house price sitting at £1.6million

When it was opened in 1924, Gleneagles was described as 'a Riviera in the Highlands' and 'the eighth wonder of the world'

Rettie estate agent Chris Hall said: 'Only one sold for £1.67m. Gleneagles withdrew the second hoping the market conditions would improve.'

The agent admitted: 'The plot price has come down significantly. To buy a plot for £1million or more and develop a house is a significant investment.

'People who can afford that already have nice houses. It's a discretionary decision rather than one driven by a need.'

He said: 'The current reduced price level is an attractive opportunity for some people.

'For those familiar with Gleneagles, Caledonian Crescent is very well known. There are six very substantial new build homes with build costs ranging from £2million to £7million.

'I'm not aware of any other street that rivals it in that respect.'

Residents of Caledonian Crescent only have a five minute stroll to the entrance to the hotel, where they can dine in the two star Michelin restaurant run by Andrew Fairlie.

In 2007 Strathearn Lodge on Caledonian Crescent was labelled the most expensive new home on sale in the country being marketed at offers over £3.75million.

Meanwhile the street came out top of Zoopla's Scottish Property Rich List 

In 2009 the street was named as the most expensive in Scotland by the property website Zoopla, with the average house price sitting at £1.6million.

The world-famous hotel in Scotland has three championship courses, the King's Course, the Queen's Course and the Centenary Course as well as the nine hole 'Wee Course'.

When it was opened in 1924, Gleneagles was described as 'a Riviera in the Highlands' and 'the eighth wonder of the world'.

It most recently hosted the 2014 Ryder Cup which saw Team Europe beat Team USA 16½ to 11½ to complete a hat-trick of successive wins in the tournament. 

The hotel was built by the former Caledonian Railway Company, with its own railway station just minutes away, and is now owned by Diageo plc.

In 1919 The King's and Queen's courses opened on the same day, but  The King's but was only nine holes until it was completed as a full 18 in 1925. 

When the Second World War broke out in 1939 the hotel closed and became a military hospital and then a miners' rehabilitation centre. It reopened as a hotel in May 1947.

In 1993 the PGA Centenary Course, created by Jack Nicklaus, opened to complement the renowned King's and Queen's courses and form one of the world's finest golfing venues.
