It's not just in the music charts 
that Rihanna is a hit - her clothing line for River Island has been a 
huge success for the British High Street store since it's launch at London Fashion Week in February.

Following
 on from the popularity of her first two collections, her AW13 range has now landed in store.

Fans will be disappointed to know that this is the singer's final line for the High Street stalwart, but she promises it is set to be her best yet.

Out with a bang: Rihanna has unveiled her final collection for River Island and promises fashion fans that it is her best yet

The
 80-piece collection incorporates a mix of urban sports luxe with city chic - a style that Rihanna champions and wears so well.

With a strong emphasis on clean yet glamorous 
dressing and a nod to streamlined sportswear, her latest offering is bound to be a hit with fashion fans.

In a nod to the season's hottest catwalk trends, there is plenty of metallic,
 tartan, camouflage, floral, stripes, wet look fabrics and denim leathers.

The Pour It Up singer most certainly had the party season in mind when she created the
 glittering dresses, strappy heels and skintight skirts.

Keeping in line with the her tomboy style, there's also plenty of casual pieces like denim jumpsuits, mesh dresses and beanies that her sometimes BFF Cara Delevingne is bound to be sporting in no time.
