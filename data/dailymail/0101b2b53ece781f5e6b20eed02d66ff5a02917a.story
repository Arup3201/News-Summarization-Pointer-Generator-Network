It's widely perceived that portion control is an important factor in weight loss, but it appears this may not necessarily be the case.

In former Food Network host Lisa Lillien's new book The Hungry Girl Diet, she explains how eating huge portions of low-calorie foods can help you shed up to ten pounds in just four weeks.

The diet emphasizes swapping out calorific foods like pasta and bread crumbs for low-calorie alternatives like tofu noodles and high fiber cereals, adding up to a daily intake of about 1,300 calories.

The trick of the diet plan, she says, is that 'you get a lot of bang for your calorie buck.'

The Hungry Girl Diet book features four weeks of recipes to help you jump-start your weight loss, with alternative meal plans if there are certain foods you don't like.

She also suggests using broccoli slaw or tofu noodles in place of spaghetti for a healthier pasta dish, and crushed cereal in lieu of bread crumbs when making breaded chicken.

While her book was approved by a dietician, Ms Lillien emphasizes that she is not a nutritionist herself, but simply 'a typical woman battling the same food issues most females struggle with every day'.

As such, the diet promises to keep you full and satisfied as well as banish cravings.
