Joachim Low has hinted that he could leave his role as Germany manager to return to club management role in the not too distant future.

The 54-year-old, who has been in charge of the national side since July 2006, has admitted he is open about his future job prospects. 

He told Kicker: 'I would rule nothing out just now. It's very conceivable of course that at some point I will coach a club team again. Why not?

Low was Jurgen Klinsmann's assistant for two years before coming Germany manager in July 2006

'I've trained myself to think about my future only every two years. As a coach I know that there will be a decision after every tournament. In 2012, the mood was very different from 2010. It changes.

'But there is no curse of the title, as I sometimes read.'

Low last managed a club side in the 2003-2004 season, spending eight months at FK Austrian Wien - where he averaged a 50% win percentage. 

Germany are currently second in their European Championship qualifying group with seven points, three points behind the leaders Poland.
