A new high-tech 'mirror' means shoppers need no longer try clothes on - because it shows the latest garments on a digital scan of your body.

The virtual wardrobe will save time by using a motion-capture camera to produce a realistic 3D image of each customer as they stand in front of the 6ft 6in screen.

The computer even selects a range of clothing and accessories it believes will suit the shopper's shape and size, and presents them on the display.

The new high-tech 'mirror' means shoppers need no longer try clothes on - because it shows the latest garments on a digital scan of your body

The device, hailed as 'every woman's dream invention', uses Microsoft's motion sensing technology, Kinect 3D

Shoppers can then use a simple wave of their hand to choose which ones they wish to 'try on', and instantly see what it looks like.

The system - available in High Street shops this summer - is so advanced it can show how clothes hang from the shoulders and cling to the body.

The device, hailed as 'every woman's dream invention', uses Microsoft's motion sensing technology, Kinect 3D.

The technology brings to life the 1995 film Clueless, in which Alicia Silverstone's character Cher used a computer to help her decide what to wear.

The virtual wardrobe was unveiled at The Microsoft Apartment in Covent Garden, London, today.

It will be used at pop-up stores on the High Street and at airports this summer, and will be available to buy for home use by 2016.Â 

Customers can share the images with family and friends through social networking sites to gauge their opinion before buying

Eoghan O'Sullivan, from augmented reality firm Von Bismark, said: 'The interactive mirror shows people how an item of clothing, handbag, or accessory might look on them.

'It works by motion capture, allowing it to immediately identify a woman's size and shape.

'The software then tells the garment how to sit on the body - whether that's how a dress hangs off the shoulders, or how a pair of trousers hang off the hips.'

Rahul Sood, from Microsoft, said:'The relationship between design and technology is becoming ever more important when applied to modern fashion startups.

'This system takes depth data from the moving Kinect camera, in real time, to create highest quality, geometrically accurate 3D models.

'Gesture control and skeletal tracking enables an exciting shopping experience.

'We believe this will come to revolutionise the UK shopping experience on the High Street for women and men.'

Office worker Rebecca Hughes, 28, from Brighton, East Sussex, said the new device was 'every woman's dream invention'.

She added: 'Going clothes shopping can be an extremely time-consuming and stressful experience.

'It can be a nightmare traipsing from shop to shop, trying to find an outfit that fits and looks stylish at the same time.

'Standing in changing rooms trying on dress after dress for hours on end can be soul-destroying.

'To be able to stand in front of a 'virtual mirror' that chooses clothes for you and immediately shows you how you look in them is fantastic.

'This has to be every woman's dream invention.'
