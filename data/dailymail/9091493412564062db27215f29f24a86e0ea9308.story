Christina opted for a long-sleeved dark gown with deep V-neck and had her blonde hair down while making her Oscars red carpet debut.

Awards date: Clint Eastwood brought girlfriend Christina Sandera to the Academy Awards on Sunday in Hollywood

The Dirty Harry franchise star directed the biographical war drama American Sniper that was nominated for six awards at the Oscars - including Best Picture. 

The hit film has earned more than $428 million at the box office and has become Clint's most successful film and the highest-grossing war film, but only took home the Oscar for Best Sound Editing.

The actor and director also was a producer of the biopic about US Navy SEAL marksman Chris Kyle who was the deadliest sniper in US military history with 255 kills.

New relationship: Clint had his divorce from wife Dina Eastwood finalised in December

Clint and Dina Eastwood had their divorce after 18 years of marriage finalised in December.

Dina, 49, filed for divorce in October 2013 but the pair had been fighting over the custody of their daughter Morgan, 18, and spousal support.

Terms of the financial settlement were not disclosed and the custody issue became moot as Morgan turned 18 during the prolonged divorce proceedings.

Clint and Christina were spotted grocery shopping together in June in Los Angeles.

Clint previously was married to Maggie Johnson before Dina and also had long relationships with Sondra Locke and Frances Fisher.
