A judge has ruled that an Alabama man with a bizarre facial tattoo who is accused of shooting his mother's boyfriend dead will not stand trial for the crime but continue his psychiatric treatment.

Dwayne Batice Miller, 30, allegedly shot Frederick Edwards, 47, at the Mobile home they both shared with Miller's mother in 2010.

Miller, whose forehead bears the misspelled word 'cheif' in tattooed letters, will now be recommitted for his fourth year of psychiatric therapy at the Taylor Hardin Secure Medical Facility, a judge ruled Wednesday.

According to AL.com, Mobile police found the murder weapon at the scene.

Miiler was taken into custody at the scene and charged later that night.

In 2011, Miller was found incompetent to stand trial.

On Wednesday, forensic examiner Dr Robert Bare told the court that Miller 'continues to exhibit symptoms of mental illness and cognitive defects.'

According to Bare's report, Miller 
suffers from psychotic, antisocial personality and bipolar disorders, 
chronic substance abuse, and has borderline intellectual functioning but
 'lacks insight' into his own condition and need for treatment.

Life of crime: Miller was arrested twice in April of 2006 for reckless endangerment, possession and menacing

According to AL.com, Miller became frustrated recently and told his treatment team, 'They say I have a mental illness, but I don't.'

Miller's attorney said he should be found not guilty of the murder by reason of insanity, but the judge declined to do so, instead taking the matter under submission and recommitting Miller to psychiatric care.

As well as 'cheif,' which the New York 
Daily News reports is slang for smoking marijuana, Miller's face also 
has an illustration of a skull and crossbones.
