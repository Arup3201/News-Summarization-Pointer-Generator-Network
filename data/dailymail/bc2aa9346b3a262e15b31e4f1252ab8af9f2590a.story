Samuel L. Jackson is giving FEMAIL readers the exclusive chance to win a £500 Harrods shopping spree.

All they have to do is enter an online raffle and donate to his charity One For The Boys on new crowdfunding website MyGoodness.com.

The Hollywood actor has teamed up with the innovative London-based fundraising platform to raise awareness and money for his charity - and now FEMAIL readers have an extra incentive to get involved.

Jackson: 'By not getting checked you could lose those balls. Hell - you could lose your life! So boys, don't be dumb'

Jackson 
decided to support One For The Boys after he learned that friends had 
secretly coped with cancer without telling anybody. 

And
 now, people who enter the online raffle and donate have the chance to 
win a money can't buy experience including a luxury weekend in London 
and lunch with Samuel L. Jackson himself.

They
 will also receive an invitation to join the legendary actor and his friends at the 
fashion ball he's hosting on 15th June 15 benefit One for The Boys.

In addition to this grand prize, MyGoodness will offer exclusive rewards.

Those
 who contribute £5 or more will get an exclusive DVD or poster, donors 
of £100 and the 'top sharers' (donors who get the most friends to make a
 donation) will have the actor follow them on Twitter.

Jackson: 'I offer you the chance to hang out with me in London, fully clothed by then, all you need to do is hit on MyGoodness.com and buy a raffle ticket or loads of them... to support One For The Boys'

FEMAIL winners get exclusive prizes including a £500 Harrods shopping spree

And for the very top donors who contribute £1,000 or more, Jackson will record a bespoke voicemail on their mobile phone. 

MyGoodness
 will offer FEMAIL donors exclusive rewards when they enter via http://www.mygoodness.com/daily. First prize is a 
£500 Harrods shopping spree, second is a mini speaker Jawbone and third a UP wrist band. These are gifted on top of the incredible prize of meeting Jackson and going to the ball.

The competition ends May 29 and winners will be announced June 2. Prizes for FEMAIL winners will be released June 5.

To support the campaign, Jackson recently shared a video he recorded with his 3.7m Twitter followers.

In it he urges men to visit a doctor to 'get themselves checked out'.

He highlights the fact that a staggering 30 per cent more men than women die of cancer in the UK.

The
 Captain America star makes a passionate - and occasionally X-rated - 
plea to men everywhere to be more open about sensitive medical issues, 
and to see a GP as soon as symptoms occur.

The clip - which is longer than two 
minutes and was recorded in one smooth take - includes the following 
soundbites from one of Hollywood's most celebrated speechmakers.

'By not 
getting checked you could lose those balls. Hell - you could lose your 
life! So boys, don't be dumb. If you've really got balls, show them to 
your doctor...

'I
 offer you the chance to hang out with me in London, fully clothed by 
then, all you need to do is hit on MyGoodness.com and buy a raffle 
ticket or loads of them... to support One For The Boys.'

'Fact:
 30 percent more men die of cancer than women. Whaaat? Get outta here! 
That's right: 30 percent. 30 motherf****** percent. Why? Because they 
don't get themselves checked out early enough. They don't want to hear 
or talk about it, because it ain't the manly thing to do. They're too 
macho.'

MyGoodness.com
 enables the socially conscious shopper to find stylish handpicked 
products while also giving back to great causes and charities.

People who enter the online raffle and donate can win lunch with Samuel L. Jackson and an invite to his benefit ball. FEMAIL donors can win exclusive prizes including a £500 Harrods shopping spree

The opportunity to meet the Pulp Fiction star is the first of the company's new line of money can't buy experiences.

'We are 
very excited to work with MyGoodness,' says Jackson, 'because Nathalie and Severine are 
genuine philanthropists and were keen to provide us their platform to 
raise money and awareness for One For The Boys.

'We
 wanted to raffle off a 'money can't buy' experience to promote male 
cancer awareness and MyGoodness was a perfect match for this campaign.'
