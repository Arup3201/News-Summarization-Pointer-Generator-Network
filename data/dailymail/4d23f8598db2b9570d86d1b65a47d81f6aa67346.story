Hundreds of the most vulnerable victims of the civil war in Syria will be able to seek refuge in Britain, in a deal brokered last night.

Precedence will be given to the most extreme cases such as women and children at risk of sexual violence, the elderly, survivors of torture and people with disabilities, Nick Clegg announced.

The Deputy Prime Minister said Britain had a ‘moral responsibility’ to help alleviate the suffering in the region, where more than 100,000 people have died and many millions displaced from their homes.

The plan was agreed last night after 
weeks of talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats about how
 to respond to the Syrian conflict, which has raged for almost three 
years.

David Cameron has 
come under pressure from Mr Clegg, Labour’s Ed Miliband and Ukip leader 
Nigel Farage to join the countries currently offering sanctuary to some 
of the refugees.

More than 
11.5million people inside Syria and those who have fled to neighbouring 
countries are in need of food, shelter and medical treatment.

Mr
 Cameron appears to have overcome objections from the Home Office by 
agreeing to let in ‘hundreds’ of vulnerable people, but without joining 
the United Nations quota system.

'Moral responsibility': Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Britain had to act

The
 UN High Commission for Refugees is calling for Western nations to admit
 30,000 Syrians between them. But last week immigration minister Mark 
Harper said the quota system only provides ‘token relief’.

A
 government source said there were concerns that quotas would encourage a
 ‘box ticking culture’ among other countries who have not matched 
Britain’s record on aid to the region.

The UK is the second largest bilateral donor having given £600million aid to help refugees in the region.

Sources said the deal was supported by Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg and there had not been a ‘Whitehall battle’ over it.

‘We
 will be looking case-by-case at the most vulnerable to see if we can 
help them’, a source said. The number is expected to be ‘in the 
hundreds’ to be brought here over the coming months and to start ‘very 
quickly’.

Home Secretary Theresa May will set out the new policy today in a parliamentary debate about the UK’s response to the crisis.

At
 least 1,500 people have already been able to settle in the UK through a
 programme to help those with existing family ties. But in the Commons 
last week, the Prime Minister warned that small quotas would have to be 
considered carefully in a crisis involving millions of people.

Mr
 Clegg said last night that Britain had now agreed to provide refuge to 
those ‘most traumatised’ by the crisis without setting specific targets.
 The UN, which backs the UK’s stance, will help identify these people.

Mr Clegg said: ‘I am pleased to be 
able to announce that the UK will be providing refuge to some of the 
most vulnerable Syrian refugees. The Coalition Government wants to play 
our part in helping to alleviate the immense suffering in Syria.

‘The
 £600million we have provided makes us the second largest bilateral 
donor of humanitarian aid in the world. But as the conflict continues to
 force millions of Syrians from their homes, we need to make sure we are
 doing everything we can.’

He said they intended to target those 
‘in greatest need’ and continue to support the peace talks underway in 
Geneva between the Assad regime and opposition forces to find a 
political solution.

Mr Clegg
 added: ‘We are one of the most open hearted countries in the world and I
 believe we have a moral responsibility to help.

'Britain
 has a long and proud tradition of providing refuge at times of crisis. 
This Coalition Government will ensure it lives on.’

More Syrians in Istanbul: It is estimated that 
more than 11.5million people inside Syria and those who have fled to 
neighbouring countries are in urgent need of food, shelter and medical 
treatment

No target will be set for the numbers of 
refugees to be admitted, with the UK instead working with the UNHCR on a
 case-by-case basis to identify those most in need of assistance.

Refuge
 will be offered to some of those most traumatised by the crisis, 
including vulnerable women and children, who are expected to arrive on a
 gradual basis over the coming months.

Shadow home secretary Yvette 
Cooper said: ‘Vulnerable Syrian refugees, torture victims, abandoned 
children and those struggling to cope or survive in the camps 
desperately need sanctuary and Britain has a moral obligation to help.

‘I am very glad the Government has finally bowed to pressure before tomorrow's opposition vote.

The
 UK representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Roland 
Schilling, said: ‘This decision will help to provide much needed 
solutions for vulnerable Syrian refugees many of whom have been deeply 
traumatised and face immense hardship.

‘It is also a concrete and 
important gesture of solidarity and burden sharing with the countries 
neighbouring Syria as they continue to bear the brunt of the refugee 
crisis.

‘Today's decision is an encouraging and important step, 
reaffirming the UK's commitment and contribution to international relief
 efforts in support of more than 2.3 million Syrian refugees and the 
countries hosting them.’

Refugee Council chief executive Maurice Wren said: ‘This news, quite simply, will transform people's lives.

‘What's more, it also sends an important message to the rest of the

world:
 Britain has a proud tradition of protecting and welcoming refugees and 
we will continue to lead the way in offering refuge to people in their 
greatest hour of need.

‘We commend the Government for upholding this 
reputation by going the extra mile and offering protection to some of 
the most vulnerable refugees who will now have chance to rebuild their 
lives in safety.’

Amnesty International UK director Kate Allen said: 
‘This move is long overdue but of course it's never too late to do the 
right thing.

‘The government's line on this has been shameful, with months of refusal and weak arguments.

‘It
 was a never a matter of choosing between helping refugees in the region
 or helping refugees in this country - and it's an enormous relief that 
the government has finally changed its mind on this.

‘For some of the most vulnerable refugees, this offer is a lifeline.

It's literally a matter of life and death.’
