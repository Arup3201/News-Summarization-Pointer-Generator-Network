As fears grow that the deadly Ebola virus is spreading one of fashion's biggest names has expressed her concerns and plans to help raise awareness.

Naomi Campbell, the world-famous supermodel, told Page Six in New York this week that she was becoming increasingly concerned about the disease. 

'I'm scared,' she told Page Six. The 44-year-old model expressed her worries to the paper while adding that she has a home in Kenya and works with three orphanages there.

Naomi Campbell announced plans to host a Fashion for Relief show in aid of Ebola on Tuesday night 

And Naomi is determined to support the fight against Ebola with Vogue.co.uk reporting that she has announced plans for a charity fashion show.

The Fashion for Relief catwalk will aim to help victims of the virus but the model revealed that she also hopes to educate the public on the subject as she believes very little is known about the illness. 

'People don't have a clear idea about what Ebola is' adding that she wants to make people aware that 'Ebola does not discriminate.'

Naomi's ambitious plans came about on Tuesday night after attending her friend Charlotte Tilbury's make-up launch at Bergdorf Goodman in New York.

This was the second time this week that we have seen the model express her charitable side as on Tuesday she posted her #wakeupcall selfie. 

The new internet craze involves celebrities posting selfies of themselves as they wake up in bed - and aims to raise money and awareness for UNICEF.

Naomi's recent dabble in fund raising is nothing new for the model. Her plans for her charitable catwalk is not the first time that Naomi has called upon the fashion industry to help raise money for charity, with Fashion for Relief having been successfully established back in 2005. 

The first show raised money for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and she has since used the project to raise funds following the India terrorist attacks in 2009, the Haiti earthquake in 2010, and the most recent being Japan earthquake and tsunami in 2011.

Every show thus far has included a star-studded runway including the likes of Kate Moss, Shirley Bassey, Beyonce and even Bruce Forsyth previously taking part. 

To date Fashion for Relief has raised an estimate £4.5million for charity.
