Train passengers were astonished when the conductor told them to ‘beware of gipsies’ as they pulled in to a station.

The London Midland service was stopping in Shropshire on Saturday when the announcer said: ‘Now approaching Telford Central. Beware of gipsies and pickpockets.’

Many passengers and residents reacted with disgust at the offensive comments.

Father-of-three Mark Peaker, 47, from Telford, said: ‘I couldn’t believe what I was hearing – they have not only used a derogatory term they have managed to offend an entire town.

'Somebody in a professional role should not be insulting places while they are working.

'I’m all for them having a sense of humour but this was not funny at all and I hope he is disciplined.’

The Gipsy Council today called for the matter to be taken up with the police and branded the remarks racist.

Bill Kerswell, a spokesman for the council, said: 'This is unlawful, it is a racist comment.

'It is the same as using any offensive word relating to homosexuals or people of colour.

'I would think it is a police matter and I hope they take it up and look into it.'

A London Midland spokesman said the operator had been unaware of the incident but had launched an investigation, adding: ‘We do not tolerate any sort of comment of that kind made by anyone on our trains.’
