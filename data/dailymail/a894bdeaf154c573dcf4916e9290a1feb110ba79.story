Three Filipino girls featured in a U.S. documentary on sex trafficking have helped to convict a Pennsylvania child pornographer who forced them to act out his disturbing sexual fantasies live through the internet.

Jeffrey Herschell, 54, of Washington was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison on Tuesday after the brave girls described the horror they were made to endure from the age of eight to a CNN film crew, then to U.S. authorities.

'Whatever the American client wants us to do, we must do it,' 'Gen' told CNN in May 2011 for the documentary 'The Fighters,' which aired earlier this month. Traffickers in Manilas, who are behind the camera, charge men like Herschell around $27 an hour to 'direct' the online streams.

The shocking details led Homeland 
Security Investigations agents to Herschell's Pennsylvania home in 2011 
where they found computers, cell phones and hard drives containing 
dozens of explicit videos and images of children.

In January, he pleaded guilty for coercing and enticing a minor and possessing child pornography and was sentenced on Tuesday.

One of the investigators told CNN the information the three girls provided him was integral to the case against the America.

In the documentary, which was made as part of CNN's Freedom Project over two years, the girls described Americans as 'maniacs,' adding, sharply: 'You need to stop victimizing girls like us.'

One of the girls described how men at internet cafes 'tell me to take my clothes off and then they make me dance. I was kind of embarrassed because I'm not used to being naked like that.'

According to the disturbing documentary, customers on the other side of the sex chat room paid $27 an hour to tell the girls what to do and the camera man would ensure the girls followed the, often freaky, orders.

The girls told how they were made to 
perform sex acts with Westerners coming in off the street and that 
sometimes animals were sometimes involved in the abuses that were 
streamed.

'Sometimes we had to urinate,' one of the girls said on the program, and her friend added that the urine was mixed with juice as a drink.

'That's what the American client wants. He demands anyone who feels like urinating should do so, but that he wants us to do it in front of the camera,' she recalled.

The inquiry into Herschell involved several U.S. agencies, the Philippines national police and the non-profit group Visayan Forum Foundation, which fights modern-day slavery.

UNICEF estimates as many as 100,000 children work in the illegal sex trade in the Philippines, obviously leaving them suffering severe trauma.

Cecilia Flores-Oebanda, the director of the Visayan Forum Foundation, which cares for rescued girls described to CNN how often girls would wake up in the middle of the night screaming and crying because they are so frightened the trafficker will come again.

'Sometimes one of the kids suddenly gets sick and vomits,' she said. 'Our psychologist said it's because she remembers what these guys on the Internet asked her to do.'
