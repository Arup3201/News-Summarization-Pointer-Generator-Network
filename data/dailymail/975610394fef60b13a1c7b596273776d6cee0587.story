A secret police dossier on worldwide outlaw motorcycle gang, the Hells Angels, details murder, rape, assaults on women, drugs, fraud, car bombings, drive by shootings, bashings, standover and extortion going back years.

The file obtained by the MailOnline is part of a 13,000-page brief of crimes and violence which police in NSW will use as a national test case to outlaw bikie gangs around Australia as organised crime groups.

Police list 80 violent or illegal acts committed by a membership of just 46 Hells Angels bikies.

The case will be  watched closely by the international Hells Angels organisation, and bike gangs and law enforcement agencies around the world.

They are criminals: Sydney police have documented in a court application over thousands of pages of crimes and atrocities they say the Hells Angels (right) committed going back decades against rival gangs like the Finks  and which they will use as a national test case to outlaw bikie gangs around Australia

The chilling catalogue of atrocities tendered in court by the NSW Commissioner of Police includes crimes never prosecuted because the victims or witnesses were intimidated by Hells Angels members, a practice which the document lists among the club rules.

The submission originally filed to the Supreme Court of NSW lists the names of the gang's full members, prospects, or probationary members, and 'hangarounds' - would be Hells Angels bikies, as well as strict codes of silence and discipline.

Club rules prohibit membership for 'black men, police officers (current or former), women and informants'.

The inventory of crimes includes gang wars between the Hells Angels and their sworn enemies, the Finks, the Comanchero, the Nomads, the Lones Wolves and the former Notorious gang associated with Sam Ibraham, a convicted kidnapper.

The NSW Gangs Squad which is currently collating the dossier for the police commissioner to place before the NSW Supreme Court for a new application say they are prepared for a fight by Hells Angels lawyers.

Gang lawyers representing former Hells Angels president Derek Wainohu previously mounted a challenge in the High Court of Australia - and won - on the grounds the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act contravened club members' human rights.

Wainohu argued the law infringed on his 'implied constitutional freedom of political communication and political association'.

The full bench of the High Court agreed and ordered the NSW Government pay the Hells Angels' costs.

Hands off my human rights: Former Hells Angels president Derek James Wainohu (above) was the face of a High Court challenge against the NSW Police Commissioner's attempt to have his club deemed illegal. Wainohu argued the legislation infringed on his 'constitutional freedom of political communication and political association'. A new NSW Police application documenting claims of four decades of crimes and atrocities by the Hells Angels is being prepared

The High Court said that to declare the Hells Angels an outlawed criminal gang, a judge 'had to be satisfied that the members of the organisation associated for the purposes of organising, planning, facilitating, supporting or engaging in serious criminal activity and that the organisation represented a risk to public safety and order'.

The dossier of crimes the police have tendered to prove the Hells Angels are engaged in 'serious criminal activity' starts with a 1972 murder when seven members of the Finks gang gunned down a Hells Angels bikie as he arrived at his clubhouse in Mascot, near Sydney Airport.

In 1989, police said a club 'hangaround', who was hoping to become a gang prospect, was arrested in possession of a loaded revolver and illegal drugs on a street in the NSW coastal town of Coffs Harbour.

The application submitted by the NSW Police Commissioner to the court listed the following crimes it says were committed on specific dates by the Hells Angels and other clubs:

On February 13, 1995, a Hells Angels bikie entered the home of his ex-girlfriend armed with a knife and assaulted, wounded and raped her. Charges were withdrawn after the victim refused to attend court due to fears for her safety.

On May 11, 1995 A Lone Wolf member who later patched over to the Hells Angels, was charged with the murder of a young man who came to the aid of his father who was being assaulted by other bikies in a western Sydney hotel. The charges were eventually dropped.

In 1998, Hells Angels prospect Zeljko Mitrovic was convicted for his involvement in the ambush and shooting at Bankstown of two men who died from multiple gunshot wounds.

On July 13, 1998, Hells Angel David Newham is killed in a drive-by shooting at the clubhouse in western Sydney.

In 2000, Peter Sidirourgos manufactured commercial quantities of methylamphetamine from pseudoephedrine in cough and cold tablets for the syndicate in Sydney's western suburbs.

Jailed for 35 years: Christopher Hudson (left) shot dead solicitor Brendan Keilar (right) in the street. He had come to the aid of his killer's girlfriend

On May 23, 2001 a prospective member along with three accomplices bashed two men with baseball bats, causing serious head injuries.

On January 27, 2001, prior to joining the Hells Angels, two men caused an underage girl to become intoxicated and forced her to perform oral sex on both of them.

They robbed her of $100 and left her in an apartment. The victim later declined to attend court.

On June 23, 2002, two Hells Angels attempted to rape a pregnant woman.

They assaulted her on a bed slat in a unit in south-western Sydney and demanded she have an abortion. She was believed to have moved interstate after the assault and no charges were laid.

The following year, one of the men lent his car to an associate and after the vehicle was damaged in an accident, threatened the man and his parents.

Months later, two Hells Angels kicked in the panels of the man's car at an intersection, but charges were withdrawn after the complainant said he feared reprisals.

On June 27, 2003, a Hells Angels club member and another male assaulted a 56-year-old shopkeeper in Queanbeyan, near Canberra, with a loaded pistol and demanded $100,000. The man declined to make a statement for fear of retribution.

Murdered in Melbourne peak hour: Father of three, solcitior Brendan Keilar, 43, was shot in Melbourne's CBD by Hells Angels, Christopher Wayne Hudson, after Mr Keilar went to the assistance of two women Hudson was threatening. Keilar died  on the street. Hudson is serving 35 years to life

On June 30, 2006, a former Hells Angels prospect threatened the owner of a childcare centre in Sydney's south-west after his wife was sacked from the business. He threatened to burn down the centre 'with everyone in it'.

June, 2007: Christopher Hudson fires at Melbourne police after a night of drinking with Collingwood footballer Alan Didak. On June 18, drunk and armed with a pistol, he assaults a stripper and drags his 24-year-old girlfriend Kaera Douglas on a street in central Melbourne during morning peak hour.

When two men came to the women's aid, Hudson wounds Dutch backpacker, Paul de Waard, shoots Douglas in the stomach and shoots solicitor Brendan Keilar who dies in the street.  Hudson is serving 35 years jail.

A club prospect and two other men assaulted a man on September 1, 2007, beating him unconscious and lleaving the victim with a permanent brain injury. After his release from prison, McLeod became a full member.

Then a Hells Angels hangaround, on August 20, 2008 a member was involved in the kidnapping from Rose Bay in Sydney's eastern suburbs and assault of Daniel Elahi, forcing him to transfer $84,000 in assets. He was convicted.

On June 16, 2008 members of the Notorious Outlaw Motorcycle gang fire shots into the Hells Angels Sydney Chapter clubhouse.

IIn retaliation, on July 15 a bomb went off underneath the car of a Notorious enforcer, shots were fired and a further unexploded device was found at the enforcer's home. A Hells Angels prospect was indicated.

The following day, 40 shots were fired into a house which had been owned by the enforcer's parents, on the NSW Central Coast.

The Mailonline has the full list of named Hells Angels NSW chapter full members and prospects, the details of 80 crimes and the club rules ascertained by Strike Force Raptor, which was charged specifically to target the Hells Angels.

The NSW Gangs Squad said the application to have the Hells Angels outlawed on the basis of the crimes catalogued above in the submission would be presented to the NSW Supreme Court at a date to be fixed.

The NSW Attorney General, Brad Hazzard, declined to comment on the matter.
