Police in the West Midlands have revealed their latest crack team of recruits, brought in to deal with the ever-growing threat of drugs and explosive devices.

The new crew - an adorable brood of puppies - will be trained to bring down some of Britain's toughest criminals by sniffing out danger ahead of officers.   

The seven-week-old Springer-Cocker Spaniel cross puppies, known as Sprockers, are the first to be born into the West Midlands Police's dog breeding programme, based in Balsall Common, Birmingham.

Crack team: The six cute puppies will be trained as sniffer dogs, helping police to foil some of Britain's most feared criminals

The three boys and three girls were born into the force's 'T-litter' on August 19 and are named Trev, Ted, Tyler, Topsey, Trotter and Turvey.

Officers are now looking for members of the public to adopt them until they are 12 months old.

After a year they will then be trained for eight weeks to become specialist search dogs or sniffer dogs - hunting out explosives and drugs. 

Yesterday, Dave Raymond, breed scheme manager at the force's dog unit, said: 'All the pups are doing really well - they're healthy and Olympia is a fantastic first-time mum.

'What we're trying to achieve in breeding Sprockers is to bring out certain temperaments in each of the breeds.

'Our Springer Spaniels tend to be a little bit gamey, meaning they like to chase birds, but the Cockers can be quite responsive so we're hoping we can create the ideal search dogs by combining the two.

'We've had Sprockers donated to us before and the ones we've got work very well and have a great nose on them.'

Puppy walkers are said to be vital to the training school as they help orientate the dogs for the next 12 months allowing them to experience living in a home, socialising with people and other animals.

Training: When they are one year old they will be trained for eight weeks to become specialist search dogs or sniffer dogs

Mr Raymond added: 'After their time with the puppy walkers, they'll go on an eight-week course to develop their search instincts. 

'They'll complete searches in buildings, streets, open spaces and vehicles with a view to becoming either a drugs sniffer dog or specialist search dog, depending on what they show an aptitude for.

'But for now, it's important they're just allowed to be pups and have fun developing in a happy environment, without any fears.

New colleagues: West Midlands Police officers proudly show off their latest canine recruits

'Anyone over 18, who would normally be at home during the day to look after the pups can apply.

'We're also looking for puppy walkers as we're quite low on numbers at the moment and could really do with some more volunteers.'
