The Pennsylvania woman who stabbed her former-basketball-star husband to death in his sleep is on trial and her attorney claims she is insane.

On Feb. 10, 2013, Maria Garcia-Pellon, 54, stabbed her husband of 25 years, Matthew White, with a kitchen knife as he slept. 

Garcia-Pellon has been charged with first- and third-degree murder as well as possession of an instrument of crime, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.  

Insanity: Maria Garcia-Pellon, 54, admitted to stabbing her husband, former basketball star, Matthew White in the neck while he slept and now her defense attorney is claiming she is insane

Claims: Between 2001 and 2013, Garcia-Pellon has claimed that terrorists and the mafia were targeting her, the government was spying on her, and the Chinese hacked her phone and internet and were controlling everything

She admitted to killing White and reportedly told police she had done so because she caught him watching pornography -- particularly child pornography. 

Investigators found no evidence of any kind of pornography on White's computer 

There is no doubt that she killed the former basketball star, who was the starting center for the University of Pennsylvania basketball team that reached the NCAA Final Four in 1979, according to ESPN.

The matter in question is her sanity.

The Huffington Post reports that after killing her husband, Garcia-Pellon changed her clothes and left their Nether Providence home. 

On Monday at her nonjury trial, Garcia-Pellon's family and friends recounted her unusual behavior leading up to the tragic incident. 

Her defense attorney, Thomas Bergstrom, took the Delaware County court judge on 'a trip through the depths of mental illness,' as he attempted to prove that Garcia-Pellon is guilty by reason of insanity or guilty but mentally ill.

Friends and family spoke at the trial and traced Garcia-Pellon's, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, paranoia, and schizoaffective disorder, mental illness back to 2001. 

Between 2001 and 2013, Garcia-Pellon has claimed that terrorists and the mafia were targeting her, the government was spying on her, and the Chinese hacked her phone and internet and were controlling everything, the Inquirer reports.

Basketball Star: White was the starting center for the University of Pennsylvania that reached the NCAA Final Four in 1979. He was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers  but ended up playing basketball in Europe

Bergstrom said, during the trial, that Garcia-Pellon first sought treatment in 2001 but began taking medication after she attempted suicide in 2007 and had to be hospitalized. He said the tragedy occurred after she stopped taking her medication.

Forensic psychiatrists for both the defense and the prosecution determined that Garcia-Pellon did suffer a mental disorder, but disagreed about whether the elementary school teacher was aware at the time that what she did was wrong. 

A police affidavit states that when she was being taken into custody, Garcia-Pellon said, 'I caught him looking at pornography, young girls. I love kids. I had to do it,' according to the Post.

White was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA but ended up playing basketball in Europe for 12 years where he met Garcia-Pellon.
