Swimmer: Before chairing meetings of world leaders, David Cameron stripped off to go swimming in Lough Erne

David Cameron dragged a reluctant police protection officer on an early morning swim in the freezing waters of Lough Erne.

The Prime Minister, a fan of so-called 'wild swimming', decided he fancied a dip just after dawn today.

'He joked with the police that they are supposed to give him "close protection" and so they had to come in, and one did,' said a Downing Street source.

The Prime Minister told colleagues that his swim, which took place just after 6am, had been 'early, brisk and cold'.

To the delight of Number Ten officials, Russian president Vladimir Putin, who normally delights in macho displays at international summits, apparently decided the Northern Irish waters were too chilly and stayed in bed.

Mr Cameron said as the summit ended: 'I can recommend a swim in the lough. That's what I did.

'I have the photographic evidence but I am not going to share it with you. It certainly wakes you up and gets you going for a hard day chairing this summit.'

The Prime Minister later tweeted that there had been 'no sign of the Russian President when I was swimming in a cold Lough Erne this morning, but his sporting prowess is clear'.

The waters of Lough Erne are currently around 14 degrees and the lake has also been overrun by zebra mussels, an invasive species which poses a hazard to the bare feet of swimmers.

However, Mr Cameron 'has a Labrador-like tendency to jump into water, no matter how cold', according to his biographer Francis Elliott.

He has said that ‘I spent all my early years swimming in Polzeath and I know what wonderful waters there are in Cornwall'.

More recently, the Prime Minister has spoken of swimming in the sea off his father-in-law Lord Astor’s estate on the Isle of Jura.

He also has a fondness for swimming in the lakes of Cumbria, particularly the notoriously chilly Ullswater.

'I have a guilty secret - every year since being prime minister I tell myself that I have to get to Cumbria and swim in one of the lakes. So far I have managed it,' he has said.

How many police officers does it take to secure a G8 summit? Not as many as the authorities thought, if the scenes around Enniskillen have been anything to go by.

With no disorder to deal with some of the 8,000 policemen and women deployed in this quiet corner of Northern Ireland have found innovative ways of keeping occupied.

A group on duty at one landmark had a competition to see who was the best bannister slider. Others have spent their breaks enjoying the welcome sun on the town’s riverbanks.

And mischievous local officers reportedly broke the ice with Yorkshire colleagues by driving past playing the theme tune to the TV soap Emmerdale.

The Prime Minister is patron of the Chipping Norton lido in his constituency, and once dived into the sea to save historian Andrew Roberts, a friend, from a school of dangerous jellyfish. Mr Roberts said it was a moment that showed the Prime Minister's 'great physical as well as moral courage'.

Mr Cameron was 29 and on holiday in Miramar, in the South of France, with his wife Samantha when they joined friends for a boat trip.

Also on board the vessel, which belonged to Daily Mail journalist Robert Hardman, was writer and socialite Petronella Wyatt, Andrew Roberts and his girlfriend, now his ex-wife.

Mr Roberts, then 33, insisted on swimming 100 yards from the boat to reach two local landmarks known as Les Deux Freres - 80ft tall volcanic monoliths.

'The sea was swarming with a horrible, menacing school of large jellyfish, one of which had stung me,' he added.

'It was frightening. They were transparent with a green tinge and had very long tentacles. There must have been 40 or 50 of them, so large that you would have struggled to squash one into a bucket.

'I yelped and squealed and waved desperately at the boat, but because of the rocks Robert couldn't bring it in to reach me.

'I knew that if I had to swim blind through the jellyfish, many of which were hiding under the surface, I would be repeatedly and badly stung. Things weren't looking good.'

Fortunately, Mr Cameron leapt from the boat. 'I realised he was coming to my rescue. He had goggles and had grabbed a spare pair for me. I still don't think it's something most people would have done,' Mr Roberts added.

'He swam within about 20 feet of me, through some of the jellyfish, to perform an Olympian throw. It was pretty impressive - it's not easy to throw any distance or with any accuracy when you're in water. He played cricket at Eton, I think, so that no doubt helped.

'I grabbed the goggles and then I could see where the jellyfish were, so I could navigate through them. Dave was doing the same.

'It seems funny now, but at the time I was terrified. The welt on my arm stung for about two days. If Dave hadn't rescued me and I'd been forced to swim through the jellyfish, I would probably have been hospitalised. It would certainly have ruined my holiday.

'I told him he was a hero, and I was serious. But he quite typically brushed it off. He's always downplayed it whenever I've mentioned it.'

* Perhaps it was David Cameron's attempt to show the G8 he wanted to call the tune. The Prime Minister adopted a musical theme for his personal gifts to the other leaders.

Among them was a USB stick featuring songs by lesser-known British acts, such as Jake Bugg, Alt-J and Lianne La Havas.

He also gave to each of them the best-selling album by a UK artist in their respective countries.Other gifts were designed to highlight Northern Irish brands, producers and artists.

They included a book of photography by local artist Chris Hill, bottles of 12-year County Antrim Old Bushmills Distillery reserve whiskey with a personalised G8 label, Co Couture chocolates from Belfast and handmade oak pens by County Down-based Tulip Woodcrafts.
