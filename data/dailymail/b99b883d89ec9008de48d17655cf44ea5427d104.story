It seems it's not just their advertisements which rub people the wrong way.

A 30-year-old swimmer claims she was barred from two Philadelphia, Pennsylvania public pools because security guards thought her tiny American Apparel bikini looked like underwear.

Lisa Conn said male employees 'harassed' and 'ridiculed' her when she showed up wearing a watermelon-print, ruched front tube top with skimpy yellow bottoms.

'I am flat-chested. My two-piece reveals 
nothing. I don't know if this is a bullying thing, a race thing, or 
humiliating women for the sake of it,' Conn opined.

'But I pay my taxes and I love my 
pool. I don't want any woman to be made to feel the way that I feel.'

Denied: Philadelphia barista Lisa Conn, 30, said two public pools denied her access because they claimed her American Apparel swimwear looked like underwear

What she was wearing: Lisa Conn said she was 'harassed' by male staff at two Philadelphia public pools for wearing this swimsuit from American Apparel

Conn, a barista, told Philly Mag she was rejected from a Hunting Park pool on Sunday because of her swimsuit.

'The large male security guard refused to let me swim,' she claimed. 'He said I could not get in wearing a 'bra and panties.' Those were his words. I insisted it was an American Apparel swimsuit.'

Conn claimed the guard then told a male lifeguard to check the tag on the inside of her bottoms.

Although she was eventually allowed to swim, she claimed a guard 'ridiculed' her in front of other swimmers.

'He told everyone that I was swimming in a bra and panties. I finally left, asking for his name, which he refused to give me. I came in smiling and happy and left on the verge of tears,' she said.

She said she called to complain but the pool's voice mail was full.

But her troubles didn't end there. Conn claims she was harassed at a different pool the next day. 

'There
 was a male supervisor present, and the scenario was almost identical,' 
she said. 'I was not allowed to swim at all. He also used the term 'bra and 
panties'.'

She said she called to complain about the supervisor on Tuesday, but workers said no-one with the name he gave her worked there. 

Customer service: After hearing about Lisa Conn's alleged ordeal, American Apparel contacted her through Twitter and offered her a range of free merchandise

Conn told Philly Mag some of her female friends have experienced similar issues.

Philadelphia Parks & Recreation aquatics coordinator, Lisa Whittle, described Conn's experience as 'unfortunate'.

She said swimmers are banned from wearing underwear at public pools, which would violate the Pennsylvania health code, before adding, 'We certainly don't want anyone to feel uncomfortable in our pools.'

Meanwhile, American Apparel reached out to Conn on Twitter yesterday, offering her a range of free merchandise for her troubles.

'Hey Lisa, glad we got in touch. Keep an eye out—you'll be swimming in AA gifts soon!' the company tweeted.
