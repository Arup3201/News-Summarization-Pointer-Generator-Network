Junkyard: Roy Harrison, 56, was fined after building up a pile of white goods in his suburban garden

A rag-and-bone trader who piled old fridges and ovens into his suburban garden has been fined after his Steptoe and Son-like hobby raised the hackles of council inspectors.

Roy Harrison, 56, cannibalised parts from the white goods to fix up other machines and sell them on - despite him being served with an enforcement notice five years earlier.

Harrison, who admitted being a 'lazy sod' for not storing the goods properly, has been made to pay £750 for failing to clear up the junk next to his £130,000 semi-detached home in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester.

Magistrates heard Harrison took parts from old washing machines, fridge freezers and microwave ovens to fix other electrical items.

He gained so many white goods that some neighbours complained to council inspectors, who served him with a planning enforcement notice in 2009.

Despite initially complying with the order, Harrison allowed the pile of junk to build up again and last year he again filled his front and rear gardens with washing machines and parts.

Stockport Magistrates' Court fined him £250 and made him pay £500 in costs after he admitted being in breach of an council enforcement notice.

Magistrates said it was a 'serious offence committed with no regard for his neighbours'. 

Stockport Council cabinet member Patrick McAuley said: 'Mr. Harrison in effect decided to use his house as a scrap yard with no regard whatsoever for his neighbours.

'He then compounded this by failing to comply with an enforcement notice served by the council.

'I welcome the strong message this conviction brings, as the council will take action where people breach planning controls to protect neighbours and the environment.'   

Harrison said after the case: 'It was my own fault and I'm sorry for what happened. I lost a shed I was using so I had to put these appliances somewhere.

Tip: Harrison said he would take the parts from the microwaves and fridge freezers to fix other white goods

'If I got two machines to take a part from one I would always keep the other one to,' Harrison said

'Fixing washing machines and fridges is my hobby. When I first started I had lost my job and where I was working I used to have a unit then it shut down so I had to move it and it all came here.

'If I got two machines to take a part from one and put it in the other I would always keep the other one too rather than throw it away, in case I needed another part.' 

'Being a lazy sod I just never got round to moving it again. I have paid for it now.'

He added: 'They said it looked like I was running a business but on the first occasion I was just learning how to repair them. If I got a decent washer it was something else to do in case I came out of work.

'My drive was covered in kitchen appliances at one point but it looked worse as they were due to be taken away by the scrap men the next day.

Scattered: Magistrates said the hobby was a 'serious offence committed with no regard for his neighbours'

'I'm not going to go back to doing this stuff here anymore. I have another place now, I'm not that stupid.'

Despite the complaints, some neighbours sprang to Harrison's defence. 

Steve Vicars said: 'Roy just fixes appliances. He has been doing it for as long as I've lived here and that's 16 years and it's never bothered me.

'Every once in a while he has a couple of washing machines and maybe a dryer but he fixes them and sells them on.

'It wasn't all over the place. He owns the house so I don't know why the council keep bothering him. 

'He's a sound bloke. He's very willing to help people. There's never a massive amount in the garden and it's shifted within a week. I got a machine off him and I've had it for three years with no problems. It's never a tip.'

Some neighbours defended Harrison, saying: 'I don't know why the council keep bothering him'

Comedy duo: Steptoe and Son, the fictional BBC pair who made a living spotting gems in other people's junk

Another neighbour said: 'Roy s a sound bloke and he does what he does, fixes machines and everyone on the estate has stuff off him.

'Everyone on the estate will vouch for him. It's his own house anyway so I don't see what the issue is. It seems the council cannot help but stick their noses into other people's affairs.'

A hit comedy for the BBC in the 1970s, Steptoe and Son focused on the lives of two rag-and-bone traders who scraped a living from spotting gems among other people's junk.

The father and son duo, who lived in west London, were constantly arguing, swore like troopers and sold their goods from a horse-drawn cart.
