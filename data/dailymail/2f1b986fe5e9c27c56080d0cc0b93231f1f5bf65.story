This Picasso drawing, valued at $1milion (£625,000) is being raffled off, with tickets costing less than £85

It is the first time a work by Pablo Picasso has been raffled, and will be done exclusively online.

It has been organised by the International Association to Save Tyre, a charity, and Sotheby's.

The artist's grandson, Olivier Picasso, and French journalist Péri Cochin came up with the idea of raffling the masterpiece.

Olivier
Picasso said: 'This is a very important drawing because it first stands
witness on the Cubist work carried out by my grandfather.'

He added: 'Everything innovative 
would interest him, I think that Pablo Picasso was a pioneer, pioneer in
his personal life, in his sentimental life, in his creation.

'He’s also a pioneer in all this forms of creations, painting, drawing, sculpture, ceramics, show, and I think he would have been amused to be involved in such an operation, a popular operation.'

London's Pavilion of Art and Design will house the work from today until October 20.

The drawing, which measures 30.5cm by 24cm, was bought by the charity from a gallery in New York, according to the Financial Times.

Ms Cochin said: 'I always helped this association because my mother is Lebanese and we were used to raising funds by making gala dinners where the guests had nothing to say, are bored and can’t wait to come back home quickly.

'We had tried to find an alternative to raise funds and we start this innovative adventure, an international lottery on a charity purpose with a chance to win a Pablo Picasso masterpiece.'

It has been authenticated by the Picasso Estate and the artist's children. 

The 5million euro proceeds will go towards development in the Phoenician city of Tyre, Lebanon.

Participants may purchase multiple tickets to increase their chances of winning the artwork.

The city is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the funds will go towards major socio-cultural projects in the area.

The draw for the signed work will take place at Sotheby's in Paris on 18 December and be broadcast online.

It will take place under the supervision of a court bailiff and be shown at www.1picasso100euros.com.

Thomas Bompard, director of the Impressionism and Modern Art Department at Sotheby’s France, said: 'Innovate to rescue, the equation wasn’t simple.

'Sotheby’s is very pleased to support such a noble and daring cultural project.

'I love the idea that a Picasso cubist drawing protects in a way five thousand-years-old antic stones located at the seaside of the Mediterranean.'

He added: 'It opens an auction house horizon.'

One of the most famous artists of all time, Pablo Picasso's art pieces have sold for tens of thousands of pounds.

Earlier this year, SAC Capital founder Steven Cohen paid $155million (£97million) for Le Reve, a portrait of Picasso’s mistress, Marie-Therese Walter.

Picasso's 1932 work Nude, Green Leaves And Bust, meanwhile, sold in May 2010 for $106.5million (£66million) in 2010.

Another of Picasso's masterpieces to sell for more than $100million was the Garcon A La Pipe. Created in 1905, it sold for $104million in 2004.
