Casey Anthony is to go back to school, but she will study on the internet because of safety fears.

The 25-year-old who is serving probation for cheque fraud will be educated from the comfort of her own home.

As a condition of her probation, which is unrelated to her acquittal of the murder of her daughter, Anthony is required to seek employment.

Back to school: Casey Anthony will study online during her one year probation

But because of death threats, she has been granted a waiver allowing her to attend school online instead.

It is not known what she will study.

Casey Anthony reported for probation in Florida on Wednesday evening, according to her lead defence counsel Jose Baez.

'America's most hated woman'
will serve probation 'somewhere in the state of Florida,' though the 
exact location of her probation office is being kept secret over 
concerns for her safety.

'She
reported,' Attorney Baez told Fox News. 'She told the officer she 
understands the conditions of her probation and she was told the date 
for her next appearance.'

A Florida appeals court had earlier ruled the
25-year-old must start a one-year probation sentence for cheque fraud 
by the end of this week.

A judge disagreed with her argument that enforcing a probation order would violate a constitutional block on double jeopardy.

Anthony claimed she completed the probation sentence in jail while awaiting trial over the 2008 death of her two-year-old daughter, Caylee.

But the ruling upheld a lower court’s order requiring Anthony to report to a Florida probation office no later than 12pm on Friday.

‘The petitioner and her attorneys were well aware that her probationary placement was not to begin until her release from confinement,’ it said.

A Florida jury last month acquitted Anthony of murder in the death of Caylee, in a case unrelated to the cheque fraud.

After
her release, she vanished from public view amid threats against her and
she has since kept a low profile - but is now back in Florida.

The probation order is from a sentence Judge Stan Strickland imposed in January 2010 after she pleaded guilty to stealing cheques from a friend.

Judge Strickland said at the time she should serve the probation upon her release, but those instructions were never put in a written order.

Corrections officials interpreted the sentence to mean Anthony could serve the probation while she was in jail.

But in an order this month, Judge Strickland clarified that she must begin her probation now that she is out of jail.

He then gave up the case and turned it over to Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over Anthony's murder trial.

Judge Perry upheld Judge Strickland's order, but Anthony's attorneys appealed last week to the Fifth District Court of Appeals in Daytona Beach.

In a court filing this week, Anthony’s legal team described the probation order as an ‘illegal sentence’.

The Florida Department of Corrections has determined that Anthony had already served the probation sentence.

Judge Strickland did not have jurisdiction to clarify the order because the probation sentence was terminated, the department said.

Earlier a DOC spokesman had told Fox News: ‘We're waiting for her.'
