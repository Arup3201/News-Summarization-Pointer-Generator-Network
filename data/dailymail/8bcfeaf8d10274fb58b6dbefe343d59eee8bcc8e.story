Gun incident: Police were called to San Francisco 49er Ray McDonald's house three months before his arrested on suspicion of domestic violence

McDonald, 29, was later arrested by 
San Jose Police on August 31. He was taken into custody and charged with
 domestic violence after officers were again called to the property.

The female victim was said to have 'visible injuries'. McDonald was later released on bail and has not been charged.

The
 police report of the first incident states that an engaged couple 'were 
in an argument when the female subject became upset, grabbed a firearm 
(handgun) registered to the male subject, and held it at her side.

'When
 the male subject informed the female subject that he was going to call 
911, the female subject put the firearm away and fled without incident.

'The female subject did not make any threats or point the firearm at the male subject.'

Police have not disclosed who made the 911 call.

Despite
 the incidents, McDonald, a defensive lineman, played in the 49er's first 
two games of the season, with tboth the team and the NFL saying they 
would wait for the results of the criminal investigation.

Speaking after the August incident McDonald told reporters: 'I can’t say too much, not right now, but the truth will come out.

'Everybody knows the kind of person that I am. I’m a good-hearted person.'

In 2010 McDonald was arrested in San Mateo County on suspicion of drunk driving. He was also arrested in 2012 on an outstanding warrant from that arrest.

He has been playing for San Francisco since he was drafted as a third round pick in 2007.
