The decomposing body of a man suspected of killing his pregnant girlfriend has been found hanging beside a suicide note admitting to the murder.

The remains of Boaz Johnson, 22, of Petersburg, Alaska, were discovered hanging from a tree in a remote forest in Kalapana, Hawaii on January 2, according to Big Island police.

He was the only person suspected in the murder of his girlfriend, 25-year-old Brittany-Jane Royal from Tustin, California, and of dumping her body in the ocean last May.

At a press conference on Tuesday, police revealed that they found a composition book near Johnson's body in which he confessed to murdering Royal after an argument.

Killed: The body of Boaz Johnson, right, has been found hanging from a tree in Hawaii next to a note admitting that he killed his pregnant girlfriend, Brittany Royal, left, last May and dumped her body in the ocean

'A composition book found near Boaz body contained three handwritten pages, Hawaii Police Department Assistant Chief Henry Tavares said, Big Island Video News reported.

'The writer ID'd himself as Boaz Johnson. He confessed to strangling Brittany while involved in a domestic dispute.'

Johnson also admitted throwing her body into the sea and indicated he planned to commit suicide, Tavarez said. He added that Johnson used the same type of rope to kill Brittany and himself.

Tavarez said that the note indicated Johnson killed himself just days after the murder, but the body was only found months later because it was hanging in a remote area surrounded by lava fields. It was less that two miles from where Brittany was killed.

Brittany's father, Ted, and maternal grandfather, Jerry Spahn, spoke at a press conference in Hilo on Tuesday to thank authorities and to reveal how they are coping with the loss of their beloved child. 

'I've been looking forward to this day for seven months,' her father began. 'The loss of Brittany is something that we are learning to live with, but throughout this time we've been blessed with support.

Heartbroken: Brittany's father, Ted Royal, struggled to hold back tears as he spoke at a press conference about the discovery on Tuesday. 'I've been looking forward to this day for seven months,' he said

Sadness: Her grandfather, Jerry Spahn, said a grandparent never expects to see their grandchild leave this world before them before reading a heartfelt statement from Brittany's mother, Julie

'One evil act will never outgrow the aloha spirit we’ve received and that Brittany so much loved.'

Her
 grandfather added: 'When we think back on when we raise our children, 
we don't ever think we'll see the day your granddaughter precedes you in
 leaving this world. But we have learned to endure that thought and she 
still is with us in thought.'

He
 also read from a statement provided by Brittany's grieving mother, 
Julie, who called the time since the murder, 'the most difficult seven 
months of our lives'.

'Losing
 Brittany to murder at the hands of another is life changing,' she said.
 'Life will go on and it will just be different, somehow, less than 
complete.'

She thanked 
people for their support, and said that due to a Facebook group set up 
to appeal for information, 'We know that a 25-year-old free spirit 
hippie girl could touch so many lives.'

She
 added: 'Brittany's life was about peace, love - we can all learn from 
her. She was searching for the perfect place to call home and to raise a
 child. She is now in that ultimate paradise. She is playing her guitar,
 singing sweet songs of meoldies, pure and true.'

Missed: Brittany's mother Julie, pictured with 
her daughter left and as a baby, said Brittany's life 'was about peace, 
love, we can all learn from her' in the statement delivered by Mr Spahn

Tragedy: Brittany was newly pregnant and looking forward to starting a yoga business when she was killed

A private forensic laboratory confirmed the body found in January was Johnson's through DNA and dental records.

Dead: DNA and dental records confirmed a decomposing body as belonging to Bo Johnson

According to an autopsy, Johnson's cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging and the manner of death was ruled a suicide.

A forensic document examiner also determined that the writing in the composition book matched Johnson's handwriting.

Tavares said that Johnson didn't express remorse for the murder in his note.

But 'he was very specific in what he did and in his intention to take his life,' he said.

Brittany's
 body was discovered by a fisherman on May 28 2013 in waters off 
Kalapana and an autopsy revealed she had died from strangulation.

She had moved to the island from 
California in January 2013 and met Johnson. Just months later they 
returned to her family home to break the news: they were expecting a 
baby.

They also announced their plans for the 
future; Brittany said she would work as a yoga instructor while Bo 
wanted to give lava tours.'She seemed finally ready to settle down,' her mother Julie Royal told People magazine last year.

But
 less than three weeks later, Bo failed to turn up to a meeting with a 
real estate agent and Brittany didn't call her mother to wish her a 
happy birthday.

Fight: Johnson wrote in his suicide note that he had strangled Brittany after they got into an argument

Ambitions: She told her family that she was hoping to teach yoga, while Johnson would conduct tours

Days later, a fisherman found her body in waters off the island. It
 was determined that Royal, who was 10 weeks pregnant, was strangled 
with rope, dragged across rocks and thrown into the ocean.

Relatives protested Johnson's innocence, insisting he had no money to escape or motive to kill
 her.

Police said he may have stayed in a local hostel two weeks 
after Brittany's death using a pseudonym.

According to ABC News, 
the manager of the hostel said she recognized his face from pictures but
 said he checked-in as Jeffrey Allen.

Johnson also allegedly told a friend in a 
telephone conversation that he and Royal were in good health after the 
woman's body had already been recovered.

The phone call, in addition to DNA and other evidence found at the crime scene, made Johnson an early suspect in Royal's murder.

Unanswered questions: Brittany's family became concerned when she failed to call her mother on her birthday, and her partner missed an appointment with a real estate agent

Bizarre: Last year, signs started appearing around the town saying that Bo was murdered on the lava fields amid racial tensions - strange discoveries that complicated the murder investigation

Authorities
 said the evidence showing Johnson was the killer was presented to a 
grand jury on December 18, and he was indicted for second-degree murder.

But
 because the indictment was sealed - to give authorities a chance to 
find him - it had not previously been reported. They were unaware at 
that point that Johnson was already dead.

In December, the families of Royal and the then-missing Johnson said they feared he too may have been murdered.

'We're
 definitely concerned that he was also murdered alongside Brittany. It's
 very possible her body showed up and his didn't,' Johnson's sister 
Sarah Johnson said before Christmas.

'It
 just seems all too easy to blame someone who isn't even here, may not 
even be alive to defend himself... He has a good heart. We were taught 
right from wrong.'

To further complicate the case, a news site received the anonymous 
letter claiming that Bo had been killed following racial tensions. 
The note listed specifics about the alleged murder.

Scene: Her body was found off the coast of Kalpana, Hawaii near to where the couple had been camping

The writer explained that Bo had 
intended to buy land at Kalapana and conduct lava tours without paying 
locals a cut of $1,000 a week.

'Haole
 had to be killed befor (sic) he buy land... said this message 2 haole, 
stay out of Puna - Puna is for the pono,' the note said.

In Hawaii, 'haole' is a term used for Caucasians and 'pono' is a Hawaiian word for righteousness.

Posters also began to emerge around the town, reading: 'You killed the baby! They killed Bo on the lava flow! Confess!'

'If
 he isn't the murderer, that means he's dead,' his sister said last 
year. 'So what do we have to look forward to. I keep praying that the 
police get their job done and they find this killer.'
