Man-made global warming is worsening and will disrupt both the natural world and human society, according to a joint report of two of the world's leading scientific organisations.

The U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society, which is the national scientific academy of the UK, have released an unusual plain language report on climate change that addressed 20 issues.

‘People do have persistent questions all about climate change,’ said study author Ben Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Lab in California. ‘This is a one-stop shop for many of those questions.’

If emissions continue
on their present trajectory, without
either technological or regulatory
abatement, then the best estimate
is that global average temperature
will warm a further 2.6 to 4.8 °C
(4.7 to 8.6 °F) by the end of the
century (right). The figure on left

aggressive emissions reductions

The Climate Change: Evidence and Causes report, released today, addresses new issues such as the recent slowing in the increase of world temperatures and how heat-trapping gases are connected to extreme weather.

It maintains there is unequivocal evidence that soaring levels of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are mainly the result of burning fossil fuels.

Carbon dioxide is now at its highest level for at least 800,000 years, and records dating back to the mid-19th century show a clear long-term warming trend.

Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, absorb heat energy and emit it in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth¿s surface and lower atmosphere warm

Human activities have increased CO2 concentrations by about 40 per cent, with more than half the increase occurring since 1970.

Since 1900, the global average surface temperature has risen by 0.8 °C (1.4 °F). This has been accompanied by warming of the ocean, a rise in sea level, a strong decline in Arctic sea ice.

Much of this warming has occurred in the last four decades as a result of greenhouse gases.

Continued emissions of these gases will cause further climate change, including substantial increases in global average surface temperature and important changes in regional climate.

Long-term climate change over many decadeswill depend mainly on the total amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases emitted as aresult of human activities.

One of the main clues to the origin of the CO2 is its atomic fingerprint, say the scientists. Measurements of different isotopes - or atomic ‘strains’ - of carbon show that most of the increase is human-generated.

On the other hand, there is much less certainty about the extent to which sea levels are likely to rise, and what effect increasing acidity of the oceans will have on marine life.

Increases in extreme weather, melting glaciers, rising seas and oceans getting more acidic are already happening, the 36-page report said.

As well as this, the report claims the chemical balance of the oceans has shifted toward a more acidic state, which makes it difficult for organisms such as corals and shellfish to form and maintain their shells.

As the oceans continue to absorb CO2, scientists believe their acidity will continue to increase over the next century, along with as yet undetermined impacts on marine ecosystems and the food chain.

There is no scientific proof of man-made global warming and a hotter earth would be ‘beneficial for humans and the majority of other species’.

The assertion was made by Canadian ecologist Patrick Moore, a member of Greenpeace from 1971 to 1986, to U.S lawmakers on Tuesday.

He told The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee: ‘If there were such a proof it would be written down for all to see.’

Moore pointed out that there was an Ice Age 45 0million years ago when CO2 was 10 times higher.

He said: ‘There is some correlation, but little evidence, to support a direct causal relationship between CO2 and global temperature through the millennia.

'The fact that we had both higher temperatures and an ice age at a time when CO2 emissions were 10 times higher than they are today fundamentally contradicts the certainty that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main cause of global warming.’

Even if the earth does warm up, Moore claims that it will be to the advantage of humans and other forms of life, as ‘humans are a tropical species’.

He said: ‘It is extremely likely that a warmer temperature than today’s would be far better than a cooler one.’

Humans, he added, just aren’t capable of predicting global temperature changes.

These changes ‘are expected to 
increase greater warming and will threaten food production, freshwater 
supplies, coastal infrastructure and especially the welfare of the huge 
population currently living in low-lying areas,’ it added.

The
 report said that while the rate of warming is slower in the 2000s than 
it was in the 1990s, it doesn't negate the 150 years of observations 
that show the world is warming.

It also said that more the 90 per cent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases lately has been absorbed into the oceans' deep water, which for a while slows surface warming but not the long-term trend.

Even if greenhouse gas emissions were to suddenly stop, it would take thousands of years for atmospheric CO2 to return to its levels before the industrial era.

A similar conclusion was last year reached by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), who said global warming is unequivocal and human influence has been the dominant cause.

The report highlighted a number of doomsday scenarios, including extreme storms, heat waves, rising sea levels and the melting of Greenland.

Among its findings, it said that sea levels have risen by 19cm since 1901 and are expected to rise a further 26-82cm by the end of the century.

However, it was unable to explain why world temperatures have barely risen in the past 15 years, despite growing amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere.

This slowdown has been seized upon by climate sceptics who claim carbon dioxide is not as damaging as has been suggested.

However, Sir Paul Nurse, president of the Royal Society, says there is enough evidence on the science to warrant action.

‘We've changed the chemical composition of the atmosphere; that's not a belief system,' Sir Santer said in an interview.

'We know that beyond shadow of a doubt. We ignore this at our peril.’
