Accused: Pregnant Marie McKinlay, 40, pictured arriving at court last week, is alleged to have run a high-class escort agency called Allure

A mother of two accused of running a ring of call girls through an online escort agency told a court: ‘My two favourite things in the world are money and sex.’

Marie McKinlay allegedly controlled a £500,000-a-year business employ-ing 25 women offering everything from ‘girlfriend experience’ to ‘porn star experience’.

The 40-year-old ex-escort and alleged brothel madam is said to have used the profits to put her daughters through private school and pay the £1,500-a-month rent on her four-bedroom home.

Asked why she had become an escort, McKinlay told Southwark Crown Court: ‘I’ve been asked this question many times and the way I answer it is, my two  favourite things in the world are money and sex, I absolutely love both of them, and a job that allows me to put them both together, why wouldn’t I?’

She said she had been able to meet ‘a class of gentlemen I’d never met before’ which included ‘wealthy people... not just wealthy people, people who worked in certain careers, like the City.

‘It opened me up to meeting a broader spectrum of people than I had met before. I had a couple of trips to Dubai, Paris, Geneva, staying in five star hotels, places that, had I not been doing this job, I could not afford to go to. I saw a different side of life. I saw a life I wanted to see.’

McKinlay, who denies controlling a prostitution ring, said she helped to form Agency Allure in 2002 as an escort business where ‘women were in control’ of what they did.

She said she and five other women decided to set it up at a meeting in Selfridges over a bottle of Chardonnay, and she ran it from December 2008 to May last year.

The prosecution claims clients were charged between £300 an hour and £1,500 for services from escorts employed by Allure, including 14-hour overnight bookings that ‘must include some sleep’.

McKinlay rented a £1,500-a-month apartment in central London where clients could meet escorts from a list including girls with names like ‘Beth Angel’ and ‘Sophie Sweetness’, the jury heard.

The court was told that some escorts 
who worked for McKinlay were known porn stars and the business was a 
front for a lucrative brothel which made her £350,000 in two and a half 
years and financed an ‘expensive lifestyle’.

McKinlay said she began working as a 
hostess in her mid-twenties at the Stork Club in Piccadilly following a 
stint as a wardrobe assistant in the West End.

She said she left the gentlemen’s club
 because she ‘got sick of the drinking’, telling jurors she ‘had to 
drink only champagne’ from 9pm to 2am every day.

She added that she then worked as an 
escort both independently and for a woman based in South Kensington 
before setting up Allure.

She said that by 2003 she was the only
 remaining founder member and, following the birth of her first child, 
had taken over running the administrative side. ‘When I realised I was 
pregnant I had to stop,’ she said. ‘I was already doing all the admin so
 we agreed that’s what I would keep doing.’

McKinlay, of Frome, Somerset, denies 
controlling prostitution for gain and converting criminal property 
between December 2008 and July 2011. The trial continues.
