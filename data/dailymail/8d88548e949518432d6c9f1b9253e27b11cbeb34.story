Discovery Channel have axed a true-crime series which exposed teachers who had sex with their students, following a backlash from educators.

'Bad' Teachers', a three-part series on Investigation Discovery, was cancelled after its Sunday debut when teachers unions complained the program was 'offensive' and misrepresented the profession.

Discovery Education's Steve Dembo announced the cancellation on his blog Tuesday, saying the company 'shared the concerns' of angry viewers.

'We appreciate the support of the educational community for bringing (their objections to the show) to our attention and we are pleased to share that Discovery Communications has decided to immediately cancel this program, removing it from ID's on-air and online schedule,' Dembo wrote.

Buckled under pressure: Discovery Communications has  cancelled true-crime series 'Bad Teacher' after its debut on Sunday  following complaints from members of the teachers unions

American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten welcomed the cancellation, saying she hoped teachers unions could work with Discovery Communications to 'showcase the real work teachers do every day'. 

'I was surprised to learn, through a barrage of tweets Sunday night after 'Bad Teacher' aired, that Discovery would use its brand to promote such an offensive program,' she said, according to Washington Examiner.

'However, I am heartened that it has taken steps to cancel the show and publicly affirm that Discovery Education's mission is to celebrate and support educators.

'Every day, educators go into the classroom to make a difference in the lives of our children. Their work should be honored and valued, not bashed.'

Observers noted the network may have feared that a union 
backlash would hurt sales educational 
products it provides to schools.
