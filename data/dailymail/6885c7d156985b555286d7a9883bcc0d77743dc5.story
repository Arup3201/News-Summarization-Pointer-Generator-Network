Free-to-air channels on Foxtel crashed on Wednesday afternoon, an outage which came in the middle of cricketer Phillip Hughes' funeral.

The outage caused all free to air channels to stop broadcasting, but the blackout was particularly bad for viewers watching the Hughes funeral on Channel Nine.

It cut out when Hughes' cousin Nino Ramunno was speaking and resumed broadcast around 20 minutes later.

A Foxtel spokesperson said they're yet to identify the reach of the outage but admitted it had a 'reasonably large impact'.

Foxtel users have expressed their outrage as the service went down in the middle of Phillip Hughes' funeral

'Some customers have been impacted by some severe storm activity at the satellite site', the spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

They added a failure of their back-up systems and the outage has not 'has not affected Foxtel Go and Foxtel Play.'

Many angry customers took to social media to express their outrage at the unfortunate timing of the error.

Foxtel had an error message up on their website confirming there is a signal outage, but asked people to wait until it is resolved rather than contacting them.

The outage was due to bad weather at their satellite station and Foxtel is yet to determine the reach of it

About an hour after the initial outage Foxtel tweeted that it was due to storm activity and a cable failure

'Please be advised that this is an issue at the signal source which has been escalated to our engineers and will be resolved as soon as possible. 

'This issue may impact some or all of your channels and will be resolved without you needing to speak to a technical agent or do anything,' a post from a community manager on the help page reads.

The same manager has also advised which other channels  viewers could watch Phillip Hughes' funeral on.

'If your viewing is affected on Channel 9 (FTA) by this issue, here is a list of alternatives to view Phillip Hughes funeral coverage: Fox Sports News SD - channel 254Sky News - channel 601Foxtel Go and Foxtel Play will not be affected (Sky News or Fox Sports News available),' the post read.

But this did little to calm those on social media upset by the outage.

Many took to social media to slam Foxtel over the inconvenient timing 

'Well done Foxtel at stuffing up the Hughes funeral for alot (sic) of people. No signal the entire time,' one user wrote.

Another posted a photo showing the error message on their TV screen, calling Foxtel a 'disgrace'. 

After the channels had been down for around an hour Foxtel tweeted their apologies that some customers' services were down due to 'storm activity and cable failure'. 

'We apologise that some customers may be impacted by storm activity and a cable failure. The issue will be fixed ASAP'.
