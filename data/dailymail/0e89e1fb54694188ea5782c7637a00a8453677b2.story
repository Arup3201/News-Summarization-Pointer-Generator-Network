A woman who was arrested for 'suffocating a newborn baby boy when she lay on him' is thought to be the child's grandmother. 

Officers were called to Lychgate Court in Oldham, Greater Manchester, after paramedics found the three-week-old infant 'unresponsive'.

The suspect, 55, is now being questioned by detectives on suspicion of causing death to a child by overlaying, police have said. 

Police were called to Lychgate Court in Oldham, Greater Manchester where they found the three-week-old baby unresponsive. A woman is now being questioned by police 

Overlaying is a term used when a baby is suspected to have suffocated when somebody lies on them while in bed. 

The infant was taken to Royal Oldham Hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later.

Detective inspector Dave Moores, said: 'This is an absolutely tragic case in which a baby who is barely three weeks old has died.

'Any death of a baby is always extremely upsetting and keenly felt by family members and even the wider community.

'An investigation is under way and we are committed to identifying how and why this baby died. We also have officers supporting family members at what is clearly a very distressing time for them.'

The arrested woman, who is understood to be related to the child, remains in custody.
