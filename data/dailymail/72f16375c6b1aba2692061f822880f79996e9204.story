Pilot Aaron Regan said that police and paramedics were already at the scene when the helicopter arrived.

'It wasn't a nice incident to go to and obviously one of them has lost their lives,' he told the ABC.

'Hopefully the other seven recover.'

There have also been reports the accident happened when several four-wheel-drive vehicles were following each other as part of a tour. 

Five other passengers were taken to the Gympie Hospital with varying injuries.

Police have not confirmed reports the deceased person is a British tourist.
