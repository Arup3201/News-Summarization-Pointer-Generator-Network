Runaway teacher Jeremy Forrest had sex with his schoolgirl lover up to eight times a night, a court heard yesterday.

The married 30-year-old had a four-month affair with his pupil before she persuaded him to flee to France with her amid fears she might kill herself.

Before they absconded the maths master seduced the 15-year-old in his car while she was wearing her school uniform, Lewes Crown Court was told.

Jeremy Forrest, pictured arriving at court today, asked the schoolgirl to return home and was in tears as they drove to France, the girl said

Forrest had also sent her ‘graphic’ and cringe-making text messages, it was claimed.

During a police interview played to 
the court, a friend of the girl said the teenager had told her she had 
slept with Forrest in his car, home and at hotels, often without 
contraception.

‘She said they had sex multiple times in one night. It was seven or eight times,’ said the girl.

The friend said the teenager was 
often wearing her school  uniform –which consisted of a  navy polo, knee
 length black skirt, black tights and black Vans shoes – during the 
encounters as Forrest used to meet her straight after class.

The friend said that at the start of
 the relationship Forrest sent compliments to the girl such as ‘You’re 
beautiful’. As it progressed the messages became more explicit, she 
said. ‘There were some sexual ones, they were quite graphic things, it’s
 really like cringey stuff.

‘I think she kind of liked it, so she did play along with it, she said the same sort of things back to him.

‘I do not remember exactly what she said but she said, “Imagine  me 
doing this to you” or something like that.’

The couple spent eight days 
on the run before Forrest was arrested with her in Bordeaux last 
September. He has denied a charge of child abduction.

The couple, who have not met since 
they were found, smiled at each other across the courtroom yesterday as 
the teenager, now 16, took to the witness box, having declined an offer 
to give evidence via video link.

She told the jury that before the pair fled she had felt suicidal, fearing their relationship was about to be exposed.

A day earlier police had confiscated 
her phone after being tipped off as rumours of the relationship swirled 
around Bishop Bell C of E School in Eastbourne, East Sussex.

The girl, who cannot be named for 
legal reasons, said Forrest tried to ‘persuade me not to run away’ and 
only came with her because she was ‘insistent’ and he feared for her 
safety.

The girl said that as Forrest drove her to Dover to board a 
cross-channel ferry to Calais he seemed ‘very worried and very 
emotional’.

She said: ‘I don’t think he wanted to take me anywhere. I was insistent.

‘I was very determined and once I had
 an idea in my head nobody was going to stop me, not Jeremy, not 
anybody. I was adamant we had to go otherwise I feared what would 
happen.’

Forrest was aware she had suffered from an eating disorder, self-harming and was having problems at home, the court heard.

The teenager said: ‘He was concerned 
that if I went on my own I would be in danger so he said it would be a 
better idea if he came with me.

‘I was very pleased. If Jeremy said he was not coming with me I dread to think what situation I would be in then.

‘He said to me, “this isn’t going to 
end very well but if you are insisting things could happen to you as a 
result we have to go”.’

Under cross examination by defence counsel Ronald Jaffa, the girl admitted she had felt suicidal at the time.

She said: ‘It was one of those times I
 was feeling very low indeed and I was very desperate. And when I’m 
desperate those are the kind of things I do.’

The teenager said that after they fled, Forrest repeatedly  asked her to return home but she refused.

She added: ‘He was saying “I can’t go back”. He was now stuck in the position.’

The girl told the court she had 
‘instigated’ the relationship with Forrest, which began following a 
school trip to Los Angeles the previous February.

Forrest had comforted her after learning of her personal problems.

The girl said her mother, who was 
pregnant with her fifth child at the time and had just left her  
stepfather, did not believe she had a problem.

As she left the court the teenager smiled again at Forrest who rested his head on the front of the dock.

The case continues.
