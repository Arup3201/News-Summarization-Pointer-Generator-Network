Reindeer carpaccio is to feature among the luxury delicacies being offered by budget supermarket Lidl this Christmas.

Packs of the thinly sliced raw meat will feature in the ‘Deluxe’ range that the thriving German chain hopes will draw in shoppers who would normally go to the other major retailers.

Although the meat is mainly considered a Scandinavian delicacy, Lidl has had some success selling reindeer steaks in Britain, and believes consumers are now ready to eat the meat in its raw form.

Budget supermarket Lidl are to offer reindeer carpaccio as part of their luxury 'Deluxe' range this Christmas 

Carpaccio is an Italian delicacy which traditionally consists of raw meat or fish that has been sliced very thinly. 

Lidl’s reindeer version is smoked and costs £4.99 a pack.

Lidl has already had some success in selling reindeer meat in its stores 

It is one of 59 products being added to the budget chain’s upmarket range, taking the total number of luxury goods to 224.

The list also includes whole serrano hams at £39.99, gingerbread houses at £4.49, a whole lobster for £5.99, scallops at £3.99, champagne at £11.99 and Rioja Riserva at £5.99.

Lidl has faced criticism for selling reindeer meat in the past. 

Animal welfare campaigning group Viva claims that the wild predators of reindeer, such as wolves and bears, are shot to protect meat supplies for retailers.

Lidl insists that its reindeer meat is sourced only from producers who abide by EU animal welfare standards.

Ronny Gottschlich, Lidl UK’s managing director, said: ‘We’ve sourced some of the finest foods from across Europe to complement our fresh, local produce, so everyone can make the most of this special time of year, regardless of budget.’  

The company’s most recent TV advertising has featured a street market apparently offering artisan foods to shoppers who are surprised to be told the products actually come from Lidl.

The Christmas commercial follows this theme and features people being treated to a festive feast on reindeer carpaccio, lobster, turkey and stollen in a Hertfordshire mansion. 

It captures their stunned reaction to learn it all came from Lidl.

The guests’ genuine reactions of surprise are then captured when it is revealed that the feast was a Christmas gift from Lidl.
