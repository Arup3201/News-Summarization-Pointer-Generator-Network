This is the female New England Patriots fan who was punched in the face by a New York Jets supporter at a football game.

Jaclyn Nugent was struck by convicted killer Kurt Pashcke in a brutal attack following his team's last-minute win on Sunday night. Pashcke has been become a national hate figure after video of the attack appeared on the internet.

New Jersey State Police charged four people on Tuesday - including Nugent. Her fellow Patriots fans Amanda MacDowell and David James Sacco also face charges along with Paschke.

Police have reviewed the fight and found that both MacDowell and Nugent were first observed kicking and punching Paschke.

Soon afterwards, Paschke punches Nugent in the face. Sacco then struck Paschke in the face.

The four fans have been charged with simple assault and disorderly conduct. They are scheduled to appear at East Rutherford Municipal Court.

MailOnline can now reveal Nugent is a 26-year-old graduate from the University of Massachusetts, with a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice and Corrections.

going to be charged, she replied: 'I really don't know as this stage.'

It's unclear what started the brawl, but a new rule that helped the Jets clinch the victory may have had something to do with it.

According to Newsday, the new rule stipulates that a player may not push a teammate into the opponent's formation.

The rule was brought to bear when Patriot Chris Jones pushed his teammate Will Svitek forward in an attempt to block the kick.  

After Jones was penalized, the Jets got 15 yards closer and Nick Folk made a 42-yeard game-winning kick

A Jets team spokesperson released a statement saying, 'We are aware of the situation, and we do not tolerate that behavior. Parties involved were detained, and this matter is now in the hands of the New Jersey State Police.'

The New York Daily News spoke to Paschke's mother, who says her son punched Nugent to protect her.

Colleen Paschke was at the game with her son and daughter on Sunday, in which the Jets bested the Patriots 30-27.

'He’s the victim, really,' she told the New York Daily News from her home. 'He was just concerned for his mother and himself.'

Colleen Paschke says that from the beginning of the game she and her children were heckled by a group of Patriots fans.

Those same fans, of whom Nugent was one, allegedly set upon the Paschkes as they were leaving the stadium.

'He was just hitting back to defend himself,' she said. 'It wasn't done deliberately. If you see the video, they just went wild.'

Colleen Paschke told the Daily News that when Nugent left, she flicked blood - blood drawn by Kurt Paschke - at her.

According to the New York Post, Paschke was originally charged with murder but was convicted of the lesser crime.

'I am deeply sorry,' Paschke said at the time of his sentencing in 1995. 'I can honestly say I never sought the confrontation, but when it came, I did what I had to do.'

The father of the deceased told the New York Post that Paschke 'got off lightly' for the stabbing of his son because Paschke's father was a Suffolk County police officer.

'I wrote the judge a letter, that this guy is going to kill again,' Robert Ferrer, 80, told the New York Post.

'He killed for no reason. He went out of his way to get a knife to stab my son. My son was involved in a fist fight and he went out to get a knife and stabbed my son. They were the same age. They were the same size. He had no business killing my son.'
