Downton Abbey's beloved Carson has swapped his butler's uniform for a Father Christmas costume in a bid to raise awareness of global warming.

Actor Jim Carter donned a fluffy beard and red robes to appear in a special Greenpeace film titled An Urgent Message From Santa.

The 65-year-old urges viewers that Christmas could be cancelled unless world leaders take more action to protect the melting Arctic.

The actor who is married to fellow actress Imelda Staunton said: 'My wife and I have been Greenpeace members and supporters for the past 25 years and I couldn't say no when they asked me.'

'This is a chance to do something positive for the Arctic, which is a 
precious resource. I hope that people will be prompted by this graphic 
little film, get behind it, sign the petition and get more involved.'

Carter who has also appeared in films such as Alice in Wonderland and Shakespeare in Love added: 'This is a very different version of Santa from the traditional, jolly, red-faced chap - this is a Santa on his last legs.

'I've never been a Father Christmas before, with the wig and the beard, because my voice would give me away.Â 

The 65-year-old actor warned viewers that Christmas could be cancelled unless world leaders did more to protect Santa's home in the Arctic

'I want to do my part to help raise the profile of the threats posed to the Arctic by oil drilling and climate change.

'So I was pleased to have this opportunity to support Greenpeace and their amazing Christmas campaign.'

The film ends with Carter in character as Santa asking for help to save his home in the North Pole, otherwise children worldwide will be left with empty stockings.

It is part of the environmental organisation's Save The Arctic campaign, which counts Sir Paul McCartney, Jude Law, Madonna and designer Vivienne Westwood among its supporters.

'I hope this can stimulate people thinking about that and putting political pressure on our leaders. Nobody wants to see the Arctic melt,' Carter added.

John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: 'Everyone loves Santa and nobody wants him to lose his home.

'If enough people support our campaign to protect the Arctic, then the younger generation will be able to sleep well on Christmas Eve, safe in the knowledge that Santa's home will be saved.'
