Dispute: The row centred on garlic from China 

Britain has been forced to hand over £15 million to the European Union to settle a bizarre dispute over garlic.

Brussels demanded the sum because it ruled that the UK did not charge enough duty on shipments of garlic from China.

Judges at Europe’s top court said the British taxman should have classed the imported garlic as fresh rather than frozen, and so charged a higher tariff.

Last night critics mockingly dubbed the charge a Dracula Tax, because of garlic’s fabled anti-vampire powers, and said the case illustrated the power of EU institutions and the way they increasingly get the better of Britain.

Just last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed that the European Commission is taking the Government to court to make it easier for migrants to get benefits by scrapping restrictions on who can claim child benefit and tax credits.

Judges at the Luxembourg court have also overruled Britain’s objections to a cap on bankers’ bonuses, in what is seen as a damaging blow to the City.

Tory Sir Bill Cash, a leading Eurosceptic MP who chairs the European Scrutiny Committee, said last night: ‘This £15 million is a lot of money by any standards, but what I call the Dracula Tax is just yet another example of what is now becoming an endemic problem.

‘We are increasingly losing cases in the court – it’s a natural consequence us our being boxed into a European legal framework that is not dependent on policy. I think this case is petty but it also highlights what we are up against.’

He believes Parliament needs to pass a new law that would enable Ministers to bypass the demands of the European court as well as human rights legislation.

The garlic case took almost a decade to be resolved. It began when the European Anti-Fraud Office inspected ‘imports of fresh garlic originating in China’ and concluded that the authorities in Britain had made ‘obvious administrative errors’.

Investigators claimed Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) staff had not been checking whether the garlic coming into Britain was fresh or frozen, and simply charged the lower rate of duty applied to frozen vegetables when the cargo was fresh. 

Eventually the European Commission told the UK to pay it just over £20 million for underpayment of duty on imports of garlic between January 2005 and December 2006.

Britain refused to pay up, claiming there was nothing owed, and was taken to court.

The dispute came after Britain did not know whether it was paying for frozen or fresh imported garlic

HMRC said it originally believed the garlic, which was stored at -3C, counted as completely frozen but later scientific evidence suggested otherwise. 

The agreements with the Chinese food companies concerned could not be changed retrospectively, so the extra duty could not be collected later.

HMRC has now paid £15 million as it was allowed to keep a quarter of the bill to cover the costs of collection.

A spokesman for HMRC said last night: ‘We were naturally disappointed with the judgment.

‘The Commission’s case relied heavily on facts regarding the freezing point of garlic which came to light subsequently and which we did not know at the time the classification rulings were issued.’
