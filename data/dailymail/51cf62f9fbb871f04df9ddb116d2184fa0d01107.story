Scott Turnbull said busy lifestyles mean people are forgetting to collect ashes

The remains of dead Australians dating back more than half a century are lying unclaimed on the shelves of funeral homes and crematoriums because people are 'too busy' to collect them.

In one case, a family-owned funeral home in Tasmania has more than 200 boxed remains collecting dust on its shelves, and its company director is squaring the blame on people's modern lifestyles.

Scott Turnbull from Turnbull Family Funerals said people's 'fast-paced lifestyles' are making them forget to claim their loved one's ashes.

'I think from our perspective most of the reasoning (people forget) is that we live in a fast-paced world and people don't take five minutes for anything,' he said.

'Everyone is too busy and they put things in front of them, and forget others.'

The oldest ashes of a person he has date back to the 1950s, and because he was never instructed how to dispose of the remains with dignity, he feels obliged to keep them.

It's creating a moral dilemma for directors of funeral homes more generally who are hoarding unclaimed urns and are unsure of what to do with them.

Mr Turnbull said laws in Tasmania require funeral homes to hold on to ashes for two years, at which time they can choose how to dispose of them.

He said family members can collect ashes 'days within the cremation' and if they are not collected straight away the funeral home usually gives people up to a year before making contact.

'We give next of kins and families the time they need to collect them,' he said, which could be anywhere from six to 12 months.

'We must show that we have made reasonable attempts to contact the family and it is then up to the individual funeral home, crematorium or cemetery how they want to dispose of them.'

But Mr Turnbull said out of dignity for the deceased, he usually holds onto them and in some cases people do eventually remember.

'Last year there was a lady ... who came back for her son's ashes and he died in 1969,' Mr Turnbull said.

'The lady who had made the inquiry was making a general inquiry and she didn't think for one moment he might still be here.'

He said people should not allow busy schedules and lifestyles to cloud their memories and family members need to talk about wishes after they die.

Mr Turnbull said some of the the most elaborate send offs are often the best. 'We have had some amazing things done,' he said.

'One person asked to be frozen into a block of ice and dropped into the water so that  as it melt the ashes drifted in to the sea.'
