A mother has told how social workers turned up while she  was giving birth in hospital to say they would be taking her baby  into care.

Without consulting her, social services chiefs had decided Kelly McWilliams was unfit to look after her baby because she had suffered from depression five years earlier after her ten-year-old son was found hanged.

The officials arrived without warning to say the baby would go straight into foster care as they were concerned about Mrs McWilliams’s mental health.

Kelly McWilliams is demanding an apology from Doncaster Social Services after her daughter Victoria, now 18 months, was taken into foster care after her birth 

But the baby, a girl named Victoria, had serious breathing problems and was transferred to intensive care.

Mrs McWilliams, 36, said she was only allowed to spend two hours a day with her daughter, supervised by a social worker.

She was forced to call a lawyer from hospital and ended up in court two days after the birth to plead her case.

Victoria’s father, who lived apart 
from Mrs McWilliams, was given temporary custody of the baby when 
Victoria was discharged from hospital ten days after her birth, and for 
four months Mrs McWilliams was only allowed two hours of supervised time
each day with her child.

Miss McWilliams has since been reunited with Victoria

Last night, the mother of five from 
Doncaster said: ‘I feel very, very angry and very, very let down because
I had overcome my mental health problems and was in a very good place 
and I was feeling proud and ready to be a mother.

‘Then this came along and crushed me. I lost precious time with my daughter. I missed her first smile, I missed so much.’

The social workers were able to take 
Victoria into care after obtaining an emergency protection order from 
Doncaster Magistrates’ Court.

Mrs McWilliams said: ‘They literally 
just walked in very coldly and said as soon as I had delivered my baby 
she was going to get placed into foster care.

‘I was in labour when they came in. To be honest I didn’t actually believe them, at first I thought it was some kind of joke.’

When she asked why Victoria had to be fostered, she said they replied: ‘Because you are not well.’

According to Mrs McWilliams’s lawyer,
Doncaster social services had gone too far when Victoria was born in 
August 2011, having failed to carry out a pre-birth assessment or case 
conference to discuss any possible intervention.

Solicitor Sarah Young said that if proper procedures had been followed, social services may not have needed to take action.

Miss Young added: ‘I think it’s a shocking example of a massive over-reaction by social services in Doncaster.’

Victoria is now 18 months old and 
happily living with her mother. But Mrs McWilliams is demanding an 
apology from Doncaster social services, which she fears has not learned 
from its mistakes.

Miss McWilliams was in labour at Doncaster Royal Infirmary with her daughter Victoria when social workers arrived to take her unborn daughter away

Her case follows a series of major 
failings by care bosses. In November, an Ofsted inspection found that 
children’s care in Doncaster was still ‘inadequate’.

The service had already been 
criticised over the deaths of seven children and failures that led to 
the torture of two boys by two brothers who were in foster care.

Mrs McWilliams said: ‘People need to 
know what Doncaster social services are like, because they make mistake 
after mistake but they are not paying for it.

‘To me, they have got more power than the police, they can do what they want when they want.

‘Nobody can make up for what they have
taken away from me. They need to change the way they work. It can’t 
happen to anyone else. I was an experienced mum and yet I had to be 
supervised all the time I was caring for Victoria.

‘I am constantly terrified that there will be a knock on the door and that someone will come to take Victoria away from me.’

Chris Pratt, director of Doncaster’s 
Children and Young People’s Services, said: ‘It’s inappropriate for us 
to comment on cases involving individual children. However, when any 
matter of concern is raised with me I do ask for this to be examined and
I have done that in this case.’
