Children from every state secondary school will travel to the First World War battlefields as part of a £50million package of events to mark the centenary of the Great War.

David Cameron yesterday pledged a ‘truly national commemoration’  in 2014 to remember the start of the ‘war to end all wars’.

The Prime Minister said Britain had a duty to ‘honour those who served, remember those who died and ensure the lessons learnt live with us forever’.

David Cameron said a speech at the Imperial War Museum today that the First World War's place in the national consciousness meant it had to be commemorated properly

He added that it would be a 
‘monumental mistake’ to forget the sacrifice and lessons of the 
conflict, which left almost a million British soldiers dead.

In a £5.3million project, two ‘student
ambassadors’ and a teacher from  every state secondary school will be 
offered the chance to visit the great  battlefields, such as the Somme, 
Verdun and Fromelles, and take part in remembrance ceremonies on the 
Western Front.

The trips will start in spring 2014 and run until March 
2019.

National commemorations of the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War are likely to centre on the Cenotaph in central London, where Remembrance Sunday is marked each year

David Cameron unveiled a four-year £50million programme to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of the start of the First World War. It includes:

At the Imperial War Museum in London 
yesterday, Mr Cameron said it  was vital to mark the war because of the 
‘sheer scale of the sacrifice’.

‘This was the extraordinary sacrifice 
of a generation,’ he added. ‘It was a sacrifice they made for us, and it
is right we remember them.’

The war had also helped ‘make us who 
we are today’, he said, pointing  to subsequent advances in the 
emancipation of women, recognition for ethnic minorities and 
improvements in medicine.

The Prime Minister, who revealed his 
favourite book is Robert Graves’s war memoir Goodbye to All That, added:
‘There is something about the First World  War that makes it a 
fundamental part of our national consciousness.

‘Put simply, this matters – not just 
in our heads, but in our hearts. It has an emotional connection. I feel 
it very deeply.’ Defence Minister Andrew Murrison, a former naval 
doctor, acknowledged that while the conflict remained a controversial 
event, it was right to remember those who had died.

‘The commemorations will be very much 
focused on remembrance, making no judgment on right or wrong or 
indulging in jingoistic sentiment,’ he added.

‘The fact is it happened, millions of people died and the consequences are still with us today.’

Chris Simpkins, of the Royal British 
Legion, said: ‘The tragic events of 1914-1918 have left a deep imprint 
on the fabric of the nation.

More than a million Britons died in the First World War. The Battle of the Somme was one of the most deadly in the four year conflict. Here a party of Royal Irish Rifles is pictured in a communication trench on the first day of the Battle of the Somme

Personal accounts of life on the frontline are likely to feature heavily in the commemorations, most notably from the Battle of the Somme, the bloodiest day in the history of the British army

‘The losses were felt in nearly every 
town and village across the UK, as demonstrated by the monuments found 
in every village green or churchyard.

‘It is right and proper the centenary has a strong local flavour.’

Mr Cameron added to his growing 
historical blunders yesterday when he declared that 200,000 British 
soldiers were killed during a single day of the Battle of the Somme – 
ten times the true figure.

On the battle’s opening day, July 1, 
1916, the British Army suffered the worst losses in its history, with 
40,000 wounded and 20,000 killed.

It comes after Mr Cameron wrongly 
identified the composer of Rule Britannia and was unable to translate 
the meaning of Magna Carta during an appearance on the David Letterman 
show last month.

Senior politicians from all parties marked the death of Harry Patch, the last surviving British soldier to have fought in the trenches on the Western Front. His funeral in 2009 was held at Wells Cathedral

Commemorations marking the centenary of  the First World War will last five years and cost £50million. They will include:

£5.3million to allow children and teachers from every secondary school to visit battlefields such as the Somme, Verdun and Fromelles.

National commemorations on August 4, 2014, to recall the first day of the conflict; on July 1, 2016,to remember the first day of the Somme; and in 2018 to mark the centenary of Armistice Day.

£15million in grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund to support events across the country. Ideas include friendly football matches to mark the 1914 Christmas Day truce on the Western Front.

A £5million contribution to the £35million  redevelopment of the Imperial War Museum’s First World War galleries.

A £1million grant to secure the future in Belfast of HMS Caroline, WW1’s last surviving warship.
