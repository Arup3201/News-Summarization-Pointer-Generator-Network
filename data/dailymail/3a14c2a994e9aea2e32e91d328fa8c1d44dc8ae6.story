Chelsea star Cesc Fabregas is enjoying some time away from the cold British weather as he relaxes on a Caribbean island with his girlfriend Daniella Semaan. 

With the Blues flying high at the top of the Premier League, Jose Mourinho has allowed his players a short break away from west London, with Spaniard Fabregas opting to whisk his partner to Saint Barthelemy.

The pair frolicked in the sea, before basking in 30 degree heat on the French island... a far cry from the wind and rain of the English capital.

Fabregas has been a mainstay in the Chelsea side this season, featuring in 27 matches already

Mourinho's side have won 15 of their first 21 Premier League games, losing just two in the process. After a disappointing defeat by Tottenham, the Blues returned to winning ways last weekend, brushing Newcastle aside at Stamford Bridge.

The 5-3 loss to Spurs on New Year's Day was a shock to the Chelsea system, but Fabregas insists that they did not get complacent ahead of the game.

'There is never complacency at Chelsea, we just want to win every game,' Fabregas told the Evening Standard. 'Of course that's not possible through the season, there are many, many games.

'Losing to Tottenham like we did was a shock, but when you watch the game again you see that every chance they had, they scored.

'It was one of those days where we hit the post, Ramires and Cesar Azpilicueta also had a chance. Things didn't go our way, but credit to Tottenham, they played a good game. But that's it, we are just looking to move forward now.'

Mourinho's side played four matches in just 11 days over the Christmas period, and Fabregas, as a mainstay in this season's Chelsea line-up, was one of a number of players given some time off. 

John Terry and Eden Hazard are away from west London too, while Nemanja Matic, Branislav Ivanovic, Willian and Diego Costa were all dropped to the bench for Chelsea's FA Cup tie against Watford to enable them to recharge their batteries.

Chelsea are just two points ahead of reigning champions Manchester City in the Premier League, whom they face on January 31.

On Saturday, Fabregas and his Blues team-mates will make the trip to south Wales, where they face a mid-table Swansea side without a win since Boxing Day. 

Mourinho will surely be hoping that a refreshed and recharged Fabregas can help his team to all three points at the Liberty Stadium.
