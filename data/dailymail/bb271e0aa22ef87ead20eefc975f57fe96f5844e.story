Arsene Wenger has addressed Arsenal's defensive frailties this season by signing Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista for an initial fee of £11.2million.

The Brazilian centre-back had helped  Villarreal towards the second best defensive record in La Liga  and will be a welcome addition at the Emirates where the Gunners' backline has been depleted by injuries this term.

The 24-year-old has already been granted a UK work permit and is expected to complete his move on Monday, but who is Paulista and is he the answer to Arsenal's defensive woes?

Arsenal’s new signing Gabriel or Paulista?

Gabriel to Villarreal fans. And that’s likely to be his footballing name in London too.

How long has he been in Europe?

He signed for Villarreal in the summer of 2013 from Brazilian side Vitoria. Villarreal were debating between signing Barcelona central defender Marc Bartra and 22-year-old Gabriel and they opted for the boy from Brazil.

And they chose well?

He was a reliable reserve at first but injuries to first choice centre-backs Mateo Musacchio and Victor Ruiz gave him his chance and he took it. 

This season he had been near ever-present and a consistent performer in the team with the second best defensive record in the division. It’s fair to say, however, that the jump from Spain to the Premier League will be even more testing than the one from Brazil to La Liga.

Where might he be found wanting?

He’s less than two years out of Brazil and still a little raw. Arsene Wenger is buying huge potential but not the finished article. 

Learning your trade in Brazil and then playing in La Liga might also not serve as the greatest apprenticeship for the Premier League where many of the teams he faces will be far more direct than he has been used to. But he is 6ft 1in and competent in the air and it’s also true that he bring a lot of other strengths to the table.

Arsene Wenger will be pleased that the  24-year-old has an impressive fitness record

And they are?

He will give the team excellent distribution out of defence. Displays confidence and maturity on the ball. He is also quick, strong and aggressive. 

And, perhaps of extra importance to Arsenal in view of their record – Gabriel’s fitness record is very good – barely missed a game since arriving from Brazil.

And he’ll be missed at El Madrigal?

They have reasonable back-up in Musacchio and Ruiz and will buy before the window shuts but yes Gabriel had emerged as the best of the three central defenders at the club this season. 

They are used to seeing their best players leave and Joel Campbell’s arrival softens the blow but coach Marcelino admitted it was ‘inopportune’.

Paulista was brought to tears as he said his final goodbyes to fans at El Madrigal

From his tears it looks as if Gabriel will miss Villarreal

He was very settled on Spain’s east coast. The move was also something of a surprise. But we’ve seen goodbye tears from Alberto Moreno before joining Liverpool and a watery eye from Adrian when he left Betis to join West Ham. 

Gabriel will settle quickly; he knows this is his big chance. And he’ll have a friend at the Emirates before a ball is kicked. Santi Cazorla knows all about swapping Villarreal for the Premier League albeit in his case via Malaga.
