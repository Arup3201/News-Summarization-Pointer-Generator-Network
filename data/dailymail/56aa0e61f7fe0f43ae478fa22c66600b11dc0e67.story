Mario Balotelli has left Liverpool's Melwood training ground after going through the rigours of a medical having reached an agreement to join the Premier League club.

The former Manchester City striker is on the brink of signing for Brendan Rodgers' side in a deal worth £125,000 per week. Balotelli earlier had scans at Spire Liverpool Hospital before completing the rest of the medical at Melwood.

However the Italian will not be available to make his debut against former club Manchester City on Monday night, with the registration deadline of midday having passed.

Waiting game: Supporters outside Melwood in the hope of catching Balotelli as he left on Friday

Tens of supporters swarmed around the Melwood gates at 9.04pm on Friday as Balotelli left in a people carrier with his entourage. 

Balotelli's agent held discussions on Thursday and Friday, with a key point believed to be the Merseyside outfit's desire to obtain some kind of guarantee about the discipline of the mercurial 24-year-old Italy striker.

The player on Thursday added credence to the reports that he is set to return to English football by saying it would be his last day at Milan's training ground.

The Serie A side followed that later with a statement on their website revealing he had said his farewells to his team-mates.

Liverpool have been looking for a marquee striker to replace the departed Luis Suarez this summer but their interest in Balotelli represents a remarkable about-turn from around three weeks ago.

When Liverpool played Milan in a friendly in the United States, manager Brendan Rodgers expressed admiration for Balotelli but subsequently 'categorically' said he was not a target.

Recently, however, a move for QPR's Loic Remy has collapsed while interest in former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o has cooled and attempts to sign Radamel Falcao from Monaco seem unrealistic.

With new signing Rickie Lambert the only frontline support for Daniel Sturridge and the transfer deadline nearing, a move for Balotelli has apparently become more attractive.

He is a proven performer and scored Italy's winner in the World Cup opener against England in Manaus.

But the baggage that comes with him is considerable. His spell at City from summer 2010 to January 2013 was a whirlwind one, with occasional sparkling performances interspersed with volatility on the field and erratic behaviour off it.

Prepared: Rodgers is ready to welcome Balotelli for his medical after agreeing personal terms with the striker

His numerous misdemeanours famously included fireworks being set off in his bathroom, throwing a dart at a youth-team player and training-ground bust-ups with team-mates and manager Roberto Mancini.

On the positive side he played a key role in the 2011 FA Cup win and contributed to the following year's Premier League success, but he also hindered progress by accruing four red cards.

City - for whom he scored a total of 30 goals in 80 appearances in all competitions - eventually tired of the circus surrounding him and offloaded the former Inter star to his boyhood club AC Milan.
