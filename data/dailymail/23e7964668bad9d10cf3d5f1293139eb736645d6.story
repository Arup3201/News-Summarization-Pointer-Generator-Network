A breakdancer has proved he has perfect balance, by posing for pictures doing one-handed handstands outside France's most famous attractions.

'Kapstand' - who doesn't use his real name - has been snapped in front of the likes of the European Parliament in Strasbourg and the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.

The 29-year-old first became an Instagram sensation after snapping pictures of himself posing upside-down outside the most famous attractions in the French capital, but has since expanded his remit.

Dozens of famous landmarks in Paris were the background for the dancer doing handstands from the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe to the Louvre. 

The dancer has been practising b-boying, a dance technique which involves stopping the body while in motion and balancing very still, since he was 14.

He decided to expand his horizons by moving around France.

In future he hopes to visit to the US where he will produce his one-handed handstand in front of the country's most iconic landmarks.

Effortless: At Notre-Dame de la Garde in Marseille. His poses last just a few seconds which means most people don't notice him standing

He said: 'When I arrived in Paris I wanted to explore the city and its famous landmarks, so I took advantage of some walks in town with a friend to shoot some photos of my favourite move.

'I like to shoot in front of long perspectives, alignment and geometrical lines - and I also love using iconic landmarks.

'My freeze lasts just a few seconds - it's quite fast so most people around don't even notice.

'Some people are moved by my photos and love the poetry of this 'out of the blue' position, while others appreciate the athletic performance.'
