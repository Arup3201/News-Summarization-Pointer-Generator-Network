Amir Khan is not holding out any hope of ever seeing Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao meeting in the ring for the world's most eagerly anticipated fight .

A mega-money bout between Mayweather and Pacquiao appeared to be edging closer after the pair met at the half-time interval of the Miami Heat vs Milwaukee Bucks NBA game on Tuesday and then later in a hotel.

However, former light welterweight world champion Khan does not believe the waiting public will ever get to witness  the pair trading blows in the same ring.

The British boxer was speaking in an interview with BT Sport

Khan claims there is 'too much politics' surrounding the proposed £200m fight

Speaking in a Boxing Tonight special byBT Sport, the welterweight boxer said: 'Honestly that fight will never happen, in my opinion

'I spoke to Manny Pacquiao and, obviously, we speak to Mayweather and his team

'I can't really see that fight from happening, there is too much politics with that fight. There's different promotions teams and different management teams - I don't think they will let that fight happen.

'If it does happen, I'm a big boxing fan and I would love to see it.

'I want either one of those guys, if they are fighting each other then I can't argue because I would love to see that fight like everyone else

'It's a fight I've always waited for but it's taken so long that I can't see it happening.'

Mayweather was reported to have visited Pacquiao's hotel suite after the game in Miami to discuss the fight

Pacquiao is reportedly prepared to treat Mayweather Jnr as the ‘A side’ in an attempt to finalise the £200m mega-fight. 

Mayweather visited Pacquiao’s hotel suite in Miami on Tuesday night, hours after they had exchanged phone numbers during the basketball match.

During an hour-long conversation, both men showed a desire to stage the fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2.

The only outstanding issues raised during the meeting related to the broadcast of the bout. Mayweather is contracted to Showtime while Pacquiao’s fights are shown on HBO.

But Pacquiao’s adviser Michael Konz said those have been resolved and that any announcement about the fight will be made by Mayweather.

Meanwhile, Khan believes he is well placed to fight Mayweather - should a bout between with Pacquiao fail to materialise.

Khan told Sky Sports News HQ: 'If that fight falls through, I think I have to be the next fighter to face Mayweather because I've proven myself in many ways.

'Mayweather wanted me to prove myself at 147lbs which I did by beating Luis Collazo and then by moving up and beating Devon Alexander - two top guys in the welterweight division who were both coming off good wins. 

'The fight between me and him would be much easier to make than the Pacquiao fight because we have the same manager and the same promotions team, so why not get it done?' 

Boxing Tonight special with Amir Khan will be shown on BT Sport 1 at 10.15pm on Tuesday
