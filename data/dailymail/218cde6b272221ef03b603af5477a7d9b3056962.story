The CIA announced on Monday
that its inspector general, who investigated a dispute between
the agency and Congress regarding the handling of records of the
CIA's detention and interrogation activities, is resigning at the end of the month. 

The agency said in a statement that David Buckley, who had
served as the agency's internal watchdog for more than four
years, was leaving the agency to 'pursue an opportunity in the
private sector.'

Officials said his departure was unrelated to politics or
anything he had investigated.

Resigning: The CIA has announced that David Buckley, the agency's inspector general for more than four years, is stepping down at the end of the month 

Buckley's office last July issued a report on a dispute
between the agency and the Senate Intelligence Committee. 

The
report found that some agency employees had 'acted in a manner
inconsistent' with an understanding between the CIA 

It regarded five employees gaining access to a special computer network set up
to share documents about the agency's involvement in harsh
treatment of detained militants.

Buckley's office sent a report on its investigation to the
Justice Department, which declined to open a full criminal
investigation into the matter.

He was nominated for the position by President Barack Obama in August 2010. At the time he was a senior manager for Deloitte Consulting. 

It came after months of congressional frustration with the White House about not putting forth for a candidate for the job.

Several candidates had  been mentioned but none made the cut.

John Helgerson, his predecessor, stepped down in March 2009 - leaving the position vacant for a year.
