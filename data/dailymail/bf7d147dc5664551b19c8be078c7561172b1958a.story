Anthony Weiner's brother today 'categorically denied' attempting to silence the girl at the heart of the shamed congressman's latest sexting scandal.

Speaking to MailOnline, Jason, a chef in New York, claimed that he 'heard the name for the first time along with everyone else two days ago or perhaps yesterday?'

He insisted that he had 'never spoken to her or emailed or anything'.

But Leather's close friend and confidante, Lou Colagiovanni, said that the exchange had left her 'scared and shaken' and he stood by his claim.

Colagiovanni said that the contact was made on April 12 two days after an article ran in the New York Times in which Weiner presented himself as a reformed man, after the scandal that saw him leave Congress one year earlier.

Communications published in the original exposé by theDirty.com in which Weiner refers to a third party having contacted Leathers. Which begs the question if it wasn't his brother Jason, as Colagiovanni claims, then who was it?

Breaking her silence: Sydney Leathers, 23, talked to Inside Edition in an interview that aired Thursday night

Weiner's girl: Sydney Leathers, now 23, claimed that she and Weiner exchanged racy messages and photos for six months starting in July 2012

Her side: MailOnline can now reveal that Leathers' confidante claimed him that Weiner's brother Jason tried to keep her from telling her story

Certainly Mr Colagiovanni is adamant 
that Leathers was 'scared and shaken' by an attempt to silence her at a 
time when, she insisted, she had told nobody of the relationship.

Ms Leathers, who reportedly wants to 
sell her story for $100,000, gave an interview to Inside Edition saying 
that Weiner, who is married and has a young son, told her that he loved 
her during their six-month affair.

In
 an interview with MailOnline, Lou Colagiovanni , 29, a friend and 
confidante of Leathers for two years claims: ‘This happened on April 12, 2013. Weiner’s brother contacted Sydney because she had written something about Weiner on her Facebook wall.

‘His brother was trying to smooth-over any problems which leads me to believe he may have done this before with other mistresses.

‘Sydney was scared by the contact. Bear in mind she had never spoken to the brother. Absolutely she was shaken by it.

‘You have to remember at that stage she hadn’t told anyone about the relationship.

‘She had been sitting on it for months. Initially she didn’t want the story to come out but this was very clearly a damage control exercise.’

When contacted this afternoon, Weiner's spokesperson, told MailOnline: 'This is untrue'.

Proof: Anthony Weiner sent Sydney Leathers a message saying that his brother had asked him about her months before Jason Weiner denied knowing who she was or sending her a 'scary' warning.

Damage control: Anthony Weiner (seen left at a kitchen event on Thursday) reportedly had his brother Jason (a professional chef, at right) talk to Leathers about the status of their virtual affair

According to Mr Colegiovanni: ‘The brothers were acting as each other’s wingmen. It seemed quite clearly what Weiner had his brother do for him – damage control.

‘The irony is by doing so all they did was cause all this to come out because it left Sydney scared. She sent me a message and said she had a story she wanted to tell me.’

At that stage, Mr Colegiovanni pointed out: ‘Only Sydney and her psychotherapist new about it.’

The new claim of Weiner’s effort to put a lid on Leathers having clearly detected her growing frustration and distaste for the man she once ‘idolized’ is even more damaging in light of his recent ‘mea culpa,' in which he claimed to have always been resigned to more information coming out.

Mr Colegiovanni first met Sydney in April 2010 when he employed her as moderator and content producer and editor of his political website ‘We Survived Bush You Will Survive Obama.’

The fixer: Ms Leather's friend claimed that Jason Weiner approached the issue as if it was not his first time cleaning up Anthony's mess - again a claim the sibling has denied

Coming clean: Anthony Weiner, seen here at a food center on Thursday, said that he sexted with a total of 'six to ten' women, both before and after his resignation from Congress

He became a close friend and confidante of the girl he describes as ‘beautiful and extremely intelligent.’

‘I was initially shocked by what she told me and showed me,’ he admitted, recalling Leathers’ revelations to him which began that April and carried over into May.

According to Mr Colegiovanni the conversations between Leathers and Weiner were about politics at first but steadily grew more sexual in nature.

He said: ‘He offered her a condo in Chicago. He offered to pay for it. He offered to help her move. He said “I’m huge” referring to his muscles indicating he could help her move furniture.’

Eager: Ms Leathers first struck up a conversation with Weiner about his politics but their chats quickly turned sexual and graphic

Buying her off: Weiner allegedly said that he would get her a condo in Chicago where they could meet for trysts in person, as well as lining up a placement on a Politico panel in exchange for her deleting their messages

He continued: ‘I believe that this condo in Chicago was to be nothing more than a sex den for Anthony Weiner so he could show up and have his way with her and go back to his wife and pretend he’s like a happy family man.’

Sydney idolized this man, Mr Colegiovanni explained.

He said: ‘She told me in our conversations that she thought she was in love with him and the way it was described to me she slowly developed a disdain for him in her mind.’

She thought he was ‘a righteous man’ he added who just liked younger women but ‘as the relationship unfolded and became more graphic and just about sex that changed.’

He claimed that Weiner called Leathers to talk about sex or have phone sex ‘every single day for six months.’

Continuing on: In spite of the repeated calls for him to drop out of the New York City mayor's race- and the fact he has dropped down to second place- Weiner refuses to give up

Sydney expressed increasing disdain for Weiner in May as he stepped up his campaign with the promotion of his Keys to the City programme.

Leathers contacted Mr Colegiovanni to tell him she felt ‘disgusted’ by Weiner: ‘She told me that Antonhy Weiner had contacted her one week after his last big mea culpa in public saying how sorry he was for his mistakes and how his wife was standing by him and he had changed and by her disclosing that to me, it makes perfect sense because it was during the time the relationship was ongoing and shows to me that all he is saying now is a lie.’

Leathers, now 23 but she was 22 when they had their relationship, spoke out to Inside Edition for the first time since her identity was revealed to say that she was truly in love with the disgraced former Congressman.

She believed the feelings to be mutual, but now she is 'disgusted by him'.

Leathers told how she was initially attracted to Weiner because of his politics but now she has seen another side of him.

'He's not who I thought he was,' she said.

Not listening to the numbers: A poll taken after the scandal showed that Weiner lost his lead in the race and slipped from first place to second by a significant margin, leaving City Council speaker Chris Quinn in the lead

She said that both she and Weiner said that they loved each other during their virtual romance, and Indiana-based Leathers has previously said that he offered to secure a condo for her in Chicago so that they could meet for trysts beyond the computer screen.

When asked what she would like to say to him now, she responded: 'Stop lying, stop embarrassing his wife, and get help.'

A preview of her interview with Inside Edition was released shortly after Weiner held a press conference on Thursday afternoon where he disclosed an approximate break down of his sexting timeline, just hours after the latest poll revealed he has lost his front-runner lead in the New York City mayoral race.

When asked to clarify how many of those relationships started after he resigned from Congress in June 2011, he said: 'I don't believe more than three'.

By his side: Huma Abedin revealed on Tuesday that she was aware of his indiscretions 'before and after' his resignation and they decided to launch his mayoral campaign

Today has not been good in terms of any numbers for Weiner, as the first poll since the Leathers revelation shows that he has been bumped out of the lead in the mayoral race.

His drop in the polls comes as Weiner confirmed he had virtual relationships with three women after his 2011 resignation from Congress and between six and ten similar situations prior to leaving office.

The first poll conducted after his relationship with then-22-year-old Sydney Leather was revealed just came out Thursday afternoon and has City Council Speaker Christine Quinn leading with 25 per cent of the Democratic vote.

Weiner comes in second place with only 16 per cent- down from his earlier 26 per cent lead from a different poll that measured the public's thinking the week preceding the Tuesday revelations.

In addition to taking away his lead, the release of naked photos and explicit sex chats have driven up his unfavorability rating, bringing him up to an 'all-time high' of 55 per cent.

By comparison, his unfavorables were only at 36 per cent in June.
