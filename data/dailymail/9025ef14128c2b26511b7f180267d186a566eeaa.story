A couple in Nevada are fighting for a change in the law after being denied the chance to become foster parents because they have permits to carry guns.

Brian and Valerie Wilson of Las Vegas say they had always planned to become foster parents and adopt, but were shocked to discovered that they couldn't because of their guns.

On Wednesday they testified before the state Assembly Judiciary Committee to ask lawmakers to approve a bill that would allow residents to carry loaded weapons on their person or in a car and still serve as foster parents. Their request was denied.

'I am really heartbroken that the Department of Child and Family Services gave us this denial letter,' Valerie Wilson told Las Vegas Review Journal. 'I really want a family.'

The Wilsons said they got the gun permits years ago after they were victims of an attempted home invasion.

The Wilson's bill would have allowed Nevadans with concealed-weapons permits, and law enforcement officers, to carry loaded weapons on their person in a home or car and still be eligible to be foster parents.

If not carried on their person, the weapons would be required to be kept in a secure safe, but they could remain loaded.

Current rules reportedly require guns and ammunition to be stored separately in secure containers in homes with foster children. 

'It just doesn't make sense,' Brian Wilson told Fox News. 'We're talking about law-abiding people, people who have had background checks.

'We're not talking about leaving a firearm around the house,' he said.

The bill was sponsored by Assemblywoman Michele Fiore, R-Las Vegas.

'We have children in need of great foster care, and we have had people that are law-abiding citizens that have gotten their background checks, that have their CCWs, literally denied to foster a child because they have a concealed-weapons permit,' she said. 

The bill was opposed by Assemblywoman Olivia Diaz, D-North Las Vegas, who said foster children are often traumatized and exposure to weapons would be inappropriate.

The committee also heard from Jill Marano, deputy administrator of the state Division of Child and Family Services, who opposed the bill in its current form.

While the agency's goal was to work with foster parents, she said she had grave concerns and cited 16 incidents over the past four months in which children were involved in the accidental discharge of a loaded weapon.
