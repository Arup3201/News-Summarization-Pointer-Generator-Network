The First World War's last surviving battleship is on course to be transformed into a floating museum after provisionally securing a £12 million lottery funding boost.

The National Museum of the Royal Navy is now confident HMS Caroline will be opened as a 'world class' visitor attraction ahead of the centenary of its most famous wartime engagement - the 1916 Battle of Jutland off the coast of Denmark.

The derelict vessel, which is currently docked in the same Belfast shipyards where the Titanic was built, was in danger of rusting away before moves to restore it started to build up steam last year.

The Heritage Lottery Fund today gave initial approval to a £12.2 million funding application to finance the restoration - the largest ever commitment made by the HLF in Northern Ireland.

It has pledged £845,000 in first stage development funding and, if that work is completed as envisaged, the remainder of the money will then be released.

The museum would complement a variety of maritime attractions in Belfast's old shipyards, including the £97million Titanic Belfast visitor attraction.

A light cruiser, weighing 3,750 tons and measuring 446 feet, HMS Caroline was part of the screening force that sailed out ahead of the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet during the Battle of Jutland to establish the position of the German battleships.

Both sides sustained heavy casualties in what was the most significant clash between battleships during WWI. Britain and Germany both claimed victory.

Six years after the war ended HMS Caroline was moved from Portsmouth to Belfast to become a training vessel for local Royal Navy Reserves. Most of the rest of the fleet was decommissioned and broken up.

The HMS Caroline performed its function as a drill ship up until 2011, apart from during World War Two when it was used as an operations headquarters for the efforts to protect the Atlantic convoys from German U-Boats.

Captain John Rees, chief of staff at the National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN), said the significance of the ship could not be overstated.

'She is a one of a kind, an iconic ship," he said.

'The only floating survivor of all the fleets - both German and British - that fought in the First World War and the Battle of Jutland.'

Captain Rees said he was confident the museum would be open ahead of the 100th anniversary in May 2016.

'The National Museum has a view, along with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, that there is the opportunity here to create a world class visitor attraction for Belfast and for Northern Ireland with a number of hugely interesting and important naval and maritime attractions.

'Not only that, it's an opportunity I think to involve all of the community of Northern Ireland in something that is uniquely Belfast and Northern Ireland.

'It's been here for the majority of its life - 80 plus years. It is something that all the community can share in and enjoy - it's something very special for them.'

There had been fears in Belfast that the NMRN was going to bring the ship back to Portsmouth, but those were allayed last year when an agreement was struck to keep the vessel in its current home in the Alexandra Dock.

The ship will undergo basic repairs and will then receive a £12 million lottery fund

A £1million grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund was then secured for urgent repairs. That was seen as the first stage in a two part rescue mission - the second element being the lottery application.

Paul Mullan, head of HLF Northern Ireland, said the funding reflected the importance of the ship.

'At £12 million, that's twice the size of the next largest grant that has ever been given to Northern Ireland,' he said.

'It's very timely. We are now in the decade of anniversaries and the First World War is one of those key anniversaries. We've 1916 with the (Battle of the) Somme, the 1916 Easter Rising (in Dublin).

The Battle of Jutland is another particular story which is of tremendous importance.

'We see it very much in that context of a number of anniversaries that are going on and this is a great way of showing Belfast's link into the First World War.'

Northern Ireland Tourism Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the funding boost.

'Over the last year, there has been a significant effort, from myself and others to find a solution to keeping HMS Caroline here," she said.

'We have developed a strong partnership with the National Museum of the Royal Navy. This partnership will continue as we restore the ship.

'HMS Caroline has become part of the city's rich maritime heritage.'

She added: 'Our ultimate aim is to transform the ship into a world-class floating museum in time for the Battle of Jutland centenary in 2016, as I believe HMS Caroline has huge potential as a visitor experience.'
