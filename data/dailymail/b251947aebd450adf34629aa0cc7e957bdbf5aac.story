A British mother of two who has languished in a ‘hellish’ Caribbean prison for seven months on suspicion of murdering her husband has made a heartfelt plea to be released – insisting he died in a tragic road accident.

Since July, Nicola Reyes, 37, has been held without charge in a cramped cell with 15 other women in the Dominican Republic, where she has lived for nine years.

She is accused of deliberately running over her husband Jorge, 37, in her SUV as he rode beside her on a motorbike after a night out.

Happy times: Mother-of-two Nicola Reyes, 37, has languished in a Dominican Republic jail cell for seven months after being accused of murdering her husband jorge in the Dominican Republic

But Mrs Reyes claims he died when she accidentally hit his motorcycle as he swerved out of the way of an oncoming car.

Police arrived on the scene and told 
Mrs Reyes they would take her to hospital – but took her to a prison 
where she has remained ever since.

The authorities are currently 
deciding whether to charge her with manslaughter or murder – a 
notoriously lengthy process in the country. She faces up to 30 years in 
prison if found guilty of murder.

Her family have been fighting to have
her freed since she was jailed and describe the prison conditions as 
‘absolutely horrendous’.

Paradise isle: Nicola swapped her home in Rumney, Cardiff, for the golden sands and turquoise seas of the Dominican Republic nine years ago.

Romance: Shortly after moving to The Dominican Republic she met islander Jorge, 37, who had been a teenage coconut water salesman, and the pair enjoyed a whirlwind romance

Mrs Reyes told ITV News: ‘It’s very 
difficult, I don’t see any light at the end of the tunnel, and right now
I’m feeling I’m struggling.

‘It is very difficult every day 
talking to my family knowing that they love me and they’re trying to 
hard to fight for me. I’ve never felt so alone’.

Her mother Jeannette Clements, 61, said: ‘There were people murdered in there; there were people beaten in there.

‘She was in a tiny room which was only about 12ft by 12ft and there were 15 women in there.

‘She was literally sleeping on the floor, there was a bucket in the corner and they were not allowed out at all.’

Happy family: Nicole Reyes plays in a swimming pool with her husband Jorge and her children Leah, 17, and Luke, 16, who have have returned to live in Britain since her arrest

Mrs Reyes’ children Leah, 17, and 
Luke, 17, have moved back to the UK to be with their grandparents and 
speak to their mother every day on the phone.

Daughter Leah said: ‘All we want is 
for mum to be home. We look forward to speaking to her on the phone but 
when it comes to say goodbye it’s horrible because she’s a mess.’

Mrs Reyes moved to the Dominican 
Republic from her home in Rumney, Cardiff, after falling in love with 
country on a holiday there.

She took a holiday rep job with Thomas Cook and met Jorge, a coconut water salesman.

Tragic death: Nicole and Jorge's relationship ended in tragedy when he was killed as they drove home one evening. He had been riding his Yamaha 125 motorcycle alongside Nicola's Toyota SUV when she ran him over

'Horrendous': Speaking from her home in Cardiff, mother Jeannette Clements, 61, told of her daughter's prison hell - with no prospect of bail - describing the 'horrendous conditions'

After a whirlwind romance the couple married and set up home near the costal city of Puerto Plata.
Mrs Clements added: ‘She is innocent but she has no chance of a fair trial out there.

‘All we can do is stay strong for her, but sometimes you just feel like you can’t cope. It is the same with my daughter.

‘But she’s getting more bad days now as time goes on, because we didn’t expect it to go on for this length of time.’

A spokesman for human rights 
organisation Fair Trials International said: ‘Individuals arrested in 
the Dominican Republic may face lengthy periods of pre-trial detention 
in prison conditions falling far below international standards.

‘In a criminal justice system 
reported to be struggling with poor administration and corruption, 
foreign nationals with little knowledge of the local language and the 
legal system are particularly vulnerable to breaches of their basic 
rights to a fair trial.’

A spokesman for the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office said: ‘We can confirm a British national was 
arrested in the Dominican Republic on July 10, 2012. We are providing 
consular assistance.’
