Lille are weighing up a move for Sunderland’s unsettled striker Jozy Altidore.

The USA international has failed to start a Barclays Premier League game this season.

Lille see Altidore as a potential replacement for Liverpool loanee Divock Origi, who will head back to his parent club at the end of the current campaign.

Divock Origi was bought by Liverpool from Lille for £10m, but loaned back to the Ligue 1 side

The 25-year-old is desperate for first-team football and could leave the club after his move to Wearside last summer.

But Sunderland will want to recoup much of the £7million they paid AZ Alkmaar for his services. 

The Ligue 1 outfit, who are currently 14th in the table, are third in Everton's Europa League group.
