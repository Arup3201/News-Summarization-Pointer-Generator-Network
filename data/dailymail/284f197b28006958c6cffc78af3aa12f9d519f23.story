The father of notorious suspected terrorist Mohamed Elomar has spoken out for the first time, saying he is ashamed of his son.

Lebanese immigrant Mamdouh Elomar - who came to Australian shores 40 years ago - said Mohamed had always been a devout Muslim, but his jump into jihad was only recent.

Mamdouh is also close friends with the man his son threatened on Twitter, Dr Jamal Rifi - who condemned the younger Elomar for his role as a fighter for terror group Islamic State in Syria.

Coincidentally, the friends grew up on the same street as the father of Mohamed's Islamic State brother-in-arms, convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, in Tripoli, The Australian revealed.

Mohamed targeted Dr Rifi - who lives in Sydney - on August 13 in a tweet that read: 'Anyone in Sydney who can give me the details of Habashi dog Dr Jamal Rifi, anything, house details, wat (sic) area am willing to pay $1000'.

In a further tweet, he asked: 'Any details were he works or knows if his (sic) got kids which school they attend.'

Dr Rifi's comments came after pictures posted by Mohamed's fellow Islamic State brother-in-arms, convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, showed a boy believed to be his son holding up a severed head as well as others of young children brandishing weapons.

Mamdouh said every time he saw his son on the news he could not help but feel ashamed by Mohamed's actions.

The senior Elomar has not heard from his son in two years after he kicked him out of his western Sydney home when his son was caught shoplifting at Sydney Airport.

Before taking up with Islamic State, Mohamed was a boxer and worked as a surveyor or a draftsman at his father's business.

These images of Khaled Sharrouf's son holding a severed head (left) and Sharrouf with young children holding weapons sparked condemnation world-wide, including from Dr Rifi

'I haven't heard from him for two years, only what I have seen on the TV,' Mamdouh told The Daily Telegraph.

'I cannot understand what my son did, it makes me want to vomit.'

To restore Australians' goodwill in the religion that has been smeared by the likes of Mohamed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf, Mamdouh and Dr Rifi are holding a 'Muslims 4 Australia' barbecue on September 14 in Lakemba 'to show the rest of society that Muslims view ourselves as part of Australia'.

Despite having threats levelled at him, Dr Rifi has previously told Daily Mail Australia he was not afraid.

'Their actions shouldn't instil fear among us to the point where that fear will paralyse us,' he said.

'And that's why I would refuse to be fearful of their threats'.

Dr Rifi made a number of public statements where he denounced the actions of the Australian terrorists.

'What we saw to be honest, (is) very disturbing, especially when it's done in the name of Islam,' Dr Rifi said.

'And it can only be done by a very sick person'.

Sharrouf fled Australia on his brother's passport to Syria last year to fight for ISIS.

Dr Rifi, a prominent member of Sydney's Islamic community, was a finalist in the 2009 Australian Local Hero awards.

Dr Rifi said he was familiar with Khaled Sharrouf's father, but had never met the younger Sharrouf who has turned to terrorism.

He has played an instrumental part in forging positive relationships between the Muslim and wider Australian communities. 

He was a founding member of Muslim Doctors Against Violence and the Christian Muslim Friendship Society.

He helped recruit and train Muslim youth as surf lifesavers at Cronulla beach following riots in the Sydney Shire suburb in 2005.
