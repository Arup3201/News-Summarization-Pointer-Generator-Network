Roy Hodgson insists that England's faith in Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck has paid off handsomely this season.

The former Manchester United player has been selected by Hodgson whenever he has been available and repaid that confidence by netting five times for the Three Lions this season, while also impressing at the Emirates with his new club.

Hodgson told the FA website: 'Danny Welbeck, of the young England players, is one of the most experienced because we have always kept faith with him.

'Even in the first squad I selected in 2012, Danny was in it, despite the fact that at the time he wasn't featuring for Manchester United.

'We've kept faith with him through that time until his move to Arsenal where he is now getting lots and lots of plaudits.'

Hodgson is no stranger to selecting young players who may not always be in the starting line-ups for their clubs, but praised the 24-year-old for being able to step up at international level.

'Even during those two years when he wasn't playing every week, he still did a good job when he came with the national team,' Hodgson said.

'Strangely in the last six months I have to choose less and less of these younger players who don't get a game in their starting line-ups for their teams because they seem to have broken into their starting line-ups, which I'm pleased about.

'I would like to hope that some of their performances for England have even accelerated their chances of being one of the first names on their club teamsheet.'

The England manager also reserved praise for Wayne Rooney, saying his transformation from leading player to captain has been seamless.  

'Wayne Rooney took on two very important roles - captain of Manchester United under a new manager and then captain of England, taking over from a man he admired and was very friendly with, Steven Gerrard,' he said.

'Steven did a fantastic job in my first couple of years with the national team.

'I think Wayne had to step into big shoes and I think he has done that exceptionally well and taken a lot of responsibility.'
