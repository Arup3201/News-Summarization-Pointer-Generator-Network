Bad teacher: Carissa Bryant, 33, a sixth-grade teacher from Iowa, has been charged with public intoxication for allegedly showing up to class drunk

A sixth-grade teacher from Iowa has been arrested on suspicion of showing up to class drunk.

The Marshall County Sheriff's Office says 33-year-old Carissa Bryant, of Marshalltown, was arrested Wednesday and charged with public intoxication.

Police say they responded to a report from Marshalltown Community School District of a possible intoxicated teacher at Leninhan Intermediate School.

Testing at Marshall County Jail showed Bryant had a blood alcohol level of 0.19, more than twice the legal limit in Iowa.

The 33-year-old educator was later released from jail after posting $300 bond.

District spokesman Andrew Potter says Bryant has been placed on administrative leave pending investigation.

Police say the case has been referred to the Marshall County Attorney's Office for further review.

Sheirff's deputies were called to the school after administrators received a tip that a teacher at Lenhihan may be intoxicated. 

The deputy who responded to Leninhan Intermediate School noted that the married mother of one smelled like alcohol, had bloodshot eyes and was slurring her words

Chief Sheriff's Deputy Steve Hoffman told Times Republican that a colleague of his smelled the odor of alcohol on Bryant's breath. The 33-year-old, who is married and has a son, had bloodshot eyes and was slurring her words.

According to police, Bryant, who teaches language arts and social studies, admitted she had been drinking before the start of school Wednesday morning.
