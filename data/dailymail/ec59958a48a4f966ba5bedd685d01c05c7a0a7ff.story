Ann Shoebridge, 66, from Nottingham started online dating five years ago. She has since been targeted by con men eight times 

Ann Shoebridge started online dating five years ago after her marriage ended. 

The 66-year-old from Nottingham signed up to a couple of sites after hearing success stories from friends.

But after being on the receiving end of no less than eight attempts at fraud, the retired IT lecturer has almost given up any hope of ever finding another man. 

Con men have targeted her with a number of creative stories, ranging from their children needing immediate medical treatment, to suggestions that she share the cost of the man's travel expenses to fly to the UK for a date.  

She said: 'I’ve had a couple of guys that had ‘sick children’ and desperately need an operation in the next few hours, otherwise they’ll die.

'The very first wannabe scammer pretended to have a sick child.

'He very quickly wanted to start chatting on MSN. I guess most of them do actually, because it is away from the dating site. 

'I wasn't very experienced on these sites, but I knew it was a scam when he asked for money. 

'Plus, his profile picture reminded me of the kind of male models you get on knitting patterns! 

'I now respond with, “yes of course I’ll help you, you poor man, give me your phone number,” and then I pass it to an online fraud site.'

But it isn't just that she has been lied to, one of the most disheartening aspects is that these ruses often come after Ann has wasted at least eight weeks and a degree of hope on conversations with the man in question.

The fraudster can often take months to build up a story that they think is convincing, trying to give off an air of personal wealth before approaching the issue of borrowing money.

Ann said: 'Then there was one man on match.com who was very good looking and lived fairly local to me, 20 miles away.

'We had been speaking for quite a while before I suggested meeting up for coffee and he said, “I can’t, I have to go to Dubai tomorrow on business.” 

'We exchanged numbers and he called me from ‘Dubai’ and I remember thinking that he didn't sound like a white man - like he appeared in his pictures.  

Fraudsters regularly patrol dating websites, hoping to convince vulnerable and lonely women that they are a trustworthy man who is looking for a relationship 

'He gave me a story about being born in South Africa, then moving to Germany and eventually England, where he had been for 25 years, but he didn’t have an English accent.' 

Then eventually, the man started to broach the issue of money. 

Ann said: 'In a conversation quite a few weeks down the line, he told me that it was his birthday soon and he was hoping to buy himself a Rolex, it was a comment designed to make you think that he has a bob or two.

'Then he started asking me what kind of jewelry I wore and he asked me to photograph my hands and send the picture to him.

'He’d apparently been back home but was away again on business, this time in Rome. 

'So over a period of eight weeks he was really grooming me. 

'Then he mentioned that he really needed £500 to pay his hotel bill.

'I don't have that kind of money to spare, but even if I did there is no way I’d give a complete stranger. 

People on dating websites are warned never to hand over any financial details to potential suitors 

'I said no, you’re a scammer and he got very uppity and angry. 

'Then we talked several weeks later and I asked him if he was Nigerian and he admitted that he was.'

But far from being put off by the shame of being caught out, the man was back on the same site within weeks. 

In another incident, an American serviceman claiming to be in Special Ops said he was working in Iraq, which meant he couldn't access his own money.

He asked if Ann could wire him £500 as a loan until he was able to return home. 

She said: 'I was wary from the moment he said he was in Special Ops, because if that is anything like the SAS, he probably wouldn't have been able to tell me. 

Ann is trying to remain optimistic, despite several bad experiences 

'I insisted on Skype, so that I could see what he looked like and immediately thought that the place he was in didn't look much like Iraq. 

'Then he asked me to send him $500 as he couldn’t access his own money. 

'I eventually told him I thought he was a scammer and he was very indignant and started shouting.

'I screen grabbed the messages and reported him to the dating site, but they never came back to me and within a matter of days this man had two more identities.

'He used the same photos, but different names and different locations, places like Wolverhampton.' 

Ann has never handed over any money, always suspecting foul play. 

But after being duped several times, the mother-of-two was too disappointed to carry on looking for love any longer.

She eventually signed back up after realising that it was one of the best chances she has of finding another man to share her life. 

She said: 'I am retired and although I’m quite busy with various things during the day, I don’t get the opportunity to go out much at night and how else will I meet a man other than online?

'I’m lonely, I’d like a man in my life but I feel like I’m not going to find one. 

'If nothing else, being on these sites gives me hope - I’m a glass half full sort of person and I live in hope.

'I guess I probably never will meet somebody, but if I’m on a dating site then I’m in with a chance, it’s a bit like the lottery.'
