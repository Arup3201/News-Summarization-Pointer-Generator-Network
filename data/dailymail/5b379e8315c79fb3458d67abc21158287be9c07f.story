Killed: Patrick Sibley, 21, a student at George Mason University, was hit by the inbound Orange Line train shortly before 2 a.m. on Sunday

A 6-foot-8 college volleyball star has been struck and killed by a subway train outside Washington D.C. after he apparently got lost on the way home from a bar.

Patrick Sibley, 21, a student at George Mason University, was hit by the inbound Orange Line Metrorail train shortly before 2 a.m. on Sunday while on the tracks between East Falls Church and Ballston stations in Arlington, Virginia. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

His older brother, Shaun Sibley, 23, believes the athlete, who he said had a poor sense of direction and wasn't familiar with the Metrorail system, got off at the wrong station and sprinted down the tracks in the direction of Ballston before getting struck by the train.

'It is more than likely that he thought he could do anything,' Shaun told the Washington Post. 'He was a big, strong, athletic kid. He didn't take no for an answer.'

The men's grandfather, William Rice Jr. agreed: 'Knowing him, I believe he said, "The shortest distance between two points is straight ahead," and he started on the tracks.'

Patrick would have been a senior at George Mason, where he played on the men's volleyball team.

His brother said Patrick was heading home from a Clarendon bar to a townhouse he had just rented with friends in Vienna for the school year.

He had spent Saturday moving his belongings into the house and went with friends to the bar afterwards. Alcohol is likely to have played a part in the incident, which remains under investigation.

The college confirmed Patrick Sibley, who drew up in San Diego and later moved to Massachusetts, was the individual killed in the accident.

'The Mason community is deeply saddened to hear of the death of Patrick Sibley,' said Tom O'Connor, George Mason athletic director, in a statement. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, his friends, teammates, and all who are affected by this tragedy.'

Shaun, who is 6-foot-9, also played volleyball for George Mason and the brothers were extremely close though enjoyed a healthy rivalry. He had changed his Facebook profile to a picture of his brother on Monday.

Patrick Sibley was a star player in Natick High School's 2007 state title team when he was a freshman and Shaun, was a senior.

Patrick graduated from Natick High in 2010. He then spent a year playing volleyball at Sacred Heart University, but transferred to George Mason the following year to be with his brother.

He sat out the 2012 season due to NCAA transfer rules, but made an impact in his first season as a Patriot in 2013, when he was named to the All-Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association first team.

He led George Mason with 77 blocks and was second in services aces with 21.

'Patrick Sibley was a world-class athlete,' George Mason head coach Fred Chao told The Boston Globe. 'In a brief period of time he quickly developed into a dominant volleyball player. However, it was his love for his teammates and friends that shined the brightest.'

Peter Suxho, who coached the brothers at Natick High, heard the news on Monday and described Patrick as a dedicated player who was first to get to practice and the last to leave.

'He was tall for his age,' Suxho told The Globe. 'He had a lot of desire to be like his brother.'

Patrick and Shaun played together last season, when the Patriots finished 15-12, capped by a loss to Harvard in the EIVA Tournament semifinals. Shaun graduated in May.
