Mystery: Trey Kurtz, 20, was found shot dead at a quiet intersection in Brenham, Texas late on Thursday night in a case that has stumped authorities and the student's family and friends

Alan Kurtz told Click2Houston that his son was finally himself again and ready to start school, so they picked a campus close to home. But just months later, tragedy struck.

Now he is trying to find out what had happened to his youngest son, whom he called 'my best friend'.

'From what I heard, his roommate wanted to go to a party or something, and roommate decided not to [but Kurtz] decided to go to it and was walking over there,' Mr Kurtz told the channel.

'I don't know if he got in a scuffle or a fight and someone pulled a gun on him, or if it was a drive by. I don't know.

'All I know is that someone took a big piece of my life away from me that can't be replaced.'

Investigators told News3 that Kurtz dies of a single gunshot wound, but would not say where on his body he had suffered the wound.

A witness told police they heard what sounded like a gun shot in the area about an hour before the student's body was found, KWTX reported.

A car was also seen speeding east on Seelhorst just after the shot was heard.

His body was found more than a mile from his college and he did not have his car, witnesses said.

The body has been taken to the Travis County Medical Examiner in Austin for an autopsy.

No one has been arrested in the case and investigators are urging anyone with information to contact police in Brenham. 

'We're going to do everything we can to make sure this case gets solved,' Brenham Police Chief Rex Phelps said.

Friends remembered Trey as a sweet friend and a sports fanatic, who had been on his school wrestling team and loved playing baseball, football and soccer.
