The eyewitness who took a video of Orlando Bloom throwing a punch at Justin Bieber has said that it wasn't their only scuffle on the night - and that the actor was being cheered on by his A-list pals at the time.

Former Spanish journalist Anastasia Skolkova was quick to share her video of the fight, which took place at Cipriana restaurant in Ibiza on Wednesday night, using Twitter and Facebook.

But she told The Mirror, that the Pirates of The Caribbean actor threw more than one punch at pop singer Justin, much to the delight of fellow diners, which happened to include Leonardo DiCaprio, Lindsay Lohan and P Diddy on the night.

Not the first time: An eye witness says there was more than one punch thrown during an altercation between Justin Bieber and Orlando Bloom in Ibiza

The eyewitness remembers the Baby singer provoking the first punch.

'Justin said something when he came in which was aimed at Orlando, who then jumped onto a sofa to try and get at Justin.' she recalls.

She added to the Daily Mirror: 'When Orlando punched Bieber, everyone started clapping. Lindsay was laughing. It was amazing. The whole table he and DiCaprio were on were clapping. Afterwards, I don't know if people were congratulating Orlando or trying to calm him down.'When security saw that when they got separated, Bieber and Orlando tried to punch each other again, security were like, 'Bieber came, Bieber provoked this fight', so they took his hands behind his back and took him away from the restaurant.'

Anastasia, who was sitting next to Orlando's table where he dined with actor Leonardo Dicaprio before the fight broke out, filmed Bieber allegedly yelling, 'What’s up, b***?' to Bloom in the video.

She said: 'There were actually two moments when it turned violent, it wasn't just the one punch thrown.'

The two men met by chance at the Spanish eatery, but appear to have a common connection in Orlando's estranged wife Miranda Kerr.

One 
version of the event hears that 20-year-old Bieber told Orlando he had slept with 
Miranda, whom he first met at a Victoria's Secret show in 2012, to prompt him 
to hit the singer.

Justin told Orlando to 'Say hi to Miranda for me!' just moments after the actor tried to punch him, one onlooker told MailOnline.

The New York Post reported on Thursday that Bloom 'never looked at her [Miranda] the same', after rumours of a hook-up between her and Bieber at the 2012 Victoria's Secret show in New York (a year before the couple announced their marital break-up).

Representatives for Bloom and Bieber have refused to comment on the restaurant fight, despite the in-depth eye witness accounts.

Meanwhile, Bieber has continued to provoke the English actor by posting a picture of his former wife Miranda in a bikini with a crown symbol caption, followed by a picture of Orlando Bloom wiping his eyes as if to cry.

Miranda on the other hand, has used Instagram to prove that she's not getting involved.

Posting a series of model shots from recent campaigns and a sweet mother-son picture with the couple's little boy Flynn Bloom, the former Mrs Bloom can be seen to turn her back on the whole situation.
