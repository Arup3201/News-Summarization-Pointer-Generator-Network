Convicted murderer and Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel has been denied parole, a decade after being given a life sentence for beating his teenage neighbor to death with a golf club.

Skakel's request was rejected following a two-hour hearing on Wednesday in which he proclaimed his innocence.

The chair of the parole board at the Connecticut prison, Erika 
Tindill, said it was odd for Skakel to ask for early release while 
proclaiming he is innocent.

The victim's mother, Dorothy Moxley, said during the hearing in Suffield that Skakel should serve at least 20 years.

Skakel told the board that it 'is not an easy question to answer' as to whether he should be paroled, according to the Hartford Courant.

He added that he knew the best chance of being paroled was for him to admit to the crime.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr had appealed for
his cousin's release, saying in a letter that Skakel is a model inmate 
and devoted to God. Skakel has submitted 65 letters in support of his 
release.

Skakel, 52, spoke slowly and softly 
during the hearing at McDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in 
Suffield, Connecticut saying: 'I did not commit this crime.'

Other
Kennedys have rallied around their relative, claiming that his trial 
was a miscarriage of justice. However relatives of 15-year-old murder 
victim Martha Moxley say Skakel has shown no remorse and should remain 
in prison for the rest of his life.

Skakel said on Wednesday that he prays every day that whoever committed the crime is brought to justice, but he is the wrong man.

'If I could ease Mrs. Moxley's pain in any way, shape or form I would take responsibility all day long for this crime,' Skakel said.

He added: 'I cannot bear false witness against myself.'

The heavyset, 52-year-old Skakel with gray, thinning hair wore a beige prison jumpsuit to the hearing. To support his claims of innocence, he told of how he became sober.

'I pose to you: how can a guilty man stay sober for 30 years with that kind of guilt on his mind?' he said.

Skakel, convicted in 2002, is eligible for parole consideration because of laws in place at the time of the crime including good behavior credits.

Supporter: Robert F Kennedy Jr has appealed for his cousin Michael Skakel's release

In letters to the parole board, Skakel's supporters, including his cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said Skakel has helped alcoholics recover.

They also portray him as religious and devoted to his son.

Many letters cite Skakel's art work in prison, saying he has made uplifting paintings that show his true nature, give joy to others and encourage family values.

Letters objecting to his parole cite the brutal nature of the crime and say releasing him early would be devastating to the victim's family.

'This person committed a heinous crime that gave many people a sentence of suffering that was irreversible,' one of the letters states.

'Why then should this person be given relief, when none is available for those who suffered the loss of a daughter, a sister, a dear friend.'

On Tuesday, Skakel filed a defamation lawsuit against CNN television host Nancy Grace and Tru-TV host Beth Karas, alleging they made false statements about evidence of Skakel's DNA near the crime scene.

The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court in Stamford, also named media companies Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting as defendants.

Skakel
was sentenced to 20 years to life for beating Martha Moxley to death 
with a golf club in 1975 in Greenwich when they were 15-year-old 
neighbors. Skakel is a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel 
Kennedy.

Martha Moxley was just 15-years-old when she was brutally murdered close to her home in Connecticut

'There's never been a person more deserving of parole than Michael Skakel,' his attorney, Hope Seeley, said in a statement.

Michael Skakel was only 15 at the time his 15-year-old neighbor Martha Moxley was beaten to death with a golf club in 1975.

Skakel was arrested 25 years later in 2000.

He was finally indicted for murder afer a 1998 book written about the events of that night suggested Michael had been at the scene.

He had said he was at his cousin's house at the time of the murder.

However, Michael later admitted that he had been masturbating in the tree house on the night before the victim's remains were found in the same spot.

Two former students of Elan, a boarding 
school where Skakel had been sent for alcohol addiction treatment in his late teens, also 
testified that Skakel had confessed to Miss Moxley's murder.

Other reports suggested that Skakel was jealous of his brother, Thomas's relationship with Miss Moxley. Thomas had long been considered a murder suspect.

According to former neighbor Gregory Coleman, Michael Skakel had bragged: 'I'm going to get away with murder. I'm a Kennedy.'

Michael Skakel is the nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel 
Kennedy.

On June 6, 1968, Senator Kennedy was assassinated by a shooter in LA following his victory in the Californian presidential primary.

David Kennedy, his son, died of a Demerol and cocaine overdose in a Florida hotel room in 1984, having battled addiction for many years.

Michael Kennedy, another son of RFK, died during a skiing accident in Aspen when some family members were playing football while on skis and not wearing helmets.

He crashed into a tree during the December 1997 incident and died. It happened shortly after his family's babysitter claimed he had a sexual relationship with her when she was 14.

'His track record during the past 10 
years shows the person we all know him to be - caring, generous and 
committed to his faith, family and friends.

'His
conviction was a miscarriage of justice, but that aside, his further 
incarceration would also be a miscarriage of justice in light of the 
fact that he should have been sentenced as a juvenile.'

Skakel has lost appeals challenging his conviction that raised the juvenile issue and other claims.

He
last appeared in court in January 2011, asking for his sentence to be 
shortened. A three-judge panel rejected the request, saying it was 
'unjust and excessive'.

At 
the appearance, Skakel continued to maintain his innocence, telling the 
court: 'I didn't commit this crime... give me a polygraph. I pray for 
Mrs Moxley every single day.'

Martha Moxley's mother, Dorthy, and 
brother, John, want him kept in prison for life. Skakel has shown no 
remorse, John Moxley said.

'Michael
Skakel is representative of the most dangerous aspect of our society in
that he was raised in an environment in which he was exposed to and at 
some point embraced the mindset that the rules of our general society 
did not then and do not now apply to him,' Moxley wrote in a letter to 
the parole board.

'And,
I believe that Michael Skakel's inbred sense of self and his 
self-confessed quick temper will always represent a threat to society.'

He said the murder continues to haunt him.

'No
child should ever have to witness the pain I have seen my parents go 
through, which I know in my heart contributed to my father's early 
death,' Mr Moxley wrote.

Asked about the impact of the crime, Mr Moxley added: 'When you lose a loved one, it just never goes away.'

The state Supreme Court ruled in 2010
against Skakel's bid for a new trial, saying a claim implicating two 
other men in the killing wasn't credible.

The
U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case. Skakel has a habeas corpus
appeal pending in state courts, accusing his trial attorney, Michael 
Sherman, of doing a poor job, a claim Sherman has rejected.

Skakel, who was arrested in 2000, has not had any disciplinary issues in prison, said Brian Garnett, spokesman for the state Department of Correction.

'Does Michael deserve to be paroled? Michael doesn't deserve to have been locked away for the last 10 years because he is innocent,' his brother John Skakel wrote in a letter to the parole board.

'But through this horrendous decade, Michael has been a model inmate and has chosen to use this time constructively.'
