Smiling as he leaves his local pub, Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell gives onlookers a thumbs-up, just days after he had looked looked tired and emotional before he appeared in court charged with sexual offences against a child.

The 48-year-old, who plays garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV1 series, appeared happy as he left The Railway pub, in Hale, Cheshire.

After leaving the pub on Friday he appeared to whistle and smile as he visited a bookmakers and then headed home.

On Wednesday he had stood in the dock before a packed courtroom. Appearing under his real name, Michael 
Turner, the soap star arrived for an eight-minute hearing at Manchester 
City Magistrates’ Court, just a few hundred yards from the Granada 
Studios where he has filmed for the past 30 years.

Le Vell is charged with 19 sexual offences against a child including rape, indecent assault and sexual activity.

The alleged sex offences all relate to 
one child and took place between 2001 and 2010, the court was told. Le 
Vell arrived flanked by minders and stood in the glass-panelled dock.

The father-of-two, who wore a light grey 
suit, white shirt and black tie, spoke only to confirm his name, address
and date of birth.

District Judge Khalid Qureshi asked 
Richard Gowthorpe, defending, if there was any indication of plea, to 
which Mr Gowthorpe replied: ‘No indication of plea other than the fact 
that the charges are contested, and will be fully contested in the crown
court.’

Le Vell was bailed 
on condition that he surrenders his passport, does not contact witnesses
and does not have unsupervised contact with any child under the age of 
14.

He left court looking 
tearful and distressed as members of the public looked on. The actor was
first arrested at his £750,000 home in Hale in September 
2011 after a teenage girl claimed he had sexually assaulted her.

But three months later, after a police
investigation, prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to take
the allegations to court.

At
the time Le Vell said he was ‘delighted’ to have been ‘completely 
exonerated’ and was said to be relieved he was able to continue his 
Coronation Street career.

He
thanked police for their ‘thorough investigation’ and expressed his 
gratitude to fans and the Coronation Street cast for their loyal support
during ‘a most difficult and upsetting phase in my life’. Le Vell 
returned to the show after a short break and was recently involved in 
some of its main storylines.

But last month it was announced that after a review of the 
evidence, he had been charged with 19 sex offences. At the time Le Vell,
who split from Janette Beverley, his wife of 25 years, last year, said 
he intended to fight all the charges ‘vigorously’.

Le Vell is due to appear at Manchester Crown Court this month.

A Twitter user was arrested on Friday over claims he revealed the identity of the alleged victim in the child sex case involving Le Vell.

Police said the tweet, sent on Wednesday, also contained 'personal opinion' from the sender about Le Vell's alleged victim.

Under law, victims of all sexual offences are automatically granted anonymity for life.

A 23-year-old man from Cheadle, Greater Manchester, was arrested on suspicion of publishing a name, address or photograph that would identify someone that should be anonymous.

He was held in custody for questioning and later released on bail pending further inquiries, police said.
