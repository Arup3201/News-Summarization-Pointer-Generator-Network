Gangster: Mark Duggan was lawfully shot dead by police in Tottenham, an inquest jury concluded

A member of Mark Duggan's gang threatened to murder two police officers in retaliation for the killing of the father-of-six, it was claimed today.

The gangster allegedly made the threat in the days after rioting and looting erupted on streets across the country in the wake of the 29-year-old's death.

The startling claim emerged today after an inquest concluded that Mr Duggan was lawfully shot dead by armed officers when his taxi was halted in Tottenham, north London, in August 2011.

Jurors who heard the case are now being given special protection after the gangster's family reacted angrily to their verdict.

The seven women and three men were chased from the courtroom and threatened by Mr Duggan's supporters.

Judge Keith Cutler, who presided over the case, ordered that the panel be granted indefinite anonymity and unusually their names were never read out in open court.

They were referred to by number instead and it is believed they were given a police escort from the building.

Scotland Yard last night declined to comment on any measures to protect them.

Following the angry scenes in court, riot police are bracing themselves for a fresh outbreak of disorder in London in the wake of the four-month inquest.

Tensions are likely to run high in Tottenham tomorrow when a vigil for Mark Duggan is scheduled to be held.

According to The Times, in the days after Mr Duggan's death a fellow member of the Tottenham Man Dem gang told a police officer that two policemen would be murdered in retaliation.

Just days later officers were asked to give the same man protection amid claims he could be shot or stabbed to death if he attended the wake for the father-of-six.

It is not known if police took any action on the back of the information they received and the event passed off without incident.

The gangster involved, who cannot be identified, is a wealthy businessman living in an affluent area and has never been convicted of violent crimes.

He was never named at the inquest because of data protection laws.

Police intelligence shown to The Times said that the man said two policemen would be shot as officers tried to arrest three known gang members in a black BMW in north London.

The report said: 'A large crowd gathered whilst Officers were dealing with the Males.

'[The alleged gangster] was seen nearby... [He] approached Officers and tried to engage them in conversation.

After jurors were abused following the inquest verdict on Wednesday, gangster Duggan’s fiancee Semone Wilson refused to apologise.

She also made the extraordinary claim that the jurors had been part of a conspiracy with ‘unknown forces’ to exonerate the police of any blame for his death.

Miss Wilson, 32, claimed the jeering and fury that followed the jury’s verdict of lawful killing was justified because ‘we were all angry’.

She said her family were devastated by the jury’s conclusion and accused jurors of having being ‘coached’. ‘No one in their right mind could come to that conclusion,’ she said. ‘Justice has completely failed, I have no faith in it whatsoever.
