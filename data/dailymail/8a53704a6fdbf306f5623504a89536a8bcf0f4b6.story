A 5-year-old boy was sent home on his first day of kindergarten after school officials said his hair was too long.

Malachi Wilson, who is half Native American and a member of the Navajo Nation, was dismissed from F. J. Young Elementary in Seminole, Texas for violating school policy that states boys can't have hair that is longer than the collar of their shirt, or wear ponytails.

Many Native Americans believe that hair is scared, and cutting it is a manifestation of loss.

Kicked out: 5-year-old Malachi Wilson was sent home from F. J. Young Elementary in Seminole, Texas on his first day of school because of his long hair, and told he needed to cut it to return

Heartbreaking: 'How do you explain to a 5-year-old that he’s being turned away because of what he believes in?' asked April Wilson, Malachi's mother

'After we had enrolled him he was excited. He was ready to go. Everyday it was the question, "Mom, [am I] going to school?"' his mother, April Wilson, told KOSA.

No sooner had he arrived however, than Malachi was sent home, with an order from the school's principal, Sherrie Warren, to cut his hair if he wanted to return. 

Adding insult to injury, when his mother protested his dismissal, noting her son's Native American religious beliefs, Miss Wilson demanded she show proof of his heritage.

Once she had provided formal proof Malachi was indeed Native American, he was allowed to return to school, but the young boy still seems hurt.

'It was a sad day,' he said of being sent home.

'It’s kind of heartbreaking because how do you explain to a 5-year-old that he’s being turned away because of what he believes in? Because of his religion, because of what’s part of him,' his mother added.

'Our hair is sacred to us.' 

Proof: Malachi's mother April was asked to obtain formal paperwork of her son's Navajo heritage, and bring it to the school

School policy: The Seminole Independent School District does not allow boys to have hair that goes past their collars, or wear ponytails

She said she has not ruled out filing a discrimination lawsuit against the district. 

School district officials say they followed procedure, and pointed out the rule in their handbook that says, 'certain recognized religious or spiritual beliefs may qualify for an exception from provisions of the dress code.' 

Interestingly enough, the school's mascot is a Seminole, with long hair. 

Similar case: Adriel Arocha, a member of the Lipan Apache, tribe was was also sent home from school for having long hair in 2008. His family took their case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and won

Malachi's story is very similar to that of another Texas kindergartner, Adriel Arocha, who is also Native American and was also sent home for having hair that was deemed too long by officials in his school district back in 2008.

Adriel, a member of the Lipan Apache tribe, and his family were told by the Needville Independent School District that he must either cut or conceal his hair.

The family eventually took their case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after the district refused to give Adriel an exemption for religious beliefs, and in 2010 a judge ruled in the family's favor.
