They pick locks, hang of the edge of multi-storey buildings and dash along underground rail tunnels all in pursuit of the perfect shot to post on social media.

Now the lives of Australia’s ‘urban explorers’ are the focus of a documentary that gives an insight into the controversial subculture which police claim is harming young lives, vandalising buildings and disrupting rail networks.

In Melbourne, Victoria police say trespassers were caught on the City Loop train tracks more than 1000 times in seven months last year.

'People entering the underground rail network place their lives and the lives of others at risk. We’ve seen deaths and horrific injuries as a result of people entering trains, tampering with equipment and trespassing on rail property,' a Victoria police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

Documentary maker Adrian Ortega, 23, spoke with four men involved in ‘urban exploring’ and got four  different answers about what it is, how they do it and why they do it. What they all shared was an awareness of the dangerous situations they were putting themselves in.

‘A lot of people have a different stance of what it actually is,’ Adrian told Daily Mail Australia. ‘They argue about what it is and what the structure is.’

Police are worried about a growing number of young men choosing to invade underground rail networks to take photos

Documentary maker Adrian Ortega, 23, spoke with four men involved in 'urban exploring' and got four different answers about what it is

Two men who featured in the 30-minute film, Modus Operandi: A Look Into Melbourne's Urban Exploring Scene, are secretive urban explorers who go by pseudonyms and wear bandannas over their face to avoid being identified.

They are the type of 'explorers' police are most concerned about.

Photographer RDXV runs a Tumblr and Instagram account where he shares his photos from the underground rail tunnel networks of Melbourne and Sydney.

‘The most exhilarating part is when you're down in the loop and police are coming maybe, and you don't know what it is, something could happen at any time - that's the best part about it,’ he revealed in the documentary.

‘When I was up in Sydney doing the loop my mate slipped over when a train was coming and could have been crushed by the train but he got up,’ RDXV added.

For him urban exploring is about taking photos but also ‘having fun’.

But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t get scared.

‘This one time I was with this girl on a rooftop and she climbed out on this cleaning rope support thing and was hanging there and I took a photo of her there. That was the stupidest thing I've seen anyone do, that was 20-storeys up,’ he said.

Fellow ‘tunnel rat’ nicknamed Olympic Donuts, 16, said he got into urban exploring after 'walking around suburbs and getting into sticky situations’.

‘My friends started getting into rooftops and tunnels and they got me into it basically,’ Olympic Donuts said.

Some of the men have been caught by police before while others are yet to be found

The urban explorers use whatever they can get their hands on to gain access to places they deem interesting 

'There are lots of tools to get in, coat hangers, lock picks,’ he explained. ‘You have to be stealthy, quick fast in and out, know what you are going in for.’

'If you get caught you're going to get big fines or imprisonment it's scary but it also amps you up,’ Olympic Donuts reasoned.

The other two men filmmaker Adrian spoke with are not involved with breaking into train tunnels and prefer to spend their time on construction sites and high-rise buildings.

Bryce Wilson, nicknamed the Australian Spider Man, climbs structures 300 meters above Melbourne’s CBD to document people at their best and worst.

‘It's documenting and showing people things they might never have seen before and giving them a new appreciation of the city,’ Bryce said in the film.

He doesn’t believe graffiti should be part of the unusual hobby. Although he does confess ‘the most exhilarating part is definitely avoiding police or security guards’.

RDXV believes 'the most exhilariting part is when you're down in the loop and police are coming'

'If you don't have any photos or video of it then you don't have no proof,' one urban explorer says in the documentary

'It wouldn't be urban exploring without social media... if you're doing something you need to show it off,' Olympic Donuts said

‘Bryce does it from a photojournalist view point… he’s totally against breaking into the City Link tunnels,’ Adrian explained.

When Adrian asked Bryce if he does urban exploring for the adrenaline rush, Bryce denied that was the main kick he got out of it.

Then there’s Lucas Bruce, who famously fell about 15 metres through the glass ceiling of Melbourne's Block Arcade in 2013 while ‘exploring’.

Lucas reportedly lost his footing while climbing onto a ledge and fell nine metres through the glass roof and another six metres before smashing on the ground.

‘I tried to find the most legal way into buildings... making sure the buildings are unlocked,’ Lucas told Adrian.

The urban explorers all share a head for heights but documentary maker Adrian Ortega is scared of them

Construction sites and derelict buildings are some of the favourite places for urban explorers to take photos 

Adrian was inspired to make the film after he previously documented Melbourne’s alternative nightclubbing scene and is not involved in urban exploring himself.

‘I followed a couple of the guys on Instagram… I’m afraid of heights but I got romantic and imagined what it would be like to do it.’

Asked if the men fear the police, Adrian said: ‘Two of them have been caught but the two other guys, I don't know their names, they are wearing masks and cover their identities – they haven’t been caught yet.’

Victoria police said in a statement: 'We take public safety extremely seriously and work closely with Metro Trains and other service providers to investigate and prosecute behaviour wherever and whenever it is detected.

'Depending on the incident, those detected may face serious criminal charges such as conduct endangering life and trespass.'

Police warned trespassers on the rail networks can also be charged with: 'Interfering with automatic doors of a vehicle without reasonable excuse which carries a penalty of up to $283. 

'Entering onto part of a rail vehicle not designed for carriage while vehicle is in motion which carries a penalty of up to $362. Travel on part of vehicle not meant for travel carries a penalty of up to $362. And moving, operation, interfering or tampering with equipment or vehicle without permission of an authorised adult carries a penalty of up to $362.'

Adrian Ortega's documentary Modus Operandi: A Look Into Melbourne's Urban Exploring Scene premiers on Wednesday. To find out more visit his Facebook page or website.
