Arrest: Ryan McPherson (pictured in court in 2003) was jailed over the TV series Bumfights, in which homeless men attempt amateur stunts in exchange for money, alcohol, and other incentives

Thai police have issued arrest warrants for two Americans who attempted to mail a preserved baby's head, foot and other human body parts to the United States, saying the objects were stolen from a Thai medical museum.

The bizarre case has quickly gained international attention, with Thai police asking Cambodian authorities to help locate the men, who travelled to the neighbouring country on Sunday.

The FBI is helping with the investigation in the U.S.

Police questioned Ryan McPherson, 31, and his friend, Daniel Tanner, 33, in Bangkok over the weekend but released them and allowed them to travel to Cambodia.

New evidence then emerged after their departure, prompting the arrest warrants to be issued on charges of theft, possession of stolen items and falsely declaring items on shipping documents, said police Major General Sombat Milintachinda, the head of Bangkok's police investigation bureau.

'Our evidence indicates that they either stole the body parts, or they bought them from other people,' he said. 

'We have to bring them back for more questioning.'

Yesterday, it was revealed the pair are film-makers who previously served time in prison for producing TV show called Bumfights that paid homeless men to fight each other. 

The body parts - which police believe were stolen from a Bangkok hospital's 'Museum of Death' - were stored in plastic containers filled with formaldehyde, wrapped and addressed to  Las Vegas.

DHL alerted police who tracked down McPherson and Tanner and took them in for questioning. 

They told police they had bought the body parts at a Bangkok night market - an infant's head, a baby's foot sliced into three sections, an adult's heart with a stab wound, and two slices of tattooed skin. 

The objects were preserved separately in acrylic boxes with formaldehyde.

The men told police they thought the items were 'bizarre' and 'wanted to ship them to friends to surprise them', Maj Gen Sombat and other police said.

But new details surfaced yesterday when one of Bangkok's biggest hospitals, Siriraj Hospital, said the body parts had been stolen from its anatomy museum and its forensic medicine museum - which the two men visited last week.

Surveillance video showed the pair at the registration counters of both museums on Thursday, the same day police said they arrived in Thailand, said Udom Kachintorn, the medical dean at Siriraj Hospital.  

The theft charge carries a jail term of one to five years or a fine of up to 10,000 baht (£195), while the false declaration charge carries a penalty of six months in jail and a 500,000 baht (£9,715) fine.

All three packages were being sent to Las Vegas, including one that McPherson had addressed to himself. 

Police said they contacted the FBI to get information about the would-be recipients of the items.

In Washington, FBI spokesman Minique Crump said they were aware of the matter and looking into it. 

In Las Vegas, FBI spokesman Bridget Pappas also said investigators were trying to determine whether laws had been broken by the Americans. 

The controversial film-makers, from California, produced the popular TV series Bumfights, in which homeless men attempted amateur stunts in exchange for money, alcohol, and other incentives.  

But they were arrested after the first episode, Bumfights Vol. 1 – Cause For Concern, was released on DVD in 2002 and charged with misdemeanor charges of conspiracy to stage an illegal fight and sentenced to 280-hours of community service at a homeless shelter. 

When McPherson failed to show up to the work, he was jailed for 180 days.

One of the homeless men involved in the video was even paid to have the word 'Bumfights' tattooed on his forehead.

In 2006, the filmmakers agreed to stop making Bumfights films and pay three of the homeless men featured  as part of an out of court settlement. 

The men were attempting to sue the film's producers for emotional and physical damages suffered by appearing in the Bumfights videos.

The Nation newspaper said, citing a police source, that he had left for Cambodia but promised to return to Thailand on November 25 to co-operate with police. The second man has not been identified. 

In 2012, Thai police arrested a British citizen of Taiwanese origin after discovering six human foetuses which had been roasted and covered in gold leaf stuffed into travel bags at a hotel room in Bangkok's Chinatown.

Thai detectives said they believed the corpses were due to be sent to Taiwan to be used as part of a black magic ritual.
