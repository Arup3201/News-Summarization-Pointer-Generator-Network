Williams was beaten to death with an exercise bike by fellow inmate Matthew Johnson in 2010. Johnson was sentenced to a minimum of 32 years in prison for the gruesome murder. 

Williams, known as the baby-faced killer, was a key figure in Melbourne's brutal underworld war of the 1990s and immortalised in the popular TV series 'Underbelly'.

He was a central figure in Melbourne's violent criminal war which began in the late 1990s and eventually claimed more than 25 lives, with a sentencing judge describing him as a 'puppet master' who decided who lived and who died.

Before he was killed, 39-year-old Williams had been assisting detectives with the murder of police corruption witness Terry Hodson. 

His father, George Williams, has revealed that police had been putting pressure on Williams to help with several other criminal cases. 

It is believed that if Williams had not been murdered, he may have helped to solve a number of high profile cases.
