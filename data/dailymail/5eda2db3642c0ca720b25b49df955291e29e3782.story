Liverpool's new centre-back Dejan Lovren took to Twitter to celebrate marking his Liverpool debut with a headed goal.

Lovren, who joined the Anfield club for £20million from Southampton this summer, was on target in the 13th minute, heading home a Steven Gerrard corner.

And the Croatian, Liverpool's most expensive ever defender, put in a commanding display at the back as Brendan Rodgers' side recorded a thumping win over Borussia Dortmund.

It was a perfect start for Lovren, and his celebrations, both on the pitch and on social media, showed just how much it meant to him.

The 25-year-old posted a picture on Twitter with the message 'Great start, like a dream! I hope that the whole season will be like that! #YNWA #LFC'.

The 4-0 win was LIverpool's final pre-season friendly. They begin their Premier League campaign against Lovren's old club Southampton on Sunday.
