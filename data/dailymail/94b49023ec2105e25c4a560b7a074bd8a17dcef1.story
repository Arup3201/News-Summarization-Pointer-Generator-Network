Liverpool will consider reviving interest in Wolfsburg left-back Ricardo Rodriguez if they fail to agree a deal for Alberto Moreno.

The Sevilla star has been a long-time target for Reds boss Brendan Rodgers, but a move to Anfield appears to have hit the rocks.

Up for the cup: Rodriguez is playing for Switzerland in Brazil

Liverpool thought they had thrashed out terms with the La Liga side, who have upped their asking price and are now demanding around £20million for the 21-year-old.

That means Rodgers could turn his attention to Swiss international Rodriguez instead.

The Reds were linked with the 21-year-old in January, but could reignite their interest if a deal for Moreno falls through.
