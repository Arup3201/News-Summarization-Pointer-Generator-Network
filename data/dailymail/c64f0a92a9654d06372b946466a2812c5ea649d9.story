Opposition: The findings are a setback for Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has made declining living standards of the 'squeezed middle' one of his party¿s main attacks on  the Government

Middle class families weathered the recession by shopping in cheaper supermarkets, using grandparents for free childcare and taking on extra jobs, a report published today reveals.

Households in the social group became ‘very good’ at adapting their spending and employment in order to ride out the crisis, says research by a think-tank.

Some even managed to move into a higher income bracket despite the economic downturn.

The findings are a setback for Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has made declining living standards of the ‘squeezed middle’ one of his party’s main attacks on  the Government.

Instead, data from the Social Market Foundation paints a picture of the group that has most successfully dealt with the economic fallout since the crash of 2007-8.

More women went out to work as families sought to make ends meet, with the proportion of double-income households rising from 35 per cent to 49 per cent.

An analysis of household income also found that the middle classes became bargain seekers, switching stores and hunting out cheaper deals to avoid the 25 per cent increase in food prices.

And there was also a dramatic rise in the number of people using the generosity of grandparents and other relatives to help with childcare to cut the cost of a childminder or nursery.

Middle earners are now using 20 per cent more ‘free’ care for the under-twos than they were in 2007, says the report.

Around one in five families deemed middle income in 2008 – with a net income of between £26,100 and £41,200 – fell down the income scale as a result of the financial crisis.

But two-fifths stayed where they were, and the remaining two-fifths have since climbed into the higher brackets.

Emran Mian, director of the Social Market Foundation, said: ‘Families in the middle have adapted to evade the squeeze. The super-consumers among them have beaten the market, managing their costs so that they rise by less than inflation.

‘Ed Miliband has said that the greatest challenge for our generation is restoring the living standards of the middle class, while many on the Conservative benches have been pushing for middle class tax cuts by the election.

‘In reality the middle has coped surprisingly well since 2007-08. We found that even in the teeth of the recession, two-fifths of them moved up the income distribution. Just as many managed to stay where they were.’

He added: ‘By 2011-12, the middle as a whole had the same earnings in real terms as they did in 2007-08. With the recovery under way, their prospects are likely to improve further.’

The Coalition says its economic measures – including dramatic increases in the personal tax allowance, which reached £10,000 this week – have benefited millions of middle earners.

However, interest rate rises could be a cloud on the horizon, the report suggests.

It reveals how more than half of the households in middle income brackets own their own homes, meaning that low interest rates remain critical for their ability to sustain their current standard  of living. Some 10 per cent of families in the middle also  fell behind on their rent or mortgage payments.

Mr Mian warned: ‘For the rest, the big question is whether the rise in their incomes will outpace the rise in interest rates. That’s how it looks for the moment, not least because the Bank of England is showing a high level of caution in raising rates.’
