A man who shot his own daughter on Sunday was refused the right on Thursday to attend her Saturday funeral.

Deandre Kelley, 34, was charged with reckless homicide for accidentally shooting his daughter Achauntiara 'Shanti' Lanza, 11, on Sunday but his charges were later upgraded to manslaughter. Kelley will be in prison for 17 years.

Prosecutors told the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Nadine Allen that they opposed Kelley being released from the Hamilton County Justice Center for his daughter's funeral because they feared someone would shoot him out of retaliation.

'Somebody could take a potshot at him,' Piepmeier said.

The Judge also feared for Kelley's safety and denied his request to attend him daughter's funeral, reported The Cincinnati Enquirer.

'I don’t know that we’ve ever had anyone ever ask to attend the funeral of someone he killed,' Piepmeier said. “He’s just going to have to grieve in private.'

Kelley's attorney Hugh Mckloskey asked that Kelley be able to attend his daughter's funeral with a law enforcement escort.

'We thought it was important for the family to heal and grieve together,'McCloskey said Thursday.

Prosecutors argue that Shanti wouldn't be grieving if he weren't so reckless.

The 34-year-old had been arguing with Shanti's mother, Kristina Lanza, on Sunday and didn't realize their daughter had been shot until later in the day.

Kelley, who is being held on $500,000 bond, was allegedly drunk when he arrived at the couple's Sedamsville home at about 2am.

Police say the 34-year-old Kelley fired shots into the air outside the house Sunday while arguing with the girl's mother and that one of the shots hit his daughters bedroom

Shanti was hiding in her bedroom while her parents argued outside, but she was hit by a stray bullet as Kelley allegedly fired four times into the air, police told ABC5.

Kelley's attorney, Hugh McCloskey Jr, said the death appeared to be an accident and appealed for his client to be allowed to attend the funeral for Shanti on Saturday.

'At the request of Shanti’s family, [I] filed this Motion seeking an Order from this Court allowing Mr Kelley a furlough from the Hamilton County Justice Center in order to participate, in any manner that this Court deems appropriate and under the supervision of the appropriate law enforcement,' he wrote.

Antwone Kelley said his brother had left the family's home unaware that his daughter had been shot.

'He might drink a little bit but that was his child, that was his baby. He didn't mean to do this at all. He's more heartbroken than anybody,' he said.

Emergency services were called to the house at 3am on Sunday after Shanti was found bleeding in her bedroom. She had been hit in the chest.

Her parents had been together for about 15 years, but had a troubled relationship, family members said. Kelley had been arrested for a domestic disturbance involving Shanti's mother in 2007.

Vince Lanza, Shanti’s uncle, said: 'It was one of those relationships that they can't be together but they can't be without each other.'

A fund has been set up to help the family cover funeral costs for Shanti.
