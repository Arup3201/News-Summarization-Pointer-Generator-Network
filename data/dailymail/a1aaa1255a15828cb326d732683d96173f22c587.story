Adam Barker, son of Ronnie Barker, has sold the house where he hoarded thousands of pictures of child pornography, reports suggest

The paedophile son of Ronnie Barker has sold the house where he hoarded child pornography for £550,000, reports today suggest.

Adam Barker, 45, was first arrested in June 2003 at the property in Ealing, West London. 1,675 images and videos depicting child pornography were discovered by officers.

Barker, who went on the run for eight years following his arrest, has now sold the property for £550,000 - making a profit of £450,000, The Sun reports today.

According to the newspaper, Barker bought the house in 1991 for £100,000. It is believed to have been sold two weeks ago.

The six-figure profit is in addition to the £1.4million inheritance Barker received from his late father Ronnie, who passed away in October 2005 aged 76. 

When his father passed away, he left £275,000 to be split between his three children - with the rest going to his wife Joy. Barker is thought to have never received the £91,000 he was left as he nobody knew where he was living.

When Joy died in 2011,  each of her three children received a split of her £6.5million estate - roughly £1.4million.

Barker also earns money from a company called Handles for Forks Ltd, which manages and distributes his father's work.

According to financial documents, the company has in the region of £1.3million total assets.

It was co-created in 2012 by Barker and his two siblings actress Charlotte, 50, and advertising executive Laurence, 53.

Last year, experts predicted Ronnie's family could be earning up to £300,000 per year through the business.

Barker was arrested in 2003 during a dawn raid on his home as part of Operation Ore after officers traced credit card payments he made for some of the images stored on his home computer.

At the time, he is believed to have said a detective examining the computer:  ‘You’d better take it otherwise it would a dereliction of your duty.’

Barker then went on the run for eight 
years - during which time both his father and mother died - and was 
reportedly living in Hungary.

He reportedly left a note which read: ‘Dear Mummy and Daddy. Some time ago the police came to my house looking for images of under-age children on my computer. I was arrested.

‘I must apologise for being foolish and thank you for being great parents. Rather than wait and find out what will happen, I will go away. You must understand that I won’t be able to contact you for quite some time.’

The whereabouts of the part-time actor, who appeared in Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, remained a mystery until he finally returned home to face justice, handing himself in to a police station in west London.

During his trial, Isleworth Crown court was told of the 
1,675 images and videos found at the actor's home, two were graded level
 five - the highest possible category.

A further 24 were graded level four - 
which often includes footage of child rape.

He was jailed in October 2012 after admitting 20 counts of making indecent images of children, 17 of which were of pre-teen boys.

Sentencing, Judge Rosa Dean told him: ‘Your offences contributed to the degradation and continued abuse of children.’

Speaking about a letter written by Barker’s sister to the court, the judge added his decision to flee ‘caused an unquantifiable distress to your family, and that must of course remain on your conscience.

'But for the court’s processes it means you prevented justice taking its course’.

He was released on January 22 after 13 weeks in jail.
