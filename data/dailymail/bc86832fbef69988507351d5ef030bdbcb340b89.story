Artery-opening brain stents that are designed to prevent repeat strokes in patients actually significantly increase them, scientists say.

A large clinical trial found in the first month after treatment, 
patients with the stents experienced more than twice the rate of strokes
and deaths compared to patients without them.

The results prompted the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to stop enrolling people on the U.S-wide trial in April.

Trial: Researchers followed 450 patients, half of whom were fitted with a brain stent

Now researchers are trying to 
determine what caused the increase.

Among the possibilities are blood clots forming on the 
stents or breaking loose from blood vessel walls. Damage to blood 
vessels during installation of the stents may also have been to blame.

Dr Colin Derdeyn, at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said: 'Further research may identify specific groups of patients who may 
benefit from these stents, but for now we seem to be able to save more 
lives by aggressively working to lower blood pressure and cholesterol.'

The 450 patients in the study, who were treated in 50 medical centres, had recently had strokes or temporary stroke-like symptoms associated with significant narrowing of a major brain artery.

This narrowing reduces blood flow in the brain and puts patients at high risk of additional strokes.

All patients received blood-thinning drugs and aggressive treatments to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, two key risk factors for stroke. Half of the patients were randomly selected to receive the stents in 2008.

The researchers found that nearly 15 per cent of patients treated with stents had a second stroke or died in the first 30 days after treatment, while less than six per cent in the control group had another stroke or died in the same time period.

During a nearly one-year follow-up period, 20.5 percent of patients in the stent group and 11.5 percent of patients in the control group had a stroke or died.

'The complications on the stent side of the trial were higher than we expected,' Dr Derdeyn said.

They said further research could show stents may still be the best treatment depending on whether the brain arteries were blocked with just plaque or plaque and blood.

The only FDA-approved device dedicated 
to blocked arteries in the brain is the Gateway-Wingspan system.

This 
technology allows physicians to open a blocked cranial artery by 
inserting a balloon into the artery and inflating it. Doctors then 
insert a stent to keep the artery open.

Every year over 150,000 people have a stroke and it is the third largest cause of death.

Stenosis, a blockage or narrowing of brain arteries caused by the buildup of plaques and clots, accounts for around 1 in 15 cases.

The research was published online in The New England Journal of Medicine.
