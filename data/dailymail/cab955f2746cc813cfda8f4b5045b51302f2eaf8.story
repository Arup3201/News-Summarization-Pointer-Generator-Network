President Barack Obama will make the economic recovery a focal point of his State of the Union, touting his administration's successes, while pressuring Congress to enact the types of reforms he believes will further buoy the middle class.

The Jan. 20 speech is expected to be less depressed in tone than the one he gave during the last joint session of Congress, Obama advisers who spoke to Politico indicated, and will put on a pedestal the headway the country has made in the past six years in the face of unfavorable economic winds.

'You can’t convince people that their paycheck is going farther than it was -- and you shouldn’t try. That would be a big mistake. What you can do is try to affect people’s optimism for the long term,' a senior Obama adviser told the publication.

'If we can make people understand that there are reasons for a bright future and the president has a plan to address what ails them, then that will be real progress,' the aide added.

Early drafts of the annual speech, traditionally given at the request of Congress in late January, draw inspiration from remarks the president made a month before the midterm elections at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois, speechwriters signaled.

Mostly lost to memory in the wake of a distracting line about Obama policies being on the ballot in November - a statement that haunted Democrats throughout the rest of the general election - the remarks cast a rose-colored light on America's recent prosperity and the administration that oversaw the fruition of this 'new foundation.'

'Sometimes the noise clutters and I think confuses the nature of the reality out there,' Obama said.

'Here are the facts: When I took office, businesses were laying off 800,000 Americans a month. Today, our businesses are hiring 200,000 Americans a month,' he said, reminding the audience that the unemployment rate has decreased by nearly four percent since 2009.

Continuing, Obama stated that 'over the past four and a half years, our businesses have created 10 million new jobs; this is the longest uninterrupted stretch of private sector job creation in our history.

'Right now, there are more job openings than at any time since 2001. All told, the United States has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every other advanced economy combined.

'This progress has been hard, but it has been steady and it has been real. And it’s the direct result of the American people’s drive and their determination and their resilience, and it’s also the result of sound decisions made by my administration,' he contended.

Perceptions to the contrary are not based on the facts, Obama argued.

'It is indisputable that our economy is stronger today than when I took office. By every economic measure, we are better off now than we were when I took office.

'At the same time, it’s also indisputable that millions of Americans don’t yet feel enough of the benefits of a growing economy where it matters most -- and that's in their own lives,' he stated.

The president acknowledged that 'it’s still harder than it should be to pay the bills and to put away some money' for many Americans. 'Even when you’re working your tail off, it’s harder than it should be to get ahead,' he said.

Average American families haven't increased their take home pay in nearly two decades, he said, which 'means it’s harder for middle-class Americans to climb the ladder of success. It means that it’s harder for poor Americans to grab hold of the ladder into the middle class.'

'That’s not what America is supposed to be about. It offends the very essence of who we are,' Obama said. 

'Because if being an American means anything, it means we believe that even if we’re born with nothing -- regardless of our circumstances, a last name, whether we were wealthy, whether our parents were advantaged -- no matter what our circumstances, with hard work we can change our lives, and then our kids can too.'

This year's speech, scheduled for January 20, is expected to be less depressed in tone than the one he gave last year. The president will 'try to affect people’s optimism for the long term,' a senior Obama adviser said

Back in his hometown for the remarks, Obama too returned back to the message that propelled Democrats to success in the 2012 presidential election and concurring congressional elections- economic 'fairness.'

'Our economy cannot truly succeed if we’re stuck in a winner-take-all system where a shrinking few do very well while a growing many are struggling to get by,' he told the audience. 'Historically, our economic greatness rests on a simple principle: When the middle class thrives, and when people can work hard to get into the middle class, then America thrives. And when it doesn’t, America doesn't.'

The president also used the economic thread to make the case for another one of his signature achievements: health care reform. 

'Health care has long been the single biggest driver of America’s future deficits. It’s been the single biggest driver of our debt. Health care is now the single biggest factor driving down those deficits,' he claimed.

The Affordable Care Act, Obama said, is a 'game-changer for the fourth cornerstone of this new foundation' his administration is building for America.

'America is better poised to lead and succeed in the 21st century than any other nation on Earth. We’ve got the best cards,' the president said.

'And I will not allow anyone to dismantle this foundation. Because for the first time, we can see real, tangible evidence of what the contours of the new economy will look like.' 

Obama is expected to bring back to the forefront of the political debate several policies his administration has long said would set America's economy on solid long-term footing, including new investments in infrastructure, research, early childhood education and clean energy technology.

The president will also press Congress to take up tax reforms that prevent corporate inversions, legislation to make it easier for  first-time home buyers to obtain a loan, equal pay for equal work, paid family leave and a minimum wage increase.

If the U.S. makes 'high-quality preschool available to every child, not only will we give our kids a safe place to learn and grow while their parents go to work, we’ll give them the start that they need to succeed in school, and earn higher wages, and form more stable families of their own,' Obama has said.

In the State of the Union he will likely recommit to a plan to enroll 6 million children early education programs by the end of the decade.

He's also anticipated to touch on higher education and the need for reforms that make it easier for graduates to pay off their student loans.  

Changes to the loan process will 'help a whole lot of young people breathe easier and feel freer to take the jobs they really want,' Obama told attendees of his Northwestern speech.

Another issue that is certain to come up in his address is immigration reform. 

Although the president used executive action to protect as many as 5 million illegal immigrants last month, he has continued to advocate for permanent, legislative changes to the immigration system that would provide a pathway to citizenship for illegal residents. 

Framing it as an economic boon, Obama has said comprehensive immigration reform will 'grow our economy, shrink our deficits, secure our borders.'

Obama could also use the address to lecture Wall Street in a symbolic gesture aimed at his base.

The $1.1 trillion spending bill passed by Congress and signed by the president last week that funds the federal government, with the exception of Homeland Security, through the end of fiscal year 2015 contained a provision that would weaken restrictions on Wall Street enacted in 2010 as part of Dodd-Frank.

The progressive wing of the party, led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, attempted to derail the bill over the provision, pitting the Democratic lawmakers against the White House, which came out in support of the massive appropriations legislation.

In order to make nice with the caucus, Obama may take a strong stance in favor of financial reforms that aim to rein in big banks and prevent future taxpayer-funded bailouts.

Republicans have resisted the Obama administrations efforts to slap new rules on businesses that they believe would hurt the job growth rather than help it such as a federal minimum wage increase and paid family leave. 

But the president could find a partner in the GOP, which will become the majority party in both legislative chambers next month, on less divisive issues like tax reform and other measures to rehabilitate the economy. 

'If [Obama's] willing to explain that, which he says he’s for, that would be great. Because there will be plenty of Democrats saying the opposite,' Ohio Sen. Rob Portman told Politico. 'Without his help, particularly with Democrats, it will be difficult to move that agenda that he says he’s for.'

In the last legislative session House Republicans say they passed more than 40 bills aimed at creating jobs and boosting the economy- almost all of which died in the Democratically controlled Senate. 

They plan to introduce similar legislation in the first six weeks of the year as part of their 'New American Congress' initiative.

Portman said that Obama will have to walk the walk rather than just talk the talk if he wants Demoracts - and Republicans - in Congress to adopt his priority list.

'He has every right to go out and talk about his message. But he ought to spend more time up here, working with Democrats and Republicans alike on passing items that will actually help improve the wages of middle class Americans and provide more opportunity for growth in the economy,' Portman said.
