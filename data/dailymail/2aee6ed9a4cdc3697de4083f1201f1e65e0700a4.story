A federal judge sentenced a Rhode Island lawyer to six years in prison Monday for his role in a $46 million investment fraud that preyed on terminally ill people, calling him the architect of the scheme and saying he didn't seem to recognize the harm he had caused.

Joseph Caramadre was sentenced in Providence after pleading guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy. His lawyers wanted two years in prison and two in home confinement. Prosecutors sought 10 years.

Judge William E. Smith also ordered Caramadre to perform 3,000 hours of community service to help the elderly and terminally ill.

Joseph Caramadre: A well-known Rhode Island estate planner behind an investment fraud scam that preyed on the terminally ill was sentenced to six years behind bars on Monday morning

Caramadre was a prominent lawyer and philanthropist.

Prosecutors say he and former employee Raymour Radhakrishnan illegally got personal information from terminally ill people and used it to purchase bonds and annuities that would pay out when a person died.

'You seemed to apologize that they were hurt. You don't seem to recognize that you were the one that hurt them,' Smith said at the sentencing, after Caramadre addressed the court.

The judge told Caramadre that he 
doesn't seem to realize he is responsible for 'very real emotional, 
psychological victimization' of dying people.

Behind bars: Joseph Caramadre pleaded guilty to fraudulently obtaining $46 million from insurance companies and bond issuers by stealing the identities of terminally ill individuals for a period of over 15-years

Before their guilty pleas, prosecutors told the jury that Caramadre had cooked up the idea in the mid-1990s.

He would buy variable annuities and, later, death-put bonds, both of which will pay out money, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars, if the owner passed away.

The companies that offered the services never asked if the account owners were ill, so Caramadre would take out accounts in the names of people he knew were dying.

Then he or one of the dozens of people who invested with him would collect when they died.

To find people, they placed ads in the newspaper of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence in which they offered $2,000, with no strings attached, to those who were terminally ill.

It was Radhakrishnan’s job to meet with the dying and their families to find what they called 'measuring lives' — people whose names would be attached to each account. When the person died, they would say the 'measuring life' had 'matured.'Before
the sentence was announced, Caramadre addressed the court, saying he 
'lost everything at the hands of the government and their 
investigation.'

Caramadre apologized to Judge Smith and to the families of the terminally ill. He said he designed the program as a 'win-win.'

He asked for two years in jail plus two years of home confinement.

'You were the one who was the architect of the scheme and ultimately you are the one who's responsible for the hurt and distress that's been imposed upon those individuals.'

His accomplice, Radhakrishnan was also sentenced Monday to a year and a day in prison after pleading guilty to the same charges.

Prosecutors had revised their sentencing recommendation to five years.

Radhakrishnan's lawyer, Olin Thompson, asked for just one day.

Radhakrishnan apologized to everyone he had wronged, including the families and companies. He said it was satisfying to give money to people - the way people got roped into the scheme - and acknowledged he made misrepresentations to people.

'My compassion led me to my shortfall,' Radhakrishnan told the judge. 'I did cut corners.'

Smith repeatedly asked him what he was thinking and why he hadn't asked someone outside the firm whether what he was doing was legal.

'You're smart. You're naive in a lot of ways, but you're smart. I'm trying to figure out why that bell didn't go off for you,' the judge said.

Radhakrishnan also was sentenced to six months of home confinement following his prison term.
