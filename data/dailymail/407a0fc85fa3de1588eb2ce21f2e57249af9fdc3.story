A giant swarm of blue jellyfish has invaded the pristine waters of the Gold Coast, forming a spectacular display as the mass of creatures congregated in Queensland's iconic Surfer's Paradise.

Spotted just off Narrowneck, near the northern end of Surfer's Paradise beach, the school of jellyfish extended for 50 metres in circumference.

Photographer and lifesaver Grahame Long captured footage of the blue jellyfish as he patrolled the beach, about 400 metres offshore.

“I’ve seen plenty of jellyfish around before but this was certainly the thickest I’ve ever seen, Mr Long told The Gold Coast Bulletin.

 'They were congregated in one area.' 

Local residents have reported sightings of the jellyfish for several weeks, after the swarm blew in just after Christmas.

One Twitter user labelled it a 'jellyfish explosion', while others found the idea of the swarm either 'terrifying' or 'incredible'.

Local media issued warnings for the correct treatment if swimmers were stung, urging locals to avoid vinegar and urine.

'The protocol for non-serious cases is to seek assistance from lifeguards and treat the sting with warm water until the swelling goes down, then with ice,' said Gold Coast paramedic Gary Strong.

'We do not tell people to use boiling water as the last thing we want to create is a burn,' he told The Gold Coast Bulletin.

The mass has spread out in the past day, extending from Surfer's Paradise to the Gold Coast Seaway, with some locals still concerned about being prevented from swimming in the water.

The weather will reportedly maintain its heat over the weekend, reaching up to 32 degrees.
