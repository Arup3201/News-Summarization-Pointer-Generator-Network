Cricketer David Warner has opened up about the emotional turmoil he feels every day as he continues to grieve over the devastating death of his friend and team mate, Phillip Hughes.

Hughes was tragically killed in November 2014 in a freak accident during a Sheffield Shield match at the SCG.

Warner was by Hughes' side when the 25-year-old was struck in the head by a bouncer, resulting in a catastrophic head injury. 

Warner, 28, desperately tried to help the young batsman, holding Hughes' hand as he was taken from the field.

'When I got home after that day I was standing in the shower and I was sort of facing the wall with my hands on my head going: “why?”

His fiance, former ironwoman Falzon, described her husband-to-be as a 'warrior' on the pitch but a 'softie' at home. Falzon told 60 Minutes that Warner has been 'truly inspirational'.

Four months after Hughes' distressing death, it's clear that the memories of the fatal blow and Hughes' final days are never far from David Warner's mind.

'The thought of coming off that day (at the SCG) holding his hand was…' Warner began, fading off as he was overcome with emotion during his interview with Channel Nine's 60 Minutes.

'It hurts every day when I think about it.'

Warner says that he still can't comprehend that his mate lost his life whilst playing a game.

‘It’s hard to talk about it now; It was so hard to talk about it with Candice,’ Warner told Channel 9's 60 Minutes, speaking about his fiance.

‘I turned around to Candice and said, 'Why? Why does this happen?

'Why did this happen in a game of cricket?' 

Warner broke down in tears during the interview as he tried to explain the pain of his grief, with his devoted fiancée Falzon by his side to offer support. 

Warner admits that he still battles with Hughes' death, asking: 'Why? Why does this happen? Why did this happen in a game of cricket?'

Hughes was placed in an induced coma after his accident and his loved ones held a vigil at his bedside for two days, as the country prayed for a miracle that never came. Tragically Hughes died on November 26, just three days shy of his 26th birthday. 

Just two weeks after Hughes' funeral in his NSW hometown, Macksville, the shattered Australian cricket team travelled to Adelaide to face the unimaginable task of playing again.

During the interview, Warner spoke for the first time about how it felt to step onto the pitch again so soon after Hughes' traumatic death. 

At a time when many doubted he could even face a ball, Warner scored an incredible 145 runs from 163 balls on the first day of the Test against India. 

‘Looking into the sky, looking into the stands just brought a big smile to my face thinking “I’ve done it for him, I’ve done it for my mate,' Warner said with a smile. 

He looked to the sky and put his bat in the air in acknowledgement to his late friend too

Warner's accomplishment wasn't only an amazing feat for the sport but a moving display of raw emotion. 

However, the hardest test was yet to come. 

The fourth and final Test of the series was held in Sydney, meaning Warner had to return to the SCG and play on the same pitch where his beloved 'Hughesy' was felled. 

'It is still difficult returning to the SCG,' Warner admitted to 60 Minutes.

'You take each step as it comes. But it just hits you even more, the closer you get to the wicket.'  

That day, January 6, was not only an incredible success for David Warner but a moving tribute.

He scored an emotional century on the first day of the Test against India less than two months after Hughes had been struck.

A visibly emotional Warner crouched down on the pitch, removed his helmet and kissed the turf when he reached 63 - the score which his former team-mate and friend had been on before he died.

Warner jumped into the air and looked at the sky after reaching three figures, acknowledging his fallen team-mate, as Australia played their first Test at the SCG since Hughes' death.

It was a crucial step for Warner as he grieved the death of 'Hughesy' and learnt how to love cricket again.

‘I think sometimes you need to visit these things and the only way to face it is to come face to face with it.'
