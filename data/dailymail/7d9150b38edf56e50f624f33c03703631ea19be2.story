A kindergarten teacher has been suspended from her job after two of her students were found ‘having sex’ while naked in her classroom's bathroom.

Kelly Mascio, who has been teaching for more than 15 years in Mullica Township, New Jersey, has been suspended with pay since the incident on September 30.

According to a police report, Mascio found the two five-year-olds - a boy and girl – naked in her in-classroom bathroom. They told her they were ‘having sex.’

Mascio immediately reported the incident to Principal Matthew Mazzoni, who in turn advised the Police Department and the state Department of Youth and Family Services.

The teacher was immediately suspended, while police investigated the case.

No criminal charges were filed, but on Wednesday the Mullica Township Board of Education voted to bring charges against the educator through the state to seek to remove her from her position.

In a show of support by parents in the community, about 200 people came out to support the 'much beloved teacher', reports the Press of Atlantic City.

The local Board of Education voted on Wednesday to bring charges against Kelly Mascio, who posted this message on Facebook on the very same day

‘Our main concern is that the administration has completely forgone all traditional disciplinary avenues available in handling the incident,’ said Mullica Township Education Association President Barbara Rheault.

‘The administration has selected a disciplinary route that has resulted in enormous emotional and professional turmoil, and has strained the confidence and trust of school staff, parents and community members.’

On the same day, Mascio posted the following message on her Facebook page: 'I call my students "my kids" because in out year together they aren't just kids on my class list, they become a part of my heart'.
