A bank manager who with the help of her mother fleeced friends and family of £200,000 to buy themselves a ‘happy life’ have both been jailed.

Debra Cox, 37, secretly applied for personal loans in the names of her in-laws and ‘drip-fed’ most of the cash into the account of her mother Carol Collier, 56.

Snaresbrook Crown Court heard the pair used the money to ‘enjoy the good life’ with regular holidays in the sun.

Greed: Debra Cox, left, wanted to 'buy her way to a happy life' and drip-fed tens of thousands of pounds into the bank account of her mother Carol Collier, right, which the pair used to treat themselves to luxury holidays

Cox worked as a financial planning manager then as a retail branch manager in Chingford, east London between June 2002 and September 2008.

She was later employed as a mortgage manager in central London until February 2010.

Prosecutor Michelle Fawcett said: ‘On February 9, 2010, Debra Cox was dismissed from HSBC bank for gross misconduct.

‘Four months later, her ex-husband, Dave Cox, contacted the fraud investigations department of HSBC in relation to a number of suspicious transactions identified on accounts held by his family and close friends.

‘Mr Cox identified five people that he believed had been subjected to fraudulent banking and asked for their accounts to be investigated.’

Mr Cox’s parents, Christine and Keith, were the first to fall foul of the scam, followed by his brother, Robert, and family friends Stephen and Lorraine Edwards.

‘A thorough investigation took place by HSBC with all five being interviewed,’ Ms Fawcett added.

‘In short, the investigation 
identified that Debra Cox had opened a series of fraudulent mortgages, 
personal loans and secondary bank accounts in those people’s names.

‘She
completely abused her position to continuously view the accounts of her
in-laws without their authority and arrange payments to and from their 
accounts without their knowledge, trying to cover her tracks by 
diverting all bank communication to the address of her parents.’

HSBC has since reimbursed all the victims of the fraud which ran from October 2006 to June 2010.

Defending Cox, Quentin Hunt said: ‘Beneath the veneer of prosperity, Ms Cox was significantly troubled by her criminality.

‘The motivation behind this was an attempt to buy her way to a happy life.

‘She didn’t set out to defraud her friends and family. Things spiralled out of control.’

Michael Edmonds, for Collier, added: ‘This is not a case where a plan was hatched between Ms Cox and Mrs Collier.

‘She is mortified and ashamed by the position she finds herself in.’

Jailing Cox for four years, Judge Inigo Bing said: ‘This was a serious fraud of its type.

‘You occupied a position of trust as a mortgage manager who had the responsibility of authorising loans, top-up loans and mortgages for customers, actions which would involve thousands if not hundreds of thousands of pounds.

‘But there was another breach of trust, that of your family and close friends.

‘You systematically misled them about what you were doing with their accounts and it was clear from the evidence that they felt utterly betrayed by you.

‘This was a thoroughly dishonest operation made possible by many acts of deception.

‘Your motivation was to buy your way to a happy life but another way of expressing that is greed.

‘To say this was a grave breach of trust is only to state the obvious.’

Sentencing Collier to 15 months in prison, Judge Bing added: ‘Your culpability is much lower than your daughter’s.

‘It would be a hard-hearted judge that could not have regard to the fact your husband is seriously ill and requires care, but the fact remains that you acquired £142,000 and the money was drip-fed to your bank account on 19 separate occasions.

‘Being a willing recipient of the money, you helped to conceal the fraud you knew or suspected was being conducted by your daughter.’

The pair, both of Huntsman Road, Ilford, east London, had denied the charges.

But after a four-week trial Cox was found guilty of 24 counts of fraud by false representation and two counts of obtaining money by deception.

Collier was convicted of five counts of converting criminal property and a single count of possessing criminal property.
