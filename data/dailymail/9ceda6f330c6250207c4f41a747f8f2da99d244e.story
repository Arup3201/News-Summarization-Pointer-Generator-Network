'From FIFA we are obliged to give four weeks holiday to the players, so I don't know how all that works together. It looks impossible to me.

'A post-World Cup year is always very difficult for every big club because the players have been away.'

But does he have a point? He has already revealed his World Cup winning trio of Mesut Ozil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski are likely to miss the season opener against Crystal Palace.

The club's reserve right-back is well into his pre-season preparations due to his lack of international commitments.

Many say he was unlucky not to be not he plane to Brazil, but England's loss has been Arsenal's gain.

Has lost his place in Spain's plans, but a full pre-season could help him regain his international place.

Fresh: Left-back Kieran Gibbs was not selected by Roy Hodgson for England so has had a full pre-season

Mikel Arteta - returned on July 7

His failure to secure a single cap for Spain remains a mystery, but Wenger will be glad to have his midfielder on board.

Aaron Ramsey - returned on July 7

Mesut Ozil - due back from August 11

After a inconsistent first season with Arsenal, manager Wenger would have wanted more time with his record signing during pre-season.

Olivier Giroud - Due back from August 1

The club's central striker played second fiddle to Karim Benzema at the World Cup, so should be raring to go when he reports back.

Soon to return: Olivier Giroud has yet to start pre-season with Arsenal but will join up with the squad soon
