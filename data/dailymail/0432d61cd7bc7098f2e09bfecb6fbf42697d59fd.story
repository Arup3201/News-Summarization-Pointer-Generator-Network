As if Sydney's real estate wasn't overpriced, now parking spaces are being offered with their own title for up to $330,000.

Located in the heart of Sydney's CBD, the purchaser would be paying a hefty price for a non-private, marked slab of concrete.

However the space is advertised as a bargain, boasting the ability to fit two cars and providing 24 hour access.

'VERY rarely do owners sell a car spot by itself in this building and very rarely are car spots by themselves (ie not attached to an apartment) available to be purchased on separate title!' the advertisement reads.

'Do NOT miss out on this extremely rare opportunity.'

Terence Chua, the current owner of the parking spot, told News Corp: 'It's a handy spot and it gets good rent, but most of the people interested want to use it for themselves.'

'People who live in the CBD know it's almost impossible to find permanent parking.'

Alternatives in the area include paying up to $27 an hour on a weekday, or drivers can even rent a space for about $356 per month with an additional bond of $200.

Although undeniable that parking in the CBD is hard to come by, $330,000 is more than the cost of a furnished studio apartment in the CBD.

The founder of findacarpark.com.au, Francis Armstrong, told News Corp that buying a parking space in Sydney cost an average of $73,000, with spaces in Bondi earning the highest monthly rent rate.
