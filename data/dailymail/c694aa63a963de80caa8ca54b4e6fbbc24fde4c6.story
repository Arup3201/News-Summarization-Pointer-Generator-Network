Fit Mom Maria Kang is back with a bang in her new 2015 calendar, in which she features alongside 24 'no excuse' mothers who proudly display the efforts of their intense fitness regimes. 

The 33-year-old Californian rose to fame last year after she started a Facebook campaign to try and convince mothers that they shouldn't be 'proud' about flaunting their fuller figures but should instead be proactive about trimming them down.

At the time the mother-of-three said: 'We need to change this strange mentality we are breeding in the U.S. and start celebrating people who are a result of hard work, dedication and discipline.

'I’m not bashing those who are proud and overweight, I am empowering those who are proud and healthy to come out and be the real role models in our society.' 

Maria - who was accused of ‘fat shaming’ when she posted an image of herself looking trim and toned in her workout gear, along with the caption ‘what’s your excuse?’ - has since said that it was not her intention to hurt people, but rather just to tell the truth.

As a result of the incredible reaction to her campaign, the fitness-focused entrepreneur founded a non-profit organisation aimed at encouraging mothers to take a more active interest in their personal health and exercise routines.

'The No Excuse Mom Group is a group of moms focused on growing healthily, connecting our community, leading our youth and supporting each other,' Maria writes on her website.

'We have free workout locations throughout the world. We have life, stress, work, kids, responsibilities and obligations. 

'We struggle making time for workouts, we splurge on cookie dough and enjoy (and often need) a glass of wine. That’s life. And that’s completely okay. Balance is one of the keys to success.'

The calendar, which is on sale on the group's website for $14.99, includes a whole host of nutrition tips, exercise ideas and time management suggestions, as well as four home workouts created specifically for hard-working mothers to fit into their day-to-day schedules. 

Each of the women featured are, according to Maria 'real, every day moms who transformed themselves through fitness'.

'We asked our mothers to show the world what an every day mother looks like, without covering scars, stretch marks, or cellulite,' she told Yahoo Parenting. 

'Health does not look the same on everyone, and it was important for our daughters and sons to see that beauty and fitness comes in all shapes and sizes.'

The health-obsessive claims that she has had to work hard to achieve her fit figure - and is quick to dispel the myth that it has been in any way easy for her.

'My mother has struggled with weight her entire life and when I was little (growing up and comparing my body to my 2 younger sisters) it seemed my bone and body structure was more favorable to my mom’s genetics,' she admits on her website.

'This realization made me aware of my food intake and activity output at a young age. I saw first-hand how difficult it was to deal with diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and kidney failure. 

Where it all began: Maria first rose to prominence after posting this photo of herself on Facebook

'However, let’s say I did have great genetics, I’ve always believed 30% of your body is genetic and the rest is environment. The majority of my success is based on my lifestyle.'

In addition to her roles as a mother, wife and fitness guru, Maria also owns two residential care homes for the elderly, a position which she describes as her 'passion'. 

'Residents are much like family, for they have witnessed every pregnancy and every new arrival,' she says of the job. 'I have witnessed them laugh, eventually decline and am sometimes present at their death bed.'
