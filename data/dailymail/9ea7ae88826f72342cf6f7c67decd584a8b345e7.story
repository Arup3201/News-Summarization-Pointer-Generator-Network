The multi-million pound redevelopment of the Battersea Power Station will include a viewing platform in one of the chimneys and a roof garden, it has been revealed.

Plans released by developers this week ahead of a period of public consultation show the £750million renovation will feature a huge 90,000 sq ft, or 460ft by 200ft, garden.

There will also be an observation platform at the top of 
one of the building's four chimneys, providing panoramic views across London.

Space: The development will see large areas of public green space created in the surrounding areas as well as the 90,000 sq ft roof garden, both pictured

Far from faded: The old turbine hall, pictured, will be converted into a space for small independent shops and businesses

The redevelopment will also see the creation of 200 shops, 240 apartments and office space to be used by media, design and creative industries.

The residential apartments and 
penthouses are to be built on higher floors to command the all- important Thames-side views.

The
 shops, in the old boiler house space and on lower levels,
 will be mainly independent stores - intentionally casting aside larger chains.

Full of light: The building will have large windows providing plenty of natural light

Rebirth: The latest plans for the £750m renovation, artists impressionof the entire development pictured, have been released ahead of a week-long consultation period

The detailed designs have been created by Wilkinson Eyre Architects, who have worked closely with a number of stakeholders, including English Heritage and Wandsworth Borough Council, throughout the process.

Many of the original art deco features, including parquet flooring, ornate ceilings and even power switches, will
 remain in both Battersea A station, designed in the 1930s by Giles 
Gilbert Scott, and in Battersea B, built in the 1950s as
 an extension.

Scott also designed the Bankside power station - home to the Tate Modern - and the red telephone box.

Snapped up: In January, buyers were invited to invest in 800 of the 3,400 new homes to be built on the Battersea Power Station complex, one example pictured

Changes: The overall redevelopment of the iconic building is being overseen by Rafael Vinoly - who designed the 'Walkie Talkie' building

Rob Tincknell, chief executive of Battersea Power Station Development Company, said: 'It’s really important to everyone involved in this incredible project that we get the restoration and future use of the power station exactly right.

'We feel that what we are proposing retains and respects the integrity of this historic landmark whilst also creating vibrant living, working and recreational space that this part of London needs.'

The latest plans are just part of a huge redevelopment of the entire 
Battersea complex, which will include more homes, offices and 
shops on the unused land.

Rafael Viñoly designed the mixed-use masterplan, which includes more than 3,400 new homes as well as offices, shops, restaurants, bars, cafes, hotels, community and leisure space and 18 acres of open space.

Development: Vinoly's masterplan will see the creation of new homes offices, shops, restaurants and hotels

Turbulent: Throughout the years Battersea Power Station, seen in the top left of this photo among many of London's top attracitions, has been rumoured to become a Disneyland, a nightclub and a football club

Last month, it was announced that Frank Gehry - regarded by many as the world’s most innovative architect - would jointly design part of the landmark project with British architect Lord Foster.

In January, buyers were invited to register their interest in some 800 of the site's apartments, some of which cost up to £6million for a penthouse suite.

The power station has seen a series of unsuccessful redevelopment efforts since it was de- commissioned thirty years ago.

In 1987, work began on an indoor theme park, but soon stopped due to costs.

Hong Kong-based consortium Parkview International bought the site in 1993, and began a series of schemes and planning applications.

Then, in 2006, Real Estate Opportunities (REO) plc, majority-owned by Irish developer Treasury Holdings, purchases the site and appointed  Rafael Viñoly’s practice to devise a new master plan.

Men at work: The first two chimneys were completed in 1939. By 1955 the third and fourth chimneys were completed making the Power Station the largest brick building in Europe

The Borough of Wandsworth granted planning for a development of 7.9 million sq ft – one of the largest planning consents granted in central London - in 2006.

However, following the collapse of the Irish real estate market in 2010, the Irish agency NAMA and Lloyds TSB foreclose on REO loans and administrators Ernst & Young (E&Y) were appointed.

Finally in June 2012, it is announced that SP Setia and Sime Darby have entered into an exclusive agreement with Ernst & Young, NAMA and LloydsTSB to purchase Battersea Power Station.

Wandsworth Council greeted the announcement by stating that the deal was 'very good news.'

Before: The Power Station used to be a major source of energy for the capital soaking smoke into the street

1926: The site of a super-station at 
Battersea is first mooted, with its proposed location causing a storm of
 protest. Plans are approved by Electricity Commissioners the following 
year.

1930: Battersea A, the first of the two adjacent power stations
 begins to take shape. Architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott is appointed 
and tasked with connecting Battersea Power Station’s architectural 
features. The steel frame is enveloped in a brick skin and the chimneys 
pre-cast in concrete. Distinctive fluting is designed for the brick 
cladding and chimney bases.

1933: The first two 69MW generating units
 in Battersea A begin operating. Two years later, a further 105MW 
generating set completes Battersea A. Design and presentation throughout
 the finished building reflects its eminent position in the industry.

 Construction begins on Battersea B. With war imminent, brick and 
concrete covers are constructed for the turbo– alternators and shelters

the last 100MW set commissioned the overall capacity is 509MW. Battersea
