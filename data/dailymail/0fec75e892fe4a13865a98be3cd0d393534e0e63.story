Tens of thousands of disgruntled Australians have voted with their feet on Sunday, marching in protest against the Federal Government's unpopular budget.

More than 10,000 people gathered in Sydney alone, where they walked from the CBD's Belmore Park to Broadway, railing against cuts to essential services and objecting to Tony Abbott's stance on human rights, the environment and industrial relations.

The backlash against the PM and his government was also trending on social media, with people taking to Twitter to vent their anger.

Sunday's events coincided with an emergency meeting between state and territory leaders, which was ordered to discuss the $80 billion in cuts to health and education spending planned over the next four years.

The meeting resulted in every single one of the nation's premiers, except Western Australian Colin Barnett, demanding an urgent discussion with the Prime Minister over the cuts.

Speaking with MailOnline, national event organiser and spokesperson of the March in May event, Loz Lawrey, said the mass rallies provided an opportunity for people to stand-united against Tony Abbott's 'attack' on ordinary Australians.

He said protesters were most concerned with the axing of health and education funding and the thousands of jobs cut from the public sector.

Hikes in university fees and the Medicare co-payment were also deeply unpopular issues.

Many protestors were wearing black “F*** Tony Abbott” T-shirts that were on sale for $25 each at the Sydney rally.

In other parts of the country, some 5,000 people supported a no-confidence motion in the Abbott government as they gathered in Adelaide's city centre, while a smaller gathering of 600 gathered in Brisbane's Queens Park, next to the Treasury Casino.

Activist Luke Rogers told the crowd at the Adelaide rally that today's protests would send a message  'that enough is enough.'

'We are here today as we were here in March, and as we will be in August, to express a vote of no confidence in the current government.'

The event in Sydney was a politician-free zone, with offers by the Greens, the Labor Party and the Socialist Party to speak at the rallies turned down by organisers.

Crowds began to swell at Belmore Park from 1pm and by 2.45pm there were around 8000 protestors ready to make their voices heard, according to police estimates.

Call for help: Sunday's events coincided with an emergency meeting between state and territory leaders, which was ordered to discuss the $80 billion in cuts

The demonstrators marched to Victoria Park, watched carefully by the cops, and arrived about 4.30pm.

Some of those that disobeyed police directions to stay on the planned protest route were arrested.

One of the Sydney protestors, Blacktown resident Michelle Konnecke. said she wanted to show her frustration about GP co-payments.

The health changes mean seeing a doctor who previously bulk-billed (or accepted the relevant Medicare benefit as full payment for their service) will now cost $7 instead of no fee.

Not happy: Police estimated 8000 people were present in Sydney's Belmore Park by 2.45pm

It is one of the most controversial announcements in the Federal Budget and will affect the 80 per cent of GP consultations that are currently bulk-billed.

Ms Konnecke wore a home-made placard, which said: 'This sign is too small to list all their broken promises.'

'This is only the second time we've come to a protest and we just decided to make a sign to make our voice heard. It's my daughter's and granddaughter's future we're talking about,' she told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Greens leader Christine Milne told AAP she was overwhelmed by the ground swell of anger across the country over the budget.

'He's (Tony Abbott) relying on the Senate caving in ... But we will not support these vicious cuts to young people, welfare recipients and the sick.'

Australian Services Union's NSW and ACT secretary Sally McManus said the prime minister wanted to abolish fairness, equality and checks and balances for big businesses.

'You're a liar, a wrecker and a divider of our country,' she told the crowd.

Others who took to the microphone in Sydney were Greenpeace Australia CEO David Ritter, journalist Antony Loewentstein and indigenous poet Ken Canning.

Mr Lawrey said today's march was not a place for people to push their political persuasions, but an opportunity for people to to band together to air their grievances.

There were some colourful, and at times distasteful, references made about Mr Abbott and the Treasurer Joe Hockey throughout the Sydney march, including a placard which referred the Prime Minister as both 'the Lying King', and a 'Liar, liar, speedos on fire'.

Unemployed protestor Florentina Pergoleto, 23, from Alexandria, was marching for the first time.

She told The Daily Telegraph: 'I feel a lot of the government’s policies exclude the working class and those who are less fortunate.'

She wore giant cardboard ears which featured the words 'Phony Tony'.

The rallies were a sequel to the March in March protests held earlier this year.
