Tristan worked on school nights and weekends to earn all 54 badges

A 10-year-old boy was today hailed Britain's most dedicated Cub Scout - after earning all 54 badges in just two years.

Tristan Gee has achieved one new badge every two weeks since he joined his troop in 2010 and has so many he almost ran out of space on his cub jumper.

The schoolboy joined just a handful of other cubs in Britain to complete every badge and was awarded his last one - map reading - on his final ever meeting before joining the Scouts this week.

He first joined Romsley Cub Scouts, in his home town of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, when he was eight and set himself the challenge of earning every badge.

He had to work almost every school night and weekend to achieve his goal.

On Sunday, Tristan was presented with a special neckerchief and the Chief Scout's Silver Award - the highest award available to cubs - in honour of his remarkable achievements.

Tristan said: 'It was phenomenal to do it really. I'm amazed that I've done this.

'Martial arts was the hardest because I don't like it much. Ice skating was another hard one.

'My friends and other Cubs think it's amazing too. I think I will try and do all the Scout badges now.'

Tristan's diverse range of badges include those for map reading, DIY, martial arts, cycling, music, IT, swimming and horse riding.

He has completed all 33 activity badges, all seven challenge badges and has 13 stage badges from the six categories.

The 10-year-old almost lost out on his 
dream when he struggled to perfect ice skating - falling more than 20 
times on his first lesson.

Tristan's mother Kathryn (pictured left) said she was 'proud' he earned all the badges (pictured right)

But after hours of practice he passed with flying colours, achieving a level three when he only needed a level one.

His mother Kathryn said Tristan's father Paul, 43, and his sister Felicity, nine, were proud of him and he deserved the award.

The 40-year-old personal assistant said: 'Tristan has been a cub since he was eight and it has taken the whole of cubs to complete the badges.

'He decided when he went there to try 
and do it because he likes to achieve, he's quite a high achiever and it
was something to keep him motivated.

'He was really focused and he was doing it every night and weekend after his school homework.

'It is a very difficult thing to achieve, due to the range of badges that are available.

'The ones that have been the most difficult are the sport ones because he had to learn them.

'Things like martial arts and ice skating have taken a lot of commitment. He couldn't stand up when he started ice skating but now he can do it.

'I wanted to prove to him that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.

Medals: Tristan got more than just badges for his swimming achievements

'He did the last badge at the weekend on the last Cub camp and he started Scouts on Monday.

'They are already starting on badges so he is happy with that. I think he will give it a go to get all the Scout badges too.

'He has had to learn a lot of skills that didn't come naturally to him. It's sheer determination and hard work.

'We are all so proud of him.'
