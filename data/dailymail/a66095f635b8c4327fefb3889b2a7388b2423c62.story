The appearance of two rare sea serpents washing ashore beaches on the Southern California coast in the past week has prompted fears it could be a sign that a natural catastrophe is coming.

The giant oarfish were dead when they washed up on land, and some scientists believe they come ashore to die because they are ‘in distress’.

The first sea monster, measuring 18 feet, was discovered by a woman snorkelling off the coast of Catalina Island on October 13. It took 16 people to drag it up onto the beach.

The second silvery creature, measuring almost 14 feet, came just a few days later on October 18 in Oceanside, California.

Rare: This snakelike oarfish measuring nearly 14 feet long was found on a beach in Southern California on October 18. Speculation is rife over whether the sightings prelude an earthquake

Oarfish, which can grow to more than 50 feet in length, are considered the longest bony fish in the world.

They
 typically dive more than 3,000 feet deep, which makes sightings rare 
and has fueled various serpent legends throughout history.

According
 to traditional Japanese folklore, oarfish rise to the water’s surface 
before an impending earthquake. Scientists speculate it is because the 
bottom-dwelling fish are more sensitive to seismic shifts.

In
 2011, just a few months before a magnitude 8.9 earthquake hit northeast
 Japan, over a dozen oarfish, known as ‘ryugu no tsukai’ in Japanese, 
either washed ashore or were caught in fishing nets in the Ishikawa, 
Toyama, Kyoto, Shimane and Nagasaki prefectures near the quake’s 
epicentre.

Scientists, however, say there is no data to support an actual link between the two phenomena.

Rick
 Feeney, who has been studying fish for almost 35 years for the Natural 
History Museum of Los Angeles County, told CBS Los Angeles that the two 
sightings this week in California were ‘probably just a coincidence’.

‘We
 think that they come inshore to die actually because they’re in 
distress for some reason, but we don’t know what the reason is,’ said 
Feeney, adding that the fish could have been starving or disoriented.

The
 obscure fish that were found last week apparently died of natural causes and tissue samples and 
video footage were sent to be studied by biologists at the University of
 California, Santa Barbara.

According
 to Feeney, four sightings have been reported since 2010 from the 
Central Coast southward, including in Malibu in 2010 and Lompoc in 2011.

In
 March 2012, fishermen in Japan reported a sharp increase in oarfish 
sightings following the massive magnitude-8.8 earthquake in Chile that 
same month, which marked almost exactly one year before the country was 
devastated by its own magnitude-8.9 quake in northeast Japan.

The
 belief that animals can predict earthquakes and other natural disasters
 – and even the weather - has been around for centuries.

Issues in the deep: Scientist Rick Feeney says they believe the oarfish come up to the water's surface to die 'because they're in distress'

A mystery: Oarfish dive more than 3,000 feet deep, sightings of the creatures are rare and they are largely unstudied

In 373 
B.C., historians recorded that animals, including rats, snakes and 
weasels, deserted the Greek city of Helice in droves just days before a 
quake devastated the place.

Accounts
 of similar animal anticipation of earthquakes have surfaced across the 
centuries since, such as catfish moving violently, chickens that stop 
laying eggs and bees leaving their hive in a panic, according to National Geographic News.

Precisely
 what animals sense is a mystery, but one theory is that wild and 
domestic creatures feel the Earth vibrate before humans. Other ideas 
suggest they detect electrical changes in the air or gas released from 
the Earth.

Earlier 
this year, a record number of sea lion sightings were reported along 
Southland beaches, including one declared ‘unusual mortality event’ in 
April that saw hundreds of ailing sea lion pups washed ashore.

Only time will tell if any of these strange occurrences mean anything.

The giant oarfish 
was first discovered in 1772 by Norwegian biologist Peter Ascanius. Its
 formal scientific title is Regalecus glesne, but the fish is also known
 as king of the herring, Pacific oarfish, streamer fish and ribbon-fish.

The longest recorded specimen clocked in at 26 feet, however, the species is believed to grow as long as 50 feet and weigh as much as 600 pounds.

Like
 the equally mysterious giant squid, the oarfish would go on to enchant 
fisherman and sailors and inspire stories of sea monsters.

The fish lives at extreme ocean depths, between 656 feet (0.2 kilometers) and 3,280 feet (1 kilometer) deep.

In 1996, a group of Navy Seals found a 23-foot long oarfish off Coronado, near San Diego, California.
