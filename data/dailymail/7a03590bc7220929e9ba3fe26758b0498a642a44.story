Actor Danny Dyer is set to come face-to-face with the comedian who ridiculed him  in a series of hilarious adverts – after both landed parts on BBC soap EastEnders.

Dyer, 36, takes over as landlord of the Queen Vic at Christmas, while comedian Terry Alderton – who played ‘Danny Dire’ in the Virgin Media adverts, parodying Dyer’s TV shows Deadliest Men and The Real Football Factories – joins the series as Bianca Butcher’s cab driver brother Terry.

Alderton’s impression of Dyer portrayed him as a fool with an exaggerated Cockney accent and a speech impediment, swaggering around East London.

Another episode saw Alderton lost in  Switzerland where he said he needed his mum, before announcing he was expecting ‘trouble’ while standing in an almost empty town square.

Both men are signings for new EastEnders producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who is attempting to reverse the show’s ratings decline behind ITV’s Coronation Street and Emmerdale.

BBC bosses believe Dyer will prove hugely popular with fans and are planning major new storylines for his character Nick Carter – brother to Shirley Carter – and wife Linda, played by Kellie Bright.

Danny will be well known to moviegoers as he has starred as a Millwall football hooligan in gritty English film Football Factory and as late-night party animal 'Koop' in Human Traffic.

As well as producing several TV series, parodied in the Virgin Media adverts, Dyer has also appeared on TV quiz show panels and plays celebrity DJ slots in clubs across the UK.
