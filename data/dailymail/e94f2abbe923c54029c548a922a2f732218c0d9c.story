These horrific pictures show the aftermath of a high speed police car chase which somehow left only one person injured.

The collision, in the early hours of this morning, saw a Mini collide with a VW Golf and a Mitsubishi before hitting a wall and flipping on to its roof, police said.

Amazingly the only person hurt was the driver of the Mini, who was taken to hospital with a broken collar bone. 

Carnage: A Mini (pictured) driven by a 30-year-old woman hit a wall and flipped on to its side after colliding with a VW Golf and a Mitsubishi

This VW Golf, which is understood to have been parked at the time of the crash, was severely damaged

Officers chased the Mini after it was seen at speeds of 80mph while driving 'erratically and with no lights on' moments before the crash in the early hours of this morning in Oldham. 

It is understood that both the VW Golf and the Mitsubishi were parked when the Mini, driven by a 30-year-old woman, collided with them on Middleton Road in Chadderton.

Police, ambulance and fire crews were scrambled to the scene at around 3.45am but the woman had freed herself by the time they arrived.

She was breathalysed at the scene and taken to hospital with non life-threatening injuries, a spokesman for Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.  

He added that the woman had not been arrested but may be summoned to a police station at a later date.

The road was still closed at 7.15am while officers cleared the wreckage but it has since reopened.

'A short pursuit took place, before the woman driving the car, a BMW Mini, on Middleton Road, collided with two other cars, a VW Golf and a Mitsubishi, before colliding with a wall.

'The woman was taken to hospital to be treated for an injury, but it is not thought to be life-threatening.'
