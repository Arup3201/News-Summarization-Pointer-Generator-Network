A domestic dispute turned deadly when a crazed husband shot his wife and two daughters at home before turning the gun on himself, police said.

The mother called 911 in Houston, Texas, on Sunday after being shot by husband Sardar Shaikh, 43, police said, over an alleged financial dispute.

Mr Shaikh and his daughter Jacqueline Shaikh, 12, were dead when police came, but the wife and daughter Vivian Shaikh, 14, were taken to hospital.

Fatal: A father shot himself after shooting his wife and two daughters, killing himself and his 12-year-old daughter. His wife and 14-year-old daughter survived

Sisters: Vivian Shaikh, 14, left was taken to hospital in Houston, Texas, and is in a critical condition, but Jacqueline Shaikh, 12, right, was dead when police came

‘He lost a job and everything,’ 
neighbour Harold Portillo said, suggesting the man was under financial 
strain. ‘So he was behind two months’ rent.’

The mother, Maria Isabel Groena, 43, was left paralysed while Vivian survived a gunshot wound to the neck but both remain in critical condition.

While doctors fight to keep the pair 
alive at the Ben Taub General Hospital in Houston, police are struggling to find an
explanation to the shooting.

The progress of investigators is being
held back because they haven’t been able to contact any next of kin or 
family members, police said.

The weapon: The man shot himself outside their apartment and landed on the gun

‘Witnesses who we've talked to at the 
scene are not saying anything (that) indicates there was something that 
precipitated this,’ a police spokesman said.

One report suggested that Mr Shaikh was under great financial strain, and was recently fired from his job.

While there were no prior domestic disturbance reports to the address, some give hints to problems at home.

‘I knew they had problems, but not 
that bad,’ local store owner Adam Dalami said. ‘Beautiful family, nice 
family. It never seemed that bad.’

Trouble at home: The shooting happened at their Houston, Texas, apartment

Cause: While there is no record of prior domestic disturbance calls to the address, one friend said that they were in financial trouble

An eyewitness saw Mr Shaikh fall after he shot himself outside of the apartment complex, and she rushed up to perform CPR.

‘It was just, I think a natural reaction, I work at a hospital,’ medical assistant Jaculynn Jackson said.

‘I saw him collapse. I ran over to 
give him CPR and he was lying on top of the gun. They were saying he 
shot himself in the head.’
