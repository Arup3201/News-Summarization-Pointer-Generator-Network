Curiosity may have killed the cat but it caused just a little bit of embarrassment for this inquisitive cow.

The animal got its head stuck in a tree in the middle of a field in Monkmoor, Shropshire, yesterday afternoon.

It took a team of six firefighters from Shropshire Fire and Rescue an hour-and-a-half to free the young bullock.

Trapped: The bullock with its head stuck in the tree in the field in Shrewsbury. It later had to be rescued by the fire brigade using a specialist animal harness

Emergency workers initially tried to free the
animal using strops but were forced to admit defeat and use a harness 
and a crane instead.

Pictures taken at the scene show the team of firemen gathering around the hapless cow with specialist animal rescue equipment.

After being winched up and released 
from the tree, the animal was said to be distressed but uninjured and 
was later reunited with it's herd in a nearby field.

Neil Grove, Shrewsbury station manager for Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'It was a very strange incident indeed.

Rescue mission: Five firefighters surround the bullock as it is fitted with the specialist harness and attacked to a crane. The bullock was later lifted up and released from the tree distressed but uninjured

'What he was looking for, I don’t know
and we don’t know how long he was in there. Manual lifting didn’t work 
because of the way his head was trapped.

'It's normal to cover animals’ heads 
during rescues to keep them in the dark for as long as possible - 
because this helps them to stay calm.

'But on this occasion, with the cow’s 
head in the tree it was not really necessary. His head was in the bottom
of the tree which was quite dark.

'He was relatively calm while we were 
there. The cow ran off once we got him out – he didn’t stay around to 
thank us. He was bemused but appeared uninjured.'

A spokesman for Shropshire Fire and 
Rescue Service added: 'On arrival the officer in charge 
assessed the situation and attempts were made initially to release the 
animal using strops and various equipment from the Shrewsbury 
appliance.

'These attempts proved unsuccessful, 
so a specialist large animal harness, with a quick release mechanism, 
was used in conjunction with the Hiab crane on the rescue tender.

'The cow was successfully lifted up and released from the tree.'
