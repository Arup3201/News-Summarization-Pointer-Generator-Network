Dozens of diners lunching at a Houston restaurant were left terrorized Wednesday after a SUV stormed through the window from the car park and mowed down customers.

The terrifying incident, captured on video from the eatery's surveillance system, occurred at DiMassi's Mediterranean Buffet in the city's southwest about 1.55pm - peak lunch hour.

Ten people were injured in the crash, with four of them rushed to hospital, including one man, who was thrown from the window where he was sitting across the restaurant and pinned underneath the car.

The female driver, who was not arrested, allegedly told authorities she mistook the accelerator for the brake, according to NBC News.

Calm before the crash: This is the moment the SUV (back left) approaches the window of DiMassi's Mediterranean Buffet on Wednesday as unsuspecting diners eat

Smash: The SUV comes crashing through the restaurant, hurling two men forward who were sitting against the window

Scary: The car only increases in speed once it gets inside, collecting more customers

Scattered: Diners run for their lives as the car approaches

Lucky escape: The SUV only narrowly misses the two

Safe: The man grabs for his partner as he takes cover and she runs

The owner, Eihab Aldaqamoni, said the roar of the car plowing through the restaurant was so loud he thought it were an airplane on top of the roof. 

The vehicle only came to a stop when it crashed into the buffet counter.

It narrowly missed an elderly couple who were getting food from the buffet at the time.

Scarily the incident didn't end there.

The driver, somewhat dangerously, backed up the car in the restaurant.

However the SUV again propelled forward and crashed into the counter.

On the ground at the time struggling to get up from his injuries was a man, identified as a local banker.

Not over: The car backs in the eatery before hurling forward for a second time

Smash: The SUV hits the buffet a second time. A man is pinned underneath

Help: An injured diner is helped up from under the buffet and debris after being pinned by the car

Driver: The female behind the wheel reportedly told authorities she mistook the gas for the brake. She was not arrested

Scene: The car propelled through the windows of DiMassi's Mediterranean Buffet in Houston

The man was helped up by workers and other customers, and could be seen in the video footage as bleeding from his arm.

'Can you imagine how scary it was, all those people eating, enjoying themselves,' customer Sally Bejarano told KHOU. 

Four ambulances, two fire engines and two other units from the Houston Fire Department responded. 

The driver could be seen talking to police at the scene.

However she was not arrested and no charges have yet been laid.  

'As you see in the video, she came in and started going faster, so she said she hit the gas instead of the break,' said Aldaqamoni. 

'I would never imagine something like that happen,' said Aldaqamoni.
