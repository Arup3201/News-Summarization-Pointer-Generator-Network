A landmark budget agreement that passed in the U.S. House on Thursday faces certain death in the Senate unless at least five Republicans step up to support it – but so far there are no takers at all.

The GOP's Senate leaders plan to launch a procedural effort to kill the plan over a laundry list of objections – including a claim that it short-changes military veterans and other government retirees.

Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin conceded that he needs to find Republicans who will vote for the measure after Republicans announced their intention Thursday night to block the deal.

'We need Republican votes to pass the budget agreement, period,' Durbin told reporters on Thursday. 'We need at least five. And I’m hoping that there will be more than that.'

Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and the third-most powerful Senate leader, acknowledged that 'there are not five Republicans who have announced they’re for it.'

In fact, no Republican senators have publicly said that they will vote in favor of the agreement that Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray unveiled Tuesday evening.

Turtle in the headlights? Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is on the hot seat as his caucus prepares to fight against the budget agreement that the House passed easily Thursday night

No way, Jose: Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative tea-party darling, said the budget proposal 'spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare. I cannot support it'

Their plan would roll back 
$63 billion in mandatory cuts from the so-called budget sequester that took effect in March. Some of that restored spending 
would be offset by cuts to military and civilian government pensions.

Annual cost-of-living increases in most military veterans' retirement benefits would be cut by 1 per cent, an amount that the Military Officers Association of America says could cost a typical former soldier or sailor $80,000 over a 20-year period.

The GOP's three most senior senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have announced that they will vote 'no.'

Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, all considered top-tier presidential contenders in 2016, are all lined up against the measure.

The proposal 'spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare,' Cruz said Thursday. 'I cannot support it.'

Gang of two: House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray negotiated a shutdown-averting agreement that could be headed nowhere

Rubio emailed supporters on Wednesday, saying that the agreement Ryan and Murray negotiated over a six-week period 'continues Washington's irresponsible budgeting decisions by spending more money than the government takes in and placing additional financial burdens on everyday Americans.'

House Speaker John Boehner fanned the flames of a civil war inside the GOP by slamming conservative groups that opposed the budget deal -- but it could all be for nought if his Senate colleagues decide to kill it

And Paul said in a statement that the March sequester cuts 'were not nearly enough to address our deficit problem. Undoing tens of billions of this modest spending restraint is shameful and must be opposed.'

Other Republicans who face primary challenges from tea party-backed candidates are also vowing to cast 'no' votes.

'After careful review of the agreement, I believe it will do disproportionate harm to our military retirees,' South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said in a statement.

'Our men and women in uniform have served admirably during some of our nation’s most troubling times. They deserve more from us in their retirement than this agreement provides.'

Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, echoed Graham's complaint.

'I do not support paying for increased federal spending on the backs of our retired and active duty troops,' Wicker's Thursday statement read. 'Congress should not change the rules in the middle of the game for those who have chosen to serve our nation in the military. ... The plan should be rejected.'

Other Republicans object to what one GOP Senate staffer told MailOnline is the agreement's 'pixie dust approach to budgeting.'

'We're doing what we always do,' said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'We set out a ten-year plan while knowing full well that we have a decade to undo it and shift gears again.'

Looking toward 2016: Sen. Rand Paul said the unpopular 'sequester' budget cuts 'were not nearly enough to address our deficit problem' and should never be rolled back

Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions explained that Democrats will need 60 'yes' votes – on two separate procedural ballots – in order to pass it.

The GOP's parliamentary roadblocks will have the same effect as a traditional filibuster without consuming countless hours of Senate time when the measure is considered early next week.

Even if Senate Democrats manage to find enough Republican support to pass the agreement, it won't have the force of law.

What Ryan and Murray proposed Wednesday is merely a framework for a budget that has yet to be written. Members of Congress who sit on appropriation committees will still be required to craft – and pass in both houses – a final budget bill by January 15.

Unless they can pull it off, the federal government will be headed for its second shutdown in three months.
