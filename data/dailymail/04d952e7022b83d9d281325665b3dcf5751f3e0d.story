Queensland police will deploy so-called 'sonic cannon' devices at the G20 at the weekend, although they insist they will not be used as a 'force option'. 

According to a Fairfax Media report, police currently own two Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) models, which are capable of blasting clear sound in a fixed direction for up to two kilometres.

G20 protest organisers said they were baffled several weeks ago when police offered to show them the 'ludicrous' hardware at a police training academy.

'We just thought it was bizarre,' said Adrian Skerritt, the spokesman for the BrisCAN group, which is expecting several thousand protesters to turn out for a rally on Saturday. 

Mr Skerritt said the device was 'absolutely silly'. 'It's a ludicrous thing, that they have such a vehicle.... It won't be used. They know it won't be used.' 

A police spokesman described the devices as 'acoustic hailing devices' and said they are regularly used by negotiators.

'The devices may be used at G20 for communication with large crowds,' the spokesman told Daily Mail Australia. 

'Under no circumstances will they be used as cannons or as a use of force option. '

The cannons were deployed to disperse a crowd protesting the G20 conference in Pittsburgh in September 2009. 

Around 6000 police, many who have travelled from other parts of the country, will be on call throughout the summit.  

Daily Mail Australia understands the Queensland Police Special Emergency Response Team purchased the LRAD devices some time ago. 

Police reported the first major security breach of the protests on Tuesday when they reported the discovery of two hidden projectors that were reportedly set to beam the message 'G20 1 per cent' on to walls in Brisbane's CBD.

Mr Skerritt, 46, who has attended protests in the city for the past two decades, said his town has been 'militarised' in recent days. 

'There's been helicopters over the skies over the last couple of months. It's an extraordinary waste of the public's money.'
