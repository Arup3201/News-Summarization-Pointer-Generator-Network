Questions: Prince Andrew ended trip with a visit to Eugenie in New York

Royal globetrotter Prince Andrew has come under fire after taking his daughter Eugenie to dinner in New York during an official world tour, which has been partly funded by the taxpayer.

The prince, nicknamed Air miles Andy for his habit of taking long-haul flights at the public's expense, is currently on the final leg of a three-week, 21,258-mile ‘official’ 
trip.

He took Eugenie, 
23, who has moved to the city 
to work for a year for an online auction company, out for dinner at ABC Kitchen on Wednesday night.

The palace has insisted that his primary reason for being in New York was to attend a Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Coast Guard and Airmen's Club ball.

The Queen’s son, 53, was forced to give up his formal role as a
UK trade ambassador after a string of scandals.

He is the only member of the royal family who refuses to publicise 
his foreign travel in advance.

A spokesman for the Duchess told the Daily Telegraph: 'Their schedules worked so they were both able to be there at the time Eugenie was moving to New York.

'If the Duke was there at the same time it would have have been because he wanted to be there when his daughter was moving away for a year.'

The Prince had four days of official engagements while visiting Indonesia and 
Vietnam, but also managed a further eight days designated 'private time'.

The
first leg of his tour of the Far East was funded in full by taxpayers, 
Buckingham Palace admitted last night. A one-way-business class ticket 
would cost at least £5,000.

In both Tokyo and New York his expenses –
including travel and accommodation – were in part subsidised by a 
private defence think tank which has appointed him to its board of 
‘International Advisors’, the Mail has learnt.

Founded in 1831 by the
Duke of Wellington, the Royal United Services Institute is a respected 
independent, not-for-profit research body offering expert opinion on 
defence, security and terrorism.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman insisted the remaining cost of the trip were paid for by the Duke Himself.

The Palace declined to comment on his meeting with Eugenie describing it as a 'personal matter'.

'Air miles' Andy: The Queen's son, 53, was forced to give up his formal role as a UK trade ambassador after a string of scandals

Andrew flew out of the UK – accompanied by a team of 
round-the-clock, publicly-funded police bodyguards – on September 16 to 
Jakarta, where he stayed for three days.

The visit was, apparently, 
designed to promote ‘UK bilateral relations including in trade and 
investment, science and innovation as well as education’.

He attended
a dinner at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, opened the new British Embassy and 
attended a launch of a Government-backed tourism initiative.

Palace officials confirmed last night 
that this leg of his journey was approved by the Royal Visits Committee 
at the request of the Foreign Office, which means that all his travel 
costs, hotels and expenses are met by taxpayers out of the Queen’s 
Sovereign Grant.

One-way business class flights to Jakarta are just under £5,000.

His last official engagement was on the evening of September 19, after which Andrew disappeared for a three-day weekend.

He then reappeared in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi on September 23 for a two-day stay.

Most
notable in a series of engagements, was a high-level RUSI conference 
discussing UK-Vietnam defence co-operation and strategic issues in 
South-east Asia. Palace officials say the prince covered the cost of 
this part of his trip personally.

Duties: The Prince attends the Soldiers', Sailors', Marines', Coast Guard & Airmen's Club Ball in New York last night

Buckingham palace has insisted that the stay in New York was paid for by an American 
private defence think tank and the Prince himself

His final engagement was on September 
24 – after which the prince apparently took himself off on holiday again
for five days. Again, palace officials have declined to discuss his 
movements.

Andrew then turned up in Tokyo on Monday this week for 
another public, yet privately-funded, series of engagements.

The main 
thrust of the prince’s visit was to attend a RUSI conference on 
British-Japanese security co-operation, where he shared the stage with 
Sir John Scarlett, former Director of the Security Intelligence Service 
(MI6), and Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe.

Japan is looking to spend 
billions on its defence as tensions rise with China and pressure comes 
from the US for the country to become more pro-active globally. As a 
result huge defence contracts are up for grabs.

According to 
well-placed sources, the prince also took the opportunity to spend some 
time privately with the Japanese royal family.

After initially 
refusing to discuss who was paying for the prince to be there, 
Buckingham Palace eventually admitted – after being challenged by the 
Mail – that RUSI had ‘made a proportionate contribution towards his 
costs’. The think-tank also funded him to fly on to New York on 
Wednesday this week, ostensibly to take part in further high-level 
discussions on its behalf.

Scrutiny: The Prince is the only member of the Royal Family who refuses to publish his travel detail in advance

A spokesman for the prince said he was a ‘great admirer of the RUSI’s work’.

Sources
stressed Andrew did not receive a salary as a member of its 
International Advisory Board and pointed out it ‘already has 
well-established links with the Royal Family, in the form of the Queen, 
who is its patron, and the Duke of Kent, its president’.

A 
spokesman for RUSI said they had been keen to invite Andrew to join 
their advisory board as he ‘endorsed and consolidated RUSI’s status as a
leading independent international think tank’.

However the latest revelations will, once again, shine an unwelcome spotlight on his activities.

In
2001 he became the UK’s Special Representative for Trade and 
Investment. But he was repeatedly accused of wasting taxpayers’ money. 
The final nail in the coffin was the furore over his friendship with 
Jeffrey Epstein, a US financier who has been jailed for soliciting 
prostitution from underage girls. In July 2011 Andrew announced he was 
standing down.

Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 
‘Taxpayers will wonder why they are paying for the Prince’s gallivanting
across the globe, given that he is no longer a UK trade envoy. It is 
imperative that the Prince is open and transparent about exactly how he 
has spent taxpayers’ cash.’
