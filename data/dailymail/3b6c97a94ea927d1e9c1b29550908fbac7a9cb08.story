The remorselessly rising number of carrier bags used by shoppers in England passed seven billion last year, official figures show.

Despite repeated promises by David Cameron to curb the plastic carriers handed out by supermarkets, the total has shot up by more than 12 per cent in two years.

By contrast the number of bags used in Wales – where shoppers have been asked to pay a 5p levy on each bag they take from a shop – has fallen from 270million to 70million since the charge came in.

The first full year’s bag count following the introduction of the charge in Wales appeared to vindicate retailers and campaigners who say the only way to cut numbers of bags is to impose a levy.

Mr Cameron and George Osborne have declined to follow the Welsh example through fears that voters would resent paying extra for plastic carriers that have always been provided free by supermarkets.

However, research in Wales suggests a big majority of shoppers supports the levy, from which money raised goes to charity rather than the Government.

The British Retail Consortium, which 
represents the retail industry, said progress had been made in England, 
and that the weight of plastic handed out at the tills had fallen 
because bags are becoming smaller and lighter.

But it said: ‘If you want to go further and faster on this you would have to introduce legislation for a charge.’

The Daily Mail’s Banish The Bags campaign has been calling for action to cut the numbers of bags and the environmental damage they cause when they are discarded.

Many of the bags are used for only 20 minutes but take up to 1,000 years to rot away. They litter the landscape and devastate marine animals and birds, which suffer long, painful deaths after eating them or getting tangled in them.

The bag count, produced by the Government’s Waste and Resources Action Programme, showed that in 2012 the number used in England went up by 290million to 7.06billion, a 4.4 per cent rise. Over two years the increase has been almost 800million.

The increase pushed numbers used in the UK as a whole over the eight billion mark, despite the collapse in numbers in Wales and steady usage in Scotland, which will introduce a charge next year, and Northern Ireland, where one was implemented in April .

In Wales, where the 5p levy was introduced in November 2011, 350million bags were used in 2010, a total which fell to 270million in 2011 as the levy came into play. Last year 70million carrier bags were used in Wales.

Alun Davies, Welsh minister for natural resources and food, said: ‘Checkouts in Wales are now full of people reusing their bags. The figures show that a compulsory charge really does work.’

Samantha Harding, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘An increase in bag use in England and a massive decrease in Wales are resounding evidence for the Government to finally introduce a charge on carrier bags in England.’

In England among major supermarkets only Marks & Spencer has imposed its own 5p charge.
