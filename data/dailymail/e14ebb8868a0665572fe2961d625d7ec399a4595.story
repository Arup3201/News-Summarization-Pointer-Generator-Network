A killer who strangled his teenage girlfriend after she told him she was pregnant had earlier killed a cat and left its severed head on an ex-girlfriend's pillow. 

Ben Blakeley, who was jailed for life for the murder of Jayden Parkinson, spotted his then girlfriend talking to a male friend and accused her of sleeping around.

The 22-year-old killer flew into a violent rage before attacking the cat with a knife.

The un-named girl said: 'This man is pure evil. Once, he saw me chatting to a man in a local shopping centre and confronted me later at my home.' 

The girl said she tried to convince Blakeley that the man was simply a school friend but the killer could not be convinced. 

She said: 'He ran out into the street and picked up a neighbour's cat and raced upstairs into my bedroom. When I ran up after him he had killed the cat with a kitchen knife and cut the bloody head off and left it on my bed.'

Blakeley told the girl that he killed the cat because she had been sleeping around. 

She told the Daily Star Sunday that she was lucky not to have been killed herself. However, she did not report the cat killing to the police because she was afraid of Blakeley's reaction. 

Ms Parkinson's mother Samantha Shrewsbury, 47, said she hopes Blakeley dies in prison as her daughter was due to give birth this week. 

She said that Blakeley groomed her daughter with a range of gifts, many of them stolen. 

Ms Shrewsbury said that once Blakeley had seduced her daughter, he became violent and controlling. 

Three of Blakeley's ex girlfriends told the court that he was violent and abusive towards them during their relationships. 

Jayden's mother Samantha Shrewsbury said she wished she had pushed Blakeley down the steps from her flat as her daughter might still be alive

Ms Shrewsbury said she tried to split up the couple and get her daughter to return home to Didcot. 

She told The Sunday People: 'We had a stand-off once when he went to pull this screwdriver he had and I dared him. 

'I told him I would charge him and take him down the steps from the top floor of our flat, which shut him up. He was your typical cowardly bully. 

'But I wish to God I had pushed him down those stairs because maybe Jayden would still be here. 

Oxford Crown Court heard that Blakeley smoked cannabis almost daily from the age of 11. 

He told one prison officer 'I'm a celebrity now miss' after spotting a story about him on the television news. 

Blakeley killed Ms Parkinson on December 3, 2013 and initially dumped her body in a countryside ditch. 

He later moved her, digging up his uncle's grave in Didcot, Oxfordshire, dumping her body inside the grave. 

Ms Parkinson was last seen on CCTV on the night she went missing.   

A jury at Oxford Crown Court yesterday found Blakeley guilty of murder following a five-week trial by a majority decision of 11-1 after more than 20 hours of deliberations.

Blakeley, of Reading, Berkshire, had denied murdering Jayden but admitted her manslaughter.

The court heard how he was obsessive and controlling and threatened to post intimate videos and photographs of Jayden on Facebook after their break up, hoping she would kill herself as a result.  

His brother, Jake Blakeley, 17, admitted a charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice by helping to dig the grave in which Jayden was later buried.

The jury of six men and six women was dismissed today having failed to reach a verdict on whether Jake Blakeley, of Didcot, prevented a lawful burial for Jayden. 

The judge said: ‘On December 3 you took Jayden Parkinson, a complicated but loving and vulnerable 17-year-old girl into open countryside near Upton in the dark of an early winter’s evening, you murdered her by strangulation.’

The judge said that his ‘unreasonably jealous’ treatment of Jayden had involved ‘physical and emotional abuse’ during their relationship.

‘You dominated and controlled her daily life,’ the judge said.

‘You removed her phone so she couldn’t contact others and when she was at the hostel you demanded that she stayed in her room even to the extent of forbidding her from using the toilet, forcing her to urinate in a plastic bottle.

‘Jayden was infatuated with you, her violent abuser, and found it difficult to separate emotionally from you.’

The judge said Jayden finally plucked up the courage to end the relationship in November last year, with Blakeley threatening to pose intimate photographs online to ‘humiliate’ her.

‘Unfortunately she discovered that she was pregnant and you were the father,’ the judge said.

‘Being a decent young woman she wished to inform you of that fact.’

The jury at Oxford Crown Court were shown CCTV images of Ms Parkinson and Blakeley, both circled, walking through Oxford train station on the last day that the pregnant teenager was last seen alive

The judge said the pregnancy was the only reason Jayden met Blakeley on December 3.

‘At the time you were in my judgement consumed with anger having found out that Jayden had been intimate with another young man after she had broken off her relationship with you,’ he said.

The judge said Blakeley murdered Jayden without thinking of the possibility she could be carrying his unborn child.

Police used CCTV in a bid to trace Ms Parkinson's movements in the hours before her death

The judge told Blakeley: ‘You first concealed her body in a ditch. It is clear that you later decided to move her body.

‘In the early hours of the morning of December 9 2013 you returned to the ditch and dug up Jayden Parkinson’s body. 

‘You then crammed the mortal remains of poor Jayden into a suitcase.

‘You then persuaded an unwitting taxi driver to transfer her body to All Saints’ Church in Didcot.

‘You had dug a grave for Jayden over the interred body of your Uncle Alan.

‘To your twisted mind you might have thought a graveyard was a better place for Jayden to be buried than a ditch in a field but there was no respect or remorse in this hasty interment.’

The judge said Jayden’s father had died shortly before the trial and must have been ‘haunted’ by what Blakeley had done.

He said Blakeley had caused upset to the priest, congregation and family members of those buried in the graveyard by the ‘sacrilege done there’.

The judge also jailed Blakeley for eight years for attempting to pervert the course of justice, to run concurrently with his murder sentence.

Members of Jayden’s family shouted ‘See you in hell’ as he was led to the cells.

Emotional victim impact statements from Jayden Parkinson's family were read to the court, describing how her murder has affected them.

Jayden's mother Samantha Shrewsbury, wept as her lengthy statement was read, detailing how her family's lives had been ‘changed forever’.

‘Jayden was not only my youngest child but also my best friend,’ she said.

‘The day I had to attend the John Radcliffe hospital mortuary to identify the remains of my beloved daughter will remain sealed in my memory until the end of my days on this earth.

‘The sight of Jayden's bruised and battered beautiful face is an image that can never be erased from my mind.’

Ms Shrewsbury said the impact of her daughter's death had left her contemplating suicide, but the support of her family helped her make it through the days.

‘I am mentally and physically exhausted,’ she said, stating that her weight had dropped to below seven stone.

‘The only solace I can find is to keep a diary and write to Jayden about how my day has been, mostly about how much I love and miss her and the girly chats and fun which we used to share,’ she said.

‘I know she will never be here with me to tell her about my day or to tell her how much I love and miss her.

‘When I visit Jayden's grave it breaks my heart to not be able to hold Jayden safe in my arms, take her home with me and tell her how much I love her, in order to lay Jayden to rest and knowing that I will never be able to see her in a wedding dress and to have children of her own to love and cherish.

‘My family had to choose a dress for her to be buried in yet we will never be able to see her happy and smiling in that dress.’

Ms Shrewsbury described how the ‘evil person’ who took Jayden was still able to breathe and eat three meals a day.

‘The thought and reality that I and my family will never be able to celebrate birthdays, Easters, Christmases with Jayden and take her to the music festival I promised her for her 18th fills me with deep sadness,’ she added.

‘Nothing will be able to remove the anger and heartbreak that fill my life every waking day.’

Ms Shrewsbury said she was haunted by questions of whether her daughter was ‘crying out for help’ or ‘aware her life was being taken’ during her murder.

‘I and Jayden's family cannot and never will find any forgiveness,’ she said.

Jayden's sister, Shardy George, also submitted a victim impact statement to the court.

‘There isn't a day that goes by I don't think of Jayden but I don't get upset anymore,’ she said.

‘Instead I think of the good times we had. Although my heart aches my face smiles. Ben Blakeley has done enough to my family without ruining my happiness.

‘I won't give him the satisfaction. When he took my sister's life he didn't just take her life and that of her unborn child, he ripped our family and community apart.’
