The former bodyguard of £149million lottery winner Adrian Bayford says he proposed to her just days before getting engaged to his current fiancée.

Marta Jarosz, 30, claims the multi-millionaire sent her a text message saying 'I would marry you' while on holiday in the Maldives with Samantha Burbidge, who he proposed to two days later.

She said Mr Bayford begged her to go travelling with him instead of Ms Burbidge, but she refused because she was already in love with welder Alex Martin, who she fell for on the same night she met the lottery winner for the first time.

Marta Jarosz and Adrian Bayford were pictured together in February, leading to speculation they were a couple

According to The Sun, Ms Jarosz met Mr Bayford, 43, on December 20 last year while working as a bouncer at the Rose and Crown pub in Haverhill when he approached her and asked: 'Do you know who I am?'

Mr Bayford then offered her a £1,200-a-month job as his bodyguard, driver and personal assistant. The pair swapped numbers, and he texted her later that night

However, on the same evening, Ms Jarosz went for a drink after her shift with Mr Martin and the pair have been together since.

Ms Jarosz did go to work for Mr Bayford, but noticed that whenever he took his staff out for a meal, he would insist on sitting next to her.

He also told her that she made him smile and feel good about himself, though she insists she didn't know he was interested in her.

A few months later, the pair were pictured together walking towards Stansted Airport while Mr Bayford was going to see his children in Scotland, sparking rumours of a romance.

In fact, Mr Bayford took the trip alone and Ms Jarosz returned home to see her boyfriend, but says she was banned from speaking to the press to deny the relationship.

She told The Sun: 'I realise now that he wanted me and wanted the world to think we were a couple.'

She also said that Mr Bayford had trouble enjoying his winnings, saying that his life was 'boring' and he should have more fun.

After his trip to Scotland, Mr Bayford announced he was going on his dream trip to the Maldives and insisted in taking Ms Jarosz.

But when she found out she was the only member of staff invited she refused, and told him to take a man instead.

She says Mr Bayford went quiet after that. The pair stopped talking, and he eventually messaged to say he was taking another girl he had met instead.

That girl was Samantha Burbidge, a horse groom 16 years his junior who he had also met in a local pub.

While he was away, Mr Bayford messaged Ms Jarosz twice more to say 'I want you' and 'can't help my feelings', she claims.

He also sent another message on Facebook to say: 'I would marry you no probs. I always wanted you as a girlfriend. Would you have married me?'

Ms Jarosz simply replied 'no', and two days afterwards Mr Bayford announced he was engaged to Ms Burbidge.

When Mr Bayford returned from holiday, he allegedly got another member of his entourage to fire Ms Jarosz, simply saying there was no more work for her to do.

Mr Bayford has refused to comment on the allegations, though Ms Jarosz's boyfriend Alex added: 'Adrian is a lonely man and thinks his money can get him whatever he wants.'
