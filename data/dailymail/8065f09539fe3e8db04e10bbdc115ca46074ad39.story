Three in ten victims of card fraud have to wait for refunds amid claims that banks are dragging out the process.

The law states that those who lose money through card theft or cloning are entitled to an immediate refund.

However, a study by consumer champions at Which? found a number of banks are guilty of delays, leaving victims out of pocket and at risk of penalty charges.

Long wait: Three in ten credit card fraud victims are having to wait for a refund because banks are dragging out the process, according to a study by Which?

In some cases, victims have had to borrow from friends and family to pay for food, travel and other essentials.

The ploy appears to be part of a trend among the finance giants to try and shift the blame and cost of card fraud on to customers.

Some have slipped in changes to their smallprint rules that would allow them to deny refunds to some victims of card fraud.

A survey of more than 4,000 Which? members found 29 per cent of those suffering credit and debit card fraud had to wait weeks or even months to get their cash back.

It said that Barclays and Barclaycard customers were least likely to be reimbursed immediately, with 39 per cent experiencing delays.

Even the best performer, First Direct, delayed refunds to 17 per cent of customers.

Banks generally paid up in the end with 98 per cent of victims eventually getting their money back. Which? said this indicated that too many banks are being unfairly suspicious of their customers when it comes to card fraud.

Executive director at Which?, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘Our research shows that banks are too often failing to refund customers immediately when they have been victims of fraud.

New terms: Some banks, such as HSBC and Santander have changed the small print on credit card deals which means that customers must check no one is looking when they enter their pin at cash machines or in shops

‘With £340million lost to card fraud a year, there are large sums at stake that can leave people seriously out of pocket and unable to pay essential bills.  

‘Banks are required by law to give victims of fraud an immediate refund, unless they have evidence that person is acting fraudulently or with gross negligence.

‘They should do everything they can to help people who find themselves in this situation through no fault of their own, as part of the wider big change that’s urgently needed to make banks work for customers not bankers.’

Santander made changes to its smallprint rules at the beginning of January that will allow it to shift the cost and responsibility of card fraud to customers in some circumstances. HSBC did something similar last year.

Santander’s changes mean that customers must have a unique four-digit PIN that is only used alongside its credit and debit cards.

Customers have been told they must have a PIN that cannot be easily guessed, such as 1234, 9999 or a year of birth.

They must also make sure criminals are not looking over their shoulders when they use PINs at checkouts or cash machines.

Any breach of these rules could, in theory, allow the bank to deny a refund.

Santander said it was simply trying to help customers protect themselves against fraud and insisted that innocent victims would get a full refund.

Barclays insisted the Which? figures are simply wrong and that its greatest priority is to settle fraud cases quickly.

‘In the majority of cases across Barclays and Barclaycard, nine in 10 cases are settled within three days with a selected few going on for further investigation,’ it said.

The UK Cards Association said: ‘Customers who become the victims of fraud get a high level of protection from their card companies and can expect to receive a full refund on any losses.

'This entitlement is enshrined by regulation, with the timing of refunds agreed between the industry and the FSA.

‘In some instances where the fraud is complex, the case takes more time to investigate. Notwithstanding this, the picture painted by the findings suggests we have further to go, working with our members, to ensure that customers move through that process quickly.’
