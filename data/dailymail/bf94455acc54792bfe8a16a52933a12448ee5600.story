Prince William has said an emotional goodbye to his childhood nanny, Olga Powell, who was at his side through both childhood and the most important days in his adult life. Mrs Powell, 82, passed away at the end of last month and her funeral was held this morning for family and close friends in Harlow, Essex. The loving, but strict nanny, is widely credited for having a massive impact on the lives of both Prince William and Prince Harry as they were growing up.

Olga Powell was widely credited with helping her young charges William and Harry cope with the breakdown of their parents' marriage

Prince William cancelled four high-profile engagements in the North East of England to be at today’s private service. He also represented his brother, Prince Harry, who was unable to attend as he is currently serving his country in Afghanistan.

Wearing a dark blue suit and black tie he was flanked by Princess Diana’s two sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, 55, and Lady Jane Fellowes, 53, for the 30-minute service at Parndon Wood Crematorium. The Prince had appeared calm and relaxed as he greeted fellow mourners outside the crematorium.

He stood solemnly as the three-car funeral procession made its way up the road. More than 100 mourners attended the service to pay tribute to Mrs Powell, who lived in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire.

Kate Middleton, The Duchess of Cambridge, remained in the North East for the royal engagements. Mrs Powell, who was widowed after just six years of marriage when she was 52, came to work for Princess Diana when Prince William was just six months old. Although very loving, she was renowned for not taking any nonsense from the young boys, and famously would give them a clip around their ear if they were ever naughty. Her smart semi-detached home was filled with pictures of the young princes and only last year she spoke excitedly about attending Prince William’s wedding to Kate Middleton.

Mrs Powell, who was born into a farming family, attended the ceremony and reception but declined the royal invite for the evening’s entertainment, fearing she could be tired after a long day. She was nanny to the princes for 15 years, there at their sides as their parents divorced and to comfort them after their mother, Princess Diana, died in a car crash in Paris in 1997. Mrs Powell continued to be a part of their lives, attending Prince Harry’s confirmation at Eton College in 2000, and Prince WIlliam’s 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle, along with his passing out parade from Sandhurst in 2006.

Mrs Powell was rushed to Princes Alexandra Hospital, Harlow after collapsing near her home in Broxbourne on September 25 but she sadly died later the same day. A request was made ahead of today’s funeral for family flowers only, with donations to be made to Prince Harry’s own charity, Sentebale, which supports orphans and young children in Lesotho. Mrs Powell’s husband, Charles, passed away in 1952, after the couple had been married for six years. Popular and well-loved, Mrs Powell often gave talks to local WI groups about her role as a nanny in the royal household and was highly respected for refusing to disclose any family secrets after she retired.
