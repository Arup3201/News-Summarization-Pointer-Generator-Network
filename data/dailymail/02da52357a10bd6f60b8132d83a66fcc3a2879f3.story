A staunch campaign is underway to find a family's beloved border terrier called Toby, who was dog napped just over two weeks ago.

The devastated Marsh family from Surrey has staged a re-enactment of the dog-kidnapping in the hope that someone will come forward with information about their cherished pet's whereabouts.

Owner Lousie Marsh, a veterinary surgeon, has set up a ‘Find Toby Terrier’ Twitter profile, which has over 1,500 followers, and a Facebook page with more than  1,400 'likes'. 

Reenactment shows a Toby lookalike being passed through the window of a silver estate car

Animal Search UK has been drafted in to try and help find the terrier and a £1,000 reward offered

The campaign has captured the nation and messages from @FindTobyTerrier profile have been retweeted by celebrities such as Andy Murray, Will Young and Lorraine Kelly and Border terrier owners including Dermot O'Leary, Keith Lemon, and David Walliams.

Louise believes Toby must have slipped out of the front door when she went to fetch something from the car during the afternoon on 10 October.

Once she noticed he was missing she  began door-to-door inquires. Louise  met a boy who said he had caught Toby and put him on a lead.

The boy had been asking a few houses whether anyone knew who the dog belonged to when he was approached by a man who volunteered to drive Toby to the vet to scan him for a microchip. The boy gave him the dog in good faith, but Toby has not been seen since.

The man who took Toby is described as between 40 and 50 years old, white, with a bald or shaved head. He was driving a silver estate car and had a young boy  in the front.

At the time of the suspected dog-napping, Toby was wearing a green suede collar with a silver buckle and is micro chipped.

Since then, Louise has called in Animal Search UK to investigate. She’s been distributing leaflets  and putting up posters. Articles have appeared in local papers and the story has been broadcast on local radio and Jeremy Vine’s Radio 2 show.

Not giving up: Owner Louise Marsh is devastated and hopes the  campaign will help locateToby

Toby was especially close to Louise’s six-month-old daughter, Pippa, and Peggy, the Marsh's three-legged crossbreed rescue dog, who is now pining for the terrier.

‘Toby has been fixated on the baby since she arrived and was never far from her side,’ says Louise.

‘When he heard her crying he would run to both me and my husband to double check we were coming.’

Now Peggy is not eating and refuses to go out. ‘Toby has been a companion for Peggy and they always slept together curled up in a ball.’

‘Toby is very much a part of our family, we call him our 'first born'. We have been blown away by the support to find him so far.’

A £1,000 reward has been offered to anyone who can help locate Toby. If you have any information please call 0800 4 320 340.
