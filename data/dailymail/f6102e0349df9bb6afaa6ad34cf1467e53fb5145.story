Louise Mensch triggered today's Corby by-election when she quit as the MP to move her family to the US

Senior Tories predicted a ‘bloodbath’ in the Corby by-election today, blaming outgoing MP Louise Mensch for impending electoral disaster.

Party chiefs said they were on course to lose the Northamptonshire seat to Labour because Mrs Mensch decided to abandon her seat to move to New York.

The seat was won by the Tories in 2010 for the first time since 1992.

Insiders said a ‘massive Mensch factor’ is preventing them defending the 2,000 majority she won at the 2010 general election.

One senior figure told the Mail: ‘It’s going to be a bloodbath. We are going to get absolutely hammered.’

The source said Mrs Mensch’s name was ‘toxic’ on the doorstep.

The former Tory A-List candidate was hailed as one of the faces of the new look party before the last election.

But locals were unimpressed when she announced that she is moving her family to the US halfway through the Parliament to be closer to her husband Peter, the manager of rock band Metallica.

Labour officials sought to downplay the prospects of an easy win, pointing out that windy weather could keep their voters from the polls.

'We think we have won the campaign but we are nervous about the outcome,' a source said.

'We will wait and see but whoever wins, no-one should expect it to be a big numerical majority.'

David Cameron is urging the public to vote today in ‘historic’ elections for Police and Crime Commissioners amid fears of a record low turnout.

The Prime Minister said the first elections for commissioners in 41 force areas in England and Wales were a chance for voters to ‘have a say about policing and crime in their areas’.

Some have predicted turnout could be as low as 15 per cent, but a poll by ComRes found nearly half of those questioned were aware of the elections and intend to vote.

Mr Cameron, who has been criticised for not doing enough to raise awareness of today’s elections, said: ‘At the moment there is only one elected police commissioner in the country – Boris Johnson in London.

‘But today, for the first time ever, everyone in the country can vote for one local law and order champion who sets the priorities for their police force.'

Early postal vote returns suggest the overall turnout will be around 20 per cent, low even by modern standards in a by-election.

Senior Tories are nervous that if 
their voters fail to turn out, they could slip into third place behind 
the UK Independence Party. The Liberal Democrats face the humiliation of
losing their deposit.

UKIP
sources said they are ‘confident’ of securing at least third place but 
doubtful that they can catch the Tories for second place.

In all three by-elections are being held today.

Manchester Central, with a Labour majority of more than 10,000 from 2010, was vacated by Tony Lloyd so that he could stand in today's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) elections.

Cardiff Central, where Labour won by just over 4,700 two-and-a-half years ago, was prompted by the resignation of another PCC candidate, Alun Michael, who has held the seat for 25 years.

Labour also a shoo-in to retain both seats.

In what promises to be a bad day for the Conservatives they predicted that the party would also lose key contests in the Tory heartlands in the police commissioner elections - also being held on Super Thursday - with Labour poised to triumph in Bedfordshire.

Labour predicted that they will gain 8 and 10 of the PCC elections, seizing control of policing in major metropolitan areas like Manchester, the west Midlands, Northumbria and West Yorkshire.

But that is lower than the 12 predicted by independent experts.
