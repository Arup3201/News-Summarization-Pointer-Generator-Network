Opening up: Cooper, seen earlier this year, told a crowd of students that he initially kept his homosexuality private for fear that it would interrupt his work

Anderson Cooper has said that his decision to come out as gay has not stopped some persistent female admirers from trying to seduce him.

Cooper joked that he decided to come out in July 2012 because he wanted to get more interested men, but said that there are still some 'very determined young ladies'.

'Being born gay is one of the great blessings of my life,' he said during a talk at the University of Texas-Arlington on Monday night.

The 46-year-old has been in a longterm
 relationship with partner Ben Maisani since 2009 and the couple lives 
together in his converted firehouse in Manhattan's West Village.

There
 was speculation that the pair split shortly after Cooper came out since
 Maisani was spotted kissing another man in Central Park but they have 
appeared to moved past it.

Cooper
 and Maisani, who owns a number of bars in New York, were seen together 
at a friend's club opening in September but tend to keep a low profile.

For
 years, Cooper kept his sexuality a secret to the public but was open 
with his friends and colleagues, claiming that it was because he thought
 that it would interfere with his work overseas in less tolerant 
countries.

He explained that further during the talk on the college campus, with the school's newspaper The Shorthorn reporting that he said it made him less anonymous.

'Itâ€™s harder to tell a story when people know about you,' the CNN anchor said.

Together: Cooper has been dating night club owner Ben Maisani since 2009 (seen here in May 2013)

'In order to tell a good story, you want to be a sponge for the information they want to tell you.'

The topic of coming out was made pertinent during the Monday talk because of the news over the weekend that college football player Michael Sam announced he is gay.

Sam is expected to be a top NFL draft pick which would make him the first openly gay professional football player.

When asked how Cooper thought it would be for Sam moving forward, being a 'gay football player', The Star Telegram reports that Cooper suggested that it was a similar barrier to that of race or religion- likening Sam to those who were the first Jewish football player or the first black football player.

A segment about Sam's coming out and the possible changes to locker room dynamics also aired on Cooper's CNN show AC360 on Monday night.

The CNN anchor came out in 2012 and lives with his longtime boyfriend but apparently that hasn't stopped ladies from making advances

Spoke about how the announcement of the first gay football player will later be seen just as other barriers- like race and religion- being broken
