Detectives are hunting for a man accused of murdering his grandparents after they discovered he had searched for 'gun shows' on the internet a day before their bodies were found.

Michael Boysen, 26, has not been seen since the unnamed couple, both in their early 80s, were discovered dead in their home, in Renton, Washington, on Saturday morning.

He was just released from prison on a different charge on Friday

Initially police said he was not a suspect in the killing, but he has now been branded an 'extreme danger to the public and police' after it was discovered he had visited various firearms websites on the internet in the days before they died.

Police are also searching for the 
victims' missing red, 2001 Chrysler 300 and today released a grainy CCTV
image of it in a bid to track the vehicle down.

Authorities have accused Boysen of 
killing his 82-year-old grandfather and 80-year-old grandmother in their
home late Friday or early Saturday.

Sheriff's spokeswoman Sgt. Cindi West says their bodies were discovered Saturday. The cause of the deaths hasn't been released.

At first police said he wasn't connected to the deaths, but later he was named a suspect.

He had been released from prison on Friday.

The Washington Department of Corrections says Boysen had been in prison since 2006 on three counts of robbery.

He was supposed to check with a community supervision officer within 24 hours of his release.
