Taking a light-hearted break from sweating it out on court at the Australian Open, 19-year-old Aussie tennis star Nick Kyrgios and 25-year-old Belarusian beauty Victoria Azarenka indulged in some public Twitter flirting last night.

Finding himself with five minutes to spare, Kyrgios asked fans to shoot him some questions. After some pretty standard chit chat, former women's world number one Azarenka decided to get in on the action, and she didn't hold back.
