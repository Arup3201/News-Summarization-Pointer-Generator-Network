The 'crackers' TV licence cannot survive for another decade, Boris Johnson warned today as he insisted the BBC uses it to 'demolish' its competition.

The senior Conservative said changing viewing habits mean it is harder to justify the 'full whack' of the levy on every family with a television.

He admitted that he now never watches TV news, although he admitted that this is in part because he struggles to turn his television on.

London Mayor Boris Johnson admitted that he now never watches TV news, although he admitted that this is in part because he struggles to turn his television on

A committee of MPs said last week that a new tax could be imposed on every all households – not just those with televisions – to replace the £145.50-a-year licence fee which has funded the BBC for the past 69 years.

BBC director general Tony Hall has said he is open to the idea, even though it would mean an estimated 500,000 extra households having to pay for a service they do not use or currently get free.

But Mr Johnson today insisted the idea of funding the full slate of BBC output was now in doubt, and the BBC 'needs to think about its future'.

Speaking on LBC radio, the London Mayor said: 'Many people now no longer get their news, many young people in particular, no longer get their news from TV.

'They don't listen to the Today programme. I don't watch TV news now, I'm afraid to say, I get it all on the web. So the BBC needs to think about its future.'

He went on: 'I have to say I can't see how it can go on forever having a tax on TVs that not everybody uses any more.

'I can barely make my TV work. Frankly I come down and I sit at home wait shouting pathetically for some child to come and help me turn it on.' 

The Culture, Media and Sport select committee suggested the licence fee could continue for another decade, before being reformed in the 2020s.

But Mr Johnson insisted: 'That seems to me to be too long not to be taking account of the very rapid changes.

'At the moment every house pays £150 in a levy on their television which is crackers. This thing needs to be rethought, the licence fee is plainly anachronistic.

'It needs to be trimmed, it needs to be cut but you are never going to get away from the situation in which people feel the certainty that we are supporting really, really high quality broadcasting in this country.'

BBC director general Lord Tony Hall has said he believes the licence fee 'has got at least another ten years in it'

He said there would be a case for some money raised from taxpayers to be used to ensure a very high standard of public broadcasting.

But he said he doubted whether this meant the 'full whack of the licence fee' was necessary.

'There is going to have to be a change. I think that we are moving in that direction.

'The basic question is do you need public sector broadcasting. Should we be putting taxpayers' money into broadcasting? The argument would be we put taxpayers' money into supporting all sorts of arts, and they would die in this country if you didn't have support for the arts.

'I think you probably do need to support quality broadcasting, proper fantastic productions that the BBC specialises in.

'Whether you need to support the whole machine… The BBC can be extremely anti-competitive. They take huge sums of money from the taxpayer, from the licence payer, and use it to cross-subsidise businesses that demolish local newspapers, local websites.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'We agree with Boris on supporting high quality public broadcasting in this country, and that it would be a shame to lose that, which is why it is important that the BBC is able to continue offering the high quality news, drama, and entertainment the British public loves.'

The Corporation insisted that 96 per cent of people use BBC services every week. 

Changing viewing habits, including watching online and subscription services, mean the TV licence has become harder to justify

BBC boss Lord Hall yesterday defended the licence fee and said the corporation's opponents have to be 'honest about the consequences' of their plans for the organisation.

In a speech at New Broadcasting House in central London, he said the corporation was at 'a crossroads' and the licence fee - which is not currently required to watch catch-up TV on iPlayer - must be amended to cover 'catch-up television as soon as possible'. 

The director general said: 'We've always said that the licence fee should be updated to reflect changing times. I welcome the committee's endorsement of our proposal to require people to pay the licence fee even if they only watch catch-up television. The committee has suggested another route to modernising the licence fee - a universal household levy.

'Both proposals have the same goal in mind: adapting the licence fee for the internet age. This is vital. Because I believe we need and we will need what the licence fee - in whatever form - makes happen - more than ever.

'In fact, I'm going to go further and argue that if we didn't have a BBC funded by a licence fee, such is the world we face, we'd have to invent it.'
