Slaven Bilic was approached by an angry fan towards the end of the game as the home supporters showed their disgust at going out of the competition - but the former West Ham man looked far from intimidated.

Boli Bolingoli-Mbombo scored a double to help Club Brugge progress with a 5-2 aggregate win over Besiktas.

The 19-year-old cousin of Romelu Lukaku came off the bench to punish the Turkish side who were pushing for a winner. 

Tom de Sutter had earlier taken advantage of some lax goalkeeping to add to his goal from the 2-1 win in the first leg, meaning Ramon's fine strike for the Turkish side was merely a memory by the time the final whistle blew - with Besiktas down to 10 men after the late loss of Olcay Sahan.

Brilliant Fiorentina stunned Roma with an early goal blitz to seal their spot in the quarter-finals at the expense of their Italian rivals.

Roma might have held a narrow advantage after drawing the first leg 1-1 in Florence but any hopes of progressing were sunk inside 21 minutes on Thursday as Gonzalo Rodriguez, Marcos Alonso and Jose Maria Basanta all netted for Fiorentina.

Sorry Roma finished with 10 men following Adem Ljajic's late dismissal.

Sevilla remain on course to retain their title after easing past fellow Spanish side Villarreal.

Having done most of the damage with a 3-1 first leg win at El Madrigal, Sevilla finished things off at home with a 2-1 victory courtesy of second-half goals from Vicente Iborra and his replacement Denis Suarez.

Villarreal had netted in-between those strikes through Giovani dos Santos' fine free-kick but almost immediately had centre-back Eric Bailly sent off as they tumbled out 5-2 on aggregate.

Napoli are also through after a hard-fought goalless draw against Dinamo Moscow in Russia. The Italians held a 3-1 lead from the first leg and that proved sufficient as they survived a second-leg onslaught from Stanislav Cherchesov's men.

Zenit St Petersburg qualified for the quarters despite going down 1-0 to a late headed goal from Torino's Kamil Gilk at the Stadio Olimpico.

Zenit arrived for the second leg in Italy with a two-goal cushion, and it proved just enough for Andre Villas-Boas' team to progress after a bruising encounter.

Finally, Yevhen Konoplyanka's extra-time score booked Dnipro's spot on away goals after they claimed a 2-2 aggregate 'win' over Ajax.

Riechedly Bazoer fired Ajax ahead in the 60th minute and levelled the tie at 1-1 after Dnipro had taken a 1-0 lead in the first leg, however neither side could find a winning goal before the 90 minutes were up, meaning the game went into extra-time.

Dnipro took the advantage when Konoplyanka calmly broke to the left edge of Ajax's box before unleashing a shot which found the bottom right corner, meaning that Mike van der Hoorn's goal late in extra time served little purpose.
