A mixed-race toddler must be taken from a ‘perfect’ white couple who wanted to adopt him and given to a black aunt he has never met, a judge ruled yesterday.

The 20-month-old boy has been lovingly cared for by his adoptive parents for the past 13 months and will suffer distress and perhaps psychological harm when he is removed from them.

But Mr Justice Holman said these factors were outweighed by the child’s chance to be brought up by his father’s family, who can teach him about his African heritage.

The experienced family court judge said it was one of the most harrowing cases he had heard and expressed regret at the ‘intense grief’ his ruling would cause.

The adoptive parents’ heartbreak could have been avoided if the father of the boy had come forward earlier. But the man, a 32-year-old black African who claimed asylum in England in 2001, initially showed no real interest in the baby, referred to only as ‘C’, and even denied it was his.

The child’s mother, who is white and in her early twenties, has struggled with alcohol and drug problems. While still a teenager she had two children by different fathers. They are now aged three and five, and have both been adopted.

Her third child, C, was taken from her five days after his birth in March last year and placed with foster carers by Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council in South Yorkshire.

At seven months old he was placed for adoption with the white couple, named as ‘A’ and ‘B’. Social worker Elizabeth Lancaster assessed the couple as being ‘remarkable people’, ‘perfect’ parents for the little boy and almost ‘the ideal adopters’.

The judge paid tribute to how they attended courses to prepare themselves for taking on the child, and read books to him about his father’s home country in Africa.

The child is now ‘very well attached’ to the couple and feels secure with them, the judge said. One of the adoptive parents told the court: ‘He is such a happy, settled, loving little person who knows who we are ... I love him so much. He will always be my son.’

This is not the first time Rotherham’s social services have caused controversy.

This summer they were criticised in a report that found at least 1,400 children suffered sexual exploitation in the borough over a 16-year period.

And in 2012 there was a row after the council removed three siblings of ethnic minority descent from experienced foster parents because they were members of Ukip. 

The married couple, who had been fostering for nearly seven years, said they were made to feel like criminals when a social worker told them their views on immigration made them unsuitable carers.

Rotherham council’s former director of children’s services Joyce Thacker said at the time that the quality of the couple’s care was ‘not an issue’.

She added: ‘These children are from EU migrant backgrounds and Ukip has made very clear statements on ending multiculturalism. I have to think about how sensitive I am being to those children.’

But while frontline social workers supported adoption by A and B, Rotherham’s interim director of children’s services and C’s court-appointed guardian backed the aunt.

C’s biological mother had initially claimed that the child’s father was her white long-term partner, who has a criminal record and a history of drug problems.

Social workers noticed that the boy appeared to be of mixed race but accepted the mother’s word.

But this March, after A and B had started formal adoption proceedings, the aunt contacted social services to say her brother was in fact the father. A genetic test confirmed this was the case, and social workers assessed that the 29-year-old aunt, a single mother who lives in the Home Counties, was a suitable carer for the child.

Mr Justice Holman ruled that C should be placed with the aunt after a five-day family court hearing.

He said: ‘I know, and deeply regret, that my decision will cause intense grief. After hearing all the evidence and argument, and after due consideration, I am, however, clear as to the outcome, which I do not reach narrowly or marginally.

‘I have no doubt that public reaction to this judgment and decision is likely to be polarised, with some agreeing and some strongly disagreeing with what I have decided.’

Under the Adoption and Children Act 2002, the most important concern of family courts is a child’s welfare ‘throughout his life’.

Judges must take into account the likely effect of the child’s being adopted and ceasing to be a member of their original family. They must not make an adoption order unless they consider that doing so would be better than not doing so.

Once a child has been formally adopted, the order can be revoked only in ‘highly exceptional and very particular circumstances’.
