A 72-year-old who was arrested for possessing an antique gun was pulled over during a drugs search in a car littered with used heroin bags, police have claimed.

Gordon Van Gilder was stopped in Cumberland County, New Jersey, last November with a mid-1700s flintock pistol in the glove compartment.

The former teacher was arrested and is now facing 10 years of prison, despite claiming the case is a waste of taxpayers' money.

But revelations from the sheriff's department have revealed Van Gilder was 'acting suspiciously' in an area of high drug activity.

Upset: Gordon van Gilder, pictured, had an antique gun from the 1700s in his car at the time of a traffic stop 

Piece of history: The gun is reportedly 300 three years old and was made in the 1700s

According to the Cumberland County Sheriff's Department Van Gilder was in the passenger alongside Adam Puttergill, 21, and allegedly admitted he was in the area to buy drugs. 

Officers found drugs on him and charged him with possession of a dangerous substance. 

Officers also found empty heroin bags on the floor. But Van Gilder wasn't slapped with drug charges - only possession of an unlawful weapon.  

Cumberland County Sheriff Robert Austino told NJ.com: 'This is not just a case of the police picking on an elderly gun collector.' 

Van Gilder described the incident during an interview with NRA News. He claims he was stopped for what the news outlet called a 'minor traffic violation' and a sheriff's deputy asked to do a search. 

A deputy asked if there was anything dangerous in the car, he answered that the glove compartment contained the pistol.

'The reason I got the firearm was it goes with my collection of 18th-century objects,' he said.

'One of the undersheriffs said, "Well, let him go, it's 250 years old." But his boss, who is the sheriff, said, "No, we have to arrest him."

'Next morning, I am sleeping and I hear big pounding on the door, and four of them came and took me away with three or four sheriff's cars - I guess they didn't have anything better to do with taxpayers' money, by the way.' 

Evan Nappen, Van Gilder's attorney, said his client is facing up to ten years in state's prison with a minimum mandatory three-and-a-half to five years.

He has no chance of parole, because New Jersey's modern handgun law includes antique handguns.

Lawyer: Evan Nappen has said his client is 'facing the same draconian penalty as if he had a .44 Magnum loaded on his person'

'I'm charged as a felon,' Van Gilder, added. 'That could ruin my life. That could hurt my pension that I spent 34 years acquiring. I couldn't vote now, and it's not right, it's not fair.'

'Maybe technically I did violate New Jersey law, 'but as a very wise man said once upon a time, "If that's the law, then the law is an a**.''

A fundraising website for Van Gilder's legal fees, which has already raised over $18,000 out of a $25,000 goal, says he is facing a felony second-degree criminal possession of a handgun charge.

Nappen said in an emailed statement to Daily Mail Online Thursday that 'this is an example of New Jersey's extreme gun control.'

Jennifer Webb-McRae, Cumberland County Prosecutor, declined to comment.

Cumberland County Sheriff Robert Austino told Daily Mail Online: 'My answer is that one must ask what a person is doing with any type of gun in a glove box, in a known drug area and admittedly there for the sole purpose of buying drugs.'

He continued, 'In fact used heroin packets were found in his vehicle along with drugs on the driver (who was arrested). In addition, state law clearly covers antique firearms and he was in violation. If people disagree, then they should act to change the law.'

Nappen said in an emailed statement to Daily Mail Online 'Why? Obviously, flintlocks are the weapon of choice for drug dealers. My [72-year-old severely] arthritic client was given a ride to [retrieve] his 18th century antique. He is not on drugs, but the folks who made New Jersey's gun laws may well have been.'
