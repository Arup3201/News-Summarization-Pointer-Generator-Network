A runner has collapsed and died after crossing the finish line of a half marathon on one of the hottest days of the year.

The man in his thirties was among more than 2,000 runners yesterday in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, who were raising funds for a nearby hospice.

Staff rushed the man to a medical tent for treatment by a doctor, but he was declared dead soon afterwards.

The 13.1-mile course was being run in aid of Havens Hospices, a charity providing end-of-life care to terminally ill children and adults.

A spokeswoman for the charity said: 'It is with immense sadness that we can confirm a runner who took part in the Southend Half Marathon has died.

'The male runner collapsed at the finish line and treatment was given immediately by the on-site medic team, then transferred to the medical tent where he was treated by a senior doctor, but he sadly died a short while afterwards. His next of kin have been informed.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this incredibly sad time.'

The race began at 10am and was run along East Beach in Shoebury, to the east of central Southend.

The man is believed to have collapsed at around 12 noon, having completed the course in temperatures of 25C.

A spokesman for Essex Police confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.

More than 300 tributes have poured in on Facebook to the runner, who has not yet been identified.

The Southend Half Marathon has been held for more than 20 years and yesterday's incident is thought to be the first death of a participant.

Runner Chris Phillips, 32, said: 'It’s terrible news. I just can’t imagine how it must feel to wave somebody goodbye at the start and then not being able to see them again at the end.

'It was particularly hot along the seafront and you could see people struggling because of how hot it was.

'But there were a lot of water stations, and there was even one man on the seafront who came out with a hosepipe.'

A total of 2,133 runners completed the 13.1-mile course and were expected to raise up to £100,000.

The Essex coroner is expected to open and adjourn an inquest tomorrow.
