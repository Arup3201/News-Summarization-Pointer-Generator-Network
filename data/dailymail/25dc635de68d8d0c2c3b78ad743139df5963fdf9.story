Karlie Kloss and Joan Smalls have been announced as the new model hosts of MTV's House of Style, once hosted by the world's original supermodel Cindy Crawford.

Chosen because 'they are genuinely friends,' the eclectic duo, known for their fun-loving and extroverted personalities, will create all new episodes of the iconic Nineties fashion show set to relaunch on October 9th.

The pair, 20 and 24 respectively, squeal with excitement in a sneak peek video released today, giving viewers a taste of what's to come when they take the reins of the newly revived show.

Fun and games: Karlie Kloss and Joan Smalls have been announced as the new model hosts of MTV's House of Style, once hosted by the world's original supermodel Cindy Crawford

Miss Smalls, currently ranked the world's number one model by fashion arbiter Models.com, and Miss Kloss, a Victoria's Secret and Vogue regular, nearly combust with anticipation as they reveal their news in the video.

'It's a new era, we have lots of work ahead of us!' they chime together. 'It's our world, the fashion world and the music world.'

Parlaying America's then growing 
fascination with 'the supermodel', the original show featured a 
behind-the-scenes look into the modelling industry, and the lives of 
young models like Linda Evangelista, Helena Christensen, Naomi Campbell, and Christy Turlington.

Designers such as Jean Paul Gaultier,
Dolce & Gabbana and Marc Jacobs also featured on the 
original show, along with up-and-comers like Sofia Coppola, before the 
Virgin Suicides, and Winona Ryder, both making appearances.

The show swung from controversial topics such as eating disorders, to footage of Naomi Campbell putting on acne medicine and Cindy Crawford rapping with Will Smith.

Grilling the new hosts for information 
at last nights MTV Video Music Awards, Refinery 29 quizzed the pair on 
who they would like to feature on upcoming episodes.

Miss Kloss exclaimed: 'We need ideas from people! Can you tell people to tweet us, we want ideas!'

Despite having their own vivacious personalities, Miss Kloss admitted she would like to channel Cindy Crawford.

'Especially those first, original Cindy episodes, where it was very 
home-made looking,' she said.

Style is set to return this fall

'Everything seemed so raw, and so real. It was so 
inspired by music, street style, art, and everything around the people 
who were making it.'

She added: 'House Of Style seemed to be the one thread that was 
connecting everything in those early episodes. It showed exactly what 
was going on backstage. It was the first time something like that 
happened.'

Both models admit their strength as a host duo lies specifically in how well they know each other.

Miss Smalls said: 'We get to work a lot together and I think that dynamic really shows. People should see that.'

Miss Kloss agreed, adding: 'Yeah, Joan and I... we are both very young, but we have done a lot. And we know each other very well and have a sense of camaraderie.'

The new House of Style will run 
across all of MTV's multi-media platforms, including television, the 
web, and on iPhone apps.

Infusing the show's original off-the-cuff 
feeling, the new episodes will go
backstage with the models while also featuring culturally relevant segments
on music, fashion, and design
