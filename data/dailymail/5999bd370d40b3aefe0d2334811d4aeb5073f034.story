An 80-year-old grandfather has had an equal sign tattooed on to his wrist to show solidarity with his gay grandson.

Grandfather Frank was filmed as he got the tattoo, a month after his grandson Joe got the same symbol tattooed on to his abdomen.

In the video, Frank explains how his grandson Joe came out to him about five years ago and says the pain of the tattoo 'is nothing [compared] to what my grandson went through when he first came out'.
