Sagging breasts, a wrinkly face, thread veins and thinning hair.

They all sound like signs of aging that women in their 70s might be worrying about.

But apparently we all begin to fret about theses physical quandaries much, much, much earlier than that: at the age of just 29.

Yes, a woman's battle to grow old gracefully begins at the end of her twenties, according to new research.

Growing old gracefully? Saggy boobs become a real worry for women after the age of 29 - the age Cheryl Cole is now- a new study reveals

Looking good: Both Cheryl Cole, left, and Mila Kunis, right, look terrific at 29 years old, but research shows that is the age when women begin to fret about the physical signs of ageing

Which means Miranda Kerr, Cheryl Cole, Mila Kunis, Emily Blunt and Agyness Deyn - all on the cusp of turning 30 - are likely to already be panicking about age spots, thinning lips and facial hair.

Having
spent their teens trying to look older than they actually are, women 
finally become happy with their appearance in their early twenties. But all that changes at 29.

At
29 women become more concerned about trying to look young again, amid 
fears of wrinkles, sagging boobs, bingo wings and crow's feet. They also tend to find their first grey hair. In fact, some 33 per cent of women fret about going grey, and thinning hair is a major worry for three in 10.

Time delay: Is 29-year-old Miranda Kerr, left, already worried about getting old, right?

A
third of women say a sagging bottom keeps them awake at night, while 29
per cent want to avoid a wrinkly cleavage at all costs.

The study shows other top ageing fears for ladies include facial hair, a middle aged spread and thread veins.

Developing double chins, age spots, wrinkly hands and thinning lips also feature in the catalogue of concerns.

To combat these signs of ageing, the average female reckons she spends up to 12 
minutes each day applying the necessary creams and 
make up.

That's the equivalent of 73 hours a year, or three entire days dedicated to the skincare and beauty routine.

Indredibly, more than one in ten women feel they look older than they are by an average of six years.

But six in 10 ladies feel younger than their years, and claim good make-up and skin care routines cause this.

Indeed, 45 per cent of respondents 
are lucky enough to regularly receive compliments about how young they 
look, and believe it is worth making a concerted effort to look younger.

Andrew Groom is Buying Director of 
Superdrug, the company which conducted the study of 2,000 women.

Mr Groom said: 'It is incredible to
think that those who are still in the prime of their life at 29 are 
already worrying about the effect ageing will have on their face and 
body.

'That said, it's really 
never too early to take care of your skin, and today's women are lucky 
that products on our shelves really work.

'A quick skincare routine started at 29 really will combat the signs of ageing and it's got to be worth the effort.'

Superdrug's new Optimum 
PhytoCellTecTM skincare collection utilizes stem cell technology from 
rare apples and grapes to help combat the signs of ageing.
