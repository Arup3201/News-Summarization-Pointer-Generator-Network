Most parents would be delighted if their 11-year-old son was always laughing and smiling.

But for James Edgar's mother Rachel, his constantly happy nature is a simply a reminder of the difficulties life may hold for him.

James was born with Angelman syndrome - a chromosome disorder which causes severe learning difficulties.

And the rare neurological condition has a
 side-effect that means sufferers tend to be easily excited and are left 
almost permanently laughing or smiling.

Happy: James Edgar, with mother Rachel, suffers from a rare neurological condition which means he cant stop smiling or laughing

So while the youngster, from Caernarfon, North Wales, appears to be the happiest child in the world, he actually experiences intellectual and developmental delay, seizures and jerky movements.

Fewer then 1,000 cases of Angelman syndrome have been reported in the UK.

James's mother, Rachel Martin, said: 'James is such a happy, lovable, cuddly child. But he needs constant supervision as he is not aware of danger.

'He may appear happy, but he does feel other emotions, even if he doesn't show it.

'That's not to say there aren't moments when he's challenging, but he's such a pleasure to be around.'

Communicating:  While James is unable to talk, he is able to express himself through his iPad and uses apps tell stories to family and friends

James was diagnosed when he was 17 months old after doctors had monitored him because of his lack of progression.

His mother said: 'When he was diagnosed, we were upset  - although not entirely surprised as we had thought that James had a disability for some time.

'When you receive confirmation that your child had a disability, all your plans for the future change instantly.

'As a parent you have subconscious expectations for your child that are not going to be realised, and some parents go through a period of loss, almost like grieving, for the child they thought you were going to have.'

James is unable to talk, but he is able to express himself through his iPad.

Rachel says he uses several apps to tell stories at school and also bring stories home to share with family.

She said: 'The iPad is amazing - it has helped him so much. 'His favourite site is YouTube, he can spend all day on it. He particularly loves the Disney Parades and Chapstick video.

'He has brought immense joy and happiness to our family and while I would happily take away the challenges he faces in life, I wouldn't want to change him. He is who he is - just James!'

James lives at his home with his 
siblings Alexandria, 15, Zac, seven and Beth six, who, says Rachel, are 
all very good at helping.

Rachel is the chair of the Angelman Syndrome Support Education and Research Trust.

One in a million: James's mother Rachel said he she would happily take away the challenges he faces in life, but would never want to change his personality

She said: 'Since James was diagnosed I've been involved with the trust.

'It allows families to meet and learn about the syndrome and gives national support to those involved.'

Now, the Newlife Foundation, an organisation set to help disabled children, is fundraising to help the youngster.

They hope to raise £5,000 in addition to the £2500 already donated to fund a specialist bed for James to control his complex behaviours.

Angelman Syndrome is a rare genetic condition first identified in 1965 by a British doctor, Harry Angelman.

Dr
 Angelman had noticed similarities between a small number of previously 
undiagnosed children that seemed to indicate they had a common problem. 

After
 seeing a painting in the Castelvecchio museum in Verona, Italy, entitled
 A Boy with a Puppet he was inspired to write a medical paper entitled 
Puppet Children.

The
 syndrome - originally called 'Happy Puppet Syndrome' because of the 
characteristic happy demeanour and stiff jerky movements of the children
 - was renamed Angelman Syndrome in 1982.

Although at first little was known and indeed few other cases identified, in recent years much more has been learned. 

During
 the 1980s advances in genetic medicine made it possible to diagnose 
increasing numbers of cases and also to start identifying the cause.

In simple terms, it is a chromosome disorder that causes severe learning difficulties. 

Angelman
 Syndrome is not a disease, it is a neurological disorder that causes 
severe learning difficulties, and although those affected have a normal 
life expectancy, they will require looking after throughout their lives. 

Most
 AS children are diagnosed between the ages of three and seven when the 
characteristic physical and behavioural features become evident.For more information visit: www.angelmanuk.org/angelman_syndrome.html
