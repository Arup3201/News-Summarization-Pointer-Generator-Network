Barcelona defender Dani Alves is close to agreeing terms to join another club this summer, according to the player's agent Dinorah Santana.

The Brazil international's contract with the Catalan club is due to expire at the end of the season and he will be free to leave for nothing.

Alves had been willing to remain at Barcelona but the club have not offered him an extension to his deal and has been free to talk with other clubs outside of Spain since January.
