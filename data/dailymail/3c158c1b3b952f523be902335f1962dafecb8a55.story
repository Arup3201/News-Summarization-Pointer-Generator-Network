Wigan coach Shaun Wane is hoping a series of cross-code training sessions with Bath can help kick-start his side's Super League campaign.

The Warriors, who go into Friday's home game against Wakefield on the back of just two wins from their first six matches, have spent two days on a shared training camp at Orrell with Mike Ford's Premiership outfit.

Wane, who reciprocated Bath's hospitality from last August, says his kickers picked up tips from their rugby union counterparts and that all his players will have benefited from lining up against the unknown in opposed training sessions.

Wigan Warriors head coach Shaun Wane has been pleased with his side's training sessions with Bath 

'They looked after us last year at Bath and when we came back we went on a decent run in the play-offs so it paid off,' Wane said. 'We wanted to return the favour and we've had a great couple of days with them.

'We're running against players who don't know our systems so it's been really beneficial. We run against our 19s every day and they know what we're going to do so it's been a big help that way.

'We're trying to get benefits for both clubs. It was important to me that we got something out of and it wasn't all about them learning from us.'

Bath head coach Mike Ford invited Wigan to come train with his side at the Rec in August
