Harry Potter fans have been offered a glimpse into the teenage wizard’s future after JK Rowling resurrected her hero for a new short story that reunites him with his old friends at a Hogwarts School reunion.

The 1,500-word story, published on the writer’s Pottermore website, describes the now 34-year-old Harry as having 'threads of silver' in his black hair.

Ron Weasley, played in the hit films by Rupert Grint, has aged less well with his ginger hair 'thinning slightly'.

He is revealed to be co-manager of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes with his brother George after working for two years at the Ministry of Magic.

His wife Hermione, Harry’s wife Ginny, and their children all feature in the story. The supremely capable Hermione is now Deputy Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.

Rowling also gives fans a hint of Harry’s new life by describing a mysterious cut over his cheekbone, perhaps related to his membership of a top-secret group of wizards called the Aurors.

The story is set during a Quidditch tournament - the fictional sport played by the student wizards on flying broomsticks in the best-selling books that is so popular with fans that they have adapted a version of the game that can really be played.

Protege: Harry Potter's son Albus, pictured here in the final film of the series, is also mentioned in the short story

It is written in the form of an article 
by Rita Skeeter, a gossip columnist for the Daily Prophet newspaper 
featured in the books.

Rowling hit the headlines recently when she stated her support for a No vote in the Scottish independence referendum, a £1 million donation to Better Together and a blog detailing the “serious risks” of independence.

The Harry Potter author, who lives in Edinburgh, has just published her second crime thriller under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.

The story, 'Dumbledore's Army Reunites At Quidditch World Cup Final', is written as a feature by Daily Prophet muckraker Rita Skeeter, who is at the Quidditch World Cup Final being held in the Patagonian Desert in Argentina.

Harry and his cohorts are revealed to be special guests at the event and are still massive celebrities in the wizarding world. Skeeter described scenes of pandemonium as Harry et al arrive.

The wizard is described as having 'threads of silver' in his dark hair and is still wearing his distinctive round glasses. He is also described as having a scar on his cheek, which the journalist speculates is related to his work as an auror. His wife Ginny is revealed to be a reporter - somewhat jealously by rival Skeeter - for the Prophet reporting on the final.

Harry also warmly greets former rival and Bulgarian Quidditch player Viktor Krum.

After two years at the Ministry of Magic, Ron Weasley is now the co-owner of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes with his brother George. His famous red hair is 'thinning slightly'.

His wife, high flyer Hermione, has risen 'meteorically' to the position of Deputy Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and is tipped for even greater things.

Neville Longbottom is shown to be a professor of Herbology at Hogwarts, while Dumbledore's Army stalwart Luna Lovegood is married to a famous magizoologist.

Rowling made her name with the Harry Potter books, but has recently seen her second detective novel released under her pseudonym Robert Galbraith

The real identity of Robert Galbraith 
was revealed last year and sent the first novel, The Cuckoo’s Calling, 
to the top of book charts.

She accepted a substantial donation to charity from the law firm which breached her confidentiality by revealing she was writing under a pseudonym.

Only a handful of trusted advisers, family and friends were initially aware of Galbraith’s true identity until the story made headlines worldwide.

The novel 
and the film of Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, the last in the 
series, closes with a brief epilogue set 19 years after Harry defeats 
Voldemort.

We see Harry and Ginny Weasley with their three children, while Ron and Hermione Weasley have two children.

The
 families meet at King's Cross station, where Harry's son Albus will 
depart from Platform 9 and 3/4 for his first year at Hogwarts.

Harry
 sees Draco Malfoy and his wife with their son, Scorpius and it is 
revealed that their school friend Neville Longbottom is now a Hogwarts 
professor.

The book's final words are: 'The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.'
