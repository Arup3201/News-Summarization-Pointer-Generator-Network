Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso has stepped down as CEO of the global e-commerce company having already chosen her own replacement.

The 30-year-old, whose debut book #GirlBoss is a New York Times best-seller, announced the news to her staff on Monday, naming the online retailer's current president, Sheree Waterson, as her successor.

Miss Amoruso told Re/code that she made the decision on her own, noting that she will continue to serve as Nasty Gal's executive chairman and oversee the company's creative and brand marketing teams.

The community college dropout, who turned an eBay shop into a $100 million fashion empire, explained that she wanted the growing company to have a CEO with operational expertise, who would take the company to 'the next level of maturity'.

'I'm not even a parent,' Miss Amoruso joked. 'I hope to someday be the leader that Sheree is.'

Perhaps Miss Amoruso will use her new found free time to plan her wedding; she announced her engagement to her longtime partner, whose name is not known, on Instagram in June of last year. 

The change in leadership comes on the heels of Nasty Gal's most challenging year. Although the online retailer opened its first brick-and-mortar location on Melrose Avenue in 2014, the company's rapid growth has slowed and 10 per cent of the staff were fired last summer. 

Ms. Waterson, who is now joining the company's board, was hired as president of the brand in late 2013. The former Lululemon chief product officer joined Nasty Gal after the athletic wear company's see-through-pants controversy.

'It's been a long time coming, but I'm stoked to announce that I've promoted Sheree Waterson, Nasty Gal's President now for a year, to CEO,' Miss Amoruso wrote Monday on her Instagram account.

'I can't wait to unleash my talents and hang with our customers in new ways and to unleash Sheree's insanely bonkers leadership talent on our team.'

She noted: 'This is the kind of partnership dreams are made of. And for the record, I ain't going nowhere.'

Nasty Gal board member Danny Rimer said stepping down was really something Miss Amoruso wanted to do.

'She said to me, "I see that there are two customers of Nasty Gal. The customer that is girl and customer that is employee. I want to focus on the girl."'

He added: 'It shows a level of maturity that she knows what she can do well and what others can do better than her.'
