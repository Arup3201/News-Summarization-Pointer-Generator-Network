Creed front man Scott Stapp has repeatedly called 911 in recent weeks claiming that his family’s safety is at risk from unspecified forces who are out to kill him

Creed front man Scott Stapp has repeatedly called 911 in recent weeks claiming that his family’s safety is at risk from unspecified forces who are out to kill him.

The singer has suffered a series of very public meltdowns that started last month when he posted a video on Facebook claiming that the IRS had taken all his money and he was broke and living in a Holiday Inn.

Stapp’s wife Jaclyn has asked a judge in Palm Beach County, Florida, to have her husband admitted to a substance abuse facility at the same time as she filed for divorce from the 41-year-old singer.

She claims Stapp has been using drugs including amphetamines, cocaine and Ketamine and that he has threatened to kill himself and harm his family.

The latest 911 recordings, released by TMZ, feature several calls made by Stapp from the side of a Florida highway in which he can be heard telling the dispatcher that ‘someone is trying to kill me’.

In the first recording, the With Arms Wide Open singer complains that he has called 911 eight times and no one has showed up.

The singer then explains that he has been on the run for six or seven weeks to try to keep ‘them’ away from his family.

When asked who he is running from, Stapp simply says: ‘I don’t know’.

The singer made the call on foot after abandoning his vehicle. When he reaches the first responders he repeatedly asks them to take him to the hospital because he has chest pains.

He also says he wants a blood test so no one can accuse him of doing drugs.

In a second recording Stapp, who fronted one of the most successful rock acts of the 1990s, tells the same dispatcher that 15 vehicles are following him and he's been on the run for 36 hours straight.

He again asks to be taken to the hospital and complains of feeling dizzy, dehydrated and malnourished.

The other audios clips include Stapp leaving a message last month for the dean of his son’s school last month.

As previously reported, Stapp warns that ISIS are set to attack Florida which he knows because the terrorists are members of his family.

In the fourth clip Stapp claims his wife Jaclyn has stolen his truck and he also says that she has threatened to  blackmail him.

Stapp's increasingly erratic behavior has lead a Florida judge has granted his estranged wife sole physical and legal custody of their three children: Jagger, 16, Milan, 7, and Daniel, 4.

The judge also ruled that Stapp cannot return to the family home, and that the residence is solely for his estranged spouse and their children. 

In a separate 911 recording which emerged last week, Stapp's wife told a 911 dispatcher that he husband believes he is an undercover CIA agent charged with assassinating President Obama.

The call was placed last month not long after the singer had been released from a 72-hour psychiatric hold in Florida.

Stapp had taken off on a bicycle and disappeared - causing his panicked wife and sister-in-law to phone the police to try and get them to commit him again.

'He thinks he's part of the CIA,' Jaclyn Strapp told the dispatcher. 'He thinks they're trying to kill him, and he has a bunch of paperwork in his backpack that he's a CIA agent and he is supposed to assassinate Obama', said her sister.

They implored the dispatcher to get an officer after Stapp, who was cycling shirtless around his Florida neighborhood, carrying a backpack of tools and 600 pages of CIA documents he printed from the internet.

'He's off the drugs, and he's going crazy,' said Jaclyn Strapp's sister to the 911 dispatcher. 

But, when police found him they decided he was in control of his faculties and declined to commit him.

In November, Stapp revealed he was broke and homeless in a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video post.

'Right now I'm living in a Holiday Inn by the grace of god, because there's been a couple weeks where I had to sleep in my truck,' the 41-year-old rocker admitted on camera.

'I had no money not even for gas or food. I went two days without eating because I had no money and I ended up in an emergency room.'

The Grammy winner - whose net worth was once $10M - sold an estimated 53 million records worldwide with his neo-grunge band in their nineties heyday.

'All hell broke loose' around two months ago when the IRS audited Scott's record company and personal finances.

'The IRS has frozen my bank accounts two or three times to leave me completely penniless,' Stapp stated.

'I don't even understand that, why all this is happening at the same time. When I called to find out why, they said, "Oh we had an address mix-up, it was a clerical error, so we'll return your funds in nine to 10 months." I don't understand how that's fair America.'

Cryptic: He also posted a message to Facebook last Friday saying it was his 'last statement' 

The singer also claimed 'someone' used his passwords to transfer all the money out of his bank accounts.

'A lot of things were uncovered. A lot of money was stolen from me, or royalties not paid,' Scott continued.

'There are people that have taken advantage and stolen money from me and they're trying to spread vicious lies and discredit me.'

And at the end of the month, Jaclyn Stapp had her estranged husband admitted to a substance abuse facility.

The former Miss New York USA beauty queen claimed her husband has been using several drugs and threatened to kill himself and harm his family.

Jaclyn said he left their home in early October.

'It is a very painful and personal matter for the family,' said Jason Brodie, Jaclyn Stapp's attorney.

'Jaclyn loves Scott very much. It is now apparent the seriousness of Scott's health. Jaclyn has taken all the necessary steps to help him,' Brodie said.

'She previously arranged for the appropriate treatment and will continue to try and help him. Her primary concern remains the best interest of their children. Jaclyn asks for privacy for her and her children during this difficult time,' the attorney added.

The couple married eight years ago and have three children.
