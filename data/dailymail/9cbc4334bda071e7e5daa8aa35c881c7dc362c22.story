Adrian Peterson has pledged never to use a switch to discipline his child again and revealed that he called his son last week, the first time he's spoken to him in five months.

The Minnesota Vikings running back was charged with felony child abuse in Texas for using a wooden switch to discipline his four-year-old son. He pleaded no contest  to misdemeanor reckless assault earlier this month.

But the NFL star, who's been on paid leave from the Vikings for more than two months, told a newspaper that he 'won't ever use a switch again', that he has been seeing a therapist and meeting a pastor certified in counseling near his Houston-area home, and has learned other ways to discipline his children.

Adrian Peterson has pledged never to use a switch to discipline his child again

He told USA Today: 'I won't ever use a switch again. There's different situations where a child needs to be disciplined as far as timeout, taking their toys away, making them take a nap. There's so many different ways to discipline your kids.'

He added: 'No one knows how I felt when I turned my child around after spanking him and seeing what I had left on his leg. No one knows that Dad sat there and apologized to him, hugged him and told him that I didn't mean to do this to you and how sorry I was.'

Peterson said that he phoned his son last week. During the emotional call, the first conversation between the pair since June, his son said 'I love you, Dad. Can I come over to your house?' 

He also revealed that he may move on from the Vikings, as it might be best for both him and the team. 

Peterson said he believes the coaches and players on the team are fully behind him but that feelings in the organization toward him are mixed.

'I know who loves me. The coaches and the players, it's not going to be a problem. I've felt so much support from those guys. The organization, I know there's people in the organization that support me and there's people that I know internally that has not been supporting me,' Peterson told the newspaper. He said he has given a lot of thought to the idea that 'maybe it's best for me to get a fresh start somewhere else.'

'I would love to go back and play in Minnesota to get a feel and just see if my family still feels comfortable there. But if there's word out that, hey, they might release me, then so be it. I would feel good knowing that I've given everything I had in me.' 

On paid leave from the Vikings for more than two months, Peterson was informed this week by the NFL he will be suspended without pay for at least the rest of the season. The NFL Players Association has appealed the punishment on his behalf, and Peterson will continue to draw his salary on the exempt list until the appeal is resolved.

Regardless of which team he plays for next year, assuming he's reinstated by the league, Peterson said his focus has been on family — restoring his relationship with the boy and becoming a better parent. Peterson has fathered six children by six different women. He was married July 19.

Peterson said he declined to meet with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last week because of unanswered questions he and the union had about the process.

'I didn't want to go into a situation blind. I didn't know what to expect. Who's going to be there? Who will I be meeting with? What details are we going to get into?' he said.

Peterson also said he was upset by Goodell's accusation in the letter about the suspension that he showed 'no meaningful remorse' about injuring the boy.

'Ultimately, I know I'll have my opportunity to sit down with Roger face to face, and I'll be able to say a lot of the same things that I've said to you,' Peterson told the newspaper. 'Don't say that I'm not remorseful, because in my statement, I showed that I was remorseful. I regretted everything that took place. I love my child, more than anyone could ever imagine.'
