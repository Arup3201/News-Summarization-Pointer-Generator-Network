Dark chocolate is rich in flavanols, which can lower blood pressure - although these can also be found in blueberries, tomatoes and onions

Enjoying dark chocolate could have the added benefit of lowering blood pressure, researchers
claim.

A review of studies involving nearly a thousand people found
those consuming up to 100g of chocolate with a high cocoa content had a
significant drop in their blood pressure.

Researchers believe the antioxidant compound flavanol is the
active ingredient providing heart benefits, according to a review published in
The Cochrane Library.

These findings follow a study earlier this week suggesting
that cocoa may benefit the brain in old age and protect against diseases such
as Alzheimer’s.

Scientists reviewed data from 20 short-term trials in which
850 participants were involved and discovered those who consumed up to 100g of
flavanol-rich chocolate or cocoa powder a day significantly reduced their blood
pressure when compared to those who consumed flavanol-free products. 

Flavanol contains nitric oxide which causes blood vessels in
the body to dilate and relax resulting in a drop in blood pressure.

Its health benefits were first recognised when it was
revealed that indigenous people who drank cocoa every day from San Blas Island
in Central America have normal blood pressure regardless of age.

Cocoa is found in much higher concentrations in dark than
milk chocolate.

UK Blood Pressure Association Trustee, Professor Gareth
Beevers said: ‘Increasing your flavanol intake may be beneficial if you have a
high blood pressure however I wouldn’t recommend it for people suffering from
cardiovascular diseases who should stick to traditional treatments.’

People with high blood pressure, which affects 1 in 3 adults
in the UK, are three times more likely to develop heart disease and stroke than
those with a healthy blood pressure. 

Ideally adults’ blood pressure should be below 140/85 mmHg.

Around 30 per cent of people in England have high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart attack and stroke

The top number measures systolic pressure, which corresponds
to the surge of blood that occurs with every heartbeat.

The results of the study show that flavanol-rich chocolate
reduced blood pressure by up to 4 mmHg of systolic pressure which could make a
difference for someone with high blood pressure who may need medication.

But don’t reach for the chocolate bar just yet - flavanol
can also be found in diet friendly foods such as blueberries, tomatoes and
onions as well as green tea.

Professor Beevers adds: ‘I would also prioritise restricting
salt in your diet if you are trying to lower your blood pressure as the data
from these studies are more powerful.’

Additionally the amount of flavanol varies greatly depending
on the type of chocolate, which means milk chocolate lovers may be
disappointed.

High cocoa content, low sugar chocolate came out top in
terms of reducing blood pressure with overweight and obese participants
experiencing greater reductions in blood pressure after consuming low sugar
chocolate.

Lead researcher Karin Ried, from the National Institute of Integrative Medicine in Melbourne, Australia said: ‘The small reduction we saw over the short term might
complement other treatment options and might contribute to reducing the risk of
cardiovascular disease. 

‘We’ll also need to see long term trials, including effects
on the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease, before we can come to
conclusions regarding clinical outcomes and potential side effects of long-term
consumption.'
