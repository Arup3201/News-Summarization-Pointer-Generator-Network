The cheapest area in Britain: House-hunters only need A £14,470 deposit to buy a property in Blackburn

Britain's most expensive area: Aspiring home owners need an average of £70,000 in savings to buy in London

Homebuyers in Blackpool need a deposit of just £15,707 and while those in Oldham need £16,386.

Northern towns and cities dominate a list of areas where property deposits are lowest, including Bolton, Hartlepool, Bradford and Darlington.

Analysis of 30 cities and regions in England and Wales shows the average deposit needed to put down is 20 per cent of the purchase price of a property - equating to an average of £26,468.

But homebuyers in London need an average of £72,760 in savings or equity to secure a 20 per cent deposit.

This is almost double the second most expensive area to buy, Reading, where buyers on average need deposits of around £39,789.

Costly: Researchers surveyed 30 cities and regions in England and Wales to find the average deposit needed to buy a property in Britain - currently £26,468

The research was commissioned by mortgage provider Castle Trust.

Sean Oldfield, chief executive officer, said: 'Parents and grandparents are being called on more and more to help children with their first deposit and the proportion of the population owning their own home without family help is likely to continue to fall.

'Aspiring homeowners need alternatives to borrowing from family which is why the Government has launched a range of initiatives including NewBuy and FirstBuy.

'However, private companies need to play a role as well in offering innovative and affordable ways to help those who want to buy homes and Castle Trust is determined to play its part with housing investment and shared equity products.'
