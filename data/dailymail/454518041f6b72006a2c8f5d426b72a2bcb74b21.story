An undertaker murdered his wife while enjoying an affair with a widow he seduced after arranging her late husband’s funeral, a court heard today.

John Taylor, 61, is accused of killing wife Alethea, six months in to the ‘intense’ affair with Alison Dearden, 53.

A court today heard he began bombarding the widow with text messages within weeks of Mr Dearden’s death.

Taylor even left red roses on her 
doorstep, a jury heard, and dipped into the marital joint bank account 
to buy a ‘love nest’ he planned to share with his mistress.

Mrs Dearden told the court she began 
sleeping with Taylor in July 2011, eight months after liaising with the 
funeral director over her husband David’s funeral.

The Taylors had known Mrs Dearden, who
lived in a nearby village, for 12 years, after first meeting at church,
the jury were told. But following Mr Dearden’s death Taylor began 
confiding in her about his ‘unhappy’ marriage, she said.

Taylor is charged with his wife’s 
murder even though no trace of the former teacher has been found since 
she was last seen at their home in January last year.

The court heard 
Mrs Taylor, 63, had discovered the affair, and had written that her 
husband had become ‘besotted with a certain little widow’.

Mrs Dearden told the court how in June
2011, Taylor arrived at her home with a card and two bottles of wine 
for her birthday, which was the following month.

On the day of her actual birthday, she
came home to find ‘some red roses on the doorstep’ of her cottage in 
Brimfield, Herefordshire.

Mrs Dearden added: ‘There was no note 
on them, but a few days later John rang me and asked if I had found some
red roses on my doorstep.

‘He asked me to go out for the day with him, and I asked him if he meant with Alethea. He said ‘no, just me’.

‘I think I said ‘John you are married 
it is not appropriate for me to go out with you on your own.’ I think I 
said to him to come over for coffee and talk to me about it.’

Mrs Dearden said that when Taylor then
came to her home, he ‘started to talk about his marriage to Alethea’, 
adding: ‘He just said they had lived ‘like brother and sister’ for five 
or six years and he was very unhappy.

‘He told me he could easily fall in love with me.’

She said the couple did eventually go out for the day, and said they ‘just seemed to click’.

As their relationship blossomed, they exchanged text messages, some of which were read out at Worcester Crown Court.

One, from August, five months before 
Mrs Taylor’s disappearance, read: ‘Can’t stop wanting to be with you - I
love you so much.’

Mrs Dearden said: ‘I felt dead when 
David died and then John came along and he brought me so much joy. It 
was a very intense relationship.’

But as the months wore on, the couple both became ‘frustrated’ by the situation.

‘I found it frustrating that I couldn’t see John when I wanted to and I felt very guilty and uncomfortable,’ she said.

‘He felt guilty about the lies - the 
lying at home.’ Mrs Dearden recalled how she had sent a ‘jokey’ text to 
Taylor at one point saying she had found them a seaside house and, asked
by Jonas Hankin, prosecuting, if she saw a future with Taylor, she 
replied ‘sometimes, yes’.

In a text Taylor sent her, he said: ‘I
don’t see how we will last till(sic) Christmas. I can’t last five 
months, I am so attracted to you.’

Mr Hankin asked Mrs Dearden what she thought that text meant.

She replied: ‘I think John was saying he was willing to leave Alethea by Christmas.’

The jury have been told that Taylor 
told the couple’s friends his wife vanished after developing ‘some kind 
of dementia’. But the court heard Mrs Taylor’s friends saw nothing in 
her behaviour to suggest she was losing her memory, and she had not 
confided in them about any such problems.

The prosecution said Taylor was ‘keen 
to spread around’ the idea his wife was ‘in some way, losing her mind’ 
to cover up for her disappearance.

Taylor, of Orleton, Herefordshire, denies murder.

The case continues.
