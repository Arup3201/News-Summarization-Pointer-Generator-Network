Nearly half of the Radio Rentals customers have been found to be on welfare payments, and they are not just renting household necessities. 

The ABC have reported that those who receive Centrelink payments made up half of Radio Rental's income last year. 

Of the $197 million of revenue they made, $90 million came from the bill-managing Centrelink service, Centrepay.

Centrelink's service, Centrepay is a voluntary bill paying service that helps to manage welfare funds

Of that $90 million in expenditure, $45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen televisions, smart phones, sound systems and other home theatre devices.

The shocking reality is that the consumer leasing company relies on revenue from the Australian welfare system.

A report released by finance company Credit Suisse has expressed that any change in the rules that regulate the consumer leasing industry would have a huge effect on Radio Rentals and their business.

Centrepay is a voluntary bill paying service offered by Centrelink and deducts welfare payments in manageable amounts in order to pay nominated bills.

Those bills can be toward rent, electricity, gas, water, ambulance or medical services and many more. 

This service aims to make budgeting easier for customers and caters to rental companies as it encourages smaller, broken up bills.

Consumer Action Law Centre chief executive officer Gerard Brody told the ABC that there have been worries about the white goods leasing market leader Radio Rentals for a while now.

'We have had long-held concerns about Radio Rentals and the consumer lease industry's use of the Centrepay system,' he said. 

Radio Rentals is currently Australia's leading household appliance, technology and furniture rental company and boasts that it gives everyone a 'fair go,' with no immediate deposits required.
