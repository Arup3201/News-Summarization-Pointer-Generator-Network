Malware and phishing scams are the scourge of the web.

Social networks and sites each have their own way of tackling the problem but from today, Facebook is hoping to pool this expertise into a single site.

It has set up a mini social network designed for security and cyber experts where they can share and learn about the latest threats facing their users.

ThreatExchange (pictured) builds on Facebook’s existing ThreatData tools currently used to discover and tackle scams and cybercrime. Partners will use it to share clues about malware and phishing scams. Early participants include Bitly, Dropbox, Pinterest, Tumblr, Twitter, and Yahoo

Called ThreatExchange, the site builds on Facebook’s existing ThreatData tools currently used to discover and tackle scams and cybercrime. 

'ThreatExchange enables security professionals anywhere to share threat information more easily, learn from each other’s discoveries, and make their own systems safer,' explained the site.

‘Threats like malware and phishing typically go after multiple targets, and a successful attack at one place usually makes it easier to take over systems elsewhere. We share in each other’s fate.'

It added that to 'be stronger together', companies need a more open approach to security to protect people's accounts and get rid of viruses.

It is built on the existing Facebook platform, but the site added layers to the service to let partners search through available threat information more easily. 

These firms can also post threat information and discoveries to other partners.

Threat data includes typically freely available information such as domain names sending out spam, or examples of malware, but Facebook has also built privacy tools into the system.

This means if a company only wants to share certain information with select companies known to be experiencing the same issues, they can limit who this data is shared with. 

Early partners include Bitly, Dropbox, Pinterest, Tumblr, Twitter, and Yahoo and Facebook said it expects new partners to join as the platform grows.

Mark Hammell, manager of the Threat Infrastructure team at Facebook said: ‘A little over a year ago, a group of technology companies came together to discuss a botnet that was spreading a malware-based spam attack on all of our services.

‘We quickly learnt that sharing with one another was key to beating the botnet because parts of it were hosted on our respective services and none of us had the complete picture.

Facebook said threats like malware and phishing (example of a tagging scam is pictured) typically go after multiple targets, and a successful attack at one place makes it easier to take over systems elsewhere. 'We share in each other’s fate. When one company gets stronger, so do the rest of us' explained the site

‘During our discussions, it became clear that what we needed was a better model for threat sharing.

‘We have a vested interest in making the internet safer and giving people better ways to connect and share.

‘After working with a number of our peer companies to refine the structure and implementation, we are ready to introduce ThreatExchange and see what we can learn from each other.’
