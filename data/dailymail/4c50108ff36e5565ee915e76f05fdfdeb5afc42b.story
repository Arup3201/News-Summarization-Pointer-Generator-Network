This dramatic video shows the terrifying
moment base jumper Jeb Corliss fell more than 200ft after a
leap in a wingsuit from the top of Table Mountain went horribly wrong.

The professional daredevil, 35, was
recovering in hospital today after breaking both his legs yesterday in the
catastrophic stunt.

The minute-long clip posted on YouTube
shows the American adrenaline junkie wearing a black wingsuit as he stands
on a cliff face on the iconic mountain in Cape Town, South Africa.

Corliss, who is known as the Birdman after
pulling off a string of similar stunts, can be seen leaping over the edge of
the mountain alongside a cameraman named in the film as Jeff Nebelkopf.

The shaky footage shows the pair jumping
over the cliff at the start of what was supposed to be a triumphant stunt in
which they would soar down to the ground below.

In fact, the men disappear from view for
just a few seconds before a series of pained human groans are heard from below.

Clad in the wingsuits, they would shortly disappear from view

As it becomes evident the stunt has gone
desperately wrong, a bystander than exclaims 'F***, he's gone down'.

The footage, filmed from the top of the
3,500ft mountain, later shows Corliss being airlifted to hospital.

Doctors said the experienced base jumper
only survived the terrifying fall by deploying his emergency parachute in the
seconds before he smashed into the rock face.

He was treated yesterday at a private
hospital in Cape Town, where he today remained in a stable condition.

Jeb Corliss is now in a stable condition in hospital. He is seen here celebrating last September after zooming in a wingsuit through a gap in a mountainside in Hunan Province, China

Michelle Norris, spokeswoman for the
Christiaan Barnard Memorial Hospital, confirmed he needed surgery after
breaking both of his legs in the fall.

Corliss was filming a documentary for the
American TV network HBO when the accident happened.

Colleagues said they believed the
experienced jumper may have caught a gust of wind as he plunged from the
mountain.

The accident came during Corliss'
second jump in a week from Table Mountain.

The world-famous daredevil had previously
posted pictures of his first leap onto his website after achieving the feat last
week.

Corliss has made a name for himself as one
of the world's most daring base jumpers.

His previous achievements include jumping
from the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de
Janeiro.

Officials in South Africa have said the
California-born stuntman could face criminal charges over a fine following his
Table Mountain leap.

A spokeswoman for the flat-topped mountain
said base jumping was banned there due to safety concerns.
