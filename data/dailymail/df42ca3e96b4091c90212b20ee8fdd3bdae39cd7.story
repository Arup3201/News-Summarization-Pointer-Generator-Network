A crackdown on sham marriages could herald the end of the ‘shotgun wedding’.

The current period giving notice of a ceremony is to be virtually doubled from 15 days to 28.

The move - part of the Immigration Bill announced yesterday - is designed to give immigration officials enough time to investigate whether a proposed union is genuine.

Most sham marriages in Britain involve an EU national with the right to be here marrying someone from outside the EU.

But the notification rules will apply equally to all couples - including two Britons - to comply with equality laws.

Marriage campaigners welcomed the shift, saying it would help ensure marriages were built on firm foundations.

Harry Benson of the Marriage Foundation said: ‘This is good news for all couples. There is lots of evidence that whirlwind romances are more likely to end in tears than couples who spend more time thinking about it.’

The Home Office estimates that some 10,000 applications to stay in Britain a year are based on a ‘false’ wedding or civil partnership.

The change was detailed in the Immigration Bill published by the Home Office yesterday, which ministers insist will make it harder for illegal immigrants to set up home in the UK.

Illegal migrants will be banned from getting driving licences, opening bank accounts and renting private homes, with new checks imposed on bank managers, landlords and driving instructions.

It will also be easier to remove foreign criminals from Britain, refuse them bail and even kick them out first and ‘hear their appeal later’.

The sham marriage changes are a major new plank of efforts to fight a serious problem for the authorities.

Under existing rules, anyone who wants to marry must tell their local register office or church 15 days before the planned wedding date, and details of the union are then posted on a notice board.

From next year, this period will be extended to 28 days.

The new rules will allow officials who suspect a bogus wedding may be about to take place to extend the notice period to 70 days - allowing them to investigate.

Astonishingly, existing rules restrict the ability of officials from sharing information with the Home Office when they suspect a bogus union is about to take place. These will be scrapped.

Foreign nationals from outside the EU wanting to get married in a church will first have to go to the register office and get approval - ensuring the authorities are made aware of the planned wedding.

From 2005, migrants from outside the EU were required to obtain a certificate of approval from the Government before they could marry.

But this was abolished in 2011 after a court ruled in breached human rights laws. Since then the problem of sham weddings has raised major concerns.

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘Sham marriages have for too long been an easy target for migrants seeking to circumvent our immigration rules, often assisted by organised criminals.

‘Registrars are frustrated when they marry couples who are obviously sham; we need more effective tools to deal with it.

‘By extending the marriage and civil partnership notice period to 28 days in England and Wales and allowing this to be increased to 70 days in some circumstances we will make time to investigate, prosecute and remove those involved in sham marriages.’
