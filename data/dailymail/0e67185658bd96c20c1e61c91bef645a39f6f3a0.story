The WNBA playoff game between the Pheonix Mercury and the Minnesota Lynx took an unexpected turn last night on the Minnesota court.

After a scuffle between Diana Taurasi of the Pheonix Mercury and Seimone Augustus of the Minnesota Lynx, Taurasi shocked the crowd by planting a kiss on her opponent's cheek.

Both players received double personal fouls for their heated exchange. Both also also had a sense of humor about their 'dance' on the court.

'As far as me and Diana and the tango dance that we had, I always say she just wanted some of my deliciousness,' Augustus joked to reporters.

'I was just trying to make sweet love. That's about it,' Taurasi told reporters during a post game press conference.

Minnesota won 85-65. Taurasi commented on the opposition's win by saying, 'they took care of home court.'

The outward display of affection left fans wondering if the kiss was just a joke or if it meant something more.

The two players are not strangers. According to announcers, the two have been playing against one another since they were teenagers.

Taurasi and Seimone were also not always on opposite teams. The two were teammates on the gold medal-winning US Olympic team in London.

The sexual orientation of Taurasi is unknown, but in an interview with WNBA.com after being asked by a fan whether or not she had a boyfriend she said, 'I do NOT have a boyfriend, but I am looking for someone who is rich, is about 6-8 and drives a BMW 745 li.'

When asked if she has a celebrity crush, Taurasi answered, 'Yes, WNBA President Donna Orender.'

According to writer Kathy Belge at About.com, Diana Taurasi is known to make jokes and is often commended for having an outgoing personality.

Augustus is openly gay and has been a long time advocate for same sex sex marriage.

On coming out Augustus said, 'Everyone thinks that the WNBA is one big lesbo party anyway,' she said in an interview with the Associated Press. 'So I think the coming out process isn't as tough for us because people already expect it.'

Augustus is engaged to a woman named Lataya Varner and hopes to get married by the end of the season. Minnesota, a state that once banned gay marriage now allows the union after a bill passed by the Senate in May.
