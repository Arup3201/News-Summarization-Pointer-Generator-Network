Jane Fonda looked sensational at Cannes this week in a dazzling beaded Elie Saab gown.

But it will not have escaped keen-eyed fashion observers that we have seen the dress before, on the back of Angelina Jolie at the Oscars in March.

While the two women opted for different colorways (Ms Jolie chose a champagne hue, while Ms Foda’s was deep red), the gowns were nearly identical in shape, silhouette, and construction.

Double-take: Angelina Jolie (left) and Jane Fonda (right) have now both worn nearly identical Elie Saab gowns, with Ms Jolie wearing her's to the Oscars and Ms Fonda appearing in her's today at Cannes 

The only difference between the two 
gowns (aside from color) is how Ms Fonda’s gown is heavily beaded in a 
trumpet shape towards the bottom, and Ms Jolie’s has a softer hemline 
that somewhat resembles a tutu.

What
 is consistent is how well both women pull the design off – at 76, Ms 
Fonda manages to hold her own against the 38-year-old Ms Jolie.

Ms Fonda wore the gown with Chopard jewelry at the Cannes premiere of Grace of Monaco on Wednesday evening.

Ms
 Jolie, 38, wore her gown to the Oscars in March. She paired her look 
with neutral hair and make-up and fiancé Brad Pitt by way of arm candy 
(which, one might argue, gives her the edge).

The designs were both included in Elie Saab’s fall 2013 collection, which was presented in Paris.

Avid fans: Both Ms Jolie and Ms Fonda have been spotted in Mr Saab's gowns before, which were presented on the runway in Paris

Main definer: The only real difference between the gowns (aside from their color) is how Ms Jolie's hem is tutu-like and Ms Fonda's is heavily beaded

But
 neither women is a stranger to Mr Saab’s designs. Ms Fonda wore one of 
his resort 2014 black lace gowns to the Unite4 Humanity gala in February
 this year.

Ms Jolie wore a drapey, nude-colored gown of his design to The Palm Spring Awards in January 2012.
