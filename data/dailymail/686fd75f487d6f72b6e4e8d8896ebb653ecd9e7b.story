They are possibly the most famous pair of lovers ever.

But Romeo and Juliet may not be as well-matched as previously thought -if modern dating standards are anything to do by.

Match-making experts have analysed the psychological profiles of the Shakespearean duo and concluded that their love might not have been worth dying for after all.

Researchers subjected their personalities to the same analysis used to match modern-day couples.

They said the fictional lovers were poorly suited and added that Juliet would actually be better suited to Mr Darcy, the hero of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice.

Meanwhile, they said Romeo would have done much better with a girl like Bella Swan, played by Kristen Stewart in the Twilight films.

The pair were two of the 60 fictional characters studied by experts at the dating website eHarmony, which helps lonely hearts to meet like-minded potential partners.

The website uses an algorithm to match people with each other based on details they have uploaded onto their profile.

Each character was scored on key personality dimensions needed for a successful relationship, including emotional temperament, social style and relationship skills.

A spokesman said: ‘Romeo and Juliet wouldn’t have lasted too long as a couple. He is far too superficial for her in terms of the way he judges his partners and Romeo wouldn’t have understood Juliet’s needs or sympathised with her after the initial spark wore off.

‘Importantly, neither can depend on the people around them which would have a knock-on effect in terms of how they would trust each other in the long term.’

They added that Romeo and Bella Swan would be better suited because they both display neurotic characteristics.

Romeo's ideal lover would be Bella from Twilight

Sensitive and dependable Mr Darcy would make a great match for Juliet because both are conscientious and appreciate regularity in their lives.

Characters from Superman, Pride And Prejudice, EastEnders, Coronation Street, Star Wars and Twilight were included in the study.

Of those examined, the couple with the highest compatibility were Coronation Street legends Jack and Vera Duckworth.

Experts found the two had similar social styles, with loud-mouthed Vera and wise-cracking Jack working well as a pair.

Researchers also found high compatibility between people from different fictional couples.The most compatible was Superman’s Clark Kent had and Jane Eyre, the heroine of Charlotte Bronte’s classic novel.

Researchers said they both wanted to spend lots of time with their other half and regularly showed their partner how much they mean to them.

Jack Dawson from the film Titanic also had a high compatibility with Carrie Bradshaw from the hit TV show Sex in the City - mainly because of their mutual desire for physical attractiveness.

Other top matches were Peter Parker from Spiderman and Princess Leia from Star Wars, due to their willingness to help others.

Brooding Jane Eyre hero Mr Rochester and Bella Swan from Twilight were found to be a good pair because they are both introverted and anxious.

And church-going Harold Bishop from soap opera Neighbours was a good match for Belle in the fairytale Beauty and the Beast because they both exhibit kindness in their relationship.

Dr Steve Carter, eHarmony’s vice president of matching, said: ‘As experts in relationship compatibility, we were fascinated to see what would happen if we applied eHarmony’s science to fiction’s most beloved characters.

‘The findings show that, while on paper some couples seem well suited, when judging using the elements that really make a relationship work you get some truly intriguing pairings.’
