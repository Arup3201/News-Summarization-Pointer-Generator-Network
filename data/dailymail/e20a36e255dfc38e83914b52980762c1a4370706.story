Cengizhan Cerit, 47, known as Jem Cerit, needed ten residents to nominate him so he could stand as a candidate for Beaver Ward in the Ashford Borough Council by-election in November 2011.

But the wealthy businessman and former owner of Perfect Pizza in Ashford, faked the signatures on his election registration form and then tried to apply for hundreds of postal votes so he could rig the election. 

His cheating scheme was exposed by a simple spelling error - where a man was listed twice with two spellings of the name ‘Arnold’.

Canterbury Crown Court heard the 
Turkish property owner, who ran an empire of 68 houses with more than 
300 tenants, failed to spot the mistake in the Electoral Register.

Father-of-two
 Cerit was convicted by a jury of three charges of election fraud at 
Canterbury Crown Court today and has been warned he could face jail.

Alex Chalk, prosecuting, told the court: 'This is a case about misconduct in the democratic process.

'Cerit,
 a candidate standing for election, submitted electoral documents to the
 Electoral Services Department knowing that the signatures on those 
documents were false.

'Cerit was interviewed by the local Conservative Association on October 25 and selected as the Party’s candidate.

'He was provided with nomination forms and instructed to complete one of them within two days.

'The
 Conservative Party agent Gordon Williams returned to his office that 
morning and discovered the two forms had been delivered duly completed, 
even though only one had been necessary.

'On
 examination, however, he noted that two of the signatures looked the 
same - with only a difference in the spelling of ‘Arnold’ Madzianura.

'He queried this but Cerit reassured him they were two different people. That statement was false.'

The same day the forms were sent to the 
Electoral Services Department and officials noted the signatures 
appeared almost identical.

The prosecutor said that later checks revealed the second ‘Arnold’ - recorded as ‘Anorld’ at another address - didn’t exist.

Mr Chalk added: 'All, bar one, of the
 signatures on the first form were false. All six voters who could be 
contacted in respect of a second form confirmed that the signatures were
 false.'

Officials then received a list of 200 names and addresses in Beaver Ward wanting to register to make a postal vote just a week before the deadline.

He
 said: 'The information on these lists were found to be inaccurate 
because some of the individuals recorded as wanting postal votes already
 had them, some of them were recorded on both lists and other names were
 recorded as no longer being resident at the address.'

The court heard how CCTV later showed that it was Cerit who had delivered the postal vote applications to the council.

An investigation was launched and police raided a first floor office above ‘Perfect Pizza’ at in Ashford, Kent, and Cerit was arrested.

He was asked where the signatures came from and told officers: 'I send the guys around to get those people to sign.'

Mr Chalk added: 'When pressed on who the "guys" were, he mentioned Yanis or Cameron, adding later that "girlfriends" might have done so too.

'He said he had spoken to people on the forms and had said he was standing as a councillor and he expected their support.

'He stated that he had spoken to the individuals first and confirmed that they were happy to vote.'

The prosecutor said police had also 
questioned ‘the guys’, who included Cerit’s partner Oksana Nadeja, her 
sister Natalijia Ivanova and seven others, and 'all were able to state 
they had not been asked to fill in, deliver or collect, application 
forms'.

He added: 'Statements were later taken from some of the individuals whose names appeared on application documents for electoral registration by post - most were East European, Polish, Latvian and Rumanian - and they were able to confirm that the signatures on the documents were fake.'

Cerit, from Kingsnorth, Kent, stood for election in May 2011 and polled 335 votes - losing out to two other candidates who polled 481 and 479 votes.

But four months later one of the councillors, Brendan Naughton, died, which resulted in the need of a by-election.

Cerit, who denied the three charges, was remanded on bail until his sentencing on Friday.
