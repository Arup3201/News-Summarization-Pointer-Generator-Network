A leading academic has called for a wider inquiry into sexual abuse at music schools in the UK after a choirmaster and his ex-wife were convicted of abusing a former pupil.

Michael Brewer and his former wife Kay, both 68, were convicted of six counts of indecent assault.

Their victim, Frances Andrade, 48, a former pupil at Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester, killed herself with an overdose shortly after testifying against the pair.

Last night, an academic who was also a pupil at Chetham’s around the same time as Mrs Andrade, called for a wider inquiry into sexual abuse at music schools in the Seventies and Eighties.

Frances Andrade was abused by choirmaster Michael Brewer at Chetham's music school. Now academic Ian Pace says a wider investigation into music schools must take place

Ian Pace, a pianist and musicologist who lectures at City University in London, said the world of classical music was controlled by just a few influential people.

He said: ‘It is well known within the music world that there are many other such stories involving a variety of individuals in positions of power at various music schools.

‘Many of these people are extremely afraid to come forward with their stories, in a close-knit world of classical music in which careers are dependent upon the whims of a few powerful individuals.

‘A full independent inquiry into sexual and physical abuse in classical music education during this time is now absolutely paramount.’

Guilty: Michael Brewer was found guilty of indecently assaulting Frances after she won a place the music school where he was choirmaster. His ex-wife Hillary Brewer joined in with the abuse after Frances turned 18

Greater Manchester Police says it wants to hear from anyone who may have fallen victim to sexual abuse at the music school.

It has also defended its care of Frances Andrade during the trial at Manchester Crown Court.

The trial heard sexual abuse was ‘rife’ at elite music academy Chetham’s. Mrs Andrade told the court: ‘It was normal for us. Several friends of mine had been raped.’

Mr Brewer was director of music at Chetham’s when he began abusing his victim, then 14, in 1978.

Mrs Andrade was found dead at her Surrey home after giving evidence against the Brewers. Jurors were not told about her death until after they found the pair guilty of six counts of sexual assault.

Brewer and his ex-wife were remanded in custody and will be sentenced at a later date.
