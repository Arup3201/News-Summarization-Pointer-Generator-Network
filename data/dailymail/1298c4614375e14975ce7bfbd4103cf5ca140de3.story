Peter Greste's family are holding their breath for Egypt's president to deport the jailed Australian journalist after a court ordered a retrial.

An Egyptian court has ordered Greste and his two colleagues, Canadian-Egyptian Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohammed, be retried after more than a year in jail.

Greste's family is hopeful Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will honour a decree he issued in November which gives him the power to repatriate foreign prisoners detained in Egypt.

Greste's brother Andrew says the retrial presents a window of opportunity because Peter has become an accused, rather than a convicted, person.

 "It really opens up this option under the presidential decree," he said.

"Now that Peter is essentially an innocent man, he's not convicted anymore, it does allow for some room to move and for him (al-Sisi) to step in ... and deport them."

Peter Greste's lawyer has applied to the Egyptian attorney-general for deportation.

The retrial effectively means the original legal proceedings now count for nothing, international law expert Don Rothwell says.

"The ordering of a fresh trial is a real vindication, I think, for Greste, his legal team and others who have been pointing out the irregularities in the case," he said.

"It's reflective of a decision by the Egyptian legal system that they recognise there were flaws with the first trial."

  Andrew Greste said it was not clear how long the process would take.

"We've got to be hopeful. It's a new decree and there's very little understood about it, there's very little regulation, there's no precedent. We are in uncharted waters," he said.

"I'd like to think the decree was enacted to be used. We are going to test it out."

If deportation is unsuccessful, the family will apply for bail at the retrial.

Mike Greste said the past 12 months of fighting for his brother's freedom had been full of confusion and "trying to come to terms with a system we are totally unfamiliar with and having to take one day at a time". 

Their parents, Juris and Lois Greste, have been in Egypt for a month and are allowed to visit their son every 15 days but have not had a chance yet to talk to him about the latest events.

 Lois Greste said they were initially dismayed the court did not throw out the original conviction, but "despite some of our disappointments, I think overall it's been a good outcome today." 

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop agreed the court's decision was some cause for optimism.

"He's back in the position of an accused person awaiting a trial rather than a convicted person facing seven years in jail," she told ABC television on Friday. 

 The reporters were accused of aiding the blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood and spreading "false information" after the army ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013.

Greste and Fahmy were both sentenced to seven years, and Mohamed was jailed for 10.
