When it comes to their loved ones, most people are content to wear their hearts on their sleeves.

But one Spanish artist has taken the expression a step further by stitching portraits of his family, friends and girlfriend into the palms of his hands.

Artist David Cata, 21, uses his body as a canvas for his project Overexposed Emotions which illustrates how much the members of his family, including his girlfriend, Tamara, are woven into his life.

Spanish artist David Cata stitched portraits of his loved ones into the palms of his hands for an art project

The designs are supposed to show how each person we meet is woven into our lives, such as his Grandfather

Each picture, like this one of David's aunt, takes up to four hours to produce using a needle and thread

Each eye-watering artwork takes about four hours to complete, after which David, a music student and artist, films himself picking the stitches out of his hands.

Using a needle he very carefully pierces the top layer of his skin before drawing the thread through to create a stitch.

He then repeats the process with different coloured thread for up to four hours to create surprisingly detailed pictures of people who have influenced him.Â

David has so far created around 20 of the artworks featuring family members including his brother Javier (pictured)

After completing each picture David picks the needlework out of his hand before starting on the next one

And remarkably, an outline of each face is still visible in the picked flesh of his hand - but there is very little blood.

David,
 from Veriero, Spain, says the process doesn't hurt because it is only 
superficial, but admits that pain wouldn't bother him anyway.

'Every person we meet makes us in some way,' he said. 'Their image projects onto us, reminding us where we come from.

David has used coloured threat here to pick out the detail around his aunt Cuca's eyes and mouth

'By sewing into the palm of my hand I 
paint the faces of the people that have left their mark on my life: 
family, friends, partners, teachers.

'Their lives have been interwoven with mine to build my history. Pain is no boundary.'

Each portrait uses different coloured threads and intricate techniques to capture the resemblance of each individual family member.

David was probably cursing his grandmother Josefina's long hair while making this image of her

David claims that 'pain is no boundary' to his art, such as creating this picture of his father

Twenty pictures have so far been made, though David insists he will go no making more

But it is clear that the most detailed work goes into the eyes and mouth.

So
 far, he has stitched the likeness of his brother, Javier; his 
grandfather, Cata; his Aunt, Fe; his father; his girlfriend, Tamara; his
 grandmother, Josefina; his friend, Carlos; his teacher, Ciuco and many 
more.
