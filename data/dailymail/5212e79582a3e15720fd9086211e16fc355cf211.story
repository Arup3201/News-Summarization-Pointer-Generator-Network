Offensive rant: David lee, 48, told people to target businesses run by Muslims in a series of offensive messages posted on Facebook

A Facebook troll posted a series of vile messages telling people to attack businesses run by Muslims following the murder of soldier Lee Rigby.

David Lee, 48, who lives just a few streets away from Drummer Rigby's family, put the offensive rants on his social media page just 24 hours after the serviceman was brutally hacked to death.

In one offensive message, he wrote: 'If just one person petrol bombed any local Muslim business in their area that would be the end of them in one day.

'F*** off you cheeky ungrateful s**m. Allah is a coward just like you. Two can play your game you Allah a*** kissing s**m.

'Take a petrol bomb to the whole shop, light a fire and watch it burn.'

Most of the hate-filled message posted by the joiner from Middleton, Greater Manchester, are too offensive to reproduce.

The joiner was warned he could face jail after admitting posting the messages on Facebook at Bury Magistrates' Court today.

Police arrested Lee after they received an anonymous tip-off urging them to have a look at the Facebook page.

He claims to have known drummer Rigby who was murdered just 200 yards from his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London, last Wednesday.

When he was arrested he told police he was just joking in the posts.

'It was just a joke mate - I didn't mean it,' he told officers.

Stephanie Varle, prosecuting, said: 'He accepted that he had made the comments. It is clear that he didn't appreciate the serious nature of the things that he had said.

'Some of the comments clearly come across as offensive but it is not clear if anyone responded.

'Police were able to access this, it may have been an open profile so people who were not just the friends would have been able to access them.'

Another rant Lee posted about Muslims on his Facebook page said: 'F*** off now whilst you still can you 
cheeky vermin. Times are changing, I for one will fight back.

Murdered soldier: Drummer Lee Rigby whose family live just a few streets away from David Lee, 28

Referring to Rigby he said: 'We know 
the poor lad, it's awful. How many BNP or EDL members have murdered a 
man on the high, street filmed it, exulted in it and praised god as they
 did it? exactly.'

Lee was told he will be sentenced next month once reports have been carried out but he has been banned from using social networking sites immediately.

Remanding Lee on bail District Judge 
Paul Richardson said: 'I have to say that the prosecution was 
understandable reticent in reading out the remarks, when you hear them 
they are extremely offensive and inflammatory and I think I'm going to 
ask for an all options referral. I will not rule out a custodial 
sentence at this stage.

'You pleaded guilty which takes some 
courage but your situation is serious, the inflammatory comments that 
are published via a public communications networks like Facebook are 
serious.

'People do get to hear about it, what 
gets around, and it creates offensive and possible risk of public order.
 It goes as far as that. It shows the response of horrifying events it 
has got to be measures.

'Because of the nature of what you put
 on there a custodial sentence cannot be ruled out. I have got to ask 
for all options to be looked at.'

Lee admitted a single charge of improper use of public communications.
