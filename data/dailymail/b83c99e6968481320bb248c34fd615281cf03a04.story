Jailed for 14 years: Floyd Evans, 19, went on a drink and cocaine binge before arming himself with a knife

A homophobic teenager who left a gay man fighting for life after he stabbed him in the heart during a drug-fuelled ‘hunt’ for homosexuals was jailed for 14 years today.

Floyd Evans, 19, went on a drink and cocaine binge before arming himself with a knife and wandering over to a well-known meeting point for gay people on the Roman city walls in Chester.

He then used a trick to ambush 35-year-old Brazilian cleaner Francisco Nascimento while the victim was talking to another man - and plunged the knife into his chest.

The blade pierced Mr Nascimento’s heart and cut an artery. A policeman who arrived to help applied pressure to his wound before paramedics took him to a specialist trauma unit.

The victim was given life-saving surgery at the Royal Liverpool Hospital and was kept in for 11 days - four in intensive care. He has recovered physically but was left ‘mentally distraught’.

Evans - whose brother is gay - had deliberately gone to the crime scene to attack a homosexual for kicks, Chester Crown Court was told.

The teenager was arrested as he was about to take up a job at a council highways department. He was charged with attempted murder but convicted of the lesser charge of wounding with intent.

Giving him an increased sentence due to the stabbing being a ‘hate crime’, Judge Elgan Edwards said: ‘It is a terrible thing to see a man of just 19 - only 18 when you committed this crime - standing in the dock. But your behaviour that night was quite disgraceful.

‘You armed yourself with a knife, wandered round the streets of Chester and found your way deliberately to the walls at a place you knew well was a meeting point for homosexuals.

‘I’m quite satisfied this was [a] pre-meditated, homophobic attack - you did not have that knife on you for any other reason. All this man was doing was talking to his friend, but he ended up nearly dead.'

Earlier, the court had heard how Evans had a history of causing trouble and in the months before the attack made a 999 call in which he threatened to stab police officers and set them on fire.

He later claimed he only did it 
because he had a row with his brother about living arrangements and 
wanted to get himself arrested to have a free bed in police cells.

Sentencing: Judge Elgan Edwards said Evans had committed a 'pre-meditated, homophobic attack'

On
 the night of the stabbing on October 21 last year, Evans was drunk on 
lager and spirits and had been snorting cocaine in the toilets of a pub 
in the city.

Mr Nascimento, who has lived in the UK since 2005, had been shopping at a Tesco store in Chester but had decided to walk along the city walls, in the hope of finding ‘someone to talk to’.

He encountered a friend on the city walls
 named Gareth Davies, whom he chatted to for 40 minutes, but both 
noticed Evans approaching wearing a hat and a hoodie.

The teenager appeared to give a signal used by gay men but then attacked Mr Nascimento without warning. Police were alerted and an officer - who later won a commendation - gave emergency first aid whilst waiting for paramedics.

Evans calmly walked away after the attack but was arrested three weeks later after a policewoman identified him from CCTV footage taken on the night of the assault.

He denied carrying out the attack, saying: ‘I have no anti-gay views. Everyone is equal. My brother is gay and I’m perfectly happy with that.’

Violence: Evans 'went to the city walls that night because he thought his victim was gay, the local CPS said

He claimed cocaine made him ‘stupid not aggressive’, and said he could not remember carrying out any attack.

In a statement Mr Nascimento said he was suffering anxiety, paranoia and insomnia and is awaiting counselling. He is also reluctant to go swimming - something he did regularly before the attack - because of the scarring on his chest.

After the case, he said: ‘I hope that 
Floyd Evans realises that he could have been facing a murder charge had 
it not been for the lifesaving skills of the police, paramedics and 
surgeons.

‘I thank God and the amazing people 
who saved my life. I will never forget the incident and will always have
 the scars, but I am also very grateful to still be alive.’

Cheshire
 Constabulary Detective Inspector Helen Spooner, who led the 
investigation, said: ‘The victim almost died as a result of the actions 
of Floyd Evans. This was an unprovoked and violent attack on a man not 
known to him, which left him fighting for his life.

‘Physically
 the victim has recovered from this ordeal but mentally he is destroyed.
 He will have to live with what happened to him for the rest of his 
life. The experience has been traumatic.’

Chief
 Superintendent Phil Jones, who is in charge of policing in Chester city
 centre, said: ‘Violent crime of any kind is not acceptable and this 
particular case was treated as a hate crime.

‘We
 hope that verdict reassures both the victim and those in the local 
community that hate crime is treated extremely seriously and will not be
 tolerated.’

'I will never forget the incident and will always have the scars, but I am also very grateful to still be alive'

Francisco Nascimento, victim

Richard Riley, Senior Crown Prosecutor with Mersey-Cheshire Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘We have always believed that Floyd Evans stabbed My Nascimento because he thought he was gay and that Evans went to that part of the city walls that night for that very reason.

‘Evans is clearly a violent man, quite possibly harbouring sinister feelings towards certain sections of our community. This was what we describe as a hate crime and the Crown Prosecution Service is determined to bring those responsible to justice.

‘Mr Nascimento had done nothing wrong on the night he was attacked. Evans now has several years in prison ahead of him to reflect on the violence and recklessness of his actions on that night.’
