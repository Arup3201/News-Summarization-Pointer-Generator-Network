Miranda Kerr’s mother Therese has denied a falling out with her supermodel daughter, insisting it is time to follow her own dreams instead of living life vicariously through Miranda.

Responding to claims the pair had a rift following Therese’s decision to quit as chief executive officer of Miranda’s cosmetic brand Kora, the 48-year-old said she had simply decided to step out of Miranda’s shadow.

‘As a mum, I have lived a lot of dreams through Miranda,’ she told the Australian Women's Weekly.

‘There’s no right or wrong in that. But health and wellness is my passion. Now I am going to follow my own dream.'

After leaving Kora, Therese has started to set up her own range of beauty products – a move that many believed was done so the mother and daughter would be business competitors.

But she rejected the claims, saying the two brands were complementary to each other.

‘I would never do anything to compete with her because that’s just not who we are as a family…Miranda was so supportive of me bringing this out,’ she said.

Therese took the reins of Kora in 2010, while Miranda was strutting her stuff on the catwalk as a Victoria’s Secret model.

While she was CEO, the business grew from a small enterprise to a medium-sized one that sells products to 67 countries.

Her new beauty range, which she has called Divine, will supply everyday products, such as hand sanitisers, deodorants and shampoo, and be lower in price to Kora to target a broader market.

The comments come a few weeks after the Kerr family spoke about how much they missed Miranda and her three-year-old son Flynn, who she had with ex-husband Orlando Bloom, on ABC TV program Family Confidential.

During the interview, Miranda’s father admitted he wishes his daughter wasn’t famous and wanted to give their grandson a taste of rural Australian life away from the paparazzi in Manhattan.

But Therese rejected claims the interview was an impassioned plea for her daughter to come home.

‘The show wasn’t intended to be and we believe wasn’t about our darling Randa, who we adore and love with all our hearts. It was about Nan and Pa, my mum, our beautiful family – our roots,' she said.

'In the section where we talk about Randa’s success, we were simply being raw and honest in relation to our lives and to our family, and the impact of that success.'
