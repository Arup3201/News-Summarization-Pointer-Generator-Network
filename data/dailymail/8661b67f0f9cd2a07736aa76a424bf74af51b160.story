The two surviving children of the ex-police inspector who stabbed his wife and a third child to death were discharged from hospital today.

Adam and Kimberley Day were due to spend Christmas day with relatives after their father Toby allegedly stabbed their mother, Samantha, and sister Genevieve, to death, before taking his own life on December 8.

The children had spent two weeks in hospital recovering from serious injuries at the Queen's Medical Centre, Notts.

Day, 37, had been dismissed from the force days before attacking his wife, 38, and children - Kimberley, 15, Adam, 12, and Genevieve - at their home in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.

Detective Chief Superintendent Andy Hough, who is leading a team of officers from Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire investigating the deaths, said: 'Adam and Kimberley came out of hospital on Saturday and are spending Christmas with family.

'We have still not done any formal interviews - that will be post-Christmas. We will wait to see if we can do anything between Christmas and the new year.

'We are building up to it, we would like to do it before the children go back to school.'

Det Chief Supt Hough, head of the East Midlands special operations unit major crime team, said: 'We have an account given voluntarily by Adam and we have had two people who were in the area at the relevant times and they have confirmed what we expected them to say from Adam's account and we are happy with that.

'Medically, Adam and Kimberley are getting a lot stronger. They both suffered very serious injuries.

'I don't think anyone could try to put themselves in the place of the children and what they are feeling at this time.'

He said the children were receiving a lot of support from family and professionals to help them deal with the trauma.

He added: 'We have spoken to people who spoke to Toby or Samantha on the day about where they were on the Thursday, who they spoke to in person and on the phone, to get a picture of their movements and their lifestyle.

'We have a good picture of what happened. We know the who, the where and the when, but we don't know the why. There's only one person could tell us that and he's not around any more.'

The attack followed Dayâ€™s dismissal after a disciplinary hearing for misusing force computers. He is thought to have suspected his wife of having an affair and was looking for information.

It is also alleged that he may have worked on the case of a man who killed his family in similar circumstances earlier this year.

Det Chief Supt Hough said: 'A lot of people are grieving as well as the family, including former colleagues, the people of Melton Mowbray and the neighbourhood where the family lived.

'It is important at this stage for Adam and Kimberley to get settled back into their family and that their longer-term care is identified.

'A lot of thought must be about where their guardianship comes from.

'Their thoughts must be about who will look after them and where they're going to live and, as far as possible, get back to normality in the best way they possibly can.

'They've got to try to get some normality back into their lives, to try to make it the same as it was before, as far as is possible.

'A lot of the support to do that will come from their family.'
