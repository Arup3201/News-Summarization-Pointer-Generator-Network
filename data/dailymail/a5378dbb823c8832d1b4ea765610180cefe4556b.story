The computer failure that has affected millions of NatWest customers for the past week meant one man who was unable to pay for bail had to spend an entire weekend in prison.

Michael Brock, 25, appeared at Canterbury Crown Court on Friday charged with attempted rape, assault by penetration and indecent assault.

He was granted bail on condition a surety, believed to be £25,000, was paid before his release.

But the computer glitch meant the money was not transferred to the courts’ service bank account before closing time on Friday.

A court official also tried to check it had been processed on Saturday but the payment had still not been made.

Brock, from Canterbury, was finally allowed to leave custody on Monday on the bail condition he went to stay at an address in Ramsgate.

In a separate case a defendant at 
Westminster Magistrates' Court was released after a judge used his 
discretion to grant bail despite a similar problem occurring.

A spokesman for HM Courts and Tribunals Service said: “Defendants are released on bail once confirmation of the receipt of bail is received.

'We are aware of only two cases where there was a banking issue. We were advised of one case (at Canterbury) by barristers on Monday morning.

'It related to a case last Friday and court staff used their discretion to ensure that the defendant was released as soon as possible on Monday.

'In the second case (at Westminster 
Magistrates Court) the judge made a judicial decision last Friday to 
release the defendant given the circumstances.'

Elsewhere, customers have been left unable to 
pay bills, do their grocery shopping or make essential transfers since 
Wednesday as a result of IT problems.

Many
people went unpaid as a result of the error but they were able to go to
NatWest branches with proof of employment and given up to £300 to tide 
them over.

It is expected that it will take until
the middle of this week for all the problems to be rectified but for 
many there will be an ongoing issue of having to contact their banks to 
claim back any automatic charges incurred as a result of the problems.

It was revealed last night that the 
flawed computer programme was being supervised by an IT support team in 
India and yesterday Stephen Hester, chief executive of 
RBS, faced calls to forefeit his bonus over the fiasco.

Last
February, RBS advertised for a series of key jobs, paying between 
£9,000 and £11,000 a year, in the Indian city of Hyderabad, much less 
than what an equivalent worker would be paid in Britain.

The banking giant was urgently seeking
computer graduates with several years experience of using  CA-7, the 
programme which the bank uses to run its vast network of transactions 
and accounts.

The job 
advertisement said: 'Looking for candidates having 4-7 years of 
experience in Batch Administration using CA-7 tool. Urgent requirement 
by RBS.'

But last night technology website The Register claimed that this software needed to be updated and this task was overseen from India by staff who are employed to work around the clock to solve any faults.

RBS has been swift to deny that its controversial job out-sourcing programme has been responsible for the fiasco.

It merely says that the 'software error occurred on a UK-based piece of software' but has declined to say where the staff overseeing the software are based.

It is a fact that the vast computer servers are based in Britain. But insiders confirmed last night that many of their support team are based in India.

Since being rescued by the taxpayer RBS has shed about 30,000 jobs, including more than 20,000 UK-based roles, and has outsourced work abroad.

Some of its IT support teams are now said to be based in India, even though the under-fire banking group's headquarters remain in Edinburgh.

The Unite union questioned whether the 'off-shoring' job cuts had left the bank unable to cope after the software failure.

Last night insiders said problems began on Tuesday night when CA-7 was updated. On a normal evening, this should allow all the cashpoint withdrawals, salary transfers and direct debits to be updated.

The nightly update is the reason why internet banking transactions made by so many customers are not updated if they are made after a certain time of the day.

But what appears to have happened is that crucial files were deleted. The error was spotted but – incredibly – was repeated on Wednesday and again on Thursday.

It was only on Friday morning that staff realised the full scale of the crisis. Urgent calls to India followed and troubleshooters were drafted in.

The problem was that every single transaction that was waiting in the queue had to be reprocessed in strict order of arrival, causing further delays over last weekend.

RBS has consistently denied that the decision to relocate jobs to India has made any difference to its handling of the situation.

'Out of touch': Outspoken Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott has said there should be 
'no question' of Stephen Hester, chief executive of NatWest parent RBS, 
receiving a bonus from the state-controlled bank this year

But critics said that if the number of
UK-based support staff had been cut back, it would always run the risk 
of problems if there was a major fault.

Last night Computer Associates, which owns CA-7, declined to comment on what had caused the problem.

The fiasco is believed to be the longest and most widespread problem of its kind since the advent of computer banking.

Which?
said it raised questions about how robust systems were at other banks. 
Britain's major banks have all faced criticism that they are reliant on 
constantly grafting software updates on to their complex computer 
systems rather than replacing the systems themselves.

David
Bannister, the editor of Banking Technology magazine, told Channel 4 
News: 'What should have been a minor glitch has led to a pretty 
disastrous cock-up.'

He questioned why a back-up system did not appear to have been in place to protect the bank against a software failure.

The executive directly responsible for the bank's IT systems is chief administrative officer Ron Teerlink. His pay and bonus are not disclosed because he does not sit on the main board, but he is understood to receive a six-figure package.

Leading Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott accused the back of a 'monumental systematic failure' adding that there was 'no question' of Stephen Hester receiving an annual bonus from the state-owned bank - if he was allowed to keep his job.

As well as his short-term bonus, Hester is also eligible for £7.9million of long term incentive awards over a number of years, provided he meets performance targets.

Mr Hester took home more than £1.2million last year after he agreed to waive a £1.6million bonus following weeks of political pressure.

But he cannot even guarantee that the crisis – which has led to a backlog of 100million transactions – will have been ironed out by the end of the week amid claims from insiders that the ‘priority incident’ is far from being resolved.

Customers called for him to resign and accused RBS and its subsidiaries, NatWest and Ulster Bank, of repeatedly lying about fixing the computer fault which triggered the week of misery for the group’s 16.9million account holders.
