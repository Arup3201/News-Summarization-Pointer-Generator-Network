A photographer has revealed amazing images of the night sky above beautiful vistas on Earth.

In the images, hundreds of stars are seen shooting forwards and streaking across the night sky with short bursts of light.

And elsewhere these stars create incredible swirling patterns, spiralling above a large rock jutting through the calm sea. 

Photographer Maurizio Pignotti has revealed amazing images of the night sky above beautiful vistas on Earth, created by Earth's rotation

The magnificent star trails are created by the Earth's rotation and were captured by Maurizio Pignotti from Civitanova, Italy.

They were taken in various locations including  the Pollino National Park, in the Conero Regional Park, Gargano National Park and the National Park of the Sibillini Mountains in Italy.

From one bright star illuminating an old tree stump, to skies filled with hundreds of small stars, Mr Pignotti said he has a passion for catching magical night skies on camera.

He described each outing as an 'adventure alone', unafraid of difficult conditions and journeying from sea caves to the highlands of Castellucio.

He said: 'My favourite photo is the image of the caves - it was a great adventure, positioned in the caves at night all alone. I was totally immersed in sea water to take only a few clicks.

'You can even see my tent in one of the caves.'

The images were taken in various locations including 6,600 feet (2,000 metres) above the Pollino National Park, in the Conero Regional Park, Gargano National Park and the National Park of the Sibillini Mountains in Italy

And the freelance photographer refuses to use any editing.

Maurizio said: 'These are all photographed using different techniques. The spiral effect was created by the Earth's rotation and a long exposure combined with a zooming machine.

'The star trails all move in different directions because of the sphericity of the sky - I just add some zooming techniques, and then I get this particular effect.'

Mr Pignotti said it takes anywhere from 20 seconds up to three hours to create each image - relying on the natural turning of the globe for a good result

Mr Pignotti travelled to some stunning locations in order to take the time-lapse photography, which involves setting up a camera and taking a long-exposure shot to capture the motion of slow moving objects, in this case stars, in images

Maurizio takes anywhere from 20 seconds up to three hours to create each image - relying on the natural turning of the globe for a good result.

He even managed to capture some familiar star formations, including the star cluster Pleiades - visible in his photo with the tree and the moon in the centre.

The 46-year-old added: 'As a child I had a passion for astronomy, the starry night sky has always fascinated me. I love the charm and mystery of the night in these photos.

'They just reveal the infinity of the cosmos.'

Mr Pignotti said this is his favourite photo. 'It was a great adventure, positioned in the caves at night all alone,' he said. 'I was totally immersed in sea water to take only a few clicks. You can even see my tent in one of the caves'

In this image the beauty of the Milky Way can be seen rising into the night sky. Our solar system sits in one of the arms of the Milky Way and, when we look towards its core, we see a band of light from other stars in our galaxy
