Airlines including British Airways have been accused of purchasing headphones manufactured at a Chinese jail where prisoners were beaten for missing production targets.

A former inmate of China's Dongguan Prison has claimed he made disposable headsets for British Airways, Qantas and Emirates while he was behind bars.

Danny Cancian, who is from New Zealand and was released from Dongguan last year, told the Australian Financial Review prisoners were punished for slow production rates by being 'taken outside and tasered'. British Airways has emphatically denied using prison labour in its supply chain and said all of its suppliers were subject to 'rigorous' checks.

Qantas immediately suspended its sourcing arrangements in the wake of Mr Cancian's allegations in order to carry out an investigation, while Emirates has said it is 'satisfied' there is no evidence of any unethical practices in the headset manufacturing process.

Mr Cancian also told the AFR he made inductors that were used in electrical appliances for local Chinese companies while at Dongguan - including one that supplies home appliance giant Electrolux.

The Kiwi, who spent four years behind bars after a man he kicked during a restaurant brawl died, said it was a 'cruel environment' at the prison, adding: 'You wake up every morning wondering if you are going to survive the day.'

He claimed some prisoners' hands were left 'deformed' by the repetitive nature of producing the intricate inductors, which he said inmates made by winding copper wire around a ceramic cylinder.

Another inmate, who withheld his name, also told the Australian newspaper he had made inductors and headphones for Qantas while serving time at Dongguan.

'We also made them for Emirates, British Airways and lots of others,' he said.

Dongguan City Joystar Electronic Co, which uses prison labour to fulfil large orders, told the AFR it had made 300,000 sets of disposable headphones last year to fill an order for Airphonics - a main supplier of Qantas.

During visits to the prison reporters from the paper also saw trucks leaving Dongguan's factory complex that bore the logo for Dongguan Dazhong Electronic Co, which lists Electrolux and Emerson Electric among its clients.

Qantas has released a statement announcing that it was 'very concerned' by the allegations and that sourcing arrangements had been suspended pending an investigation.

'The allegation that our supplier of economy class headsets, which is in Vietnam, used a third party company in China to help fill an order contradicts the verbal and written assurances we've had from this supplier that their supply chain process met our standards - including the ethical treatment of workers.

'To be clear, Qantas has no relationship with the Chinese-based company at the centre of AFR's claims,' the statement goes on, insisting that the airline conducts regular audits of factories to ensure the strict conditions it places on suppliers are met.

British Airways said its headsets were provided by Linstol, which only uses credited factories when producing the headphones.

'Our supplier has made it abundantly clear that it has never used prisons in China to produce any British Airways headphones,' a spokesman said.'We pride ourselves on providing the very best products for our customers.

'All of our suppliers are subject to a rigorous procurement process prior to appointment and we enforce compliance to a robust Labour Standards Policy throughout the duration of the contract,' it said, adding that Linstol, like all BA suppliers, were required to comply with its ethical code of practice.

A spokesman for Swedish firm Electrolux told MailOnline that Dahzong was an 'indirect supplier', but added that it had carried out an audit and found no evidence to indicate it had sourced any products made using prison labour.

'It is obviously an extremely complicated issue to know exactly what came from where when you go right down the supply chain,' pointing out that the number of indirect suppliers could run to 'hundreds of thousands'.

He added that while the firm's audits had indicated no cause for concern, any evidence of the kind of production methods outlined in the AFR report would be 'completely unacceptable' to Electrolux and against the company's code of practice.

Emirates told the Australian newspaper its headsets were made by an 'industry-leading' company that supplied hundreds of other airlines.

The airline is yet to respond to MailOnline's request for comment.

Emerson, which has said all of its suppliers are expected to comply with the firm's code of conduct, has said it is investigating the matter.

Chinese authorities have made it compulsory for prison inmates to work while they serve their sentences.

Prisoners in Dongguan are paid 8 yuan ($1.40) a month for their work.
