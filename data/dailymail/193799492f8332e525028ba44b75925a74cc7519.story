As firefighters emerge from another wildfire season in the Western U.S. scientists are working on giving them a 21st century tool - a fire-spotting satellite.

U.S. researchers said such a satellite could view the Western U.S. almost continuously, snapping pictures of the ground every few seconds in search of hot spots that could be newly ignited wildfires.

Firefighting resources could then be directed to these spots in hope of preventing the fires from growing out of control and threatening lives and property.

This is an artist's concept of the FUEGO satellite, which would snap digital photos of the Western U.S. every few seconds in search of hot spots that could be newly ignited fires

The scientists, from the University of California, Berkeley, have designed a satellite using state-of-the-art sensors, written analysis software to minimize false alarms and have even given it a name – the Fire Urgency Estimator in Geosynchronous Orbit (FUEGO).

They are hopeful it can be built for several hundred million dollars, either by government or private entities.

'If we had information on the location of fires when they were smaller, then we could take appropriate actions quicker and more easily, including preparing for evacuation,' said fire expert Scott Stephens, a UC Berkeley associate professor of environmental science, policy and management.

'Wildfires would be smaller in scale if you could detect them before they got too big, like less than an acre.'

Professor Stephens, physicist Carl Pennypacker, remote sensing expert Maggi Kelly and their colleagues describe the satellite in an article published by the journal Remote Sensing.

The satellite could help direct firefighting resources to locations to try and prevent fires from growing out of control, like this one in the Sequoia National Forest

Referring to the devastating 1991 fire that destroyed more than 3,000 homes in Berkeley and Oakland, Dr Pennypacker, a research associate at the university's Space Sciences Lab and a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said:  'With a satellite like this, we will have a good chance of seeing something from orbit before it becomes an Oakland fire.

'It could pay for itself in one firefighting season, he added.

Professor Stephens explained that with global warming, wildfires are expected to become more frequent and more extensive.

This year alone, California's firefighting arm, CAL FIRE, has responded to over 6,000 wildfires - 1,600 more than average - according to tweets by the department's information officer Daniel Berlant.

Wildfire-prone areas stretching from Spain to Russia could also benefit from their own dedicated satellites.

Fire detection today is much like it was 200 years ago, Professor Stephens said.

It relies primarily on spotters in fire towers or on the ground and on reports from members of the public, although this information is augmented by aerial reconnaissance and lightning detectors that steer firefighters to ground strikes, which are one of the most common causes of wildfires.

'Even today, most fires are detected, in some way or another, by people,' he said.

But satellite technology, remote sensing and computing have advanced to the stage where it is now possible to orbit a geostationary satellite that can reliably distinguish small, but spreading, wildfires with few false alarms.

Dr Pennypacker estimates that the satellite, which could be built and operated by the federal government, like the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), as a partnership between government and the private sector like the Landsat satellite program, or by a private company alone, would cost several hundred million dollars - a fraction of the nation's $2.5 billion yearly firefighting budget.

The idea of a fire detection satellite has been floated before, but until recently, detectors have been prohibitively expensive and the difficulty of discriminating a small burning area from other bright hotspots, such as sunlight glinting off a mirror or windshield, made the likelihood of false alarms high.

Today, computers are faster, detectors cheaper and more sensitive, and analysis software far more advanced, making false alarms much less likely, according to the researchers.

'Simply put, we believe we have shown that this kind of rapid, sensitive fire detection of areas bigger than 10 feet on a side is probably feasible from space, and we have evidence that the false alarm rate will not be crazy,' said Dr Pennypacker, who has designed sensitive satellite-borne detectors for 40 years.

With global warming, wildfires are expected to become more frequent so wildfire-prone areas stretching from Spain to Russia could benefit from similar satellites, according to the scientists. They said the satellite could pay for itself in one firefighting season. The burned remains of one of the homes on Bonita Vista Road near Lake Hemet, California are pictured

Dr Kelly said: 'In concept, this is a simple system: a telephoto camera, an infrared filter and a recording device.

'We are just looking for something bright compared to the surroundings or changing over time

'Then, we do these rapid calculations to determine if one image is different from the next,' she said.

Dr Pennypacker and graduate student Marek K. Jakubowski developed a computer analysis technique, or algorithm, to detect these differences in space and time and to distinguish them from bright lights that might look like fires.

This involves several billion calculations per second on images taken every few seconds, covering the entire West every few minutes.

The new paper reports on tests of this algorithm using existing imagery from real fires, but the team hopes to get funding to test the system on a fire that is starting, such as a prescribed burn.
