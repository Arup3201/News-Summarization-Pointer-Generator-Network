Drivers and air passengers faced miserable journeys today thanks to a blanket of fog covering roads, railway tracks and airports.

Heathrow was forced to cancel 84 flights, while traffic ground to a halt on major roads after accidents caused by poor visibility.

Traffic was stalled on the M25 following an hour-long closure of three lanes this morning.

Grim start: Commuters at Pettswood station in Bromley, Kent, wait for their train into south-east London on a damp morning

Squinting at the sky: Drivers crawl along the roads, left, while a keen jogger enjoys a bracing run in the mist

Ethereal: The foggy weather looked beautiful this morning against golden leaves and bare branches - but those travelling long distances were less amused

Police
have warned motorists to drive carefully in the foggy conditions and 
having been pulling cars over where they appear to be putting themselves or others in danger.

Two lanes closed on the M60 and the M4 was jammed after car crashes.

Airports across the UK have been 
forced to cancel or divert flights and some planes have been diverted, 
bringing misery to passengers flying in and out of the country.

Here is the run-down of what to expect if you are travelling by air today.

A vehicle fire caused delays on the M6 and the A40 is closed at Barnard Gate, with a broken-down vehicle leading to jams on the A34 at Abingdon and A1 at Biggleswade.

A lane closed between junction 5 and 6 on the M80, at Stretton on Dunsmore on the A45 and at Trerulefoot on the A38.

Around 120 flights into and out of the UK did not take off today, with 30 cancelled at London City Airport, 19 delayed indefinitely and four diverted.

A
spokeswoman for the airport warned passengers to check the airport's website or contact
their airline in case of any further problems.

Norwich airport was also affected by the fog, with some flights diverted to other airports, one cancelled and all flights delayed.

A spokeswoman for the airport told Norwich Evening News that passengers could keep updated with the latest news by checking the online departure and arrivals information on the airport website but added: 'We are checking everything in on time so if your flight is not cancelled you should arrive at the airport on time.

'Hopefully in the next hour or so it should clear up a bit and we have got aircraft on their way.'

Southampton airport reported delays and diversions to flights from the Channel Islands.

Some flights into and out of Southend airport were also cancelled, with others diverted to Stansted.

British Airways - one of the airlines 
hit by the poor visibility today - said: 'We are doing everything we can
to help customers on flights disrupted by the foggy conditions across 
the UK and Europe.

Relaxing: A man walks his dog in Redhouse Park, north Birmingham, as overnight fog envelops the Midlands

Frustrating: Queues stretched down the M6 with angry motorists facing huge delays to their journeys after lane closures

Police warnings: Tricky driving conditions on the A34 in Birmingham, with heavy mist and fog is forecast until at least until lunchtime

Cloudy conditions: Dog walkers wandered through a thick veil of fog over Kenilworth, Warwickshire, this morning

'We have been contacting customers on
affected flights, who have the choice of rebooking or claiming a 
refund, and are advising customers to check ba.com for the latest flight
information.

'We apologise to customers for the inconvenience and thank them for their understanding.'

The poor visibility led to the Woolwich Ferry service in London being suspended.

A spokeswoman for Heathrow said the cancellations would allow the airport to create a slack so other planes can land.

Bad luck: Two motorists driving in the foggy conditions got stuck in water at high tide on The Strood, West Mersea, Essex

Bare legs: A hardy cyclist pedalled through the water wearing little more than long-sleeved top

It was the second day running of flight 
disruptions, following delays and cancellations yesterday due to 
anti-austerity strikes across Europe.

Fog patches formed over England and Wales after a cloudy and misty night, but have lifted throughout the day, with patches remaining only in East Anglia.

After a dry start, outbreaks of rain developed across the UK throughout the day, particularly in Northern Ireland and Scotland.

Two motorists got stuck in flooding at high tide on The Strood, West Mersea, Essex.

Essex Police, Essex Fire & Rescue Service and MCA Coastguard mounted a difficult rescue in the fog.

A
spokesman for the Met Office said: 'The fog gathered overnight, mainly 
in East Anglia and into the Midlands, and there is low cloud elsewhere, 
so it will be a murky day.

Tricky to negotiate: Police were today manning dangerous areas and pulling over any cars who were not driving safely

Dog's life: The animals look unfazed by the severe weather conditions

Serious: Emergency services work to help drivers in trouble as a tailback begins behind the incident

Nightmare: The arrivals board in Terminal 5 of Heathrow shows disrupted travel for the day, while the Met Office issued a severe weather warning for the South-East, East Anglia and the Midlands (in yellow)

'The fog will clear throughout day, but slower in some areas, with patchy fog remaining tonight, but nothing as bad as today.

'Going into the weekend, Saturday will be fairly cloudy and wet in England and Wales, with some bright spells, while Scotland will be brighter with scattered showers.

'Sunday will be bright, clear and dry in most places so we'd advise people to make the most of it as next week is looking unsettled - especially Monday, which will be wet and windy.

'Temperatures will be between 8 and 11C.'
