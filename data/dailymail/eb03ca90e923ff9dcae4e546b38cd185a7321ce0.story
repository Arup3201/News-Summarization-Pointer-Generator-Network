British troops spending the festive period in Afghanistan have donned their Christmas gear and got into the swing of things by filming a seasonal video.

The soldiers can be seen wearing Santa beards, dancing and miming along to the classic hit Merry Christmas Everyone.

Members of several regiments and groups based in Camp Bastion and Lashkar Gah took part in the video featuring the Shakin' Stevens song.

Merry Christmas: Troops in Afghanistan get into the festive mood with their seasonal video

Classic hit: Soldiers mime along to the Christmas song Merry Christmas Everyone during the video

Morale: The troops are clearly not letting anything get them down as they enjoy filming the video

The video was filmed with BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James, who has been presenting his drivetime show from the war-torn country each day this week.

Among those taking part in the video were members of RAF Brize Norton, the 21 Engineer Regiment and Lashkar Gah main operating base staff during their 'Lash Got Talent' event.

The troops are clearly enjoying themselves as they sing along to the song, dancing around with each other and even on a few occasions sneaking a quick peck on the cheek under the mistletoe.

DJ Greg teamed up with British Forces Broadcasting Service Radio to simulcast his show from the Camp Bastion base in Helmand Province, broadcasting live from the studio on the ground in Afghanistan.

Elsewhere the video features members of the RAF fire crew in Camp Bastion, the Theatre Logistic Group, Role 3 hospital staff and members of the Engineer Drive Team.

The Radio 1 DJ has been totally immersed in the military environment during his time with the troops, while he regularly reported back to listeners on his show and through his blog.
