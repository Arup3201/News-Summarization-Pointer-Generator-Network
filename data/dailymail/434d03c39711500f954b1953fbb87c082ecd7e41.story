Thousands of teachers have voted to go on strike over the 'erosion' of their pay and working conditions, it was announced today.

The National Union of Teachers (NUT) said its ballot of members had shown that 82.5 per cent were in favour of walkouts, with a turnout of 27 per cent.

Members also voted for industrial action short of strikes, with 91.6 per cent in favour, the union said.

The result raises the threat of huge disruption to schools later this term.

Threat: Thousands of teachers have voted to strike, unions revealed today

NUT general secretary Christine Blower said: 'The NUT is left with no 
option but to take action to protect the well-being of our members and 
restore their rights to do their job thoroughly and properly.

'Teachers are being undermined by a Government whose almost daily 
criticisms and erosion of working conditions and pay, coming on top of 
previous attacks on pensions, are unacceptable. This negative approach 
to the profession has to stop.

'No other profession comes under such continual scrutiny and no other 
profession has accountability systems based on so little trust. This is 
bound to lower morale. It is time for Government to stop dictating to 
teachers and address the problems which they are creating. It is time to
listen to the profession.'

Anger: Michael Gove's Education department has said that the strike would be dangerous

The NUT, which has previously balloted members over changes to public sector pensions, has warned of joint strikes with the NASUWT teachers’ union

The NASUWT already has a mandate to take industrial action over the same issues.

Today, the NUT said the two unions will be campaigning together to 'ensure that the onslaught of attacks on the teaching profession stops'.

Further details of the campaign will be set out on Monday.

Some 228,831 NUT members in state schools, academies and sixth-form colleges in England and Wales were balloted in total.

The ballot result follows a warning by the leader of the UK’s biggest trade union of a fresh wave of co-ordinated strikes because of continuing anger over cuts to pay and pensions which was leading the country on a 'path to poverty'.

Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said there was a 'real likelihood' of more industrial action before the end of the year, following last November’s huge walkout by public sector workers over the Government’s controversial pension reforms.

The pensions issue remains a 'festering sore' among workers in the health service, education and civil service and could erupt again in the coming months, he said.

The annual TUC Congress is being held next week in Brighton, when activists are expected to press for industrial action.

Mr McCluskey said public sector workers had endured a three-year pay freeze and face another two years without any increase, leading to growing numbers of low-paid people having to rely on food banks.

'That is scandalous. The attacks on public sector workers are unfair, and our members remain furious and angry. There is a real chance of coordinated industrial action, if not this winter, then early next year.

'There is a view that strikes are a waste of time, but I reject that. When people feel something is wrong, we have to protest. What else are we supposed to do? Shrug our shoulders and say taking action is not going to make any difference?

When enough people march or take strike action, it has an impact.'

Disruptive: There would be an impact on pupils all over the country if the strike goes ahead

NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: 'Congratulations to the NUT on a positive ballot result.

'This result is the reflection of two years of sustained assault from the Government which has been deeply damaging to teacher morale, as well as to recruitment and retention.

'On Monday the NASUWT will be setting out jointly with the NUT the next steps to defend teachers from attacks on their pay, pensions, workload, working conditions and jobs.'

The Government has today called the threat of strikes damaging.

'We are very disappointed that a small minority of NUT members has voted this way. Industrial action would disrupt pupils' education, hugely inconvenience parents and will damage the profession's reputation in the eyes of the public,' a spokeswoman said.

'Parents and members of the public will struggle to understand why the NUT chose to ballot their members now about pay and working conditions when decisions about future pay arrangements have yet to be made.'
