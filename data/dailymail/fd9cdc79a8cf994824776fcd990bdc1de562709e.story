A mother has spoken of her grief after discovering the baby son she aborted on medical grounds was actually a girl.

Lilias McConville, 49, named the baby Henry, after her husband, and spent years mourning the loss of the son that she aborted in 1992 when doctors said he had Spina Bifida.

The mother-of-four said since learning the truth, she has struggled to come to terms with the fact that she should have been mourning the death of a daughter.

Lilias McConville is suing NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde for £15,000 after she was told the baby she aborted on medical grounds and named Henry was actually a girl

She claims she was misled about the gender of the baby and is now suing NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde for £15,000, which is being contested by the trust.

Mrs McConville said: 'It's not about money. My wee lassie has walked in darkness. I just want closure.

'I can't get on with my life.'

Mrs McConville,  of Knightswood, Glasgow, said she only discovered the baby's true gender in 2001 after she contacted the hospital in light of the Alder Hey Children's Hospital organ scandal.

When the hospital sent the baby's post mortem, which revealed it to be a girl, Mrs McConville said she 'almost collapsed'.

The court papers say she was 'distraught'
and that she had spent 'approximately nine years grieving and 
remembering a son whom she named after her husband'.

She says she suffers from an adjustment disorder, as well as anxiety and depression.

Mrs McConville had the abortion when she was four months pregnant at Queen Mother's Hospital, in Glasgow, when doctors discovered her unborn child had Spina Bifida

She claims she has suffered from loss, injury and damage as a result of the alleged misinformation.

Mrs McConville and her family say they mourned 
Henry by visiting a memorial at Glasgow’s Queen Mother’s Maternity 
Hospital and dedicating a poem to him.

The mother-of-four had the termination in August 1992 - four months into her pregnancy - after being told her 
unborn child had Spina Bifida - a problem with the development of the 
spine.

Papers lodged at Glasgow Sheriff Court state the mother was 'extremely distressed' on admission to the Queen Mother hospital.

The document reads: 'Her baby was delivered at 7.35pm. Mrs McConville thereafter was recorded as being very quiet and subdued.'

She claims that an hour later, when the doctor checked on her, she was told the baby was a boy.

The court papers said: 'After she became aware of the sex of the foetus, Mrs McConville decided she would like to name the baby Henry.'

She claims that weeks after the operation and post mortem she met with medics and that she was not told then about the sex of the baby.

A poem was written for her baby and it along with a card in the name of 'Henry' was put in the Book of Remembrance at the hospital.

It is said Mrs McConville visited the hospital every year with her family to 'remember the son that they lost'.

The 49-year-old claims that Yorkhill Trust, which became part of the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, is liable for their staff including the doctor who she alleges told her the wrong gender.

In the paperwork the hospital says it is 'believed to be true that Mrs McConville was not advised by the Trust that the foetus had been determined to be female'.

Evidence is due to be heard a hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court next month.
