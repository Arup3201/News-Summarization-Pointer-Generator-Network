A family of swallows are ready to fly the nest after four chicks were raised in the roof of a Land Rover.

The nest was found in the vehicle which is used to give visitors tours of Pensthorpe Nature Reserve in Norfolk.

Warden Darren Williams, 45, said he 'felt like a dad again' as he carefully monitored the new-borns' progress while going about his daily job.

He added: 'Our first concern was the welfare of visitors but we also didn't want the birds to come to any harm.

'It was a worry that one of the chicks might fall out as we drove around.

'Ultimately they'll nest wherever they want to nest and there's nothing we can do about it.

'Swallows do have predators on the reserve so I suppose they just thought it was a safe environment.

'The birds seemed very happy and, as we returned from tours, you could almost set your watch by the parents returning with a mouthful of food to feed their chicks.'

A special swallow hammock, crafted from netting, was rigged up to catch the chicks in case they fell out as the Land Rover bounced around the reserve's rough terrain.

The chicks recently fledged and now follow the vehicle around the reserve.

'You can never entirely predict migration behaviour,' Mr Williams said.

'But it is possible the parents and maybe even their offspring will return next year looking for their favourite Land Rover.'
