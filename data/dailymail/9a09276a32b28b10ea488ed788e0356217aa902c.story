Sharon Kerwin always hoped she'd have a little girl to make her family complete - and her dream came true when her daughter Rebecca was born.

But at the age of 10, Rebecca started acting and dressing as a boy and by 16, she revealed she was transgender and changed her name to Blake.

Sharon, from Wigan, accepted her son's decision yet the pair were beset by bullying and abuse that led Blake, now 17, to self harm and even attempt suicide.

Blake and his supportive mother Sharon appeared on ITV's This Morning to talk about his journey 

Sharon noticed her daughter was different at the age of six, when she became fascinated by her brother's toys and games.  

She said: 'it started quite young, playing with boy's toys and [being] interested in boys stuff. He used to copy his brother all the time, taking his stuff and following and copying everything he used to do.'

As well as emulating his brother, as Rebecca, Blake also flew into uncontrollable rages.

These fits became so bad and so frequent Sharon even took him to the doctor to seek advice.

'We thought it was ADHD at first and he was tested and they couldn't find anything. nothing at all was wrong.'

Blake explains that he couldn't put his finger on what he was feeling for years.

He said: 'I knew when I was very young that something wasn't right. I used to have these tantrums and be exploding all the time.

Both Blake and Sharon received abuse over his decision to live as a man with his mother's complete support

'I came out as bisexual at 12 but I wasn't, I just thought I would be more accepted.'

Sharon decided to be entirely accepting of what her then daughter was telling her, but suspected there was something more underneath it.

Blake is is using his experience to help others struggling with gender identity issues

'It was very important that I listened and understood what was making him unhappy.

'I just went along with it. I wanted to see Blake happy instead of so stressed over his gender at the time.

'I had an idea there was something more but I didn't want to question him too much. 

'I had a conversation with someone who was gay and they said not to push him, just to wait until Blake told me in his own time.'

Sharon's intuition turned out to be right and Blake eventually realised that he was not bisexual, but transgender.

At the age of 16, Blake came out to his mother as transgender and formally changed his name by deed poll.

While Sharon accepted Blake at every step of his journey, others were not so understanding and both Blake and Sharon suffered at the hands of bullies.

Some people accused Sharon of somehow encouraging Blake and the abuse became so bad at one point that he began self-harming and he even attempted suicide.

But his transformation into a male body has, Blake says, helped him move on from these dark times and he now feels hopeful about his future.

He said: 'I'm actually progressing more because of the transitioning. It's hurrying along so I've got more hope in myself.'

While the support he's had from his mother and grandmother has been 'brilliant'.

For her part, Sharon says she doesn't miss  having a daughter.

'I don't miss it at all. He is still Blake and I am so so proud of him and the way that he has come out.

Blake will begin taking hormones soon but will have to wait until he turns 18 before beginning his full physical transformation.

He now is using his experience to help others struggling with gender identity issues through a transgender support group.
