Chris Hughton fears he will have to drop down to the Championship to get back into management.

And the former Norwich manager has called for the Football Association to take action in order to halt the problem of the 'massive void' of black and minority ethnic bosses in football.

After Hughton was sacked by Norwich there were no longer any black or minority ethnic managers in the top five tiers of English football.

Short of offers, the former Newcastle and Birmingham manager admits he may well have to take a drop down to the Championship to get back into football.

'I want to manage at the highest level possible,' Hughton said. 'But possible only means the opportunities that you have.

'I hope those opportunities are at a very good level. All of my work has either been at the Premier League or at Championship level.

Waiting game: Hughton says he may have to drop down a level to get back into football

'There are very good clubs when you go through the Championship, a lot of big strong clubs there.

'I would like to go at the highest level possible, but that's not up to me, that's up to someone else.'

Speaking about the lack of opportunities for black and ethnic minority managers, he added: 'I think it drives home that we all have a responsibility in the game.

'Not just the players, not just the clubs, but the authorities and the FA. We all have a responsibility in the game to change that.'
