Popular: The nation spends £6.3billion on takeaway hot drinks every year

It’s that little luxury to which we treat ourselves each working day.

But all those cappuccinos and lattes add up – to no less than £393 a year, a study has revealed.

Over the course of a lifetime, the average consumer will spend £15,725 on takeaway hot drinks.

And for the one in ten who need that extra hit of caffeine, the figure is nearer to £30,000.

The daily takeaway brew is so vital to many people’s routine that it’s considered a ‘non-negotiable’ treat.

However, it seems that the age of austerity is having an effect – 70 per cent of the 2,000 people surveyed claimed that they would try to cut back on their purchases of coffee this year.

Some 70 per cent said they would cut down on their coffee intake by simply buying less, while 56 per cent said they would buy smaller drinks.

Another factor is the growing popularity of home coffee machines: 22 per cent said that they prefer to make their own cappuccinos and lattes – up from 40 per cent five years ago.

Altogether Britain spend £6.3billion on takeaway hot drinks every year, 
according to the research by OrSaveIt, a money-saving phone app.

Alain Desmier, managing director of 
OrSaveIt, said: ‘Millions have made a habit of spending a couple of 
pounds a day on coffee, but it soon adds up.

‘Over
the course of the year, drinking coffee from the office rather than 
buying it in a shop could add up to the cost of a holiday.’

However, another appliance may be gradually dying out.

Demand for kettles dropped by a 
massive seven per cent in the past five years, from 8.1 million sold in 
2007 to 7.5 million in 2012.

In 2008 nearly 15 per cent or one in seven people bought a new kettle, but by last year that figure had dipped to 12.8 per cent.

Overall ownership of kettles has declined from 83 per cent of the population in 2008 to 78 per cent in 2012.

On the way out: The kettle is no longer in demand as it faces stiff competition from coffee machines

The electric kettle was invented by Russell Hobbs in 1956, but became popular in homes from the early 1960s onwards.

Other
small kitchen appliances falling out of fashion include smoothie makers
and juicers, George Foreman-style health grills and deep fat fryers.

Ownership of kettles has fallen from 
83 per cent of the population in 2008 to 78 per cent last year, say 
analysts Mintel. Instead people use coffee machines, one-cup hot water 
dispensers and even heating water in microwave ovens.
