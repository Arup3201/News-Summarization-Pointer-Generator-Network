Coronation Street star Barbara Knox has been arrested on suspicion of drink driving in Cheshire, it has been reported

Veteran Coronation Street star Barbara Knox has been arrested for drink driving, it has been reported.

The 80-year-old, who plays Rita Tanner in the soap, was said to have been arrested after allegedly jumping in her car to remonstrate with police following the arrest of her daughter Maxine Ashcroft for the same offence.

The alleged incident, according to The Sun, began when police pulled over and breathalysed 56-year-old Mrs Ashcroft as she drove her mother home following an afternoon out in Cheshire.

But Knox, who has starred in the series for more than 40 years, later allegedly drove to Knutsford Police Station to demand her release. According to reports, Knox was then arrested.

She has now believed to have been bailed until next month pending inquiries.

The soap star was being driven home from Knutsford by her daughter when police allegedly stopped them.

Ashscroft was breathalysed and was later found to be almost three times the legal limit.

But as officers were questioning her, Knox is said to have arrived at the station and demanded to speak to officers about her daughter.

A source told The Sun: ‘Barbara wasn’t happy her daughter had been arrested.’

A Cheshire Police spokesman said: ‘At 6.41pm on Monday 10 March 2014 police stopped a car in Hollow Lane in Knutsford. A 56-year-old woman from Gloucestershire was arrested on suspicion of drink driving.

'An 80-year-old woman from Knutsford later arrived at Knutsford Police Station and was also arrested on suspicion of drink driving. She was bailed pending further enquiries.

'The 56-year-old woman was charged with driving when the alcohol level was above the limit and bailed to appear at Macclesfield Magistrates on 2 April 2014.'Police stopped a car in Hollow Lane in Knutsford.’

A
 Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said Ashcroft was charged with 
driving a motor vehicle on a road ‘after consuming so much alcohol the 
proportion of it in your breath, namely 97 milligrammes of alcohol in 
100 millilitres of breath, exceeded the prescribed limit’.

The legal limit for drivers is 35 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millitres of breath.

Oldham-born Knox has played Rita in the soap since 1972.

As a long-standing resident of the famous street, she was the former owner of the newsagents The Kabin.

She has seen plenty of success in the role, including winning the TV Times award for best television actress in 1989.

She was also awarded a Lifetime Achievement award at the British Soap Awards in 2004 – one of only six Coronation Street actors to do so.

In 2010, she was made awarded an MBE in the 2010 Queen’s Birthday Honours List for her services to drama.

A spokesman for Coronation Street told the Mail: ‘This is a personal matter.’

Mrs Knox is only the latest Coronation Street star to face legal action - actors Bill Roache and Michael Le Vell were both cleared of sex abuse following high-profile court cases, while two more stars were involved in a child sex investigation which was dropped last month.

In addition, Chris Fountain was sacked from the soap last week after making an expletive-filled rap video in which he threatened to rape a woman.

She made her first appearance on Coronation Street in 1964, playing Rita Bates in just a single episode, before taking up the role permanently in May 1972.

The character was originally known as Rita Littlewood, but later took the surnames Bates, Fairclough, Sullivan and Tanner as she went through a series of husbands.

Rita was the owner of the Kabin, the local corner shop, and has been through a series of dramatic incidents including a nervous breakdown, carbon monoxide poisoning and a building explosion.

Mrs Knox, 80, was previously said to be the highest paid member of the soap's cast, on a contract reported to be worth £260,000 a year.

She has twice been married and divorced, and is the mother of three children. She was awarded the OBE in 2010
