Tragic: The family of Rosa Esparza, 52, (pictured) is suing Six Flags Over Texas for negligence after the mother of two fell to her death from the ride in July

A Texas amusement park this weekend reopened the roller coaster from which a 52-year-old woman fell to her death as her family sues the company for negligence.

Dallas' Rosa Esparza died
after plummeting from the Texas Giant ride while it was upside down and hitting a metal support beam at Six Flags Over 
Texas on July 19.

Six Flags announced last week that the notorious 153-foot tall roller coaster will reopen this weekend with new seat belts and redesigned restraint bar pads following an internal investigation.

While the company maintains a 
mechanical failure was not to blame for Esparza's tragic fall, her family have 
accused the park of negligence and operating a faulty ride.

The $1 million lawsuit, filed yesterday, names Six Flags 
Entertainment Corporation, Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc, Texas Flags, Ltd.
and Six Flags Over Texas as defendants.

According to the suit, Esparza, who 
also went by the surname Ayala-Gaona, was in the front left 
seat of the train’s second car behind her daughter and son-in-law.

The 
car had no seat belt or shoulder harness, only a single lap or 'T-bar'
to restrain passengers, Star-Telegram reported.

'As the roller-coaster was in its first 
large descent, Rosa Esparza’s daughter heard screaming and yelling 
behind her, and turned to see her mother in the process of being thrown 
out of the car, out from behind the safety in her seat,' the suit 
states.

Reopening: The Texas Giant roller coaster ride in Six Flags Over Texas, which was shut down after a 52-year-old ride plunged to her death, will start operating again this weekend after engineers have given it the all-clear

Would you ride Six Flags' Texas roller coaster that woman fell to her death from?

Esparza was then thrown against a support piling as the car twisted and turned, landing on the tunnel's roof.

'She was then catapulted many feet below
onto the metal roof of a tunnel,' the lawsuit states.

Before the mother of two fell about 
75 feet, witnesses said she had complained her harness wasn't fastened securely.

'They didn't secure her right. One of the employees from the park — one of the ladies — she asked her to click her more than once, and they were like, 'As long you heard it click, you're OK.' Everybody else is like, 'Click, click, click.' ' a witness told The Dallas News.

'Hers only clicked once. Hers was the only one that went down once, and she didn't feel safe, but they let her still get on the ride.'

Ominous: Witnesses said they heard Rosa Esparza complain about her harness before she fell

The suit states Esparza's daughter and son-in-law were forced
to complete the ride for 'what seemed like an interminable time knowing
that Rosa Esparza had been thrown out of the ride and not knowing 
whether she was dead or seriously injured and in need of immediate 
medical attention'.

It also claimed Six Flags employees initially refused to believe that Esparza had been thrown off the ride.

'It’s a tragedy of the highest order,' Dallas attorney Frank Branson, who filed the suit in 
Tarrant County yesterday on the family’s behalf, told Star-Telegram.

'I believe it should have been 
avoided and could have been avoided.'

Following a nearly two-month investigation by the 'ride train manufacturer, internal engineers and external experts', the Texas Department of Insurance has given the park approval to start up the ride again.

Six Flags officials said it has now added 'incremental and overlapping safety measures' to the ride, including re-designed 
restraint-bar pads from the manufacturer and new seat belts.

The park will also now provide a coaster ride seat at the entrance to allow guests 
with 'unique body shapes and sizes' to see if they fit in the restraint.

'We are heartbroken and will forever 
feel the pain and sadness of this tragic accident,' Steve 
Martindale, president of Six Flags Over Texas, said.

'The safety of our guests
and employees is our company’s absolute highest priority and we try to 
take every reasonable precaution to eliminate the risk of accidents.'

Martindale said he and his family would 
be among the first riders this weekend.

Devastating: Esparza's family is suing Six Flags Over Texas for negligence after the tragic accident

The Esparza family’s suit says Six Flags
operators have known for decades the extreme dangers posed by
such rides.

This
is the park’s second fatality. In 1999, a 28-year-old Arkansas woman 
died and 10 others were injured when a boat capsized on the Roaring 
Rapids ride.

In 2006, 
nine park patrons were injured on the Texas Tornado when one of the 
mechanical bearings that spins the ride malfunctioned.

'More often than not, the response of 
the Six Flags defendants to roller-coaster tragedies at their parks has 
been merely to feign surprise and to belatedly add safety belts in an 
attempt to calm the public’s fears,' the lawsuit states.

Star-Telegram also reports the suit states that inspections done on
the roller coasters since Esparza’s death 'showed that various parts of
the security systems on the ride were experiencing inconsistencies and 
intermittent failures.'

'In addition, Six Flags has now admitted
that, after these inspections, they replaced a ‘limit switch’ for a 
restraint in the very car in which Rosa was riding because Six Flags 
found the switch to be defective,' the suit states.

The Texas Giant, which rises 14 stories 
high and has a 79-degree first drop (the steepest in the world for a 
wooden roller coaster), had been closed since Esparza’s death.

The roller coaster 
debuted as an all-wooden ride in 1990, and reopened in 2011 redesigned 
with a steel track during the theme park's 50th anniversary. The ride's 
tallest height is 153 feet and has a drop of 147 feet.
