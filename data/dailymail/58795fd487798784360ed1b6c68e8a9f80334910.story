Wesley Sneijder insists Holland can still win their Euro 2016 qualifier against Turkey without Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie.

Robben was left with a torn stomach muscle during Bayern Munich's shock 2-0 defeat by Borussia Monchengladbach, while Manchester United's Van Persie has been out with an ankle injury.

'We can also get a good result without Arjen and Robin,' Sneijder told De Telegraaf. 'Although you don't need a degree in maths to know that their absence is a bit of a blow.

Robben was forced off and will not be able to feature for Holland in their Euro 2016 qualifier with Turkey

'Arjen and Robin show week after week that they are among the best players in the world at Bayern Munich and Manchester United, respectively.

'So they will obviously be missed. Just like the absence of Ron Vlaar is a blow for us. But I have been in situations like this before, so I know it does not help to think about it too much. We will do everything within our power to beat Turkey.

'I don't feel any extra pressure because of their absence, but there is some added responsibility. It will now be up to Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Nigel de Jong and myself to support the younger players.'

Holland sit third in Group A with six points from four games, while Turkey sit fourth with four points.Â
