As one of the world's most in-demand models, looking good is the key to Jourdan Dunn's career, but it seems her glamorous job is taking its toll on her hair.

The 24-year-old revealed that she's taken to wearing wigs to give her natural locks a break from styling because her tresses were becoming so damaged, they started falling out at the front.

Speaking to HELLO! magazine, she said: 'My hair has been so damaged with heat and styling because most hairdressers still don't know what to do with Afro hair.'

Jourdan Dunn is one of the most esteemed supermodels in the world but it seems the fashion industry has been taking its toll on her hair, which she reveals became so damaged, that it started falling out

Jourdan revealed that last year, her hair stylist, Renda Attia, insisted that she needed to give her hair a break and start wearing wigs.

She continued: 'I mean, I had no hair around my hairline - it was like baby hair, it was so damaged. So I've been wearing wigs and having them changed every month, having lots of conditioning treatments and, finally, my hair is growing back.

Charlotte Mensah, current British Hairdressing Awards, Afro Hairdresser of the Year and owner of award-winning salon Hair Lounge (charlottemensah.com) shared her top tips for not over-processing Afro hair with FEMAIL.

She said: 'If you’re experiencing hair damage and loss, the only option to minimise this is to begin a strict weekly regime of deep conditioning treatments.'

She also recommends following a balanced diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables that provide the body with the natural and necessary vitamins and minerals that are the basis for healthy skin and hair. 

'You need to balance the topical products you are using with a healthy lifestyle including the right foods, 6-8 glasses of water a day and enough sleep to help from the inside out as well,' she said.

Avoiding products heavy in mineral oils, which block pores, is essential, as is gentle combing and regular trims.

FEMAIL caught up with the Maybelline New York ambassadress recently and we discovered that an exhaustive eight-step beauty regime that takes her nearly an hour a day is behind her flawless supermodel skin.

Sharing her 'hardcore' beauty regime, Jourdan told us: 'I visited Tokyo and became obsessed with their skincare, which is very advanced. Their regimes have loads more steps but I incorporated some of their techniques into mine and developed my own eight step regime. 

'It takes me a good twenty minutes in the morning and then about half an hour in the evening.'

The secret behind her flawless skin? An eight step skincare regime and lip balm as eyeshadow and cheek tint

Jourdan, who is currently the face of Burberry, has picked up some quirky beauty tips during her time in the industry.

Her favourites? 'Hold a credit card behind your lashes when you apply your mascara. If you press against the card you get a wide-eyed, curled effect without getting lots of product on your eyelid,' she advised.

She also swears by using lip balm as an eyeshadow to give a 'glossy' finish (her favourite is Maybelline Baby Lips Lip Balm), and she often uses the pink tinted ones as blusher. 

When it comes to beauty, 24-year-old Jourdan, an accomplished cook who runs her own cookery YouTube channel, believes it's all about what you put in.

'I like to eat healthy,' she said. 'I love good greens and fish and I'm not really a snacker. 

'Luckily the backstage catering at fashion week has improved. There used to be nothing or just really boring food but they've really stepped it up. Diane Von Furstenberg even had an amazing gluten-free buffet backstage at her show.'  

As a  Vogue regular, who was scouted in Primark in her teens, Jourdan was on the road to success very early in her career.

She's clocked up campaigns for Balmain, DKNY, Victoria's Secret and Topshop and walked in the Olympics closing ceremony alongside Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss. 

When she's not on the catwalk, Jourdan is a proud mother to her son Riley, who was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia.

This has led to Jourdan’s active involvement as the Parent Ambassador for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America and the future is looking bright for the young starlet.

She explained: 'I am collaborating on a sunglasses range and designing my own kidswear line. My son is really involved and has been helping me choose the colours and designs.'

Charlotte Mensah, current British Hairdressing Awards, Afro Hairdresser of the Year and owner of award-winning salon Hair Lounge (charlottemensah.com) gives her top tips for not over-processing Afro hair:

Weekly Conditioning

If you’re experiencing hair damage and loss, the only option to minimise this is to begin a strict weekly regime of deep conditioning treatments such as the MIZANI Fiberfyl in-salon Strengthening Treatment, which contains filloxane technology to instantly penetrate the hair fibre, filling into weak areas, giving stronger, fuller results.

Supplement Haircare with Diet

I’d also recommend following a balanced diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables that provide the body with the natural and necessary vitamins and minerals that are the basis for healthy skin and hair. You need to balance the topical products you are using with a healthy lifestyle including the right foods, 6-8 glasses of water a day and enough sleep to help from the inside out as well.

Use Natural Oils

Avoid products that are heavy in mineral oil as this can block the pores. There are natural oils that do the same job and yield great results. You can massage natural oils into the hairline where breakage is happening to stimulate the blood circulation in these areas and promote regrowth.

Let Hair Breathe

While it’s understandable why women may want to wear a wig to cover up hair loss or breakage, I’d highly recommend taking it off when indoors and overnight to allow the scalp to breathe.

Colouring Afro Hair

Colouring any hair type can be damaging to condition, however ammonia-free formulas like L’Oréal Professionnel INOA are much gentler on the hair. These formulas also tend to amplify shine, which gives the appearance of healthier hair.

Gentle Combing

When your hair is weaker or suffering from breakage, make sure you choose combs that have wide teeth and no seams, which can snag the hair. Kent Handmade Combs, which are made from a single sheet of cellulose acetate, a non-petroleum based plastic derived from plants that has been found to create less static in the hair. They are then hand polished and buffed to create soft, rounded teeth that will not damaged the hair or scalp. Due to the way the teeth are cut rather than moulded, they are much less likely to snag causing split ends, but instead stimulate the natural oils inside the hair cuticle encouraging each strand to lie flat, creating healthy, strong and shiny hair.

Regular Trims

Ensure you are coupling your deep condition treatments with regular trims every 6-8 weeks to encourage healthy hair. While hair loss often happens around the hairline, a lot of damage occurs through the mid-lengths and ends, so ensuring they are in the best condition will give the illusion of an all-over healthier, fuller head of hair.
