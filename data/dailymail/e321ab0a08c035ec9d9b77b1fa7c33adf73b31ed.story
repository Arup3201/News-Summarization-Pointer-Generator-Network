NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell failed to attend the 49ers season opener on Sunday, as pressure mounted for him to resign following the Ray Rice domestic violence scandal

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell dodged an appearance at a 49ers game on Sunday as pressure mounted on him to resign in the wake of the Ray Rice domestic violence scandal.

Goodell, who has been under intense pressure since a video appeared showing Rice punching his then-fiancee unconscious, had agreed to watch the San Francisco team's season opener at the newly constructed Levi's Stadium.

He had indicated he would attend as early as April 2012, when construction of the stadium first began.

The president of the 49ers, Paraag Marathe, had earlier said he had expected Goodell at the game, according to the Huffington Post. 

The no-show capped off a week which American media dubbed the 'worst week in the history of the NFL'.

It follows a video released by TMZ on September 8 showing Rice punching Janay Palmer in an elevator in Atlantic City.

The Baltimore Ravens player was later released by his team and indefinitely suspended by the NFL - a punishment that was criticised for being too lenient and too late.

Goodell claimed he hadn't seen the most graphic portion of the video. An earlier version of the footage had been given to NFL bosses months before.

After an initial version of the video was released in February, Rice was given a two-game suspension, which led to calls for Goodell to resign.

The NFL has a history of imposing only minor punishments on players accused of domestic violence.

Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, this week said the only 'workable solution' was for Goodell to resign.

He told the Boston Globe that the league needed new leadership to change the 'culture of violence against women that pervades the NFL'.

In another incident over the weekend, Minnesota Vikings player, Adrian Peterson, appeared in court accused of striking his four-year-old son 10-15 times with a tree branch.

The 29-year-old was freed on bail, on a charge of causing injury to a child, after turning himself in to Texas police after a warrant was issued for his arrest.

His son suffered injuries to his back, hands, buttocks, ankles, legs and scrotum.

And in a third incident, Carolina Panthers' player Greg Hardy, is awaiting trial on charges of assault on a female and communicating threats. 

Authorities said he had chocked his then-girlfriend, threw her around, dragged her by her hair and had threatened to kill her.

Hardy was found guilty by a judge in July and was sentenced to 18 months of probation and was given a 60-day suspended sentence.

He then appealed the verdict and is now set to appear before a jury in November.
