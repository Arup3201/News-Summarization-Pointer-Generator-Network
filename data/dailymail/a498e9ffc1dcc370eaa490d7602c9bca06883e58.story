A Pennsylvania police chief’s daughter and two men involved in a brutal attack on a gay couple which captured national attention will stand trial, a judge ruled Tuesday.

Kathryn Knott, the 24-year-old daughter of Chalfont Police Chief Karl Knott, Philip Williams, 24, and Kevin Harrigan, 26, face felony assault and conspiracy charges with a maximum penalty of 30 years in jail. 

The trio were involved in a late-night brawl on September 11 in the streets of Philadelphia which left Zachary Hesse, 28, 'terrified' and his boyfriend, Andy Haught, with a broken jaw and cheekbones.

Trial date set: Philip Williams, left, Kathryn Knott and Kevin Harrigan face felony assault and conspiracy charges with a maximum penalty of 30 years in jail following a street brawl with a gay couple 

According to testimony by Hesse, 28,  the confrontation began around 10:45pm. 

He and his partner had left a frozen-yogurt shop and were walking to get pizza in the city's Gayborhood when they came across eight to ten young adults out on the town.

One of the revelers allegedly asked if they were gay, using profanity and slurs in the process.

Hesse confirmed that they were - echoing the same crude language - and they soon found themselves surrounded.

Hesse said he was pushed back and promptly punched in the face.

'After that, it just kind of got messy . . . [I felt] terrified,' he recalled. 

He identified Harrigan as the man who  hit him in the head while Knott 'smacked or hit' him in the head and called him a 'f***ing fa**ot.'

In a matter of minutes, Hesse's boyfriend was lying in a pool of blood with a broken jaw and broken cheekbones. 

A nearby resident called 911, and the alleged attackers took off.

Security video posted online by police helped identify the group, many of them friends from their days at a suburban Catholic high school. 

The incident in downtown Philadelphia's tony Rittenhouse neighborhood swirled on news and social media sites in September. 

It has alternately been described as a routine street fight or a homophobic attack in a state that doesn't include sexual orientation in its hate crime law.

Less than a month after the incident, ABC News reported that Knott was fired from her job as an emergency room technician due to her questionable social media behavior.

Her Twitter account featured homophobic and racist remarks along with brags about frequent drunkenness.

Boasts suggesting special treatment from her father also came to light.

Commenting on Tuesday's ruling, Assistant District Attorney Mike Barry said: 'I think this court knows, it's going to be an interesting trial.'

He asked Common Pleas Judge Charles Hayden to leave the answer to a jury.

The judge agreed and ordered the defendants to return to court in January to enter pleas. 

Defense lawyers vow to mount a vigorous defense for their clients. In court Tuesday, they compared the case to a street brawl, arguing that both parties took part.

'We don't have a conspiracy, a wolf pack, a group of young people seeking to beat people up on the streets of Philadelphia,' defense lawyer Fortunato Perri Jr. argued.

Prosecutors took a darker view and called the initial query about the men's sexuality 'fighting words.'

'They got attacked just for being who they were,' Barry said. He said defendant Harrigan ignited the fight when he hurled a slur at Hesse and threw the first punch.

Witness Geoff Nagle, who was looking out a third-floor window, said he saw a woman pointing a finger at one of the victims and then heard three to four punches land. 

He took a cellphone photo and called 911.

Prosecutors said they believe co-defendant Williams moved through the crowd to 'sucker-punch' Haught. 

However, the defense said he went to Knott's aid after Haught struck her.

'Phil Williams is not initially an aggressor here,' Perri argued. 'He gets involved after a female is punched. ... That is actually justified, under the circumstances.'

The three defendants, who are free on bail, are scheduled to appear in court January 6 for their arraignments.

They are the only members of the larger party to be charged.
