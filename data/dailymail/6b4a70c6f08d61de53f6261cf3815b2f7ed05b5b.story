From elegant chignons to elaborate curls, there's no shortage of hairstyles for women to try. But for long-haired men, the options have been few - until now.

Bored with seeing the same styles, blogger Jessica Saia decided to give men the chance to try the looks loved by the ladies - with entertaining results.

She explains: 'One of my co-workers 
was talking about men with top-knots, and I said "Wouldn’t it be funny 
if they got, like, prom-style up-do’s instead?" We agreed that it would 
be funny, and so [the project] began.

'I found eight guys with long hair and [asked] them [to] meet me at Salon Miel in downtown San Francisco to get their 
hair styled in to formal up-do’s - until now reserved for women on 
their way to a wedding or a prom.

'The stylists came up with a "story" 
for each guy, and the photographer took before and after photos. The 
after photos were a bit of a struggle because no one could stop 
laughing.'

Among the styles given to her eight brave volunteers were the 'Brigitte Bardot' (tumbling glossy waves), the 'Junior Prom' (an elaborate up-do) and the 'Mother of the Bride' (a backcombed chignon).

Although the project was originally conceived as an amusing photo essay, the reaction to the photos has surprised Jessica.

Pretty: 'Blushing bohemian' Mat Dunlop had his hair braided into plaits for the Hippie Wedding look

Creative: Not content with his romantic up-do, Dunlop accessorised with flowers in both hair and beard

OMG! Andres Ruiz works a pretty up-do perfectly suited to Junior Prom - even with neck hair

Cute: With a delicate sprig of flowers to complete the look, all Ruiz needs now is a date and a tuxedo

'Honestly, I just thought it would be a funny photo essay,' she reveals. '[But] when I told my roommate about it she was like "Ohhh, I just love how you’re challenging gender norms!" and at the time I was like "No! You’re thinking too hard! It’s just guys with fancy hair, that’s it."

'But, looking at it now, it can’t help but at least nod in that direction. More than that though, if we’re going to look at it seriously, I think it speaks to the fact that men are cheated when it comes to style.

Schoolmarm? Eric looks a touch severe with his matronly chiignon but gets a manly touch from the quiff

'Both men and women can grow their 
hair out but women have an insane number of websites and magazines 
dedicated to all their styling options, whereas what’s "acceptable" for 
men is basically a lackluster low ponytail or maybe a bun.

'This
could have so easily gone in the direction of drag, but I think by 
staying away from makeup and having them wear whatever they came in 
with, it instead asks the question, "Yeah, why don’t men get to do more 
fun things with their hair?"

'Many people have commented that the after's look even better than the before's.'

The photoshoot took longer than anticipated as many of the subjects got the giggles as they were being made over
