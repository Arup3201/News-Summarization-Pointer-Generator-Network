These women make a living pouring beers and collecting tips but they aren't your average bartenders.

They call themselves 'skimpies' and can earn up to $6,000 a night by travelling to pubs in remote towns in Western Australia just to entertain miners and farmers in their lingerie.

Shae, 29, has worked as a skimpy for almost a decade and says the money is the biggest draw card for the 300-odd women in the industry.

'The money is very good, that's why we put up with so much s***,' Shae told Daily Mail Australia.

'We get paid a base rate to be at the pub around $1,000, but you can earn five times on top of your base rate from tips during a four hour shift.'

Shae and her colleagues feature in a new documentary called Skimpy that will air on ABC2 on Monday night to shed light on their careers as skimpily-dressed bartenders. 

'You've got to be comfortable with who you are and the way you look to do this,' Shae said. 

'We meet a lot of weird characters who will pick on you for personal things like if they don't think you're the right body shape. So you really have to have a thick skin, especially when alcohol is involved.

'We do get hit up all the time for 'extra' stuff. It generally scares off the new girls because they don't know how to handle it.

'I just turn it around and make a joke of it. You get some dudes being creepy and I just refer them to the brothel.

'A guy once paid me $50 to take my shoe off and take a photo of my foot and other men have offered to buy my underwear. There's always something interesting going on.'

Shae, who can travel four to five hours for a four-hour shift in regional WA, said it took several years to learn to deflect criticism and build up the confidence she has now.

Shae said it took several years to learn to deflect criticism and build up the confidence she has now

'I remember when I first started I'd have a complex. Some shifts I'd run off to the bathroom to cry because of someone saying something to me,' she said. 

'But majority of the customers just want to chat and have a good laugh. Some guys have been out bush for 60 days so they just like having a female to talk to.'

Skimpy documentary director Mariel Thomas spent a week on the road with Shae and her colleagues as they worked a bar circuit.

'What I found surprising was the skimpies are part of the furniture at these venues,' Ms Thomas told Daily Mail Australia. 

Skimpies are as much a part of the WA mining landscape as road trains and stubbies and whenever men have flocked to mining boomtowns, women providing the entertainment haven't been far behind.

'What I love about these girls is that they are really sassy and smart. They're party girls but I was expecting clichés and stereotypes,' Ms Thomas said. 

'A lot of them are just doing it to save for university or to buy a house.' 

While Shae turns 30 next month, she admitted she wasn't ready to give up being a skimpy. 

'I'm studying at the moment - I'm doing a dress making design course. I want to be able to eventually design costumes for the girls,' she said. 

'I can't just walk away from this lifestyle and the money, it's been too long. So I'll just combine both of my careers.'

Skimpy airs on Monday, November 17 at 9.30pm on ABC2.
