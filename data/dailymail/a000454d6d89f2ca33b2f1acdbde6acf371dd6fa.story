A 'backroom butcher' who used a five-kilo sledgehammer to 'stun' piglets before slaughtering the animals and then trying to sell them to pub goers has walked free from court.

Stefan Holub, 38, smashed in piglets skulls in a shed next to The Crewe Arms Hotel, where he worked previously as a handyman in Madeley Heath, on the Cheshire-Staffordshire border.

But Holub's sideline was brought to an end when a concerned resident alerted the authorities to the fact animals were being killed on the premises.

When they raided the pub  in October 2013, officers from Staffordshire County Council and Newcastle Borough Council discovered three halves of two piglets in the kitchens, wrapped in clingfilm. 

Prosecutor Lucy Daniels told North Staffordshire Magistrates Court: 'The piglets were completely skinned and gutted.

'The head chef in the kitchen said half of a piglet carcass had been offered for sale at the pub, but no one had purchased it that day and it had been disposed of.'

The court heard how Holub approached one of the animal health officers during the raid and admitted killing pigs in the shed. 

Ms Daniels said the piglets had come in a wooden box, adding: 'Before killing them, he used a sledgehammer to stun them and then hung them in the shed.'

The animal health team consulted a senior vet from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), who examined photos of the evidence.

He estimated the sledgehammer used by Holub, of Madely, weighed around five kilos.

Ms Daniels told the court: 'Attempting to stun a small piglet with a sledgehammer, without the proper means of restraining the animal, is likely to cause the animal suffering.

'A misplaced blow could also cause serious injuries without stunning.'

Several samples were later taken and sent for analysis. They included black coarse hair and a red substance which turned out to be blood containing pig DNA.  

Holub - who had experience of killing animals as he had previously worked in slaughterhouses in France and Switzerland - admitted failing to prevent unnecessary suffering to two piglets and failing to ensure their welfare on Thursday.

He was sentenced to six weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months, and was also ordered to pay £700 costs and an £80 victim surcharge.

Trevor Massey, chairman of the bench, told him: 'We are quite horrified by your actions.

'In all my time as a magistrate, I've not come across anything like this before.

'There were two incidents of ill-treatment, the use of a weapon - a sledgehammer - and two animals affected.'
