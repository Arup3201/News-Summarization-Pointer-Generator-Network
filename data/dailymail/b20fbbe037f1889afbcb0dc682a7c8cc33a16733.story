A safety gadget has been devised for athletes to prevent serious head injuries occurring.

The Jolt Sensor device monitors the movement of players, keeping track of any dangerous impacts.

Any potential threat causes the clip - worn on the player's head - to vibrate and send a wireless message to referees, as well as parents and coaches on the sidelines.

The Jolt Sensor device monitors movements of players, keeping track of any impacts that happen. A threat causes the clip - worn on the player's head - to vibrate and send a wireless message to referees, as well as parents and coaches in the event of a potentially dangerous impact

The gadget was created by CEO Ben Harvatine from St. Louis, Missouri after he suffered from concussion himself.

A concussion is a brain injury and all are serious. Most occur without loss of consciousness.

Recognition and proper response to concussions when they first occur can help prevent further injury or even death.

A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury, or TBI, caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head that can change the way your brain normally works.

Concussions can also occur from a blow to the body that causes the head to move rapidly back and forth. Even what seems to be a mild bump or blow to the head can be serious.

Concussions can occur in any sport or recreation activity. So all coaches, parents, and athletes need to learn concussion signs and symptoms and what to do if a concussion occurs.

It is hoped the Jolt Sensor will help reduce serious concussion by encouraging sportsmen to stop play at the time of injury.

The company are aiming to start shipping the product in April 2015, with a Kickstarter campaign currently taking place to raise £36,000 ($60,000). 

'I don't know the actual moment that I got my concussion,' said Mr Harvatine in a video.

'Between dehydration, a boiling hot practice room and repeated knocks to the head, I didn't know why I was dizzy.

'I just pushed through it like I always did. By the time I realised something was wrong, it was too late. I struggled to find the right words, any words, as I staggered into the trainers' room.

'Through the ensuing hospital visits and months of recovery, the same thing kept crossing my mind. How could this have been prevented?' 

The gadget was created by Ben Harvantine from Missouri after he suffered a head injury. When activated and an impact is detected, referees and coaches  can be alerted to serious head injuries and take action.

The sensor, which has a range of over a hundred yards, stays connected anywhere on the field to ensure a dangerous impact never goes unnoticed.

When an incident is detected, officials, parents and coaches can be immediately notified that the athlete should be medically evaluated on the sideline with the app's built-in cognitive test.

The results of this test are compared with baseline scores and used with the impact data to enable parents and coaches to make more informed decisions.

All of this data is then stored in the cloud, for quick and easy access by the athlete and their doctor.

The device syncs with an app, sending data as it goes. Co-founder Seth Berg said: 'The most dangerous thing an athlete can do after suffering concussion is to get back on the field and continue playing. The symptoms can take time to fully develop. This is why we have created the Jolt Sensor'

Co-founder Seth Berg said: 'The most dangerous thing an athlete can do after suffering concussion is to get back on the field and continue playing.

'The symptoms can take time to fully develop. This is why we have created the Jolt Sensor. It's a small clip that easily attaches to any headwear.

'In a collision, it vibrates wirelessly to a smartphone so from the sideline you know about the dangerous impact.

'Parents and coaches are immediately notified using the built in cognitive tests.

'We want every young athlete to grow up wearing a jolt sensor.'
