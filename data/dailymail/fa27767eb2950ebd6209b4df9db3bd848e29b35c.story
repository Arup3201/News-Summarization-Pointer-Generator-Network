Confession: San Jose State University President Mohammad Qayoumi said in a statement he and other school officials could have done more to protect the black student fro0m harassment

The president of San Jose State University has admitted that he 'failed' an African-American student whose white roommates were charged with hate crimes and battery after allegedly clamping a bicycle lock on his neck and calling him ‘three-fifths’ of a person. 

The
 unnamed freshman from Santa Cruz said he was afraid to come home to the
 four-bedroom dormitory suite he had shared with Logan Beaschler, 18, 
Joseph Bomgardner, 19, and Colin Warren, 18, since late August.

The
 teens nicknamed the then-17-year-old 'three-fifths,' referring to how 
the government once counted black people as a fraction of a person, and 
simply 'fraction' when he protested to the name.

The roommates allegedly hung the Confederate flag and wrote 
the N-word on a chalk board in their living area, and locked the young man in his room.

Student protests have been held at the California college since the allegations came to light last week, with some 500 people talking part in a march on campus last Thursday, KTVU reported.

Three of the alleged victim’s former roommates were charged with misdemeanor hate crime and battery in connection to the racially charged harassment, which allegedly lasted for two months. They have been suspended from the university.

A fourth student, who is a juvenile, faces the same charges, according to the San Jose Mercury News. School officials have said that student also was suspended.

Calls have been made by prominent black leaders to upgrade the charges against the white students accused of hate crimes

San Jose State University President Mohammad Qayoumi, in a statement on Monday said he and other school officials could have done more to protect the black student.

‘By failing to recognize the meaning of a Confederate flag, intervene earlier to stop the abuse or impose sanctions as soon as the gravity of the behavior became clear, we failed him. I failed him,’ Qayoumi stated.

The university will appoint an independent expert to lead a task force that will examine the case and propose reforms, Qayoumi said, adding that campus officials should have helped student residence hall advisors recognize signs of abuse.

On Saturday, Reverend Jethroe Moore II, the head of the San Jose/Silicon Valley NAACP, demanded the suspects’ charges be upgraded from misdemeanors to felonies, according to the Los Angeles Times.

'This is not simple hazing or bullying. This is obviously racially based terrorism targeted at their African American roommate,' Moore insisted. 'The community will not stand idly by and allow for any student of color to be terrorized simply due to the color of his skin.'

Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen in a statement Monday said he and colleagues ‘understand the outrage’ of those calling for stiffer charges. But he said the charges are not ‘a reflection of the degree of ... racism’ the men are accused of displaying.

‘The charges are a reflection of their criminal conduct,’ Rosen said. ‘To date, we have charged the perpetrators with the most serious crimes based on the facts.'

'I'm still in shock,' the freshman, now 18, told the Santa Cruz Sentinel in a phone interview last week, adding that he'd never experienced such horrific treatment despite being one of only a few black students at his Santa Cruz high school.

He said he didn't report the situation to campus police because he hoped it would stop.

'I tried not to dwell on this. But my family is upset and I'm upset,' he said.

He later told university police he always locked his door at night because he was scared of most of the other students he lived with and said his grades suffered because he didn't feel safe studying in his room.

The young men confessed to the 
relentless harassment in police interviews but denied their actions were
 racist, insisting instead the incidents were good-humored 'pranks.'

Abuse: The suspects confessed to police that they wrestled the black freshman to the ground and put a metal bike lock, similar to that pictured, around his neck

University police, however, recommended District Attorney Jeff Rosen file the case as a hate crime and prosecutor Erin West emphatically agreed.

'The District Attorney's Office has no tolerance for those who criminally prey on others because they are different,' West told the newspaper.

The students could face penalties ranging from probation to a year in jail if convicted. The university hasn't determined what sanctions it will hand down as its investigation is ongoing.

The bullied student was assigned to live with seven young white men in the house in late August. In mid-October, his parents noticed a Confederate flag draped in the living room of the suite and the 'N-word' scrawled on a surface in the living room.

Concerned, they reported it to housing officials who notified campus police and two of the roommates were immediately transferred to a different dorm.

However, the San Jose Sentinel cites police reports as saying at least two residential assistants were already aware a Confederate flag was being displayed in the house.

But instead of reporting the students, they asked the young men to take it out of a window 'so it could not be seen by the general public.'

When asked about the Confederate flag, Beaschler reportedly told police it was a meant as an edgy joke to 'ruffle people's feathers' and referred to his Southern California roots, San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The harassment was allegedly spurred on by a two-day orientation session that included sensitivity training.

According to reports, the teens blocked the freshman's bedroom door with furniture on multiple occasions to prevent him from coming out.

Another time, the suspects confessed to police, they wrestled him to the ground, putting a metal bike lock around his neck. The second time they tried this, he managed to escape but came away with bruises, he told police.

In another instance, they took the doorknob from inside a closet and attempted to coerce the claustrophobic freshman to step inside with a series of nasty post-it notes.

Nazi symbols, including swastikas and the 'SS' symbol, were found in the apartment and also a picture of Adolf Hitler, the Sentinel reported.

When the alleged victim's father talked to the roommates and reported the bullying, the freshman received a sarcastic and at times threatening apology note that cited 'the Beloved Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr.' and was signed off 'The Residents.'

'The Residents have welcomed you, it is not advised to ignore the call of The Residents,' read a postscript.
