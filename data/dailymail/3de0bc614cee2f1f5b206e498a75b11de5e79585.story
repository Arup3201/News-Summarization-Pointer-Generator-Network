Disgraced: Jamie Climie, 36, a wife and mother from Ohio who resigned last month from her teaching position at  Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy, has been charged with lying to police about having her smart phone stolen after her naked photos surfaced online

A former Ohio Christian school teacher who resigned last year after X-rated photos of her ended up online has been arrested for allegedly lying to police about her cell phone being stolen.

Law enforcement officials in West Chester said Jamie Climie, 36, a married woman with young children, was not telling the truth when on November 24, 2013, she reported her iPhone 4S stolen.

The Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy fifth-grade science teacher told police that her phone contained racy images of herself that she had only sent to her husband, the station WCPO reported.

Climie's theft claim came just one day after several graphic pictures surfaced on the site My Ex specializing in so-called 'revenge porn.' On one X-rated site, Climie’s nude selfies drew 110,000 views, WKRC reported.

The 36-year-old wife and mother was initially placed on administrative leave from the private Cincinnati school before quitting her teaching position last month.

The school has a code of conduct and morality that staff must agree to abide by, Academy spokeswoman Jennifer Murphy said. 

At the time, Climie's husband told local news outlets that he and his wife had no idea how the intimate photos got leaked.

One photo is a selfie taken in a 
private home's bathroom mirror. The blonde, tan woman in the image is 
completely naked with one of her hands on her hip and the other with the
 smartphone camera.

The website on which the racy images were posted is full of comments from users who appeared familiar with the teacher.

'Really
 sad, but not surprising. I've seen her at the gym and heard rumors 
about her and others before. Feel terrible for the husband and kids! 
They don't deserve this!' wrote one.

'This
 person is not innocent, she was a teacher at [redacted] several years 
ago and was fired for inappropriate behavior with her students. I was a 
teacher at this school and couldn't believe the things that went on,' 
commented another.

'Yes I 
know... That's the school she was having an affair with a coach at... 
She makes memories at each and every school she teaches... That's funny,
 ex-boyfriend? She's been with her husband for over 10 years , her fake 
boobs are recent and she's wearing her wedding ring in the picture in 
her car where she's showing her fake boobs!' another wrote.

Forensic investigators have spent the past month pouring over cell phone records and tracking IP addresses, only to reveal that Climie had sent at least one nude photo to someone other than her spouse.

Confronted with the truth, Mrs Climie admitted that her phone was never stolen.

On January 16, the woman was charged with obstruction of official police business. She turned herself in five days later and was released on her own recognizance,

This is not the first time the Academy has been embroiled in a scandal. In 2012, the school withdrew its offer of employment to a male science teacher after discovering he was gay.

Jamie Climie is due back in court February 4.
