Mitt Romney has begun introducing himself as the man who lost the election.

The failed Republican presidential candidate is said to have embarrassed those present in boxer Manny ‘Pacman’ Pacquiao’s dressing room following his sensational knockout, and introduced himself as the man who ran for president…and lost. 

‘Hi Manny,’ the former Massachusetts governor said. ‘I’m Mitt Romney. I ran for president. I lost.’

That had to hurt: Romney's shocked expression was caught on camera the exact moment the Filipino boxer was knocked out

As the New York Times reports, Romney
paid a visit to Pacquiao’s dressing room ahead of the fight at the MGM 
Garden Grand Arena in Las Vegas, adding a splash of surrealism to the 
night.

His frank introduction, the Times noted, was ‘at once awkward and hilarious.’

Despite the political bruising 
inflicted by his Democratic opponent on November 6th, Romney watched 
Marquez, 39, knock out Pacquiao, 33, in the sixth round. 

Attending
with wife Ann, Mitt Romney was a guest of the Nevada State Athletic 
Commission chairman Bill Grady at the MGM Grand hotel arena as they 
witnessed the fourth contest between the two welterweights.

Grady had been a donor during Romney's presidential campaign.

Before the fight Romney visited Pacquiao in his dressing room, wishing him well in the bout.

'Hello Manny. I ran for president. I lost,' Romney said to the fighter, according to Pacquiao publicist Fred Sternburg.

titles in an unprecedented eight weight divisions. 'Have a great night. 
Good to see you.'

The Romneys arrived during the undercard, drawing little reaction from the crowd.

But in the sixth round, Juan Manuel 
Marquez knocked Pacquiao out cold with a vicious right hand at the
end of the sixth round Saturday night, putting a ferocious end to the 
fourth fight between the two boxers.

'Hi Manny. I'm Mitt Romney. I ran for president. I lost.'

Pacquiao had been down in the third round but knocked Marquez down in the fifth and the two were exchanging heavy blows in the sixth round before Marquez threw a right hand that flattened Pacquiao face down on the canvas at 2:59 of the sixth round.

The referee waved the fight to an end as Marquez celebrated and the sold-out crowd at the MGM erupted. Pacquiao was down for about two minutes before his handlers managed to get him up.

While Pacquiao will hope that he left nothing in the locker room despite his defeat it emerged that Romney had $25.7 million left in the bank days after the November 6th election.

President Obama defeated the Republican candidate following a campaign that cost more than $2 billion overall.

Reactions: Twitter users were quick to make jokes after they learned of Romney's meeting with Pacquiao

Cause and effect? One user joked that Pacquiao lost because he had Romney's support

Obama's re-election effort had $14.2 million left as of November 26th, according to the Federal Election Commission disclosures.

Leftover campaign cash is common and often goes to the national party or other candidates.

The Romney campaign on Thursday said every raised dollar had gone toward Romney's run and that it 'continues to process invoices for pre-election expenses.'

It expected to have less than $1million by the end of the year.

'It
is not uncommon. It is of course a great risk,' said Sheila Krumholz, 
executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics that tracks 
campaign finance. 'As a loser you want to make sure you've given it your
all.'

Obama and Romney 
both spent much of their campaign cash on voter outreach and especially 
advertising. But the Democrat and his "Super PAC" backers at Priorities 
USA Action, an unlimited-spending group, held an early advertising game 
advantage.

Obama's campaign dominated the airwaves, booking the increasingly expensive spots earlier and at the lowest price.

The 'super"' political action committee, which was legally barred from coordinating with the campaign, ran a series of aggressive ads about Romney's private equity past that portrayed him as a corporate raider.

The damaging ads, as well as negative press surrounding Romney's disparaging '47 percent' comment about Americans relying on government funds, contributed to the candidate's defeat.

Since losing the election, Romney has been spotted carrying out a series of unglamorous, everyday activities, like pumping his own gas, going to bulk store Costco, and going to see the latest 'Twilight' movie with his wife.
