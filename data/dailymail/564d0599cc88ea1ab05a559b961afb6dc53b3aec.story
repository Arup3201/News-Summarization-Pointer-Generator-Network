A  23-year-old man has been accused of shooting six of his neighbour's cow in the face — because, he says, they were eating his horse feed.

Justin DeLoach from Bunnell, Florida, was charged with the second-degree felony of killing or aggravated abuse of horse or cattle.

According to authorities, his neighbour heard gunshots during the afternoon of October 26, and headed outside to investigate.

Mugshot: Justin DeLoach, pictured in this police photograph, told the sheriff's office he shot the cows because they were eating horse feed on his land

He found his cows missing from his property and a gate open.

DeLoach told the sherriff's office 
that the animals had 'busted' past his fence and onto his land where 
they ate all of the feed for his horses.

'Justin stated that he has been dealing with the cows coming onto his property for years,' the police report states.

The 23-year-old then claims he tried to scare the cows away by firing into the air.

But when the cows walked back to their owner, they were bleeding from numerous wounds on their faces, back legs and sides.

Six of the cows had been shot and two
were badly wounded. 

A veterinarian later examined the animals and said
the injuries are so significant, the value of the cows had been 
affected.

A 
neighbour told the farmer that a man who lived down the street (DeLoach)
had fired at the cows with what appeared to be a shotgun.

A local vet said the wounded cows will have lost much of their value after the shooting

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
