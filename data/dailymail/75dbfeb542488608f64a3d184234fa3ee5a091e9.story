If Rory McIlroy ends up pocketing $11.44 million on Sunday, he might look back on the 14th hole of his second round of the Tour Championship with particular affection.

A rare wayward tee shot during the course of an otherwise wonderful round on Friday could have been a card wrecker if it had stuck a tree and buried itself in the undergrowth. Instead it ricocheted kindly – and ended up in a spectator’s pocket. McIlroy was duly allowed a free drop, went on to make his par – and then closed with two birdies for a fabulous 65.

‘I think I probably owed the spectator rather more than a sweaty handshake,’ said McIlroy, smiling. ‘It could have gone anywhere and it really was a lucky bounce.’

This was more like it from McIlroy, who thought he had discovered something towards the end of his scrappy opening round and duly delivered. A wonderful climax to the PGA Tour season now seems assured this weekend with McIlroy tied for second place alongside Australian Jason Day and American Chris Kirk, who just happens to be leading the race for the FedEx Cup, with its alluring $10 million bonus.

Out on his own with a two stroke lead is last week’s winner Billy Horschel, who stands number two in the FedEx standings and, like Kirk, will not be going to the Ryder Cup.

What on earth must captain Tom Watson be thinking, sitting at home? Actually, Horschel, who shot 66 to continue his hot hand, gave us an idea when he revealed he had received a text from the five time Open Champion. It read: ‘Why didn’t you play like this earlier?’ .

Horschel has enough on his mind, considering his wife is due to give birth in a fortnight’s time. If all the excitement here causes her to go into labour, Horschel’s not moving. 

‘We’ve talked about it. Let’s be honest – how often do you get the chance to win a life-changing sum like $11.44 million?’ he said.

If McIlroy, Horschel or Kirk win the Tour Championship with its $1.44 million first prize, they will collect the $10 million as well. If Day wins, he will need help from the other three to collect the bonus.

Justin Rose was another UK representative who left contented, as he bounced back from his opening 72 with a fine 66. ‘It’s funny how you can climb out of bed and not feel any different but your scorecard can change dramatically,’ said Rose, who climbed to within six shots of the lead and into the top ten. ‘I guess it was just a cleaner round, as I cut out the mistakes. I also holed a few putts as well.’

As for the other two members of Europe’s four-strong Ryder Cup contingent, Martin Kaymer shot 69 while Spaniard Sergio Garcia lies tied 14th after a 71.

Meanwhile, just to add to Watson’s frustration, two of his wild card picks Hunter Mahan and Webb Simpson continued to struggle with rounds of 72. The only players below them are a pair of disinterested-looking Aussies – Geoff Ogilvy and John Senden. 

On the second hole, McIlroy knew he needed a positive day to propel himself up the leaderboard
