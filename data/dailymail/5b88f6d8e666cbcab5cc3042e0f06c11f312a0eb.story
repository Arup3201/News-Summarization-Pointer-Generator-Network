Former New Zealand captain Chris Cairns appeared in court on Thursday to face a charge of perjury linked to a libel action he brought in the UK in 2012.

Cairns won £90,000 in damages after he sued Lalit Modi, founder of the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament, over an accusation of match-fixing made on Twitter in January 2010.

But the 44-year-old was accused of perjury last month and appeared on Thursday at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London.

Cairns, of Clifton Road, Herne Bay, Auckland, appeared alongside barrister Andrew Fitch-Holland, who faces one count of perverting the course of justice.

Fitch-Holland, 49, of Duddenhoe End, Saffron Walden, Essex, is described on his chambers' website as 'lead adviser to former NZ captain Chris Cairns in his libel action against former IPL head Lalit Modi'.

The pair, dressed in dark suits, spoke only to give their names, dates of birth and addresses, and deputy chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot sent the case to Southwark Crown Court with the next hearing on October 16.

Cairns faced one count of perjury linked to a libel action he brought in the UK in 2012.

They were given unconditional bail.

Lawyers for the two men indicated that they would fully contest the allegations.

They left the court without commenting.
