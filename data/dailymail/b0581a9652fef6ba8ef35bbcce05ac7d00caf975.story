Baby boomers trying to ‘downsize’ are driving the housing market, say researchers.

Trading down from a large family house is now the single biggest reason given for selling by  homeowners approaching estate agents, says property market expert Rightmove.

Some 40 per cent of sellers say they are looking to trade down, compared with 25 per cent who hope to trade up to a larger more expensive property.

Downsize: Trading down from a large family house is now the single biggest reason given for selling by homeowners approaching estate agents

Trading down is the biggest reason for moving home in nine out of ten regions in England and Wales.

The only area where those trading up outnumbers those trading down is London, where there is a higher concentration of equity-rich buyers.

Rightmove said those trading down are generally from the baby boom generation, who have seen a sharp rise in the value of their homes in previous years, but are short of easily available cash.

The high cost of living, coupled with rock-bottom interest rates on savings and poor returns on personal pension investments, has left many retired people struggling to pay the bills.

At the same time, many need cash to help their adult children cover debts or pay for the deposit on a property of their own.

These people are rich on paper - in terms of property wealth - but they are short of the cash they need to fund their lifestyles and family commitments.

Rightmove said the trend in downsizing is putting a cap on house price rises, after it found that there was no increase in the average property asking price in May compared with April.

The company puts the average asking price across England and Wales at £243,759.

At the same time, the number of new properties coming on to the market was an average of 26,595 in May, which was down by 10per cent on April.

This is the first time there has been no increase in the 11 years it has been surveying the market.

Recent increases in mortgage interest rates have further dampened market activity, it said.

Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, said: ‘There are more old people at the top of the chain trying to downsize and fewer at the bottom trying or able to trade up.

'The ability to trade up is a vital component of a healthy housing market.

‘Some people may be facing redundancy and looking to reduce their outgoings, and others may be looking to supplement their underperforming pension pots.

'With overall market volumes already in the doldrums, we need a fair and consistent wind of mortgage lending to prompt a speedier housing market recovery.’

The recession and the fact banks and building societies are rationing mortgages also mean it is difficult for people to take out bigger loans in order to move up the property ladder.

At the same time, recent increases in mortgage interest rates have further dampened market activity.
