A Philadelphia, PA man with a taste for prostitutes was brutally killed last week by two he often met, as well as their pimp, according to police.

Francis Zarzycki, 40, was tasered, suffocated to death and chopped to pieces with an axe August 26 by Keith Tolbert, Angel Weston. 21, and Stephanie Foulke, 22, before they wrapped his torso in a plastic bag and dumped it in a local river, a police spokesperson told MailOnline.

The torso was found floating in the river without a head, arms or legs, the spokesperson said.

He has priors: Keith Tolbert, 34, has been accused of beheading and dismembering Francis Zarzycki, he has two prior arrests

Accused pimp: Mr Tolbert is no stranger to Philadelphia Police, they even published a mug shot from one of his prior arrests shortly after apprehending him

Mr Tolbert, 34, an alleged pimp, is accused of trying to rob Mr Zarzycki while he was in the middle of a tryst with the two hookers - who went by the names Angel and Cinderella - in a designated apartment in Center City, Philadelphia, according to reports.

‘He frequents there. He's been there before and I think they came up with the plan knowing he was coming there,’ Captain James Clark of Philadelphia Police said during a Thursday press conference.

When the robbery didn’t go as planned, both women subdued Mr Zarzycki while the pimp shot him with a taser before suffocating him to death, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

The brutal killing started in the living room before moving into the bathroom, according to officials.

Mr Tolbert is believed to have dragged Mr Zarzycki’s body to the bathroom, where he beheaded the dead John before hacking off his arms and legs in the bathtub with an axe or a hatchet, the paper said.

‘He comes there, he starts to deal with the two young ladies and then the male, Tolbert, comes back from another room and a struggle ensues,’ said Mr Clark. ‘At some point, they have a taser, he’s beaten, and he’s suffocated,’ he added.

Investigators have yet to find the axe, Zarzycki’s head, arms or legs, the spokesperson told MailOnline. There is surveillance video of him entering the apartment building where he was killed, according to reports.

Mr Zarzycki, a loan officer, was reported missing by his family shortly after he disappeared, according to WPVI. Police were able to trace him to the apartment, a front for prostitution, through his cell phone records and by accessing his computer, reported the station. They discovered visits to the notorious Backpage.com and calls to an unknown phone number, according to the Inquirer.

Backpage is known for having ads for prostitutes.

The mutilated corpse was discovered floating in the Schuylkill River Tuesday morning by a fisherman, and was able to be identified because of a tattoo across his upper back, according to KYW. The tattoo was of wings and a bull, according to the Inquirer.

Mr Zarzycki lived with his parents, who spent days searching for him and handing out missing posters offering a reward, according to reports.

Detectives removed large sections of 
drain pipe believed to contain Mr Zarzycki’s blood as well as pieces of 
his flesh, reports said.

Mr Tolbert's neighbors had mixed reactions.

'He had lots of girls running in and out of there,' Joan Taylor, 65, told the Inquirer while sitting on couch against a wall she shared with Mr Tolbert. 'They looked like crackheads.'

Telling WPVI that she was shaken and wanted to move because she no longer felt safe in the area, Kafi Roundtree said she never heard a struggle, but did hear music.

'I just thought it was a neighborly party,' she added, 'I didn't think it was anything serious.'

Both Mr Tolbert and Ms Weston have prior criminal histories, but the spokesperson declined to comment further, saying the department does not divulge such information.

All three suspects have been charged with murder, robbery and related offenses, and are being held while awaiting trial, the spokesperson told MailOnline.
