Mike Ashley doesn’t know what he’s let himself in for.

If the Newcastle United owner — who last week bailed out cash-strapped Rangers with a £2million loan — had taken up a seat in the director’s box at Dumbarton on Saturday, he would have been greeted by a sea of green.

With only one grandstand at the Bet Butler Stadium, spectators are treated to the spectacular, craggy Dunbartonshire landscape — punctuated only by the imposing, red-brick shell of a former whisky distillery which looms over the ground.

Outside, stewards had the unfamiliar task of turning away ticketless fans, while the hospitality area ploughed ahead with a wedding.

With 1,000 noisy fans on either side, it had the feeling of a plum FA Cup third tie, with the traditional footballing giants taking on the plucky non-league minnows.

In fact, neither Ashley, nor South African-based businessman Dave King or Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy — the prospective saviours of Ibrox — were in attendance as Rangers laboured to a 3-0 victory over their hosts.

If they had been there, the football on show would have been enough to make them change their minds.

There is no mistake Ally McCoist’s side were streets ahead of Dumbarton in terms of quality — but only in the way that the Vanarama Conference is superior to the Ryman League.

Rangers huffed and puffed, hitting over-hit cross after over-hit cross, long punt after long punt. Only the meagre flashes of brilliance from veteran front-man Kenny Miller and the marauding runs of left-back Lee Wallace came close to anything resembling the top-flight. The rest were mediocre.

‘They’re not Rangers players,’ one supporter told me as the squads warmed up beforehand. ‘They are just filling the gaps until we get back to the Premiership.’

Part of the problem lies with the management. While McCoist shepherded Rangers to two easy promotions into the Championship, the manager is faltering at the final hurdle with his side seven points behind Hearts at the summit.

Several fans think it is time for the Rangers legend to step aside, although shareholder Sandy Easdale confirmed that McCoist’s position is safe.

Many also believe that Sports Direct maestro Ashley sees the Glasgow club as a quicker, cheaper route into the Champions League than his team on Tyneside.

On this showing, it won’t be happening any time soon — and a manager with greater pedigree might be required to make those next giant leaps.

Simply getting out of the Championship will be trying. After all — with three of Scotland’s five best-supported teams vying for promotion, the second tier is incredibly competitive.

That was clear for all to see on Sunday when Hibernian and Hearts locked horns in the Edinburgh derby — a fixture which, until both clubs’ relegation, graced the Premiership.

Easter Road was also awash with a sea of green — albeit 10,000 singing and dancing Hibs fans.

It was about as far from Dumbarton as you can get. Close your eyes, and it could easily have been the derbies of North London, Merseyside or Tyne-Wear ringing in your ears.

And while the football wasn’t top notch, it was far more lively and enthralling than anything Rangers served up on Saturday.

Hibs took the game to their rivals — who are still unbeaten this season —and looked to be holding for a slender 1-0 victory going into injury time.

Then came a moment worthy of gracing Europe’s top table. Turkish centre-half Alim Ozturk hit a speculative 35-yard thunderer which sailed in off the crossbar.

Hearts have preserved their near-perfect start to the campaign because they resolved their financial difficulties in the summer.

While Ibrox has been playing billionaire bingo during the opening months of the season, the Tynecastle club has flourished under fan-ownership and Robbie Neilson’s side look dead-certs for an immediate return to the big time.

Hibs, too, have found their feet following relegation under new manager Alan Stubbs and his outfit will prove tricky opponents for Rangers if they met in the play-offs.

Today, Easdale heralded a renewed era of stability under Ashley. But they should be warned that restoring Rangers to greatness won’t be a stroll in the Dunbartonshire countryside.
