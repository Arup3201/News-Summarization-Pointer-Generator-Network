Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka has heavily criticised Wimbledon officials for their curious planning which leaves him with a ‘terrible’ schedule of three matches in three days.

The world No 3 beat Denis Istomin 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in their third round match today that was delayed from Saturday when rain wiped nearly five hours from play.

The pair were due to be third on No 1 Court but were told their match would be postponed for the weekend despite Wawrinka pointing out they could have been fitted onto an outside court, replacing a junior or doubles match, once the weather got better.

Outclassed: Denis Istomin was beaten in straight sets by Stan Wawrinka

He said 
the referees’ office claimed it would be a security risk to place his 
match on a smaller court and suggested officials look after their own 
interests rather than the players’.

Wawrinka, 29, now faces a tiring
 programme of a fourth round match against either Feliciano Lopez or 
John Isner on Tuesday, before a potential quarter-final clash on 
Wednesday.

‘For
 sure I was disappointed,’ Wawrinka said. ‘If you look for this week, me
 or Lopez or Isner have to play three matches in three days. Five-set 
matches. It’s terrible for the body.

‘I
 was expecting them to move matches, move maybe juniors or doubles, to 
make my match or the Isner-Lopez match first on when they started again 
at 5.00pm or 6.00pm when it stopped raining.

‘They
 played doubles five-set match on Saturday on many courts. I was 
surprised because they told us (their match was suspended), but then 
they start to play all matches. It was a perfect day to finish actually 
and they play so many matches.

‘They
 said for security reasons, they didn’t want to put our match on a small
 court. But Kei Nishikori was playing on a small court. All the other 
matches were playing on small courts.’

He added: ‘You cannot do anything. You have to accept. They do what they want and you just follow. They
 just say what's going to be the schedule and that's it. Even if you 
want to talk to them, they're not going to change anything. They don't 
listen the player. They just do what they think is good for them.

‘I'm
 used to it here. They just do what they think is good for them and 
that's it. Normally, if the player starts to talk to the referee, they 
never change the decision. You have to accept it.’

All
 England Club officials insisted that 'major marquee players' - of which
 Wawrinka is one due to his Grand Slam success - must be scheduled on 
show courts as 'expected by paying public and TV audiences alike'.

Scheduling
 guidelines also state that players with 'a large fan following will 
usually, by necessity, be scheduled on courts offering the greatest 
security'.
