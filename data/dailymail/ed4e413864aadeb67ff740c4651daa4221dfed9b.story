As Sherry Marino made her way to the cemetery on Wednesday to tend the grave marked with her son’s name, she got a call from her lawyers - the body wasn't his.

It was the news she had been waiting more than 30 years to hear. Tests had confirmed that the remains of one of 
John Wayne Gacy’s victims which police told her in 1980 were her missing son Michael Marino did not match her DNA.

In 1978, police identified one of the
bodies found on Gacy’s property in Norwood Park Township, Illinois as 
her son. He was 14 when he disappeared in 1976 and investigators had used dental
records to identify him in 1980.

Killer: John Wayne Gacy murdered 33 people and became known as the Killer Clown as he would dress as a character, Pogo the Clown, at  parades and children's parties

Between 1972 and 1978, John Wayne Gacy killed 33 teenage boys or young men at his Chicago, Illinois home.

He occasionally lured the men for sex by impersonating a police officer or promising them construction work.

He stabbed the first victim, 15-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy, and strangled the others.

Most were buried in a crawl space under his home. Four others were dumped in a river.

Investigators were alerted to Gacy after a boy went missing who he had been talking with him about construction work.

On searching his home, they found a series of odd items - such as clothes too small for Gacy - and the smell of decay.

Gacy was executed by lethal injection in 1994.

His last words were 'Kiss my ass.'

Gacy became known as the Killer Clown as he would dress as a character, Pogo the Clown, at  parades and children's parties.

For years Marino had fought to have the grave exhumed and now almost 36 years after her son first disappeared her long-held misgivings were proved to be well-founded.

Scientists at a North Carolina 
laboratory compared bone DNA of the victim to that provided by Sherry Marino and determined that they could not be related.

'We are very happy that we followed 
through because her suspicions were 100 percent correct,' Steven Becker, who represents Sherry Marino, told the Chicago Sun-Times.

'She hopes the information 
about his misidentification will bring more leads to find Michael.'

After years of tending the grave, but convinced that it wasn't Michael, Marino approached Becker and Robert Stephenson of Becker Stephenson, who agreed to work on her behalf, pro bono.

After fighting bureaucracy, they succeeded in finally having the body unearthed.

Late last year, Sherry Marino requested 
that the body, one of more than two dozen found in the crawlspace of 
Gacy's home in late 1978, be exhumed to determine if the remains buried 
at the cemetery were her son's.

Days later, the Cook County 
Sheriff's department said it had exhumed the remains of several young 
men believed to be, but never identified, as Gacy victims.

During
last year's hearing, Sherry Marino's attorneys said she wondered why 
the clothes on the remains did not match the clothing she remembers 
seeing her son wear the day he disappeared.

Further, they said she never
understood why it took more than three years to identify her son, 
despite the fact that she provided dental records shortly after the 
bodies were discovered.

Even her attorneys has acknowledged that there
was strong circumstantial evidence that the remains - identified as 'body 14' - were those of Michael Marino, including that the remains 
were found in Gacy's crawl space next to those of Marino's friend, 
Kenneth Parker, who disappeared the same day.

The orthodontist who initially examined Gacy's victims remains convinced his findings are correct.

'The dental identification is just 100 percent solid, absolutely no 
question,' said Dr. Edward Pavlik. 'We compared 32 teeth, probably half a
dozen of them had very distinct fillings and every tooth was consistent
with the dental records of Michael Marino.'

The attorneys said
Thursday that the lab's findings do not necessarily mean Marino was not
a Gacy victim, but that it raises questions, such as whether other 
victims may have been misidentified.

'We don't know where Michael
Marino is but what we do know is he's not buried in Queen of Heaven 
Cemetery under a tombstone that says "Michael Marino,"' Becker said.

Gacy, a building contractor and amateur 
clown, was convicted of luring 33 young men and boys to Chicago-area 
home and strangling them between 1972 and 1978, sentenced to death and 
executed in 1994.
