Sheyi Ojo sparkled as Liverpool continued their unbeaten start to the Barclays Under 21 Premier League season with a comprehensive win over West Ham at Upton Park.

The 17-year-old winger showed precisely why he is so highly rated by both Liverpool and England with an eye-catching performance capped by a couple of excellent goals.

With Liverpool leading 1-0 approaching the half-hour, Ojo curled a beautiful shot from outside the box into the top right-hand corner to double the lead, leaving Hammers goalkeeper Raphael Spiegel rooted to the turf.

It was the highlight of an evening in which West Ham simply couldn’t handle the England Under 18 international, who signed professional terms at Anfield over the summer.

If his long-range goal drew gasps from the crowd, his assist for Liverpool’s opening goal was equally as memorable.

Turning on a sixpence, Ojo left two defenders for dead and, with a burst of acceleration, advanced to the edge of the box. After feigning to shoot, he instead tucked a through ball to Ryan Kent to slot home from six yards.

And when forward Samed Yesil added a third for the visitors shortly before half-time, the contest was all over.

Yasil was set up by an unfortunate deflection off a West Ham defender, allowing him to beat the offside flag.

It was a fitting assist as this was an evening in which fortune did not smile on the Hammers as they wasted a string of excellent openings.

Man of the Match: Sheyi Ojo

Referee: Ryan Atkin 

Elliot Lee was the most culpable. Inside two minutes, he was presented with a gilt-edged chance when Sebastian Lletget’s shot cannoned back off the crossbar to him unmarked in front of goal.

Lee somehow failed to get the ball out of his feet and goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux, whose initial mis-kick had allowed West Ham in, redeemed himself with an unlikely save.

And at three goals down, Lee had the chance to improve West Ham’s outlook just before the break. Played clear by Kieran Sadlier, he drew Vigouroux out but rolled his shot wide of the far post.

Lletget also failed to turn the ball home from all of three yards when Sam Westley crossed low from the right. His scuffed effort hit the base of the post, allowing Vigouroux, who was obviously wearing his lucky gloves, to claim.

So while West Ham were guilty of wasting their chances, and consequently are still seeking their first win of the campaign, Liverpool were lethal.

Ojo was the performer to catch the eye. There was a buzz around him when Liverpool paid £2m to take him from MK Dons as a 14-year-old, fending off competition from other leading clubs, and he has matured well under their auspices.

Sheyi Ojo is highly rated by both Liverpool and England, and the youngster showed why

He possesses raw pace and packs a fearsome and accurate shot, as West Ham found out to their cost when they stupidly backed off for the goal.

Kent, also 17, impressed too with his direct running and ability to find space in the box. He gave West Ham a warning in the third minute when his curled effort had to be blocked by Spiegel, but they didn’t heed it and were soon punished by the fleet-footed winger.

With the game pretty much decided, the second period failed to replicate the pace and flow of the first. Lee did his best to reduce the deficit but his looping header was tipped over the crossbar by Vigouroux.

And in the dying moments, he worked half-a-yard to force another smart save from the Chilean keeper.

Liverpool were sauntering away with the points and there was to be a final flourish when Ojo rolled home his second in stoppage time.
