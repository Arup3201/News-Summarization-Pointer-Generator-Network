The Coalition was accused of attempting to 'bury bad news' last night after belatedly publishing a  dossier acknowledging that it has failed to meet dozens of promises.

A 119-page audit lists all 400 pledges made when the Government was formed in 2010, and assesses its progress on each.

The document was produced as an annexe to the Coalition's 'mid-term review', which was published on Monday, but was not mentioned during a joint appearance by David Cameron and Nick Clegg on Monday.

David Cameron was forced to defend the decision to delay publishing the audit of coalition policies at Prime Minister's Questions, with Labour leader Ed Miliband accusing him of 'broken promises'

It only came to light when a Downing 
Street aide was photographed carrying another paper, marked 
'restricted', discussing whether or not the annexe should be published.

It suggested the release of the audit 
should be delayed, given that a focus on broken promises risked 
overshadowing favourable media coverage.

It also warned that the 
document might be seen as 'self-congratulatory', given that it claims 
the overwhelming majority of commitments – around 90 per cent – have 
been met.

The document, published hastily 
yesterday after its existence was revealed, admits some failures, but 
glosses over others and does not divide promises clearly into those 
which have and have not been met.

It notes that a planned badger cull had been 'postponed', a free vote on repealing the hunting ban has 'not yet been taken forward', accused rapists have not been given anonymity, and, after pledging to cancel a third runway at Heathrow, the Government is now 'looking at all the options'.

The document also concedes that the Government has failed to introduce elections to the House of Lords, increase renewable energy targets and create a single financial crime agency, which were all included in the original Coalition deal in 2010.

On marriage tax breaks, a flagship Tory commitment, it restates that the Lib Dems, who object to the move, will be allowed to abstain when MPs come to vote on the issue.

Labour accused the Coalition of an 'astonishing' omission as the audit failed to mention George Osborne's pledge in his emergency budget of 2010 to ensure that debt is falling as a share of GDP by 2015-16.

Instead, it said the Government was 'on course' to deliver a balanced structural budget by the end of a rolling, five-year forecast period.

The Prime Minister said the document offered a 'full, frank and completely unvarnished' assessment of how the Coalition has performed.

He told MPs: 'We said we would cut the deficit, it's down by 25 per cent. We said we would cut immigration, it's down by 25 per cent.

'We said we would rebalance the economy, one million private sector jobs. That is a record to be proud of.'

But at the first Prime Minister's 
Questions of the year, Labour leader Ed Miliband branded Mr Cameron  'a 
PR man who can't even do a relaunch'.

Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher 
added: 'This document highlights all the failures and broken promises 
and it is no wonder that David Cameron and Nick Clegg have sought to 
suppress this audit.'

Mr Cameron's official spokesman said 
the audit had not been ready for publication alongside the mid-term 
review on Monday simply because the process of 'copper bottoming' its 
accuracy had not been completed.

Nick Clegg and David Cameron launched the coalition's Mid-Term Review on Monday, but have been warned against being 'self-congratulatory' about an audit of policy successes to date

The existence of the audit of broken promises was revealed after Patrick Rock, a key advisor to the PM, was photographed carrying restricted documents while going into No10 Downing Street

The 36,000-word document detailing progress made in implementing the coalition agreement will admit dropping Lords reform and giving rape suspects anonymity

On Monday the government published the Mid-Term Review setting out policies to last until 2015, with Mr 
Cameron and Mr Clegg insisting in the foreword that their resolve is 
'unwavering'
