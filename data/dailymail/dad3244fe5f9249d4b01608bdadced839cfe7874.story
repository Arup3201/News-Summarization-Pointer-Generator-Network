Guilty: 'Tragic figure' Leonard Watters, pictured at an earlier hearing, apologised to Louis Walsh for the false claims

An unemployed dance teacher has been sentenced to six months in jail for falsely accusing X Factor judge Louis Walsh of groping him in a nightclub.

Leonard Watters pleaded guilty to making two false reports to Irish police that the pop music mogul sexually assaulted him in Dublin nightspot Krystle last April.

The 24-year-old father-of-two from Navan, Co Meath, who was described in court as a Walter Mitty-type character, had apologised publicly to Mr Walsh at the city’s District Court.

Passing sentence, Judge Dermot Dempsey immediately granted Watters bail to appeal against the decision, on condition that he lodged 100 Euros in cash with the court.

Pleading for a non-custodial sentence, Watters’ solicitor, Cahir O’Higgins, said his client was a tragic figure whose life had been a litany of disasters from an early age.

Watters was now a laughing stock and a joke, and had been treated as a pariah in his own community, he told the court.

'For ever and a day, he will be known as the guy who accused Louis Walsh in the wrong,' he said.

At a previous hearing, Watters apologised to Mr Walsh.

'I would like to sincerely apologise to Mr Louis Walsh for all the stuff I put him through. The allegation was false,' he said.

Detective 
Inspector Michael Cryan previously told the court the defendant had claimed the 
assault happened on Saturday, April 9, after Westlife had performed in 
Dublin's 02.

False allegations: Leonard Watters pleaded guilty to making two false reports to Irish police that pop music mogul Louis Walsh, pictured, sexually assaulted him in a Dublin nightclub

Watters and 
Walsh had been socialising in a pub and travelled to Krystle together, 
he said, but at about 4am to 4.30am Watters approached a Garda officer 
on patrol outside the celebrity spot on Harcourt Street alleging he 
had been sexually assaulted by Walsh.

The
defendant was taken to Mountjoy Garda Station where he made the same 
allegation, before being examined at a sexual assault unit - which 
revealed bruising in his genital area.

More
than two months later, on June 20, he showed investigators the toilet 
in the nightclub where he alleged the offence took place and made his 
first formal statement.

Within days Mr Walsh was interviewed under caution and denied the allegation, added Det Insp Cryan.

Watters made a second false statement on June 27 and was shown CCTV from the nightclub.

'It became obvious the CCTV did not support his allegations,' he added.

When Watters was arrested at his home on June 28 he admitted Walsh did not sexually assault him.

'He continued to claim he was sexually assaulted in the toilets but that Louis Walsh did not do it,' the Detective added.

Watters has previous convictions for 
breaching a barring order under domestic violence laws and driving 
offences.

Walsh
became a household name in 2004 when he was announced as a judge on X 
Factor and is the only remaining member of the original panel.

He has 
managed a number of groups and performers, including boy bands Boyzone 
and Westlife.
