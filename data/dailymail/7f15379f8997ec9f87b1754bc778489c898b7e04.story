It seems the baby of the family never grows up – at least in their mother’s eyes.

A study found that mothers routinely underestimate the height of their youngest child, in a phenomenon that may also explain why an older brother or sister often seems to grow up overnight on the birth of a sibling.

The Australian researchers began by asking more than 700 mothers if their child had  suddenly seemed bigger on the birth of a brother or sister. More than 70 per cent said this was the case.

The study found most mothers underestimated the height of their youngest child by almost 3 inches but accurately estimated how tall their oldest child was

To work out why, the Swinburne 
University of Technology team asked a second group of women to estimate 
the height of one of their children and mark it on the wall.

The
 children, aged between two and six, were then measured and the results 
compared with the estimates. Mothers got the height of elder children 
roughly right, but underestimated the height of their youngest children 
by three inches on average.

Study
 author Jordy Kaufman said: ‘The key implication is that we may treat 
our youngest child as if they are actually younger than they really are.

‘Our research potentially 
explains why the “baby of the family” never outgrows the label. To the 
parents, the baby of the family may always be “the baby”.’’

The
 researchers say their results show the perception that the eldest child
 suddenly appears bigger on the birth of a second child cannot simply be
 explained away by everything looking big compared to the newborn.

Australian scientists set out to uncover why it feels to many parents that their firstborn seems suddenly grown-up and bigger once they have brought a newborn baby home

Instead, parents seems to be subject to a ‘baby illusion’, in which they
 perceive the youngest child as being more fragile than he or she really
 is, and so the older child instantly seems bigger.

The
 study’s authors said: ‘This isn’t happening just because the older 
child looks so big compared to the baby, it happens because all along 
the parents were under an illusion that their first child was smaller 
than he or she really was.

'When the new baby is born, the spell is 
broken and parents see their older child as he or she really is.’

The
 journal Current Biology reports that the mental trick could be nature’s
 way of ensuring the youngest child gets the care it needs when it is at
 its most vulnerable.

However, the perception may last for years.

Perception of the youngest being much smaller and 
fragile helps parents to focus on them and care for them more
