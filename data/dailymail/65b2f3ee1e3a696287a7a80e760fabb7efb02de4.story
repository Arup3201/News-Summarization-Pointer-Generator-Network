Alan Saffery, 61 (pictured), from Hereford, groomed and abused the young girl, who is now  in her 40s, over a four-year period in the 1970s and 80s while he was serving as an officer with West Mercia Police

A retired police officer who groomed a 12-year-old girl to such an extent that he could 'help himself to her' whenever he wanted, has been jailed for 12 years.

Alan Saffery, 61, groomed and abused the young girl, who is now aged in her 40s, over a four-year period while he was serving as an officer with West Mercia Police.

Worcester Crown Court heard how the offences only came to light after being reported to police by the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, during a separate investigation.

Saffery, from Hereford, Herefordshire, has now been convicted of six counts of indecent assault and two counts of sex with a girl under the age of 13 following a trial.

He was jailed for 12 years for the historical sex offences, which took place in the 1970s and 1980s while the girl was aged between 12 and 15, and shouted 'it's all lies' as he was taken to the cells following sentencing yesterday.

The 'dangerous' sexual predator, who served as an officer for more than 30 years, was also convicted of two allegations of having child pornography images on his computer in 2013.

He was cleared of two further charges of raping a second girl aged under 16 in 1986.

During sentencing, Judge Robert Juckes QC said Saffery had helped the girl to become 'infatuated' with him and groomed her so he could 'help himself to her' whenever the opportunity arose.

He added: 'Your job was to protect members of the community, not to abuse them.'

The court heard Saffery groomed and repeatedly assaulted the victim while he was in his 20s and a serving police officer.

In a police video played to the jury, the victim said Saffery would take 'every chance' to engage in sexual activity with her.

She said: 'He would say nice things. He would tell me I was lovely and beautiful.

'A little girl would be flattered by that.

'I had a teenage crush on him. I was infatuated by him.'

The jury were told they first had sex when she was 12-years-old and it stopped when she was 15-years-old with her realisation that the 'relationship' was wrong.

But giving evidence, Saffery said he only had 'consensual' sex with the victim once at his home when she was aged 16.

Detective Inspector Richard Rees, from West Mercia Police, said after the case: 'Outwardly, Saffery was a respected police officer and an upstanding member of the community.

'However, behind closed doors he was a dangerous sexual predator who took advantage of a young girl.

'Today his past has caught up with him.'

Saffery retired as one of West Mercia Police's longest serving officers in 2002, with two commendations having tackled an armed robbery and surviving being stabbed.
