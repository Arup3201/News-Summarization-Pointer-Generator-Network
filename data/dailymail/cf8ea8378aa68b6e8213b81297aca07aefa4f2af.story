Almost twenty thousands people in Bermuda had their power cut off, and thousands were assailed by falling roof tiles and uprooting trees as Hurricane Gonzalo battered the tiny island.

More than 18,000 homes still have no electricity after the storm, which passed directly over the island Friday, hitting it with 110mph winds, which continued to strike hours after the storm left.

In the harbor, boats were dragged away from them moorings and crashed into one another. 

Premier Michael Dunkley said cleanup efforts were going smoothly. He said the U.S., Britain and other nations have offered assistance. Bermuda is a British territory with 65,000 inhabitants.

Dunkley tweeted: 'All hands were on deck and worked very well. Much to be done but we are roaring back!'

Nobody in Bermuda has been killed or seriously injured by the extreme weather. Earlier today residents were still urged to stay inside and keep off the roads.

Gonzalo approached Bermuda as a Category 3 storm then weakened to Category 2 strength just before coming ashore with sustained winds of 110 mph. Even after beginning to move away, its fierce winds battered the island for hours. 

Aftermath: Hurricane battered Bermuda for hours - and around 18,000 are still without power

Bad luck: The storm was the second to hit Bermuda in just a week, having been struck by Tropical Storm Fay last weekend

Fallen: Tiles were knocked off this church roof by Gonzalo, which has now tacked north into the Atlantic

Maria Frith, who owns Grape Bay Cottages on Bermuda's south coast, said that the hurricane woke her up before dawn when it tore the patio roof off her house.

'To be perfectly honest with you, I was terrified, partly because of the noise. 'It was really scary.'

Officials have not yet announced whether government offices and schools would reopen Monday. 

The island's international airport remained closed Saturday night but officials said it might reopen Sunday afternoon.

The island was still recovering from last weekend's blast from Tropical Storm Fay, which also damaged homes and toppled power lines.

Not sailing away: Though tress are down all over the island the damage is not catastrophic

‘To be struck twice by two different cyclones is unusual, to say the least,’ said Max Mayfield, a former director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Gonzalo weakened as it moved away from Bermuda on a track that would take it past Newfoundland and then across the Atlantic to Britain and Ireland.

Late Saturday, the storm was centered 360 miles southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland, with maximum sustained winds of 90 mphas it moved northeast at 39 mph.
