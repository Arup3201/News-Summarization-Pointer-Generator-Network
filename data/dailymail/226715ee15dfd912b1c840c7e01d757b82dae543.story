Tories have baffled residents of the Essex town of Clacton-on-Sea by asking them about their local Tube services – even though the nearest London Underground station is 60 miles away.

The party asked the bizarre question in a survey ahead of the by-election triggered by their MP Douglas Carswell’s defection to Ukip. 

A spokesman for Ukip said: ‘It appears the Conservatives think Clacton is somewhere north of Notting Hill on the Tube map.’

But Tories said thousands of people commute between London and Clacton – including Mr Carswell himself, who lives in Fulham, West London.

The closest station to Clacton is Upminster, the most easterly point on the District line.
