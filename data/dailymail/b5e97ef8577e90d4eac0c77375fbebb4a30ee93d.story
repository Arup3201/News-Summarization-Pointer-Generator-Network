Former England Under 21 manager Stuart Pearce has urged Ross Barkley to remain at Everton and reject any approach from Manchester City.

However, the Nottingham Forest boss conceded that if the proposed £50m was offered, the midfielder will probably end up at the Etihad Stadium.

Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman revealed that the Premier League champions were quoted the figure when they inquired about the youngster in June. 

Ross Barkley should work with Roberto Martinez at Everton and snub Manchester City, says Stuart Pearce

'Jack Rodwell went to Manchester City and never really featured,' Pearce told talkSPORT. 'He wasted a season or two, instead of playing at Everton a little while longer.

'My advice to Ross would be, 'sit tight, you've got a manager [in Roberto Martinez] who backs good young players'. You'll always have the option to move away [at a later date] if your form is good. 

'But if Everton get offered £50million then he'll end up going to Manchester City.'

Manuel Pellegrini and Txiki Begiristain believe Barkley is a perfect fit for the club and will attempt to re-open talks with Everton at the end of the season.
