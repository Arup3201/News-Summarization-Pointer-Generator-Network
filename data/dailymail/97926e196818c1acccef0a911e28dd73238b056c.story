A severely disabled teenager enjoying her last meal with her family before going into full-time care was ordered out of a Harvester pub for being too noisy.

Megan Brennan, 19, and her family were tucking into dinner at the Ham Farm Harvester in Eastleigh, Hampshire, last Saturday when staff asked them to leave.

The restaurant's manager complained that Miss Brennan, who has the mental age of a one-year-old, was annoying customers, the family say.

Severely disabled 19-year-old Megan Brennan and her mother, Helen, were asked to leave a Harvester restaurant because she was too 'noisy'

Miss Brennan, from Chandler's Ford, Hampshire, has Angelman syndrome - a genetic disorder which can cause sufferers to struggle with speech and have seizures. The 19-year-old communicates with her family by raising her voice and making sounds.

'Megan is moving into full-time care but her goodbye meal for her carers was completely ruined by ­being asked to leave,' her brother Jack told the Sunday People.

'It was horrible. I have never seen my mother so upset.

'After five minutes the manager came over and complained she was making too much noise.' 

According to Jack, the manager said: 'If you can't keep her quiet I am going to have to ask you to leave.'

Miss Brennan's brother added: '[The manager] claimed other people had complained. We were stunned. They were not ­accommodating at all.

'We asked people if they wanted us to leave. No one said they had complained so we refused to go.

'At the end he knew how upset we were but he didn’t even apologise.'

Harvester later apologised to Miss Brennan's mother, Helen, and offered her a £100 gift voucher.

But the mother-of-three vowed to never to return to a Harvester again, branding the service 'appalling'.

A spokesman for the Harvester said: 'We apologise to Megan and her family and are investigating their complaint thoroughly.'
