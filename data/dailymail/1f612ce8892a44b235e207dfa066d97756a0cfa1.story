Whether they happen in a flash, or take a little bit more building up to first kisses are usually a special moment for everyone.

But a former army clerk had to wait more than 20 years for her first kiss with her childhood sweetheart after they made a promise to ‘wish upon a star’ the night before she signed up.

As teenagers, Marie Kavanagh, 38, and Alex Inwood, 38, chose the planet Venus - the brightest point of light in the night sky - to remind themselves of each other as they went their separate ways after school.

Miss Kavanagh’s tours of duty would take
 her Bosnia, Kosovo and Cyprus and, despite going on to have another 
relationship which gave her two children, from time to time she would 
look up at the planet and think of her time with Mr Inwood.

He stayed behind in the West Midlands and also had two children but finally took the plunge when he reunited with Miss Kavanagh in August 
2013 and the pair are now, finally, a couple.

Miss
 Kavanagh, of Coventry, said: 'I don’t regret the choices I made. It was
 my lifelong dream to join the army and my path led me on to have two 
wonderful boys.

'But I’m so happy to be with Alex now. It was fate - we were meant to be together.'

Miss
 Kavanagh and Mr Inwood first became close in 1992 when they were sat on
 the same table during art lessons at Ernestford Grange Community School
 in Coventry.

Miss
 Kavanagh said: 'I thought he was hilarious. He made a paper mache mask 
based on the Pinhead character from the Hellraiser films which I thought 
was hysterical. We had exactly the same sense of humour.

'He began making excuses to catch up with me in the corridor after class and soon we were hanging out together after school.

'It
 was very innocent - we held hands, but we never kissed. I never tried 
to kiss him, and if he had tried to kiss me, I would have been oblivious
 to it.'

Miss
 Kavanagh, whose grandfather was among the British prisoners of war 
forced to build Burma’s Death Railway and whose father served in 
Operation Motorman in Northern Ireland, dreamed of joining the army once she turned 18 in 1994.

Mr Inwood 
said: 'I knew how important a career in the forces was to Marie and I 
wasn’t going to stop her fulfilling her dreams, no matter what I felt 
about her. So I made sure the moment we said goodbye was special.'

Miss
 Kavanagh said: 'Me and Alex were incredibly close by that point. We had
 instinctively begun telling each other we loved each other. But I’ve 
always been extremely proud of my family’s connection with the armed 
forces and I was going to join up no matter what.

'The
 night before I left, Alex and I went for a walk. He stood beneath a 
lamp-post and shook it until the light went out. We then looked up and 
picked out the brightest point in the sky.

'Alex
 said that wherever we might be in the world, we could look up, see 
Venus, and it would be as if we were together again. It was incredibly 
romantic.'

Miss 
Kavanagh fulfilled her dream by joining the Adjutant General’s Corps 
and, despite injuries, served in the army over a period of 12 years, 
eventually reaching the rank of Lance Corporal.

Marie served in the army over a period of 12 years, eventually reaching the rank of Lance Corporal (R) before leaving the army in 2006 and returning to the UK, settling in Leeds (left, Marie pictured recently)

In
 2005 she gave birth to twin boys, Shane and Leon, now 9. She said: 'I 
was living my life but from time to time, I would look up at Venus and find myself wondering where Alex was - what he was doing, and who he was with.'

Unknown to her, Mr Inwood had found a life in Leamington Spa, and was raising a daughter, Jo, now 12 with his then-partner.

Miss Kavanagh eventually left the army in 2006 and returned to the UK, where she settled in Leeds.

Two years later, she was glad to recieve a friend request from Mr Inwood on Facebook.She
 said: 'I was so happy to hear from him, although we were both in 
relationships at the time. We caught up briefly, and promised to stay in
 touch with each other.'

Miss
 Kavanagh’s relationship came to an end in 2010 and she turned her 
thoughts to returning to Coventry to be closer to her family. Realising 
that Mr Inwood owned a removals business, Miss Kavanagh asked him 
whether he would be willing to help her move.

The
 pair finally reunited in person in August 2013, by which time Mr Inwood
 had a son, Mason, now 2, although by then his own relationship had been
 over for nearly five months.

Miss Kavanagh, who now works as a primary school classroom assistant, said: 'We met up in the Memorial Park in Coventry and spent the whole day together. It was as if we’d never been apart. The chemistry was exactly the same.

'I didn’t want to leave him. At the end of the night, he leaned over and kissed me. It felt wonderful, after all that time.'

Just over a week later, Miss Kavanagh and her sons moved in with Mr Inwood and his children in Leamington Spa.

Today, Miss Kavanagh lives in Coventry and spends every day with her former childhood sweetheart.

Mr Inwood said: 'The road to us getting together was a long and winding one. Perhaps things could have happened differently. Perhaps I should have given Marie that kiss when we were teenagers.

'But I wouldn’t change anything - I love my kids and I know Marie loves hers too.

'The important thing is we’re back together now.'
