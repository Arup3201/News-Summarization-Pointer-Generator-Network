Warriors wearing feathered headdresses rode for 16 days from South Dakota to commemorate 38 of their ancestors hanged 150 years ago in the largest execution in US history.

Hundreds of other Native Americans joined them at their destination - a new memorial in Mankato, Minnesota - including runners who had travelled 74 miles from Fort Snelling.

The 'Dakota 38' were executed in at the end of 1862's US-Dakota war, one of the bitterest land disputes in American history.

Dakota/Lakota leader Arvol Looking Horse said the vigil marked 'a new beginning of healing'.

Originally, 303 men were sentenced to be hanged, but President Abraham Lincoln granted all but 38 a reprieve. Some Native Americans believe he was wrong to order any hangings, however, and that several of the men were 
innocent of wrongdoing.

The names of those killed have now been inscribed on the new Reconciliation Park monument, along with a poem and a prayer.

Yesterday, 60 riders, including some tribe members who rode 
for 16 days from South Dakota, were among around 500 people on hand
for the dedication of a new 'Dakota 38' memorial.

A traditional drum group sang a 
song composed for the 38 Dakota, to the pounding of a large drum.

Mankato Mayor Eric Anderson read a proclamation declaring this the year 
of 'forgiveness and understanding.'

Sad tale: Those who were spared were sent from a prison in Mankato to one in Davenport, Iowa, where many died from squalid conditions

Dakota/Lakota leader Arvol Looking Horse said: 'Today, being here to witness a great gathering, we have peace in our hearts - a new beginning of healing.'

Sidney Byrd, a Dakota/Lakota elder 
from Flandreau, S.D., read out the names of the 
38 men who were hanged in the native Dakota language, according to The Free Press of Mankato.

'I'm proud to be with you today,' he said. 'My 
great-grandfather was one of those who paid the supreme price for our 
freedom.'

Byrd's great-grandfather was among the Dakota 
originally sentenced to death who were given reprieves by Lincoln. The 
men were sent from a prison in Mankato to one in Davenport, Iowa, where 
many died from squalid conditions.

Never forget: The Dakota were almost successful in their struggle against settlers who they said had failed to pay for the indigenous people's land they had been given

The Dakota behind the new memorial and
the 'ride and run' have used the mantra 'forgive everyone everything' to 
mark the 150th anniversary. Those words will be engraved in stone 
benches to be placed around the new memorial next summer.

'This is a great day, not only for the
Dakota but for the city of Mankato,' said Bud Lawrence of Mankato, who 
helped start a reconciliation effort in the 1970s.

State Rep. Dean Urdahl, R-Grove City, 
who co-chairs a state task force commemorating the Civil War and 
US-Dakota War, said that while progress has been made through 
reconciliation and education, there remains a lack of understanding 
about what led up to the war and the problems that the Dakota suffered 
long afterward.

'Through understanding comes a healing that is still continuing today,' he said.

Richard Milda, of the Crow Agency in 
Montana, was among a small group of riders who made the entire trip from
Lower Brule, S.D., to Mankato. It is the third year he has taken part in 
the ride.

He said he 'was attracted to its message of forgiveness and remembrance.'

The 'Dakota 38' were executed at the end of the US-Dakota war (pictured right), which took place along the Minnesota River in the autumn of 1862.

The native Dakota people had ceded 24million acres of land in Minnesota to the US government in one of the most significant Indian treaties in history, signed in 1851. Such treaties were instrumental in opening the American west to European settlement.

In exchange, they were promised reservation lands and $3,075,000, to be paid over a 50-year period in annual annuities of goods and money. This came to about 12 cents an acre for some of the richest agricultural land in the country.

The treaties were later amended to weaken the position of the 7,000 Dakota, who were left with just two reservations, each 20 miles wide and about 70 miles long,

Delayed and skipped payments drove the Native Americans to increasing desperation.

In 1862, the Indians seized an opportunity, with most able-bodied US men away fighting the Civil War, and very nearly succeeded.

Before the US-Dakota Conflict  (or Sioux Uprising, as it is often called) could be brought under control, at least
450 white settlers and soldiers were killed and considerable property 
was destroyed in southern Minnesota.

There were uncounted numbers of Dakota 
casualties because of the Indian custom of removing all dead and dying 
warriors from the battlefield.

The conflict launched a series of Indian wars on the northern plains that did not end until 1890.

A five-man military commission was appointed to try the Dakota who had participated in the outbreak. The commission settled up to 40 cases in a single day. Some were heard in as little as five minutes. In all, the commission tried 392 prisoners, sentenced 307 to death and gave 16 prison terms.

President Abraham Lincoln heard there had been injustices and was urged to show compassion by Episcopalian Bishop Henry Whipple.

Lincoln reviewed the cases and then wrote a letter to Minnesota Gov. Alexander Ramsey, listing 39 men who should be hanged, including one who was later given a reprieve.

Those who were spared were sent from a prison in Mankato to one in Davenport, Iowa, where many died from squalid conditions.

Some Native Americans believe Lincoln was wrong to order any hangings at all, and that several of those found guilty were innocent of all wrongdoing.

A further 1,600 Dakota were held at a 
camp at Fort Snelling until being sent out of Minnesota, and virtually 
all others fled the state.

After the war, Minnesota's second governor, Ramsey, said the Dakota should be exterminated or driven from the state. This August, Gov. Mark Dayton marked the 150th anniversary of the start of the war by asking Minnesotans to 'remember the dark past' and by repudiating Ramsey's comments.
