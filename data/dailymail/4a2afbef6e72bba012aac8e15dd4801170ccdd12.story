Of all the bunnies in Debbie and Al Morgia's Connecticut home, Peter is by far the nosiest.

The long-eared black-and-white pet was born with a pair of snouts because of a genetic mutation.

The Morgias have a total of nine bunnies: some rescued, others purchased, and two of them handicapped.

Peter, the adorable two-nosed critter, is the family favorite. 

Two noses are better than one: One of Debbie Morgia's nine bunnies, Peter, rests on the shoulder of Debbie Morgia in Milford, Connecticut. Peter has two noses as the result of a genetic mutation

Fluffy menagerie: Al and Debbie Morgia have a total of nine bunnies, including one whose had is permanently titled to one side 

The small furry animal had been the mascot of a local pet store until the business shut its doors and the Morgias took him in.

According to Debbie Morgia, someone had once offered the pet store $5,000 for Peter because of his unique look, but the owner refused to sell him.

One of Peter's two noses does not fulfill a respiratory function and is there just for show. 

Mrs Morgia says that at first, the funny-looking pet mascot had a prickly demeanor, but he now loves to be cuddled and kissed.

'He's just come so far,' she tells the New Haven Register.

Peter shares a cage with his furry pals Spritz, Cocoa and Harley. The family are also raising Chowder, Smokey, Mustang, Patches and Mocha, whose head is permanently tilted to one side because of a parasite.
