A mother-of-three drowned after she was dragged out to sea away from her husband's grasp as he tried to save her in the Canary Isles.

Nikki Bate went for a swim off the shore of Famara Beach, near the resort of Caleta de Famara in Lanzarote, but was swept out into big seas moments after warning her family not to enter the water.

She screamed for help and her husband Anthony Bate, 56, dived in to try to rescue her. He managed to grab her, but the strong riptide pulled them apart.

Desperately trying to help her he watched as his wife panicked and drowned in front of him.

The tragedy happened after Mrs Bate had warned her two sons that the water was too dangerous after they wanted to go body-boarding.

After arriving back in the UK, Mr bate, of Barrow, Lancashire, said: 'We spent a few hours paddling in the surf then she said "in five minutes we're going home".

'She went for a swim. But unfortunately it's one of the most dangerous beaches in the Canaries. My daughter India said she was shouting for help so then I swam out and reached her.

'The sea was terrible. It was shocking. I've never seen anything like it.

'We were being bashed about and we got separated. She panicked and drowned. It was a little mistake with calamitous consequences and this is the tragedy we're left with.

He added: 'We are all devastated but we are being strong.'

The family had been staying at their holiday home on the island before the tragic accident last Thursday afternoon.

Anthony, a company director, said lifeguards got to the couple within a few minutes, pulled them both back to the beach and battled for at least half an hour to save Nikki.

Anthony praised the lifeguards for their efforts. He said: 'They tried tirelessly to revive my wife and were very sensitive, as were the police and ambulance staff.'

He described his wife of 16 years as a wonderful and dedicated mother and said himself and his children India, 14, Nathaniel, 12, and Cameron, 10, will all miss her very much.

Anthony met Nikki 20 years ago at the Asda store in Accrington and bonded over their mutual vegetarianism.

Nikki, who is originally from Whalley, was a housewife who also volunteered for the Home-Start charity, offering friendship and practical help with families with young children in East Lancashire.

She also used to own The Crown Wheel restaurant in King Street, Whalley, which is now the Italian restaurant Amico Mio.

The family received consular assistance from the Foreign Office and arrived back in the UK at around 12am on Sunday.

The strong currents at Famara Beach have already claimed the life of one Briton - in a tragedy last April.

In a chilling echo of Nikki Bate's death, Steve Potter lost his life at the same resort after getting into difficulties while out swimming in April this year.

The 43-year-old was dragged from the water unconscious and could not be revived.

An ex-patriate, who visited the resort recently, has also described the inherent dangers of the two-mile stretch of beach, a favourite among surfers and kiteboarders.

Julie Cliffe-Jones, said: 'Playa de Famara is a stunning beach but a dangerous one.

'We visited this beach on Wednesday with a family who were here on holiday and we couldn't stress the importance enough of staying within standing depth.

'This is not a beach for swimming off, only for paddle or surfing as it's renowned for it's rip-tide.'

She also said that while there are red flags constantly flying on the beach, warning of dangerous waters, there was only one lifeguard station for the area.
