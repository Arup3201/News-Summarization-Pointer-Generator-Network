Maintaining defence spending at the minimum demanded by Nato is now only a 'target', top Tory cabinet minister Philip Hammond suggested this morning.

The Foreign Secretary refused 10 times to guarantee that the Tories would protect the military from further cuts after the election.

Mr Hammond said the final decision on whether or not to ring-fence military spending would not be made until after the election.

The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond refused 10 times to guarantee that the Tories would protect the military from further cuts after the election

The government has guaranteed defence spending will stay above 2 per cent of Britain's national income until 2016 – but not beyond.

The failure to protect military spending – while guaranteeing cash for foreign aid – has sparked fury on the Tory backbenches.

Up to 30 Conservative MPs are thought to be backing a bid by John Baron, MP for Basildon and Billericay, to force a protest vote against defence cuts in the Commons this week.

MPs claim that if the Chancellor George Osborne gets his way Britain's military spending will fall below 2 per cent of GDP – despite the Prime Minister using a Nato summit in Wales to publicly shame other countries into hitting that target.

Mr Cameron fears it will damage relations with US President Barack Obama, who urged him last month not to set a bad example to other Nato nations by cutting spending.

Military top brass fear the Treasury will raid another £1billion a year from MoD coffers to try to balance the nation's books.

Mr Hammond said the Government would not set out its defence spending plans until after the next election at 'the beginning of the next parliament'

Military spending will stay above 2 per cent of GDP until 2015/16.

David Cameron has pledge an annual 1 per cent real terms increase in spending on defence equipment after the election.

The Prime Minister has also pledged not to cut the size of the army below the level it is now. 

He also remains committed to growing the Army Reserves to 35,000.

But defence spending in the UK is forecast to drop to 1.7 per cent by 2020

Defence spending in the UK is forecast to drop to 1.7 per cent by 2020, even without further cuts.

Mr Hammond, speaking this morning on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, was asked if Britain could afford to cut defence spending with the growing threat posed by Vladimir Putin and ISIS in the Middle East.

It came after he admitted Britain's relations with Russia could be 'prickly' for many years - and described the country as an 'adversary'.

He said it was clear Britain was 'not going to fight the Russians in Ukraine', but insisted there was a 'hard red line' protecting Nato's Baltic members from Russian incursions.

Mr Hammond added: 'We're the second largest defence spender in NATO, we've got a huge equipment programme modernising our armed forces.'

'We led the charge encouraging our NATO partners to make this commitment. Many of them are far, far away from two per cent.'

But he said the Government would not set out its defence spending plans until after the next election at 'the beginning of the next parliament'.

He said: 'There are two things I can't do today. I can't tell you what will be in the Conservative manifesto but you'll find out soon enough, and I can't prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election.

'But David Cameron led the charge on the NATO two per cent commitment at the summit in Wales last year.

'He is passionate about our armed forces, he has always been absolutely clear that he is not prepared to preside over any further cuts in our regular armed forces. So he knows where he wants to go.

'But we've got very difficult decisions to make in delivering our long-term economic plan to get Britain out of deficit and staring to pay down instead.

'We've got to make those difficult balanced decisions, but we will protect the integrity and the strength of our armed forces.'

Andrew Marr tried 10 times to get the Foreign Secretary to guarantee military spending

Andrew Marr: ‘We have Russian submarines testing our waters and Russian jets buzzing our airspace, and at the same time we are not committing ourselves to maintaining the NATO minimum defence spending. Where do you stand on that?’

Philip Hammond: ‘Well, clearly I was defence secretary for nearly three years, I’m a passionate supporter of the armed forces and of maintaining Britain’s military strength. And we are spending two per cent of our GDP.’

Marr: ‘You’re not committing the party to doing that at the next election.’

Hammond: ‘Well, we’re the second largest defence spender in NATO, we’ve got a huge equipment programme modernising our armed forces.

‘We’re building the two largest aircraft carriers the Royal Navy has ever had. We’re equipping them with the world’s most advanced fighter aircraft, we’re launching a submarine.’

Marr: ‘But you don’t commit to two per cent going ahead.’

Hammond: ‘Well, we led the charge at the NATO summit.’

Marr: ‘We’re going to look damn silly if we don’t do it ourselves.’

Hammond: ‘We led the charge encouraging our NATO partners to make this commitment. Many of them are far, far away from two per cent.’

Marr: ‘So we want it too then don’t we?’

Hammond: ‘We will have a strategic defence and security review at the beginning of the next parliament and a spending review and we will set out our future plans then. But we are committed to the two per cent target.’

Marr: ‘Through the course of the next parliament?’

Hammond: ‘We will set out the defence spending.’

Marr: ‘I’m sorry, but a lot of people want to know whether the country can trust the Conservatives over defence and the two per cent target is crucial to this.

‘There’s an argument going on about it, we all understand that, inside the Cabinet. As Foreign Secretary surely you can commit yourself personally to the two per cent.

Hammond: ‘There are two things I can’t do today. I can’t tell you what will be in the Conservative manifesto but you’ll find out soon enough, and I can’t prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election.’

Marr: ‘Can you at least therefore…’

Hammond: ‘David Cameron led the charge on the NATO two per cent commitment at the summit in Wales last year.’

Marr: ‘And therefore you could at least commit yourself to agreeing with David Davis that he would look pretty damn silly if he didn’t then commit himself to two per cent for this country?’

Hammond: ‘Look, I worked closely with the prime minister on this subject when I was defence secretary for three years. He is passionate about our armed forces, he has always been absolutely clear that he is not prepared to preside over any further cuts in our regular armed forces. So he knows where he wants to go.

‘But we’ve got very difficult decisions to make in delivering our long-term economic plan to get Britain out of deficit and staring to pay down instead. We’ve got to make those difficult balanced decisions, but we will protect the integrity and the strength of our armed forces.’

Marr: ‘So no cuts to the British army – no further cuts to the British army. No ifs, no buts, that’s an absolutely clear policy?’

Hammond: ‘The prime minister has been very clear that he is not prepared to see further cuts in the size of the regular armed forces.’
