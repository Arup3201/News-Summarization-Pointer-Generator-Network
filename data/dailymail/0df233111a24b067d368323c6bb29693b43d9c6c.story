TV regulator Ofcom has said it will investigate Channel 4 series Benefits Street to see whether it broke broadcasting guidelines following nearly 1,800 complaints.

The documentary series sparked hundreds of complaints after featuring a thief showing how to shoplift.

Other residents were revealed to be benefit cheats while a 15-year-old child bride was also featured on the show filmed in James Turner Street, Birmingham.

Ofcom will examine whether the programme may have caused offence by being misleading or unfair, and whether enough was done to protect under-18s in the show, as well as the way it depicted possible crimes.

Complaints: The five-part series Benefits Street attracted around 1,800 complaints to Ofcom - but was a huge ratings success for Channel 4

Benefit fraud: Mark and Becky, who live on James Turner Street, told programme makers they had their benefits stopped because of fraud

Child bride: Romanian husband Stefan Stana was filmed in episode two admitting he had married his wife, thought to be called Madalina Balasa, when she was 15

The documentary series was supposed to portray the daily lives of people living in the road - many of whom are living off handouts.

The watchdog was deluged with calls, letters and emails from viewers of the five-part documentary series.

However, Ofcom said they would not look into the complaints until the end of the run, which finished last week.

In the first episode, prolific shoplifter Danny Smith was shown explaining how to dodge security alarms and remove security tags from designer clothes without causing damage.

Young couple Mark and Becky who live on the street told the film-makers they had all their benefits stopped because of fraudulent claims.

And in the second episode, Romanian husband Stefan Stana was show admitting that his wife had married him when she was 15.

Only a few months later,  the 
teenager, thought to be called Madalina Balasa,  gave birth to a baby 
girl in a Birmingham hospital.

The series generated around 960 complaints to Ofcom and another 800 to Channel 4.

Benefits Street is the channel’s biggest ratings hit since its coverage of the Paralympics in 2012.

Channel 4 and programme makers Love Productions claim the street is typical of hundreds of UK communities struggling to cope with economic and social decline.

But some critics labelled it ‘poverty porn’ and said it is paints a false picture of life in modern Britain.

Others praised it for exposing the truth of benefits fraud but said it failed to condemn crime and also exploits children, exposing them to bullying and victimisations.

Some residents said the show - which shows children swearing and misbehaving - has left youngsters to ashamed and embarrassed to go to school.

An Ofcom spokeswoman said: 'Following the conclusion of Benefits Street, Ofcom can confirm that it has launched an investigation into the series.'

A spokesman for Channel 4 said: 'We are confident there has been no breach of the Ofcom code and will be providing a detailed and robust response to the investigation.'
