Organic kitty litter was partially to blame for a multimillion-dollar radiation leak at an underground
nuclear waste dump in New Mexico, scientists revealed this week.  

The US Energy Department report on last year's accident at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad
showed that a drum of waste containing radioisotopes like
plutonium was improperly packaged at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory near Santa Fe before arriving for disposal.

The improper mix in the barrel, including the wrong sort of
kitty litter used to absorb liquids, sparked a chemical reaction
causing it to heat up and generate gases that dislodged its lid,
spewing radioactive materials, investigators found.

This barrel at the Waste Isolation Pilot Project near Carlsbad, New Mexico, ruptured a year ago, resulting in radioactive contamination that shut down WIPP indefinitely 

Culprit: The waste drum contained 'chemically incompatible' materials, including Swheat Scoop brand of organic kitty litter 

Health scare: The accident at WIPP exposed 22 workers to radiation in amounts not expected to threaten their health

The radiation leak that began in the WIPP disposal chamber
half a mile below ground February 14, 2014, 'did not result from
a detonation,' the 277-page report released Thursday concluded. 

The accident exposed 22 workers to radiation in amounts not
expected to threaten their health, according to Nuclear Waste
Partnership LLC, the contractor that operates the facility.

The accident indefinitely suspended key operations at the
site, the Energy Department's only permanent underground
repository for certain types of radiological waste tied to US nuclear labs and weapons sites.

In September, Energy Department officials estimated the cost
of the initial recovery of the dump at $240million and said it
might be two years or more before it is fully operational again. 

'I cannot say how high a priority it is to get WIPP reopened and operating. In general terms, it is critical for everything we do in geologic disposal of nuclear materials,' Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said at a Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee hearing earlier this week. 

The report confirms the agency's preliminary theories about the cause of the costly mishap and also clarified that just one barrel of waste containing 'chemically incompatible' materials - including Swheat Scoop brand litter, nitrate salts and a neutralizing agent - from Los Alamos was to blame.

New Mexico slapped the Energy Department with $54million in
fines in December for violations of state hazardous waste
permits tied to WIPP and the Los Alamos lab.

Also last year, a team of federal inspectors released a
report that cited chronic lapses in safety procedures at Los
Alamos that contributed to the radiation leak.

The lab's 'waste processing and safety-related control
procedures should have prevented the addition of these
potentially incompatible materials,' the inspectors said of the
ruptured waste barrel.
