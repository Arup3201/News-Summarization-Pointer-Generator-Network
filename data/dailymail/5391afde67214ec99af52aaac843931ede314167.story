A young boy has raised more than £40,000 for 'Movember'  - despite being unable to grow facial hair.

Each year November heralds the annual challenge as men across the world grow moustaches for charity to raise awareness of male cancers.

But determined to honour his granddad who died of cancer, William Heath,  from Earls Barton in Northamptonshire, refused to be left out.

And so the creative 12-year-old dressed up as a different moustached character each day.

From Ron Burgundy of Anchorman fame, to wrestler Hulk Hogan, and comic character, Borat, William stayed in costume for as long as was possible each day.

He decided to take on the challenge in memory of his granddad, who died from pancreatic cancer in February.

He is now the eighth biggest fundraiser out of more than 135,000 males who've taken on the Movember challenge this year.

William Heath, 12, from Northamptonshire has dressed up as famous moustached characters throughout November to raise money for the Movember campaign. He is pictured imitating Will Ferrell's Ron Burgundy character made famous by the Anchorman films

Though as a 12-year-old William is unable to grow facial hair, he was determined to raise money for the campaign in honour of his granddad Robin Wickham, left, who died of pancreatic cancer in February

He is currently the 8th biggest fundraiser out of more than 135,000 men who have taken part in the Movember challenge this year. For one of his challenges he dressed up as the wrestler Hulk Hogan

William's mother, Clare Heath, 43, told MailOnline: 'William and his Pappa were really close and William wanted to do something positive in his memory.

'He's too young to run a marathon or climb Kilimanjaro, so as Movember approached we both knew it might be perfect.

'William and his Pappa loved going to see Northampton Saints play rugby together, which every November has a big 'Front Mo Union' campaign, so there was that angle too.'

The obvious problem was that William can't grow facial hair, but one day towards the end of October he and his mother were in a local pound shop where William picked up a stick-on moustache, and the idea was born.

As a family they expanded the fake moustache concept to William dressing up as a different famous character each day in November, from Ron Burgundy to Magnum PI to Ali G.

William's 12th birthday was on November 1, so he and his mother posted photos of William in his different outfits, asking friends and family to make a donation towards his Movember campaign, rather than buy him a present.

'They were way more popular than we could have ever imagined, and soon we were getting requests from people all over the world for William to dress up as specific characters,' Ms Heath said.

'Dylan Hartley, who captains the Front Mo Union, regularly sends supporting tweets, Keith Lemon is re-tweeting us, not to mention hundreds of complete strangers from around the world who've been so incredibly generous.

William's granddad, Robin Wickham, had previously survived having both testicular and prostate cancer, but was diagnosed with aggressive pancreatic cancer on Christmas Eve. He died on February 7, aged 71

'If you'd asked me at the start of the month what we might achieve I'd have said a few smiles and £200 – it's spiralled into such a fantastic success story, and William is so proud. 

'We've got pledges to take us over the £5,000 mark now, and by the end of Sunday we could have even more than that.'

As well as being eighth overall, William is the number one fundraising student for Movember, the Front Mo Union, the Premiership Rugby Network and the UK Rugby Network.

William's granddad, Robin Wickham, had previously survived having both testicular and prostate cancer, but was diagnosed with aggressive pancreatic cancer on Christmas Eve. He died on  February 7, aged 71.

'My dad was such a fun-loving man, and all his nine grandchildren loved him to bits,' Ms Heath said.

'He was the embarrassing dad on the dance floor at parties, always poking fun at life, and he'd have loved to been here to help William dress up. There couldn't be a more fitting tribute.'

Miss Heath said another obstacle to William taking part in the challenge was his Asperger's.

'He's sensitive to textures and smells, so dressing in different costumes was a particular challenge for him,' Ms Heath said.

'He was often simply overwhelmed and has regularly had to have a word with himself to soldier on, reminding himself what he's doing this for.

William told MailOnline: 'My granddad and I were very close. I know he'd giggle if he could see me in all these silly costumes'

'Sometimes he's told me he can't carry on, but every morning he pulls himself together and puts on another outfit.'

Every morning William's older sister Isobel, 13, has helped him get changed and takes the photographs, which are then uploaded onto Facebook, Twitter and his 'Mo' space.

William told MailOnline: 'My granddad and I were very close. He used to come on holiday with us and was always having fun, cracking jokes and making me laugh.

'I know he'd giggle if he could see me in all these silly costumes – I've made them from things I've found at home and also bits I've picked up from the fancy dress shop near us.

'My favourite so far has been Ali G, but Ned Flanders was hard – I tried painting my face yellow, but it didn't work.'

Ms Heath added: 'We needed to fill 30 days. When you try to think of 30 people with moustaches it is harder than you think.

'The overriding thing is that it has been fun, but it has serious implications. We're already trying to come up with something similarly entertaining and engaging for next year's campaign.'
