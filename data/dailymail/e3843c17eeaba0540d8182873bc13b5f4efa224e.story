Guilty: Shahin Hashemi-Haeri has been given a curfew after admitting a foul-mouthed and racist attack on bouncers at an exclusive Mayfair club

A property manager has been given an all night curfew and told to wear an electronic tag after a drunken row with door staff at an exclusive Mayfair club during which he kicked a bouncer, smashed windows and racially abused staff.

Doormen asked Shahin Hashemi-Haeri, 45, to leave the Home House club in Portman Square at around 2am in October last year for being too drunk, a court heard today.

But he refused to leave the £1,840-a-year members' club, which has been visited by celebrities including Cheryl Cole, Noel Gallagher and Myleene Klass, shouting 'I'm not leaving you black motherf*****'.

After being escorted out, prosecutor Darren Watts told Westminister magistrates court that Hashemi-Haeri, the director of a property management company, later returned and started kicking at the doors.

'He then kicked at the window on the left of the door and continued doing so until it smashed,' Mr Watts said.

'He did the same to the window on the right of the door.

'When the complainant opened the door he saw the defendant walking away.

'When he asked him why he broke the glass he replied "I don't give a f***".

'The defendant then kicked him in the shin, causing pain and discomfort.

'The complainant then restrained the 
defendant, fearing he would be assaulted again, and the defendant 
shouted, "get off me you black motherf***er".'

The Home House club, which stretches over three Georgian town houses, is in one of London's most expensive postcodes W1.

A description on the venue's website claims it is 'London's most exclusive private members’ club'.

It also says: 'For members, the best bit is probably that there are no stuffy rules - in fact there really aren't any rules at all. Well, just one: "Nudity is discouraged". Naughtiness, on the other hand, is de rigueur.'

Hashemi-Haeri, who had been a member of the club for nine years, pleaded guilty to criminal damage, common assault and two charges of racial harassment.

His lawyer described him as 'a professional man who pays his way in society'.

District Judge Michael Fanning spared him a jail sentence because he believed he is 'unlikely to repeat the offences'.

But he imposed a six-month curfew meaning Hashemi-Haeri, of Surrey Quays, south London, must stay indoors between 8pm to 7am for the next six months.

He will also have to wear an electronic tag to ensure he doesn't violate the punishment.

'I really do find the racially aggravating element in this case deeply unpleasant and deeply offensive' said the District Judge.

'This sort of thing cannot go on. Modern Britain is supposed to be a diverse country, welcoming everyone regardless of their colour, creed or race, and that's why cases of this kind must be marked by the courts.

'To mark the court's displeasure, and society's displeasure, the least sentence I can provide is a community order.'
