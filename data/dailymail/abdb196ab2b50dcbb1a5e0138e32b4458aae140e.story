They are the backbone of church fetes, village fairs and jumble sales all around the country.

But the thousands who regularly sell their home-made jam, marmalade or chutney in re-used jars may have to abandon their traditions after a warning that they are breaching European health and safety regulations.

Legal advisers to Britain’s Churches have sent out a circular saying that while people can use jars for jam at home or to give to family and friends, they cannot sell them or even give them away as raffle prizes at a public event.

Glass warfare: The Women's Institute is warning its 210,000 members about the European regulations

Take note: The written circular from the Churches' Legislation Advisory Service

The circular from the Churches’ 
Legislation Advisory Service, which is chaired by the Bishop of Exeter, 
is pointedly headed: ‘Please take note: this looks like a spoof but it’s
 not.’

The advisers say the
 rules that are being breached are the snappily-titled EC Regulations 
1935/2004 and 2023/2006, which prevent containers being re-used unless 
they are specifically designed for that purpose.

The
 Women’s Institute said it was offering similar advice on the re-use of 
jam jars to its 210,000 members. A spokesman said the news could send ‘a
 tremor through middle-England’ and the organisation was braced for a 
flurry of inquiries.

The 
Food Standards Agency said the rules had been introduced because there 
was a risk of chemicals leaching out of old containers and contaminating
 food, though it added that  it was not aware that  re-used jam jars 
were a safety hazard.

'Daft': The news will alarm a growing number of jam-makers

The agency said it was up to local authority environmental health officers to enforce the regulations, and penalties can reach a maximum of a £5,000  fine, six months’ imprisonment, or both.

The news will alarm the growing number of jam-makers inspired by model Kate Moss, who makes damson jam out of fruit from her Cotswolds estate, and the Duchess of Cambridge, who keeps pots to give away  to friends.

Mary Berry, the star of the BBC’s The Great British Bake Off, said: ‘This is absolutely stupid. It is just going too far.

‘We
 are encouraging people to save money by using fruits  to make chutneys 
and jam, and if they have to buy new jars it will become much too 
expensive. It’s daft.’

The rules are also causing 
consternation in churches that rely on the hundreds of thousands of 
pounds raised from fetes and bazaars.

The Rev Derek  Williams, a spokesman 
for the diocese of Peterborough, said enforcing the rule ‘would be a 
blow to fundraising events for all sorts of voluntary organisations’.

He added: ‘It’s quite ridiculous, as 
selling home-made jams and chutneys has always been a traditional and 
important part of fundraising for church groups and others.

‘Older people in particular, or those not terribly well-off, have never been shy of making a few pots and giving that away.

‘People will offer their home-made jam when perhaps they can’t give anything else.’

'This is not a spoof': Church advisers forced to point out 'stupid' rule to members

Mr
 Williams said he had never heard of anyone falling ill from eating jam 
from a re-used jar, adding: ‘There must be a sensible balance between 
health and safety and something that has happened without incident for 
centuries.’

Canon Michael 
Tristran, of Portsmouth Cathedral, said: ‘On realising this was not a 
belated April Fool’s joke, I was very anxious, not only from the 
fundraising point of view for all our churches, but also because it goes
 against the green agenda of recycling.’

The WI said anyone using old jars should sterilise them by washing them and drying them in an oven on a low heat.
