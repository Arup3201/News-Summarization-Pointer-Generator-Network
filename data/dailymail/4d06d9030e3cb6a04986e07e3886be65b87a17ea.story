She's famous for her frugal approach 
to household management and is said to use Tupperware boxes to help keep
food waste at Buckingham Palace to a minimum.

And
it would seem the Queen's thrifty instinct isn't confined to the 
kitchen after she made a third public appearance in a favourite cerise 
and black ensemble she wore twice during last year's Jubilee 
celebrations.

The 
monarch wore the Angela Kelly designed pink cashmere coat and dress 
during today's visit to the East Sussex town of Lewes, where she and the
Duke of Edinburgh visited the Youth Hostel Association before 
continuing to the seaside town of Newhaven.

Downs to look at their new facilities - including 'glamping' pods

MARCH 2012 Left, The Queen wore the pink outfit on 8 March last year when she spent the day with Kate in Leicester

MAY 2012 The outfit came out again 2012 when she attended a Mad Hatters tea party in Sherbourne, Dorset

The outfit first appeared in March 2012 when she wore the ensemble on a visit to Leicester with the Duchess of Cambridge.

Two months later, the ensemble reappeared during a Diamond Jubilee visit to a Mad Hatter's tea party in Sherbourne.

This
time around, the Queen wore the outfit to tour a fish market, where she
and the Duke of Edinburgh saw more than 40 varieties of fish caught off
the Sussex coast.

Crab, 
lobsters, monk fish, conger eel and squid were all displayed on ice for 
the Queen and Philip to inspect at the family-run fish company.

Shop
manager Kerry Bickerstaff, 37, who has worked at the firm for 20 years,
said: 'It’s an honour. We had the Duke of Kent about 10 years ago but I
have never met the Queen before. It’s great news for the community to 
have her here.'

Big moment: Abigail Venter, aged four, looked delighted as she curtseyed to the Queen in Lewes

Looking good: Both the Queen and the Duke appeared to be in good spirits as they made their appearance

The local community has been 
mourning the loss this week of 14-year-old Dylan Alkins who was swept 
out to sea while playing in the surf at Newhaven on Sunday afternoon.

Among
the guests at the fish market to meet the Queen and Philip were 
coastguards and RNLI crew involved in the attempt to rescue Dylan amid 
atrocious weather conditions as the St Jude storm swept in.

Despite
extensive efforts to find him, Dylan’s body has not been recovered, 
devastating his parents who have described him as an 'amazing boy'.

Ian
Bickerstaff, 59, the owner of the fish firm, said he was enormously 
proud to welcome the Queen and Philip, but said the loss of Dylan had 
placed a cloud over the town.

He said: 'It’s a privilege for me and my girls, as it’s a family-run business, and it’s our 40th year next year.

'The only sad thing is there is a cloud over the town with the loss of the young boy this week. We all send our condolences to his family because he’s the same age as my own son.'

The Queen and Philip later visited Harvey’s Brewery in the centre of Lewes, the East Sussex county town.

It
is Sussex’s oldest independent brewery, dating back more than 200 
years, and it has won a loyal following among ale devotees, including 
Piers Morgan, a long-time resident of nearby Newick.

Accompanied
by chairman Hamish Elder and head brewer Miles Jenner, the royal couple
were shown the traditional brewing process from start to finish.

In
the brewery tower, the Queen was invited to press the button on a 
machine to start 'the mashing process', involving mixing malted barley 
and spring water to produce sugars.

Mr
Elder said afterwards: 'The Duke was extremely knowledgeable about the 
process. I was astounded by the complexity of his questions. He really 
knew his stuff.'

Applause: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were greeted by cheering crowds as they arrived in Newhaven

The
Queen and Philip continued their tour of the facilities, moving on to 
the bottling plant where bottles of Harvey’s Elizabethan Ale were being 
labelled and placed in crates.

The
7.5% ale was originally brewed to mark the Queen’s Coronation in 1953, 
and it won silver in a category at the British Bottler’s Institute 
Awards this year.

Shop 
assistant Matthew Reed, 23, spoke of his excitement at coming face to 
face with royalty. He said: 'It’s not every day that the Queen comes to 
town. It’s a real honour to see her and her husband.'

Lunch
for the royal couple was served at Harvey’s which laid on a selection 
of ales and wines from across Sussex, including from the respected 
Ridgeview and Nutbourne vineyards.

On
the menu was fish from Newhaven, which they visited earlier. Mr Elder 
said: 'It’s a hugely proud moment to have them here at Harvey’s. I can’t
compare it to anything else.'

Faux pas: Shop manager Kerry Bickerstaff appeared to touch the Queen as she escorted her inside

Knowledgeable: According to Newhaven locals, Prince Phillip knows his stuff about brewing
