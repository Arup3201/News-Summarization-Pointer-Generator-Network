Rapper and reality TV star Joe Budden has been accused of viciously beating up his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage outside of a New York restaurant earlier this week, but he has denied these claims.

According to police, the 33-year-old Pump It Up singer forced the 25-year-old woman into his car near the corner of Nagle Avenue and Dyckman Street in Queens at around 4.30am Monday and then smashed her head into the dashboard.

Budden then allegedly drove the woman to his home in New Jersey, where he proceeded to punch and kick her.

Did he do it? Rapper Joe Budden has been accused of viciously beating up his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage 

A source close to the woman told the website MediaTakeOut that Budden ‘choked her to the point she thought he was going to kill her…. She said the look on his face was dreadful like he had no soul.’

The rapper also allegedly snatched the victim’s cell phone before the attack.

TMZ has obtained graphic photos allegedly showing the aftermath of the beating.

Career trajectory: Budden is a member of the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew and a star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop 

The snapshots depict the victim's legs and arms covered in black and blue bruises, as well as red marks on her neck and the back of the head.

New York Post's Page Six reported the star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop flew into a rage after seeing photos of his former paramour on Instagram hanging out with other men in a club.

The friend who spoke to MediaTakeOut revealed that the 25-year-old bartender broke up with Budden last Sunday amid rumors of infidelity.

The rapper has responded to the scandal through his attorney, Nima Ameri, who said in a statement to TMZ that his client 'looks forward to an opportunity to responsibly deal with and address the allegations so he may establish the actual facts.'

The lawyer added that the reality TV star is cooperating with the investigation. As of Saturday afternoon, Budden has not been arrested.

Under guard: The 33-year-old shared this image on Instagram of himself surrounded by a trio of massive dogs, writing in the caption that he was guarded, 'literally' 

Hearsay: According to the victim's friend, the woman had her head smashed on a dashboard, kicked, punched and choked by Budden, who flew into a rage after seeing her spending time with other men                                      

What he said: Budden took to Twitter in response to the allegations of domestic violence 

Law and order: Budden revealed that police acting on a tip from his former lover searched his home looking for weapons 

Flippant: Budden sounded dismissive in some of his tweets, including this one alluding to his ex-girlfriend's profession  

On Twitter, Budden was far less diplomatic about the situation, writing Thursday: 'Messy break ups are so.. Well..... Messy.'

Wanted: NYPD tweeted Budden's photo asking the public for help in finding him 

In a series of expletive-laden, often flippant tweets, the member of the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew responded to his ex-girlfriend’s claims head-on.

'I don’t take this lightly, but I do find it funny seeing as how IM THE CALMEST N**** IN THE WORLD !! Smh' he wrote Friday.

He then added: 'Also, if I did half of what's alleged, a pic of her face would be out, not her leg.. This is simple logic here.'

Budden followed up with another message saying: 'I'll have my day in court... f*** it.'

Also on Friday, the rapper shared with his followers that police officers searched his New Jersey home because his ex-girlfriend allegedly told them that he was in possession of firearms.

‘The lesson to be learned here is.. Leave the strippers & bartenders in the strip club… sounds so simple!’ he concluded.

Early Saturday morning, Budden was again tweeting and posting photographs on Instagram from a strip club.

This afternoon, Budden directed his ire at the New York Police Department via Twitter after it sent out his picture and asked the public for help tracking him down.

In one expletive-punctuated tweet, the 33-year-old city native says he's going to sue.

In another, he tells the NYPD's account to alert the 'Man hunt' that he'll be at an Astoria strip club tonight.

Tirade: Budden ranted at NYPD, threatening to sue the law enforcement agency for releasing his photo on Twitter. He then tweeted at police telling them he will be in a strip club in Astoria tonight
