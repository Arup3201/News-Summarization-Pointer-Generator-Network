Early humans are widely regarded as having been voracious hunters whose appetite for meat contributed to the extinction of many of the large mammals that once roamed the planet.

However, new research by paleontologists has suggested that our human ancestors may have started out as scavengers rather than the efficient killing machines they are often portrayed as.

The findings could help to explain how early humans made the significant shift in their diet to consume meat and became one of the top predators on the planet.

Homo erectus, pictured in the reconstruction above, needed around 2200 calories a day to survive and could have easily obtained this by scavenging meat left on the carcasses by predatory big cats in Africa at the time

Dr Briana Pobiner, a palaeoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, studied the meat left behind on modern lion kills to estimate whether early humans could have sustained themselves by picking the bones left behind by predators.

She estimates that early humans like Homo erectus could have obtained enough meat to provide an entire days worth of energy from the scraps left behind by prehistoric predators.

She told Mail Online: 'Early humans would have scavenged carcasses of animals that ranged in size from medium sized animals like wildebeest all the way up to huge extinct elephants, and animals that lived in a range of different habitats from more open grasslands to closed woodlands. 

'Probably anything that wasn’t too rotten was fair game.'

Lions, like the two eating a zebra kill above, leave large amounts of their kills untouched, meaning there would have been plenty of meat for early humans to scavenge from carcasses left by prehistoric feline predators

She added that early humans probably survived though a combination of both hunting and scavenging.

She said: 'I think it was both – probably a combination of scavenging from larger animals and hunting smaller animals.

'One major energetic advantage of scavenging is that you have a really high success rate in the sense that unless a carcass is absolutely picked clean, like what happens after vultures have gotten to it, you’re virtually guaranteed to get some meat and marrow from what’s left. 

'With hunting, you can expend a lot of energy and come up empty-handed.'

Dr Pobiner found that modern predators leave large amounts of meat on their kills (as shown above) and believes that prehistoric carnivores could have left even more to be  picked clean by early humans

Speaking in a video on the Smithsonian website, she added: 'I've found in some of the fossils I studied that early humans got to these carcasses first and were able to eat the best parts of the animals.

'Sometimes carnivores got their first and early humans probably only got scraps. It has really big implications for a lot of other major changes that happened in human evolutionary history.

'The evolution in meat eating has been linked to an increase in brain size, its been linked to an increase in home range size and maybe the expansion out of Africa.

'Competing with big carnivores you needed sophisticated interaction, communication and other social skills that are another hallmark of being human.'

In research published in the Journal of Human Evolution, Dr Pobiner examined the carcasses of carnivore kills on the modern African savanna in Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy.

She looked at how much meat was consumed by lions and leopards before measuring what was left for scavengers.

She also watched how much meat other large meat eaters like hyenas and jackals left behind once they were finished with a carcass.

Dr Briana Pobiner (above) claims to have found evidence that humans butchered carcasses after large predators had eaten meat from the bones first

Speaking to Popular Archaeology she said: 'The site is a great analogue for the kinds of African savanna environments where hominins are thought to have lived.

'This may have been very much like past carnivore communities during the time our ancestors were starting to eat meat from larger animals, when we have evidence that felids — ancient lions, leopards, and three species of sabertoothed cats — lived alongside our ancestors and may have been the dominant kinds of carnivores at this time.'

Dr Pobiner found that in modern Africa even a 'defleshed' wildebeest hindlimb killed by a lion could still yield around one kilogram of meat while a zebra hind limb could have two kilograms of flesh still left on it.

She estimates that an entire wildebeest or zebra carcass could yield 5kg and 15 kg of meat respectively even after a predator had eaten.

This means a wildebeest carcass could provide 2200 calories and a zebra carcass could provide 6080 calories - enough for a small family of Homo erectus.

Dr Pobiner said: 'This is enough for the entire daily caloric requirements of at least one Homo erectus/ergaster male, estimated to require approximately 2090-2290 calories per day.'

Dr Pobiner says there is also evidence within the fossil record that suggests predators had eaten carcasses before early humans arrived to butcher the animals.

Hyenas are the main scavengers of lion kills on the African Savannah but there are few examples of them in the fossil record in areas where  early humans have been discovered and they could have scavenged instead

55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve

15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon

8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge

5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early ‘proto-human’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas

4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's 

2.7 million years ago - Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing 

2.8 million years ago - The first species in the Homo family appeared

2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis first thought to have appeared in Africa

1.9 million years ago - Homo erectus begins to appear in fossil record

1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation

800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly

400,000 years ago - Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia

200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa 

40,0000 years ago - Modern humans reach Europe 

She said that at around the time Homo erectus were alive there were also few species of bone-crunching carnivores like hyenas in Africa.

It means that early humans could have instead filled this niche. 

She said: 'This lack of bone-crunching hyenids would have meant that as early Homo individuals began incorporating more carcass foods into their diets they would have had more access to within-bone resources than is available in many present-day African savanna ecosystems.'

She added that sabretooth cats that lived at the time would have been less efficient than modern predatory cats at removing flesh from a carcass.

She said: 'The fossil record of modern lions and leopards goes back to about 2 million years, their dietary adaptations would probably have been similar to the living species today. 

'Where the difference comes in is with the three species (three genera, actually) of sabertoothed cats that were around when hominins first started eating meat.

'They would have likely left even more meat on carcasses, because their teeth are even more adapted to slicing flesh.' 

Dr Pobiner said her findings had helped to dispell the idea that early humans would have struggled to find enough meat to survive by scavenging the meat left by larger predators.

She said: 'We tend to think of scavenging as second-rate to hunting, somehow a lesser form of acquiring resources from animal carcasses, that scavengers are lower on the hierarchy and only left with piddly scraps. 

'This stems from the earliest interpretations, dating back to 1925, of ancient humans as carnivorous, predatory killers based on associated broken animal fossils construed as being used as weapons.’ 

She believes, however, that more research is needed to understand whether  scavenging provided a dietary stepping stone as our ancestors moved towards eating more meat.

Writing in the Journal of Human Evolution, Dr Pobiner said: 'This study supports the hypothesis that passive scavenging from abandoned larger felid kills could have a been a high-yield, though potentially dangerous, strategy for early hominins even without considering within bone nutrients.'
