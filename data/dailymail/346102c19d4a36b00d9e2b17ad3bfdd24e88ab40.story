Ms Pascale has only been in the UK for a year and is known to stay at addresses in Smethwick, West Midlands and Coventry. She was last seen on the evening of November 19 in West Bromwich.

Officers also confirmed a house in West Bromwich has been sealed off by police while forensic enquiries are carried out.

Superintendent Rich Youds, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Investigations into Lydia's disappearance are continuing, as a result of which officers arrested two men who are currently being questioned.

'We are also carrying out searches at a property in West Bromwich as part of our enquiries.

'We are increasingly concerned for Lydia's welfare and continue to appeal for help and information concerning the whereabouts of Lydia.

'It is completely out of character for her to go missing.

'She has not contacted her friends or her family, so we are urging anyone who has seen her to get in touch.'
