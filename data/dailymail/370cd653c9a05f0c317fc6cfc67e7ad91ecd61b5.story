Doting mum Rachel Gage will give her little girl the best present of all - the gift of life.

The 25-year-old's newborn daughter Poppy was diagnosed with a liver disease, which only affects one in every 16,000 children, when she was just weeks old.

And after undergoing a life-saving operation she may one day still need a liver transplant - which the primary school teacher,  from Darlington, is ready to give her.

Doting Mum Rachel Gage has vowed that if her daughter Poppy, who suffers from a rare liver condition biliary atresia which causes inflammation of the bile ducts and liver, needs a liver transplant she will donate hers

The condition affects only one in 16,000 children and Poppy has already spent stretches of her  life in hospital

At just seven weeks old Poppy was diagnosed with biliary atresia, a rare condition in which the bile ducts in the liver become progressively blocked which leads to irreversible liver damage.

And the prognosis is still uncertain, with medics saying there is an 85 per cent chance that Poppy will need a liver transplant in the next two years.

Today, just a month after her operation, her mum Rachel Gage is hoping her own liver will be enough to save Poppy if she needs it.

The primary school teacher, from Darlington, said: 'I would do anything for her and I would give her my liver if I could.'  

Poppy was born weighing just over 5lb and Rachel and her partner Dale Thomas, 26, noticed that her skin was jaundiced.

Following several appointments with GPs, hospital medics made the diagnosis.

Rachel said: 'I didn't have a clue what it was then they started talking about the liver and I just broke down.

'No words could describe how I felt. We were both hoping it was something different. I just kept telling myself that everything was going to be OK.'

In a harrowing moment parents Rachel and Dale kissed their daughter goodbye as they handed her over to surgeons to complete the operation. 

The Children's Liver Disease Foundation describe bilary atresia, which effects one in every 16,000 children, as: 'A condition in which inflammation develops within the bile ducts around the time of birth. 

'The inflammation can occur in any of the bile ducts both inside and outside the liver. This leads to bile duct damage, reducing the flow of bile, which causes scarring of the liver.' 

The bile ducts carry bile, which is needed to digest fat in the diet, to the gut. 

Symptoms include pale stools, yellowed skin and potentially frequent nosebleeds. 

Those who suffer from bilary atresia will generally undergo the Kasai procedure'where the bile is drained from the liver into the gut. 

The reasons for the disease are unknown and even after the Kasai procedure is complete there is still a large risk of further issues such as bloody stools, itching and in some cases failure to thrive.  

'It was awful,' said Rachel, 'We had to take her down to theatre and then we gave her a kiss goodbye. She's our little miracle.'

Poppy, who is now 11-weeks-old, is doing well after the surgery to clear the build-up of bile from her liver and medics are pleased with her progress.

The family are expected to be told if Poppy needs a liver transplant in the near future. 

Meanwhile, Rachel hopes that little Poppy's story will raise awareness of the disease.
