If you’ve been sent a random email asking you to change your Twitter password, don’t worry you haven’t been hacked, the social networking site just made a mistake. 

Millions of users were locked out of their accounts on Monday night before being sent emails from ‘The Twitter Team’ asking them to reset their passwords.

A spokesman for Twitter has since revealed the emails were sent ‘unintentionally’ and it was the fault of a ‘system error’, but did not elaborate further.

Twitter users around the world were locked out of their accounts last night after the site 'unintentionally' reset their passwords. A spokesman for the California-based site assured users they had not been hacked and blamed the fault on a system error. Stock image of Twitter is pictured

In November 2012, Twitter was hit by a major hacker attack and asked affected users to reset their password.

However, thousands of reset emails were also sent to unaffected people by mistake.

Twitter
 apologised and said in a blog post at the time: ‘In
 instances when we believe an account may have been compromised, we 
reset the password and send an email letting the account owner know this
 has happened.

'In
 this case, we unintentionally reset passwords of a larger number of 
accounts, beyond those that we believed to have been compromised.'

He continued: ‘We apologise to the affected users for the inconvenience.’

These kind of emails are a common tactic used by hackers phishing for information.

As a result, many affected users took to Twitter to ask if the site had been hacked. 

The reset notices also warned users their accounts 'may have been compromised by a website or service not associated with Twitter.'

It continued: ‘We’ve reset your password to prevent others from accessing your account.’

The spokesman confirmed the number of affected users was ‘less than one per cent of the company’s base’ - but that is still one per cent of at least a billion users.

Twitter added that those affected should be able to access their accounts after updating their passwords.

This is the second time the site has accidentally forced its users to reset their passwords.

Twitter apologised for mistakenly resetting 'the large number' of accounts and its security specialists confirmed it had reset a larger number of passwords than they had intended.
