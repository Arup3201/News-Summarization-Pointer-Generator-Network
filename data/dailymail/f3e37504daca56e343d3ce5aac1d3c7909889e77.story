When Clare Houghton headed to London for a day out with her partner of ten years, she expected city walks and tourist attractions - not a ring.

Instead the mother-of-two, from Northamptonshire, was surprised by a romantic proposal featuring a choir, pictures commemorating her relationship with Lee Esselmonth, 29, and a red rose - all 138ft above the Thames. 

And the moment Lee walked off under the guise of needing the toilet and Clare, 26, entered the glass walkway for the romantic surprise  has been captured on video. 

Lee, who had the proposal planned for months, made an excuse to walk off as they were about to go in

Clare was then left to enter the glass walkway on her own where she found six canvases covered in photos, quotes and memories of their relationship with tags on which Lee had written, 'You are and always will be my everything'.

One was emblazoned with pictures of the couple as children, another included pictures and memories of their first date and an Egyptian holiday, ending with  Lee's message: 'wherever we went we were happy because we were together.'

When she reached the end, a chorus of West End singers came out and sang her favourite song when Lee walked out with a rose to propose.

The pair then clutched each other and swayed in a tearful embrace as the singers serenaded them.

Lee said: 'I first had the idea that I wanted to propose in 2013.

'I had the ideas of what I wanted and the level that I wanted to take it but I found it impossible to put together myself and keep it a hidden secret.

'Clare means the world to me. We have two children and have been together for 10 years. She always puts all of us first and I wanted a day that was just about her to show her just how much she is loved.

Clare was then left to enter the glass walkway on her own, and she was overwhelmed

The mother-of-two never expected anything like this - although she knew if Lee proposed it would be special

Lee says he will never forget the day he became the first man to propose on Tower Bridge's new walkway 

Finally Lee got down on one knee to pop the question as Clare sobbed with emotion. 

She said: 'It was such an amazing and overwhelming feeling when Lee proposed on the bridge, I had goose bumps. It was the most magical experience of my life.

'I always knew if Lee did propose one day it would be so special and romantic but I really didn't expect or dream of anything like this.

'Lee really blew me away with his love. It's the most amazing feeling calling him my fiancée. I'll never forget that magical day.'

The event, which took place on 27 November, 2014, was organised by The Proposers, a small independent company who plan extravagant proposals for men.

Lee said: 'After so much planning and keeping the secret for so long, it was breathtaking to see it all come together.

Happy family: Lee and Clare, who have two  children, have been together for ten years

Lee helped prepare posters and collages that pinpointed key moments in his relationship with Clare

Clare Houghton, who was in tears throughout her surprise proposal, said: ''Lee really blew me away'

'It all ran so smoothly. To be the first person to propose on the new glass walkway and get the answer I wanted is something that will stay with me forever.' 

And the location has a special place for Clare and Lee. She said: 'We first visited Tower Bridge and stayed at the hotel overlooking the Tower eight years ago so it's a really special place we love to go back to relax and visit.

The Proposers' Daisy Amodio said: 'Times have changed, couples now want a bit more of a story and come to us for inspiration and execution, so they can concentrate on saying those four famous words and having a great time.'
