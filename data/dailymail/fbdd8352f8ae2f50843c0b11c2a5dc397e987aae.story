First Lady Michelle Obama had made it clear she has no interest in following in her husband's footsteps and running for office, yet an Illinois Senator is implying otherwise as a means to rustle up cash for reelection bid.

Republican Sen. Mark Kirk sent out a fundraising email last week invoking Obama and claimed that 'press and rumor mills' say she's eyeing a bid for his Senate seat in 2016.

'I’m not one to believe rumors or engage in political gossip,' Kirk said, according to a news report published on Thursday in the Chicago Sun-Times, 'but when it comes to defending the Illinois Senate seat that I’m honored to hold, I take all potential threats seriously.'

Michelle Obama is pictured here taking a service project at the Inspired Teaching School on Thursday to commemorate the September 11th National Day of Service and Remembrance. Obama has said that after she leaves the White House in 2017 she'll take on a 'mission-based' or 'service-based' role

The gossip columns were indeed abuzz earlier this summer with rumors that Michelle could make a play for her husband's former Senate seat next election cycle as their time in the White House comes to a close

But the president, first lady and a senior adviser to the White House have all denied that Michelle is interested in a political career of her own. 

'No. I'm absolutely 100 percent positive that will never happen,' White House adviser and Obama confidant Valerie Jarrett said in June on NBC's 'Meet the Press.' 

'One thing I can promise you is that Michelle will not run for office,' President Obama told ABC News in May. 

Michelle Obama herself told ABC in June that her next role 'will not be political.'

'It will be mission-based, it will be service-focused,' she said.

The Obamas have also made a point of telling anyone who will listen how much Michelle dislikes her husband being on the road and how glad she is that November is his 'last election.'

The first lady's aversion to campaigning has been well-documented throughout the Obamas time in the White House and national Democrats have complained in recent weeks about her unwillingness to hit the campaign trail for the party's Senate candidates this fall.

If Obama really is planning to run for office in 2016, she's running the stealthiest campaign in modern politics.

Even so, Kirk is contending that Michelle Obama may pull a Hillary Clinton and run for office anyway.

'The circumstances (and denials) are reminiscent of 1999 when First Lady Hillary Clinton was the subject of whirlwind speculation about a run for the United States Senate,' he states.

'Whether or not you choose to believe this most recent rumor, there is no doubt the Illinois Senate race will be one of the most closely watched and hotly contested races in the country in 2016,' he said before asking supporters to donate as much as $1,000 to help him keep his seat.

The Sun-Times points out that as of June 30, Kirk had $1,419,695 in cash-on-hand more than two years out from his next election, which is a quite a large sum, even in the Chicago media market.
