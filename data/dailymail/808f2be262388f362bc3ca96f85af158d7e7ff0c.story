Xabi Alonso is prepared to get battered and bruised all over again for Spain after the 2010 World Cup final saw Holland's Nigel de Jong 'kung-fu kick' the midfielder in the chest.

Four years ago, Alonso felt the full force of De Jong's boot in what the Real Madrid player described as 'one of the worst tackles I have ever suffered'.

But Alonso won't let that stop him this time around, as the 32-year-old showed he's ready for battle.

Kick: Xabi Alonso is ready to go to battle for Spain, just as the midfielder did in 2010

Battered and bruised: Alonso is ready to go again for Spain at the 2014 World Cup

High challenge: Nigel de Jong plants his foot in the chest of Alonso, but the Holland man didn't see red

Prepared: Alonso will hope he won't have to go through such a challenge again during the 2014 World Cup

Pain: It left Alonso on the deck holding his chest after the 'kung-fu kick' took the midfielder out

This is likely to be Alonso's final World Cup and the ex-Liverpool player will hope to mark it with yet another win, although he admits he has 'not decided' whether he will quit internationally yet.

Alonso, of course, would like to do it without another feisty challenge.

Spain sit in Group B alongside Australia, Chile and Holland. Their first match is against the Netherlands on Friday.
