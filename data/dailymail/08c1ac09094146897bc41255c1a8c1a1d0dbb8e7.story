A 90-year-old Holocaust survivor made his orchestral debut with renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma last night and played music composed 70 years ago in a Nazi prison camp.

George Horner and Ma received floral bouquets and a standing ovation from the audience of about 1,000 people at Boston's Symphony Hall. 

The performance benefited the Terezin Music Foundation, an organisation dedicated to preserving the work of artists and musicians killed in the Holocaust.

Moving: George Horner plays piano alongside renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma in Boston

Dr Horner, a retired doctor who now lives in Newtown, Philadelphia, was 21 when he was freed by Allied soldiers in 1945 after serving time at Terezin, Auschwitz and Buchenwald.

His parents and sister perished in the camps.

Although his back still bears the scars of a Nazi beating, he remains sprightly and seems much younger than his 90 years.

Ma, who was born 10 years after the end of the Second World War, said before the performance that he hoped it will inspire people to a better future.

He said: 'I grew up with the words, "never again".

'It
 is kind of inconceivable that there are people who say the Holocaust 
didn't exist. George Horner is a living contradiction of what those 
people are saying.'

He said
 Horner was able to survive 'because he had music, because he had 
friends, because the power of music could fill in the empty spaces.'

He added: 'To me George Horner is a huge hero, and is a huge inspiration.

'He is a witness to a window, and to a
 slice of history, that we never want to see again, and yet we keep 
seeing versions of that all over the world. I hope we are inspired by 
that and we keep that memory forever.'

Led by Ludwig, the foundation is named for the town of Terezin, site of an unusual Jewish ghetto in what was then German-occupied Czechoslovakia.

Even amid death and hard labour, Nazi soldiers allowed prisoners to stage artistic performances.

Legacy: Horner agreed to do the performance which he described as a 'noble' mission

Horner played piano and accordion in the Terezin cabarets, including tunes written by fellow inmate Karel Svenk.

Last night Horner played two of Svenk's works solo — a march and a lullaby — and then teamed up with Ma for a third piece called 'How Come the Black Man Sits in the Back of the Bus?'

 appeared to enjoy their evening, chatting briefly between numbers and 
walking off the stage hand-in-hand after taking a bow together.

Before the performance, Ma and Horner met and embraced ahead of a brief rehearsal.

Ma
 thanked Horner for helping the Terezin Music Foundation, named for the 
town of Terezin, site of an unusual Jewish ghetto in what was then 
German-occupied Czechoslovakia.

'It's an extraordinary link to the past,' said concert organizer Mark Ludwig.

Svenk did not survive the genocide. 

But his musical legacy has, due in part to a chance meeting of Ludwig, a scholar of Terezin composers, and Horner, who never forgot the songs that were written and played in captivity.

Ludwig said he found it hard to ask Horner to perform pieces laden with such difficult memories.

'To ask somebody who played this in the camps, that's asking a lot,' said Ludwig.

Yet Horner readily agreed to what he described as a 'noble' mission. 

It didn't hurt that he would be sharing the stage with Ma — even if he thought Ludwig was joking at first.

'I couldn't believe it, because it's a fantastic thing for me.'

The program featured additional performances by Ma and the Hawthorne String Quartet.

When Horner found out about the duet with Ma, Ludwig said, 'he was so excited, to me he sounded like a teenager.'
