Kelly Rutherford was seen back at work on the New York set of hit show Gossip Girl on Thursday.

Her real life of late has echoed the trials and tribulations suffered by some of the characters as it emerged that she lost 'residential custody' of her young children.

The 43-year-old Gossip Girl actress who plays Blake Lively's mother in the show is said to be 
'devastated' after a judge ruled her five-year-old son and 
three-year-old daughter should remain with their father in France, where he
currently resides.

And now it has been revealed the judge gave custody to her ex-husband Daniel Giersch as it was his opinion that she had repeatedly tried to cut her ex-husband out their children's lives.

The show must go on: Actress Kelly Rutherford returned to work on the set of Gossip Girl in New York, after it emerged that the judge felt she was 'attempting to cut father Daniel Giersch out of their children's lives'

The judge says Giersch - who lives in France - did facilitate the relationship, according to TMZ.

Meanwhile, Rutherford refused to put 
Daniel's name on their daughter's birth certificate, despite repeated 
requests to do so from the court.

The judge wrote: 'Even while under the
scrutiny of an extended trial, Kelly still has declined to demonstrate 
the level of commitment to facilitating the relationship that would be 
required of a residential parent in a relocation situation.'

Under the arrangement, U.S.-based 
Rutherford will get the children 50 per cent of the time - but they will
live and go to school in France.

Rutherford was fighting the 37-year-old German businessman in family court to bring her children back to the U.S.

TMZ previously reported Giersch is unable to return to the U.S. because his visa has been revoked as of April this year.

According to the website, the judge 
ruled Rutherford will be allowed a flexible visitation schedule so that 
she may spend time with her children when travel and work arrangements 
allow.

According to 
the ruling, she will be permitted to see their five-year-old son and 
three-year-old daughter 50 per cent of the time.

However Rutherford, who married Giersch back in 2006 and divorced him in 2010, plans to appeal the ruling.

Rutherford’s lawyer’s attempted to 
depose Giersch, a German businessman, about his visa, back in 2010 but 
at the time the judge ruled in favor of Giersch, noting that the risk of
him being deported and taking the children to Germany was 'very low.'

It's unclear when Giersch took the children to France and how long Rutherford expected the visit to last.

It makes for another disappointing 
legal row for Rutherford, who in April was sued by a private eye 
claiming he was hired to spy on Giersch.

According to court documents obtained
by TMZ, the actress engaged the services of Edward Banach to spy on her
ex back in April 2010 'in relation to certain issues regarding child 
custody and other matters'.

The website reports the pair went 
through a messy divorce, with issues of 'restraining orders and 
allegations of child endangerment'.

Banach alleges he spent months snooping on Giersch's ex, which left Rutherford with a whopping bill of $86,249.85.

However, he alleges he only got paid $28,214.35, leaving bills of around $58,000 unpaid.

Now, Banach - who was sub-contracted 
through a now-defunct security company - is suing the business along 
with Rutherford to get the remaining $58,000.

According to TMZ, at the height of 
their legal disputes, Rutherford admitted she hired a private 
investigator to prove Giersch  'did not properly secure the pool and 
play areas at his home,' which she alleges endangered the couple's young
son.

The warring pair also previously argued over 
'potty-training' their son and the actress’s ex claimed he was never 
notified of the birth, and instead read about it in online reports.

He put out a statement soon after the
birth that said: 'I was never informed by Kelly about the birth of our 
daughter, nor was I invited to attend.

'In fact, I found out about it 
through Internet reports like everyone else. Although this sickens me, I
am of course overjoyed that our baby was born healthy.

'I would’ve wanted nothing more than 
to hold our newborn daughter for a few moments, and I only seek to 
co-parent both our children responsibly and with love.'

Rutherford’s publicist Jill Fritzo 
countered: 'The doctors advised that no one be in the birthing room; 
[Daniel] was notified when [Helena] was born and was immediately invited
to come see her.'

The Gossip Girl star was previously married to Carlos Tarajano for seven months, before their union dissolved in January 2002.

A representative for the actress has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment.

Rutherford
saw mainstream success after nearly ten years in showbusiness thanks to
her role as call girl Megan Lewis in television drama Melrose Place  for three years beginning in 1996.
