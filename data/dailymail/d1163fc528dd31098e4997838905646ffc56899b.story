A prototype of the highly-anticipated Tesla Model X has apparently been seen cruising around California.

A video by Youtuber ‘nbkagzw13’ claims to show the pure electric vehicle, slightly covered to hide design features, on the road near Palo Alto.

It comes as Tesla confirmed to Dailymail.com the new model will include autosteering and self parking capabilities announced by Elon Musk last week.

The concealment hides its grille, headlights, rear window and taillights, but the car is otherwise undisguised.

Tesla first unveiled the Model X in 2012 with the original prediction of having the luxury crossover ready for sale in 2013.

But the launch date has been pushed back several times, and the Tesla website currently states that it should be ready in 2016.

However, a number of reports suggest the sighting of this test vehicle could mean the Model X will hit dealerships as early as this year.

And this isn’t the first time the Model X has been spotted on the roads by Tesla enthusiasts.

Electric vehicles are a useful tool for fighting city summers, according to a new study.

Switching from vehicles powered by fossil fuels to plug-in equivalents would ease a phenomenon called urban heat island, it said.

The term describes what happens when city temperatures are driven higher by heat from traffic and air conditioners and by warmth, stored during the day in roads and buildings, which is released at night.

The researcher's simulation was based on the weather in the Chinese capital in the summer of 2012, when the city was three degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the surrounding countryside.

Switching vehicles to electric would have caused this to fall by 0.94 C (1.7 F), according to their model.

'Heatwaves kill, and in terms of climate change, even one degree can make a difference,' said Jianguo Liu of Michigan State University, who took part in the study.

Earlier this year, a video emerged of the Model X doing handling, braking and acceleration in a private lot.

The Model X is expected to weigh around 10 per cent more than the Model S, but will share 60 per cent of its parts.

Tesla claims the performance model will be able to go from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in about 4.4 seconds.

Last week, the California-based company revealed two key software updates for the Tesla model S sedan and the Model X that he claims will end 'range anxiety'.

The first is a 'range assurance' app that communicates with Tesla's Supercharger network, warning drivers if they are about to run out of power, and pointing them to the nearest Supercharger.

The second is a trip planner, which will combine the Supercharger network with the network of Model S cars to improve long-distance journeys for drivers.

Other features that will be coming soon include the addition of autosteering for the Model S, which should be available in the next three months. 

The technology means drivers will not have to control the wheel, acceleration and braking when the car is on a the motorway.

In the future, the company will also give driver's the ability to summon their car to any location.
