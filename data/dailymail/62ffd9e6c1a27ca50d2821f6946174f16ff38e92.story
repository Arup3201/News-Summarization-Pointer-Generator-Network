Police believe a skull found on an island off Panama could be that of a missing American woman Yvonne
Baldelli who disappeared almost two years ago.

Miss Baldelli, 42, was last seen in November 2011 on Isla Carenero, 
an island off Panama's 
Caribbean coast.

Her boyfriend ex-Marine Brian
Brimager, 37, was arrested in June on charges of obstructing justice and making false statements.

Grim discovery: Police believe a skull discovered in a backpack in Panama could be that of missing American woman Yvonne
Baldelli

He is accused of assaulting Miss Baldelli before staging an elaborate cover-up which included deceiving her family into believing she was still alive with emails and withdrawals from her bank account.

It is also claimed he married another woman just weeks after Ms 
Baldelli went missing.

On Tuesday, a local on Isla Carenero discovered a 'green military style' backpack containing a human skull, some bones and women's clothing, according to law enforcement.

Police on the island told a Panamanian website that size and shape of the skull suggested it was female.

Brian Brimager is charged with covering-up the disappearance of his girlfriend Yvonne Baldelli, who went missing in Panama in November 2011

Miss Baldelli was last seen at a steakhouse in 
the town of Bocas del Toro with Brimager on November 26, 2011, according to the U.S.
Attorney's office, which also said he physically abused her before she went missing.

He has not been charged with murder 
but faces ten counts of obstruction of justice and one count of false 
statement to a federal officer.

Brimager is accused of 
dumping a bloody mattress in the ocean to cover up his girlfriend's death
after searching online for how to get the stains out.

He is said to have packed her belongings into garbage bags and left them outside the hostel for disposal.

The indictment claims that on November 29 Brimager began sending fake emails to a hotel manager, friends and family
from Ms Baldelli's account.

Possible scene: This is the home where Ms Baldelli and Mr Brimager lived while in Panama. The FBI said that they would be sending divers to search the area around their home

It
also states that on his way back to California he made a two-day 
layover in Costa Rica and used her ATM card to make it look like she was
withdrawing money.

This
was to back up the retired Marine's story that had Ms Baldelli had 
'broken up with Brimager and was headed to Costa Rica with a man named 
Tony Gonzales.'

'Brimager impersonated Baldelli over 
email in an attempt to trick her friends and family into believing she 
was still alive, thereby obstructing, influencing and impeding 
investigation into her disappearance and suspected death,' the 
indictment says.

The indictment adds that when Brimager landed in San Diego on December 12, 2011, another woman, known as K.W., met him at the airport.

'He proposed to her two days later and they married shortly thereafter,' the document states.

Brimager faces a maximum sentence of 205 years in prison and a $2.5million fine if found guilty of every charge.
