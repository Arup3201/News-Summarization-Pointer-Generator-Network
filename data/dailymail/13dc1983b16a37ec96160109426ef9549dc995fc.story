The BBC’s reporting of the Falklands War was considered so ‘treacherous’ by senior Tories that the Corporation only narrowly escaped a Government takeover, an official history reveals.

Margaret Thatcher’s right hand man, Willie Whitelaw, was under huge pressure to invoke emergency protocols normally reserved for a nuclear attack against Britain in 1982.

This would have allowed the Government to take charge of what was being broadcast about the Falklands conflict to protect Britain’s national interests and the morale of the country and the troops.

In a history of the BBC, published today, it emerges that Mrs Thatcher was incandescent with the BBC for apparently questioning support for the war and even refusing to call soldiers ‘our boys’.

Inside Downing Street, there was particular fury at a May 1982 edition of Panorama which gave a platform to the war’s critics at Westminster and implied that senior military figures also had reservations about it.

The Prime Minister, who had staked he political reputation on reclaiming the islands from Argentina, believed that – during the crucial second month of the conflict - the BBC had ‘exaggerated the case of a few dissidents.

Her view, according to official historian Jean Seaton of the University of Westminster, was that it had let down ‘the Army, the country and her’.

Her husband, Denis, later remarked: ‘I will never forget it. How could the bloody BBC question the integrity of the military? I was livid with rage and have hated them since that day.’

In response to the Panorama programme, the BBC’s soon-to-be director general, Alasdair Milne, and chairman Lord Howard were summoned to appear before a meeting of the Tory MPs’ Media Committee.

The meeting was called by Home Secretary Mr Whitelaw, whose department was then in charge of overseeing the BBC, to allow Tory MPs to vent their fury.

The book says: ‘Whitelaw wanted to ‘let them get it off their chests’. Whitelaw was under immense pressure, however, to use the power that Government’s possessed under the Corporation’s Charter to take it over and to direct what it broadcast.

‘These powers existed to cover the transition to war in a nuclear attack.

‘Whitelaw saw the blood-letting as a last-ditch attempt to protect the BBC from something far worse: government control.’

The BBC refused to refer to British forces heading to the Falklands as 'our boys' which angered Mrs Thatcher

During the meeting, MPs were so furious that one accused the BBC of being ‘obsequious’ to Argentina.

In a separate row, Mrs Thatcher also accused the Corporation of ‘treacherously’ calling the troops ‘the British troops’ on Newsnight, rather than ‘us’ or ‘our’.

The book, titled Pinkoes and Traitors, reveals this decision was based on official BBC guidelines, which went to everyone at the Corporation.

The startling claims are contained withing a new book on the BBC between 1974-1987

Underlined, this edict stated: ‘NOT OUR TROOPS’. It went on: We should try to avoid using ‘our’ when we mean British. We are not Britain. We are the BBC’.

Throughout her time as Conservative leader, Mrs Thatcher was involved in regular clashes with the BBC, which she considered to be over-manned and a mouthpiece for Left-wing propaganda.

She complained about bad language, pro-trade union bias and the effect of TV on children. Repeatedly, suggestions were made the BBC should be made to fund itself by screening advertising.

The book, which chronicles the Corporation’s history between 1974 and 1987, states: ‘Maladroitly, it [the BBC] fell into the trap of being defined as an ‘enemy’.

‘At numerous levels within the BBC they discussed what to do for her, with her, how to ration her appearances on Savile shows, how to check her capacity to wipe the floor with interrogators’.

The history also chronicles how BBC staff were regularly vetted by MI5 to see if they had extremist views or might pose a threat to national security.

At one stage, 1,400 people were being checked every year by the Security Service – a defence the Corporation relied upon when under attack from Mrs Thatcher.

In January 1980, the Prime Minister forwarded the BBC a letter accusing it of Left-wing bias because of a sequence on Nationwide about the use of flying pickets in a steel dispute.

The BBC replied: ‘I expect you will know that anyone with access to programme decisions, and in certain other sensitive areas (about 40% of staff) is vetted at our request by the Security Service.

‘If therefore any ideological extremists slip through it is hardly our fault.’
