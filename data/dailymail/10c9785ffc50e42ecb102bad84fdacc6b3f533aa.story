Holidaymakers are being given a sneak peek inside what’s in store for them on board Royal Caribbean’s newest ship, Quantum of the Seas, in a new video.

Teaming up with author and TV presenter Jason Bradbury, the cruise line's footage reveals passengers will be able to enjoy skydiving, a 300ft-high observation deck, and first-at-sea entertainment.

In the two-minute clip, Bradbury takes viewers on a technological tour on what is being billed as ‘the world’s most futuristic and advanced ship’, set to launch on November 23.

The C5 Gadget Show host, who’s a ‘self-confessed geek’, showcases the ‘ground-breaking technology and new entertainment offerings’ – including ‘things that have never been tried on a cruise ship before’.

The 4,180-passenger ship will boast an iFLY skydiving experience on board, of which Bradbury says: ‘Skydiving on board a ship; isn't that astonishing.’

The cruise line, which already boasts zip lines, real trees, boxing rings and the world's first sea bound amphitheatre on board its ships, is also launching the North Star: a jewel-shaped, glass capsule.

The bubble-like structure, which was inspired by the London Eye, will give those brave enough to be hoisted high above the ocean incredible 360-degree views, lifting as many as 13 guests at a time.

Bradbury says: ‘It's basically a pod that carries you 300ft above the deck of a while at sea or at port, giving you a completely unique perspective.’

Talking about Quantum of the Sea’s ‘futuristic approach to entertainment’, Bradbury says the best example is Two70°.

As well as boasting stunning 270-degree, the room will be used for concerts and performances, which will also involve ‘robotic’ screens – which move independently or together -  and be projected onto 100ft-wide windows over 20ft high – which has never been done before.

Guests will have the chance to rollerskate - or try out bumper cars - in the transforming SeaPlex area

He adds: ‘This is a space you can go to in the day and get this beautiful 270-degree vista, but if you go back there in the evening, it's like you've walked into a completely different place.’

Speaking about the vessel, which boasts 18 decks and weighs 167,800 registered tonnes, Bradbury adds: ‘The technology on board this ship is extraordinary. 

‘This is an absolute game changer and will completely revolutionise the way we holiday.’

Other new features, which will be free to all passengers, include The Sea-Plex, the largest indoor sports and entertainment complex at sea with bumper cars, a simulated skydiving experience, a version of the line's popular FlowRider surfing simulator, and 'virtual balconies' - video screens that provide streaming views of the ship's surroundings to interior cabins.

The Quantum of the Seas will also have Jamie's Italian restaurants, new 'family connected' staterooms are designed to offer more flexibility for multi-generational travel and 'studio' staterooms, especially for single travellers.
