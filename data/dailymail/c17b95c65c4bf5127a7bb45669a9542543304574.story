Police were called after workers at the facility made the horrifying discovery, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. 

At 16 weeks of development, fetuses are about 4.5 inches long and have eyes and ears, according to the Mayo Clinic. 

Henderson police spokeswoman Kathleen Richards declined to release a police report about the incident. 

Officers are still working to determine how the dead babies got mixed in with the laundry. 

Foul play is not suspected, according to FOX5. 

The remains of the babies, which were wrapped in linen before they arrived at Spring Valley, are back in the hospital's possession.

Spring Valley Hospital spokeswoman Gretchen Papez said: 'After suffering a miscarriage at another location, the patient arrived via EMS with twins - early gestational, deceased fetuses. 

'The fetuses had already been wrapped in linen prior to arrival at the hospital. 

'We are currently reviewing the situation to determine what occurred. 

'However, the remains are currently in the hospital's possession and we are working with the family at this time.'

The 237-bed hospital opened in southwest Las Vegas in 2003.
