Three people have been shot outside the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado following a hip-hop concert featuring Nas, Schoolboy Q and Flying Lotus.

Police said the violence broke out in the venue's parking lot after the concert had finished.

The Jefferson County Sheriff's office said the Red Rocks Amphitheater, which is located about 10 miles west of Denver, Colorado, was shut down late Thursday night when the violence erupted.

The victims all left the scene together 
in a white SUV but were found a short while later as they tried to make 
their way back to nearby Denver.

Mark Techmeyer, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, told the Denver Post that the victims were found alive by police on 5th Avenue and Kalamath Street about 11pm, with two other passengers in the car, adding that they were helping with the investigation.

According 
to updates tweeted by the sheriff's office, police were continuing 
to work at the venue and its car park overnight.

The shooter, however, remained at large.

The suspect - or 
suspects - were still being sought and all cars are being searched as 
concertgoers left the facility, but no-one was in custody.

Access to the park was expected in the morning and police were appealing for anyone with information about the attack to contact them.

The three artists, Nas, Schoolboy Q and Flying Lotus, were performing at the open air venue as part of the 'Feed The Rocks' gig.

The venue's website states it was to be a 'grassroots' event aimed at giving back to the community.

Red Rocks is an open-air amphitheatre formed by the surrounding rock formations. The amphitheatre seats about 9,500 people.
