A mother and grandmother of two died in agony seven months after a stand-in consultant operated on her in the wrong place, causing huge blood loss and brain damage.

Lalitaben Patel, 71, suffered a massive haemorrhage after mistakes by Mudhafar Alhiwidi, during a routine gall bladder procedure at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, resulted in three holes in a major artery.

Theatre staff assisting the surgeon became so concerned after he spent two hours 'operating in completely the wrong place' that they called in a senior surgeon to come and finish the procedure, according to a report by the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.

He completed the operation, removing 90 
per cent of Mrs Patel's gall bladder, but the report said that errors 
made by Mr Alhiwidi, who had only been at the hospital for two weeks, 
had already caused huge blood loss, resulting in damage to Mrs Patel's 
brain.

Tragedy: Lalitaben Patel, 71, died after a botched routine gall bladder operation at Leicester Royal Infirmary

Mrs Patel's condition deteriorated significantly after the operation at Leicester Royal Infirmary in May 2012, and she died in December 2012 after months of agony.

A letter sent from the trust to Mrs Patel’s family following an official investigation stated that Mr Alhiwidi 'should not have been anywhere near this artery.  He was operating in completely the wrong place'.

The grandmother of two's family criticised the hospital for failures relating to her care, including a lack of ‘robust’ supervision to determine Mr Alhiwidi’s skills as a surgeon.

Daughter Dipika Patel, 40, said: 'He’d only been at the hospital for two weeks, with limited checks regarding his capability as a consultant.

'Because of the hospital’s failure to assess his ability, my mum died.'

At an inquest held earlier this month into Mrs Patel’s death, Leicester coroner Catherine Mason returned a narrative verdict.

She said the medical evidence was that the dissection during the initial stages of the gall bladder operation was inappropriate and led to a massive secondary haemorrhage.

'This in turn led to Mrs Patel suffering problems after her surgery, the injury to her brain and ultimately her death on December 20, 2012 at the Leicester General Hospital,' added Mrs Mason.

Mrs Patel was otherwise fit and healthy when she went into Leicester Royal Infirmary for the operation

The cause of death was given as sepsis, catheter-related urinary tract infection, cirrhosis and complications following the gall bladder operation, including lack of oxygen to the brain.

The case prompted the coroner to write to the Department of Health calling managers to take steps to prevent similar tragedies happening in future.

Mrs Mason wrote: 'Evidence revealed that the systems in place for signing off a locum consultant as competent to undertake independent practice were not as robust as they should have been.'

She said the trust had now changed both its recruitment process and the processes for signing off a locum consultant as competent, but said some other hospital trusts still had less stringent practices.

The coroner added: 'Accordingly, there is a real risk that what happened in this case could happen elsewhere.

  'There is a real risk that what happened in this case could happen elsewhere - action should be taken to prevent future deaths'

'In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths, and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.'

Dipika Patel claimed the infirmary had failed her mother in numerous aspects of her care and left her 'in a mess' until the day she died.

She said: 'The hospital failed to diagnose problems, failed to give her treatment, left her waiting for more than 10 hours in a wheelchair, soaked in bile and refused her pain medication.

'We’ve been given a letter of apology, but I’m shocked that these failures could happen in a modern hospital.'

In a statement apologising to the family, Dr Kevin Harris, medical director of Leicester’s hospitals, said: 'On behalf of the members of staff who were involved in Mrs Patel’s care, I offer my heartfelt apologies and deepest condolences.

'Since the events of last year, we have changed our vetting process for locum surgeons to ensure that they are capable of operating to the same high standard as the surgeons we employ directly.'

The trust confirmed that Mr Alhiwidi had his contract terminated and was reported to the General Medical Council, which has imposed temporary restrictions on his licence to practice while further investigations are carried out.

As a result, Mr Alhiwidi, who is now believed to be working as a locum surgeon elsewhere, must be supervised when performing laparoscopic surgery, and is not allowed to practise privately.
