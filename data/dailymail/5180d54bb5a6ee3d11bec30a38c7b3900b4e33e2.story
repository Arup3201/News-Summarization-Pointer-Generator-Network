David Cameron has promised to give up sweet treats for a day – with the support of his wife – to back the campaign against obesity.

He said he will try to take up the challenge to have no sugar and no sugary drinks on one day this week.

The Prime Minister acknowledged that diabetes and obesity were ‘major health concerns’.

Challenge: David Cameron has vowed to give up sugar for a day in support of the campaign against obesity - but he suggested he may need his wife's help

Senior Labour MP Keith Vaz attempted to enlist Mr Cameron’s support in the ‘war on sugar’.

He warned voluntary measures to ensure manufacturers cut the sugar content in food and drinks by up to 30 per cent had not worked, adding that obesity and type 2 diabetes were ‘twin epidemics’.

After Mr Vaz asked him at Prime Minister’s Questions to take up the sugar-free challenge, Mr Cameron replied: ‘I’m sure that last proposal would have the strong support of Mrs Cameron so I will take that up if I possibly can.

‘Can I commend you for… speaking out on the issues of diabetes and obesity with such consistency, because they are major health concerns for our country.

‘We are taking them very seriously. We are rolling out the NHS health check programme to identify all those between 40 and 74 at risk of diabetes.’

'Childhood obesity rates are falling but there’s more that needs to be done. I’m happy to facilitate discussions between you and (Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt) to have the discussions you want.

'We take this issue very seriously. We think the Responsibility Deal has achieved great things but there is more to be done.”

Mr Vaz, MP for Leicester East, had said during Prime Minister’s Questions: “Launched last week, Action on Sugar aims to reduce the sugar content of food and drinks by up to 30% because of the twin epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

'Voluntary arrangements with manufacturers, though well-intentioned, have not worked. Will you meet with a delegation of health experts to discuss this issue and can we enlist your support in the war on sugar by asking you to give up sugar and sugary drinks for one day this week?”
