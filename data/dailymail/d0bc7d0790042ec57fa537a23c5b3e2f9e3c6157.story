Liverpool thrashed West Ham 5-0 on Friday night to keep up the pressure on Manchester United at the top of the Under 21 Premier League table.

The Reds moved to within one point of their rivals as a double from Ryan McLaughlin and strikes from Kevin Stewart, Cameron Brannagan and Sergi Canos routed the Hammers at Chester's Deva Stadium.

Unlike previous seasons there will be no end-of-season play-offs, meaning a straight shoot-out for the title. Liverpool's comprehensive win lifted them above Southampton and Tottenham into second and they still have a game in hand on United.

Having suffered a setback with defeat at Southampton on Monday, Liverpool were looking for a response against a West Ham team looking doomed to relegation to the second tier.

And it didn't take them long to make the breakthrough. In the third minute, a throw-in by Brad Smith wasn't cleared and Stewart seized upon the loose ball. From the edge of the box, he flicked the ball to create some space and curled it into the top corner.

A ssecond followed on six minutes when Harry Wilson's flick set Smith clear out wide. He crossed and Lewis Page's ineffective clearance fell straight to McLaughlin to fire home.

The London side managed to stem the flow for a little while but further goals seemed inevitable and Liverpool duly extended their lead a minute before half-time.

Canos broke clear down the left channel and squared to Brannagan to apply the finishing touch from close range.

Michael Beale's side were unlikely to let the match slip from such a strong position and they scored twice more after the break.

McLaughlin scored his second when Jordan Williams located the Northern Irishman in space on 65 minutes and Spanish forward Canos rounded things off with a classy finish eight minutes later.
