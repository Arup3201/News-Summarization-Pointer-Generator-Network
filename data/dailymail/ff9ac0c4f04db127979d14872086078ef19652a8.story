Watch your back, Meier! American NHL referee Brad Meier is now despised in Russia for ruling a goal in Team USA's favor during Saturday's game against the home team

Angry Russians today gathered at the American Embassy in Moscow to make apparent death threats against the US hockey referee who they blame for their country’s thrilling hockey loss to the states at the weekend.

Although the fans insist the threats to boil Brad Meir and render his flesh into soap are light-hearted, it reflects growing anger in the country at the decision to have an American referee adjudicate the crucial match.

Russian coach Zinetula Bilyaletdinov believes the game would have ended differently if Meier hadn't disallowed a Russian goal late in the game that would have put them in the lead.

'The referee made a mistake of course, it would have been more effective to have a different judge,' Bilyaletdinov said.

The score was 2-2 when a Russian player Fedor Tyutin hit the puck into the goal, but the score came into contention when American goaltender Jonathan Quick pointed out that the net was off its base.

After reviewing footage, Meier and Swedish referee Marcus Vinnerborg agreed that the net was off its base before the score and the goal couldn't be counted.

The crowd of more than 11,000 at Bolshoi Ice Dome, populated with home country fans including President Vladimir Putin, erupted in anger at the call.

'It was definitely a goal,' Russian player Alex Ovechkin said. 'The goalie touched the net so the net moved. The referee had to see it. [Meier] should have given [Quick] two minutes.'

Asked whether more neutral referees should be chosen for the Olympics, Bilyaletdinov said: 'We don't appoint the referees, a board of referees appoints them, so we can only take the situation as a given.'

The U.S. went on to win the match thanks to T.J. Oshie scoring four times in the shootout.

Jumping the gun: Russia celebrates a goal in the third period, but the score was eventually disallowed because the net was displaced

Advance: The U.S. team went on to win the match against Russia 3-2 and will compete in the quarterfinals in two days

The International Ice Hockey Federation later defended Meier's decision saying the rulings made by the two referees 'was the correct call and that the proper procedure had been followed with regards to the video review'.

That hasn't stopped Russians from voicing their anger online and in public protests in Moscow.

Many Russians fans have posted pictures of Meier on Twitter, with comments like 'Remember the face of the a**h***' and 'We will not forget this face'.

The threats were more direct in Moscow on Monday when Russians fans gathered outside the American Embassy to protest Meier's call.

Some of the fans participated in a Russian sports tradition of shredding soap, which is meant to symbolize killing someone and rendering their fat to make soap. The other interpretation is the soap used on a noose in a hanging.

While that sounds like a death threat, the fans insist it is light-hearted.

'Please don't take it as a death threat,' Dmitry Chesnokov, writer for Puck Daddy, told Yahoo Sports.

The Russians have not yet been knocked out of the tournament. They are scheduled to go up against Finland Tuesday and team USA will compete in the quarterfinals the day after.
