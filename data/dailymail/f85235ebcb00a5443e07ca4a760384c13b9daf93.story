Many STD's are curable and all of them are treatable - but most people don't even know realize they are infected or, more commonly, are afraid to have it checked.

And that's what First Derm is hoping to capitalize on.

Eliminating the arduous process of booking an appointment, going to the doctors, dropping your pants and anxiously awaiting results, the new app allows users to anonymously send a photo of their problem parts and receive a diagnosis within 24 hours from a certified dermatologist.

According to TechCrunch, the startup has had 10,000 downloads since launching in January and has delivered 4,000 diagnoses.

Too shy to show the doctor? A new dermatological app allows users to anonymously send photos of a skin condition - from potential STD's to warts - to a doctor and receive a response within 24 hours. The service costs $40 each time

Users submit an online form that includes some details of the affected area, as well as two pictures

The form is sent off without any personal information, such as email or Facebook log-in

First Derm guarantees a reply from a certified dermatologist within 24 hours, with most responses reportedly coming within a few hours

Users fill out an online form via their smartphone or android and then upload two pictures - one close up and one from far away - of the affected area.

One form costs $40.

While the app is not restricted to STDs - with warts, moles and other skin conditions one might typically seek help for all welcome - they are among the bulk of submissions.

Founder Alexander Borve told the website that 70 percent of their queries are 'below the waist'.

The First Derm homepage claims over 70 percent of conditions can be treated with over-the-counter medications and 30 percent recommend someone gets professional treatment.

They guarantee a response within 24 hours, with most coming in a matter of hours.

The app does not ask for any personal information.

It was first launched in Sweden in 2009 specifically to service STDs.

The app started in Sweden specifically to treat STDs, but has since relaunched as a broader dermatological service so as not to isolate their market

The company that owns it, iDoc24 - which lists its owners as Sebastian Suchanowski, Nick Hu and Alexander Borve - then decided to rebrand it, believing a 'STD app' was isolating them from certain consumers.

They brought on more dermatologists specializing in other areas and relaunched as First Derm.

News of the app coincides with a BBC report of a Los Angeles study, which found gonorrhea and chlamydia were more common in gay men using apps such as Tinder and Grindr than in those meeting in clubs or online.
