For a decade Vancouver reigned unchallenged as the best place to live in the world.

But the Canadian city has finally been toppled by Melbourne, Australia, in the twice-annual list produced by the Economist's Intelligence Unit.

In fact, Vancouver, known for its spectacular natural beauty and relaxed West Coast way of life, has been relegated to third place, with Vienna, Austria, taking the second spot.

Top spot: Melbourne narrowly edged out Vienna and Vancouver as the best city in the world to live in, according to The Economist

Melbourne, the second most populous city in Australia, was ranked highly for factors such as transport and education

The list ranks 140 cities on factors based on stability, health care, culture and environment, education and infrastructure.

But following almost a decade at the top, increased congestion may have led to Vancouver losing its crown.

And the Canadian city could be in for more bad news, as the list was compiled before widespread rioting in the city in June, meaning its stock could fall further in future rankings.

Runner-up: The State Opera House in Vienna, which took second place in The Economist's list of best cities

Canada and Australia featured prominently in the top 10 best cities, with Toronto and Calgary fourth and fifth respectively, while Sydney was ranked sixth alongside Perth and Adelaide in eighth and ninth.

1. Melbourne, Australia 97.52. Vienna, Austria 97.43. Vancouver, Canada 97.34. Toronto, Canada 97.25. Calgary, Canada 96.66. Sydney, Australia 96.17. Helsinki, Finland 968. Perth, Australia 95.99. Adelaide, Australia 95.910. Auckland, New Zealand 95.7

The only European cities to make the top 10 were Vienna, in second spot, and Helsinki, Finland, which was ranked seventh.

The Economist's system scores cities from 0-100 on 30 factors spread across the five areas.

The cities at the top of the list are typically ranked very close together as figures for the five areas are usually very high.

The first 63 cities in the table (down as far as Santiago in Chile) are all considered to occupy the top tier of liveability.

It is thought that cities which do well in the list often share common factors, and are usually mid-sized cities in wealthier countries with a lower population density.

London and New York were ranked at 53rd and 56th respectively in the list, the same positions as six months ago.

The two cities were let down by their perceived threat of terrorism and the rates of violent and petty crime.

London's ranking could also be set to drop following the recent riots across the city.

Jon Copestake, editor of the report, said despite London's lower ranking, it is unlikely to fall below the 80 per cent score below which cities are classed as 'poor' to live.

Mr Copestake told MailOnline: 'Places like London, Paris and New York are almost victims of their own success because they are so popular and so many people go there.

'The amount of people which go to these places means they burden the infrastructure of those cities.

'To say people in Vancouver are disappointed to be ranked third is a massive understatement, judging by some of the emails I've received from Canadians today.

'It was only 0.2 per cent from the top though and is still a city with no major problems at all.'

The lower population in cities can lead to a greater variety of recreation activities, as well as lower petty and violent crime rates or overburdened infrastructure.

Increased congestion in Vancouver may have led to it being toppled from the top of the list, although authors of the report state the recent closure of the Malahat Highway on Vancouver Island was not the sole reason for the city's fall from grace.

Civil unrest in Arab states saw several countries slide in the rankings.

The most pronounced dip was Libya, 
which slipped 28 places from 107 to 135 out of 140, just above Lagos in 
Nigeria and Algiers, Algeria.

The lowest ranking cities on the list were Dhaka, Bangladesh at 139, and Harare, Zimbabwe in 140th place.

Vancouver, which has topped the list for nearly a decade, was said to have been let down by increased congestion
