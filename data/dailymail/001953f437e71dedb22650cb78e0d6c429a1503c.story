Britain’s ‘young’ universities are now rated as among the best in the world by international analysts.

The seven UK institutions are in the global ‘50 under 50’ - a list of the top universities that have only been going since 1963 across the whole of the planet.

And it shows that it is not just the older seats of learning such as Cambridge, Oxford, Durham and London that the rest of the world looks at with admiration.

Warwick University is one of seven British universities which are in the global ¿50 under 50¿ - a list of the top institutions that have only been going since 1963 across the whole of the planet

Two British universities, Warwick and Lancaster, make the top ten while five others, Brunel, Bath, Aston, Essex and Loughborough are in the places below in the QS University Rankings.

Asian universities dominate the top of the list, making up five of the top six places and an indication of how the balance is changing across the globe.

Warwick, in third place, breaks up the Asian domination.

Warwick along with Lancaster, make the top ten while five others, Brunel, Bath, Aston, Essex and Loughborough are in the places below in the QS University Rankings

Australia, with nine, is the only single country with more establishments in the 50 than Britain’s impressive standing.

1 The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Hong Kong - 1991)2 Nanyang Technological University (Singapore - 1991)3 The University of Warwick (GB - 1964) 4 Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (Korea - 1971) 5 City University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong - 1984) 6 Pohang University of Science and Technology (Korea - 1986) 7 Maastricht University (Netherlands - 1976)8 University of California, Irvine (USA - 1965) 9 The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Hong Kong - 1994) 10 Lancaster University (GB - 1964)

International employment and education consultants QS, analysed data for the ‘young’ universities including their academic record and their reputation with firms and students.

Top of the overall list is the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology followed by Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University with Warwick in third.

Two more technology centres in Korea and one in Japan are also in the top ten, showing where the balance of power is heading, said QS experts.

Lancaster University is tenth in the list and only one American centre, The University of California, Irvine (UCI) makes the top 20.

Ben Sowter, head of the QS Intelligence Unit, said: 'Asian higher education is undergoing a rapid transformation, and Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Korea are at the forefront of the assault on the global academic elite.

'There are already 17 per cent more Asian universities in the Top 200 of the QS World University Rankings since the recession, and the next two decades could see leading US and European universities objectively overtaken.'

Europe still holds its own in the list, with 24 of the 50 but there are just four from North America.

And new universities also hold their own against their more established rivals as all 50 institutions are also in the global top 350 of all universities compiled by QS.
