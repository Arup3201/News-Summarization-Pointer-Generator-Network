Forget life on Mars.  The search for aliens is underway…in Yorkshire.

Scientists are scouring Britain’s deepest mine for bugs able to survive in the extreme conditions of the red planet.

The four-year probe could tell us what to look for on Mars – and where to find it.

It could also provide insight into 
whether life on Earth could have actually started on Mars – meaning we 
are all actually Martians.

Boulby, a working salt and potash mine near Whitby, is perfect for the project because the salty conditions mimic those on Mars which is covered in a layer of table salt.

The darkness that comes with being more than half a mile down is also key because many scientists believe that any life ‘on’ Mars is actually lurking deep beneath the surface.

Professor Charles Cockell, scientific co-ordinator of the £2 million ($3.3 million) MASE programme, said: ‘If we want to successfully explore Mars, we need to go to Mars-like places on Earth.

‘By looking underground at Boulby, we get an idea about the habitability and possibility of life on Mars.

‘There is nowhere else in the world with a permanent lab in a salty environment where you can do this kind of science.

‘So we have come to Yorkshire to understand Mars.’

The EU-funded scientists are sampling pools of brine in the mine for microbes, growing them in the lab and sequencing their DNA.

They also want to know how the sunlight-starved microbes get enough energy to survive and if they can cope with the high level of radiation found on Mars.

Answers to these questions will shed light on whether bacteria could live on our neighbouring planet – and where to find it.

For instance, if the sun and oxygen-starved bugs in the mine get their energy from iron and sulphur, the hunt could focus on places with these elements.

If there is life on Mars, scientists will want to know its origins.

One possibility is that life on Earth started on Mars and was carried here by microbes buried deep inside a meteorite.

Boulby Mine is located just south-east of the village of Boulby, on the north-east coast of the North York Moors in Redcar

Professor Cockell said: ‘There is absolutely no evidence for it but as a highly exploratory thought, you could go to Mars and look for Martian life and find that we have been Martians all along.’

If the bacteria at Boulby can survive the levels of radiation bugs would be exposed to travelling through space, the theory would seem more credible.

The mine, which has over 500 miles of tunnels under Yorkshire and Cleveland and extends seven miles under the sea, is also being used to test scientific instruments which are bound for Mars.

The technology could be adapted to improve detection and safety in mines.

Other projects at the Boulby Underground Laboratory include the search for dark matter, the invisible ‘glue’ that holds the universe together.

The scientists say the study of other planets helps us better understand life on Earth.

And it is essential if we are to understand our place in the universe.

Professor Cockell, of director of the UK Centre for Astrobiology at Edinburgh University, said: ‘There is a philosophical aspect to this.  Whether we are alone in the universe is a really basic science question.

‘You very rarely hear a seven year old ask its parents if they can explain the nitrogen cycle in the forest or the fundamental atomic structure of an atom.

‘But seven year olds do go to their parents and ask: “Is there anyone out there?”.

‘It is a rarity in human nature not to think about whether we are alone.  That is a very human question.’
