A desperate family is appealing for help raising the £200,000 needed to allow their son to have last-chance cancer treatment in the U.S.

Sam John, 16, was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour when he was just nine-years-old.

However, tests earlier this month revealed that the tumour has now started to grow, meaning his only chance is specialist radiation treatment only available in the U.S.

The treatment is not yet available in 
the UK so the family, from Fareham, Hants, is waiting to find out 
whether the NHS will pay for Sam to be treated abroad.

If their application is refused, they will have to find between £100,000 and £200,000 to pay for the proton beam therapy themselves.

Sam’s father has pledged to dedicate the rest of his life to helping other children in similar positions if his appeal is successful. 

Writing on his son’s Facebook fundraising page, Steve John, said: ‘The time for personal pride and ego has passed. I am hoping that by reaching out to you all, you might be able to support us in trying to offer Sam a future that’s as normal as possible.

‘Sam is going to get the best treatment there is to give him a future. That is not in question. How we make it happen is the challenge.

‘We’re currently all still reeling from the scale of the news we’ve received but we don’t have the luxury of time to waste. We have to act now.

‘If this appeal works, I’m prepared to dedicate the rest of my life to helping other children in similar positions.

‘We have to make this work for Sam and we've got just over two months to find the money.’

Until his diagnosis seven years ago, Sam was a perfectly healthy nine-year-old.

However, his family was then given the devastating news that he had a brain tumour.

The tumour itself is one of the less dangerous types that can often be treated very successfully with surgery.

However, Sam was unlucky. His tumour is in one of the worst possible places - on his midbrain at the top of his brain stem - making even partial removal impossible without catastrophic consequences.

Mr John,  44, explained that during the past seven years, Sam has been fighting his condition daily, enduring many surgical procedures, infections, countless blood transfusions and even post-operative meningitis as well as the permanent effects of the tumour.

He explains that his son also endured a two year course of chemotherapy which successfully slowed the progression of the tumour.

Mr John wrote: ‘There are some lasting side effects of his condition and from the cruel chemotherapy regime, but due to his personal strength, Sam brushes those aside and battles on with his life, thriving in school and making the most of every day.

‘Sam has a close circle of friends who are very supportive, helping him live a full and varied life. He studies hard and is looking forward to successful GCSE results this summer.

‘He's doing really well and is on course for getting As and Bs.’

Sam's best chance of a normal future is proton beam therapy in the U.S. He is pictured here (left) with his mother, Vicki, and his brother, Matthew

However, recent scans have shown that the tumour has become more active and that there are large cysts developing around it.

Sam’s doctors have recommended that he has radiation treatment but the family are torn as there are potentially severe side effects.

The treatment has a good chance of being able to render Sam’s tumour dormant and may result in no further treatment for that tumour – ever.

However, because of where Sam’s tumour is, radiation treatment is very dangerous. Healthy parts of his brain would be exposed harmful radiation.

Mr John explained that this could affect everything from his vision to his hearing, motor function and memory.

On top of this, the tumour is near Sam’s pituitary gland and if this is damaged he could suffer problems with growth, thyroid function, metabolism, sex hormones and blood pressure.

However, in the U.S. a more advanced treatment – known as proton beam therapy – is available.

It allows the radiation to be targeted directly at the tumour meaning that healthy surrounding tissue is not damaged.

Sam’s family believe that this is the best option for him.

Proton beam therapy is a type of radiotherapy.It uses a high energy beam of protons rather than X-rays to deliver a dose of radiotherapy for cancer patients.It is particularly effective for treating tumours at the base of the skull or in the spine.It directs all of the radiation directly to the tumour meaning there is minimal damage caused to surrounding healthy tissue.This means that it usually causes a lot fewer side effects than are associated with other forms of radiotherapy.Proton beam therapy is not currently available in the UK but the NHS will send some patients overseas for treatment.The treatment will be available in the UK from 2017.
