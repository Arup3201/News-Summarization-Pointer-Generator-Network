A toddler lost her mother and three relatives when their car crashed on the way home from a trip to the seaside.

Holly Hind, 18 months, was the sole survivor when her great-uncle Martyn Pugh’s car was in a pile-up with a fuel tanker and a van.

Her 28-year-old mother, Alison, Mr Pugh, 47, and his partner’s elderly parents, John and Margaret Kehoe, all died.

They were returning home on the A44 in Mid Wales following a trip to the seaside at Aberystwyth. The road was named last year as one of the worst in the country for accidents and fatalities. Mr Pugh’s Ford Focus collided head-on with a Scania fuel lorry between the villages of Llangurig and Ponterwyd at around 3pm on Tuesday.

The driver of a Ford Transit van that crashed into the back of their car escaped uninjured as did the lorry driver.

But the four adults in the Ford were killed. Holly, who was strapped into a child seat, was airlifted to hospital in Cardiff.

Although she suffered serious head injuries she is expected to survive. Her father, 36-year-old mechanic Steve Hughes, is at her bedside. The incident led to a 21-mile stretch of the road being closed for 12 hours.

Yesterday Holly’s great-grandfather, Emrys Davies, 80, said: ‘The police came for Steve and he is in Cardiff with Holly in hospital. We are all just hoping she will be okay.’

Lynn Kehoe, 39, was last night said to be devastated.

Neighbour Alan Crisp said: ‘She was very tearful. She has lost both her parents and her partner at the same time so we are all feeling for her. I have known Martyn for many years – he and his family are nice people.Martyn was the full-time carer for Lynn’s dad who was in a wheelchair and was quite ill. He was only able to go out if Martyn took him.’

Councillor Gareth Morgan said their village of Llanidloes in Mid Wales was in shock.

He has called on the Welsh Government to carry out an urgent review of the A44, which is the main road from the Midlands to the west coast of Wales.

‘It is a dreadful shock,’ he said. ‘I often saw Martyn with the little girl walking their chocolate Labrador. She is a lovely child. The accident was at a real blackspot, one of the most dangerous stretches of road in Wales. Fatal accidents have happened there far too frequently.

‘Accident statistics tell you in black and white that it is a very dangerous road; scenic but deadly.

‘The Welsh Government have made minor improvements to the highway but there is now an urgent need for a strategic review of that road, before more lives are lost.’

He added: ‘This will have a devastating effect on Llanidloes – we are a small community where we all care for each other. For four lives to be wiped out in an instant like this is very difficult to comprehend.’

Last night a spokesman for Dyfed Powys Police said that Holly remained in a serious but stable condition in hospital.

He confirmed the names of the deceased and added: ‘Our thoughts and sympathies are with the family at this incredibly difficult time.

‘Next of kin are being kept informed and are being supported by specialist officers.’

The eldest child of Mr Hughes and Miss Hind, Ethan, six, was at school at the time of the crash.
