Britons went Christmas crazy yesterday, spending £600million on a record Cyber Monday - but thousands found themselves frozen out of the frenzy by bank errors that left them unable to access their cash.

Shoppers are thought to have made at least 7.7million purchases, including 4.1million from Amazon's website alone, despite problems with RBS and Natwest accounts which left eager consumers unable to spend their money and, in a few cases, finding that their funds had completely vanished.

The errors, however, did little to dampen the spirits of online retailers like Amazon, which beat last year's sales record of 3.5million items by 600,000. On average, 47 orders were placed every second.

'Busiest online shopping day': These pictures show a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the Amazon Distribution Centre in Rugeley, Staffordshire, on Cyber Monday. Shoppers made 4.1million Amazon orders yesterday

Race against time: Staff at the 80,000 sq ft warehouse raced around to keep up with orders yesterday - roughly 47 every second

The first Monday in December – 
nicknamed Cyber or Mega Monday – has been identified as the busiest 
online shopping day of the year. One credit card provider alone 
predicted customers would spend a staggering £450million over the 
internet by midnight – 16 per cent up on last year.

Visa
 Europe said this was the equivalent of £312,500 a minute. John Lewis 
reported a glut of online shoppers, with the most popular purchases 
being clothes, tablet computers and Ugg footwear.

A
 spokesman said its distribution centre in Milton Keynes processed 
around 6,000 items an hour, adding: ‘The iPad Air is the best selling 
gift for the fourth week in a row.’

Today the Royal Mail was deluged with 
work in the aftermath of Cyber Monday, with its single largest centre 
processing 460,000 packages an hour.

Huge: Parcels are here directed down shoots to be sent to their destinations as they roll off just one loops of a ten-mile conveyed belt at the Royal Mail's Worldwide Distribution Centre in West London

The
 Worldwide Distribution Centre, near Heathrow Airport, is as large as 
six football pitches and features an enormous conveyer belt, which 
carries parcaels for ten miles before they are loaded into vans to be 
delivered.

The
 number of shoppers going online overshadowed Black Friday last week,
 when high street retailers slashed prices to copy American sales the 
day after Thanksgiving. Amazon then saw 4million orders placed, which was a record at the time but has already been surpassed.

Working hard: 400 staff members put a range of goods from electrical items to children's clothes into packages at the warehouse

On their way! Purchases were then put into packages ready for distribution from the centre - one of eight owned by Amazon around the country

Big spenders: Yesterday was Amazon's biggest ever day of sales in the UK

An Amazon spokesman said: 'Cyber Monday has
continued to grow every year with more people looking online to find and buy
the perfect Christmas gifts. Black Friday really captured the imagination of customers
as shown by the fact that we had our busiest day to date and reached one-day
sales of over 4million items for the very first time in our history.

'Customers
were then out in force again yesterday, shopping for Christmas presents and
generating our busiest day of sales ever.'

Consumer analysts Experian estimated that 113million visits were made to online retail websites yesterday.

A 
record £1 in every £5 will be spent online this Christmas, with the 
proportion of all retail internet sales, excluding food, hitting an 
all-time high of 19.9 per cent.

Mammoth: The Amazon warehouse is 800,000 sq ft - the same size as 20 large supermarkets lined up together, with staff using fork lift trucks to get around

Total internet sales in November were up 16 per cent in a year, according to figures from the British Retail Consortium, and Barclaycard analysts said they expect 10.1 per cent more online shopping this year than in 2012.

Britons
 will do more Christmas shopping online than any other nation, with 88 
per cent buying at least one gift on the web. 

The average consumer will
 spend eight hours researching and buying presents online, according to
 analysts Experian. Such is the rise of the web that it accounts for a 
quarter of all fashion and lingerie sales and almost a third of shoes 
and furniture.

Retailers made reductions of up to 68 per cent yesterday during 24-hour Cyber Monday sales.

House
 of Fraser offered 40 per cent off some lines, while M&S ran a One 
Day Spectacular with savings of 20 per cent on fashion and lingerie. The
 Boots event included ‘better than half price’ savings.

Debenhams
 had 50 per cent-plus savings on ten ‘hot offers’, while Gap took 40 per
 cent off everything.

BRC director general, Helen Dickinson, said: ‘More
 of us will be clicking into Christmas than ever.’

Festive spending: Retailers predict that Christmas sales will be worth £72.2billion this year, with a third spent online at stores like Amazon

Under control: The company has hired 15,000 more staff, with Royal Mail also setting up temporary distribution centres, for the festive rush
