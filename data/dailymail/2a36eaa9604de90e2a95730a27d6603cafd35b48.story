As Google Glass becomes more widely available, the company has decided to host a number of events across the country to try and reassure people that are wary about the device.

Google put its controversial eyewear on sale to the public for the first time last month but most people haven't had chance to see one, let alone use it.

The firm offered its 'explorer edition', the $1500 test version of the eyewear, for general sale as the firm prepares to introduce the 'real' consumer version of the headware in the coming months.

Glass Night Out or meetup events are being held this evening in eight cities: Boston; Los Angeles; Madison, Milwaukee; New York; Orlando, Palo Alto and Washington, D.C.

Trendy? Glass wearers are planning meetups in a series of Glass Night Out events across the country Saturday

'This Saturday night, you and Glass are going out! Explorers across the US are getting together to mingle, snack, and cheers for the first Glass Night Out,' the company wrote in a Google+ posting.

'In the words of +JR Curley, these events are part of a community initiative to have a formal Explorer meet up, team with local businesses, and help dispel Glass myths to all.'

Those who currently own the device paid $1,500 to be part of the development process, exchanging ideas on improvements to the design and function in return for the coveted device.

With the release of the second-generation, those already enrolled in the Google Explorer program  were able to 'invite' three of their friends to the scheme.

Google is hoping its Explorer faithful will help 'dispel Glass myths to all'

Google
 recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass 
wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude'
 for wearing the device.

The
 firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and 
warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much.

The
 guide comes as Google is expanding the number of people who have the 
$1500 prototypes, ahead of an expected release later this year.

'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said.

'Since the program started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about.

'Reactions
 range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do 
they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see 
into my soul?!'

Reaction to the new design has been mixed, with some critics saying changes to the device looked bulky.

Google
 has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has 
developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses,
 and partnered with Ray-Ban to develop fashionable frames.

The 'Glass Night Out' is part of a continued effort to reduce the polarizing effect of the glass headsets, which let users snap photos, shoot video, perform a search and do lots of other smartphone-like tasks in front of their eyes.

The idea of a computer and recording device on one's head has made some non-Glass users uncomfortable, and it has pushed the conversation about etiquette and social norms in a connected world.

Establishments including bars and movie theaters have kicked out Explorers (whom critics call 'Glassholes').

In February, Google released an etiquette guide explaining how users can avoid being labeled a 'Glasshole' when strutting around with the headware.

The company followed up with a post in March about the "top 10 myths" about Glass, which include the idea that Glass is always recording.
