A prominent veterinarian was gunned down by her estranged husband in their home before he took his own life, authorities said.

Karen Hamilton Gunn, 44, and husband Graham Gunn, 56, were found dead in the backyard of their Texas home – authorities believe their two young children may have witnessed the crime.

The apparent murder-suicide sent shock waves through the Woodlands community, which was in the middle of its Memorial Day observation.

According to the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office, the shootings began sometime after 4pm in the backyard of their home, located in a cul-de-sac of an affluent subdivision of large brick houses and landscaped plots.

The Houston Chronicle reports that the couple’s daughter rushed to the house of a neighbour after the shootings, saying her mother and father were shot. The neighbour placed a call to 911.

The paper reported that Gunn, an employee of Logoworks by HP, parked his car nearby and entered the back yard.

Ms Gunn was the owner of Veterinary Medical Centre and was known by her neighbours as the trustworthy caretaker for their pets. 

The couple, married in 1997, had two children, a boy and a girl.

But their marriage experienced trouble, and sources told the Chronicle that Graham brought a gun to his wife’s veterinary offices last year, causing her to file a protective order against him.

Court records show that she had filed for divorce last November, and the two were scheduled to appear in court next week.

Montgomery County Detective Dan Zietek told KHOU that the department’s investigation shows Graham shot and killed his estranged wife.

‘From all indication of our investigation at this point,’ he said, ‘(Graham) shot his wife then shot himself.’

One neighbour, who requested not to be identified, told the station: ‘It’s very selfish of the…man. Within a second or two, his two kids are parentless.’
