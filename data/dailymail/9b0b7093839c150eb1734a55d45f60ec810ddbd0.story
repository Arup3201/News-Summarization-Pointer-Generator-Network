Zara Phillips is back in the saddle a week on from her first contest since giving birth to baby Mia.

The new mother galloped to ninth place last weekend at the Symm International Horse Trials in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.

Between trials, the Olympic silver medallist was seen cradling her three-month-old, the Queen's fourth great-grandchild.

Going for gold: Zara Phillips is ramping up her fitness regime with her second competition in a week after her break

But today, she appeared to have her eyes on the prize as she arrived alone to Biston, East Devon.

Zara, the 2006 world champion, quit competitive riding last July after announcing her pregnancy.

She has since revealed she has her sights set on the elusive gold medal - and her journey starts now.

Competing today against 200 others riders, the royal showed she is fighting her way back to peak fitness as she tore through fields and water jumps.

Despite an eight-month break, she looked at ease astride her horses CG Master Lux and Mr Murt, taking part in the dressage, show jumping, and cross-country trials.

The last-minute event in East Devon was devised when nearby Withington unexpectedly cancelled its annual contest.

Organisers made a desperate plea for a minimum of 200 people to sign up - and Zara responded within minutes.

Zara was seen riding High Kingdom around her mother's Gloucestershire home in the days running up to last week's event - which ran across the Easter weekend.

It is believed she was riding around Princess Anne's Gatcombe Park to practice for the event.

Speaking earlier this month, the 32-year-old told the BBC she felt 'comfortable' being back in the saddle.

She said: 'I am much more comfortable now. When I first got back on it was nice to get back in the saddle but you're not very stable as your muscles aren't working well.

'Then I went skiing at six weeks which you could think was crazy. Actually after that I was probably 50 per cent fitter than I would have been if I had stayed at home training for a week.'

Zara became the first royal to win an Olympic medal at the London 2012 games as part of the British eventing team.

The competitor has said she wants to take part in the 2016 Brazil games - and that she is aiming for gold.

She told BBC Breakfast's Sally Nugent: 'I definitely want a gold. It would be fantastic to go to another Olympics.

'Unfortunately, it's every four years so you've got to try to stay at the top level and have good results.'

Zara told the BBC she was enjoying motherhood, adding: 'I have really enjoyed it.

'Getting your body back is the hardest. But I'm lucky - she's been great she has been sleeping and eating so I think I am very lucky.'

Zara, who is married to former England rugby player Mike Tindall, gave birth to baby Mia at the end of January. Mia is the Queenâ€™s fourth great-grandchild - and is 16th in line to the throne.

Earlier this month, Tindall's horse Monbeg Dude - which he co-owns and was part trained by Zara - came seventh in the Grand National.
