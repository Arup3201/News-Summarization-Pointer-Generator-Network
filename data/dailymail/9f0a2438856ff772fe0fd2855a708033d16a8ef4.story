Victim: Keith Murrain is believed to have been killed within hours of arriving in Jamaica

A prominent British businessman who was kidnapped shortly after arriving in Jamaica has been found dead with his throat slit.

The body of Keith Murrain, 54, was discovered in a shallow grave in a remote sugarcane field outside Spanish Town, which has been dubbed the murder capital of Jamaica.

The Birmingham-based businessman arrived on the island on Friday but was abducted and bundled into a waiting vehicle as he left Kingston's Norman Manley Airport.

Mr Murrain, who lived in Edgbaston, is believed to have been killed within hours of being kidnapped.

The father-of-three's body was found in a sugarcane field outside Spanish Town less than 24 hours later.

Mr Murrain's close friend Howard Reid, a Birmingham barrister, said: 'Whoever did this are scum, filth, savages and I hate them. I curse them, I really, really do.'

''The savagery, the lack of humanity, the coldness... To look a man in the eye and cut his throat. I really do hate them,' he added.

Mr Murrain was travelling away from the capital Kingston's Norman Manley Airport in a hire car when he was abducted and bundled into a waiting vehicle.

It was unclear whether he was robbed before he was killed.

Mr Murrain had built a thriving business exporting engineering parts to Jamaica and Trinidad.

He was a regular visitor to the island, where he reportedly had a home in the gated Caribbean Estates Community, said to boast 'Fort Knox-esque security'.

Reports from the island said police were following up several leads over the killing, but his family in Aston said they could not understand why he had been murdered.

Mr Murrain's mother Josephine, along with his three brothers and two sisters, are being comforted by West Midlands Police liaison officers.

One sister, Jenifer Murrain, said: 'We, as a family, want justice. Why kill him? Why not just rob him? I want the people who did this to hang'.

'What happened to Keith will have a major impact on people doing business or going on holiday to Jamaica,' she added.

Everyone knew Keith and everyone looked up to him. He was the life and soul of the party. When his body is brought back, it will be the biggest funeral Birmingham has ever seen,' she went on to say.

Mr Murrain's mother, originally from the Caribbean island of Montserrat, is now trying to fly to Jamaica with her son's former partner.

She has been in contact with the British High Commission in Kingston, which has pledged to provide police protection during her time in the Caribbean.

In 2005, Jamaica - which retains the death penalty - had the world's highest murder rate, with 1,674 killings: a staggering 58 per 100,000 people.

In 2011, the island, with a population of 2.7million, endured 1,124 murders, 1,322 shootings, 738 rapes and 3,033 robberies, the US Bureau of Diplomatic Security revealed.

Following the killing, a senior officer in Jamaica's police force urged those flying back to the island to be careful who they inform of their journey.

'Crimes committed against people returning to the island are often organised by people who know them and the time and date of their return,' he added.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: We are aware of the death of a British national in Jamaica and are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time'.
