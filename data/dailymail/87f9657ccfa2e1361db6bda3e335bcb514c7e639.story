50 Cent is among the famous friends grieving the death of hip hop mogul Chris Lighty and the rapper has now agreed to bankroll a private probe into the 44-year-old's apparent suicide.

Lighty, who had managed Sean 'Diddy' combs, L.L. Cool J and Missy Elliott among others, died on August 30 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head after he reportedly argued with his wife at his home in the affluent Bronx, New York neighborhood of Riverdale.

The New York Medical Examiner has ruled the death a suicide but Lighty's family is suspicious of the circumstances leading up to his death and have asked the Grammy winner to pay for the inquiry.

Mourning: 50 Cent leaves the funeral service for producer Chris Lighty in New York City on September 5

50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III, told WNYW-TV on Monday he can't believe that Lighty would have killed himself because the music exec, who started Violator record label and management company, was set to rake in millions of dollars for a 50 Cent tour he had just booked for 2013.

'To be honest with you, there was too much planning to move forward to accept right away that he just shot himself,' the rapper told the local news station.

Lighty's wife Veronica, was named as the primary beneficiary and executor of Lighty's will. Lighty's children will also benefit through a $1.6 million trust.

'It’s a world divided. Even at the funeral, Veronica sat on one side in the front with her kids and her family, and the Lighty family was on the other,' sources told the New York Post's Page Six about the hostility between his family and widow.

'A lot of people want answers; a lot of things don’t really add up,' another source said.

Surprised: 50 Cent spoke out on Monday about his shock over Chris Lighty's death

Veronica married the music manager in 2003 and they had two children together. But the couple's relationship was said to be rocky and she filed for divorce in 2011 but later retracted papers to dissolve the marriage. 

After her husband's death, the 36-year-old intimated that her husband owed the IRS money, through a friend speaking to the press on her behalf, and maintained that she and her husband had not been fighting in the lead up to his death.

'No smart man is going to leave his children for fighting with his wife,' she told the New York Daily News in early September.

'We had a passionate relationship. We fought all the time,' urging people to leave the matter alone, 'let him die proud, at peace.'

On the afternoon of Saturday, August 30, Lighty allegedly walked into the backyard of his Riverdale home after he had been arguing with Veronica, only stating, 'I'm tired of this.'

He then shot himself with a 9-mm. handgun, sources said.

But Lighty's family is pushing for more information on what contributed to his death and even commissioned a second autopsy, conducted by former New York medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden.

He said the results from his examination are still inconclusive.

'In my opinion, the cause of death was clear as a gunshot wound to the head. The manner of death, acts of suicide or homicide, still is pending until all those tests are done,' he told the New York TV station.

In addition to the autopsy, Lighty's mother approached 50 Cent about organizing a deeper  investigation into the shocking death.

She hired lawyer Scott Leemon and private investigator Les Levine to oversee the probe.

'The
investigation is being led by private investigator Les Levine and is 
in its’ extreme early stages. It is being initially funded by 50 Cent 
with the hope of others helping,' Scott E. Leemon told 
AllHipHop.com about the case.

The rapper said he felt he needed to do all he could to help the family through this difficult time.

'I couldn't tell her no. She kind of needed closure. There were so many gray areas,' 50 Cent said about his contribution.

The
37-year-old entertainer had worked closely with Lighty throughout his 
career and was credited with helping orchestrate 50 Cent's highly 
lucrative endorsement deal with Vitamin Water.

'He's been a part of everything that I can make reference as a successful moment for me,' he said of Lighty.
