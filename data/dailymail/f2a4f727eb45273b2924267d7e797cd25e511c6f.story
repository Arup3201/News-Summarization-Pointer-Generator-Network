Tottenham once offered to sell Gareth Bale to German side Hamburg in a £5million deal, former Spurs boss Martin Jol has revealed.

Jol, who was in charge of the Bundesliga club during the 2008-09 season, says Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy offered the then teenage prodigy to him after the club grew frustrated at his inconsistent performances and series of injury problems.

It was the Dutchman who helped lure the Wales star to the club in a £7million deal from Southampton in 2007, during his time in the White Hart Lane hotseat.

Bale's raw potential eventually became realised at Spurs during his six seasons at the club.

Initally bought as a left back, Bale grew into a maurading left winger that saw Spanish giants Real Madrid sign him in record-breaking £85m where he won the Champions league in his debut season.

However Jol told talkSPORT, Bale's outcome at Spurs could have a lot different.

'Spurs saw Bale as a left back, but he probably wasn’t the best left-back in the world,' he said.

'He was more creative, he had electric pace, so everybody saw that he was more suited as a forward player, and Harry Redknapp saw that later on.

"I saw his potential straight away, but other people didn’t see that in the early stages of his career and that led to Spurs offering Bale to me when I went to Hamburg.

'We had to pay a lot of money to get him though, about five or six million, which we couldn’t afford at the time.

'I then asked Daniel Levy if we could take him on loan instead, but at that time it was not possible.

'So yes, Hamburg could have bought Bale for £5million because, of course, he was not playing at that moment.

'He couldn’t get into the side, so Spurs offered him to other clubs.'
