Holograms have featured in futuristic sci-fi films for decades, from Star Wars to Minority Report and Prometheus, but Apple could be about to make the technology mainstream - and small enough to fit in your pocket. 

New Apple patent files detail a display that appears to float 3D images, or holograms, above it, and these holograms can then be moved using finger gestures.

The process involves a system that creates the 3D image, an optical system that puts this image into the air, and a touch sensor.

The patent details a display that appears to float 3D images, or holograms, above it and these holograms can then be moved using finger gestures and swipes. Patent drawing pictured. It involves a system that creates the 3D image, an optical system that puts this image into the air, and an optical or acoustic sensor

According to the application, the 
hologram is created using infrared lasers - or similar device - that 
project the image onto a surface above the display.  

This projection would then appear via 
the optical system, which could be situated between two parabolic or 
concave mirrors that have reflective surfaces facing each other.

When
 infrared light beams strikes an external object, such as the user’s 
finger, the files explain that the light will be reflected towards a 
series of sensors.

These optical sensors could include images sensors, cameras or other light-based sensors.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published the ‘Interactive three-dimensional display system,’ patent on Thursday and it was found by Apple Insider.  

According to the application, the hologram is created using infrared lasers - or similar devices - that project the image onto a surface above the display.

The files said: ‘If desired, there may be one, two, three, four, or more than four projectors in [the] display system.

‘Each projector may include a single monochromatic laser, may include multiple monochromatic lasers of the same colour, or may include multiple monochromatic lasers of different colours such as a red, green, and blue for producing colour images.’

This projection would then appear via the optical system, which could be situated between two parabolic or concave mirrors that have reflective surfaces facing each other.

Apple's patented system is slightly different to the 3D display Amazon is rumoured to be working on. The first pictures of Amazon's 3D handset were revealed last week, pictured, and appeared to feature four cameras and retina-tracking technology that are used to create a 'floating screen' effect

When infrared light beams strike an external object, such as the user’s finger, the files explain that the light will be reflected towards a series of sensors.

These optical sensors could include images sensors, cameras or other light-based sensors.

The files also state acoustic-based ultrasonic sensors or capacitive sensors could work to locate and track the movement of the finger so the 3D 'floating' object can be fully manipulated.

Amazon is similarly said to be working on a 3D display for an upcoming device, but its system is slightly different to the one Apple has patented.

The first pictures of Amazon's 3D handset, revealed last week, appeared to feature four cameras used to create the 'floating screen' effect.

Set to be unveiled in June, the device is rumoured to use retina-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to 'float above the screen like a hologram and appear three-dimensional at all angles.'
