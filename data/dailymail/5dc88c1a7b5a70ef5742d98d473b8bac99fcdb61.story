An extremely rare sculpture that captured the essence of a postwar world is set to fetch at least $100 million in New York next month as the city's art market looks set for another blockbuster season.

Alberto Giacometti's Chariot, conceived and cast in 1950, is a five-foot bronze and wood sculpture of an elongated female figure perched on a chariot with two large wheels.

It is one of 10 artworks that are slated to land $500 million for Sotheby's and Christie's at the Impressionist and modern art fair on November 4. 

Blockbuster: Alberto Giacometti's 1951 bronze sculpture Chariot is slated to land $100 million next month

Record: The Swiss artist's Walking Man sold for a record $104 million in 2010 at the height of the recession

Giacometti's masterpiece was seen by many as a symbol of the anxiety felt across the world following the Second World War, balancing between movement and stasis - though the Swiss artist said it was inspired by a 'glistening trolley cart'.

And auctioneers at Sotheby's insist they are confident it will match or surpass the world-record Giacometti sale of his Walking Man, which went for $104 million at the height of the recession in 2010.

It will go under the hammer alongside Amedeo Modigliani's Tete, which is slated to land $45 million.

Modigliani's two-foot-tall sculpture of a woman's head wearing a tribal mask with her hair swept back has never appeared at auction. 

The Italian artist carved the delicate piece between 1911 and 1912 using a block of limestone scavenged from a construction site in Paris.

Meanwhile, Christie's has announced a predicted $130 million sale for Andy Warhol's prints of Marlon Brando and Elvis.

The extremely rare sales have excited the market as it appears many see art as a worthwhile investment despite an uncertain economy.

'It's beyond belief,' said Suzanne Gyorgy, head of art advisory and finance at New York-based Citigroup Inc.'s Citi Private Bank. 

She told Bloomberg: 'We are still in the same cycle where tremendous wealth is being generated around the world and people are looking for hard assets like art and real estate.' 

Last November, a Francis Bacon triptych became the most expensive artwork sold at auction, fetching $142.4 million.

But with catalogues yet to be printed - and many artworks still yet to be confirmed - analysts predict similar excitement this fall.
