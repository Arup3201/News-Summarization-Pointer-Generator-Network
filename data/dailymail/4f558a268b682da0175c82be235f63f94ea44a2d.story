Suicide: Danielle Halverson, 50, of DeLand, was found dead on Monday

A Florida woman who killed a teenage girl in a hit-and-run incident in March has been found dead in an apparent suicide.

Danielle Halverson, 50, of DeLand, was charged with leaving the scene of a crash involving death after she lost control of her vehicle while reaching for her cell phone and fatally struck 14-year-old Juliana Hobbs.

On Monday morning, Ms Halverson's body was found in her South Ridgewood Avenue home. She is understood to have died of an overdose.

A friend of the woman had called the Volusia County Sheriff's Department requesting a welfare check after struggling to contact her.

He told police she'd seemed increasingly depressed lately and had made statements suggesting she was considering suicide.

Deputies and paramedics arrived at the scene and found Ms Halverson in her bedroom, unresponsive and without a pulse.

Paramedics began CPR and the woman was transported by ambulance to Florida Hospital-DeLand, where she was pronounced dead at 11:39 am, according to the Daytona Beach News Journal.

Sheriff's spokesman Gary Davidson said the death was being treated as a suicide as there was a lack of injury and the woman left a note, however he didn't reveal whether it referred to the March incident.

Ms Halverson had told Florida Highway Patrol she'd struck Ms Hobbs with her 2004 Toyota Corolla after losing control of her car while reaching for her cellphone.

According to her arrest report, she told police: 'I kind of feel stupid for saying this, but a cellphone was a little bit a part of it, trying to reach for it. I was the sole driver of the car. Yes, I'll admit that.'

The crash took place at around 8.40pm on March 17. Ms Hobbs' friend Rachel Russell, 14, was also injured but not seriously.

Police located Ms Halverson's car just days after the collision. On it they found DNA linking the vehicle to the crash, including Ms Hobbs' blood on the front bumper and Ms Hobbs' and Ms Russell's DNA on a portion of the windshield.

The woman was listed as a person of interest but wasn't arrested until October 16.

In addition to the hit-and-run charges, Ms Halverson had been charged with tampering with evidence.

Her boyfriend, James Hanna, 59, was charged with accessory after the fact, tampering or fabricating evidence and making fake reports to authorities earlier this month after allegedly lying to police about his girlfriend's whereabouts on the day of the crash.

On November 9, Ms Halverson was 
rearrested after failing to show up in court to have the hit-and-run 
charges read to her, according to court records.

DeLand police had to go to her South 
Ridgewood Avenue home and take her into custody after she did not show 
up for her arraignment the previous day.

A DeLand resident called 911 after Ms Halverson's Corolla hit the two girls and then sped off.

Elizabeth Hoefler, who lives two doors 
away from where the teens were struck, said her 18-year-old daughter 
made one of the frantic calls for help and tried to resuscitate Juliana Hobbs.

Ms Hoefler had had pizza delivered to her family the night the incident happened and was at home when she heard the collision, she told the West Volusia Beacon.

'I heard this car, and it did a total acceleration. Then, bam! There were no brakes, no screeching,' she said, adding that she initially thought a motorist had struck the family's mailbox.

'(My husband) ran out and said it wasn't our mailbox.'

Ms Hoefler said a pickup truck with two men had stopped in the road and were yelling 'Stop! Stop!'

She said she saw a silhouette and thought it might have been a dog, then she saw the outline of Juliana's tennis shoe.

'I went running up there. I could see Rachel. She was screaming 'They hit us! They aimed for us!''

Ms Hoefler said she held Rachel while her husband and daughter tried to perform CPR on Juliana.

'Juliana never moved,' said Ms Hoefler, who left to get Rachel's father, just three houses away.

'There was absolutely no screeching of tires, no brakes, just a total acceleration,' she added.

Ms Hobbs' sister described Ms Halverson's death as a tragic overdose.

'I was told it was an overdose of some sorts,' Courtney Meyer told the News Journal. 'I just feel numb right now. It's just a sad ending to a sad story.'
