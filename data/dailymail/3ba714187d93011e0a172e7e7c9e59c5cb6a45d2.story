A scientist who helped design the trigger mechanism for the atomic bombs used in the Second World War has died, at the age of 96.

Robert F Christy, a former California Institute of Technology (Caltech) professor, was one of the early recruits to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos Laboratory, a U.S. government research project to develop atomic weapons during the war.

However - during his research - he was never told the true purpose of the experiments, he later said.

He had been hand-picked to join by J. Robert Oppenheimer - his professor at the
University of California, Berkeley, with whom Christy studied quantum mechanics.

The Canadian native devised what came to be known as the Christy bomb or Christy gadget, a plutonium implosion device.

Christy died of natural causes at his home in Pasadena, surrounded by his family, according to Caltech spokeswoman Deborah Williams-Hedges.

According to a 1994 interview recorded in Caltech's archives, Vancouver-born Christy showed mathematical prowess early in his
schooling and skipped grades to graduate from the University of British
Columbia when he was 19.

Before the Manhattan Project began, Christy researched with the era's leading physicists, including Italian Enrico Fermi and Hungarian Eugene Wigner.

He said in the 1994 interview: 'What I was told was that they were trying to make a chain reaction.

'And the purpose of the chain reaction - well, it might be to drive submarines, or whatever. I was not told about bombs at the time.'

When the first bomb was tested at Los Alamos, Christy said everyone was pleased to have succeeded in the experiment, but a month later, when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, it was a very sobering experience.

He added: 'There had been bombs dropped on cities. There had been firestorms, and so forth. I believe people nowadays don't realise that in war your objective is to beat the enemy.

'And unfortunately, mostly that involves killing a lot of the enemy to do that. So war is a very bloody thing.

Later in life, Christy opposed the further development of nuclear weapons. He became a member of the National Research Council's committee on dosimetry

'I felt then that although this was a terrible event, it probably saved many, many more Japanese lives. They probably would have lost millions if they had had to defend themselves against an invasion.'

Later in life, Christy opposed the further development of nuclear weapons. He became a member of the National Research Council's committee on dosimetry, which studied the radiation effects of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.

Christy taught theoretical physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics at Caltech, going on to serve as faculty chair, vice president and provost, as well as acting president.

While at Caltech, he investigated pulsations in the brightness of stars, which are used to measure cosmic distances. Christy was awarded the Royal Astronomical Society's Eddington Medal for his work.

He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1965.

Caltech Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy Chair B. Thomas Soifer said that Christy was a major figure at the private university and a founder of a very important area of astrophysical research.

Soifer added: 'Bob was an outstanding theoretical physicist; his contributions to scientific research, to public policy and his leadership helped in shaping what Caltech is today.'

A joint effort between the U.S., the UK and Canada, the Manhattan 
Project was a research and development programme that produced the first
atomic bomb during the Second World War.

It began in 1939 as a modest operation, but grew to involve more than
130,000 people costing about $2billion working across 30 sites in 
America, Britain and Canada - some of them top secret.

The first-ever nuclear device was detonated in New Mexico on July 16 1945.

Less than a month later it was unleashed on unsuspecting Japan.

On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped a massive atomic bomb on
Hiroshima.

The equivalent of 20,000 tons of TNT, the a-bomb 
killed approximately 70,000 of civilians and flattened the city (pictured). Another 70,000 died from the effects of radiation with five years.

Three days later, another atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, which killed about 70,000 people.
