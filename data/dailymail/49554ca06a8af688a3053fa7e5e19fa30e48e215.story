Old school gamers rejoice - the humble Spectrum computer is back.

Sir Clive Sinclair has announced he is launching a modernised version of his hugely successful Spectrum products from the early 1980s.

Called the Sinclair Spectrum Vega, the computer has fewer buttons than the original, but will run thousands of the retro computer’s games.

The Sinclair Spectrum Vega is being sold by Luton-based Retro Computers.

‘The Sinclair Spectrum Vega takes advantage of major advances in technology to achieve big cost savings by replacing most of the electronics in the earlier products,’ said the firm.

The ZX Spectrum was released in April 1982.

It was the successor to Sir Clive Sinclair's ZX81 model and added high-resolution colour graphics and sound.

The computer was thinner than anything else available at the time and cost £125 ($195) for a basic model, with 16KB, or £175 ($274) for a 48k model. 

The Sinclair Spectrum Vega takes advantage of advances in technology to big cost savings by replacing most of the electronics in the earlier products, explained Retro Computers.

It uses a low cost micro-controller and software that combine to enable the Vega to run all of the games, 14,000 or more of them, which were developed for the original model. 

‘The Vega uses a low cost micro-controller and a clever piece of software that combine to enable the Vega to run all of the games, 14,000 or more of them, which were developed during the years when some 5 million of the original Sinclair Spectrum were being sold.’

This includes an early version of Sim City, Manic Miner, Boulder Dash, Treasure Island Dizzy and Elite, among others.

Development of the product is complete, and the firm has launched an Indiegogo campaign to fund production of the device.

It has currently raised £20,854 of its £100,000 goal, and the campaign will run until 30 January.

If successful, devices will ship internationally in April.

Limited edition versions of the computer are available from Indiegogo for £100 ($156), and shipping outside of the UK costs an extra £20 ($31).

The Vega has been developed by Chris Smith, a former ZX Spectrum games developer.

‘The Sinclair Spectrum Vega is as simple to use as any of the popular games consoles, but far less expensive,’  the firm added.

These games include an early version of Sim City, Manic Miner, Boulder Dash, Treasure Island Dizzy (pictured left) and Elite (pictured right), among others. The Vega additionally has ‘sufficient memory’ to allow the user to download other games that will be available from launch, for free

It plugs into a TV and will be sold with around 1,000 games built-in.

The Vega additionally has ‘sufficient memory’ to allow the user to download other games that will be available from launch, for free.

And, anyone who still has Spectrum games from the original series can load them onto the Vega using an SD card.
