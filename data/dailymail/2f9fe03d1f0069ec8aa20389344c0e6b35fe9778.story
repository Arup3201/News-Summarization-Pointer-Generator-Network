Jasmine Coleman, 12, has been found safe and well some 50 miles from her home 

A 12-year-old girl who went missing from her family home at 2am amid fears she was driven away by an 'older man' has been found safe and well. 

Jasmine Coleman was reported as missing this morning after disappearing from her home in Lancing, West Sussex. 

The child was found this afternoon following a police appeal some 50miles away in Croydon, south east London. 

Police feared she may have been driven to London by an older man when they launched an appeal for information this morning.  

The schoolgirl had not been seen since 11.30pm on Friday night. 

Sussex Police said she may have been talking with someone on FaceTime before disappearing at around 2am. 

The force launched a public appeal for information on her whereabouts on Saturday morning. 

In it, she was described as fair with long, blonde hair and as having possibly been wearing black riding trousers and a polo shirt or a Paisley pattern dress. 

On Saturday afternoon the force confirmed she had been found safe and well in Croydon but could not confirm the circumstances under which police located her. 

No one has been arrested in connection with her disappearance. 

Shortly after 4pm a spokesman said: 'Jasmine Coleman, the 12-year-old girl from Lancing reported missing from home during the early hours of Saturday (21 March) was found safe and well later the same day in Croydon. 

'Police would like to thank the media and members of the public for help given during efforts to trace her. '
