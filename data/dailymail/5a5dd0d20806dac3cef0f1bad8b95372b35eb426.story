A new survey from Birds Eye revealed that  53 per cent of us pick out foods we don't like from a meal

It appears that when it comes to food Britain is still home to some pretty fussy eaters.

According to a new poll anchovies are Britain's most hated taste followed by chicken livers and olives.

The survey conducted by Birds Eye found that despite the fact that 41 per cent of Britons would describe themselves as foodies, one in five will go to extreme lengths to avoid flavours they dislike.

More than half (53 per cent) admit picking food they don’t like out of their meal, while one in five (22 per cent) secretly feed the offending food to their dog.

Most Brits (66 per cent) are brave enough to give strange food a go at least once.

However, one in five (21 per cent) admit having more than seven foods on their 'hate' list.

The most hated on the list were anchovies with the salty fish being detested by almost half the nation (44 per cent). 

Other foods featuring in the top 10 most hated include olives (39 per cent), mushrooms (15 per cent) and salami (20 per cent).

Although we may be a nation of fussy eaters we are certainly are a polite population. 

More than half Britons (52 per cent) admitted they've forced themselves to tuck into food they dislike because they didn't want to upset their host.

However, it appears that the women are the more compassionate sex with three-quarters of them (78 per cent) choosing not to cause any hassle when served food they dislike as they don’t want to spoil the time they are spending with their friends and family, compared to only 57 per cent of men.

Prime suspects: The top three most hated foods include the salty fish - anchovies and olives 

A further one in 11 women (nine per cent) have even  gone as far as to stow food away in their handbag to avoid upsetting their host and disrupting a meal with family and friends.

Though it appears that there is a good reason for this. Women may be the more considerate guests but they are also the fussiest.

More than a quarter of the women polled (27 per cent) admitted they dislike seven or more common types of food, compared to just 16 per cent of men. 

A third of men (30 per cent) say there aren't any types of food that they particularly dislike, compared to only 19 per cent of women.

Cheryl Calverley, general marketing manager at Birds Eye, said that the research shows that although we may love our food we all have our likes and dislikes

'Despite seeming to be a nation of foodies, the research shows that everyone has their individual tastes.'

1) Anchovies (44 per cent)

2) Chicken Liver (41 per cent)

3) Olives (39 per cent)

4) Black pudding (39 per cent)

5) Blue Cheese (38 per cent)

6) Goats Cheese (27 per cent)

7) Avocado (24 per cent)

8) Brussel Sprouts (24 per cent)
