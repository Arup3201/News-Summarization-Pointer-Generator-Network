Filming has begun for one of the hotly-anticipated films of the decade on a remote windswept island off the coast of south-west Ireland.

Skellig Michael on the Kerry coastline is being used to film scenes for Star Wars Episode 7 - and the island is on lockdown as the cast and crew descend on the magnificent locale.

The Unesco World Heritage site Skellig Michael has been closed to the public for the next three days. An Irish Navy ship is also monitoring the site.

Hundreds of sci-fi fans have flocked to the sleepy village of Portmagee to catch a glimpse of the Star Wars cast. The cast, director JJ Abrams, film crew, support crew, make-up, and costume have all arrived and have spent the first day on Skellig Michael.

Skellig Michael was the chosen destination for a small group of ascetic monks who, in their pursuit of greater union with God, withdrew from civilisation to this remote and inaccessible place. They lived in these spartan 'beehive' huts

It is understood that at least 12 private boat operators have had their services booked up for the days of the shoot as they ferry cast, crew, and equipment over to Skellig in the morning and back again in the evening.

The Irish Daily Mail reported that all B&Bs and hotels in the area have already been booked out for the week. Kerry tour boat operators, which usually bring tourists to the majestic island on a daily basis, will not be sailing today, tomorrow or on Wednesday.

John O’Sullivan, of tourist company Skellig Experience, said on Thursday: ‘If the weather is fine, the camera work out there could be stunning. The scenery is spectacular up there. It’s a majestic and mysterious place.’

JJ Abrams, who directed Mission Impossible and TV show Lost, is at the helm for the new film Star Wars: Episode VII, which is currently shooting in Pinewood Studios in the UK.

The Irish Office of Public Works had already confirmed the Kerry site has been made available for a film shoot on the island and the work is fully supported by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

A spokesman for the OPW said: ‘The OPW will be providing on-site support through our staff who are present on the Island throughout the summer, as normal.

‘They will be continuing to manage visitors throughout and will, obviously, continue to safeguard the national monument and the island, which is a world heritage site.’

‘This production is being fully supported by the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Irish Film Board.’

Not a hive of scum and villainy: John O’Sullivan, of tourist company Skellig Experience, said on Thursday: ‘If the weather is fine, the camera work out there could be stunning. The scenery is spectacular up there. It’s a majestic and mysterious place.’

JJ Abrams, who directed Mission Impossible and TV show Lost, is at the helm for the new film Star Wars: Episode VII, which is currently shooting in Pinewood Studios in the UK.

Irish actor Domhnall Gleeson, who landed a role in the blockbuster, already said he is excited about the movie, which is due to be released in December next year.

He said: ‘I don’t want to say too much about it because I am terrified I will accidentally give the entire story away. But obviously I’m extremely excited about it.

‘We had the read-through and it was incredible sitting in the room with all those unbelievably talented actors.’

Gleeson has been cast in the franchise alongside the original stars of the series Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill. Scenes from the film have already been shot in Abu Dhabi and in London.

The Skellig Rocks, Skellig Michael (also known as Great Skellig) and Little Skellig, are towering sea crags rising from the Atlantic Ocean almost eight miles west of the Ivereagh Peninsula in County Kerry.

Located at the western edge of the European landmass, Skellig Michael was the chosen destination for a small group of ascetic monks who, in their pursuit of greater union with God, withdrew from civilisation to this remote and Inaccessible place.

Some time between the sixth and eight centuries, a monastery was founded on this precipitous rock giving rise to one of the most dramatic examples of the extremes of Christian monasticism.

The monastic community appears to have moved to the mainland by the thirteenth century but the island continued to be venerated as a place of pilgrimage in the following centuries. In the nineteenth century, two lighthouses were built on Skellig Michael, establishing its importance in Ireland’s maritime history.

Skellig Michael is also one of Ireland’s most important sites for breeding seabirds both in terms of size of colonies and diversity of species.
