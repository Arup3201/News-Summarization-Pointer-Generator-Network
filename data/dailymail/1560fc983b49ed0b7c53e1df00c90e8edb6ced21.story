After photographs of her shapely figure at the Royal Wedding gained worldwide attention, few can blame Pippa Middleton for making the most of her enviable looks.

And the cover of her eagerly awaited book about party planning is unlikely to leave her legion of male fans feeling disappointed - her picture appears no fewer than four times.

Miss Middleton is shown in a range of saccharine poses on the front and back of her debut book, entitled Celebrate: A Year of Festivities for Families and Friends.

Not camera shy: Pippa Middleton is pictured no fewer than four times on the front (left) and back (right) cover of her eagerly awaited book, Celebrate: A Year of Festivities for Families and Friends

In one picture, she is seen playing frisbee on the beach. Others include a scene of her helping a little girl to cook.

Billed as a 'comprehensive seasonal guide to simple and creative entertaining', it is a book which Miss Middleton hopes will cement her credentials as a party planner, and industry observers believe it could net her a small fortune in the process.

The cover's patchwork quilt-style design may come as a surprise to some readers, however, as Miss Middleton has strongly defended her right to privacy in recent years.

Newspapers have given an undertaking that they will not use paparazzi photographs of her because of her request to remain largely out of the public gaze.

Famous face: Pippa Middleton has gained worldwide notoriety since the Royal Wedding last year, but she has asked that her privacy is respected

Whether Miss Middleton will be able 
to maintain her position that she is a private citizen following the 
book's release remains to be seen.

Her
first tome is expected to generate much publicity, and it was reported 
last month that she has negotiated a six-figure book deal with 
publishers Michael Joseph, the branch of the Penguin Group that deals 
with ‘highly commercial’ properties.

Miss
Middleton is also frequently seen at public events. Only nine days ago,
she attended a launch for adventurer and presenter Ben Fogle's new 
book, The Accidental Naturalist.

Miss Middleton has insisted on 
writing the book, described as a cross between a party planning bible, 
entertainment guide and recipe book, herself.

Phenomenon: Photographs of Miss Middleton's enviable figure were viewed across the globe after her sister Kate's wedding to Prince William

Rubbing shoulders: Pippa Middleton with Prince Harry on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after the Royal Wedding. Miss Middleton's book deal has led to accusations that she has cashed in on her Royal connections

It is already available for ordering on retail website Amazon ahead of its October 25 release date.The book was originally priced at £25, but can now be bought for £16.77.

However, Miss Middleton's book deal has attracted criticism, with some observers accusing her of cashing in on her sister Kate's position as a senior Royal.

Similar accusations have been levelled at the Middletons' family business, Party Pieces, which shortly before the Royal Wedding produced a range of paper plates, platters, bowls and napkins emblazoned with crowns, crests and coats of arms.

Kate and Pippa's parents, Carole and Mike Middleton, were eager to avoid being seen as cashing in on the wedding, but their business was inevitably boosted by the publicity surrounding the occasion.

The number of visitors to the company's website quadrupled after the wedding.

Advantageous: Carole and Mike Middleton have been eager to avoid being seen as cashing in on their Royal connections. Pippa's book deal has led to similar criticism
