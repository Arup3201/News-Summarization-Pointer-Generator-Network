A man lies on a stretcher at a hospital in Herat, west Afghanistan recovering from having his leg and hand cut off by Taliban militants.

The attack yesterday saw two men captured and dragged in front of a Taliban court who ruled the men should have a leg and a hand each chopped off for working with the allied forces.

The men work for a company that provides logistics for NATO convoys in western Herat province, police said.

'These two men are from Koshk Robat Sangi district. They were caught by the Taliban. Each of them have lost one hand and one leg,' said Noor Khan Nekzad, spokesman for the Herat police.

The attack on the two men was today followed by two more assaults by Taliban insurgents, making April the deadliest month in Afghanistan this year with 222 people killed in violent actions.

Militants shot dead six police officers at a checkpoint in the Dayak district of Ghazni province, wounding one and leaving one missing, said deputy police chief Colonel Mohammad Hussain.

The second attack hit Paktika province where a suicide bomber killed three and wounded seven, including two police officers, in a shopping bazaar.

Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack.

Reflecting the surge in violence, the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office reported today that insurgent-initiated attacks increased by 47 per cent during the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period last year.

Afghanistan's Defence Ministry said the Afghan army carried out 2,209 military operations during a month-long period ending today.

During that time, 467 insurgents and 107 soldiers were killed, and 362 militants were arrested.

The Taliban broke off formal talks with NATO last year and have steadfastly rejected negotiations with the Afghan government, which they view as acting under instructions from allied nations.

Afghanistan has about 100,000 international troops, including 66,000 from the United States.
