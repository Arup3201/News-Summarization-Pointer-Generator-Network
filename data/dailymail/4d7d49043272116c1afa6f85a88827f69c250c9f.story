The newly-released biopic of Apple founder Steve Jobs, entitled Jobs, has resulted in a furious exchange between Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and the film's lead, Ashton Kutcher.

Kutcher plays the tech visionary in the film, about which Wozniak has posted his own unsolicited review on the tech site Gizmodo.

Wozniak dismissed the film, which follows Jobs from his days as a college drop-out to the game-changing release of the iPod in 2001, as 'fiction' and accused Kutcher of being 'disingenuous'.

The film only opened in the U.S. over the weekend, but has already garnered lukewarm reviews for its handling of the subject.

'I suspect a lot of what was wrong with the film came from Ashton's own image of Jobs,' wrote Wozniak.

Kutcher spent three months preparing for his role as Jobs, including reading, watching and listening to all material about the tech visionary and even following the same extreme diet as Jobs.

Early days: This shot of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in the garage of Jobs' parents' house was taken in 1976

The actor, who has said he cried the day Jobs died and that he 'loved a man he never knew,' has accused Wozniak of being in the pay of another film studio which is putting out its own Jobs movie, and said that he was 'extremely unavailable us when producing this film'.

Wozniak responded that Kutcher's film had already been written - making his consultation unnecessary - and that he was 'turned off' by the Jobs script.

Wozniak is reported to have met with Aaron Sorkin, who is adapting Walter Isaacson’s official biography of Jobs.

He said Kutcher, who was also a producer on the film, must 'still be in character' to accuse him of disparaging the film for money from another movie studio.

'Either film would have paid me to consult,' he wrote, 'but the Jobs one already had a script written. I can't take that creative leadership from someone else. And I was turned off by the Jobs script. But I still hoped for a great movie.'

Wozniak, offended by the inference that he would slander the film for money, mentioned an important part of Apple history that wasn't included in the film.

'When Apple decided not to reward early friends who helped, I gave them large blocks of my own stock. Because it was right. And I made it possible for 80 other employees to get some stock prior to the IPO so they could participate in the wealth,' he wrote.

Wozniak challenged the film's accuracy - 
which has also been derided by other critics - and said, 'I felt bad for
many people I know well who were portrayed wrongly in their 
interactions with Jobs and the company.'

Wozniak
also thinks the film was too easy on Jobs, who is glorified as a tech genius and businessman extraordinaire from the very beginning, when he didn't necessarily possess those skills, while other players in the Apple story weren't given credit in the film.

Influenced: Wozniak says Kutcher's portrayal of Jobs was colored by the actor's own admiration for the tech entrepreneur

'The movie ends pretty much where the great Jobs finally found product success and changed so many of our lives,' Wozniak wrote.

'I’m grateful to Steve for his excellence in the i-era, and his contribution to my own life of enjoying great products, but this movie portrays him having had those skills in earlier times.'

Wozniak didn't comment on how he himself was portrayed in the film (by actor Josh Gad), but did have praise for the performances.

'I thought the acting throughout was good. I was attentive and entertained but not greatly enough to recommend the movie,' Wozniak wrote.

'One friend who is in the movie said he didn't want to watch fiction, so he wasn't interested in seeing it.'

Wozniak was the designer of the Apple II computer and left Apple in 1987.
