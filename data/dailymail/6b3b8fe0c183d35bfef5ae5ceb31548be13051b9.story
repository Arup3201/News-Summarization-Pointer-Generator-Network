As far as undercover police operations go, this one mounted by law enforcement in China turned out to be the mother of all mix-ups.

Officers had planned to bring four suspected armed robbers back to the scene so they could question them about the details of their alleged crime.

But news of the planned visit leaked out to local media, causing a public circus that officers fought hard to contain.

Operation farce: Officers had planned to bring four armed robbers back to the scene so they could question them about the details of their alleged crime, but were thwarted by the deluge of onlookers

Thousands of people, bored with TV and playing internet games, turned out to watch what they thought might be a re-enactment of the crime.

They flooded into the street, stood on cars, lined walls and hung out of windows.

'It was madness,' said police spokesman Sun Yul. 'In the end it was all we could do to restore order.'

Police hoped that taking the suspects back to the scene would allow them to work out which of the four men allegedly stabbed the owner of a gold store during a brutal robbery.

The high-profile raid had made the local news bulletins for days.

Expectant crowd: Most of those who turned out to try to see them came equipped with cameras to get snaps of the action in the city of Guiyang in southwest China's Guizhou province

When news that the alleged robbers were about to return to the scene was revealed, it gripped the public imagination.

Sun Yul added: 'We had to take the robbers back to the police station forthwith for their own safety. It was chaos out there. It was like they had achieved superstar status when they are really low rent crooks.'

On the night of May 11, four robbers with knives went into the gold store, smashed the counters, took away gold worth 300,000 RMB (Â£28,000) and stabbed the female boss of the store before fleeing.

Just 24 hours later, police arrested all of the suspects and got back the gold.

They were supposed to go back to the store to walk detectives through what happened when the mob forced the cancellation of their return.

'This will take place, only it will not be in the newspapers beforehand next time,' added Sun Yul.
