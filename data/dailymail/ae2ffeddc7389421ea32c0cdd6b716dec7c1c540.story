A singer has admitted carrying out a glass attack that resulted in her band being kicked off the X Factor.

Girl-group Quantro reached the boot camp stages of the competition before bosses threw them out after band member Lucie Slater was accused of attacking her ex-boyfriend William Scott Aitken.

Horrifying photos taken in hospital of his injuries showed several cuts across his nose and cheek and the right-hand side was swollen due to a large gash.

Attacked: Scott Aitkin, who performs as a DJ under the name 'Scottie Hollywood' was the victim of a glass attack by Lucie Slater, in June this year

Sentenced: Slater, 21, left, of Ryton, Gateshead, was charged with wounding with intent, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, after the  incident at Mr Aitken's right, home in Northumberland

Slater, 21, of Ryton, Gateshead, was charged with wounding with intent, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, after the incident at Mr Aitken's home in Northumberland.

Before her trial was due to start at Newcastle Crown Court  today she pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of unlawful wounding, which has a maximum sentence of five years behind bars.

Her barrister Peter Schofield said Slater accepts 'at the point this took place she had a glass in her hand.'

Axed: At the time of the attack former fellow member Hannah Gray said her and the rest of Quantro were left devastated by the decision of the X Factor bosses to remove the whole group from the show

Mr Schofield asked for the curfew condition of Slater's bail to be lifted to allow her to do night time promotional work.

Mr Recorder Toby Hedworth QC agreed to lift the condition and extended her bail with residence requirements and orders to stay away from Mr Aitken and his place of work.

The judge warned 'all of the court sentencing options' will be open to him when Slater is back in court next month.

And he added: 'Were there to be any further difficulty in the period before Sentence is imposed it would have a significant bearing on the eventual outcome of the case.'

The judge ordered a pre-sentence report from the probation service to provide him with more information on Slater and her background before sentence is imposed.

Mr Aitken, a DJ at the Tiger Tiger bar in Newcastle, needed medical treatment after the attack in June.

At the time of the attack former fellow member Hannah Gray said her and the rest of the band were left devastated by the decision of the X Factor bosses to remove the whole group from the show.

The 20-year-old from Ponteland, Northumberland, said: 'We got fantastic comments from the judges and we are just heartbroken.

'We have worked so hard to get to where we are. We can't thank people enough for the support we've been given and that's why the band is going to carry on.'

After being disqualified from the show, the band tweeted: 'We'd like to thank everybody so so much from the bottom of our hearts for the support everyone gave us.

'It meant everything and will strive us to continue what we love. Keep your dreams alive xx.'

The group, made up of Carly Ahmad, Emily Dyson, Hannah Gray and Lucie, impressed crowds outside the X Factor auditions with their rendition of Lloyd's Dedication To My Ex.

An X Factor spokesman said the group could not continue as a three-piece as it was too far into the competition, but that they could re-audition for the show next year.
