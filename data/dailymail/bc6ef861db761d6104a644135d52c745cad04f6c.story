Denial: Boris Johnson says he is definitely not going to return to Parliament

Boris Johnson is being lined up to return to a safe Commons seat in 2015 and mount an immediate leadership challenge if David Cameron fails to secure an overall majority.

Allies of the London Mayor, whose popularity has been boosted by the success of the Olympics and Paralympics, played down the prospect of him making a Westminster comeback before that.

Their comments came despite swirling rumours of plots against the Prime Minister and to install Mr Johnson.

One Conservative MP, Colonel Bob Stewart, said two colleagues approached him before the summer break to consider a ‘stalking horse’ challenge for the party leadership that might open the door for Mr Johnson to take over. But Colonel Stewart told them to ‘get lost’.

The Mayor infuriated Number Ten by going to war with Mr Cameron last week, criticising what he called a ‘fudgearama’ over increasing airport capacity.

But a spokesman for Mr Johnson dismissed as ‘fanciful’ a claim that multi- millionaire Tory rebel Zac Goldsmith, who has threatened to quit Parliament if the Government goes ahead with a third runway at Heathrow, offered his south-west London seat to the Mayor.

However, despite the denials from City Hall, the rumours about Mr Johnson's return to Westminster do not seem to be going away.

The two men were said to have discussed 
the prospect of a by-election in Mr Goldsmith’s Richmond constituency 
following last week’s Cabinet reshuffle, in which Mr Cameron sidelined 
ministers who are opposed to Heathrow expansion.

Mr Johnson did meet Mr Goldsmith and the 
by-election scheme is thought to have been ‘jokingly’ mentioned, but the
 Mayor is said to have dismissed it out of hand.

Mr Goldsmith wrote yesterday on 
Twitter: ‘I have never offered to resign! But I did promise before the 
election that I would, if the Government U-turns on Heathrow.’

But MPs who want to see Mr Johnson in 
Downing Street confirmed privately that advanced discussions had taken 
place on finding him a seat for the 2015 election.

Mr Goldsmith’s seat is not considered 
safe enough because it is a marginal. Two that have been discussed by Mr
 Johnson’s supporters are Mole Valley, where veteran MP Sir Paul 
Beresford might be persuaded to step down, and Henley, the Mayor’s old 
Commons seat.

Mr Johnson has always insisted he has 
no intention of trying to oust Mr Cameron and has pledged to see out his
 second term as Mayor.

But while he would be heavily 
criticised if he tried to combine the role of mayor and MP for an 
extended period, he is due to leave office in London in 2016.

That would mean the two jobs would 
only overlap for a year if he made a comeback at the next general 
election. One rebel MP said: ‘The aim is that Boris is in place at the 
next election. If Cameron loses the election badly, he’ll resign and 
Boris will stand, but if he misses a majority again and tries to stitch 
up another coalition with the Lib Dems then there will be blood on the 
walls. We won’t let him do it again.’

Another rebel Tory, Nadine Dorries, said: ‘We need to get Boris in and Cameron out to survive 2015.’

But Mr Johnson said he was ‘absolutely
 not’ planning a return to the Commons. ‘As I said in the election about
 a billion times, being Mayor is the best job in British politics and 
it’s what I want to do,’ he said.
