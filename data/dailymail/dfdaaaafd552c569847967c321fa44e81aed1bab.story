Australian of the Year Adam Goodes has attracted criticism for saying Australian history is built on lies.

During a recent interview with the BBC, the AFL star said some Australian policies had resulted in the suppression of indigenous people and other minorities and called for better education about the country's history.

'The history of our country is built on so much lies and racial policies, and things that have suppressed my people and lots of minorities in this country, so you can't blame people for having the views that they have,' he said.

He also said children needed to be taught that Australia wasn't founded by Captain James Cook.

'I can use my position to help educate people to see through the things that they've been taught growing up,' he said.

'Open their minds (and realise) 'That's not true: Captain Cook didn't found Australia' as I was taught in high school.'

Talkback radio host Neil Mitchell criticised Goodes for trying to 'change the country'.

'The sooner Adam Goodes finishes as Australian of the Year the better, as far as I'm concerned,' he said.

'At times Adam Goodes seems not to like Australia.'

One Twitter user called Goodes 'by far the worst (Australian of the year) we've ever had' while another called him 'wanker of the year'.

But there was also support for the Sydney Swans star, with Twitter users saying 'Neil Mitchells pathetic response to Adam Goodes just proves Adam is correct in what he is saying,' and 'I support @adamroy37 as Australian of The Year. Disappointing that @3AWNeilMitchell made such inflammatory & inaccurate comments this morning'.

Goodes stepped up his work as an anti-racism campaigner last year after being subjected to abuse by a 13-year-old girl during a Sydney Swans game, and later became the subject of a joke made by Collingwood President Eddie McGuire in relation to King Kong the musical.

Goodes has been the target of a string of racial attacks in the past two years.

Last year Goodes was called an 'ape' by a teenage girl in the crowd during a Swans match against Collingwood - and incredibly it occured during the AFL's indigenous round.

Eddie McGuire's friendship with Goodes was over when he likened the footy star to 'King Kong'

Goodes then ended his friendship with Collingwood president Eddie McGuire after the radio host likened him 'King Kong' on his popular radio show on Triple M.

'I would have liked to have called Eddie a friend before that incident.

'Friends don’t make jokes about their friends like that.'

In May he was targeted by racist Facebook users purporting to be AFL fans in a grubby poll ranking the league's least favourite player.

'Goodes is a hairy monkey and deserves his place on this list,' one user wrote, while others referred to him as a 'dog' and an 'ape'.

In October he was mentioned by a controversial poetry professor in a string of inflammatory emails, writing: 'Abo Lover Abbott and [Sydney Swans footballer] Adam Goodes' were 'Siamese twins' who could only be separated by undergoing surgery.
