They beat hundreds of women to be crowned the sexiest women in the world last night.

And while Mila Kunis and Helen Flanagan's accolade might be down to good genetics and a healthy diet, new research suggests that the secret to looking great is actually all in the stars.

Like Helen and Mila, you’re nearly twice as likely to visit the gym if you’re a Leo than any other zodiac sign.

Written in the stars: According to the latest research, those with a Leo star sign like Helen Flanagan and Mila Kunis are much more likely to go to the gym

Leo’s are described as extremely positive, enthusiastic and supremely confident – all the ingredients needed to be a keen gym goer. Negative traits associated with the star sign include being conceited and self-centred.

Female celebrities from the Leo family also include the likes of Madonna, Millie Mackintosh, Donna Air, Nicole Scherzinger, Jennifer Lawrence, Hayden Panettiere, Charlize Theron and Jennifer Lopez - all proud owners of great physiques.

But all is not lost if you’re not born at that time of the year - Geminis and Taureans came second.

Taurus boast an equally impressive line-up of toned female celebrities with Carmen Electra, Megan Fox, Miranda Kerr and Jessica Alba all being members of this zodiac sign.

Not to be outdone, Gemini has renowned beach babes Michelle Keegan, Angeline Jolie and Kylie Minogue falling within this particular star sign.

Sagittarius however is by far the least fit star sign and the least likely to produce sporty celebrity stars.

One of the better-known celebrities from this sign is Britney Spears who no longer prioritises fitness into her daily routine.

A spokesman for fitness company payasUgym.com, who carried out the survey, said: 'It’s interesting to see that the likelihood of a person attending a gym appears to be predestined by the stars, particularly when you see the depth of celebrities that are born under Taurus.'

Lazy bones: As a Sagittarius Britney Spears is expected to be more lax when it comes to exercise, but Cameron Diaz bucks the trend for couch-potato Virgos as she is a fitnedd fiend
