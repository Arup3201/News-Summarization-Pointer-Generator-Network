Held: Faruq Khalil Muhammad 'Isa, 36, pleaded not guilty after being extradited to the United States on Friday to stand trial charges of providing material support to terrorists

A Canadian citizen pleaded not guilty Saturday to charges he wired money and provided support to Tunisian extremists who committed a 2009 suicide attack in Iraq that killed five American soldiers.

Faruq Khalil Muhammad 'Isa, 36, entered the plea in federal court in Brooklyn after being extradited to the United States on Friday to stand trial on terror charges.

The Iraqi national was charged in connection with a 2009 suicide bombing in Mosul that killed soldiers outside US Army Forward Operating Base Marez, Muhammad 'Isa's indictment stated.

Muhammad 'Isa confessed to speaking with two of the men believed to be involved in the attack over email while they were in Syria, according to his extradition request.

The request also alleges that he talked with others who acted as 'facilitators' working to get the jihadists access into Iraq, sending one $700.

The New York Daily News reports that another jihadist arrested shortly after the bombing admitted in an interview that Muhammad 'Isa 'regularly communicated' with him about killing Americans in Iraq. 

'Did you hear about the huge incident yesterday? ... He was one of the Tunisian brothers,' the indictment states Muhammad 'Isa wrote to a collaborator a day after the attack, according to court documents.

A wiretap caught Muhammad 'Isa referring to the terrorists in code as 'farmers (who) plant metal and harvest metal and flesh,' according to the indictment.

Authorities arrested Muhammad 'Isa in Canada on a US warrant in 2011 after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, assisted by US, Canadian and Tunisian authorities.

After being extradited to the US, he was indicted on seven counts of providing material support and murder by a Brooklyn grand jury. The charges carry a life sentence if he's convicted. 

US Attorney Loretta Lynch said the arrest 'demonstrates to those who orchestrate violence against our citizens and our soldiers that there is no corner of the globe from which they can hide from the long reach of the law.'
