Expecting: Peter Andre and his girlfriend Emily MacDonagh are to have a baby

She hasn’t got a Twitter profile and she keeps her Facebook page private.

Given that she has spent the last three years as a medical student, 23-year-old Emily MacDonagh probably has little time for such inconsequential social networking – or simply values her own space.

All that, however, looks destined to change after she fell into the plastic celebrity world of Peter Andre – a man 17 years her senior – and became pregnant with his child.

While Andre’s fans have been quick to congratulate the pair, the Daily Mail understands Miss MacDonagh’s family have been ‘left cold’ by the thought that Andre – who has two children with former wife Jordan – will now be a permanent fixture in the life of their only daughter.

A friend of the 40-year-old singer said although Miss MacDonagh’s family like him they think he has ‘a lot of baggage’ and their daughter faces having her life turned into a tacky circus with every aspect laid bare for public consumption.

A true king of downmarket reality TV, Andre provides constant updates about his life to almost 3million followers on Twitter, and earlier this month launched The Peter Andre Channel online telling fans they can now watch him 24 hours a day.

Miss MacDonagh, meanwhile, has mainly enjoyed an idyllic and quiet upbringing as a ‘solid, middle-class girl’ in a family home in Somerset.

Ironically Andre and Miss MacDonagh would never have met were it not for her surgeon father Ruaraidh MacDonagh, 55.

He was the star’s consultant during surgery for kidney stones in 2010 and, knowing she was a fan of his music, introduced her to him.

The pair developed a friendship but did not begin dating until summer 2012.

Miss MacDonagh has now deferred the final year of her medical course in order to concentrate on impending motherhood.

The source said: ‘Her family thought it would just be a nice romance and that she would finish university and that as she matured it would run its course.

They like Pete but this was not the path they had planned for their daughter – deferring university to have a baby with a man almost twice her age.

‘Pete sees Emily as a sweet girl and chose her because she has no interest in being famous and won’t emasculate him like his former wife.

'Emily wasn’t interested in his celebrity at all. But that could be the undoing of their relationship because in order to be with Peter you need to love the vapid and superficial celebrity world that he occupies.’

Andre has seldom been out of the limelight since being offered a role on talent show Hey Hey It’s Saturday as a teenager.

A string of hit singles followed and in 2004 his status as a reality TV star was sealed when he entered hit ITV show I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here!

It was in the Australian jungle that he met Jordan, real name Katie Price.

The pair embarked on a much-publicised relationship, marrying and having two children: Princess Tiaamii, six, and Junior, eight.

Their relationship played out for their fans on their reality TV programme and when they separated in 2009 Andre was given his own show.

The eldest of five siblings, Miss MacDonagh and her brothers grew up in a property worth more than £1million in Bridgwater.

Friends now fear the student could be heading for a collision with Andre’s formidable manager Claire Powell, who helps secure his TV and magazine deals.

The friend said: ‘Emily’s parents are not big fans of the world Pete lives in.’

Another source however said Andre’s family was not so different from Miss MacDonagh’s. The source said: ‘Peter’s dad is an architect and his parents have been married for around 60 years with five children.

‘Despite the pop star career, Peter has a lot in common with Emily and that is why they get on so well.

‘He has built up a great business outside of showbiz, and owns three properties around the world.’

A spokesman for Andre denied Miss MacDonagh’s family were disappointed that she was with the star and said he and Miss MacDonagh’s father had just spent two weeks on holiday together and they are good friends.
