Christine Bleakley is replacing Holly Willoughby as co-host of ITV's celebrity skating show Dancing on Ice.

The star, who quit the BBC last year with her former One Show host Adrian Chiles, said she was a 'total Dancing on Ice addict.'

She will join co-host Phillip Schofield on the show when it returns next year for a seventh series.

Bleakley said: 'My only concern was what a big task it is to follow the brilliant Holly and I can only promise her, Phillip and everyone at home that they couldn't have a bigger fan of the show on board.'

Schofield said he was 'absolutely delighted' that Bleakley was joining the show which was won last year by ex-EastEnders actor Sam Attwater.

Bleakley and Chiles have struggled to recreate their One Show success on ITV's breakfast show Daybreak.

It was criticised for battling to match the GMTV audience in its early stages and has consistently pulled in fewer viewers than its BBC1 rival Breakfast.

ITV Director of Television, Peter Fincham said: 'Dancing on Ice continues to be one of ITV1’s most successful entertainment hits and I’m delighted that Christine will be joining Phillip Schofield to host next year’s show.'

Willougby tweeted this evening: 'Good luck to Christine Bleakley on this years Dancing on Ice. It's a truely (sic) magical show and you will love it. I'll miss you all very much!'

Farewell: Holly wished her successor all the best

The bubbly presenter will continue working with Schofield on This Morning and her duties on ITV2's Celebrity Juice, but has 'other commitments' over the winter season, a statement released by the network said.

Holly declined to be drawn on what is preventing her from working on Dancing on Ice when pressed by fans on Twitter, simply saying all will be revealed next week.

She added: 'No, I'm not pregnant!'

There is some speculation that Willoughby, who is not on an exclusive ITV contract, has been wooed to the BBC to present new talent show The Voice.
