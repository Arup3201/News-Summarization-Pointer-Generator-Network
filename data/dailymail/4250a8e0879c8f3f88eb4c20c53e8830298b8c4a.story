After spending $184,000 on a new motor, most people would - at the very least - expect the car to have working doors.

But if the model in question is the rarest Mini ever made - one of just of 15 and a personal favourite of the Queen - perhaps you could make an exception.

The 1962 Austin Mini Beach Car, built without doors or side-pillars, fetched more than double its estimated value of $70,000 at Bonhams' Quail Lodge sale in California this week. 

Only 15 models of the Austin Mini Beach Car were made by British Motor Corporation in 1962

The car, built without doors or side-pillars, was bought for $184,000 at Bonhams' Quail Lodge sale in California this week

The car, which has a tiny 849cc engine producing a modest 34bhp, was built 52 years ago by British Motor Corporation - with all but one being made as left-hand drives with the intention of being shipped over to the USA.

The one right-hand drive that was produced was loaned to the Royal Family and it is thought that the Queen enjoyed driving the golf-buggy-like motor around Windsor Castle.

At the time, the Daily Express wrote: 'The Queen, a knowledgeable motorist, doubtless enjoys travelling in this unconventional little vehicle as much as she does in her Rolls.' 

Despite being 52-years-old, the car has had just three owners since it was first shipped to San Francisco and has covered only 12,000 miles - an average of 4.4 miles per week.

At $184,000, it is a world record price paid for a Mini at auction and 200 times what the original model cost back in 1962.

The car also cost the frivolous buyer $157,000 more than the cheapest Mini currently made by BMW is worth. 

David Swig, motorcar specialist at Bonhams, said: 'This powder blue, beach-going Mini - also known as the Riviera Buggy - is the rarest Mini variant. 

'Built by hand, the car is a quirky, fun, early example from the iconic British Mini brand, perfect for beach lovers.'
