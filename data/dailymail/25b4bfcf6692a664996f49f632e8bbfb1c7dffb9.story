Defendant: Shaun Whitt (above) has been charged with sexual battery on a victim younger than 12-years-old

A teenager spent an emotional two hours on the stand yesterday as she testified against her accused rapist in a Florida courtroom.

Shaun White, 32, of Palm Coast, Florida, is accused of sexually assaulting the young girl in her home while her mother was at work, starting when she was just 11-years-old.

Whitt was also dating the girl's mother at the time. 

The now 14-year-old, who cried through most of her testimony, told the six member jury, 'I didn't want to believe it happened to me.'

Most of the abuse happened on her bedroom floor she revealed, starting in December of 2010

At the time, she had just turned 11-years-old.

Her mother was always at work when the abuse occurred. 

According to The Daytona Beach News-Journal, the young girl testified in the Bunnell, Florida courtroom that Whitt would tell her to take off her clothes and lie down, then he would strip off his clothes and rape her while she remained completely silent.

'There was no one to scream for,' she said.

'I didn't want him to see me cry.' 

The abuse happened 'frequently and often' according to Assistant State Attorney Christina Opsahl. 

The young girl built up the courage to write a note about the abuse in early 2012 and gave it to one of her teachers at school.

Whitt was picked up by officials at his home shortly thereafter on charges of sexual battery on a victim younger than 12-years-old.

A medical exam performed after the girl made her report showed that the she had been sexually battered, and carpet samples taken from her room included Whitt's DNA.

He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted. 

Closing arguments are expected to be heard today.
