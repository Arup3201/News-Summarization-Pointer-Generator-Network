We've had up-scaled burgers, hot dogs and fish and chips but up to now, the poor beleaguered kebab has been left well alone.

Well, not anymore.

The much-maligned Turkish staple is now getting a makeover thanks to Nick Green and Matthew Kershaw, who have opened 'premium kebab destination' Chifafa that has 24-hour marinated veal shoulder kebab on the menu costing £8.40.

Luxed-up kebab: Slow cooked lamb shoulder with feta, mango pickle and fresh dill tahini yoghurt

The 'premium kebab destination' Chifafa is on Clerkenwell Road, London 

'Everyone knows that you can go down to Green Lanes or Edgware Road and have a great sit down kebab at a Turkish or Lebanese restaurant,' said co-founder Nick Green.

'But unfortunately there are also lots of kebab restaurants around the UK that treat the food with less reverence, and accordingly the kebab's reputation isn't great over here.

'People associate them with the drunken walk home from the pub, and we want to dispel that stereotype once and for all and create something really tasty and healthy that people can eat quickly at lunchtime as well as in the evening.'

A world away from the usual kebab shops: Chifafa's pared down menu has five options

'I have a hunch that the average doner kebab is going to get a makeover. Think house made wraps and decent meat cooked on wood grills and in smokers and you get the idea,' James Ferguson, head chef of the Hoxton's The Beagle said to FEMAIL.

And he may be right. Kebabs, which have long been associated with a quick way to soak up the alcohol after a drunken binge are the latest food to be luxed up in London. 

They appear on the menu at Dishoom (minced lamb marinated with lime, coriander and cumin). Alan Yau, founder of Busuba Eathai, Hakkasan, Wagamama and Yauatcha has opened Turkish restaurant Babaji on Shaftesbury Avenue serving kebabs, and there are rumours that Yotam Ottolenghi’s business partner Noam Baris is planning to launch a fast-food business that revolves around kebabs.

The restaurant seats 25 people but almost 70 per cent of its custom comes from takeaway orders, Mr Green said. 

'It's a fast casual restaurant, the type of place like Leon or Itsu or Chipotle,' he explained to FEMAIL. 

'We have seating for 25 people but 70 per cent of people take away. 

'The key is to change the perception of the kebab away from something fit only for the stagger home from the pub into something fresh, healthy and an acceptable lunch meal. 

'When most women hear the word kebab they shudder as they think of the greasy doner on a spot. We like to think our kebabs will be as popular with women as they will with men,' he said. 

A world away from their downmarket cousins, the pared down menu at the Clekernwell road eaterie has five kebabs on offer. 

They include slow cooked lamb shoulder with feta, mango pickle and fresh dill tahini yoghurt, British veal in lemon, oregano and garlic, tomatoes and fresh mine and dill tzatziki and za'atar dusted halloumi, pickled turnip, hummus and fresh mint tahini yoghurt.

Prices start at £5.90 for a chicken kebab and go up to £8.40 for veal and there are plans to add a lamb meatball special to the menu in the next two weeks. 

Diners can personalise their kebab by adding various condiments such as smoked garlic yoghurt, chilli sauces, and freshly prepared salads.

Mr Green and Mr Kershaw are also working with Action Against Hunger organiser Ben Maschler and Gillian Thomson, ex head of operations at Gordon Ramsey.

'We're hoping to cater for working people who are time-poor who want really good quality food served quickly,' says Matthew Kershaw. 'And hopefully in the process we can make the kebab synonymous with eating well.'
