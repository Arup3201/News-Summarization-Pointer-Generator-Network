A lottery millionaire who was jailed for battering his girlfriend has been sentenced to another four months in jail after he was caught with drugs.

Jailed: Lottery winner Gavin Davies has received a four month jail sentence after being caught with cannabis

Former professional cagefighter Gavin Davies, of Ammanford, near Swansea, spent his winnings on cannabis two months after picking up a £1million jackpot.

When the 30-year-old was unveiled as the lottery winner in January this year Davies said he 'won't waste a penny'.

He said:  'I want to look after my son and look after my family.

'I'm going to use the money wisely and invest.

But in July, the 30-year-old was jailed for 16 months after beating his girlfriend, Daniah Hussain, 22, inside his Audi. 

He had tried to strangle her with a seatbelt, knocked her to the floor and put his teeth around her nose.

When he appeared at Swansea Crown Court he blamed the sustained assault on the strain of becoming an overnight millionaire.

And today he received a second sentence of four months in prison at Llanelli Magistrates Court after admitting possessing the class B drug.

Davies, who enjoyed spending his money on expensive cars including a Lamborghini, was arrested in possession of the drug just weeks after hitting the jackpot in December.

He was revealed as the £1 million National Lottery raffle winner at a press conference in a plush Swansea hotel in January.

He was pictured alongside a Lamborghini, provided for the day by lottery operator Camelot.

But he was soon seen purring around his hometown in his own Lamborghini and his new Audi.

At the time of the win, Davies said: 'Time will tell, but hopefully, you will see me one day with £10 million.

'The Lamborghini is my fun out of the way. The rest of the money is to look after my family.'

Battering: Davies was jailed in July for 16 months for beating up his girlfriend in one his luxury cars

During the earlier hearing, Swansea Crown Court heard how he tried to strangle his 22-year-old girlfriend with a car seatbelt because of a row over a shopping trip.

The court was told Davies blamed the 'sustained assault' on the stress of winning the lottery, moving into a new house and becoming a father.

Motoring fan Davies bought three luxury cars after his win - including a Lamborghini LP560-4.

The court heard how Davies and Miss Hussain were travelling in his 'everyday' car - an Audi - to go on a luxury shopping trip to spend some of their winnings.

Family: Davies said he would spend his winnings wisely and use it look after his family

But the pair started arguing when 
Davies tried to back out of the family shopping day because he had 
meetings with financial advisors to discuss how to invest his fortune.

The court heard Davies pulled over 
and tried to strangle Miss Hussain with the Audi’s seatbelt, telling 
her: 'If you don’t shut up, I will shut you up.'

Davies was jailed for 16 months in 
July after admitting causing actual bodily harm. The latest sentence for possession of the class B drug will run 
consecutively to his earlier sentence.
