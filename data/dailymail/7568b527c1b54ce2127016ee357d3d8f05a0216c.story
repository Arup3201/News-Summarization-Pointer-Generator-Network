Even by football’s frenetic standards, the rise of Raheem Sterling from problem child to national treasure in under 12 months has been rapid, just like his acceleration on the pitch.

A year ago this weekend, he was a late substitute for Victor Moses in Liverpool’s 2-2 draw at Swansea City, still to be entrusted by manager Brendan Rodgers as a regular first-teamer.

Today, it’s a vastly different story. He is Liverpool’s go-to man following the departure of Luis Suarez. The undisputed centre of attention at Anfield for Saturday’s tea-time kick-off against Aston Villa.

Sterling is also the major cause for optimism about England’s future. Still only 19 but with plenty of life experience already behind him — he is already a father — Sterling puts his fantastic form down to a conscious decision to be less inhibited on the pitch.

‘Maybe 12 months ago, I wouldn’t want to get on the ball as much if I’d made a mistake. But now I’m a bit more confident,’ he says. ‘If I lose the ball I want to get on it as quickly as possible and make up for it, whereas before I would hide away and maybe only look for the ball 10 minutes later. I don’t want to give the defenders any break.

‘I sat down with my agent and went through my youth-team video footage. I saw that when I started, I’d get on the ball and within two touches would turn straight away and look to attack my opponent, but when I got into the first team, I would go for the safer option. So I went back to basics where I needed to be on the front foot and the defenders on the back foot.’

In the flesh, you are quickly reminded this is still a kid, albeit one who has had an eventful journey to this point. 

At our interview at Aintree racecourse to promote EA computer game The Sims 4, he appears nonplussed by the sudden wave of love being thrown in his direction.

Raheem Sterling was one of few positives for England at their miserable World Cup campaign

This is a lad who left his birthplace of Kingston, Jamaica, to live in England at the age of five. Growing up on a tough north-west London estate overlooked by Wembley stadium, his mum took him to play his first organised football game at the age of 10, essentially to keep him out of trouble. 

One teacher told him starkly he’d either become a star footballer or end up in prison. At 15, he took the biggest decision of his life, to leave QPR for Liverpool and get him away from the malignant influences in London.

Regular goalscoring is his next challenge and two in his first three games of the season for Liverpool suggests he’ll crack that too.

Pushed to explain why his development has been so meteoric, he also points to a meeting with Rodgers around this time last year. He’d just been cleared at Liverpool crown court of assaulting a former girlfriend when the Liverpool boss stated privately and publicly he needed ‘stability in his life’.

Sterling took a good look at himself, decided to stop going out every time friends asked and dedicated himself to being a professional. In December, he started to be given a run of games. He was unplayable when he scored twice in a 5-1 win against Arsenal in February. By the end of the season, his performances were regularly eclipsing Suarez and he was the only England player to return from the World Cup with his reputation enhanced.

‘Going into training each day, coming home and going back to training. That’s been it for me over the last 12 months,’ he says. ‘I have tried to live, sleep and eat football as the manager has told me to do.

‘When the time is right, I have a laugh and a joke with my friends on a day off, but I have had to make sacrifices and in that sense it’s been a huge step forward, completely different to how it was before. I was 18 when the manager spoke to me. I realised I’m not like any other teenager. I can’t be doing stuff any other 18 or 19-year-old was doing. I knew I had to make changes, to ensure being the best I could be.’

Surprisingly, and a little unconvincingly, Sterling insists he is not a naturally confident person. By that he probably means he would rather let others talk him up rather than do it himself. 

Brendan Rodgers told Raheem Sterling that he needed stability in his life and to focus on football

‘I am not saying I don’t think I’m good, but I’m not the type of player to have an ego or big myself up.

‘It’s been a quick turnaround for my career but that is football. It changes within seconds. I am now focusing on going to the next level. I’m determined it is only a matter of time before I get there.’

It says a lot for his growing maturity that both Rodgers and Roy Hodgson trust him to play at No 10, arguably the most important position on the pitch. Gareth Bale, for example, was much older before he was switched inside from the wing.

‘I prefer the No 10 position, but I’m still developing and not quite the complete player to play there.

‘Every time I get in there I try to take the responsibility of creating and scoring goals. I enjoy that.’

Hodgson must agree. He devised a diamond system for England’s crunch game in Basle specifically to get Sterling on the ball as much as possible.

There will be a chance to compare Sterling’s progress with Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo when Liverpool play Real Madrid in the Champions League.

‘Ronaldo has always been an idol to me,’ says Sterling. ‘But I’m not going to say any more because every time I mention a name, people say I’m comparing myself to them! Everyone wants to be like the best in the world.’

While Sterling keeps social activity to a minimum these days — ‘I’m not really a drinker’ — he does allow himself one ‘vice’, social media. ‘Why am I on Twitter? Well, I am 19 and need something to get away from football sometimes,’ he smiles.

‘It’s a way of having a laugh and a joke with my friends. You scroll past the provocative messages if they come in.’

Rodgers will be happy for him to carry on tweeting at least as long as England’s most talented teenager carries on with his otherwise ‘boring’ life of home-training ground-home.
