A Florida couple who hoped to spend a day at sea in their new boat have been rescued after a broken engine and low winds forced them to spend a week stranded off the coast. 

Bogdan Makowski, 69, and his wife Elizabeth Makowski, 61, went sailing near Anclote Key, Florida last weekend in their newly purchased 1976 Almond Hunter boat, but after setting off, the engine cut out.

At first, this didn't bother them.

'The engine stopped me after four hours. I don't care about this because I am sailing,' Mr Makowski told WTSP.

Saved! Bogdan and Elizabeth Makowski are pictured during their early-morning rescue on Saturday after they spent nearly a week at sea. Their engine cut out and, when they tried to sail, the wind also dropped

Found: Mr Makowski said that the dead engine hadn't initially bothered him. Thankfully they had told a friend they were heading to sea and they alerted the Coast Guard when the couple failed to return

But then the wind gave up on them too.

'I put the sail and I go,' he recounted. 'Another problem: no wind. I wait 24 hours for the wind and nothing.'

The couple called the boat's previous owner, who told them to contact BoatUS to get a tow. But the couple's phone's battery died and BoatUS never received a call.

They had no food on board the 27-foot boat and ran out of water on the first day.

Mr Makowski admitted that they even saved urine, but didn't have to resort to drinking it thanks to his wife finding a gallon of water in an old bucket.

Their sail was also ripped but, using the small piece remaining, the couple managed to sail from 80 miles away to 10 miles within the shore.

Thankfully, they had told a friend that they were setting sail and to expect them back by Tuesday. When she still had not heard from them by Friday, she reported them missing to the Coast Guard Station Sand Key. 

The Coast Guard found the couple in good condition at 2am ,10 miles northwest of Anclote Key. 

'We saw the blue lights from their ship and noticed that they were moving towards us,' Mr Makowski told WFLA. 'I probably lost a few pounds, my wife had some bruises but we are okay overall.' 

Their vessel was towed and the boaters were transferred safely to Anclote River Boat Ramp in Holiday, which is about 30 miles north of Tampa.

The incident hasn't put them off; the couple said they are now restoring the boat so they can head back next season.
