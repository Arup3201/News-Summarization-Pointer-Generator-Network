Health insurer Anthem Inc, which
has nearly 40 million U.S. customers, said late on Wednesday
that hackers had breached one of its IT systems and stolen
personal information relating to current and former consumers
and employees.

The No. 2 health insurer in the United States said the
breach did not appear to involve medical information or
financial details such as credit card or bank account numbers.

The information accessed during the 'very sophisticated
attack' did include names, birthdays, social security numbers,
street addresses, email addresses and employment information,
including income data, the company said.

Attack: Anthem Inc said late on Wednesday hackers had breached one of its IT systems and stolen personal information relating to current and former consumers and employees 

Anthem said that it immediately made every effort to close
the security vulnerability and reported the attack to the FBI.
Cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc said it had been hired to
help Anthem investigate the attack.

Anthem's president and CEO Joseph R. Swedish said in a letter addressed to the company's members that he was one of the affected.

'Anthem’s own associates’ personal information – including my own – was accessed during this security breach,' he said. 'We join you in your concern and frustration, and I assure you that we are working around the clock to do everything we can to further secure your data.'

Swedish said that 'Anthem has also retained Mandiant, one of the world’s leading cybersecurity firms, to evaluate our systems and identify solutions based on the evolving landscape.' 

The company did not say how many customers and staff were
affected, but the Wall Street Journal earlier reported it was
suspected that records of tens of millions of people had been
taken, which would likely make it the largest data breach
involving a U.S. health insurer.

Anthem had 37.5 million medical members as of the end of
December.

'This attack is another reminder of the persistent threats
we face, and the need for Congress to take aggressive action to
remove legal barriers for sharing cyber threat information,' U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas and chairman
of the Committee on Homeland Security, said in a statement late
Wednesday.

In a statement, the FBI said 'Speed matters when notifying law enforcement of an intrusion, as cyber criminals can quickly destroy critical evidence needed to identify those responsible. Rapid notification allows the FBI to quickly deploy our cyber experts to preserve evidence and work with a company’s incident responders to help them remediate their networks and rid their systems of harmful malware.'

The FBI had warned last August that healthcare industry
companies were being targeted by hackers, publicizing the issue
following an attack on U.S. hospital group Community Health
Systems Inc that resulted in the theft of millions of
patient records.

Medical identity theft is often not immediately identified
by patients or their provider, giving criminals years to milk
such credentials. That makes medical data more valuable than
credit cards, which tend to be quickly canceled by banks once
fraud is detected.

Security experts say cyber criminals are increasingly
targeting the $3 trillion U.S. healthcare industry, which has
many companies still reliant on aging computer systems that do
not use the latest security features.  

Anthem said it would send a letter and email to everyone
whose information was stored in the hacked database. It also set
up an informational website, www.anthemfacts.com, and will offer
to provide a credit-monitoring service. 

The company said on the website's FAQ page that 'The impacted (plan/brand) include Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Amerigroup, Caremore, Unicare, Healthlink, and DeCare.'
