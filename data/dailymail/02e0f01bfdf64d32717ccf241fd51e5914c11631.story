Top brass in the Ministry of Defence have enjoyed plush hotels and business-class travel as thousands of troops are axed to save money.

Military personnel spent £157,000 of taxpayers’ cash in three months on jaunts around the globe. The two-star officers lived the high life and charged the bill to the public.

The extraordinary details were slipped out late yesterday by the MoD, prompting claims it was trying to bury bad news.

While thousands of troops are being made redundant, top army bosses have spent £157,000 on expenses

The figures cover Major Generals Richard Nugee, James Chiswell and James Cowan, who commanded brigades in Afghanistan.

Air Vice-Marshal Phil Osborn spent up to £6,600 on a flight to Washington DC and nearly £500 in hotel bills.

Rear Admiral Mark Beverstock, the Chief of Strategic Systems Executive, charged for flights costing £5,000 – including two in business class – between Washington and London.

And Major General Richard Davis, Director General Army Recruiting and Training, billed £6,999 for a business-class flight to Ottawa, Canada.

Details of travel expenses cover July to September last year.  Critics will be astonished at the levels of spending at a time when the MoD is pushing through crippling cuts to save £4.7billion.

Around 30,000 troops have been made redundant and warships, jets, spy planes and battle tanks have been axed.
