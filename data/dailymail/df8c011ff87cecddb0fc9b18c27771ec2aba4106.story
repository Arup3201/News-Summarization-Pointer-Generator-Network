Filmed with the help of the British Forces Broadcasting Service over a three-month period during downtime and after work, the video will raise charity funds for the Swaledale Mountain Rescue Team in North Yorkshire.

The hilarious video features soldiers dancing in a portaloo, sprayed by a fire extinguisher as they dance and larking around in a giant water butt.

There is even a festive twist with many of the dancers wearing festive fancy dress including one soldier dressed in an inflatable turkey costume and wearing a Santa hat.

Since it was released in July, the original version of the song by rapper PSY has seen a meteoric rise through the music industry.

U.N General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon and royal Zara Philips are among the high profile names to get caught up in the craze and give its iconic dance a go themselves.

The insanely popular original is the most watched YouTube video of all time.

But'Afghan Style' has already been watched nearly 30,000 times on the site.
