The International Rugby Board is considering introducing strict new anti-corruption measures which would see mobile phones banned from team dressing rooms.

The sport’s governing body is eager to protect rugby from the illegal gambling and match-fixing scandals which have dogged other sports including horse racing, cricket and, in recent times, football.

On Monday, IRB chief executive Brett Gosper revealed new rules could be introduced which would see players required to hand in their phones on arrival at the ground on match-days.

‘The integrity of sport, whether it be gambling and anti-doping, is an issue for all sports and like all other sports we’re looking at options in terms of what can be the right protocols to ensure that there might not be issues that can lead to gambling,’ Gosper said.

‘That’s on the table to be investigated, we haven’t yet made a call. We’re comparing some of the protocols in other sports and we will make a call on it in the next few months.

‘We don’t want to apply anything that’s overly draconian or doesn’t take into account the normal way players use their phones but to a certain extent we have to ensure we are not taking any risks in the gambling area.’

The aim of the ban is to prevent corruption and match-fixing from players during the game
