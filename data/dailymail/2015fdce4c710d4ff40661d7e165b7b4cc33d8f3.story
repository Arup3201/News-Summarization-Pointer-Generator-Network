The Premier League may only be four games old but there have already been plenty of twists and turns. Leicester City claimed a memorable 5-3 victory against Manchester United while Manchester City held Chelsea to a 1-1 draw at the Etihad.

Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the top 10  Premier League performers from the weekend. It's no surprise that Jamie Vardy and Leonardo Ulloa top the leaderboard after brilliant performances for the Foxes, but who else makes the top 10 in our Player Performance Index PPI chart?

Jamie Vardy tops the Player Performance Index PPI chart after a brilliant display against Manchester United

10. Winston Reid, (PPI score: 33.0)

West Ham's memorable 3-1 home victory against Liverpool on Saturday night was sparked by Winston Reid's early goal after just 75 seconds.

The Hammers defender managed to make 10 clearances and three interceptions during the Premier League clash which also saw goals from Diafra Sakho and Morgan Amalfitano.

The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League.

It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices?

1. Winning performance

2. Player's performance per match

3. Appearances

4. Goals scored

5. Assists

6. Clean sheets

9. Stewart Downing, West Ham (34.1)

Stewart Downing continued his bright start to the Premier League season with another assist during West Ham's win.

The English winger also made two successful dribbles and produced two successful crosses on a memorable evening for the West Ham faithful.  

8. Nikica Jelavic, Hull City (34.7) 

Nikica Jelavic scored a stunning volley to give his side a second half lead against Newcastle on Saturday in a performance that earned the striker a 34.7 score with EA's PPI index.

The Croatian forward converted one of his two shots at St James' Park before seeing his side lose a two-goal lead after a double from Magpies striker Papiss Cisse.

7. Mile Jedinak, Crystal Palace (38.3)

Neil Warnock's Crystal Palace side claimed an impressive scalp on Sunday with Mile Jedinak at the heart of his side's 3-2 win against Everton.

Jedinak pulled his side back into the game with a 30th minute penalty while making five successful tackles as goals from Frazier Campbell and Yannick Bolasie ensured Palace would leave Goodison Park with a valuable three points.  

6. Papiss Cisse, Newcastle United (38.7)

Papiss Cisse may have finished just sixth in EA's PPI index, but his contribution will mean an awful lot more to under-fire Newcastle manager Alan Pardew.

The Senegalese frontman pulled his side and his manager's future at St James' Park back from the brink with a second half brace to earn Newcastle a 2-2 against Hull.

With the score at 2-0, Cisse scored in the 73rd and 87th minute to secure a point and keep Pardew in a job for another game.

Cisse also managed to score his two goals from his only two shots at goal.

5. Mesut Ozil, Arsenal (41.3)

Mesut Ozil has been under scrutiny for the early part of the season after a number of lackluster performances. However, the German seemed to thrive in the No 10 role on Saturday as Arsenal romped to a 3-0 win against Aston Villa.

Ozil managed one goal and one assist while completing 52 passes in Villa's half with a 92 per cent pass completion.

4. Danny Welbeck, Arsenal (41.5)

Danny Welbeck moved a step closer to proving that he can be Arsenal's main man this season with his first goal in a Gunners shirt.

Welbeck was central to Arsenal's first half salvo which saw Arsene Wenger's side three goals ahead with just 36 minutes on the clock. 

The former Manchester United man also made 25 passes in Villa's half with an impressive 96.9 per cent pass completion.

3. James Morrison, West Brom (46.8)

West Brom midfielder James Morrison scored his side's winning goal on Sunday as the Baggies grabbed a shock three points against Tottenham.

Morrison's 74th minute striker was enough to earn West Brom their first Premier League win of the season as the Scottish international controlled play with 89.4 per cent pass completion rate. 

Leicester's Leonardo Ulloa scores from the penalty spot to make it 5-3 against United on Sunday

The former Brighton striker pulled his side level with a 17th minute header before sealing Leicester's memorable victory with a penalty in the 83rd minute to give his side a 5-3 lead.

1. Jamie Vardy, Leicester City (60.9)

Jamie Vardy deservedly takes this week's top spot with a PPI score of 60.9. The Foxes forward was a constant thorn in United's side on Sunday and was vital to Leicester's victory.

Vardy managed to bag four assists as well as a goal for himself as Leicester returned a 3-1 deficit into a 5-3 victory.

Rafael and Tyler Blackett fouled Vardy to hand the hosts two penalties, which were dispatched by David Nugent and Ulloa respectively.

Vardy, who was plying his trade in the seventh tier of English football four years ago, also found the net in a frantic final half hour, as did Esteban Cambiasso, who was making his full debut.
