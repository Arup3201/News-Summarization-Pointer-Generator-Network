Being woken up early by excited children is a feeling that every parent will know all too well.

So spare a thought for this male lion in South Africa who was given a very early wake-up call by his two eager cubs.

Mburri may be the king of the beasts, but that didn't stop his children Impi and Dela from treating him like just another plaything.

This is the moment two lion cubs called Impi and Dela gave their sleepy father Mburri an early-wake up call

Zoe Cole, 24, captured the stunning pictures as the tiny cubs pounced on to the male lion and bashed him with their paws.

Aspiring wildlife photographer Zoe spotted the cubs at the Selati game reserve in South Africa as they played around on the savannah.

She said: 'I was volunteering at a private game reserve called Selati in the Limpopo Region of South Africa.

'I'd been assisting the team in monitoring, observing and collecting data on all the endangered species, one of which is a pride of lions.

'Mburri, who is the handsome male lion, was the only fully-grown male at the reserve, so he was king, never having a rival.

The adult lions were trying to sleep after a night out prowling but the playful cubs had other ideas

I'm awake: Seemingly oblivious to his father's bad mood, the cub continues batting at his mane

Cubs Impi and Dela are part of a pride of endangered lions that are carefully monitored at the nature reserve

'There are four lionesses in this pride, so Mburri had plenty to choose from.

'This is the second time I've visited but the first time I've seen the cubs - they were very cheeky, playful and curious.

'I was surprised because we didn't have to wait long as the whole family emerged out of the bush into the clearing enjoying the morning sunshine.

'The two adults sat down tired after a long night on the prowl, however Impi and Dela were rolling and tumbling full of energy.'

The photographer, originally from Italy, said the lion looked less than impressed with the early wake up call.

Back to sleep: One of Mburri's cubs hides his eyes from the morning sun having just woken him up

There are four lionesses in the pride, but there has never been another lion, meaning Mburri has never had a rival... that is until he had children

Photographer Ms Cole said Mburri was very patient with his children, but added: 'If they weren't his, I think it would have been a different story'

Zoe added: 'The cubs tried to catch their dad's attention in some play but he was not interested.

'Despite their enthusiasm he just let his offspring jump and jostle him without any problem.

'They are his two cubs, so it was not dangerous for them to be near him. If they weren't his, I think it would have been a different story.'
