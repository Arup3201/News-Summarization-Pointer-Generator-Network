A teary jury convicted a New York City parolee of murder, bringing closure to the family and friends of slain Nassau County police officer Arthur Lopez, 29.

Darrell Fuller, 34, was pronounced guilty of first- and second-degree murder, robbery and weapons charges for an October 2012 killing spree that also claimed the life of Raymond Facey near Belmont Park racetrack on Long Island.

The New York Post reported that Lopez had approached Fuller's car at a Mobil station on Long Island after watching Fuller speed away from the scene of an accident on at least one flat tire.

After a 'short exchange' at the driver's side window, Fuller burst from the car and fired what would be a fatal round into Lopez's chest.

Fuller escaped as Lopez's patrol partner, Clarence Hudson, attempted to aid Lopez, who was not wearing a bulletproof vest.

Lopez was later pronounced dead at the hospital.

'This was a police officer that was a building block of this police department, the future of this police department,' Police Benevolent Association president James Carver said after the trial.

'That is what his life was all about was helping the public,' he added.

There Fuller attacked Raymond Facey, 52, who was parked on the shoulder talking on cellphone with his daughter.

The family heard Fuller pull Facey, a grandfather and father of four, out of his Toyota and shoot him once in the head, leaving his body on the side of the road.

One of Facey's twin daughters, Abbigail Jones, 23, told reporters outside the courthouse, 'We can't bring Daddy back, but this is such a blessing that we know who did it.'

'We know we got the right person.'

After the spree, Fuller fled to Queens, eventually ditching Facey's car before being arrested hours later.

Authorities said he first went to a nearby day care center, where he called a friend to pick him up.

According to prosecutors, that friend later shot Fuller in an attempt to make it appear that Fuller had been a victim of the carnage.

Fuller served four years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted murder in 2005, authorities said.

He was jailed again in 2010 after violating his parole on a drug arrest and was released in 2011, prosecutors said.

The trial extended over seven weeks and testimony was limited to three days a week because Fuller needed the other two days to receive kidney dialysis treatments.

Nassau County Court Judge Jerald Carter scheduled sentencing for September 5.
