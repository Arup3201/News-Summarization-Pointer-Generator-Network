Keith Curle left Carlisle United supporters in no doubt about the relationship breakdown between the club and wantaway midfielder Alex Marrow.

Manager Curle didn't mince his words in branding the player a 'sick-note' and revealed that he's asked Marrow to leave Brunton Park without Carlisle paying up the remainder of his one-year contract.

But Curle asserts that while the 24-year-old wants to depart, he is sitting on his contract and wants a pay-off.

Carlisle United currently sit just above the League Two relegation zone in 22nd position, having won seven and drawn three of their 24 league games this season.

The Cumbrians were knocked out in the first round of both the FA Cup and the Capital One Cup.

Carlisle reached the second round of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy and were beaten on penalties by Tranmere.

Marrow returned to the League Two strugglers this week after being absent for a month with illness.

'Alex Marrow is back with us after his sick note period expired,' Curle said. 'The situation with him is that Alex wants to leave the football club. I also want Alex to leave the football club.

'We're going through a process of finding the best way for him to leave the club which is financially beneficial to both parties.

'Fortunately for Alex, while he is here, and doesn't want to be here, he still gets paid. Unfortunately for me while Alex is here, and doesn't want to be here, I've still got to pay him.

'I've asked Alex to leave and not take the money he's owed. That has been my negotiating strategy. We've obviously hit a stumbling block on that.

'In the short term, the beauty of what we've got with working for a very honourable football club is that we will continue to pay Alex for his services, even though he doesn't want to be here.'

Marrow has only played four league games since a free transfer from Blackburn Rovers in the summer. 

Meanwhile, winger Danny Kearns - who has been absent from the club to 'refocus his mind' - was also the subject of some straight talking from Curle.

'I didn't ask him to go away,' Curle added. 'Being completely honest, Danny wasn't happy, but nor was I. And usually when there's two unhappy people, there needs to be a separation.

'We're both unhappy about the same things. Danny's unhappy because he's not playing, and I was unhappy because Danny wasn't playing. And I know the reasons why Danny wasn't playing.

'He's not in my thoughts for the weekend because he's not fit.'

Carlisle face consecutive relegations if they cannot arrest a slump in form which sees them just two points off the bottom two in the basement division.
