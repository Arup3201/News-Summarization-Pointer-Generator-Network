A driver left stranded in his car after it became stuck in floodwater was rescued by a digger - just moments before his vehicle became dislodged.

The man had been attempting to cross a river in Fengje County in Chongqing, southwest China, on Tuesday when his SUV was washed away about 30 metres by the torrent. 

The swift river water, which rose sharply after heavy rains, constantly lashed the vehicle, forcing the driver to open the door and lean out, as the drama unfolded just after 5pm.

A driver left stranded in his car after it became stuck in floodwater was rescued by a digger - just moments before his vehicle became dislodged

He had been attempting to cross a river in Fengje County in Chongqing, south-west China, on Tuesday

Rescue workers used a digger bucket to lift him out and brought him to shore

Rescue workers offered him a rubber ring attached to a rope and drove an excavator into the waterway.

They then used the digger bucket to lift him out and brought him to shore.

The vehicle was washed further away for about 10 metres just as the driver was rescued.

It too was eventually dragged to safety - no doubt suffering slightly more than a flooded engine.
