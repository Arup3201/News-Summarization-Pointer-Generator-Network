TV presenter and Sheffield United patron Charlie Webster has said she will quit her role at the club if they re-sign convicted rapist Ched Evans.

Miss Webster, a member of the Justice Ministry's Victims' Panel, said she had a 'responsibility' and 'duty' to oppose the player's return and spoke out against his 'lack of remorse'. 

But she was immediately branded a 'hypocrite' by Evans' sister Kylie, who retweeted a message the presenter posted last month saying she wanted to get a photograph with former heavyweight boxing champion and convicted rapist Mike Tyson.

On September 10, the presenter tweeter her regret at not getting a photo of convicted rapist Mike Tyson

Evans' sister Kylie called the Sky Sports presenter a 'hypocrite' for the tweet about the former boxer

The 25-year-old former Sheffield United player and Welsh international was released from jail this week after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel.

Webster, who has said that she was sexually assaulted as a teenager, told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'You will have young people cheering him on when he scores a goal. Not under my name, under my club or community.' 

She added: 'He says he is innocent, he has shown no remorse. 

'Very few people would be able to walk back into the same job as they did before being a convicted rapist.'

She went on to say on Sky News: 'He hasn't accepted responsibility for what he's done. Even if he doesn't think it's rape, his behaviour was still morally wrong and he still hasn't said sorry to the victim. 

'I am concerned about what message it sends out to the community and society to re-sign a convicted rapist.'

In reply Evans' sister, who also maintains the footballer's innocence, pointed to a tweet which Miss Webster posted on September 10. 

It reads: 'Just bumped into Mike Tyson in the hotel lobby as I was randomly talking about him! I chickened out on asking for a photo...damn.'

Ms Evans tweeted: 'This is the same Charlie Webster that's just threatened to leave United. Hypocrite.'

Tyson was convicted of rape in 1992 after an incident the previous year and subsequently served three years of a six-year sentence.

Responding to the Mike Tyson tweet, Miss Webster said: 'I am not going to stand her and say she said this, I said that. I am not going to comment on her but I have apologised and find it very sad that's taken away from what I said this morning.

'I did not think about that tweet at the time and I'm not proud of that tweet but the response has been another example of berating someone for speaking out against rape. 

'But I am not thinking about Mike Tyson. I am thinking about Ched Evans. The reason people don't stand up to rape is because they get abused on Twitter for it. 

'The victim has had to take on a new identity and had a hate campaign against her. Nobody should have to go through that. I would ask the community to get behind the victim.'  

The former Sheffield United striker was jailed in April 2012 for raping a woman in a Rhyl hotel room

Evans, a former Manchester City youth player, was jailed in April 2012 for raping the woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. 

The striker denied raping the woman but was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court.

He admitted having sex with her, but the woman told the jury she had no memory of the incident.

The prosecution said the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was too drunk to consent to sexual intercourse.

His friend, Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, also admitted having sex with the victim but was found not guilty of the same charge.

An appeal against Evans's conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012.

Since leaving Wymott Prison near Leyland in Lancashire a statement released on Evans' behalf says that he will make a 'very personal and profound statement' on the issue next week.

Last night, an online petition against Evans return to Sheffield United had attracted more than 150,000 signatures.

The petition, set up by feminist campaigner Jean Hatchet, calls on Kevin McCabe, chairman of Sheffield United, where Evans played until he was jailed, to 'refuse to reinstate Ched Evans as a player'.

Yesterday, a steady stream of well-wishers called at his family home ahead of an expected celebration, with relatives having flown in from all over the world for the reunion.
