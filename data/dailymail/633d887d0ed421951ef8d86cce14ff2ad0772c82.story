An NFL star who is used to working against opposing wide receivers now holds a world record more befitting of someone who works with a wide-angle lens.

Arizona Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson set a Guinness World Record with 1,449 selfies in an hour while visiting Deer Valley High School in Phoenix on Tuesday.

The 24-year-old defensive player took an average of about 24 selfies per minute during his record-breaking effort.

 The shutdown corner set the record while visiting Deer Valley High School in Phoenix, Arizona on Tuesday 

The previous record was a mere 657 snaps. 

His speed isn't all that surprising considering he already holds the NFL record for most punt return touchdowns in a single season.

The fifth overall pick of the 2011 NFL Draft also has 15 interceptions in his four-year career.

Students had only two seconds to pose with the former Louisiana State University player and Peterson was required to take every snap himself.

Peterson was able to shatter the record even though hundreds of his pictures were disqualified because they didn't meet the selfie requirements established by Guinness. 

In order to count towards the record, the selfie had to show Peterson and another person.

Each picture also had to feature the neck and head of the subjects as well as a portion of Peterson's arm.

'This is very tiring,' Peterson said while breaking the record, Yahoo Sports reported. 

'Much more tiring than I thought it would be, but I'm having fun.'

Peterson went after the record as part of NBC Sports Digital's social media campaign at Super Bowl XLIX.

The four-time Pro Bowler is working as the group's social media correspondent during Super Bowl week.

The Super Bowl will be at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on Sunday. 

The New England Patriots are hoping to win the big game for the fourth time, while the reigning champion Seattle Seahawks are attempting to win it for the second straight year.
