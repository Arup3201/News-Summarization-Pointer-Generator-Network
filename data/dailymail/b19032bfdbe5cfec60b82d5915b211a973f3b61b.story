Clive Turner, pictured, died at his home in Rossett, north Wales after suffering a haemorrhage in his digestive tract, just hours after being released with constipation

A pensioner died after waiting five-and-a-half hours for an ambulance - and a further two hours to be seen in hospital before being incorrectly diagnosed.

Clive Turner died at his home in Rossett, north Wales after suffering a haemorrhage in his digestive tract, just hours after being released with constipation.

The night before, the 73-year-old had waited five-and-a-half hours for an ambulance to be made available before waiting two more hours to be seen at Wrexham Maelor Hospital. 

An inquest heard he had suffered with constipation in the week leading up to his death.

On March 25, an ambulance was called at 4pm after he reported suffering pain, but it was not until 9.30pm that an ambulance was available.

A first responder paramedic arrived to Mr Turner one hour and 27 minutes after the initial 999 call and a healthcare worker stayed with him until the main ambulance arrived.

Mr Turner arrived at Wrexham Maelor Hospital just after 9.50pm but was not seen until almost midnight, by Dr Tatiana Rooney from the emergency department.

That night, an abdominal X-ray was ordered for Mr Turner, who worked in engineering and as a ground catering manager at Liverpool and Everton football clubs, which found no signs of bowel obstruction.

Dr Rooney diagnosed Mr Turner with constipation and, during the early hours of March 26, discharged him from hospital. 

But shortly before 1.25pm that day Mr Turner died at his home.

A post-mortem examination found he had a haemorrhage in his digestive tract and coroner John Gittins said he had been incorrectly diagnosed as constipated.

The cause of death was listed as a gastrointestinal haemorrhage, as a result of ischaemic bowel owing to atherosclerosis - or a clogging of the arteries.

In evidence, Dr Rooney said Mr Turner's main complaint was abdominal pain but he appeared comfortable and his pain score was recorded at two, which is deemed 'mild'.

She said she had not asked if he had taken any pain relief as she relied on the ambulance for that.

Mr Gittins gave a narrative conclusion at the hearing in Wrexham but made reference to the death of Fred Pring, who died at his home in Mynydd Isa, near Mold, in March 2013 after waiting 48 minutes for an ambulance.

At Mr Pring's inquest in January, Mr Gittins said it could not be 'established with certainty' if Mr Pring would have survived if the ambulance had arrived sooner.

But he said it was 'probable' if it had arrived within eight minutes he would have lived long enough to be transported to hospital for further medical treatment.

He said the loss of even a single life to a potential delay was unacceptable and he was writing to the Welsh Ambulance Trust and Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board to tell them about his concerns that - unless action was taken - risks of deaths would continue.

The Welsh Ambulance Trust responded on March 19 - a week before Mr Turner's death - saying problems with delays were being tackled.

During his conclusion, Mr Gittins said the situation cannot continue. 

He said: 'I know from the evidence he has undoubtedly suffered in the hours leading up to his death, as a result of not being treated quickly enough.'

'Although the death was not as a result of that delay, I am concerned about that delay.

'Changes must happen and they must happen soon. 

'My intention is to seek assurances from them (the Welsh Ambulance NHS Trust and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board) and to receive updates, tables and averages times of delays and handovers.'

Mr Gittins said Mr Turner's case could be a 'catalyst for change'.

The coroner said he would raise a regulation 28 report regarding Dr Rooney's absence of knowledge regarding whether Mr Turner had been administered pain relief, as well as her absence of knowledge on the safeguarding of discharging patients.

A Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board spokesman said: 'We would like to express our sincere condolences to the family of Clive Turner. 

'We fully accept the coroner's verdict and will ensure the appropriate action is taken to address the issues raised at the inquest.

'We are working very closely with the Welsh Ambulance Service to minimise delays at emergency departments wherever possible.'
