Bad blood between Manchester City and CSKA Moscow has spilled over into the dressing room after it emerged the controversial Russian club didn’t even feed Manuel Pellegrini’s players after last month’s game in Eastern Europe.

City and Wednesday’s opponents Moscow have been at loggerheads since last season’s Champions League fixtures when the Barclays Premier League champions complained that midfielder Yaya Toure had been racially abused.

Last month’s 2-2 draw at Arena Khimki was played behind closed doors as a result of UEFA-imposed punishment for that incident and others, although City subsequently complained that local fans had gained access by buying sponsors' tickets on the black market.

Manchester City drew 2-2 in Moscow, with Sergio Aguero scoring the opening goal, but CSKA failed to provide Manuel Pellegrini's men with adequate levels of food after the match as the fued between the sides grows

Now it has emerged that CSKA took the petty feuding to new levels last time by refusing to provide anything substantial for City’s players to eat in the visitors’ dressing room two weeks ago.

It is customary in football for the home club to provide hot food high in carbohydrate for both sets of players to snack on after a game to help them replace lost energy. This is particularly important in European games when teams often have long plane journeys home immediately after matches.

In the modern age, clubs at this high level usually provide a range of food including pizza, pasta, muffins and doughnuts. CSKA, however, laid on only a few bits of fruit for City to eat, leaving Pellegrini and his players in a rage as they left the stadium.

On Wednesday at the Etihad Stadium it is understood that City will not sink to CSKA’s level by retaliating in kind but Pellegrini’s players are sure to use it as motivation as they head in to a game they really must win if they are to have any chance of reaching the last eight.

The atmosphere in the City boardroom is also bound to be less than cordial at the Etihad after recent incidents between the clubs.

Last season CSKA’s top-ranking officials responded to City’s complaint about racism by turning up to an official reception before the subsequent game in Manchester wearing jeans, trainers and T-shirts. Usual custom would have seen both sets of directors in shirt and tie.

Last month, meanwhile, only one of City’s top brass - sporting director Txiki Begiristain - actually bothered to go the CSKA game.

The next highest-ranking official on the trip was ambassador Mike Summerbee as the likes of chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak and chief executive Ferran Soriano stayed at home.

Since then the clubs have been in dispute again, with City complaining about the 300 fans they believe infiltrated the game at Khimki.
