When Simon Tibbs took over at St Faith’s Church, he hoped his congregation would evoke the Christian spirit by welcoming him into the parish.

But within nine months the priest had been driven out of his post by disgruntled worshippers after he tried to crackdown on their drinking sessions.

Annoyed that  he was trying to ban boozing after services and  making changes at the church, they began a whispering campaign against him.

Revd Simon Tibbs was 'hounded out' of the church because he attempted to enforce a booze ban

Last September the 41-year-old cleric, who was dubbed the ‘cyber priest’ after blogging  about a pilgrimage on social networking sites, agreed to step down from the church, in Crosby, Liverpool.

But an investigation into his treatment yesterday revealed several members of  the congregation behaved in a way ‘not befitting of a Christian community’ and effectively bullied him into leaving.

Fr Tibbs replaced an elderly Sunday school leader

Retired bishop the Right Reverend Stephen Lowe was appointed to look into the ‘serious relationship difficulties’ between the vicar and his worshippers at St Faith’s, which once counted the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr  Robert Runcie, among its congregation.

His report said Mr Tibbs unearthed a drinking culture at the church which was akin to a ‘social club’ and blamed an ‘inner circle’ of long-standing, conservative members of the congregation, opposed to change, for his ousting.

‘There was a culture among a very small number of members of St Faith’s that  bullying and the undermining of Simon Tibbs are acceptable as a means to an end  - his removal,’ the Bishop said.

‘Members enjoy Anglo-Catholic worship of a traditional kind but have little interest in either Church growth or mission to the community in which they are  set.

‘Simon challenged something about the culture of St Faith’s and upset some key members of the ‘inner circle’ of St Faith’s power. They felt the maintenance of the historical legacy of the church rested with them and any attempt to change it should meet with fierce and organised resistance.

‘Simon’s critics clearly believe ‘the Church that trained an Archbishop of Canterbury’ and ‘has the biggest quota in the Deanery’ should remain untouched.’

The report also found evidence of ‘political division’ between the left-leaning  priest and a small number of ‘very right-wing’ worshippers.

Originally from Sussex, Mr Tibbs studied English Literature at Edinburgh University, and spent time teaching English abroad, before being ordained as a  priest in 2005.

Both his father and grandfather were also priests. In 2010 he completed a 400 mile pilgrimage from Edinburgh to the shrine of St  Mary the Virgin in Walsingham, Norfolk, to raise money for Christian Aid, which  he chronicled on Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and Youtube.

He took over at St Faith’s in January last year after reading about Dr  Runcie’s links to the area and moved into the vicarage with his dog, Poppy.

Originally from Sussex, both Rev Simon’s father and grandfather were also ordained priests.

He was ordained as a priest in 2005 and took postings in Edinburgh, South African and Bedford.

In
 2010 the priest got his nickname 'cyber priest' on the BBC after he 
used Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and Youtube to to detail a 400 mile 
traditional Christian pilgrimage he made from Edinburgh to the shrine of
 St Mary the Virgin in Walsingham, Norfolk to raise money for Christian 
Aid.

He took over as vicar in St Faiths in January last year and moved into the vicarge with his dog Poppy.

He
 described the church its website as an 'outward-looking inclusive 
community formed in the liberal Catholic tradition of the Church of 
England'.

During his tenure Rev Simon would encourage more family oriented services to persuade young people to join the church.

He
 held 'pet blessing' services with reports of dogs, cats, rabbits, 
guinea pigs, tortoises, hamsters and even snakes sitting in the pews 
with their owners.

At the 
time of his appointment Rev Simon said: 'I came up to visit 
and just fell in love with the area and the people here who all seem 
amazingly warm and friendly.

'What really struck me as a southerner coming up here was how people are so willing to strike up a conversation with you.'

At the time of his appointment Mr Tibbs said: ‘I knew all about Rev Runcie’s background in Crosby and the remarkable life he had. I came up to visit and  just fell in love with the area and the people here who all seem amazingly warm  and friendly.

‘What really struck me as a southerner coming up here was how people are so  willing to strike up a conversation with you.’

Shortly after his arrival, Mr Tibbs began holding more family oriented services  to persuade young people to join the church.

He also held ‘’pet blessing’’ services with reports of dogs, cats, rabbits,  guinea pigs, tortoises, hamsters and even snakes sitting in the pews with their  owners.

But some parishioners were unhappy with his methods, with one claiming Fr Simon  was ‘not blessed with skills to develop relationships’ and that he ‘upset  several parishioners’ when he sacked the church’s elderly Sunday School teacher.

Mr Tibbs is continuing as a minister at St Mary’s Church, also Crosby. Following his resignation, he said: ‘This has been a very difficult period for  me and I am grateful for all those who have supported me. I have made many  friends at St Faith’s and I know there are many who appreciate what I’ve been  trying to do.

‘I now wish to devote my energy to my fruitful ministry at St Mary’s as I seek  to move forward in my ministry.’

The Bishop of Warrington, the Right Reverend Richard Blackburn, said he was ‘greatly saddened’ by the findings of the report and that bullying would not be  tolerated in the Diocese of Liverpool.

‘It is clear that a new fire needs to be kindled at St Faith’s,’ he said. ‘We  must rebuild and we shall rebuild St Faith’s so that it becomes a vibrant,  beating heart of mission.’
