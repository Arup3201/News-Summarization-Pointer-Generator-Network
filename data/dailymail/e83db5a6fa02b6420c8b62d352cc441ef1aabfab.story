Comotion: A meeting of Staffordshire bull terriers turned into a brawl in Halesowen, West Midlands

Their pet dogs have an unfortunate reputation for aggression, but now it’s angry bull terrier breeders who are in the dog house – after their club meeting erupted into a furious row.

Insults and punches were said to have been exchanged at the annual meeting of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club, and police are investigating after a 56-year-old woman complained that she was assaulted.

The incident resulted in the club president and other officers resigning on the spot.

The drink-fuelled events were the culmination of a long-standing row over a vote for a club officer at the previous year’s meeting.

About 90 people turned up at Cradley Labour Club in Halesowen, West Midlands, last month for the meeting.

According to the club, one of its aims is to ‘foster a feeling of fellowship among fanciers’. But trouble started when president Barbara Beaufoy was asked by member Marie Stokes, from Walsall, why there was no record in the minutes of concerns about the handling of the vote for the officer in 2014.

A witness, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘Mrs Beaufoy said, “Sit down, you silly little girl. We don’t have to listen to scum like you”. Marie then stormed out.’

The witness said that as Mrs Stokes left, another delegate, Graham Hyde, started slow hand-clapping and chanting: ‘Out! Out! Out!’

Mr Hyde – who is approved by the Kennel Club to judge Staffie shows – was asked by club member Karon Jackson, from Cannock, Staffordshire, to keep order. 

The witness said: ‘He started shouting at her and arguing with her because she’d asked him to sit down. Then I heard someone say he’d hit Karon – he’d arm-punched her in the chest.’

Another source, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘We are working hard to improve the image of Staffies and this happens. We think it was because the bar was open and the meeting went to pieces after people had a few drinks.’

Mr Hyde, 57, denied hitting Mrs Jackson and said he was assaulted.

‘There was no way I landed a finger on Karon Jackson,’ he said. ‘I was verbally and physically attacked. I admit I applauded and shouted when Marie Stokes walked out because I was glad to see her leave.’

The meeting descended into chaos when Mrs Beaufoy and the other club officers resigned and walked out.

Mrs Jackson has made a formal statement to Staffordshire Police. Neither she nor Mrs Stokes were available for comment.

West Midlands Police said: ‘We have been made aware of an allegation of assault.’

A Kennel Club spokeswoman said: ‘We are aware of the situation but cannot comment further.’

Mrs Beaufoy said: ‘The Kennel Club is dealing with the matter.’
