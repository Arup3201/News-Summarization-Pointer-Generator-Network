A family cat that ran away from the vet’s to avoid a round of jabs has re-appeared – eight years later. 

Jesse, a ginger tomcat, was 18 months old when he escaped from his cage. 

Owners Lesley and Colin Corbett and their daughters Grace and Saskia searched the area for days and put up posters – but they gave up hope of ever seeing him again as the years went by.

Then last month they received a call from the vet who said a client had brought them the cat after he noticed it hanging around his house.

Apart from a minor leg injury, Jesse was in good health, and the vet was able to trace the Corbetts in Mow Cop, Staffordshire, because their pet had been microchipped.

Mrs Corbett, 48, said: ‘Grace was six when he went missing. She was devastated because he was a present for her.

'My daughters burst into tears as soon as I walked through the door with him – they have never forgotten him.’

'We have no idea where Jesse had been for eight years but we are so happy to have him back.

'We really thought there was no way he would come back after this long.

'At first he didn’t appear to recognise us. But now that he’s been in the same house with everyone for a week, he’s beginning to realise who we are.'
