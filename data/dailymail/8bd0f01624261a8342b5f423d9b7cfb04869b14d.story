A great-grandmother who was the oldest member of the Royal British Legion and held the record for being the world's oldest paraglider has died at 106 years old.

Peggy McAlpine from Stirling, Scotland, was 104 when she became the world's oldest paraglider.

At 101, Daredevil Peggy, as she became known, enjoyed a ride on a powerful Harley Davidson motorcycle. And years earlier she celebrated her 80th birthday doing a bungee jump.

But Peggy's fun-filled life of extreme pursuits and daring exploits came to an end last Friday December 6 when she passed away at her adopted home of Karaman, Kyrenia, in northern Cyprus.

Peggy, who had two children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, died of pneumonia following a bout of flu.

The Scot's late husband Thomas, who died of cancer in 1980, was a member of the wealthy McAlpine construction business family.

Peggy had a colourful life and her daughter Elizabeth Forsyth, 77, was caught up in the scandal 
surrounding the costly collapse of his Polly Peck business empire as an employee of jailed tycoon Asil Nadir.

Today the Royal British Legion in London confirmed Peggy was their oldest member.

An RBL standard bearer from the Legion's branch in Kyrenia, northern Cyprus, will attend her funeral in Karaman tomorrow.

Peggy, born in October 1907, had revealed she ‘loved heights' from a young age.

She recalled her first time on an aeroplane was as the passenger of aviation pioneer Sir Alan Cobham in the late 1920s.

Highlighting her passion for ‘danger', Peggy entered the Guinness Book of Records in 2007 for being the oldest person to take part in paragliding at the age of 100.

Her record was broken in 2011 by 101-year-old American womant Mary Allen Hardison.

But Peggy, despite being wheelchair-bound, was determined to get her record back and in April 2012 she leapt from a 2,400ft peak in the Kyrenia mountain range in northern Cyprus.

She was in tandem on a paraglider with pilot Ozgur Gokasan after helpers carried her from her wheelchair to be attached to him.

Peggy said at the time: 'I enjoyed every minute of it. It was better than the last time. I would certainly like to do it again - especially if anyone takes my record.'

Her adventure was recorded on video and posted on YouTube and she celebrated with a glass of champagne.

Peggy said she first got a taste for extreme sports at the age of 80 when her grandchildren talked her into trying bungee jumping at a show in Essex.

'I climbed to the top and looked down and saw the people like ants and my heart sank,' she said.

'But I'd gone so far, I couldn't stop. So I stepped on the platform and drew up my courage and leaped from the top.'

Peggy's friend Keith Lloyd, 72, a fellow member of the RBL in Kyrenia, commented on her passing.

'She was a very warm lady but also very feisty. She never lost her sense of humour and bubbly nature even when she was confined to a wheelchair,' he said.

'She had a wonderful retirement, full of adventurous pursuits.

'I
 remember after her frist paragliding record was broken she said to her 
daughter Elizabeth, ‘Well, we can't have that, can we?' Of course, she 
went and did it again and regained her record.

'I knew Peggy for 10 years. She lived in a beautiful house in the village of Karaman and was very happy there.

'She was one of the early members of the Kyrenia branch of the Royal British Legion.

'She felt very happy to be part of an organisation which is the only one in northern Cyprus to have the Queen as its patron.'

A spokesman for the Royal British Legion in London said: 'Peggy was our oldest member based on those whose dates of birth we know of. We were very sad to hear of her death.'

Major Brian Thomas MBE, chairman of the Kyrenia branch of the RBL, said: 'Peggy was such a well loved woman, a truly remarkable person. She had so much spirit.

'We are expecting more than 200 people to attend her funeral.'

He said she was the oldest known member of the RBL although there may be 'one or two' elder ones from World War One who have no record of their exact dates of birth.

Peggy became involved with the RBL in Kyrenia through her son-in-law Mike Forsyth, who was in the RAF.
