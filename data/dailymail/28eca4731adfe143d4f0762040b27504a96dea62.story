Police are to investigate claims that Sir Jimmy Savile and an accomplice ran a sex ring at the BBC.

The Mail has been told that a BBC employee was allegedly given the task of procuring girls for the presenter and other men to molest.

The member of staff sometimes attacked them himself, it is alleged. Gary Glitter has already been accused of being a member of the sex ring.

'Sex ring': Around 40 women have now come forward to allege that they were raped or molested by the late Jimmy Savile

Now two women have separately named the former BBC employee. One, a former beauty queen, claims she was raped by him on BBC premises.

The second woman, Kim Anderson, claims Savile's alleged accomplice invited her on to a tour bus to meet the star when she was waitressing at a Marylebone drinking club as a 19-year-old.

About 40 women have now stepped forward to allege they were raped or molested by the late Jim’ll Fix It star.

As the crisis threatened to engulf the BBC, newly-appointed director general George Entwistle last night wrote to all his staff urging them to help the police.

He promised: ‘I am absolutely determined that we will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to support the police. I know I can rely on your co-operation.’

Last night Savile’s alleged accomplice told the Mail: ‘Absolutely not’, when asked if he had committed rape.

Until now, the corporation had assumed the star was working alone when he allegedly abused girls in the 1960s and 1970s. 

Yesterday the beauty queen - named only as Sandra - and Mrs Anderson independently named the BBC employee they say was working as an accomplice with the Jim’ll Fix It star.

Their accounts follow earlier statements from women who say they saw Savile and others assaulting girls in his BBC dressing room.

Sandra was 23 when she won a beauty contest and wrote to Savile asking for work experience – an offer he quickly took up.

She said she was invited to Savile’s caravan in 1970, which he kept in the car park outside the BBC studios in West London.

At the time, Savile worked for Radio One. After discussing her career, she says Savile started ‘to get heavy with her’. The pair had sex in the caravan on a double bed draped with a goat-skin rug. She said: ‘I certainly didn’t fancy him. I just thought “this might make me famous” – it all happened very quickly. I just thought he was a bit of a dirty old man.’

 

'He quickly tried it on with me...before he forced me on to the carpet'

But a week later, she received a call from Savile’s accomplice, inviting her back to the BBC. She said she attended a preview of The Man Who Haunted Himself, a movie starring Roger Moore, with Saville and the BBC worker.

Afterwards, she was invited to the alleged accomplice’s BBC ‘office’ – which she described as more of a storeroom – and Savile ‘disappeared’. ‘He quickly tried it on with me, saying something like “let’s have a kiss and cuddle” before he forced me on to the carpet,’ said Sandra.

She said he forced her on to her hands and knees and raped her on the floor of a storeroom, ignoring her repeated pleas for him to stop.

‘I remember him locking the door behind me which I thought was strange. It was at the BBC. All I can remember about it was he was very rough and forceful and it hurt a lot. I pleaded with him to stop, repeatedly saying “no” – but was just told to keep my voice down. There must have been people around because I could hear radio shows going on and he told me not to make any noise. I felt so dirty on the journey home afterwards.

‘There is no doubt in my mind that this was all planned – with him and Jimmy. Jimmy must have said something to him to make him think he could have sex with me as well. I didn’t understand it at the time but it is obvious now why he got me there.’

The second woman, Kim Anderson, was a
 19-year-old waitress at a drinking club in Marylebone who said she was 
invited by Savile’s accomplice to meet the star on a tour bus.

Mrs
 Anderson, now 53, said the moment she arrived, she was ushered through a
 curtained-off section at the back of the bus, where Savile was waiting.
 ‘I had to fight him off,’ she said. ‘Jimmy Savile was definitely trying
 to have sex with me on the couch. I sat down to talk to him, and he 
lunged at me.

‘He 
wanted me to touch him, and he lunged at me and kissed me. I went back 
out to where everyone was sitting and this [accomplice], who idolised 
Jimmy Savile, told me to go back in there. I didn’t.’ Last night the Mail put the allegations in full to the former BBC employee.

He
 said of the rape allegation: ‘Absolutely not.’ He claimed he could not 
remember a drinking club in Marylebone or Savile ever using a ‘tour 
bus’. He said: ‘I haven’t got the greatest memory but I don’t remember 
any of this. I can’t see why the accusations have been made. I have 
never raped anyone in my life.’

He
 added: ‘I knew Jimmy had girlfriends around the country – but I was 
totally unaware of any under-aged children. Asked if he ‘idolised’ 
Savile he replied: ‘Yeah – I thought a lot about Jim.’

Last
 night a BBC spokesman said: ‘This is another horrifying allegation and 
we would urge anybody in possession of information of this sort to take 
it to the police who are co-ordinating the investigation.’

BBC director general George Entwistle
 sent an email to all BBC staff telling them ‘full co-operation’ with 
the police was ‘vital’ and urging them to come forward.

He said he was ‘absolutely determined’ in leaving ‘no stone unturned’ in its efforts to support the police investigation.

Mr Entwistle, who met police yesterday, wrote to staff: ‘I wanted to write to you at the end of what has been a difficult week for the BBC, following allegations from a number of women that Jimmy Savile sexually abused them when they were young teenagers during the 1960s and 70s.

‘Like everyone who works here, I was appalled by the things I saw in the ITV documentary. I am determined that the corporation will do absolutely everything it can to help find out what happened.’ He added: ‘I want to make it clear that full co-operation with the police on this matter is vital. If any staff member past or present knows anything they think might help I would urge them to come forward.’

The BBC’s investigations unit is made up of former policemen and military staff, whose duties include the security of staff and the security of the corporation’s buildings. They are said to be carrying out ‘deep analysis’ of all the stored archives at the corporation from around the period.

Sources said there was now a forensic examination of documents relating to BBC programmes going back for more than 40 years. Last night Jim Gamble, a former child protection police chief, told Channel 4 News that the Scotland Yard inquiry must identify those who were ‘complicit’ in the abuse and those who ‘conspired to cover it up’.
