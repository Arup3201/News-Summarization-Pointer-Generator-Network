Madcap Matt Cotterell has created a unique memento of 2014 - by taking a selfie every day of the year and posting the pictures on Facebook.

The 27-year-old set himself the challenge to take a daily snap of himself to document his activities over the last 12 months.

The 365 snaps include selfies with relatives and professional footballers and DJs, at family weddings and on holiday.

Madcap wannabe DJ Matt Cotterell took a picture of himself every day for a year so he can remember 2014

Matt, who works at Western Power Distribution, posted his first picture on 1 January last year of him posing at his favourite football club Wolverhampton Wanderers FC.

He managed to secure his sporting heroes, former Wolves legend, Steve Bull and the team's striker Nouha Dicko, for two photos.

Matt's selection of snaps also acts as a reminder of the fads and crazes that defined 2014, and included the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, which took the web by storm throughout August.

Matt, of Codsall, Staffs, said: 'The idea started off as a joke suggestion really but my friends seemed to like it and encouraged me to take it up.

'I'm not a keen photographer by any means and at first I was struggling for ideas but by the end of January I couldn't give up, I was in too deep.

Matt went on to say: 'I started the year working at the Wolves ticket office, and got to meet some footballing idols, like Steve Bull and Nouha Dicko.

'I have had a lot of fun, I guess I picked quite a good year in general. Looking back, I seem to have spent the majority of my time with friends, family and work colleagues.

'The Ice Bucket Challenge one was very nearly a disaster. My dad shot the video and he isn't very good with phones, so he stopped filming pretty much as soon as the water went over my head.

'I had to screen shot it and take a photo from that, which luckily worked out pretty well.' 

Matt said that this picture - taken with his Great Aunty Betty Austin and his Great Aunty Pat -  was especially poignant as his Aunty Betty died not long after the picture was taken

As an aspiring DJ, Matt took the opportunity to take part in a meet-and-greet with North London electro duo Gorgon City during his weekend at Reading. 

He said: 'While I was at Reading festival, there was a signing tent where acts will sit for a couple of hours and meet their fans.

'I am a big fan of Gorgon City and was planning to go and see them later on in the day. As I walked past the tent, I noticed they were doing a signing but it looked pretty much finished, everyone was packing up.

On his last day at work for Wolves FC Matt persuaded his colleagues to take part in his picture 

'I had a word with security and told them about my selfie challenge and they let me through. The guys seemed to think it was a good idea too and were more than happy to pose. My friend said that had to be my photo for that day. 

'Then at Birmingham's BPM, which is a three day electronic music event, I got a photo with Chewbacca from Star Wars.'

Matt said that his family would regularly feature in his pictures: 'There are loads of pictures with family as well. We are a very close family. We like to get together a lot anyway and take photographs so they were happy to join in. 

The wannabe DJ always had his camera on hand to document his goings on, taking this snap on a night out

Some of Matt's friends were less keen to be part of his mission to take a seflie every day for a year

Matt had a great time at Reading festival taking snaps with his friends along the way

'One especially significant photograph shows me with my great aunt Betty Austin, who had cancer and died a few months after the picture was taken.' 

Other snaps include Matt taking part in the Wolverhampton half marathon dressed as the 118 man as well as pictures of himself with girlfriend Kelly, 27, on holiday.

Matt said: 'It's strange that we got together last December so she has only known me as this guy who takes photographs every day.

But Kelly's not too keen on Matt doing the challenge again this year: 'I think she wants me to pick a different New Year's Resolution for 2015, sometimes hunting for photographs can become quite tiresome for others. 

'But there's also one from when I was best man for my mate Ben Harvey. We have known each other all our lives, our parents are best friends and so are we.

'That was a special day and it's nice to have got a photo with the happy couple. At times I have felt a little strange constantly taking photographs.

'I must have looked crazy to others, but I have a priceless memento of this year that I will never lose.'

Matt's girlfriend hopes he doesn't repeat the challenge in 2015 as she is tired of his taking photos of himself
