The University of Michigan has spent a whopping $16,000 on a campaign telling students to watch what they say to avoid hurting other students' feelings.

On posters and pamphlets plastered across its campus in Ann Arbor, the public college advises its 43,000 students to avoid words including 'I want to die', 'crazy', 'gay' and 'ghetto'.

The notices are part of the university's 'Inclusive Language Campaign', which hopes to 'improve the day-to-day language of students on campus by providing education around words that are offensive', student campaign representative Kidada Malloy told The College Fix.

'Offensive': The University of Michigan has launched a campaign to educate students on words that others could find offensive, such as 'tranny' and 'retarded'. Pictured: A pamphlet explaining some of the words

Concerning events held on campus last year indicated the need for such material, Amanda McLittle, coordinator of Diversity Education in University Housing, told the Michigan Daily.

Theta Xi held a 'Hood Ratchet' party last year, sparking the hashtag '#BBUM', which stood for 'Being Black at Michigan', where African American students shared their experiences online. 

'We don't talk enough about how our language and the words that we use, and how they impact others,' McLittle told the paper. 'Last year's events showed that this has always been needed.' 

'YOUR WORDS MATTER' the posters read. They ask questions including: 'If you knew that I grew up in poverty, would you still call things 'ghetto' and 'ratchet'?'

In the pamphlets, the group lists offensive words and explains why they might be hurtful. 

For example, they warn students against using 'I want to die' because the words 'carelessly diminish the experience of people who have attempted or committed suicide'.

The phrase 'that's retarded' 'perpetuates able-ism by implying that individuals with mental, emotional, or physical disabilities are abnormal, defective, or inferior', another section reads. 

The university's 'Inclusive Language Campaign' warns students that the following words may offend others:

 

'crazy'

'insane'

'that's so retarded' 

'that's so gay'

'jewed' 

'tranny'

'gypped'

'ratchet'

'illegal alien'

'fag'

'ghetto'

'raghead'

'I want to die'

'that test raped me'

Students have been involved in the campaign since its beginning and staff members have helped them hold focus groups to figure out the direction of the work.

'This program is intended to be educational, not regulatory,' University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said of the campaign. 'We hope there is only the understanding that we all participate in, and have the power to influence campus culture.'

When asked if the campaign stifled free speech, he added that the opposite is true.

'We believe it will make discourse more constructive by respecting the views and perspectives of others,' he said.

'A campus conversation about the impact of words is good for everyone.'

The campaign was launched last semester and included a series of kick-off events.

The costly campaign comes at a time when the college has raised tuition and fees for the past two years, The College Fix reported.
