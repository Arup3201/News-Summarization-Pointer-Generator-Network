In September, Mr Knights, of Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, from was unable to attend a court case at St Albans Crown Court as he was in hospital for treatment after collapsing.

He had been accused of breaching the 
order banning him from contacting Ms Taylforth except through a 
solictor, but denied doing so.

The court was told that he had undergone surgery to have a tumour removed from his stomach.

The couple's troubled relationship hit headlines in the past with Knights allegedly receiving a non-molestation order from a judge in 2009

The couple's troubled relationship made headlines across the UK for years.

In 1992 Ms Taylforth tried to sue a newspaper which accused her of performing a sex act on Mr Knights in their Range Rover.

She had accused him of cheating on her in 2005, but later forgave him.

The following year Mr Knights was arrested after attacking Taylforth in a restaurant, and was later released with a caution after she refused to press charges. 

Mr Knights received a non-molestation order from a judge following his split from the actress in 2009.

Speaking in 2010, Ms Taylforth had said that it had been a difficult decision to split with Mr Knights.

'You don’t just turn off your feelings after 23 years, but I know I made the right decision for me,' she told Closer magazine.

Ms Taylforth rose to fame as Kathy Beale in 1985, a role in which she stayed until 2000.
