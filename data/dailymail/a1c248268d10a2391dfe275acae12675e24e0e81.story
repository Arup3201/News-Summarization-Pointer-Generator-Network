Presumed drowned: The nine-year-old girl, called Auna, from Mississippi who cannot swim was caught out as she was playing behind her house when she was washed away by rushing floodwater

A 9-year-old girl in Mississippi is missing and feared dead after she was swept away in a flash flood brought on by storms that dropped nearly seven inches of rain over the last two days in the Southeast.Â 

The girl's mother reported that floodwater pulled her daughter into a channel under a road around 8pm CT in Yazoo City, which received four to five inches of rain within a short period of time.

Rescuers searched the area and several other rain-swollen drainage ditches but found no sign of her.

The little girl who cannot swim, is 
known as Auna. She was playing in the backyard when she was swept under 
and into a culvert behind her home. It's believed she drowned in the 
torrent of water.

Search teams, including divers are now focusing on a canal and creeks that that culvert feeds into.

Throughout Monday morning, officials had searched the culvert, and the surrounding area.

One canal runs at least four or five miles before draining into the Yazoo River.

Deluge: Some roads in Birmingham became impassable due to heavy rainfall. Parts of central Alabama were under a flash flood warning on Monday as heavy rain continued to pelt the state's midsection

The
 storms hit Mississippi on Sunday and spread overnight into Alabama and 
Georgia. Strong winds downed trees, power lines and snarled rush hour 
commutes.

Heavy rain caused flash flooding in 
central Alabama, where crews in small boats and military trucks had to 
rescue more than two dozen people from their homes and cars.

A possible tornado damaged homes and hurt seven people in another part of the state.

In
 Pelham, just south of Birmingham, more than 4 inches of rain fell from 7
 p.m. Sunday to 7 a.m. Monday. Police and firefighters rescued people 
who became trapped in townhomes and a mobile home park that flooded 
because of a nearby swollen creek.

Dozens of cars had water up to their roofs as rescue workers wearing life jackets waded through to reach stranded residents.

Hundreds of more people in mobile homes on higher ground were isolated because water covered the only entrance to the complex. Street signs stuck out of the high water.

At an apartment complex in the suburb of Homewood, rescue crews used a boat to help several residents and pets get out of flooded first-floor units.

At a stairway tread company in Pelham, about a foot of water overflowing from Buck Creek filled the inside of the small factory and swept across the American Safety Tread parking lot. Worker Terry Browning said about 50 people would normally be working.

'They are getting all the power cut off, and then we'll all go home, I guess,' he said.

Some roads in Birmingham became impassable, and schools delayed opening in many areas of central Alabama due to the heavy rains.

In Augusta, Ga., where the Master's golf tournament is being held this week, practice round play was temporarily suspended Monday because of severe weather.

Alabama Power Co., the state's largest electric utility, reported 11,000 homes and businesses without power, with 6,200 in the Birmingham area.

Further south, a possible tornado 
damaged homes in Covington County, where seven minor injuries were 
reported, the Emergency Management Agency said. Wind damage was reported
 elsewhere.

In metro 
Atlanta, heavy rains slowed cars on the interstates and traffic lights 
were knocked out. Rain was expected to continue for much of Monday and 
flood warnings were in effect across the region.

The National Weather Service also warned people that more tornadoes and severe thunderstorms were possible.

Closed: Augusta National Golf Club closed due to the weather and Monday's practice round has been canceled. Thunderstorms are expected to remain in the area throughout the afternoon
