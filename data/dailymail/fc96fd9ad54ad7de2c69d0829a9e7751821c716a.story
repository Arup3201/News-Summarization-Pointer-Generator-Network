Radio DJ Neil 'Dr' Fox has been re-arrested on suspicion of three  sexual assaults.

It comes two months after the former Pop Idol judge was first arrested at the Magic FM offices in London following four earlier allegations of sexual assault against two women.

The 53-year-old presenter, known as Doctor Fox, was questioned today over a further three alleged sexual assaults involving different women after he returned to a London police station on bail. 

Radio DJ Neil 'Dr' Fox, who is facing four sexual assault allegations, has been arrested on suspicion of three further sexual assaults. The 53-year-old was questioned at a central London police station today 

He said he 'strenuously' denied the allegations after he was questioned by officers. 

Speaking to ITV News, Fox said: '(I'm) obviously extremely upset about these allegations. (I) strenuously deny these allegations.

'(I've been) with my legal team this afternoon trying to answer the police questions as best we possibly can, of course, and helping them as much as we can.

'Apart from that it is probably inappropriate that I say anything else at the moment.'

Two of the latest allegations, which involve different women, are said have happened in the 1990s, and the third is said to have happened in 2007. He has been bailed to a date in March 2015.

Mr Fox was first arrested on Tuesday, September 30, following four allegations of sexual assault against two women, including three 'non-recent' allegations and one from earlier this year.

Mr Fox was first held by detectives on September 30 at the Magic FM offices in London just moments after coming off-air. A spokesman for Bauer Media, which owns Magic FM, did not comment on his latest arrest

He was questioned for more than seven hours over four alleged offences relating to two women. Three of the earlier claims are historic and the fourth relates to an incident earlier this year. 

Officers subsequently searched addresses in Fulham, west London and in the area of Littlehampton, West Sussex. 

A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police did not name the broadcaster, but confirmed that a 53-year-old man had been arrested today for a further three alleged sexual assaults involving three different women. 

A spokesman for Bauer Media, which owns Magic FM, said: 'We have no comment to make on what is a police matter.' 

Fox (far right) is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. He has also presented a Channel 5 show based on the Top 40 Chart

Following Fox's arrest in September, the company said the presenter would be off air 'to enable him to devote his full attention to dealing with these matters'.

A spokeswoman for Fox declined to comment. 

Mr Fox, who is known by nicknames 'Doctor Fox' and 'Foxy, started his career in local radio before moving the Radio Luxembourg and later Capital FM. 

There he presented in a number of slots, rising to fame as a DJ in the early 1990s. In 1993 he was given the job of hosting the Pepsi Network Chart on Sunday afternoon.

The Top 40 show soared in popularity and at one time had a bigger audience than its Radio 1 rival.

He was later rumoured to have been offered the coveted breakfast slot on Radio 1, following the departure of Chris Evans.

Earlier this month Neil Fox hosted Magic FM's London's Biggest Breakfast which was attended by Mayor Boris Johnson, who hosted a breakfast club at the event. He joined the commercial radio station in 2005

Fox went on to present a Channel 5 TV show based around the Pepsi Top 40 Chart and has won numerous awards throughout his career.

But he is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol, a forerunner of X Factor, alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman.

The series ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003 and set the format of TV talent shows based on audience voting for the next decade.

Two years later Fox took the breakfast show chair on 105.4 Magic FM and has remained there ever since. 

A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'On Tuesday, 30 September, officers from Westminster arrested a 53-year-old man following four allegations of sexual assault against two women.

‘Three of the allegations are non-recent, one is from earlier this year.

‘The man was arrested at a business address and taken to a central London police station.

‘On Monday, 8 December, he returned on bail to a central London police station and was arrested for a further three sexual assaults involving different women.

‘The man has now been bailed to return pending further enquiries to a date in March 2015.’
