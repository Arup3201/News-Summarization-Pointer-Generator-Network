Adrift in the vast Pacific Ocean for four weeks, two fishermen began to drink sea water when the rains stopped and their small supply of fresh water ran out.

The salt water would have killed them from severe dehydration within three days - but just as all hope was running out the desperate men were seen by a US fishing boat.

As 40-year-old Elirito Tataua and Teikauea Tegiaa, 20, recovered from their ordeal on board the Pacific Princess today, the ship's captain, Alfred Canepa, told how he found the men by chance.

'They had drifted 420 miles from Bahaba Island, in Kiribati's Gilbert Islands, where they'd been fishing,' said Captain Canepa.

'They were surviving on raw fish and rain water, but when the rains stopped and there was no fresh water they were in a lot of trouble.

'They were extremely weak and malnourished, but, surprisingly, they are in a lot better shape than I would have been, put it that way - it's a hell of an ordeal, believe me.'

Captain Canepa told Radio Australia that he was lucky to find the men.

'We were searching for fish and 16 miles away on my bird radar I spotted a small flock of birds.

'As fish attract birds, I went to go and check it out and luckily I did turn that way to check because we found this small boat with two men adrift at sea, lost. We found them in the nick of time.'

The pair were fishing off the coast of the Gilbert Islands in Kiribati when their engine broke down and they drifted 420 miles west towards the Solomon Islands before they could be saved and taken to American Samoa

Captain Canepa said the men were on a 14ft boat when the engine broke down and strong winds began pushing them towards the Solomon Islands.

'Once they were taken on board I gave them water straight away, just small amounts at a time.

'It was a dry spell and they weren't getting much rain and what happened was they started drinking salt water - and that's lethal.

'They wouldn't have last another three days doing that.'

After rehydrating themselves the men spent an hour in a small chapel on the Pacific Princess giving thanks for their rescue.

The men's board was hauled onto the Pacific Princess, which is based at American Samoa,  and Captain Canepda promised them that he and his crew would repair the engine and return it to their island home when his vessel passes by that way.

The plan was to take the men to the Solomon Islands where arrangements would be made to return them to Kiribati.

'They've spoken to their families and it's turned out to be a very happy ending,' said Captain Canepa.
