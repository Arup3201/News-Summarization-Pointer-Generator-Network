Critical: Johnson said well-off Britons should give their wealth to charity rather than passing large homes on to their children

Boris Johnson yesterday criticised well-off Britons who buy large houses to pass on to their children instead of giving their wealth to charity.

He said the country needed to adopt a culture of philanthropy like that of the US, where there is a ‘culture of giving and being recognised as givers’.

Despite owning a large house in Henley, Oxfordshire, and a £2.3million home in a fashionable part of North London, the father-of-five criticised those who ‘desperately’ aimed to amass property wealth to pass on to their offspring ‘for some unknown reason’.

The former Conservative MP earns £143,911 as London Mayor, and four years ago described the £250,000 he is paid for writing a column in a national newspaper as ‘chicken feed’. He has also written several books, from which he earns an income.

Critics last night claimed his comments were hypocritical, given the Eton-educated mayor’s privileged upbringing.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk said: ‘I’m sure lots of people who’ve worked hard and want to pass on something to their children will not take kindly to being lectured by an over-privileged politician like Boris who’s been living pretty high on the hog his whole life.

The way to encourage philanthropy is certainly not by going around insulting people. Boris really should know better.’

Mr Johnson was speaking in London alongside philanthropic New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who was launching a competition to offer £4.2million to any European city that comes up with innovative ideas to solve urban problems.

Asked what he believed the barriers were to philanthropy in Britain, Mr Johnson said wealthy Britons just wanted to buy the largest ‘schloss’ – a castle or manor house – they could, adding: ‘It’s a cultural thing.

The trouble with the people in this country is – and I’ll get myself in terrible trouble here – is that what they really want to do when they’ve amassed colossal wealth in Britain, is buy the biggest possible house they can with the most colossal grouse moorland they can find and then try in some desperate way to perpetuate it and to pass it on to their children, for some unknown reason.

Nice place: One of two properties owned by Boris Johnson - a north London town house

‘In America they have a very different attitude in that they believe that if you have made a lot of money you should do something for society.

‘There’s still something in Britain which regards giving on a huge scale as somehow ostentatious – that is absolutely ridiculous.

‘The sooner people get over their lust to buy great schlosses in the home counties – or indeed grouse moors – and give to great causes in London, the better.’

The three-times New York mayor Mr Bloomberg, who is a multi-billionaire media mogul, has given much of his wealth to good causes.

He said: ‘Some places in Europe look down on private philanthropy, arguing it takes away the responsibility of the Government.

‘That’s misguided because the government should do conventional things with the public’s money, but society needs innovation and risk-takers and that’s where private philanthropy fits in.’
