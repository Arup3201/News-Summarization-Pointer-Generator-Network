Worms could be used to fight a range of debilitating autoimmune diseases, research has revealed.

A molecule in parasitic worms may be used to fight illnesses including multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

Scientists identified peptides - naturally occurring biological molecules - from the creatures that suppress a body’s immune response, and they believe it could pave the way for a new drug to provide relief from the often painful symptoms of such diseases.

There are hopes that a molecule in parasitic worms could fight autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

Scientists have identified a peptide from the worms to suppress the body’s immune response.

Called AcK1, the peptide dampens the immune system by inhibiting a potassium channel (Kv1.3).

They discovered that AcK1 closely resembles ShK, a peptide from a sea anemone, which has been shown to suppress autoimmune diseases and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

AcK1 could be an ingredient in a future ‘worm pill’.

The pill could one day be used an alternative to helminthic therapy, which involves people deliberately infecting themselves with parasitic worms in a bid to force their autoimmune disease into remission.

Rare autoimmune diseases affect over 100,000 people in the UK, with many more suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, for example.

They occur when a person’s immune system has an abnormal response against its own cells, tissues or even entire organs, resulting in inflammation and damage.

Scientists are unsure exactly what causes the body to turn in on itself, but diagnoses are rocketing in the West.

‘There are more than 80 autoimmune diseases, ranging in severity from mild to life threatening in some cases, and while some affect mainly one area or organ, others can affect many parts of the body,’ said Professor Ray Norton from Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mips) in Australia.

‘Many people believe there’s a link between the rise in autoimmune diseases and an increased focus on cleanliness in Western societies, because the immune system is no longer exposed to the broad range of infections that previous generations had to deal with.

‘There could be some truth to this because worm infection is virtually unheard of in developed countries, yet the incidence of autoimmune diseases is high. But in developing countries the opposite is true.’

A ‘worm pill’ could one day be used an alternative to helminthic therapy, which involves people deliberately infecting themselves with parasitic worms in a bid to force their autoimmune disease into remission.

The study, published in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (Faseb) Journal, said that some experts think the worms have a calming effect on their host's immune systems in order to ensure their survival.

A ‘worm pill’ may be off putting to some people, so the researchers have isolated the active components responsible for immunomodulatory effects - the treatment of disease by inducing, enhancing, or suppressing an immune response - in parasitic worms.

They created a DNA library from the secretory glands of the Ancylostoma caninium parasitic hookworm.

They discovered that AcK1 closely resembles ShK, a peptide from a sea anemone, which has been shown to suppress autoimmune diseases and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

Dr Sandeep Chhabra from the university, said the study will help in developing new drugs to treat autoimmune diseases.

‘Our research shows that it is possible to identify individual molecules responsible for this beneficial effect,’ he said.

‘The next step will be to see if we can develop this into a pill that could dampen the immune system in people with an autoimmune disease. That’s a whole lot cleaner than putting a worm in your body.’
