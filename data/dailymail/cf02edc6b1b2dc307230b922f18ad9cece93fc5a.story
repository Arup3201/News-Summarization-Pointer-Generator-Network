Jose Mourinho has revealed he will give Chelsea's youngsters a chance in the first-team when the time is right.

The Blues won the FA Youth Cup for a third time in five years after beating Fulham 7-6 over two legs earlier this month but many of the club's youngsters have failed to go on and make it in the Chelsea first-team.

Asked when members of Chelsea's successful youth side would be given a chance in the first team, Mourinho, taking part in a Twitter Q&A session with Yahoo Sports, responded: 'I want it in the right time. I don't want them to come and not to succeed.'

Answers: Mourinho answered a varied array of questions from fans across the globe

With a host of talented youngsters at his disposal, the Chelsea boss also revealed his perfect signing would be a player with potential who he could later sell-on for a big transfer fee.

Perhaps with an eye on Financial Fair Play, when asked who he would choose to sign if he could buy shares in any player, Mourinho said: 'I would buy cheap shares so go to cheap markets where I could find big potential and years later make money.'

Meanwhile, the Chelsea manager has admitted he would love to stay at Stamford Bridge for at least the next decade.

However, with many Premier League clubs accused of sacking managers too quickly, the 'Special One' accepts it may not be possible to remain in the hotseat for such a long period of time. Chelsea themselves have had eight managers since Mourinho's first spell came to an end in 2007.

Asked where he sees himself in 10 years time, the former Porto, Inter Milan and Real Madrid boss said: 'Still coaching a big team, I would love to say Chelsea but I understand modern football. 10 years is a long time.'

With the season over after Chelsea failed to claim a trophy during Mourinho's return to west London, the 51-year-old is already working ahead of the next campaign and will continue to do so, even on holiday.

Revealing he will work to the end of June, Mourinho said: 'From then to mid-July I enjoy holidays but know that the phone and pad are with me.'

While Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa is expected to join for the Blues this summer, Mourinho delved into Chelsea history for another transfer when one fan asked: 'If you could sign any player past or present, dead or alive, who would it be?'

Mourinho replied: 'For Chelsea, I go for Peter Osgood. He is important part of Chelsea history.'

The Blues legend, who sadly passed away in 2006, scored over 100 goals for the club during two spells in the 60s and 70s.
