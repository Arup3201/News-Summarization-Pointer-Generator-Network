After the Golden Generation comes England’s new Jilted Generation. Disowned by the paying public at Wembley on Wednesday night and increasingly unwanted by the biggest clubs in the transfer market.

Almost 40,000 are expected at Wembley, itself something of a triumph for the marketing department considering England’s uninspiring performances in Brazil.

Roy Hodgson claimed ticket sales may have been hit by the start of the school year but, in fairness, this seemed unlikely. 

Tough job: Roy Hodgson must try to excite the English public again against Norway on Wednesday night

Lack of interest: Around 40,000 fans, less than half the capacity, are expected to be in attendance

Tough to watch: England were knocked out of the World Cup without winning a game in Brazil

It’s hard to imagine the armchair audience voting in their millions by snubbing The Great British Bake Off for a friendly against Norway, in preparation for a Euro 2016 qualifying campaign so simple that England cannot fail to make it to the finals in France.

The general lack of interest is a direct result of finishing on the soggy bottom of a World Cup group won by Costa Rica, and the feeling of apathy is more dangerous for the Football Association than one of anger which has taken hold in the past, when the nation expected more of its team.

Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole have gone, taking with them 300-plus caps of experience and the last vestiges of a seam of talent so rich it forced England to believe and then blush with embarrassment when they did not deliver.

Meanwhile, those chosen to represent the future have problems of their own, such as how to get a game in the Champions League.

The bulk of the £800million spent by Barclays Premier League clubs went on foreign players and while Hodgson complains about ‘blocked pathways’ he knows there is little he can do to reverse the trend other than offer a few words of encouragement to the young players who will form the basis of his rebuilding operation.

‘I’m loath to talk about eras,’ he said. ‘It’s more a question of keeping things moving forward.’

But this represents ground zero as he starts the process of engaging a nation of 50 million and rewarding those loyal fans who stood to applaud a goalless draw against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte. 

He can barely afford another backward step. Monday’s Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland is the toughest game of the campaign and he cannot surrender the initiative by losing the opening fixture. 

Not just a friendly: Hodgson can barely afford a backwards step as he looks to engage a nation

Big chance: Wayne Rooney captains the side on Wednesday night and will hope to lead them to Euro 2016

In form: Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling have been in fine form for Liverpool so far this season

Hodgson said all the things you might expect to lift the mood, as did his new skipper Wayne Rooney, even though Manchester United’s swoop for Radamel Falcao raises questions about his future role in Louis van Gaal’s team.

If it was down to former England and United defender Paul Parker, he would be the next forced to the fringes once occupied by Daniel Welbeck and now featuring Tom Cleverley.

‘It’s the cleft-stick situation,’ said Hodgson, as he explained why good English players are wanted at the big clubs, but might not be good enough to play every week. James Milner finds himself in this cleft at Manchester City. Jack Rodwell has escaped it. Joe Hart seems to exist one bad patch of form away from it.

‘I certainly feel I’m capable of dropping back and I’m sure one day I will,’ said Rooney when asked if he might become a midfielder, but for now the United striker will lead England from the front, in every sense.

‘I’ve always said I don’t want to finish my career with England having not won anything,’ said Rooney. ‘I’ve always wanted to win a trophy with England, and if I can lead us to do that, that’ll be the pinnacle of my career.

‘That will be very difficult, but I really do think it’s achievable. Look at the players we’ve got. They’re exciting players. They have to do what they do for their clubs with England, and we have to bring that together. That has to be our aim.’ 

Trophy hunter: Rooney insists he is still eager to win a trophy with England... perhaps as a midfielder

United group: Rooney has promised to be 'vocal' and 'demanding' as captain of the Three Lions

As a captain, he promised to be ‘vocal’ and ‘demanding’. ‘I’m harsh on myself and harsh on my team-mates,’ he added, and did not seem bothered to hear Norway’s Vegard Forren had called him ‘chubby’.

‘To be honest, I’m not too interested,’ shrugged Rooney, who will win his 96th cap, before Hodgson noted: ‘Wayne’s in fantastic physical condition.’

Elsewhere there are good English players defying the system, of course. There is perhaps no more exciting talent in the Premier League than Raheem Sterling, who will start against Norway as Hodgson goes for energy and pace on the flanks in something of a return to his beloved 4-4-2 formation.

‘I don’t need to get hung up as to whether it’s the buzz formation of the moment,’ said Hodgson. ‘We don’t intend to go down the road of three at the back at the moment, because we have players perfectly suited to playing in a four.’ 

Now's your chance: Hodgson admitted it was time for Jack Wilshere to step up as an England midfielder

Up front, he will hope Rooney and Daniel Sturridge gel more successfully than they have to date, while in central defence he will explore a partnership of Phil Jones and Gary Cahill.

One of them, probably Cahill, the second most capped outfield player in this side, must start to command at the back, but it is in central midfield where Hodgson will be desperate for signs of encouragement from Jack Wilshere and Jordan Henderson.

Without Gerrard and Lampard, the dearth of options is underlined by the fact the next cabs in the rank are Jack Colback and Fabian Delph.

‘Most people have been thinking this could be the chance for Jack Wilshere,’ said Hodgson. ‘I believe that too. This is his chance. I hope he and Jordan can do well together. It’s important for them to develop a relationship.’
