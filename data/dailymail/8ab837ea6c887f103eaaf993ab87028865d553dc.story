Victoria Police have been criticised for a 'blaming the victim' mentality and bad timing after posting a warning about taking extra safety measures in parks late at night, in the wake of the brutal murder of teenager Masa Vukotic.

Sean Price, has been charged with stabbing Vukotic to death in a park in Melbourne on Tuesday evening.

Police homicide chief Michael Hughes told ABC radio on Friday: ‘I suggest to people, particularly females, they shouldn’t be alone in parks.

‘I’m sorry to say that is the case. We just need to be a little bit more careful a little bit more security conscious.’

The service posted on its Facebook advice to people to try to stay safe that included warnings to stay in well-lit areas if travelling through parks 'late at night.'

Victoria's Minister for Women and the Prevention of Family Violence, Fiona Richardson, led the criticism of Hughe's comments.

She said he 'undoubtedly has the best interest of women in mind and made comments on radio this morning out of care and concern for women, who are all too often victims of crime.'

'However, hearing a senior police officer say that, as a woman you are not safe going about your leisure activities or daily business, is a sad indictment on our society.

'The community conversation needs to be about stopping men from committing these terrible crimes in the first place, not just about women need to protect themselves.'

Community members were quick to point out that Masa was killed at 7pm on Tuesday evening.

Meanwhile, devastated friends of Vukotic, who was stabbed to death while exercising in a park, have vowed to wear pink in her honour.

Friends of murdered schoolgirl Vukotic have paid tribute to their 'beautiful Princess Marci' on Facebook and organised a picnic memorial in a park for the ‘beautiful, loving, sweet, smart, charismatic and hilarious young woman with a bright future ahead of her’.

On Thursday, as 31-year-old man Sean Price was charged with Masa's brutal murder, Victoria Police homicide chief Michael Hughes told ABC radio: ‘I suggest to people, particularly females, they shouldn’t be alone in parks.

‘I’m sorry to say that is the case. We just need to be a little bit more careful a little bit more security conscious.’

‘The safety of all members of our community is a priority to Victoria Police. We ask that everyone, male or female, take a common sense approach to their safety,’ the police Facebook post said.

‘If you’re walking through a park late at night, stay close to well lit areas or walk with friends where possible. Don’t shut yourself off to the world, keep one ear free when listening to music and keep your valuables secure. We simply ask that everyone stay alert and stay safe.’

Facebook user Pete Bannan replied: ‘It's purely sad that people innocently walking need to be reminded of this.’

Angel Egginton said: ‘This is all well and good but someone was attacked in Doncaster in broad daylight... It doesn't matter anymore we aren’t safe anywhere.’

Carla Regan responded: ‘I have a 6 year old daughter and it scares the hell out of me that one day I will have to let her take on this world alone. This poor girl was going about her daily exercise and was murdered in cold blood, it makes me cry.’

Victoria Police posted a warning on their Facebook page which asked people to try and not be alone in a park at night

'Everyone who met you loved you marci, you're gone but will never be forgotten,' one of her friends wrote on Facebook

Masa Vukotic, 17, was murdered about 7pm on Tuesday while she was walking on a footpath near her Doncaster home - in Melbourne's east. Pink flowers and a pink rabbit were left at the scene

Erin Manderson said: ‘I understand the common sense safety message, but the timing of this message is wrong. It validates the victim blaming mentality that so many people already have. Thousands of people walk or run day and night with earphones in and should be able to continue to do so without fearing that the person jogging behind them is going to stab them. Awful. Love and strength to her family and friends.’

And Jade Eastwood blasted: ‘I'm sorry but I hardly consider 7pm late at night!’

Ms Vukotic was murdered just five minutes from her Doncaster home in Melbourne's east on Tuesday.

Ms Vukotic, known affectionately by her friends as 'Marci', was stabbed in daylight while walking along a path at Koonung Creek Linear Reserve just before 7pm in what police believe was a 'random attack'.

On Thursday, Melbourne man Sean Price, 31, was charged with her murder. Police allege he went on a rampage of rape, assault and an attempted car-jacking in the hours after he is accused of killing the 17-year-old and before he handed himself into police.

In a Facebook event post for the memorial tribute, Ms Vukotic's friends wrote: ‘On the 28th of this month, we will be holding a memorial for our dear friend. Please, invite your friends to come. No alcohol or drugs are permitted as this is strictly a memorial event. Marci needs to be remembered - her name needs to be known. She was an amazing influence on so many lives.’

The memorial picnic will be held at Queen Victoria Gardens and will be called 'Princess Marci's Royal Picnic'.

Her friends are asking people to wear pink or 'Lolita Japapese fashion' as an ode to Masa's style, or something 'rabbit-related' as she was so fond of her pet rabbit, Roger. 

'The world has certainly become a darker place without her,' a friend told Daily Mail Australia.

On Wednesday night more than 100 mourners visited the crime scene, with her friends dressing in pink to lay flowers where her body was found.

'Marci was without a doubt one of the most wonderful people I've ever met,' a friend said.

Using the hashtag #pinkformarci her friends drew these touching tributes of Princess Marci. One friend wrote: 'I had no pink clothes to wear in her honour so here's a pretty pink piece for the friend we lost'

One of her talented friends drew her as an angel with the caption 'rest in peace, Princess' 

'She was so full of personality and passion and her sense of humour was incredible.'

'She inspired myself and so many others to love ourselves and be confident in who we are. She never missed a moment to remind her friends that she thought they were wonderful.'

Friends spoke fondly of her love of the colour pink, her pet rabbit Roger, dressing up and Japanese fashion.

Masa, who only just turned 17 in December, was one of three children from a Serbian family who had moved to Melbourne from Montenegro.

Her distressed relatives were pictured arriving at the park following news of her death.

Her body was found by police along a walking track when a neighbour called triple zero after hearing screams and saw a man fleeing the scene.

She was in cardiac arrest when she was found, but paramedics were unable to save her and she died at the scene.

Police say she was wearing headphones at the time and may not have heard the attacker approaching.

Ms Vukotic has been described as a bright girl who knew three languages and was focussed on her dream of becoming a lawyer.

'It's such a shame she'll never reach those dreams now,' a friend said.

'She never let anything or anyone stand in her way. She was passionate and driven and I love her very much.'

'She was an absolutely gorgeous girl and without fail would always make me laugh or smile,' said a friend.

'I can only wish her self-confidence and will to learn inspires others and her memories live on for the years to come.'

The friends shared photos of Ms Vukotic with a bright smile on her face as she dressed up for 'Cosplay', where people dress up as fictional characters for conventions.

Ms Vukotic has been remembered as a 'loving, sweet, smart' young woman with a zest for life and a bright future
