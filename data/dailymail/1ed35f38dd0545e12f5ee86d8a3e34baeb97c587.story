The parents of Joanna Yeates spoke of their regret that her killer could not be hanged yesterday after he was found guilty of murder.

And they expressed the hope that Vincent Tabak would spend the rest of his days in ‘a living hell’.

David and Teresa Yeates spoke out after it emerged that 33-year-old Tabak was a dangerous pervert who was sexually aroused by pornography depicting violence towards women. He regularly trawled the internet for films which showed girls being strangled.

Yet evidence of his sick fixation was not put before the jury who rejected his plea of guilty to manslaughter, and nor were they told that he paid prostitutes for sex when he was on trips away from his live-in girlfriend.

His victim’s parents wept at their home after learning that their daughter’s murderer had been jailed for a minimum of 20 years for the ‘dreadful, evil act’ he committed on December 17 last year.

For the first time in the three-week trial neither Mr Yeates, 64, nor his 59-year-old wife had attended Bristol Crown Court as the jury considered their verdict for a third day.

Afterwards they said they regretted that capital punishment was not an option for the judge, and they hoped the rest of Tabak’s life ‘is a living hell, being the recipient of all the evils, deprivations and degradations that his situation can provide’.

They said: ‘We have lost our daughter, and our son has lost his sister.

‘Our main sorrow is that Jo was not allowed to start her own family, have children and achieve her potential.

'We will never get over our loss, how she was murdered, and the total lack of respect with which her body was treated. We so miss hearing her happy voice and seeing her living life to the full.’

After meticulously researching the legal difference between murder and manslaughter, Tabak claimed he never intended to kill the 25-year-old landscape architect before bundling her body in the boot of his car, driving to Asda to do some shopping, then dumping the corpse by the side of a country road where it lay under snow undiscovered until Christmas morning.

Jo’s parents David and Teresa Yeates, issued this statement yesterday.

We attended the trial of Jo’s murderer not to see justice handed out to him, but to learn what we couldabout what really happened from the time when Jo disappeared to when Jo’s murderer was arrested.

The last four weeks have been more stressful and intense than we ever imagined. Although we had been made aware of the nature of much of the evidence against Jo’s killer, some of the details which came out were a surprise.

There was never any doubt in our minds that Jo had been murdered and that we fully expected him to lie when he went into the witness box.

We came here with little hope or expectation of hearing what happened on the 17th of December, but needed to see him and to hear what he had to sayfirst hand.

We saw no emotion or remorse or regret for what he did to Jo. We felt that all emotions expressed by him were false. All we heard were words of selfpity.

Thus, it is with regret that capital punishment is not a possible option for his sentence. The best we can hope for him is that he spends the rest of his life incarcerated, where his life is a living hell, being the recipient of all evils, deprivations and degradations that his situation can provide.

During the fatal attack he inflicted 43 injuries on his next-door neighbour, who was alone in her flat in Clifton, Bristol while her boyfriend Greg Reardon was away visiting family.

Despite admitting squeezing her throat for 20 seconds he insisted he had meant only to stifle the screams heard by several witnesses outside, a claim rejected by the jury yesterday.

He then moved her body into his car and drove to Asda, where he sent a text to his girlfriend to say he was ‘bored’ – and to create an alibi that he had been away from the flat.

Carefully following the investigation into Miss Yeates’s disappearance, he looked at pornography after viewing websites featuring her image.

Mr Justice Field told the murderer: 
‘When you entered her flat you did not even know her name and had 
virtually nothing to do with her.

‘You
proceeded to strangle her, intending to kill her, a dreadful, evil act 
committed against a vulnerable unsuspecting young woman in her own home.

‘That wicked act ended the life of a young woman who was entitled to expect a life of happiness and fulfilment.

‘In my judgment you are very dangerous and also thoroughly deceitful, dishonest and manipulative.

‘You
have caused devastation, heartache and distress to Joanna’s family and 
her partner Greg Reardon, not only by taking Joanna’s life but also by 
hiding her body with the result that they had to go through seven days 
of anguish, wondering what happened to her.’

The judge added: ‘On your 
own evidence and after an acquaintanceship lasting just a few minutes 
you moved to kiss Joanna, and I’m quite sure you did not intend to stop 
there and wanted to go much further.

‘It was because of her screams that your sexual purpose was frustrated.

‘You killed Joanna when she was alone in her own home where she was entitled to think she was safe and secure.

‘Joanna died a dreadful death at your hands. She died in pain, beset with fear, struggling desperately for her life. You went to Asda as cool as may be with her body in the boot of your car before hiding it under leaves in a country lane hoping it would decompose before it was discovered.

‘You attempted to divert attention away from yourself and cynically implicated your landlord, Christopher Jefferies in her murder.’

Tabak, in dark suit, white shirt and blue tie, stood with his hands clasped, closed his eyes and bowed as the verdict was announced by the jury who had deliberated for 13 hours and 56 minutes before announcing their 10-2 majority verdict.

Tabak, an architectural engineer, could now face further criminal charges after it emerged that police were examining suspicious material on his computer hard drives.

His girlfriend at the time of the murder, Tanja Morson, did not give evidence. Her father Geoffrey, who lives in Cambridge, said after the verdict: ‘Our immediate thoughts, as always, go out to the Yeates family. Our priority is that we have a daughter still.’

Ann Reddrop, head of the Complex Case Unit, said Tabak had used the internet to keep ‘one step ahead of the investigation prior to his arrest’ and then sought to cast Miss Yeates in an unfavourable light when giving evidence to the jury.

Outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Phil Jones said Tabak would be behind bars for a long time but Joanna’s parents ‘still have to face each Christmas with the memory of a daughter taken from them’.
