Suffolk MP Tim Yeo, 69, claimed £1,319 for two computers and monitors

A group of MPs used their parliamentary expenses to go on a computer-buying spree – just a few months before they stand down at this year’s General Election, it was revealed last night.

Six MPs bought more than £6,000 worth of equipment between them, shortly before they would have been banned from doing so under House of Commons rules. 

MPs are forbidden from using public funds to buy expensive new equipment when a General Election is less than six months away.

MPs are asked to pass on IT equipment to their successors or a charity when they leave the Commons, but that is only ‘guidance’. They can keep it if they prefer.

The MPs, who have already announced they are leaving the Commons, charged a total of £6,300 for computers, iPads and other equipment. 

They all filed the claims before the cut-off date of September 30 last year – six months before the end of the final Commons session ahead of this year’s May 7 poll.

The group includes wealthy Suffolk MP Tim Yeo, 69, who was deselected by his local party over claims he did not spend enough time in his constituency. He claimed £1,319 for two computers and monitors.

Fellow former Conservative Minister Jonathan Evans, 64, claimed more than £1,500 for two computers, as well as an iPad Air costing £479.

Multi-millionaire former Conservative Energy Minister Charles Hendry, 55, who is giving up his Wealden seat in East Sussex, claimed £1,024 for a Dell ‘Latitude’ computer. Hove Tory MP Mike Weatherley, 57, claimed £849 for a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 tablet and £109 for a Pro 3 keyboard.

Ex Labour Minister and Leeds MP George Mudie, 69, claimed for a £579 computer and £101 for a printer pen.

And former Conservative Minister James Arbuthnot, 62, MP for North-East Hampshire, claimed £594 for an iPad Mini.

All the claims were made in the weeks leading up to September 30 – and all were approved by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority which controls MPs’ expenses.

There is no suggestion the MPs broke any rules – and the MPs deny any impropriety.

Mr Evans said he had bought his computers so his office could function properly right up until the Election. He joined Mr Mudie, Mr Hendry and Mr Weatherley in saying he would give his equipment away after May 7. Mr Arbuthnot declined to comment and Mr Yeo was not available. 

TaxPayers’ Alliance spokesman Andy Sylvester said: ‘It’s hard to shake the suspicion that MPs are claiming as much as they can on their own personal Black Friday before they leave Westminster.’

lRestaurants in the House of Lords lost almost £2 million last year – with taxpayers left to pick up the bill. The public subsidy for Lords catering, which allows peers to enjoy fine dining at knock-down prices, rose by £100,000.
