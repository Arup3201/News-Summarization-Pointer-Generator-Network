With a front measuring just 47 inches wide, 'the Wedge' has certainly earned its name and place in the record books.

The unique house in Millport in the Isle of Cumbrae in Scotland has been dubbed the narrowest in the world for its slim frontage. It has made the Guinness Book of Records and has just gone on the market for £85,000.

And despite its narrow frontage and shape, current owner Peter McBride insists there is enough room - especially as the house gets wider as you go through to the back.

The Wedge (front door pictured centre) has the narrowest frontage of any house in the world and has just gone on the market for £85,000. It is named in the Guinness Book of Records because of its slim frontage 

Mr McBride bought the house in 2001 with his late wife Judy  after the couple were attracted to the property's distinctive shape, likened to a wedge of cheese.

'I heard all about the house when it last went up for sale back in 2000 and was being talked about on the radio,' the retired businessman told MailOnline.

'After we heard about it my wife and I came to have a look and we bought it straight away.' 

The property has been named the Wedge because it gets wider as you go through the house towards the back and is shaped like a wedge of cheese.

It has one bedroom and bathroom as well as a lounge, kitchen area and inner hall. 

Mr McBride said he has decided to sell the property following the death of his wife five years ago.

The Wedge, pictured in 2000 with former owners the Allisons, gets wider towards the back of the house 

He added: 'I think it is just time for me to move away now. 

'The sea is just 30 yards away, so you get beautiful sea views.' 

Mr McBride said he has not been forced to buy special furniture for the Wedge, but has equipped the house with narrower chairs. 

At its widest point towards the rear the house measures 22ft long by 11ft wide.

In an advert for the property the description reads: 'Uninterrupted sea views, would be of interest to a wide spectrum of purchasers early viewing highly recommended.' 

Mr McBride bought the property from George and June Allison in 2001. The house was put on the market for £27,000 but Mr McBride declined to say how much he paid for it.

Mr McBride said the house gets larger as you go to the back because of its wedge shape, giving enough room

The retired businessman praised the sea views from the property while estate agents have advised viewings

When the Allisons bought the property in the 1980s they had no idea that it could make the record books.

It was only drawn to their attention when a friend noticed that another house in the south of England had claimed to be the narrowest in the world. The couple got The Wedge measured and it earned its place in the Guinness Book of Records for the world's narrowest frontage of a house.

The house may hold the place at the moment, but is closely followed by other properties across the globe contending for the 'narrowest' title.

Squeezed into a tower block in Warsaw, Poland, houses measure just under 60 inches wide and go back almost 40ft into the block. 

And in Brighton Iain and Rachel Boyle rent out a house which measures six foot wide and is in the Hollingdean area of the city. They bought the property for £8,000 more than 15 years ago.
