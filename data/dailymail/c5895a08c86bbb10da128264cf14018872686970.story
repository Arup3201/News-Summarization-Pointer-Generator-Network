Attending a high school dance is a rite of passage for every American teenager.

And Utah student Jordan Dyett helped to make the dream come true for two classmates with special needs by organising an extra-special double date for the Sweetheart Ball at Northridge High School.

After Devin Register told her he was sad he hadn't been asked to the dance, Jordan decided she would ask him herself - and also lined up her closest friend as a date for Devin's best pal.

'Devin came to me last week in class and told me he was upset 'cause no one had asked him to sweethearts yet,' she told Fox 13.

'And I wanted to go to sweethearts I just didn't know who to ask. So I thought: "Why don't I ask Devin, and then my best friend Ashley can ask his best friend Conner?"' said Miss Dyett.

Ashley Brusett duly asked Conner Enz, who also has special needs, to the highly-anticipated dance, and said before the event that she was thoroughly looking forward to the double date.

'They're so fun,' she said of classmates Devin and Conner. 'They're always laughing and having a good time, and you don't have to worry about any of the same old high school drama.'

Pre-dance nerves were no problem for Mr Register, who declared: 'This date's gonna be awesome', and added that he was an 'awesome' dancer.

The two couples enjoyed a trip to a bowling alley and dinner before attending the Sweetheart Ball at the school in Layton, Utah.
