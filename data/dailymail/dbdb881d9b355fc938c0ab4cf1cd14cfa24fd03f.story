A California court heard Friday that an educator accused of sexual assault by a former pupil in a phone conversation that was videoed and later uploaded to YouTube had sex with the girl more than 100 times when she was aged between 12 and 14.

The judge refused to dismiss sexual assault charges against Andrea Michelle Cardosa, 40, a former assistant principal who was charged in February with 16 felony counts, including five counts of aggravated assault on a child.

Prosecutors said Cardosa abused the former student Jamie Carillo, who is now 28, from 1997 to 2001, starting when the child was 12 and attending Chemawa Middle School in Riverside.

According to court documents, the relationship began with Cardosa kissing the girl, and progressed until they had their first sexual encounter in the girls locker room at school.

On another occasion, Cardosa drove Carillo to a secluded area and had sex with her in the back of her car, allege prosecutors.

Carillo says that Cardosa once took her to her sister's home to have sex, and when they heard the front door open Cardosa threw the then-13-year-old Carillo into a closet and threw clothes in on top of her. She told her sister she'd stopped by the house to take a shower.

The girl said that between the time she was 12 to 14 years old, she had sex with Cardosa 'over 100 times.'

Another former student came forward after seeing the video and Cardosa was also charged with abusing her.

In the video posted online on January 17, the former student telephones Alhambra High School, where Cardosa was working, and receptionists connect her to a woman who identifies herself as Cardosa.

'You should be so ashamed and so disgusted with yourself,' Carillo says.

'I am. I am,' the woman says. 'I regret it every day. Every day.'

The former student did not detail the alleged abuse in the video.

Documents reveal that the relationship between Carillo and Cardoso continued until the girl was 18 years old.

When Carillo tried to leave Cardoso, reports the Press-Enterprise, she threatened to kill herself, smashed her head repeatedly on a table and refused to let Carillo leave. She then forced Carillo to have sex with her and the girl was only able to leave once Cardoso fell asleep.

The last time the pair saw each other was in 2007, according to court documents. Cardosa visited Carillo after she gave birth to her first child. Cardosa told the younger woman that she 'wanted to get back together' and that she and her newborn son could move in with her.

She also threatened to tell Carillo's family that she was a lesbian, reports the Press-Enterprise.

Cardosa pleaded not guilty at the hearing, where defense attorney Randy Collins argued that the case should be dismissed because police investigated in 1998 when the mother of the Carillo's friend became concerned about Cardosa's relationship with the student.

That means the statute of limitations for charging Cardosa has expired, he argued.

Prosecutors countered in court papers that the girl told police nothing was wrong because Cardosa urged her to lie and therefore the window to file the case remained.

'You canâ€™t force her to say she was a crime victim. Police stopped investigating,' Supervising Deputy District Attorney John Henry said, reports PE.com. 'The statute is triggered when the victim reports she is a victim.'

Riverside Superior Court Judge Helios Hernandez allowed the case to proceed Friday and also rejected a defense motion to reduce Cardosa's $5 million bail.

The next court hearing was set for May 23.
