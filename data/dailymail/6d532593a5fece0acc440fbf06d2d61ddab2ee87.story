Time is ticking for injured cricketer Michael Clarke.

The Australian captain has until February 21 to prove his fitness to selectors for the cricket World Cup - and he's certainly been putting in the hard yards. 

'While you sleep, I train. While you eat, I train. While you party, I train. February 21 is my goal,' he posted on social media this week. 

Clarke, who wakes at 5.15am every day of the week, spends most of his day at the Sydney Cricket Ground undergoing an extensive rehabilitation program for chronic back and hamstring injuries, the Daily Telegraph reports.

The skipper gets to the SCG at 6.15am ready to complete a strict program designed by the Australian side's medical team.

He can meet with physiotherapists, a rehabilitation manager, a doctor and a strength and conditioning coach on any given day.

The 33-year-old completes daily cardio, strength and pilates sessions in the SCG gym and can spend an hour on alternate days running on the SCG's turf.

During his breaks, Clarke eats as much food as he can to fuel the next part of his program.

The Australian captain took to social media this week to share his goal of proving his fitness to selectors

Clarke trains for an hour in the afternoon at the beach to help prevent further injuries before heading back to the SCG for an hour massage, according to the newspaper. 

While he has made it clear it's his goal, if Clarke is unable to prove he is fully fit by February 21, when Australia tackle Bangladesh in Brisbane, then he won't be able to take part in the World Cup tournament.

Clarke was sidelined for the final three Tests against India after tearing his hamstring. It ended his impressive record of never missing a home Test due to injury.

Cricket Australia boss James Sutherland had no qualms about the hardline stance national selectors adopted in terms of Clarke's rehabilitation. 

'He's a vital member of the Australian cricket team and it will be great to have him back on board,' he said. 

'He's been picked in the squad, which is great. There's nothing we want more than for him to push all the right buttons and get himself fit enough to play.'
