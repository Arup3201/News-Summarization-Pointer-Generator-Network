A Seattle marijuana grower has started selling a new strain of weed called 'Beast Mode', after the nickname of Seahawks star running back Marshawn Lynch.

Nate 'Diggity' Johnson, owner of Queen Anne Cannabis Club where Beast Mode is being sold, says he is getting into the Super Bowl spirit as the city's team prepare to play on Sunday.

He told the Seattle Times that the pot was named after Lynch because it's so strong, it hits you like a running back. 

While most medical-marijuana sold at 
Seattle dispensaries have a THC level of 12-20 per cent, Beast Mode has a
 THC content of 17.6 per cent making it one of the stronger strains 
Washington residents can purchase.

Beast Mode was produced by growers Zion Gardens, who were looking to develop a strain called Girl Scout Cookies.

When they tried the product at the end, however, they realized the weed was anything but sweet.

Mr Johnson says the effects of the strain start off slow and build before hitting 'like Beast Mode'.

'Marshawn has gears when he’s running and it’s kind of like that. It has a little bit of a slow start and then kicks in,' Mr Johnson told the Times.

The asking price for Beast Mode is $13 per gram or $150 per half ounce.

Washington dispensaries technically aren't allowed to charge for their product. Donations help pay for employees pay and the cost to keep the dispensary running.

As far as he knows, this is the only marijuana strain currently on the market named after a Seahawk.

While there may not be any other Seattle Seahawks-inspired marijuana strains, dispensaries in Colorado were selling pot named after Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning earlier this year. Colorado was the other state where marijuana became legal this year.

But naming a controlled substance after a football player brings up interesting legal questions.

Lynch has trademarked 'Beast Mode' for use on clothing and hats, and has further trademarks pending for sunglasses, headphones, bracelets and cleats.

Marijuana manufacturers have been told by legal experts that trademarks will most likely not apply to pot since there is a federal ban on the controlled substance.

Mr Johnson believes that since his business runs on donations only, Lynch won't sue for their use of his slogan.

When marijuana growers Good Meds started producing and selling lines of Peyton and Eli Manning pot, representatives for the elder Manning brother threatened to sue if they continued to use his name. 

It's uncertain whether Good Meds has continued to sell both Peyton and Eli Manning strains.

Calls to the dispensary were not immediately returned Wednesday morning.
