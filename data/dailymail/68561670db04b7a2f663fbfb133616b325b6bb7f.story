Pay and bonuses for Goldman Sachs bankers have soared by 10 per cent.

Employees have raked in an average of £170,000 – and that is for just the first six months of the year.

But with many staff involved in back office or temporary work, many high-flyers are likely to have received far larger sums.

Total pay for the bank’s 31,700 
global staff – 6,000 of whom work in the UK – swelled to £5.3billion in 
the first half of the year.

The big rise, at a time when millions of families are struggling, was criticised as ‘reminiscent of the pre-crisis days’.

Goldman Sachs’s profits have almost doubled as the Wall Street bank reported booming business.

For the last three months, pre-tax profits rose 87 per cent to £1.7billion and to £4billion for the first half of the year. Chief executive Lloyd Blankfein said the results were ‘solid’.

But David Hillman of the Robin Hood Tax 
campaign said: ‘Goldman Sachs’s bumper profit announcement is way out of
kilter with the rest of the economy and reminiscent of the pre-crisis 
days.

'Governments must learn the lessons of past mistakes and bring to an end our two-tier economy that benefits the banks.’

Despite the global downturn, last year Goldman paid staff more than £8billion, an average of £250,000 each. This year the group was heavily criticised over a scheme that would have helped its bankers avoid tax.

It planned to wait until April 6, when the top rate of tax fell from 50p to 45p, to pay 2012’s bonuses. It relented after a public backlash.
