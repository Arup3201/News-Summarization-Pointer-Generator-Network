The white supremacist couple who were wanted in connection with the death of a woman and disappearance of her husband have been arrested, and police believe they murdered the Oregon teenager who went missing last week.

Authorities are not sure how the paths of a teenager who called 
his mother daily and two white supremacists fleeing a murder scene in 
Washington state crossed in Western Oregon's Willamette Valley.

Cody Myers, from Oregon, who had thoughts of joining the ministry was found dead yesterday in woods near his home, the victim of 'homicidal violence'.

The two people who commandeered his 
car — subjects of a manhunt in the death of a Washington state woman and
disappearance of her husband — threw up their hands in surrender to 
police on Wednesday.

An Oregon sheriff called their week-long road trip by down the West Coast 'a vicious, vile reign of terror'.

Police had been searching for the couple after Leslie Pedersen, the 69-year-old stepmother of heavily-tattooed Pedersen, was found dead with her hands tied and a bloody pillow strapped to her head.

Investigators also linked the pair 
with the disappearance of Pederson's father, who has not been seen since
the slaying of his wife.

Oregon State Police confirmed that the body they discovered on Tuesday was that of teenager Myers and the cause of death was 'homicidal violence'.

Relatives and friends say he was studious, religious and caring.

'Cody was devoted to his family. He 
would've done anything for anybody to help anybody,' said his mother, 
Susan Myers. 'He had passion for life, for God, for his beliefs. He 
didn't deserve this.'

Exactly what took place in the woods west of Corvallis, Oregon, is unclear.

Police know that Grigsby and Pedersen
were spotted by a camera at a convenience store on Sunday, where they 
used a stolen credit card.

The card belonged to Pedersen's 
stepmother, Leslie Pedersen. She was found dead on September 28. His 
father, David Jones Pedersen, is still missing.

A martial-arts expert with a 
prominent white-supremacy tattoo on his neck, Pedersen spent the ages of
16 to 31 in one form of incarceration or another, save for a one-year 
stretch in the mid-2000s.

Even while in prison, Pedersen 
couldn't avoid trouble. Major disciplinary infractions included assault,
extortion, disobedience, harassment and destruction of property.

Grigsby, whose white supremacist 
leanings were made clear to her fellow inmates at Coffee Creek 
Correctional Facility, also found herself in trouble in prison, getting 
written up for assault and possession of contraband.

Oregon State Police said Pedersen and Grigsby were seen on Sunday morning in the Plymouth Breeze 
that Mr Myers was driving when he left his 
Willamette Valley home for the Oregon coastal town Newport for a jazz festival on Saturday.

Grigsby was dating Pedersen, but is married to Dannel Larson of Portland, Oregon.

He said his wife is simply gullible, 
the victim of a person capable of manipulating her into doing things she
never would otherwise

'That man,' Mr Larson said, 'took her on a road straight to hell.'

They somehow came into contact with 
Cody Myers, who worked two summers for a relative's construction 
company, said the company's owner, Mike Klein.

When the crews would go on the road, Cody would call his mother at least once a day.

His parents, brother and sister and 
other relatives were at a Wednesday night press conference in Salem 
where police confirmed the body that had been found was the missing 
teen's.

Details remain unclear. Pedersen and 
Grigsby have been named 'persons of interest'. They were found with 
handguns and rifles, all of them loaded, but police have not said how 
the 19-year-old died.

Pedersen and Grigsby come from a world inhabited by convicts, violence and white supremacists.

Grigsby's father, Fred Grigsby of 
Portland, said his daughter had been involved with white supremacists, 
and also had battled drug addiction.

'She went to treatment. I thought she got her life together,' he said.

Grigsby spent time in prison for a 
variety of charges beginning in 2006, including identity theft and 
unauthorized use of a vehicle.

After completing probation, she was again sentenced in 2008 on identity theft charges and served two years.

Her boyfriend, Pederson, has a white supremacist tattoo on his neck and convictions dating back to 1997.

He was first convicted of robbery at 
age 16 in Marion County, Oregon, and has spent a total of 13 years in 
prison for felony offences that include assault and robbery and sending a
letter threatening to kill a U.S. judge.

Pederson was released from prison in May. His time free of bars and handcuffs lasted 134 days.

On Wednesday afternoon, California Highway Patrol Officer Terry Uhrich was on a routine patrol in rural Yuba County.

He spotted a woman standing next to a parked vehicle, three of its doors open. A man was inside the car.

'I pulled up to the side of them, 
just thinking they were needing assistance or something like that. I 
asked the female if they were all right. She said they were fine, she 
was stretching, he said.

'It kind of hit me that dispatch had 
put out a BOL about an hour and a half before — be on lookout for a 
stolen vehicle out of Oregon and it had a male and female out of it.'

He ran the license number and 
confirmed it was Cody Myers' vehicle, then began following the couple as
they drove slowly down the road. After about two miles, they turned 
into a side road leading to a church, and Officer Uhrich followed them.

He turned on his patrol car lights, 
got out and, using his door as a shield, drew his sidearm and ordered 
them to turn off the engine.

They complied, keeping their hands where he could see them. They occasionally leaned over and kissed.

Other officers arrived within minutes
and arrested the couple, finding a rifle and two handguns inside the 
stolen car. The handguns were within reach of the suspects.

They were taken to a Yuba City police
department holding cell to await interviews by the Oregon State Police 
and Everett, Washington, police.

Officer Uhrich said they acted tranquil, 'like they knew it kind of was over'.
