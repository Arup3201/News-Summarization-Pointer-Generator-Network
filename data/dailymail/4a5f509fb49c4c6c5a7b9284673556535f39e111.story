Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football... with some star turns and a look through the leagues, too. This week includes Adam Johnson's nightmare League Cup final, Arsene Wenger's error in dropping Mathieu Flamini for the trip to Stoke and Fulham's managerial woes.

1) Arsene Wenger’s decision to leave Mathieu Flamini out of the team at Stoke forced Jack Wilshere to take a deeper role – meaning the England star effectively played with the handbrake on.

Nearly half of the passes he played were in Arsenal’s half of the field, and he failed to create a single chance for a team mate before going off nine minutes from the end.

It was the first time in ten matches that Wilshere has not either made a chance or had a goal attempt of his own.

2) Adam Johnson has been the catalyst for Sunderland’s best form of late and looked as if he could be a Wembley star when he set up Fabio Borini’s early goal.

After that, though, he suffered a nightmare against his former Manchester City team mates.

They tightened up on him so much that by the time he went off with half an hour to go he had found a team mate with only two other passes.

In all he only touched the ball 21 times, losing possession on 13 of those occasions, and got in just one cross.

3) Joe Allen has never really established himself at Liverpool since he followed Brendan Rodgers from Swansea as the first big buy of his management reign.

If anything stops the 23-year-old from making it at Anfield, though, it won’t be lack of effort.

Given his first start of 2014 at Southampton, EA Sports stats show he ran 7.9miles during 90 minutes of effort to contribute to the 3-0 win.

No player in any Saturday’s Premier League games went further, and his total of 63 sprints was only matched by Chelsea’s hat-trick hero Andre Schurrle.

4) It’s just like old times in the North West – a 4-1 win for United and a good performance by somebody called Neville.

That won’t be any comfort for David Moyes, though.  It was FC United of Manchester who beat Droylsden at Gigg Lane in front of a crowd of nearly 2,000, to move into the play-off places in the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League.

The Neville was left winger Lee who made a telling contribution as a second half substitute - but is no relation to Gary or Phil.

5) Fulham have suffered from some odd management decisions all season and it looks as if Felix Magath has dropped straight into the pattern.

Lewis Holtby was not only his best player in his first match in charge at West Brom, but also helped the boss by translating the manager’s instructions from German.

His reward was to be left on the subs bench against Chelsea – getting on only for the final 28 minutes when although he created a chance it was too late to rescue the game.

6) Cardiff owner Vincent Tan has praised Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for bringing in seven new players for an outlay of just £6million during the January transfer window.

Clearly you get what you pay for. Solskjaer used all of his new boys and started five of them in the 4-0 thrashing by Hull a week ago.

By this weekend he’d axed all but Cala and Fabio from his starting line-up at Tottenham with only Kenwyne Jones and Mats Daehli coming off the bench – and Fabio was one of the players he subbed.

The 1-0 reverse at Spurs meant the Bluebirds (or is it Redbirds these days?) suffered their fifth defeat in seven Premier League games since the former Manchester United star took charge.

7) Dean Saunders has yet to find another job in football since failing to stop Wolves slide to a second successive relegation during an ill-fated spell in charge at Molineux last season.

The former Liverpool and Villa star should at least be given credit, though, for being brave enough to give defender Danny Baath his first team chance amid the wreckage of a disastrous campaign.

The 23-year-old has grown from there as the cornerstone of Kenny Jackett’s team this season, and was excellent in the 3-0 win over Port Vale that put the club top of the table.  He is the only ever-present in 32 League One games so far.

8) Chris Martin’s red card in Derby’s defeat at Burnley might mean striker Conor Sammon finally gets the chance to start a game when Steve McClaren picks his side to face Millwall at home next week.

The lanky Irishman, 27, came on as a half time sub at Burnley as former England boss McClaren tried to orchestrate a fightback before his ten men ultimately lost 2-0.

If the former Wigan star does get to play next week it will be only his second start of the season – despite coming on as substitute an incredible 27 times.

9) Middlesbrough will be leading the campaign for goal-line technology in the Championship as well as the Premier League as their barren run now stretches to more than 700 minutes without scoring.

Tough times: Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka has seen his side go without a goal for over 700 minutes

Jacob Butterfield thought he’d brought the wait to an end with a 20-yard drive against Sheffield Wednesday which appeared to go a foot over the line.

Sadly for Boro boss Aitor Karanka, who last saw his team score back on January 18th, ref Andy D’Urso had to accept the advice of his assistant Paul Hodkinson who didn’t give the goal.

Just to make matters worse for Boro they ended up losing to another controversial decision when Dean Whitehead was sent off for handling Leon Best’s shot on the line, and Atdhe Nuhiu scored the resultant penalty.

10) Plymouth’s board were brave when they stuck by John Sheridan early in the season – they were just two points above the relegation zone in October after losing to ten-man Hartlepool.

They have got their reward in a sustained run of form since – and Saturday’s 5-0 thrashing of Morecambe made it four wins in the last five games.

A crowd of nearly 7,000 saw Lewis Alessandra score twice and the Pilgrims are now two points outside the League Two play-off zone with a game in hand over seventh placed Southend.
