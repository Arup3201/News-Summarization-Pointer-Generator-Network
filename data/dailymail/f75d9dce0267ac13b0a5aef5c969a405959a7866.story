A survivor of the horrific parking garage collapse on a South Florida college campus has spoken out about his ordeal, throwing himself from the stricken construction as it fell to the ground, killing four and injuring eight.

Anthony Williams described the moment the building gave way on Wednesday as sounding 'like an earthquake, like someone put a stick of dynamite in it.'

'I was thinking of my mom and my 9-year-old daughter,' the 27-year-old labourer told CBS.

'Right now, I am really shook up and terrified. I still have nightmare and dreams. I can still feel the building shaking.'

Help: Rescue workers attend to a construction worker injured in the collapse that did not hurt any students

Williams had only begun work at the Miami-Dade College site on the day of the accident.

He leapt from the second floor in a 
desperate move that saved his life, but others weren't so lucky.

The 
bodies of three dead workers have been removed, with a fourth remaining 
trapped inside.

Although the missing man's death will
not be confirmed until his remains are found, officials are calling 
their search for him a 'recovery mission' rather than one of rescue.

'I remember coming back after my lunch break and seeing a crack in the building on the 5th floor,' Williams continued.

'That was just ten minutes before 
this crash happened. I told someone about it. I heard a crash and saw 
the building was going down. I jumped from the 2nd floor and it saved my
life.

'I did that to get away, it was my only chance, otherwise I'd get caught and it would have been the end of my life.

'Right now my body is really sore. I 
jumped from that high a place. My legs and my toes hurt and my back 
hurts. I don't think I'll ever work in a garage again.'

As the injured recover in hospital and families of the deceased grieve 
their loss, attorneys are considering lawsuits pending the results of an
investigation into what happened to cause the fatal accident.

'We don't know the cause, but we're going to find out,' Robert 
Rubenstein told the neews channel.

'We're concerned for the families. 
Until we get information from OSHA and the investigation is complete, we
won't know whose fault this is.

'A lot of people died in this tragedy. This is a tragedy that should not have happened.'

Addressing the media on Friday, Bill 
Byrne, CEO of the construction company behind the work, Ajax Building 
Corp, confirmed that a crane had bumped a column early in the week.

'It is my understanding that there was an incident where the crane bumped a column,' he said.

'It didn't cause any damage to the 
column. The crane was repaired and inspected and it was rectified and 
the engineer looked at the column and deemed that it was perfectly 
safe.'

But as Williams has since asked: 'If they knew that the crane hit the building, why would they send us out there?'

Teams are continue to probe the site,
searching for the final worker, electrician Robert Buhdoo.

But the 
man's family say they are distressed at how long his recovery is taking,
adding that they have not given up hope of him being found alive.

'I'm tired of being quiet, taking 
whatever they give me,' Tasha Bagwandeen, Buhdoo's daughter said. 'I'm 
not going to do that. I need answers and I need them now.

'It's not fair. My dad is laying 
there somewhere hanging on for dear life. And they're taking their own 
little time saying he's not alive. They have no proof. He needs somebody
to rescue him.'

The third construction worker died on
Wednesday, after rescuers were forced to amputate his legs following 13
hours trapped under tons of concrete when the five-floor garage 
collapsed.

Samuel Perez, 53, was pronounced dead soon after being flown to a Miami trauma center around midnight for surgery.Â 

Rescuers
could hear his cries soon after the building collapsed - and once they 
located him in the cabin of a truck, they had to amputate his legs above
the knees at the scene.

The two other fatalities have been identified as Carlos Hurtado Demendoza, 48, and Jose Calderon, 60.

Reporters and horrified onlookers who were kept 
across the street from the collapsed garage could see Perez being 
carried on a stretcher from the rubble to an awaiting ambulance and then
driven away.

He was accompanied by two physicians who had been treating him with and IV and oxygen during the hours he was trapped.

The
worker was located by rescuers who heard his cries from amid the rubble
not long after the roof of the five-story garage fell, creating a 
pancake-style collapse.

A third man was pulled out alive from the rubble and brought to a hospital shortly after the collapse on Wednesday.

A
video shot by Miami-Dade Fire-Rescue showed four firefighters pulling 
him out from under a steel beam. His face and hands were bloody and he 
was put on a stretcher and carried away.

Seven workers were brought to the hospital with unidentified injuries while an eighth was treated on the scene and sent home.

No students were in the area at the time. The campus was evacuated and closed for the rest of the week.

Investigators are now planning to pick through the rubble to see what caused the garage to crumble.

'We just know that the roof collapsed,' said Miami-Dade Fire-Rescue spokeswoman Griselle 
Marino.

Searching: The $22.5 million project was to be completed in December, according to Ajax Building Corporation's website

Late
on Wednesday, a man at the scene who declined to identify himself said 
he believed his brother, who was working at the garage at the time of 
the collapse, was still inside somewhere.

Miami-Dade
Fire-Rescue 
Assistant Chief David Downey said it was highly unlikely anyone left in 
the rubble would still be alive, and that authorities would now focus on
recovery rather than rescue.

Firefighters
began packing up their gear after the latest survivor was rescued, but 
expected to be back by dawn to continue the recovery efforts, Downey 
said.

Victoria Buczynski of 
Miami said she saw the collapse while she was working at Gurkha Cigars 
across the street from the construction site at the Miami-Dade College.

'It
fell to the ground like a house of cards,' Buczynski said. 'The 
construction workers started running out, screaming. It was loud. Our 
entire building shook.'

Byrne said an internal review was being 
launched to determine the cause.

Byrne said the company would embrace 'any additional protocols, policies and procedures that will enhance and
ensure the continued priority of safety.'

Ground
was broken on the $22.5 million project in February, and the 
1,855-space garage was to be finished in December, according to Ajax's 
website.

The first floor was
to have classroom and office space. The structure is next to the 
college's main office building and nestled among other campus buildings.

The
college serves about 8,000 students and is one of several campuses in 
the Miami-Dade College system. This campus opened in 2006.
