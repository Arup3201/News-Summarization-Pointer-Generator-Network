Rick Parfitt, Status Quo guitarist, is on the road to recovery

The son of Status Quo guitarist Rick Parfitt yesterday revealed his father is on the road to recovery and is expected to be ‘back rocking soon’.

The band was forced to cancel a number of concerts after Parfitt, 65, fell ill on Friday night and was rushed to hospital where he was kept overnight.

Taking to social networking site Twitter on Sunday afternoon, Parfitt’s son, also called Rick, posted: ‘Thank you for all the kind well wishes. Have spoken to dad today and all signs are good that he will be back rocking soon.’

Other tweets from him suggest his father may have become unwell because he over-exerted himself: ‘Hi all,...just to say that Dad is ok, but he has to stop thinking he is invincible that is all I can say right now. #WorriedandUpset.'

And: ‘You cant help people who don’t want to be helped, no matter how much you care about them.’

Status Quo are currently on their European tour and were due to perform in Pula, Croatia at the weekend but the gig was abandoned, along with five other shows that were going to take place in Monte Carlo, Switzerland and Germany.  

According to the band’s official site, the next performance will take place on August 15 in Nottingham.

Parfitt, who has previously suffered from ill health, had a quadruple heart bypass in 1997 after doctors warned him about his dangerous rock and roll lifestyle fuelled by drink and drugs.

In 2005, he had to cancel a tour to undergo tests for suspected throat cancer.

He has previously revealed his fears he will not see his young twins Lilly Rose and Tommy Oswald grow up.

Speaking last November, he admitted: 'I probably won’t. Even if I live to 80 they will just about be 20. I would love to see them get to 21.

'It frightens the life out of me when I think I’m not going to see them grow up, and to see what they do and what they become.

His son Rick Parfitt Junior took to Twitter to thank fans for their well wishes and say 'all signs are good'

'I know it’s morbid, but I’m only being realistic. I won’t be around.'

Despite life-saving bypass surgery, he vowed not to become dull, adding he still enjoyed the 'odd pint'.

It is unclear whether Status Quo, famed for hits such as Whatever You Want and Rockin’ All Over The World, will be able to press ahead with their UK tour in December.

More information on Parfitt’s condition is expected to be released on Tuesday.
