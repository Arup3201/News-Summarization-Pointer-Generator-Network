A series of mutilated animals have been found on the streets on Sacramento, leading officials to fear a local cult may be responsible.

The latest discovery - the third in as many days - was made yesterday by a Sacramento Bee reporter investigating the killings.

He found a bag of decapitated chickens along railroad tracks in California's capital city.

On Tuesday night, authorities reported finding two bags containing dead animals also beside railroad tracks in Midtown Sacramento.

One bag contained a beheaded rabbit with several tea candles. 

A second bag held at least two decapitated chickens with their feet cut off, News10 reported.

Gina Knepp, head of Sacramento's Front Street Animal Shelter, said authorities are investigating whether at least some of the killings may be tied to religious rites that sacrifice animals.

She explained tips have been pouring in, many of them suggesting the findings are linked to a cult.

'Local cults, religious groups. Nothing solid, you know, but it is very bizarre,' she said.

'The most recent case I will say involves what appears to be some type of ritual, who knows what kind of practice,' she told the Sacramento Bee. 

She added, others cases may be simply a case of copycats following the growing news coverage of the incidents.

Two decapitated chickens were found in a box along a bike trail near the Sacramento River on Monday. 

Inside the box were also five blood-soaked $1 bills.

There have been at least nine separate discoveries of decapitated goats, sheep and chickens and other animals since the start of the year at various locations in Sacramento. 

But the mystery began last fall,  when a 120lb cow's head was found in Reichmuth Park and another one was found a few miles away at Garcia Bend Park.
