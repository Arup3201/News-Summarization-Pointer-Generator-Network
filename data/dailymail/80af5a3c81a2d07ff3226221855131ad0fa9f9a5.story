Thousands of bibles could be removed from university accommodation after they were branded 'inappropriate' in a multicultural environment.

More than half of students surveyed at Aberystwyth University said they felt the compulsory inclusion of the book from Gideon International was 'uncomfortable' or 'unacceptable'.

A proposal to have all bibles withdrawn from university-owned bedrooms will be put forward by the university's Students' Union council  at a meeting later this month.

Bibles could be removed from rooms at Aberystwyth University after more than half of students surveyed said the compulsory inclusion of the book from Gideon International was 'uncomfortable' or 'unacceptable'

The US-based Christian organisation has been providing free bibles to universities for several years and has distributed 1.8billion globally to hotels, hospitals and care homes since 1908.

A survey of students at Pentre Jane Morgan halls of residence was conducted by Aberystwyth Students' Union.

It found that around 50 per cent of respondents found the compulsory inclusion of Bibles 'uncomfortable' or 'unacceptable' and only four per cent stated that it was a 'good idea'.

The matter was raised at a student council meeting by student John David Morgan on January 22, where 50 people showed up.

The motion, put forward at a student union council meeting, will be discussed later this month following results from the survey at Aberystwyth University (pictured)

He said the 'inclusion of Bibles in university bedrooms is inappropriate in a multicultural university such as Aberystwyth.'

'It could be offensive for some, and the university should provide a safe space for students to explore and develop their beliefs in a neutral environment.

'Bibles should, however, still be available for those who wish to have them,' he added.  

The motion calls for all bibles to be removed from university bedrooms at the end of the current academic year.

Mr Morgan proposed replacing it with an option in the accommodation application process to allow students to have a bible in their bedroom should they so wish.

University bosses said it will review the policy if Aberystwyth Students' Union back their removal.

An Aberystwyth University spokesman said that the books are 'replenished annually' and that there is no fine if they are taken from the rooms.

The new rooms at the recently-opened Penglais Farm have yet to receive bibles, the spokesman added. 

Gideon International did not wish to comment on the recent proposal. 

James Catford, a former student of Aberystwyth University, and now the Group Chief Executive of Bible Society said:

'The answer to a diverse and multicultural society is not to remove all traces of diversity. That seems illiberal and intolerant. 

'As a graduate of the university, I would challenge those who are voting to spend some time with Luke's Gospel, for example, so they can make an informed decision. 

'No student would vote in the General Election without knowing what each party and candidate stood for, and the same should be true of this vote. 

University bosses said it will review the policy if Aberystwyth Students' Union back the proposal to have the bibles removed by the end of the current academic year

'Many people think they know what the Bible stands for but our research shows that nine out of ten don't engage with it – so the students might be surprised if they do.'

Reverend Ian Girling, Vicar of Holy Trinity Church, Aberystwyth, added: 'These bibles are a free gift to the students and have helped many over the years through difficult times so it would be a great shame to lose them. 

'However, we, as local churches and chaplains, will continue to welcome all students to come and see us, whatever their circumstances and needs.'

Other universities have banned Gideon Bibles removed in the past including Huddersfield University in 2013, which said it wanted its properties to be 'ethically neutral'.

It also claimed to removed them because many of the students are from overseas, however, the move was branded 'anti-Christian' by Rev Mike Smith, a former minister at Huddersfield's Golcar Baptist Church. 

Stirling University Students' Association (SUSA) also called to have them removed from halls of residence, claiming it was 'presumptuous' and offensive to different religions on the campus.

Last year, one of Britain's largest hotel chains - Travelodge - removed bibles from all its bedrooms for 'diversity reasons'.

It said the policy was implemented 'in order not to discriminate against any religion' – despite having had no complaints from guests at any of its 500 hotels.

Bibles were taken away at the same time as a refurbishment of its rooms, removing drawers where they were kept. 

The Gideon Society was founded in 1898 and has distributed 1.8billion free bibles in hotels, hospitals, prisons, care homes, medical centres as well as student accommodation

The practice of placing Bibles in British hotel rooms originated with the Commercial Travellers' Christian Association late in the Victorian era.

The organisation was founded in 1888, with backing from the owners of biscuit manufacturer McVitie's, and donated bibles to hotels around the country.

In more recent years, the work was taken over by the Gideon Society, which distributes free Bibles in almost 194 countries worldwide.

Members of the Gideon Society, an evangelical Christian organisation founded in the US in 1898, were inspired to give out free Bibles in hotel rooms after visiting Britain and seeing the Commercial Travellers' Christian Association's work.

In the UK, the Gideon Society, whose income comes from donations and bequests from wills, still continues this mission – giving out free bibles to large institutions, including hospitals and prisons.

Copies of the New Testament are also presented to school pupils, members of the armed forces, police, ambulance and fire services.
