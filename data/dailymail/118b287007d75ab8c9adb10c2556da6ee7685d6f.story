Anthea Turner has kicked her husband Grant Bovey out of their £5 million home after confronting him over claims that he was having an affair with a 24-year-old woman.

The television presenter asked 
property developer Bovey, 50, to leave the five-bedroom property in 
Esher, Surrey, last week after being told by a friend that he had been 
seen kissing a young woman in a  London restaurant.

Bovey is said to have 
admitted being friends with the woman but denied they were having an 
affair while Ms Turner, 52, was working  on a Canadian TV show.

Considering her future: Anthea Turner, with Grant Bovey, is said to be devastated

A
friend of Anthea’s told The Mail on Sunday: ‘She confronted Grant last 
week. She told him she wanted to know what was going on.

‘He said, “You went off to Canada, I met this girl, but she’s just a friend.”

‘Anthea didn’t believe him. She had been told by someone she trusted that 
Grant had been seen out with this girl in London and they looked more 
than friends.

'Someone saw them kissing in a restaurant. Anthea is 
heartbroken.

‘She is not taking phone calls because she can’t help breaking down in tears.’

Bovey left his first wife, Della,  for Ms Turner in 1998 and the  couple married two years later.  

He is understood to be staying at a London hotel while Anthea – who  is being comforted by her stepdaughters Lily, Amelia and Claudia – considers her future.

The couple's £5 million Surrey home, with Anthea has asked her husband of 12 years to leave

The couple managed to keep hold of their luxury home, despite Grant being declared bankrupt last year

On Friday Ms Turner, a former GMTV 
presenter and once one of the highest profile women on television, gave 
no hint of the couple’s   problems when she posted a series of messages 
on Twitter.

She tweeted: ‘Olympic goulash being made bunting up. Party tonight for opening ceremony so exited [sic].’

She
continued: ‘@ameliabovey  @claudiabovey @lilybovey all watching the 
most amazing TV spectacular Olympic opening. Proud to be British.’

A source close to the presenter  said Lily, 20, Amelia, 19, and Claudia, 16, remained her priority and their support had helped give her the strength to kick out Bovey.

The source said: ‘Anthea is very close to the girls and wants that relationship to continue.

'She doesn’t want to be seen being nasty about their dad but right now she wants to take some time out to consider her next move.

‘Grant was declared bankrupt three years ago and since then Anthea has been working in Canada to keep their finances afloat.

The pair married in 2000 after meeting two years earlier, when Grant left his wife for Anthea

'She did three series of her show to earn money and keep the family together and while she’s been working hard, he’s been doing this.

‘She would go to Canada for three weeks at a time, then come back  for two weeks, and it was while she was away that she believes this  was going on.’

Ms Turner found fame on Blue Peter, breakfast programme GMTV and BBC’s Top Of The Pops and was once married to former Radio 1  DJ Peter Powell.

But her squeaky clean image was shattered when it was disclosed she was having an affair with Bovey, who was a family friend.

Their  wedding in 2000 was a public  relations disaster when it was revealed the couple had signed a £450,000 contract to pose for a magazine shoot while eating a new chocolate bar.

Ms Turner subsequently struggled to find mainstream presenting  work and took part in Channel 4’s reality series Celebrity Big Brother in 2001.

She and Bovey moved into the property business, launching Imagine Homes, which became Britain’s biggest buy-to-let property firm.

But it was one of the first victims  of the financial crisis when it went into administration in 2008 with debts of up to £50 million.

Bovey was discharged from bankruptcy in March 2011 and a month later he and Ms Turner moved into their new home in Esher, where neighbours include former England football captain John Terry and quiz show host Chris Tarrant.

Two years ago Ms Turner signed up to appear as a judge for Canadian reality series Dinner Party Wars, on Food Network Canada.

During the  programme couples are rated for their skill at hosting dinner parties.

A spokesman for Ms Turner said last night: ‘Anthea is devastated.’
