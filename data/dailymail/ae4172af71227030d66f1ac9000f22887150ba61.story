Victory: Polish born Barbara Jurga, 56, above, who has won her harassment claim after being told not speak her native tongue to children in the school, even though some of them were Polish

A Polish nursery school teacher who was banned from speaking her native language at work has won a £7,000 payout for harassment.

Barbara Jurga, 56, complained that Lisa Howes, deputy head of Lavendale Montessori nursery School in London, branded her mother tongue 'one of those weird languages’.

Married mother-of-four Mrs Jurga told how she had some children in her class who were Polish and spoke English as a second language.

She said that their parents spoke to her in Polish and asked her to help their children by using the language when necessary.

But Ms Howes banned Mrs Jurga from speaking any Polish, even to colleagues when she was on her break.

Mrs Jurga then complained to couple Nuala and Neil Todd, owners of Lavendale Montessori nursery school in Woodside Park, north London.

But after quitting her job and issuing her tribunal claim, Mr Todd, a retired Metropolitan Poice Senior Detective sent her 'intimidating' letters.

A panel at Watford employment tribunal found the school guilty of race discrimination, harassment and victimisation.

The school then agreed to pay Mrs Jurga £7,000 in compensation for injury to feelings.

Mrs Jurga, of Burnt Oak, north-west London, is originally from Poznan, Poland.

She settled in the UK in 1991 and joined the school in January 2009.

She first complained to the nursery owners that in 2011 after Ms Howes had instructed her: ‘No Polish language to be spoken in the nursery’.

Ms Howes told the tribunal she considered it 'rude and exclusionary' for staff to speak to each other in Polish during breaks.

But Mrs Jurga insisted it was a 'fundamental right' of staff to use their preferred language in their free time away from the classroom.

She also said that national education guidelines provided that where teachers are able to speak a pupil’s first language, they should do so when it is in the child’s best interests.

After her complaints were repeatedly ignored, Mrs Jurga resigned in May 2012 and brought a race discrimination claim.

Mr Todd, 60, then wrote to her saying staff would attend the tribunal and prove her allegations to be

'false and vindictive'.

He warned her: 'I look forward to making financial claim against your lies.'

Multicultural: Mrs Jurga said her first language was useful for speaking to Polish students at the Lavendale Montessori nursery school in Woodside Park, north London, above

Giving evidence, Mr Todd told the tribunal: 'I wrote it because it became ever more clear what Mrs Jurga was after, namely to get a few pounds at the cost of the nursery by abusing the tribunal system.'

In a second letter in November 2012, Mr Todd threatened Mrs Jurga for contacting witnesses who might support her case.

He wrote: 'I am of the strong opinion that I now have sufficient evidence to present to my solicitor and seek instructions regarding your activities in trying to pervert the course of justice.'

Mrs Jurga told the tribunal: 'I believe this was deliberately threatening. I feel completely bullied.'

In its judgment, the panel ruled it was 'entirely reasonable' for Mrs Jurga to object to being banned from speaking Polish in appropriate circumstances.

Victimised: Mrs Jurga, who was born in Poznan, received threatening letters from the nursery's owner, Neil Todd, after she threatened tribunal action

Ruling on Mr Todd’s letters, the panel found: 'It has to be remembered when considering this that Mr Todd is not unfamiliar with the legal process.

'He is a retired senior detective from the Metropolitan Police as he told us.

'Anyone can approach a witness. It is likely we suspect that Mr Todd knew this too.'

It ruled that his 'totally disproportionate' attempt to put her off her legal action amounted to victimisation.

Speaking after the judgment, Mrs Jurga said she felt 'happy and relieved' to have won. She said: 'I feel that finally justice has been done.

'As a dedicated Montessori school teacher, I believe in its founding philosophy which promotes the freedom of the individual and rejects all prejudice.'

Her solicitor Nick Fry, of law firm Bindmans, said: 'This decision should highlight for employers the importance of addressing discrimination complaints early to promote equal opportunities and prevent workplace relations from deteriorating.'

Mrs Jurga, who now works at another north London Montessori nursery school, failed in her claim that she was constructively dismissed on the grounds of race.

The school declined to comment on the judgment.
