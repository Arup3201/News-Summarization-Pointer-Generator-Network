A young married couple who plotted to abuse children as part of a paedophile love triangle are facing jail after police uncovered 'horrific' texts and indecent images of children and animals.

Kevin Barnett, 28, suggested drugging youngsters so he could enact his sick desires and his wife Susan, 28, said she would be willing to comfort a child as it was raped, a court heard.

The pair were found guilty of arranging the commission of a child sexual offence and a second woman, Nikita Moore, 22, was convicted of conspiracy to commit child sexual offences with Barnett.

Moore had even discussed having a baby with Barnett, from Barrow, Cumbria, for them to abuse together - although prosecutors  conceded this particular 'horrific' exchange was just fantasy.

The 22-year-old was sending messages to Barnett saying she thought about sexually abusing children 'all the time' when sick exchanges between the married couple were still continuing.

Although both women were eager to please Barnett as he made increasingly disturbing suggestions, the Preston Crown Court heard he was the driving force behind the criminal activity.

Mr Brown told the court how Barnett took advantage of the women's feelings and exploited their desperation for his own sexual gratification - at one stage having a threesome with both women.

Detectives were able to stop the would-be child abusers after officers were called to a domestic disturbance between, Barnett and a woman unrelated to the case.

Officers examined his phone after a tip off and the three defendants were arrested after detectives trawled through the sick messages.

All three denied the charges and argued the texts had been a 'fantasy' with no real intent to act on them.

The jury had to decide whether or not the messages represented a genuine plan to sexually abuse children.

Moore began an affair with  Barnett shortly after the death of her long term partner Jason Baines, who killed himself in October 2013. 

The 22-year-old, originally from Birmingham, said the two had indulged in 'unconventional' sexual practices.

Their relationship ended in early 2014 when Moore discovered Barnett was also having an affair with another woman.

After admitting the affair to Mrs Barnett, Moore said the two women had become 'really close' and began living together in Barrow.

But Moore continued to secretly exchange messages with Kevin Barnett discussing underage sex and sharing indecent images of children.  

Summing up the case, Judge Christopher Cornwell told the jury: 'You have heard the text exchange which at times no doubt disgusted you. We could go on and on with the disgust but the central question never goes away. Was there a conclusive agreement and was there an agreement that it should be put into action?'

Moore and Kevin Barnett had previously pleaded guilty to offences relating to indecent images of children.

Mrs Barnett had also pleaded guilty to possessing extreme pornography depicting sex with animals.

The defendants will next appear at Preston Crown Court for sentencing for all the offences on February 5 next year. 

Judge Cornwall said: 'I don't see any alternative to immediate imprisonment.'

Acting Detective Inspector Brian Murray, of the South Cumbria Public Protection Unit, said: 'I am pleased that justice has been served today and these three individuals will be facing prison for their crimes.

'Thankfully cases like this are extremely rare in Cumbria and the quick arrests of these three people once information came to light show that we are committed to protecting children in Cumbria.'
