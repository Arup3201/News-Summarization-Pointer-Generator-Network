T-Mobile have announced that they will no longer hit customers with added fees for use of their text and data services when they are abroad.

In a bid to woo international users, they will also cap charges for international voice calls.

Starting from the end of this month, customers of T-Mobile's flagship Simple Choice plan will not be subject to the data roaming charges which can see the cost of phone bills soar during trips overseas.

The controversial fees can reach hundreds or thousands of dollars for a single trip even when customers travel to neighboring Canada or Mexico.

The communications company, which is the No. 4 U.S. cellphone carrier, has been trying to distance itself from their rivals by ditching the standard practice of cashing in on international services.

They have even branded themselves the 'Un-carrier' in a bid to break clear from the established pack.

The company sounded their intentions to break with tradition in March this year when they dropped conventional two-year service contracts in favor of installment based contracts.

In July, it introduced a program that lets people upgrade phones up to twice a year, a move that rivals AT&T, Verizon and Sprint were quick to follow.

T-Mobile CEO John Legere said their change of approach to data charges was a move gain more customers without sacrificing profits.

He said that because the company does not have currently have many international customers, they are not making huge profits from the sky-high data roaming fees which are common today.

According to NBC, Legere said that by offering to cap call fees and cut data and text charges altogether, the company could attract a new type of customer without losing out on what they already make.

T-Mobile have also planned to grow their revenue with by offering higher-speed roaming plans at $15 for a day or $25 for a week.

The free plan will be good enough for basic internet use.

But the paid option will give customers the option of watching high-definition video and using other streaming services.

T-Mobile's forward thinking changes appear to have already benefited the company since shorter contracts and quick upgrades were introduced this year.

T-Mobile US Inc. added a net 688,000 good credit and long-term customers in the latest quarter, compared with a loss of 557,000 in the same period a year earlier.

That boost was in part due to the launch of Apple's iPhone on the service, which they provided for the first time in April.

The new plan is likely to appeal to customers who travel frequently to any of the covered countries.

Major countries on every continent except Antarctica will be covered and officials say the list includes the vast majority of the places Americans visit.

Added extras: Users who wish to access data streaming services can pay for better internet access abroad

In addition to free data and texting while traveling in those countries, customers will pay a flat rate of 20 cents per minute for voice calls to any of those same countries or the U.S. T-Mobile and other carriers now charge $1 or more a minute in many countries.

For an additional $10 a month, customers will also get free calling from the U.S. to landlines in more than 70 countries.

Calls to other countries in the program or to other mobile phones will be 12 to 20 cents a minute, the company said.

Data roaming will be where customers save most but there will be some limits for frequent travelers.

Any trip abroad needs to be six weeks or less, and customers need to spend at least half their time in the U.S. in any three-month period meaning that the tariff is not for for students spending a year abroad, for instance.

T-Mobile also announced Wednesday that its high-speed 4G LTE network now reaches 200 million people in 233 metropolitan areas.

Legere said the company's network might not be as good as rivals in every rural pocket in the U.S., but it's fast in major cities.Â
