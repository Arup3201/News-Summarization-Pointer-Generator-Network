A woman has been ordered by a Western Australian court to pay $12,500 worth in damages to her estranged husband after it was found she had defamed him on Facebook.

In December 2012, a post appeared on Robyn Greeuw's social media page saying she had 'separated from Miro Dabrowski after 18 years of suffering domestic violence and abuse. Now fighting the system to keep my children safe'.

But Western Australian District Court Judge Michael Bowden ruled Ms Greeuw was unable to prove she had been subjected to this behaviour, despite finding holes in Mr Dabrowski's case.

Robyn Greeuw posted on her social media page that she had 'separated from Miro Dabrowski after 18 years of suffering domestic violence and abuse'

'Even applying the extended definition of the words "domestic violence and abuse", as urged by Ms Greeuw, she has failed to prove any essential or substantial truth to the stings of the defamation imputations,' he said.

The post on the Bunbury mother-of-two's page was seen by Mr Dabrowski's brother as well as a woman he started dating in 2012. It was not removed until February 2013.

During the trial, Ms Greeuw maintained she was did not know how to use Facebook and had only started using it just months before the December 2012 post went up.

She said the post was 'a complete fabrication and part of a malicious and vindictive campaign' against her carried out by Mr Dabrowski and other people.

The only reference Ms Greeuw was able to produce as evidence of the violence and abuse she claims to have suffered was a 2010 incident.

Mr Dabrowski later penned a letter to apologise to his wife for his 'freak out' and 'spoiling the holiday'.

The letter was presented as evidence during the trial and read: 'I don't deal with my panic attacks well … the panic and freak out period I had re holidays just showed that'.

But Mr Dabrowski told the court this referred to 'his internal state of mind' but Judge Bowden said this defence 'lacked credibility'.

WA District Court Judge Michael Bowden said he had 'no doubt' Ms Greeuw's post had caused Mr Dabrowski 'personal distress, humiliation and hurt and harm to his reputation' 

However, the judge said this did not mean he accepted Ms Greeuw's version of events.

He believed she had a 'propensity to say whatever advances her cause' and was 'not a credible witness'. 

Judge Bowden said he had 'no doubt' Ms Greeuw's post had caused Mr Dabrowski  'personal distress, humiliation and hurt and harm to his reputation'.

'It did cause people to "look at him twice" and be more reserved about their contact with him,' the judge said.

During the civil trial, a number of witnesses said the post had altered their perception of the school teacher to the point where they questioned their association with him and his behaviour.

As he was handing down his ruling, Judge Bowden said content on social media had a way of spreading quickly and damages would be awarded to Mr Dabrowski 'as reparation for the harm done to his personal and business reputation and for vindication to his reputation'.

'Defamatory publications on social media spread easily by the simple manipulation of computers,' he said.

'A public Facebook page is able to be viewed worldwide by whoever clicks on that page.'
