A bounty of 16th century treasure discovered perfectly preserved in a 500-year-old shipwreck is to go on sale in Britain for £200,000.

Specialist divers spent two years extracting the pewter plates and bowls from beneath the waves off the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean.

More than 1,200 items of the finest quality English pewter were recovered from the wreck of the unnamed galleon which is thought to have sunk around 1540.

They have been so well preserved in the sea bed that they are said to be as historically valuable as those raised from the wreck of the Mary Rose, the flagship of Henry VIII's fleet rescued from the Solent in 1982.

Despite sinking in 1545 during a battle with the French, the starboard hull remained intact on the seabed, along with 19,000 carefully retrieved items.

It is believed the ship was transporting the incoming Spanish ambassador from Seville to his new colonial home on the island of Hispaniola, now the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

Onboard was thousands of top quality dining sets bound for the tables of his luxurious mansion.

But disaster struck when the ship sunk after hitting rocks on the easternmost tip of the island off Punta Cana.

Experts say the ambassador was the 
only survivor of the wreck - but his expensive possessions were not so 
fortunate and they went down with the ship.The wreck was only discovered
 in 2011 and the excavation process is still ongoing.

Three quarters of the items discovered 
will remain in the possession of the Dominican Republic while the rest 
has been given to the treasure hunting divers.

The salvage team had to chisel through several inches of rock to uncover the stunning artefacts. Some pieces are said to be in as good a condition as when they were made.

Around a third of the pewter bears 
the mark of Sir Thomas Curtis, regarded as the most important London 
pewterer of the 16th Century.

Sir
 Thomas was Mayor of London in 1557 and his mark also appears on much of
 the pewter from the Mary Rose, Henry VIII’s flagship, lost in the 
Solent in 1545.

The collection is tipped to fetch £200,000 when it goes under the hammer.

Among the highlights are a pair of 16-inch plates made by London pewterer Edward Cacher worth £15,000.

A pair of octagonal plates made by Sir Thomas could fetch £5,000.

Yorkshire-based Wilkinson’s Auctioneers has been chosen to sell the treasure trove due to its reputation for dealing in pewter.

Auctioneer Sid Wilkinson said: 'The story behind these items is fantastic.

'In 2011 the wreck of a Tudor ship was discovered off Punta Cana, the easternmost point of Hispanionla, an island in the Dominican Republic.

'Divers found, to their amazement, 
hundreds of items of pewter tableware buried within the wreckage and 
incredibly many of them had been perfectly preserved.'

He added: 'They spent the next two years excavating items from the shipwreck and found more than 1,200 items.

'It turned out the ship had been transporting the new Spanish ambassador to the island, which at the time was a Spanish colony.

'The pewter was of the finest quality, much of it made in England, and was destined for his mansion.

'The story goes that when the ship went down, the ambassador was the only one to survive but he had to swim to shore leaving behind his treasures.

'These items are as good if not better than the pewter found in the wreck of the Mary Rose.

'The majority of the pewter will stay in the Dominican Republic but around 200 items have come to us and will be sold in 85 lots.

'Some of the pieces are in remarkable condition given that they’re 500 years old. It is a very significant and exciting find.'

The pewter trove will be sold at Wilkinson’s in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, on November 24.
