Star violinist Nigel Kennedy has claimed children were subjected to sexual abuse at the elite music school he attended in Surrey.

Mr Kennedy has said he knew Marcel Gazelle - the founding music director of the prestigious Yehudi Menuhin School - was a 'repeat offender', amid accusations the deceased pianist abused pupils as young as 10 during the 1960s.

The acclaimed musician, 56, spoke out as a Channel 4 News investigation exposed allegations of sexual abuse and inappropriate behaviour at five of the UK's specialist music schools over a period of 40 years.

'Appalled': Violinist Nigel Kennedy was a student at the prestigious Yehudi Menuhin School during the 1960s, at the time the alleged abuse was taking place

It follows recent revelations of historic 
sexual abuse at the world-renowned Chetham's School of Music in 
Manchester.

Mr Kennedy, who was a 
pupil at the Yehudi Menuhin School during the 1960s, told Channel 4 News he was 'shook up 
and appalled' by the allegations.

Surrey Police confirmed they had been contacted about the allegations.

The Menuhin School was founded in 1963 by Yehudi Menuhin with the help of his friend, pianist Gazelle.

Channel
4 News said they received allegations that Gazelle, who died in 1969 and who performed and 
recorded with Mr Menuhin, sexually abused girls in bedrooms at the 
school.

'I just know that Marcel Gazelle was a repeat offender and it wasn't a one-off thing,' Mr Kennedy told the broadcaster.

'It's
a disgrace really that people's trust has been abused in such a way... 
The children themselves, their trust, the parents' trust, people's 
belief in music as being a pure form of art, [that] this whole ethos can
be abused by one sick selfish person is very, very disturbing.'

Irita Kutchmy, who studied with Gazelle from the age of nine to twelve, told the broadcaster his behaviour had a 'very detrimental' effect on her childhood.

She said: 'I felt he was a very powerful person... I just remember feeling like I was sort of like his property, his pupil and therefore what he said went.

'It didn't appear to me to be weird that he came up to wake us up in the morning. It was just the way it was at the school... He would tickle me under the sheets... His hands were on my bare skin where they shouldn't be.'

The programme has also spoken to two more women who claim Gazelle sexually abused them at the Yehudi Menuhin School.

One of them says she reported his behaviour to the school at the time and was told to avoid being on her own with him.

Marcel Gazelle's family said he was a good man and they were surprised by the allegations, which they dispute.

The Yehudi Menuhin School said it was 'shocked and saddened to learn of the allegations'.

The school told Channel 4 News: 'We have checked the records which survive from 50 years ago and can find nothing about any concerns expressed at the time.

'In accordance with our policies we have reported these serious allegations to Surrey Police.'

Another woman who was a pupil at one of the music schools in the 1990s told the programme her teacher flirted with her frequently, before making a pass at her after a lesson at his home.

She said: 'I can remember it very vividly. The lesson was over, I was leaving. He then shut the blinds in the front room, which I thought - well you know, that's a very odd thing to do - why would he do that?

'And his words were, "I'm going to kick myself if I don't do this" and proceeded to kiss me.'

She said she lost her virginity to her teacher when she was just 17 years old.

Abuse: The Channel 4 investigation follows recent revelations of historic sexual abuse at the world-renowned Chetham's School of Music in Manchester

At least three pupils at the same school say they were sexually involved with the same teacher, Channel 4 News reported.

Abuse: Michael Brewer, a former music director at Chetham's, was labelled a 'predatory sex offender' and jailed for six years in March

The teacher no longer works at the school, though he continues to teach elsewhere, the programme said.

Responding
to details of the programme's investigation, the music schools said the
welfare of their pupils was their overriding priority and that where 
necessary they've contacted the police and the relevant authorities.

The schools said the majority of the allegations were historic, that recent allegations have been dealt with appropriately and that they have confidence in their safeguarding procedures, which they say are under constant review.

The three other schools were not named in the report for legal reasons.

The former music director at prestigious Manchester school Chetham's, Michael Brewer, was labelled 'a predatory sex offender' and was sent to prison for six years earlier this year.

His victims included ex-pupil Frances Andrade, 48, who he groomed for sex from the age of 14 and who went on to take her life at her home in Guildford, Surrey, during his trial.

Surrey Police confirmed they have been contacted by the Yehudi Menuhin School following 'allegations of historic sexual abuse against a member of staff who is now deceased'.

A spokesman said: 'The Force is liaising with the school and would encourage anyone with concerns to contact us.

'Surrey Police treats any allegation of this nature seriously and have officers who are specially trained to support victims of sexual assault.' 

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
