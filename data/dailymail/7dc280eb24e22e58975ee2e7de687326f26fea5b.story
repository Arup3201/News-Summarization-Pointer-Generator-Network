Spider attack: Actress Julie Peasgood was stricken by an infected bite

A cold Sunday morning last December, and I’m up at the crack of dawn. 

My lovely hairdresser Kevin has agreed to come to my home in Surrey at 8am, as I then have to race back to Grimsby for panto rehearsals — I’m an actress and TV presenter and this is my first venture into pantomime.

I am slightly perturbed, however, as I have woken to find a weird, golf-ball sized blister just above my right ankle. 

It doesn’t hurt, but it is quite hot and angry-looking, and I’m mystified as to what it can be. 

At Kevin’s insistence, I call NHS Direct while he’s cutting my hair.

In less than two hours, I am sitting opposite the out-of-hours GP who advises me to not lance it (I so want to). 

He says it looks like a bite or a burn. 

I don’t see how it can be the latter, and although I’m a magnet for mosquitoes, I’ve never had a bite this big before and it is winter.

I try to ignore it, hoping the swelling will disappear as quickly as it came on. 

The following Friday we have our first performance of Sleeping Beauty — I play Azuriel, the Good Fairy.

Unfortunately, the blister has burst overnight and won’t stop weeping — though it is a relief not to have an egg-shaped lump on my ankle any more. 

My legs are on view on stage and the lump had been difficult to disguise. 

My husband, Patrick Pearson, also an actor, renames the show ‘Seeping Beauty’, which I find very funny.

One week later and it’s our Mince Pie Matinee, but I’m not feeling very festive — I’m dosed up with horse-strength antibiotics as the blister has become infected.

I’ve been back and forth to the local GP, where my wound is dressed every other day. 

My nurse, Jackie, tells me she’s seen this before and is convinced it’s the result of a false widow spider bite.

The bite is now a small, yellowy-green, glutinous crater. It’s not painful — just revolting. 

Later, my husband discovers a shiny, black spider in an outside crevice of the cottage in Cleethorpes I’m renting while in the show.

It doesn’t look very threatening as it’s quite small, but it does have long legs and a bulbous body with some strange, creamy-white markings.

I Google ‘false widow spiders’ and it fits the description.

There are seven types of false widow spider in the UK, but the kind associated with bites is the noble false widow (Steatoda nobilis). 

It’s one of a dozen larger species of spider in Britain that can give a nasty bite.

Apparently, noble false widows — about 2 cm wide, including their legs — nest anywhere that’s dark and damp. I think of piles of wood shavings near the cottage, which I trod on in the dark one night.

Stuart Hine, manager of the identification and advisory service at the Natural History Museum and an expert on false widows, says the noble false widow has been increasingly common in the South of England for the past ten years or so.

The spiders were first sighted in Devon in 1879, and were thought to have hitched a ride here on a boat importing bananas — but now they are migrating north from there, possibly due to climate change.

‘Their numbers are increasing, and as a result, more people are reporting bites,’ he says. It’s just a shame one has settled in Cleethorpes.

'I spend the next couple of months keeping my feet up wherever I go,' said Julie

I can’t stop searching for information on false widows. They aren’t aggressive and will only bite if provoked (for example, if you try to prod them or if they are caught in clothing), but the skull-like markings on their bodies are sinister.

Although the noble false widow has been described as Britain’s most venomous spider, a bite will typically only cause a small swelling and numbness — similar in scale to a wasp or bee sting. 

For most people, keeping the bite clean and applying an antihistamine bite cream will help it heal in a few days.

But it’s now nearly three weeks since I was bitten and my leg has gone from bad to worse. 

On Christmas Eve, my friend Lindsay helps me tend to what is now a suppurating ulcer the size of 10 p coin. 

We joke about calling the panto ‘Pus in Boots’, but I’m feeling quite down.

Our final performance is just before New Year. 

My dresser Rosie is also a trained nurse, so she has by turns been zipping me up and applying industrial-sized plasters to my leg. 

She thinks it may not clear up until the spring, so I add ‘rapid healing’ to my New Year’s resolutions.

Back home in Surrey and with the show over, I’m feeling scared. 

I’m on my third course of antibiotics and the thing is still growing. 

Tests have revealed a streptococcal bacterial infection, and my GP seems out of his depth, saying he’s never witnessed this kind of bite.

Stuart Hine says in cases where bites cause a wound that won’t heal it’s most likely a secondary infection with bacteria that’s the problem: ‘Horror stories you hear about large wounds or limbs going black are likely to be down to an infection similar to necrotising fasciitis, where bacterial infection leads to tissue dying off.’

He adds it’s difficult for medics to get a clear picture of how much damage the venom itself can cause. Doctors may not see a bite until it’s already infected.

‘There have been claims that bacteria are injected by the spider along with its venom, but there’s little evidence for this. 

'It’s the same as any scratch or puncture to the skin — there’s a risk of infection and some people’s immune systems don’t shrug it off as easily,’ he says.

My GP is increasingly concerned and we agree I should see a specialist. 

I get a private appointment with Peter Mortimer, professor of dermatological medicine at St George’s Hospital in London, who confirms a false widow spider is the most likely culprit.

The first thing you should do is wash the area thoroughly with soap and water to prevent infection — and don’t scratch, as if you break the skin there’s more chance for bacteria to get in.

Cover bites with a plaster and apply an antihistamine sting cream to calm any inflammation or itching, says Stuart Hine, from the Natural History Museum’s identification and advisory service.

Any redness, pain or swelling should subside after three days. Be alert to potential signs of infection, such as weeping blisters or painful swelling, that continue to get worse after a few days. If this happens, seek advice from your GP.

He recommends compression therapy — an ultra-firm leg bandage to squeeze my leg, encouraging blood flow to and from the area to promote healing.

 I also have to elevate my legs as much as possible.

He warns I’m still looking at a minimum of three months for my (now chronic) ulcer to get better — apparently just above the ankle is the worst area for healing. 

The ulcer also has to be regularly debrided (where they clean out the gunk and dead tissue) at hospital. It’s not as painful as it sounds.

The weeks go by and the ulcer has decreased a little, though I now have to wear a blue surgical boot as I can’t get any other shoes over the bandage. 

It means that filming of my new TV series, Crafty Beggars, is postponed.

I spend the next couple of months keeping my feet up wherever I go.

Finally, at the beginning of March, three months after the bite first appeared, I cast boot and bandages aside. 

The ulcer is shrinking — it no longer weeps, and neither do I. With my leg on the mend at last, we can begin filming.

Dr Dawn Harper, from TV’s Embarrassing Bodies, thinks I got off lightly. 

‘Bacteria in the bite can cause nasty ulceration and I have heard of amputations as a result of false widow spider bites,’ she says.

The only fly, or should I say spider, in the ointment (sorry) is a conspicuous 2cm round brown scar. 

But at least I haven’t been left with a permanent dent in my leg, which Maggie and Jacqui, the specialist nurses in London who applied my bandages, had warned me was a distinct possibility.

All of which means that I’m free to return to panto in Grimsby this year. 

I can say with all honesty I really have been bitten by the panto bug . . .
