A strange second 'moon' orbiting the Earth that has baffled astronomers for the last month, is actually of human origin, scientists said.

The mysterious object known as '2013 QW1' was spotted in August as part of the PanSTARRS asteroid survey in Hawaii and immediately caught the attention of researchers who noticed it is orbiting the Earth and wanted to know its identity.

Scientists at the European Space Agency observing the near Earth object moving in an Earth-centred orbit were keen to find out whether it was natural or artificial.

Scientists came up with various theories to explain the identity of the moving 'dot' shown on a screen (above), ranging from an asteroid caught in a wide orbit around the Earth, to a piece of space debris or even a small second moon.

However, the mystery was solved by staff at the European Space Agency's NEO Coordination Centre, who tracked the object with an Italian telescope with help from researchers at the Observatoire de Paris.

Davide Perna, a member of the team, said that finding the object 'was a bit of a challenge, because the object was moving fast' compared to a typical near Earth object.

The scientists declared the object 'artificial' and think it is very probably part of a booster stage rocket.

It is not the first time that scientists have rediscovered a lost rocket stage close to the edge of the earth's gravitational reach.

When the third stage of the Apollo 12 mission failed to crash on the Moon as planned, it drifted through space and then orbited the Earth, before being rediscovered in 2002.

Its man-made origin was revealed by analysing the light reflected by the rocket body, 
which did not resemble that of an asteroid, but rather revealed the titanium-enriched white paint used at that time for the Apollo rockets.

However, the process to identify 2013 QW1 was trickier.

Dr Perna said: 'Despite the difficulties, 
observations were made with an instrument called DOLORES, for "Device 
Optimised for the LOw RESolution," which allowed us to obtain the 
objectâ€™s spectrum.'

The spectrum bore strong similarities with the spectra of 
previously observed space junk such as discarded rocket stages, 
abandoned boosters or defunct satellite, ESA said.

Detlef Koschny, who is responsible for NEO activities at ESA's Space Situational Awareness programme office, said: 'The observations by European astronomers coordinated by ESA demonstrated a very quick reaction in getting high-quality data that conclusively identified the object as artificial, and hence no threat.'
