Moeen Ali's father has hit out at the abuse directed towards the England all-rounder and labelled it 'disgraceful'.

The Worcestershire cricketer was subjected to booing by some of the Indian support during England's T20 win over them at Edgbaston on Sunday.

A complaint of racially motivated abuse from a member of the public has also led police to classify it as a 'non-crime hate related incident', various reports said.

Upset: Birmingham-born Moeen was booed during T20 clash

Moeen's father Munir believes the booing had racial undertones and insisted the Birmingham-born spinner should not have to contend with any abuse.

'We are very disappointed with what happened. It should have been a special day,' he told ESPNcricinfo.

'Moeen was playing for his country in the city of his birth. It is the city I was born in and the city my mother was born in. The whole family was looking forward to it and we thought he would receive a warm welcome.

'Instead he was abused from the start. He was abused because he is a Muslim and because of his Pakistan heritage. That is disgraceful.

Claim: Moeen's father, Munir, believes the booing had racial undetones

'We have experienced so much kindness and goodwill from all communities - Indian, British and Pakistani - in recent months, so it is disappointing that some supporters let their team down with this behaviour. There is still a problem with racism between Asian communities in the UK.'

The Association of Chief Police Officers defines a hate incident as: 'Any incident, which may or may not constitute a criminal offence, which is perceived by the victim or any other person, as being motivated by prejudice or hate.'

The police would need more evidence to pursue the issue and Ali, who took one for 31 in the game which England won by three runs, does not want to make a complaint, his father added.

West Midlands Police were unavailable for comment when contacted by the Press Association.
