A man has been charged with the murder of a heavily pregnant woman and the killing of her unborn baby girl.

Tony McLernon, 23, has been accused of killing 20-year-old Eystna Blunnie, who was found fatally injured in a street in Harlow, Essex in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

He also faces a charge of child destruction after it emerged that Ms Blunnie was heavily pregnant at the time of her death.

Brutal: The body of pregnant Eystna Blunnie, pictured, was found dying on the side of a road in Harlow

Ms Blunnie from Harlow, Essex, 
was found with severe head and facial injuries on a busy road less than a
quarter of a mile from her family home.

She was taken to Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow at 3am on Wednesday but died of multiple head and facial injuries.

When she died, her profile picture on
Facebook featured a recent ultrasound scan. She told friends she 'could
not wait' to be a mother and added: 'Only 17 days and counting.'

McLernon has been remanded in police custody and will appear before magistrates in Chelmsford on Saturday.

Distraught: People lay flowers on the side of a main road Howard Way, Harlow near to where Eystna Blunnie and her unborn baby were brutally beaten to death

Grief: Two friends console each other beside tributes to the college student who was due to give birth tomorrow

Ms Blunnie’s parents Kevin and Susan described her attack, near to Howard Way, Harlow, in  the early hours of Wednesday morning as ‘horrific’.

They said: ‘We hope that you will 
understand that we have suffered a tragic loss to our family. Our 
daughter and granddaughter have been taken from us in such a tragic and 
horrific way.

‘We can’t begin to explain how we 
feel. Eystna was a wonderful and loving daughter who was looking forward
to the birth of her first child. Sadly this will no longer be.

‘We hope that everyone will understand
the sadness in our hearts and let us mourn our sadness of the passing 
of our loved ones.’

Friends yesterday paid tribute to Miss
Blunnie leaving flowers on a park bench near the patch of grass where 
Miss Blunnie was found.

Tragic: More friends of Eystna Blunnie, lay floral tributes at the scene. They have also written messages of condolence on Facebook

One friend, Chloe Hickman, 20, wrote: ‘It’s a terrible and wicked thing to happen to such a lovely, bubbly girl.

‘Eystna
was such a popular and positive person and was due to be induced at the
weekend. She was really looking forward to becoming a mum.’

Family friend Sally Bugg, 57, said: ‘She was bundle of joy and was so looking forward to being a mum.

‘We saw her during the Jubilee and she
was cuddling her baby bump and smiling from ear to ear. It’s absolutely
heart-breaking what has happened.’

Shocking: A mourner reads some of the touching messages left at the spot where Miss Blunnie was found

One
of Eystna’s close friends Charlotte Bird wrote on Facebook: ‘Hates that
I’m gonna go bed tonight and not sleep a wink but all I will be 
thinking bout are my 2 Beautiful darling Angels tonight who are at peace
and now out of trouble sleep tight princesses.’ 

When Eystna was five months pregnant 
she told friends online she was hoping to give birth to a boy, but the 
brave expectant mother was preparing for life as a single mother.

Describing herself on her profile page Eystna said: ‘I’m 20yrs old 21yrs old this year and going to be a mummy soon can’t wait.'

An Essex Police spokesman said: 
‘Estyna was heavily pregnant at the time of her death. She was due to 
give birth to a baby girl in the next few days.

‘As a result, the man is also being questioned in relation to the death of Estyna’s unborn daughter.’
