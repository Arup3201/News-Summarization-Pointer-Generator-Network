A grieving mother has told how her beautiful daughter was murdered and failed by South Africa's justice system in a chilling echo of the Oscar Pistorious case.

British-born Lauren Sleep, 25, was allegedly strangled by her jealous boyfriend Chad Khan who feared their relationship was about to end.

But her family claim that Khan has evaded arrest for eight years because of his family's status in South Africa and been allowed to disappear.

And like the family of Reeva Steenkamp - who saw Pistorious jailed for just five years for culpable homicide - they fear they will never fully get justice.

Lauren's mother Marilyn said: 'Every time I see a picture of Reeva I am reminded of my Lauren.

'Both girls were always smiling and had a sparkle in their eye.

'Like us, Reeva's family haven't had real justice.

'The similarities in our daughters' deaths are startling and highlight a disturbing acceptance of violence against women in South Africa.

'The judicial system is morally bankrupt and needs to be changed.

'Pistorius received a slap on the wrist and I believe Khan's status and family prevented his arrest.

'In a number of high-profile killings, the ineptness of the police has been challenged through expensive defence strategies.'

Lauren was born in Gloucester but moved to South Africa when she was a baby with her mother Marilyn, now 59, and father David, 62, a mechanical engineer.

When she was 19 she returned to England to live with her aunt in Cheshire where she worked for a finance company and studied accountancy.

She returned to South Africa in 2002 to work as a hostess for a luxury train company in Pretoria and started dating Khan when she was 24.

Marilyn said she met Khan a few times and he seemed charming and polite.

But he had a darker, violent and possessive side to his nature and on the fateful night of January 20 2006 there was an argument.

Lauren had been partying with Khan and her friend, Liesel Schoonwinkel but a row broke out when they returned to the cottage of Khan's influential parents in Hercules, Pretoria.

Khan left, leaving the girls sleeping but at some point returned.

It is alleged he strangled Lauren with a dish cloth before stabbing Liesel in the chest and neck as she slept in the room next door.

Khan then fled and has not been seen since.

Devastated Marilyn and David lacked confidence in the way the police tackled the case and hired private investigator Ettienne Groenewalk to find Khan and bring him to justice.

Mr Groenewalk believed Khan fled to Swaziland, where his father, a wealthy Pretoria politician, had family. The trail then led to Malawi before going cold.

Marilyn said: 'Every time we thought we were getting somewhere in the investigation we would then hit a brick wall. It was such an emotional roller coaster.

'After a few months I couldn't handle it any more and I stopped our private investigation.'

She added: 'The South African police are inept. They never updated us with anything.

'You don't realise how bad the police are until you experience it first-hand.'

Eight years on, Khan is still on the run and Marilyn said: 'To know your daughter has been murdered is one thing.

'To know the killer is still out there walking the streets is another. It makes my blood boil.

'My daughter had been killed. I needed answers and justice for her.'

Lauren's family have set up a Facebook page with photos of Khan in the hope someone will spot him and let them know.

Her mother added: 'Lauren would be 34 this year and should be happily married with kids.

'How many more girls are going to die before something is done? Who is protecting the victims?

'Every time I hear Reeva's name or see pictures of her my heart breaks a little bit more. Lauren was my Reeva.

'I hope that someone out there can help us get justice, so Lauren can finally rest in peace.'

Lauren's mother Marilyn said: 'Every time I see a picture of Reeva (pictured with her killer Oscar Pistorius) I am reminded of my Lauren'

Police in Pretoria said they remain keen to question Chad Khan.

Colonel Vish Naidoo, of the South African Police Service, said: 'The Lauren Sleep case is still open.

'We continue to hunt for Chad Khan but have no active leads at this time.'

Prosecutors in the Pistorius case say they plan to appeal against the lesser conviction of culpable homicide 'on a question of law' - and against the length of the sentence.

As things stand, he could be free to go home in ten months.
