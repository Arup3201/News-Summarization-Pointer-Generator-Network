Firing a giant ash cloud up into the sky and seemingly dispersing surrounding clouds with its powerful force, a dramatic time lapse video shows the moment a giant Mexican volcano explodes into life.

Mexico's second highest peak Popocatépetl erupted on Monday and it blew its top to relieve some of the building pressure within.

The 30 second clip shows how ash poured from the 17,802ft volcano, which is less than 25 miles from the country's capital Mexico City and its 8.8million residents, over a 12 minute period.

Scroll down for video

Calm before the storm: The giant Mexican volcano is pictured moments before a pressure build causes a powerful explosion of ash

Boom: The first plumes of ash are seen coming from the tip of the volcano following the powerful blast

Debris: Rocks are thrown from the top of El Popo and begin to tumble down its slope as the shockwave from the blast first becomes visible

Shockwave: Even the clouds appear to disperse slightly as the volcano almost appears as though it has blown a hole in the sky

The sheer force of the blast is illustrated by a powerful shockwave which can be seen descending the volcano's cone through the video.

As if it has blown a hole in the sky, the clouds surrounding the top of the volcano appear to be sent sprawling by the shockwave.

The blast is the latest in a series of incidents of activity at the volcano since scientists first noticed a rise in seismic activity around Popocatépetl  last year.

Just last month those living in the shadow of the giant volcano, known as El Popo among locals, were put on high alert after scientists detected a dramatic increase in seismic activity.

Aftermath: The time lapse video only lasts 30 seconds but shows the effects of the blast for a full 12 minutes

Huge blast: The shockwave and falling debris can be seen tumbling down the slope of El Popo as the ash cloud gets even bigger 

Active: Smoke continues to billow from the volcano which suffered its last major eruption back in 1947

Danger: Scientists first notice an increase in seismic activity around the volcano last year

It was heard to rumble and seen to spew ash, lava and steam over a period of several days and officials imposed an exclusion zone around its base.

The threat level was raised to Yellow Phase 3 - the fifth rung on a seven-stage warning scale.

Popocatepetl is an Aztec word meaning 'Smoking Mountain'.

EL Popo lay dormant for decades until it began putting out small eruptions of ash almost daily in 1994.

Sleeping giant: It is not the first time it has been feared that El Popo would erupt - last month disaster planners prepared residents living close to the giant for evacuation after it billowed a cloud of ash and was heard to rumble

Lively: Popocatépetl has erupted more than 15 times since the Spanish arrived in the country in 1519

Moderate outbursts from El Popo in recent years have seen officials forced to evacuate residents from their homes.

The millions of people who have settled in and around the Mexican capital mean experts regard Popocatepetl as one of the most potentially destructive volcanoes in the world.

It has erupted more than 15 times since the Spanish arrived in Mexico in 1519 and saw its last major eruption in 1947.

The volcano was first scaled by Diego de Order in 1519 and the 16th century monastries built on its slope are a world heritage site.
