A husband has been found guilty of beating and choking his wife to death on Valentine's Day - just hours before she was to testify against him in a child abuse case.

Jacob Pearman, 32, was convicted of first-degree murder by a jury in Rutherford County, Tennessee on Tuesday morning, a day after closing arguments wrapped up.

Pearman, who had admitted to killing his wife Carla in the early hours of February 14, 2013, will likely spend life in prison when he is sentenced, the Daily News Journal reported.

He was also convicted of child abuse and aggravated assault for kicking and choking his wife's eight-year-old son on December 14, 2012. He was tried on all charges at the same time.

Convicted: Jacob Pearman, pictured in court, has been found guilty of first-degree murder for the beating and choking death of his wife, Carla Pearman, at their Murfreesboro, Tennessee home in 2013

Carla Pearman had been due in court on February 14, 2013 to testify in the child abuse case involving her husband and her son from a previous relationship.

Prosecutors said that her husband killed her because she chose not to testify on his behalf.

After her death, her husband gave a sworn statement to Murfreesboro Police saying he was 'upset about the court date' and had fought with her over what she would testify.

In the hours before her death, he fought with his wife over text messages  and when he returned home, he found his clothes packed, he told the police.

'We continued to talk/argue until 1 a.m.' Jacob Pearman said in the statement. 'We spoke with my mother over speakerphone. At that time I was suicidal, not homicidal.' 

But he turned on Carla, beating and strangling her - before putting her body back in her bed. Afterwards he searched for his gun to take his life and called his parents to tell them what had happened.

Jacob Pearman's mother Donna testified how her son called her husband in the early hours of February 14, 2013. 

Killed: He killed his wife (pictured together) because refused to testify in his favor in his child abuse trial later that day, prosecutors said. He was accused of child abuse after kicking and choking her son

Locked up: After killing her, Pearman (left in his mug shot) put his wife's dead body into their bed

'I remember my husband fell on his knees,' she told the court. 'That's when I called 911.' 

Pearman was picked up at a gas station later that morning. When he was arrested by Manchester Police, he had blood on his shorts, an officer testified. 

Murfreesboro Police found Carla Pearman's body in the couple's bed and an autopsy later revealed that she had been beaten and strangled to death.

'These acts were not only savage and brutal, but they were intentional,' Assistant District Attorney J. Paul Newman said in his closing arguments. 'This was a savage murder and Carla Pearman fought to live. It was a struggle she could not win.'

The jury heard how investigators found Pearman's DNA underneath his wife's fingernails, indicating that there had been a struggle.

Before her death, Carla told her friend Megan Porter that Jacob Pearman had bought a gun and threatened to kill her for not testifying in his favor, Porter testified, WSMV reported. 

Confession: The court was shown a video of Pearman confessing to the killing later that day, pictured

Scene: When he arrived home (pictured)  the night of her death - and the night before his child abuse court case - he found that she had packed his belongings and wanted him to get out

While Pearman's mother testified that Carla had said she wanted to have his children, other friends said that the woman feared for her life and wanted to protect her son.

At the time of her death, Carla Pearman's son had moved to Chattanooga to live with his birth father following the abuse incident in December 2012. 

'I knew exactly what she was going to do,' said her friend Steve Matranga. 'He packed his stuff, removed the remote from the vehicle. Had to get him out of the house. The next day was the court date.' 

But Jacob Pearman's attorney Luke Evans said his client had admitted to killing his wife on Valentine's Day but insisted it was not premeditated.

'He killed her; he did it,' Evans said. 'But truth is Jacob Pearman did not premeditatedly kill his wife.'
