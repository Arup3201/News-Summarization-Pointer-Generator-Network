Romanian police have launched an investigation after a video was posted online showing people laughing and doing nothing to help as a man and a woman drowned in front of them.

The incident this weekend happened when 47-year-old Calin Neagu and his 45-year-old wife Dana tried to cross over the rain-swollen Jiu river in southern Romania.

Local police said that divers recovered the couple's bodies from the water several hours later, and are now investigating their deaths.

Tragic: 47-year-old Calin Neagu (left) and his 45-year-old wife Dana were filmed trying to cross over the rain-swollen Jiu river in southern Romania

Difficulty: As the couple struggled to stay upright in the strong current, people in a nearby boat filmed what was going on in front of them - appearing to find the situation funny

Victims: Local police said that divers recovered the couple's bodies from the water several hours the footage was taken, and are now investigating their deaths. Pictured is Dana Neagu

The video shows Mr and Mrs Neagu trying to cross the swollen Jiu river with their horse and two carts over the weekend.

With the horse clearly struggling to drag the load across the river due to a strong current, a fisherman realised that the pair were getting into difficulty and waded into the water.

Using a stick, he started beating the horse in the hope it would encourage the animal to work harder and reach the river bank before the current swept the group away.

They can clearly be heard laughing and joking with one another as the couple tumble out of the cart into the fast-flowing water.Â

Shortly after, a voice can be heard saying: 'She is drowning man. Haha.' Seven seconds later comes the comment: 'Are they drowned man?'.
