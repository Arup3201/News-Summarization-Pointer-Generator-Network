South Africa captain AB de Villiers believes his side’s 130-run loss to India on Sunday could have far-reaching implications for their World Cup hopes.

Shikhar Dhawan hit a superb century as defending champions India, still unbeaten in the tournament, scored 307 for seven batting first in Melbourne.

In reply, South Africa were out for 177 as Faf du Plessis’s departure for 55 sparked a collapse of seven wickets for 44 runs. And De Villiers admitted South Africa’s morale had taken a massive hit.

‘It’s a big knock for us to get beaten by 130 runs,’ he said. 

‘It’s almost embarrassing. You never want to lose by that amount. Your confidence takes a knock and it’s up to the senior players to make sure that confidence is still there come Friday against the West Indies.

‘I still believe we’ll make the quarter-finals but for now we’ll just have to lick our wounds.’

The West Indies players’ union is in dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board after WICB president Dave Cameron retweeted a fan calling for opener Chris Gayle to be given a ‘retirement package’ after his latest failure against Pakistan. 

Cameron apologised but the union are demanding a ‘full explanation’.
