The husband of New Forest murder victim Pennie Davis, 47 left a heartfelt floral tribute to the mother-of-five as he visited the scene with her children earlier today. 

Pete Davis, who married the victim in May, slowly bent as he laid down flowers at the edge of the police cordon in Beaulieu, Hampshire. Inside he had written the note 'Angel, all my love, always and forever.'

Mr Davis returned to the area, where he discovered his wife's body on Tuesday as police began searching a nearby river in a bid to recover the murder weapon.

Mrs Davis was killed as she tended her horse in a field in the 7,000 acre Beaulieu Estate on Tuesday afternoon 

A specialist search team waded through the River Beaulieu looking for any sign of the murder weapon. 

Police are still trying to identify the identity of the killer who is still at large following Tuesday's frenzied attack.  

Mrs Davis' new husband Pete was teary-eyed as he left a bouquet of flowers by the gate to the field with a poignant message to his wife of just four months.

It read: 'Angel, all my love, always and forever. Your Pete xxx.'

Her five children Sophie, 20, Alex, 19, Georgia, 18, Daniel, 15, and Josef, 13, struggled to hold back tears as they laid their flowers down.

Mrs Davis' daughter Georgia left her mother a teddy bear with a poignant poem by the gate. 

It read: 'Dearest Mum, you were a goddess, an angel, I swear I'll make you proud. I like to think you're sitting there, watching on a cloud. You had so much more to give, you had so much more to do. But now I'll be your legacy, I'll do it all for you.

'You climbed the highest mountains, you walked the longest paths, you'll never be forgotten, forever in our hearts. I love you to the moon and back, Georgia.'

Friends and relatives held each other tightly as they tried to understand what had happened on Tuesday 

Mrs Davis was killed as she tended her horse in a field in the 7,000 acre Beaulieu Estate on Tuesday afternoon.

The Sainsbury's worker, from Blackfield, Hampshire, leased the paddock from a farm opposite and had moved her animals there just four days earlier. 

Mrs Davis' youngest son, Josef, left his mother flowers with a note attached.

He wrote: 'I know I wasn't the easiest child, but you were always there. Sadly you're gone, you'll always be missed. There's a hole in my heart that can't be filled. But never forget, I love you mum. Josef xxx.' 

Dozens of police officers searched a river today for a murder weapon just yards from where she stabbed

A specialist sub-aqua team searched the River Beaulieu in a bid to find the knife used by Mrs Davis' killer 

The officers searched in a straight line ensuring that every inch of the waterway was inspected 

Unfortunately, officers searching the water and nearby fields have yet to find the weapon used by the killer

DS Paul Barton said his team of more than 70 officers are still actively looking for the murder weapon

In the background, the murder probe continued.

Police officers, dressed in orange jumpsuits, have been searching the Beaulieu River, desperately trying to find the murder weapon.

Another 10 officers, dressed in black and wearing purple rubber gloves, walked slowly in a straight line just yards from where the brutal murder took place. 

Detectives investigating Mrs Davis' murder believe she was attacked by or more killers, who then abandoned the weapon nearby.

Officers have today released details of Mrs Davis' car and revealed more than 150 people have called them in a bid to help solve the murder puzzle.

Detective Superintendent Paul Barton said his team of more than 70 officers are still actively looking for the murder weapon. 

DS Barton: 'We believe the weapon used was a bladed item, possibly a knife, and that it would have most likely been discarded close to the scene.

'Our officers have been working round the clock following up on a number of enquiries and I'd like to thank everyone who has contacted us.

'We've had a fantastic response to our appeal and have received more than 150 calls in the last day.'

Teams of officers have been posting appeal posters around the scene in the hope of jogging the memories of drivers and other passersby.

Police today continued their search for the murder weapon or any other clue that could identify the killer

DS Barton said it was 'vital' anyone with information got in touch, ncluding anyone who saw Mrs Davis' green Toyota Land Cruiser on Tuesday.

They are also asked to report anyone behavining suspiciously or running away from the scene.

DS Barton added: 'Pennie's death has come as a shock to many people in the local community and I want to reassure them that we are doing everything we can to investigate her murder.

'As part of our enquiries, we are talking to people in the area to find out more about Pennie and the circumstances leading to her death.

'Understandably, people will have concerns and suspicions, but I would ask you to contact us with any information and please be aware that speculation, particularly on social media, is not always helpful.

'Pennie's death has also been felt across the wider community of horse riders and owners.

'While we can rule nothing out at this stage, there is no evidence of any harm to Sprattley, the horse Pennie was tending to at the time, or any other horses nearby.' 

Mrs Davis was discovered by her new husband Pete who is said to be distraught over his wife's murder 

Speaking at the scene, Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, said Mrs Davis had been stabbed to death

Pennie's friend Nicola Crawford said she knew Pennie for the past five years and used to cut her hair. 

She said: 'Pennie started off as a customer but our friendship blossomed from there after I gave her one of my horses, Spratt, who she still had. She was so bubbly, quite loud, but absolutely lovely - she didn't have a bad bone in her body. Pennie was so full of life and I can't imagine why anyone would want to hurt her.

'She was a single mum for a long time, as long as I've known her, and did everything she could for her kids.

'For a long time she was lonely and her horses were her passion, but when she met Pete through a friend, everything seemed to have finally worked out for her.'

Ms Crawford said Mrs Davis had recently rented the field where she was murdered to keep her horses because it was near her new £185,000 four-bedroom house in Blackfield.

She added: 'Pennie had a tough life but her and Pete were like peas in a pod and spent every possible moment together.He would often go up to meet her at the yard, which is when he would have found her.  

'I just don't get what's happened. Pennie was very independent and would constantly visit the horses to give them hay but never spent hours up there as she was a busy working mum.'

Mrs Davis’s first husband David Colwell, 48, said she was a ‘kind hearted’ woman who loved her horses. ‘I was so shocked when I heard the news,’ the builder from Chichester said. ‘I was married to her years ago when I was in my 20s. It took me many years to get over her. It tore me apart. We split up because I think it just wasn’t what she wanted.’

Darren White, the Sainsbury’s Local store manager in Blackfield where Mrs Davis worked, said his staff had been plunged into a ‘day of sadness’.

Friends said that Pennie Davis, pictured, was a keen horse woman who really enjoyed riding

Mr Pierce said he believed it was a 2002 transit van because of the shape.

'It is all pretty scary,' he added.

Another resident said: 'It's a little strange, they seem to be saying it's murder which is unusual, nothing like that has happened in the 15 years I have lived here.' 

Police and forensics officers were seen at Leygreen Farmhouse, a B&B about a mile from the centre of the village. They searched nearby hedgerows and carried out door-to-door inquiries. 

The proprietor did not wish to comment. 

Village resident Hillary Gibbs said: 'It's horrifying. It's a picturesque village and a tight community. It's come as a dreadful shock.'

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 or the anonymous Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111.
