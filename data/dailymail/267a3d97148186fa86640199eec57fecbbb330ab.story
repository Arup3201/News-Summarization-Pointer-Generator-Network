A 13-year-old boy was tragically killed after stepping on power lines brought down when his momâ€™s car crashed into a utility pole in North Carolina.

Zachary Stoyer was being driven to a basketball game on Saturday afternoon along with five of his friends when the accident occurred on Highway 42 in Bertie County.

A GMC SUV, being driven by his mom, Amber Osborne, ran off the road and hit the pole which then fell to the ground.

Osborne stepped out of the vehicle and felt a shock on her leg, reports WCTI.

She quickly warned everyone else to stay inside the vehicle, but Zachary had already stepped outside and came into contact with power lines.

Troopers say the 13-year-old was shocked and fell face first to the ground. CPR was administered, but he was pronounced dead soon after.

No one else received any significant injuries. An autopsy will determine the official cause of death.

It has not yet been determined yet whether Osborne will face any charges, she was interviewed by police while she was in the hospital.

Troopers say the group were on their way to Stoyer's basketball game at the nearby Hertford County Recreation Center.
