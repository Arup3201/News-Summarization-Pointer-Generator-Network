After keeping a clean sheet during 180 minutes of football against Barcelona this season Malaga goalkeeper Carlos Kameni knows a thing or two about stopping the world’s most expensive forward line.

When Barcelona drew 0-0 at La Rosaleda earlier in the season they failed to muster a shot on target and Leo Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez were frustrated again on Saturday.

‘We knew that Barcelona are very good at getting in behind teams and reaching the byline so we were very aware of trying to send them inside at every opportunity so that they couldn’t hurt us down the wings,’ the goalkeeper  said after his side’s 1-0 victory.

Malaga set up with two banks of four players and left very little space for Barcelona to play between the lines. The tactic proved so effective that at times Luis Enrique’s side resorted to hitting long diagonal balls into the box, which proved meat and drink for the 6ft 1in keeper Kameni.

There was plenty of food for thought for Manuel Pellegrini but Barcelona defender Jordi Alba dismissed the idea his Manchester City team could use the Malaga blueprint on how to beat Barcelona.

He said: ‘Pellegrini was at Malaga before (for three seasons as manager from 2010) and I think they still have some of the habits that he instilled there, but City have very dangerous forward players and I don’t think they will close up at the back the way Malaga did.’
