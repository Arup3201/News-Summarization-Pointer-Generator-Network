After years of inner struggle, Bruce Jenner has made the life-changing decision to become a woman.

And while many in the Kardashian-Jenner clan are slowly getting used to the idea, the former Olympian's his ex-wife Kris still can't believe this is happening.

'Kris is in complete denial about what's going on with Bruce,' a friend told Us Weekly. 'She doesn't talk about it at all and refuses to acknowledge it.'

Support from family: Bruce Jenner (pictured on December 23, 2014) recently came clean with his family about his wish to live life as a woman and after the initial shock they are slowly accepting it

According to the pal, the family matriarch was well aware of Bruce's gender conflict and the two had even discussed it before they announced their separation in late 2013.

'Kris and Bruce talked about this for years. He needed to live his life the way he wanted to, so they split.'

'Bruce is transitioning to a woman,' a source told People. 'He is finally happy, and his family is accepting of what he is doing. He's in such a great space.'

'In denial': Kris Jenner apparently is putting up resistance and is having 'the most difficult time' dealing with Bruce's transition from male to female; she was pictured on January 27 

Bruce, 65, recently came clean with his family, telling them what he was going through.

'Bruce told them everything – where things stood, what his plans were for the future, and what everyone could expect,' the source told People.

'Everyone basically knew what was up, but it was still a shock to hear it outlined so explicitly.'

Kris, 59, is still 'shocked' by Bruce's yearning to become a woman and put up the most resistance.

'It's really a hard adjustment for her,' the source revealed. 'Kris had the most difficult time in the family. She's looking back at their entire marriage, and a lot of things are suddenly making sense. She has a lot to process.'

Rallying around: Bruce's stepchildren, including Kim and Khloe, pictured on January 30, have each processed the news in their own way

Not a huge surprise: The family, including Kourtney, pictured on January 14, 'basically knew what was up'

'They all came all around pretty quickly, but each of them had to process it in their own way. Kim went to Kris and asked her how she felt. They had a very long conversation about it. Once Kim was satisfied that Kris was emotionally okay, she was able to give Bruce her unconditional support.”

Kanye West took the news very well.

'He is totally fine with it,' the source told People. 'He believes in live and let live, and he took it all in stride. He and Kim are just trying to show Bruce love and acceptance – complete acceptance.”

Kourtney's fiancé - and the father of her three children - Scott Disick 'didn’t react very well' when he learned the news, but 'is now on board,' the magazine reported.

'No one feels deceived by Bruce. He was going through this change slowly. It's not like he woke up one day and was like, "Surprise!" He moved through his own feelings and his own changes at his own pace.'

After years of wrestling with those feelings, the source said Bruce is happy and will tell his story when he's ready.

'He's more and more confident. He's doing what makes him happy,' the source said.

Another friend told People: 'He's 65. That's a long time to keep something secret.'

Time has come: Now that his family knows, Bruce is said to be preparing to talk about his life change in a one-to-one interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer

Now comes word that Bruce even has plans to change his name to something more feminine sounding.

'Inside, he has always been Belinda,' a source told Star Magazine. 'He has been planning this transformation for such a long time.'

The father of six is reportedly preparing a one-to-one interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer, which could take place as early as this weekend.

'Bruce will shoot an interview with Diane this weekend to discuss transitioning from male to female,' a source told RadarOnline.

'Bruce realised that there’s no longer any need to wait since the family knows and the public is pretty much aware of what’s going on.'

After months of speculation, Bruce's mother Esther Jenner confirmed his wish to live life as a woman.

'I just learned about [his transition]. Bruce filled me in, and we had a very long, long, long talk about it.

'I have never been more proud of Bruce for who he is, himself as a father, as an Olympian, a wonderful public speaker. He instills enthusiasm in people. He's gifted.'
