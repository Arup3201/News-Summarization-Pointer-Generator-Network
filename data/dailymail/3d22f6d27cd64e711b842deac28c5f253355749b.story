Archaeologists have discovered remains suggesting that cats have lived with humans far longer than was previously thought.

Cats were believed to have been domesticated 4,000 years ago in Egypt but bodies found at a dig at a village in Shaanxi province in central China date back 5,300 years.

Dr Fiona Marshall, of Washington University in St Louis said analysis including radiocarbon dating of bones suggested the cats preyed on rodents that lived on farmed millet.

The team analysed eight bones from at least two cats excavated from the site.

One of the cats had old bones - suggesting it had survived well into old age in the village.

Another was shown to have eaten fewer animals and more millet than
 expected, suggesting it had been fed by the villagers.

Dr Marshall, who studied the site with scientists from Chinese universities,  suggested 
that the cats were domesticated to control the villagers’ rat problem.

The archeologists also found an ancient grain pit, 
with thick walls that rodents had managed to dig through, demonstrating 
the scale of the infestation.

‘Our data suggests that cats were attracted 
to ancient farming villages by small animals, such as rodents that were 
living on the grain that the farmers grew, ate and stored,' she said.

‘Results
 of this study show that the village of Quanhucun was a source of food 
for the cats 5,300 years ago, and the relationship between humans and 
cats was commensal, or advantageous for the cats.

‘Even
 if these cats were not yet domesticated, our evidence  confirms that 
they lived in close proximity to farmers, and that the relationship had 
mutual benefits.’

DNA 
studies suggest that most of the estimated 600million domestic cats 
around the world today are descendants of the near eastern wildcat, 
which still lives in northern Africa and the Middle East.

The discovery has left archaeologists 
puzzling over whether the Chinese cats had been imported from the Middle
 East, or whether they were a completely different breed.

Speaking
 of the latest find, Dr  Marshall said: ‘We do not yet know whether 
these cats came to China from the Near East, whether they interbred with
 Chinese wild cat  species, or even whether cats from China played a 
previously unsuspected role in domestication.’

Cats have lived alongside humans for a very long time, but when and where they were tamed remains a mystery.

Previous evidence suggested they were first domesticated in ancient Egypt, where they were kept some 4,000 years ago.

More recent findings point to a much earlier association with humans, including the discovery of a wild cat buried with a human nearly 10,000 years ago in Cyprus.

Most of the estimated 600 million domestic cats now living around the world are known to be descended most directly from the Near Eastern Wildcat, one of five wildcat sub-species still found in the Old World.
