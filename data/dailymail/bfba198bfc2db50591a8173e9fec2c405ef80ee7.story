Terry and Lyndsay Walker, owners of Metro Salvage and stars of BBC1 Scrappers, have been together for 35 years

The rags-to-riches couple who starred in the BBC1 documentary Scrappers have told of their surprise at the level of attention they have reached after the series aired.

Terry and Lyndsay Walker, who have been together for 35 years after meeting at a school open day aged 11, were scouted for the six-part series after Terry uploaded some funny YouTube videos of staff at their scrap metal empire Metro Salvage.

Friday night saw the final episode in 
the six-part series which charted the ups and downs of the company based in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

After the first show aired, the couple left their home in Radcliffe to spend three weeks soaking up the sun at their townhouse in Murcia, Spain.

On their 
return, they were surprised to discover their new-found fame meant the 
weekly shop at Asda took more than three hours thanks to people wanting 
to stop and chat.

'I'm really surprised about the response - we're just ordinary people in everyday life. It's part of our life, it's normal to us,' says Lyndsay.

'It's been quite a good reaction on Twitter. There's only me that's 
been slated - people saying, "Has she no class drinking red wine with 
ice?", calling my hats and saying she's a gold digger. Yeah right! But I'm not bothered, I know myself.'

Lyndsay says of deciding to do the show, which drew almost three million viewers: 'Terry said it was a bit of 
advertising. But we didn't get paid and it was really hard work.

'It was intense, especially not getting paid for it, and they were stopping us from earning money.

The 49-year-old adds: 'TV people were talking about doing a second one. A lot of people are asking about it.'

Viewers of the show have been fascinated by the ups and downs of the couples enduring relationship, including the many heated arguments about Terry's addiction to spending their money at car auctions.

After meeting at Sharples school almost 40 years ago the couple, both 49, are now married with three children and will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary in October.

Terry says: 'I was at that school for 12 months and then I got whisked away, I ended up in a children's home. But, to be honest, I was thankful for that. When they came to pick me up, I was relieved. I wasn't getting any attention. I was doing things wrong but my parents weren't putting me in my place.

'It ended up where I didn't go to school and was getting in trouble.'

After two years at a children's home in Blackburn, Terry returned to school in year nine and started dating Lyndsay, before leaving at the age of 14 to work in his father's scrap yard.

Terry and Lyndsay married aged 19 and Mrs Walker fell pregnant later that year with daughter Jemma, who is now 29 and works in the accounts department of Metro Salvage.

The pair also have son Jon, aged 23, 
who is car sales manager at Metro Salvage, and daughter Cathy, a mobile 
hairdresser, aged 26. Cathy was born extremely premature at 24 weeks, 
weighing just over 1lb. Doctors said she would not survive, but says 
Lyndsay: 'We never felt that she wouldn't.'

'She
 was in hospital for three months, in the Princess Anne special baby 
unit. Terry always calls her our miracle child,' she adds.

The rags-to-riches couple who starred in the BBC1 documentary Scrappers have told how they met aged just 11 and became childhood sweethearts

Terry started his own business while Lyndsay was pregnant with Jemma after being refused a pay rise at his family firm. The father-to-be bought himself a van and rented yards in Farnworth and Radcliffe before raising Â£250,000 to buy the current site in 1992.

Thanks to years of hard graft that the couple now enjoy a luxurious lifestyle at their five-bedroom detached house in Radcliffe when they are not putting long shifts in at the yard.

Asked if he ever thought he would one day be the boss of the North West's biggest scrap metal yard, employing more than 30 staff, Terry says: 'I always knew - I'm only being truthful.

'I was well-liked and well-known all over the North West. I get on with everybody. But being the boss has its ups and downs.

'I love the job, when the job's good, it's brilliant. But the weather is against us sometimes so it gets you a little bit down.

'Sometimes things don't run just as you'd like them to but that's just because the kids in here are still learning. Hopefully, one day, they'll get what's going on and how I work and once they adhere to that the job will be right.'
