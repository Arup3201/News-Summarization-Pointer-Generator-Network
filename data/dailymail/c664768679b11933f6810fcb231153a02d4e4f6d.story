Three men were caught with a massive cache of lethal weapons after their racket was foiled by a group of inquisitive school children, a court heard.

Darren Alcock, Paul Estridge and Stuart Manners had a huge haul of pistols, stun guns, knuckle dusters and knives in Stockport, Greater Manchester, that were destined to be used in organised crime.

But the men were thwarted when a group of children uncovered a 9mm pistol and 21 rounds of ammunition dumped in a bush and called the police.

Today the trio were jailed for a combined total of 38 years at Manchester Crown Court after being convicted of firearms charges.

Their potentially deadly arsenal, which included mini torches converted into guns, was uncovered by chance on August 3 last year.

The court heard Alcock and Estridge had dumped the weapon in bushes after hearing police sirens behind them.

Their car was pulled over after officers spotted Alcock talking on his mobile phone at the wheel.

The pair were allowed to go, but the weapon they left behind was soon discovered a group of children, who had been playing nearby.

Manners' DNA was found on the weapon and officers later linked it to Alcock and Estridge after examining their phone bills.  

All three were arrested  and when officers searched Manners' home in Sharston, Greater Manchester, they found Taurus Millennium self-loading Pistol containing one 9mm round along with a mini torch which was converted into a firearm with one round of ammunition.

They also recovered a number of shooting targets, 79 rounds of 9mm ammunition, a mobile phone 'stun gun', a knuckle duster, carbon knives and two empty firearm magazines.

As well as the gun the children found 21 rounds of ammunition in the carrier bag in the bush in Stockport

Among the arsenal were a number of mini torches that had been converted into firearms

A second torch which had been converted into a firearm was found in Manners car.

Officers also raided Manners' storage unit in Stockport and found hundreds of small and large calibre bullets as well as a gun cleaning kit and a large hunting knife.

Police believe the weapons were destined to be used in organised crime. 

Alcock, 45, from Liverpool was handed 14 years in prison with a further four years on license after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition.

Estridge, 46, from Liverpool, and Stuart Manners, 46, from Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, were jailed for 12 years for conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition.

A torch that had been converted into a firearm was also found in the car of Stuart Manners

Police said that by removing the weapons they have prevented further crimes from being committed

Speaking after the sentencing hearing Detective Sergeant Mike Cain from Titan, North West Regional Crime unit, said: 'Today's result sends out a strong message to anyone who gets involved with guns - that they can expect to face a lengthy prison sentence.

'The firearms and the ammunition were clearly intended for use in organised crime and would no doubt have led to serious injury or death.

'We are committed to investigating and prosecuting those who use, store or supply guns for criminal purpose.

'By removing these weapons and ammunition we have without doubt prevented further crimes from happening.'
