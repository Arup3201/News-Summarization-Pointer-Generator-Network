The Duchess of Cambridge's winning streak at the Olympics ended tonight as she watched Team GB's women hockey players lose in a tense semi-final.

Kate, wearing a white Team GB polo shirt underneath a navy blazer, joined thousands of sports fans in the hockey stadium as Great Britain tried to reach the Olympic women's final for the first time.

But despite battling hard, the British team lost 2-1 to Argentina to miss out on a chance to compete for the gold medal.

All good things come to an end: Royal luck ran out for the Duchess of Cambridge. Kate was in the Olympic park watching GB's women's hockey team lose to Argentina in the semi-finals

Team GB can still win bronze, however, and will meet New Zealand in a play-off for third place on Friday.

Britain's players would have been hoping that Kate's appearance was a lucky omen as she had witnessed one of the country's greatest Olympic moments the night before.

She sat in the velodrome with Prince William and Prince Harry when Sir Chris Hoy won his sixth gold medal to become Britain's most successful Olympian of all time.

Team GB's women left themselves too much to do after first-half goals from Noel Barrionuevo and Carla Rebecchi gave Argentina an early lead.

Although Alex Danson's late close-range strike set up a grandstand finish it proved to be little consolation.

Great Britain were the better side in the second half as they strived to level the match.

But the South Americans, who are looking to win a golden treble by adding the Olympics to their world and Champions Trophy titles, were just too wily to let a two-goal lead slip.

The Duchess looked on in sympathy and joined crowds in applauding the losing team as they left the field.

Before the Olympics the Duchess made a visit to the Olympic Park in Stratford to meet the team.

Kate had played hockey since junior school and was captain of the first XI at Marlborough College.

She had a run out with the team, after which captain Kate Walsh said: 'Actually she was really good. She told me that she missed playing as part of a team.

'She also told me that she used to hit the penalty corners and you could see that. She got low and her shots were really sweet.'

Later on Twitter the player expressed her excitement at meeting William's wife, adding: 'Think our team have got royal approval!'

Argentina, now in their second Olympic 
final, after Sydney 2000, are looking to improve on the bronze medals 
they won in 2004 and 2008 and face a rematch of the 2010 World Cup final
against Holland.

Before the match, Britain's 
midfielder Anne Panter had said the team was hoping to put recent poor 
results behind them and make it through to the final.

The team had lost in the preliminary stage to Holland.

She
said: 'We absolutely deserve to be in the semi-finals, We are one of 
the top four sides here and are good enough to win gold and that is now 
our next aim.

'We have learned a lot from the Holland defeat and we will come out and play a lot better than that.'

Defending champions Holland booked 
their place in the final by winning a dramatic penalty shoot-out after a
2-2 draw against New Zealand.

The Dutch twice came from behind to force golden goal extra-time but that could not separate the teams.

The match went to a shoot-out, with Holland won 3-1.

Naomi van As, Eva de Goode and Ellen 
Hoog scored for the Dutch with only Stacey Michelsen converting from 
four New Zealand attempts.
