Meditation could help temper the symptoms of ADHD and Alzheimer's scientists say.

A groundbreaking study has revealed that the ancient relaxation technique can switch off areas of the brain associated with a range of psychiatric disorders.

It is now hoped that the findings will shed light on how neurological diseases work and prompt the development of effective treatment.

Meditation could help temper the symptoms of ADHD and Alzhemeimer's according to scientists from Yale University

Past research has shown meditation, which has become increasingly popular over recent years, has helped people quit smoking, cope with cancer, and even prevent psoriasis.

But scientists at Yale University now believe it can help people to stay focused and boost happiness, slowing down the onset of dementia.

Lead researcher Judson Brewer said: 'Meditation's ability to help people 
stay in the moment has been part of philosophical and contemplative 
practices for thousands of years. 

'Conversely, the hallmarks of many forms of mental 
illness is a preoccupation with one's own thoughts, a condition 
meditation seems to affect.

Brain scans revealed that meditators had decreased activity in an area of the brain implicated in a range of neurological disorders

'This gives us some nice cues as to the 
neural mechanisms of how it might be working clinically.'

During the study, detailed in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, both experienced and novice meditators were monitored as they practiced three different meditation techniques.

Brain scans revealed that experienced meditators 
had decreased activity in area called the default mode 
network.

This region of the brain has been implicated in lapses of attention and disorders 
such as anxiety, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, and even 
the build-up of beta amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.

Reduced
 activity was shown regardless of the type meditation and also during 
rest, suggesting that experienced meditators are less susceptible 
diseases such as autism, schizophrenia.

In a similar vein the University
 of Wisconsin is planning a study early next year to investigate the 
neurological effects of meditation and yoga with veterans.

It is thought mindfulness meditation holds promise for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which provokes intrusive thoughts, 
emotional numbness and hypervigilance.

Mindfulness-based
 cognitive therapy (MBCT), which combines meditation with orthodox 
'thought training', is already recommended for depression in Britain and is 
available on the NHS.

A report published by a mental health charity last year argued that if more GPs could offer the 
therapy it would cut the financial burden of 
depression, which costs the UK £7.5 billion a year.
