David Bailey, Cecil Beaton - and lemurs?

They are not known for their photography skills.

But this cheeky group of primates at Twycross Zoo in Warwickshire displayed a surprising enthusiasm when a photographer left her camera in their paddock.

The next David Bailey? Their approach to photography was unusual as they soon took to climbing on the tripod

Eyeballing the state-of-the-art Canon, left on its tripod, the three lemurs leaped from a branch to investigate this unusual toy.

And one of them seemed intense and serious as he directed the camera at his chosen subject. 

However, their approach quickly descended into something more... unusual.

One climbed on top of the camera, before jumping down in a bid to pull off the lens cap.

Eventually one looked like he was going to take a snap - but thought better of it and started swinging around the tripod.  

Fascinated: The group seemed perfectly content twisting the lens of this state-of-the-art Canon camera

Should you be doing that? This one was perhaps too comfortable clawing at the expensive equipment

Lemurs are an old group of primates which evolved in near isolation after Madagascar split away from the African mainland.

They filled the ecological niches occupied by monkeys, the dominant primates, on mainland Africa.

As there was no competition from monkeys on Madagascar, lemurs soon came to dominate its rainforests, until boats started to arrive around 2,000 years ago and human hunters arrived.

Lemur size ranges from the world's smallest primate to - until fairly recently - some of its largest, the sloth lemurs, which rivalled gorillas in size. 

Budding snappers: The animals surveyed the camera ahead of the zoo's annual photography competition

Yesterday's display of photography from this collection of lemurs comes as the zoo prepares for its annual photography competition, which closes at the end of August.

Judges include Bill Oddie, Chris Breen and Alice Roberts.
