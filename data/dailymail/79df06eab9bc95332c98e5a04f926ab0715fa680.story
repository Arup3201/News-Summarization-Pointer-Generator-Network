Hamas paraded more than 2,000 of its armed fighters, drones and truck-mounted rockets through Gaza today to mark its 27th anniversary in the biggest show of force since the end of the Gaza war this summer.

A ceasefire in August halted 50 days of fighting with Israel in which local health officials said more than 2,100 Palestinians, mainly civilians, were killed - while Israel put the number of its dead at 67 soldiers and six civilians.

And at the parade, a senior Hamas leader reaffirmed the Islamist movement's founding charter's pledge to destroy Israel.

Referring to the movement's armed wing, Khalil al-Hayya, said: 'This illusion called Israel will be removed. It will be removed at the hands of the Qassam Brigades.'

In recent years, some Hamas leaders have said they would accept a Palestinian state on land Israel occupied in a 1967 war in return for a long-term truce, but would continue to refuse to recognise its enemy's right to exist.

Abu Ubaida, the brigades' spokesman, added another confrontation with Israel might be inevitable unless the tens of thousands of homes damaged or destroyed in the Gaza Strip in last summer's conflict are rebuilt soon.

Wearing a mask, he said: ''We will accept no less than the rebuilding of everything that was destroyed by the savage Zionist aggression.' 

Palestinians have voiced disappointment over the slow pace of reconstruction and a limited flow of building material into Gaza since international donors pledged more than $5 billion in October.

The elaborate military parade in Gaza City featured hundreds of masked fighters, who marched through the city's main roads holding locally-manufactured and other rifles as well as mortar shells

The burning alive in July of a Palestinian teenager in Jerusalem, a revenge attack for the murder of three Israeli teens in the West Bank, sparked months of unrest

It led to a bloody 50-day summer war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas, in which more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed 

Israel put the number of its dead at 67 soldiers and six civilians. Pictured, home-made rockets are guarded by masked fighters and Palestinians watch the parade

In a similar parade a few days ago, senior Hamas leader Mahmud al-Zahar said: 'Just as we liberated Gaza... we will repeat the experience in the West Bank'

Both Israel and Egypt - which is battling Islamist militants in neighbouring Sinai - are concerned Hamas, which is shunned by the West as a terrorist organisation, could use such material for weaponry.

Israel has said Hamas has been test-firing rockets into the Mediterranean in recent weeks and Gaza residents have reported hearing explosions, according to Reuters.

Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied such tests.

During the war, Hamas's long-range rockets disrupted daily life in Israel's major cities. Most were intercepted by the Iron Dome anti-missile system.

Addressing a crowd of several thousand in the rain, Abaida praised Iran for supplying Hamas with money and weapons. 

Relations with Tehran have been strained by Hamas's hostility toward Iran's closest regional ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 

Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 from Fatah forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. 

Both groups signed a unity deal in April but are divided over how to administer the Gaza Strip. 

Thousands of supporters gathered in the streets Gaza City to mark the 27th anniversary of Hamas, Gaza's de facto rulers, with some watching from rooftops
