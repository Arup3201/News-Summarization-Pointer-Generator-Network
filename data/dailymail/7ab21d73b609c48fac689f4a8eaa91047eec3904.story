 

Lingerie brand Victoria's Secret has come under fire for an 'irresponsible' advert for their new 'push up denim range of bras.

Featuring Angels Behati Prinsloo, Lily Aldridge and the face of the brands new perfume Jasmine Tookes, the ad looks much like the many others released by the brand over the years, with the three  sculpted abs, gazelle like legs and perfect white teeth smiling out at us.

But what has upset many is the wording used across the poster, which states simply 'The Perfect Body'.

The advert features (l-r) Angels Behati Prinsloo, Lily Aldridge and the face of the brands new perfume Jasmine Tookes, with the words 'The perfect body' emblazoned across their taught stomachs 

It is this implication that the nigh un-achievable figures of the models, who often tower over 5ft 10in, is the ultimate shape for women that has prompted outrage. 

So strong in fact is the strength of feeling about the wording of the advert that a petition has been launched urging the lingerie brand to take it down. 

The campaign on change.org was set up by three students Gabriella Kountourides,Laura Ferris and Frances Black, who spotted the advert in a shopping centre in Leeds.

Already having garnered over 1,900 signatures already the campaign has also prompted an avalanche of reaction on Twitter

Calling on Victoria's Secret to 'apologise for, and amend the irresponsible marketing of your new bra range 'Body'' the campaign states that the ad sends out an 'unhealthy and damaging message  about women’s bodies and how they should be judged'.

Already having garnered over 1,900 signatures already the campaign has also prompted an avalanche of reaction on Twitter, with many criticizing the popular brand for the message it is sending through the advert, which is both on its website and at stores across the UK.

In the impassioned but eloquent post on the petition site the three students state:

'Every day women are bombarded with advertisements aimed at making them feel insecure about their bodies, in the hope that they will spend money on products that will supposedly make them happier and more beautiful.

The petition has garnered huge support, with many echoing the message that the advert promotes an unrealistic body image for girls (sometimes by posting photos demonstrating their displeasure on social media) 

'All this does is perpetuate low self-esteem among women who are made to feel that their bodies are inadequate and unattractive because they do not fit into a narrow standard of beauty. It contributes to a culture that encourages serious health problems such as negative body image and eating disorders.

'Victoria’s Secret’s new advertisements play on women's insecurities, and send out a damaging message by positioning the words 'The Perfect Body' across models who have exactly the same, very slim body type.' 

And many of  those choosing to sign the petition are echoing these sentiments in the comment section. 

Hannah Welby writes: 'Body shaming is irresponsible and damaging. As is setting a specific standard of beauty and perfection. As women we need to be encouraged and celebrated in all our appearances and not pigeonholed. For male campaigns this can also be an issue that needs adressing.' 

A previous employee of the brand, Amanda Synder agrees, writing: 'Society needs to change the way they view a woman's appearance. As a former Victoria's Secret employee, I know that the company was developed to design lingerie to make women feel better about themselves. The marketing team apparently didn't get the memo.'

The MailOnline contacted Victoria's Secret for a comment but at the time of publication they had not responded.
