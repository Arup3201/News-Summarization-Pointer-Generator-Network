Mike Phelan has left his role as Norwich first-team coach by mutual consent.

The 52-year-old former City midfielder was among the favourites to become the club's new manager after Neil Adams quit earlier this month.

But the Canaries instead made a surprise appointment by bringing in Alex Neil from Hamilton.
