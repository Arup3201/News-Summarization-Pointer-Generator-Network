It is a far cry from the familiar car adverts of vehicles gliding past dramatic scenery and beautiful couples embracing.

In a commercial for Fiat's new 500L that has struck a chord with mums across the globe, a mother raps about faking orgasms, eating leftover fish fingers and joining a book club as an excuse to drink more wine.

The amusing advert, called In The Motherhood, has proved an internet sensation, going viral on YouTube with more than 2m hits.

Sensation: In the Motherhood, which is a rap on an advert for the new Fiat 500L has had more than 2m hits on YouTube

'I pop a nappy in his butt without a changing mat. CBeebies now my crew and I'm down with Postman Pat.' The parody has struck a chord with mothers all over the country

Actress Rachel Donovan takes on the role of a gangsta rapper -Â  with a twist. Her 'hood' is motherhood, her 'itches' are two dogs and her 'babies' are her three children who have turned her house into a bombshell.

The departure from the traditional way of selling cars came after Fiat held focus groups looking at how it could market its new product to young families, according to The Sunday Times.

Shakespeare actress Donovan created a melody for the chorus and recites lines such as: 'I spent three months in my PJs - it was clearly a sign.

'I joined a book club just so I could drink some wine.'

Other lines include: 'I pop a nappy in his butt without a changing mat. CBeebies now my crew and I'm down with Postman Pat.

'Sleep-deprived and under house arrest think I'd sell both my kidneys just to get some rest.'

The character also describes herself as an 'orgasm faker, nit raker, rattle shaker, cheese grater, night-time waker. I'm a placater. Peacemaker.'

Commenters on YouTube have been impressed with the commercial. One wrote: 'This is sooo catchy! I'm trying to learn all the words to it.'

Another said: 'Haven't seen such a funny advert in a long time.'

The advert didn't initially resonate with everyone, though, including the male board members at Fiat.

'I'm living life larger and by that I mean bigger' is a lyric that will resonate with all mums who've found shifting the baby weight hard

The advert has proved a massive hit but the male board members at Fiat were not sure about the theme at first

Vicki Saunders, a managing director of Krow Communications, which produced the film, said: 'There were a few blank faces around the table and they were brave to take it on because it is risky in places.

'We deliberately wanted to be tongue-in-cheek and for it to connect to British mothers.'

The commercial was given the go-ahead after Fiat UK's managing director showed it to his wife, who roared with laughter.

Elena Bernardelli, Fiat UK's marketing director, said: 'We wanted to connect with our target audience, starting with dynamic young mums, in a way that demonstrated our understanding of the challenges they face balancing motherhood with their desire to keep hold of their pre-children identity.

'We hope by dramatising the reality of embracing a new life stage in this way will raise a knowing smile from mums everywhere.'

Donovan said she was surprised at the popularity of the advert.

'I went to bed on the first night thinking, "Wow, 8,000 people have seen it," and woke up the next day to see it was huge. I've had calls from friends in Australia and New Zealand who have seen it, saying it is hilarious.'
