These dramatic pictures show how a young butcher had an unexpected customer when an elderly driver reversed into the shop - and smashed into the meat counter.

James Moore, 21, who only opened up Norton Village Butchers last week in Norton Canes, West Midlands, looked on in disbelief as a pensioner reversed straight through his front window.

The butcher was left counting the cost of damage to his store and stock after the accident yesterday - but police said the building was structurally safe and the driver, who was in his 70s, apologised.

Mr Moore said: ‘I just saw something out of the corner of my eye and then I thought: “He’s getting a bit close”. Before I knew it, he’s gone through the window and hit the counter, which is the only thing that stopped him.

‘He’s pretty much ended up on my meat counter. He’s was an elderly chap - it’s just one of those things but it has happened just as the business is beginning to take off.

‘I had to run out and turn off the ignition - it was all a quick flash. I think he was reversing, but he seemed to carry on in a horseshoe shape and I think he just slipped and kept going in to the shop.’

The Rover 618 driver was taken to a nearby hospital as a precaution but police said his injuries were not serious. Mr Moore said he was ‘in panic mode’, so his father spoke to the driver.

He added: ‘It was all a quick flash and it was over, but he did apologise. It was lucky there was no-one in the shop, someone could have been seriously hurt or even worse.

‘I don’t know how it happened, he could have been going for the brake, because I think it was an automatic and he maybe hit the accelerator by accident. It hit the door and pushed out the window and then took out the counter.’

Mr Moore, who has worked in butcher shops since he was 16, said he has had to throw away all the meat that was on display in the front of the shop, but vowed to keep the business open.

He added: ‘I have been able to get the door working again, and the window is now boarded up at the front. I have to use one trade counter now instead of the two.

'I have had people coming in saying the business is lovely, I just want to let them know I will still be open as usual. It looks bad having it all boarded up outside, but I’ve got a sign and the blind out to let people know I am still here.’
