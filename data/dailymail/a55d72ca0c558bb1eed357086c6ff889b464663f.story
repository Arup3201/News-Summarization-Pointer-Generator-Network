The two teenage girls gunned down by their retired cop rather were mourned on Friday, as tears were shed over their 'caring and zany' personalities.

Deanna Hochman, 13, her sister Alissa,17, were shot dead in their sleep by Glen Hochman, 52 - who then turned the gun on himself on Saturday.

A service for the two girls was held in their hometown of Harrison, New York. Leading the mourning was their mother, Anamarie DiPietro-Hochman, 50, and their surviving sister, Samantha.

Samantha said in a letter to her sisters; 'This tragedy has broken me. I will never be the same. I will stay strong for mom, reminding her every day that we have two of the most beautiful angels watching over us.'

She also said to her younger sister; 'As an older sister I hope that you idolized me, but the truth is, I idolized you. You were the funniest person I've ever known. You had the ability to make me laugh at any given moment.'

She closed by saying; 'Keep an eye on each other and give pop pop a kiss. I love you.' 

Tears were shed for the two girls as it emerged that Hochman had left a 'final insult' before killing half his family - by allegedly writing the survivors out of his retirement plan.

Sources told the New York Post that Hochman deliberately filed paperwork that did not name them as his beneficiaries - effectively condemning them to a future of poverty.

At the service in Harrison, extended family read prepared from Samantha and her mother, who were too grief-stricken to speak. According to CBS2, all mention of their father was deliberately avoided in the service.

Of Alissa, who volunteered regularly, DiPietro-Hochman said: 'I now see the reason you gave so much.'

According to the Lower Hudson Journal News, she continued: 'Your smile could light up a room and your caring, empathetic way won people over.

'You were the baloney in our sandwich and without you we're weren't complete'.

Samantha, 18, said that she was angry at her sister's death at so young an age. Her statement said: 'I am angry that you won't get a chance to go to prom, spring break, graduation or college. I'm angry that you won't get the chance to get married and have children. I am angry that your beautiful life was cut short'.

Killed: Alissa Hochman, 17, a senior at Harrison High School, and Deanna Hochman, 13, were found dead, along with their father, on Saturday afternoon

Of her youngest daughter, Deanna, she said: 'You had a zany personality to match mine. I love that we could look at each other from across the room and just crack each other up,...'

'I promise you one day that I will laugh again in remembering you. Rest in peace, baby girl. Love, Mommy.'

Samantha added: 'You were the funniest person I've ever known... It sickens me to know I won't get a chance to see you grow, to see you date, to watch you go through high school'.

The Journal News reported that the funeral was held at the Catholic church of St Gregory the Great in Harrison, and was attended by dozens of family members and bus-loads of the girls' classmates, the Harrison Daily Voice reported.

Funeral plans for the girls' father are unclear.  

Of the alleged plan to leave the two survivors penniless, a family friend told the Post: '...He effectively stole the future away from the family he left behind.'

Hochman, who served White Plains for 22 years, executed his daughters, Alissa, 17, and Deanna, 13, along with three family dogs at the family home on Saturday.

Samantha and her mother weren't home at the time. DiPietro-Hochman had reportedly considering a divorce in the previous weeks.

Harrison Police Chief Anthony Marraccini said officers visited the home after receiving reports of no answers at the door.

Police dispatched to the scene made the grim discovery of the bodies and a six-page note penned by Hochman. Police have not said what was in the note.

His body was found in the garage while those of Alissa and Deanna were found on 'the main level' of the house. 

White Plains Police Commissioner David Chong released a statement  and called the deaths 'an unfathomable tragedy'.

Chong said the department were 'shocked and horrified by the news,' according to the Journal News.

'We can only pray for the family,' he said.

'Officer Hochman served this department and the city of White Plains with honor and integrity for over 22 years.'

Last year, Hochman won the department's life-saving award for keeping an unresponsive man alive until paramedics arrived.  

He reportedly suffered an Achilles' injury in early May when he fell while helping a disabled motorist, reports.

He had time off to recover according to his union lawyer, Warren Roth, who had known Hochman for more than 25 years.

He said Hochman sought a disability retirement because of the injury - but had not been depressed over it as he was planning for retirement soon anyway  

'It's just devastating to a lot of people,' Roth said. 

'He was always a quiet, reserved guy, nothing ever seemed to unsettle him. ... And he was wonderful with his daughters, a devoted father. That's the scary part. There was absolutely no seeing this coming.'

In a statement on the Harrison school district's website, Superintendent of Schools Louis N. Wool said Alissa, a high school senior, and Deanna were 'both lost to incomprehensible tragedy.'

He said the response of the district community to past tragedies has been inspiring and that he expects the students and staff will be no less resilient this time.

'In this awful moment, let us remember how proud we are of (the high school community), how much they have helped others and how much they will help others again,' Wool said.

Harrison High School, opened its campus on Sunday for grief counseling.
