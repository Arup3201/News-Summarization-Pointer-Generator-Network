Luis Suarez has said that his biting is an ‘impulse’ which he is getting help to control.

The Barcelona forward has bitten three opponents during his career, most recently Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup.

‘I believe I am on the right path now, dealing with the people who can help me,’ he told the Guardian Weekend magazine. ‘It is like an impulse, like a reaction.

‘Everyone has different ways of defending themselves. In my case, the pressure and tension came out that way. There are other players who react by breaking someone’s leg, or smashing someone’s nose. What happened with Chiellini is seen as worse. I understand why biting is seen so badly.’

And in extracts taken from his upcoming autobiography Crossing The Line: My Story, Suarez  questions the double standards in English football following his second biting incident with Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic.

He said: 'After my 10-match ban in 2013 for biting Branislav Ivanovic, I had questioned the double standards and how the fact that no one actually gets hurt is never taken into consideration. The damage to the player is incomparable with that suffered by a horrendous challenge.

'Sometimes English football takes pride in having the lowest yellow-card count in Europe, but of course it will have if you can take someone’s leg off and still not be booked. When they can say it is the league with the fewest career-threatening tackles, then it will be something to be proud of.

'I know biting appalls a lot of people, but it’s relatively harmless. Or at least it was in the incidents I was involved in. When Ivanovic rolled up his sleeve to show the referee the mark at Anfield, there was virtually nothing there. None of the bites has been like Mike Tyson on Evander Holyfield’s ear. But none of this makes it right.'

Suarez’s four-month man for biting the Italian defender has now ended, but Barcelona manager Luis Enrique is still undecided over whether to throw the Uruguayan straight into the starting line-up against Real Madrid.

'Suarez will get minutes but I can't say how many,' said Enrique. 'This is a great chance for him to incorporate himself in the team. How many minutes he will get I can't say.'

Chiellini became the third victim in Suarez's  career after the controversial striker served previous bans for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal in 2010 and Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in 2013.

Suarez moved to Barcelona from Liverpool for £75million during the summer, and was initially banned from all football-related activity by FIFA.

An appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, however, ruled that last season's Premier League top goalscorer was allowed to train with his new team-mates and play in Barcelona friendlies.

The game against Real will be Suarez's first competitive match since Uruguay's 1-0 defeat against Italy on June 24.

Meanwhile, Real coach Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed that Gareth Bale will miss the game with a buttock injury.
