Mark Clattenburg will return refereeing a Premier League match this weekend after being selected to be in charge of Burnley vs Hull.

Clattenburg had been dropped for last weekend's top flight fixtures after breaking protocol so he could watch an Ed Sheeran concert.

Clattenburg drove home alone after officiating West Brom's home game against Crystal Palace so he could get back to Newcastle to watch Sheeran perform. 

Mark Clattenburg will return to action after breaking strict protocol on travelling to games

Clattenburg had broken another rule by speaking to Palace manager Neil Warnock on the phone in his car

The rules of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited state that officials must travel to and from the ground together to protect their integrity and security.

It also emerged that Clattenburg had broken another rule by speaking to Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock on the phone in his car after the 2-2 draw at The Hawthorns. 

Premier League rules allow referees to speak to managers only when their assistants are present or when given permission, to stop employees speaking to managers in potentially highly-charged circumstances where witnesses may be needed.

UEFA announced that Clattenburg will also officiate Malmo's Champions League home Group A clash with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday night.
