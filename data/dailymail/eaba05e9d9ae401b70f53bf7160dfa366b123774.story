Sitting on board an Olympics 2012 boat, David Cameron appeared casual and relaxed as he watched the RS:X windsurfer medal race with Ben Ainslie, the greatest sailing Olympian of all time yesterday.

But politics were still on his mind as he publicly rebuffed Nick Clegg yesterday 
after the Lib Dems decided to wreck Government plans to slash the number
of MPs and redraw constituency boundaries.

The Prime Minister said he would still hold a vote on the issue despite the betrayal of his Coalition partners – a move designed to humiliate the Lib Dems if they publicly oppose something they have vocally supported in the past.

Tories will now personally target Mr Clegg, who has previously made impassioned pleas supporting boundary changes when he marshalled the legislation through the Commons.

Mr Clegg said in September 2010: ‘To the people we serve it is patently obvious that individuals’ votes should carry the same weight, and if that means reforming the rules for drawing boundaries, that is what we must do. That unfairness is deeply damaging to our democracy.’

The 2010 Lib Dem manifesto also vowed to ‘reduce the number of MPs by 150’, yet the Deputy Prime Minister is now opposing a cut of just 50 MPs to 600. Mr Clegg unveiled the tit-for-tat move on Monday after Tory MPs refused to back his plans for House of Lords reform.

Mr Cameron is under pressure from his backbenchers, who plan to summon him to their influential 1922 Committee next month to explain how he will win a majority at the next election now that the Tories seem unlikely to pick up the gains in seats boundary changes might have delivered.

The Prime Minister made clear that he would not back down and now plans to pile pressure on Lib Dem ministers by arguing that it is fair and sensible that constituency boundaries be redrawn.

The current system is seen as unfair since some seats contain nearly twice as many voters as others, so the Tories tend to need an 11 per cent lead in the opinion polls to win a majority compared with just 3 per cent for Labour.

Mr Clegg’s decision to ditch support for the plans could cost the Tories 20 seats in 2015.

The Deputy Prime Minister wants to see the boundary review abandoned. But Mr Cameron said yesterday: ‘We want the boundary change vote to go ahead. I am going to be saying to every MP, “Look, the House of Commons ought to be smaller, it ought to be less expensive and we ought to have seats that are exactly the same size”.

‘I think everyone should come forward and vote for that proposal because it is a very sensible proposal and it will be put forward.’

The Prime Minister also said he ‘doesn’t accept at all’ claims by Mr Clegg that the Tory party has broken an agreement with its Lib Dem coalition partners.

Senior Tory backbenchers are furious that the Lib Dems have abandoned support and are agitating for Mr Cameron to kick them out of the Cabinet. An influential figure on the backbenches told the Mail that if Lib Dem ministers are not threatened with the sack for defying government policy, Tory ministers would now rebel themselves and the Coalition would collapse into ‘chaos’.

Lib Dem Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne insisted Lords reform and boundary changes were part of the same ‘constitutional package’ and should both be abandoned. He confirmed that he would vote against them.

In fact, the Coalition Agreement linked the referendum on electoral reform to the boundary changes – not, as the Lib Dems claim, to House of Lords reforms.
