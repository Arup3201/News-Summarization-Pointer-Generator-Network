Thursday was 10 years to the day since Arsenal’s Invincibles won the last match in our unbeaten run of 49 games (a 3-1 win at home to Aston Villa). 

That run included the entire 2003-04 Premier League season when we won the title and received a golden trophy.

In my weekly Q&A I described how we did it...

I won the Premier League title in 2003/04... and received a golden trophy afterwards!

Was this your greatest achievement in football? 

Nothing beats being first choice. I wasn’t at that stage but recognised the quality of the group and adapted — I was desperate to be involved. It provided a natural end to my career and I had a testimonial at the end. It couldn’t really get any better!

When did you realise you were on to something special? 

It was special the minute Arsene Wenger arrived at the club. He surrounded us with great players and you knew then that we could go and achieve big things.

I knew we were on to something special as soon as Arsene Wenger arrived... he truly delivered

Who was the most important player during that run? 

It was all about the strength of the group. Of course there were obvious stars — Thierry Henry rescued us on more than one occasion. We tried to get those men into positions to win games, but it was all about the group.

What was the best victory? 

The game against Liverpool when we came from behind to win 4-2. We had gone out of the FA Cup (to Manchester United) and the Champions League (to Chelsea) so the side was quite low, but Henry rescued us with an incredible hat-trick.

But there were several great players who I was lucky to play with

What were Wenger’s tricks? 

He was a very scientific manager and used to give us sugar lumps at half-time for a quick boost. Some people thought it was just to keep us quiet during his team talks!

He also used to not let us have tea or coffee and he banned ketchup, but that caused a bit of a mutiny and we got it back. He even stopped me from having tea and toast the night before a game, which was one of my habits. But I did occasionally sneak a bar of chocolate in.

During that period, how much did you dislike Manchester United?

I vowed never to hate any opponent — that can be dangerous. You don’t play sport to stop others, you play to win for yourself. There are moments in games when you look for revenge but before the game it wasn’t about that.

I vowed never to hate any opponent (even Manchester United), it was too dangerous

Do you think the run will ever be bettered? 

I think it can be. I feel Chelsea could go unbeaten this season and maybe extend that run.

Was it the greatest side of the Premier League era? 

A team unbeaten for a season has to be the best, although there was always a feeling that we should have won the FA Cup and the Champions League.

Diego Costa and Chelsea have every chance of going unbeaten themselves this season
