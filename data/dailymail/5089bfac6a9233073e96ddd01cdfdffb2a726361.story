Graeme Swann was forced to defend himself on Wednesday after his decision to quit last winter’s disastrous Ashes tour was described as ‘criminal’ by former England batting coach Graham Gooch.

The now retired spinner was accused by the Essex great of having made the touring party ‘a laughing stock’ by abruptly retiring after the third Test on the way to a 5-0 series defeat.

Swann suggested that Gooch, who he described as being ‘very old school’ was perhaps not in possession of the full facts about his departure.

The intervention by one of England’s finest opening batsmen means the controversy from Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography has spilled over into a second week.

‘I never spoke to Goochy about it. I’m surprised, I thought he would have talked to me,’ said Swann at an appearance to promote his participation as a driver in next month’s Wales Rally GB.

‘I said at the time I don’t think it’s right and proper to carry on when you are a hindrance to the team. Some people think differently, they think you should just carry on regardless but I don’t and I never will. I am sure I will speak to Goochy at some point.

‘I think he’s a bit misinformed, thinking that I left because of form. Unfortunately I had an injury which meant I couldn’t turn a cricket ball any more.’

The off-spinner admitted that he should never have gone on Ashes tour to Australia in the first place

Swann admitted that he should never have gone to Australia in the first place.

‘In retrospect, I should never have gone on the tour at all. If I have any regrets at all, after The Oval I should have read the signs. But I thought, ‘‘I’ll be fine, Jimmy will take 30 wickets, I’ll only have to hold one end up, and we’ll win a fourth Ashes on the trot’’.’

Swann was reluctant to get into more accusations over what Pietersen has alleged, saying: ‘It’s all about selling books. In a few weeks’ time when all the inevitable interviews are over, nobody will give a monkey’s.’
