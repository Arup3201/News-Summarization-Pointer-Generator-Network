The omnium is renowned for being the most arduous of all the track cycling events - you must be a jack of all trades, as good at a two-lap sprint as a 30km marathon.

And all that pedalling clearly works up quite a thirst - as this Belgian rider demonstrated last night.

Gijs Van Hoecke was so inebriated as he left the Mahiki nightclub in Mayfair in the early hours that he had to be propped up by two friends and carried into the back of a cab to head back to the Olympic Village.

Few too many: The Belgian pursuit cyclist Gijs van Hoecke needs help from two friends as he leaves the Mahiki nightclub in central London early this morning

The 20-year-old from Ghent obviously worked up quite a thirst competing in the six-race omnium event, where he finished 15th overall in an event won by Lasse Norman Hansen of Denmark

The cheeky smile on the 20-year-old's 
face and his bleary eyes told of a good night, though he won't be so 
pleased with the stains from the drinks thrown over him.

The Ghent rider stumbled out of the 
club but clearly had no idea where he was, hanging on to his friends for
dear life with his jeans slipping down his legs.

And there wasn't even that much for 
him to celebrate, having finished 15th in the final standings - imagine 
if he'd won the gold medal.

A source told Mail Online: ‘We have two tables reserved each
night for Team GB athletes to come down and celebrate. Gijs was hanging out
with the Team GB athletes drinking Mahiki Coconut cocktails and our signature
Treasure Chest drink.

'But I think he had a bit too much and had to be propped
up and supported as he left with his teammates.‘

The event was won by the Dane Lasse 
Norman Hansen, with Brit Ed Clancy winning bronze - one of a handful of 
track events we haven't won.

Van Hoecke was said to be drinking Mahiki's Treasure Chest cocktail, which is brandy and peach liqueur shaken with lime and sugar and topped up with Moet champagne

It was going to take more than one bottle of water to bring Van Hoecke round, as his jeans make a bid for freedom

Van Hoecke clearly has a competitive 
streak - he started cycling aged 13 when the football team he played for
started losing once too often.

And he clearly won the top prize for drinking last night, as his friends look comparatively sober.

The 'Golden Sands' cocktail on the 
Mahiki menu might be the most appropriate with the Olympics going on, 
but by the end their 'Lost at Sea' tipple would have been most relevant for Van Hoecke.

But the Belgian certainly wasn't alone in hitting the town last night, with athletes from all countries and sports escaping the routine of the Village to let their hair down.

The British gymnasts Daniel Purvis, Kristian Thomas and Max Whitlock celebrated their bronze medals in the Team Event with a visit to Chinawhite, while the Dutch freestyle swimmer Dion Dreesens seemed to have struck gold.

He was seen getting intimate with a young lady on the steps outside the club, before bouncers told him to head home. But Dreesens was clearly happier where he was, because walking looked a bit of a challenge.

Some of his compatriots were in Mahiki's, dressed in familiar orange colours or Union Jack body suits, but let's hope they didn't carry their teammates all the way back to Stratford.

And the trampolinist Rosannagh MacLennan wasted no time in uncorking a bottle of bubbly to celebrate Canada's first gold of London 2012.

Her precious metal hanging round her neck, MacLennan popped open a jeroboam bottle of Moet & Chandon champagne at the Forman's Fish island Riviera restaurant next to the Olympic Park. 

US swimmer Ryan Lochte shows no signs of slowing down either. Two nights before he was stumbling into a taxi with a number of female friends outside Chinawhite and last night he left the Omega House Swimmers' Night with two more women on his arm.
