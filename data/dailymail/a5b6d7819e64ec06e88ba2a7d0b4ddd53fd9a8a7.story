It was a nail-biting win for the Canterbury Bulldogs overnight but a controversial call may have cost the Parramatta Eels' a shot at making the finals.

With a couple of minutes on the clock, a try from Eels halfback Chris Sandow was disallowed after an 11-year-old ball boy threw the ball straight to Eels winger Vai Toutai for a quick restart, instead of putting the ball on the sideline.

Eels coach Brad Arthur told Triple M's Dead Set Legends that 'an NRL official told the ball boys that they cost Parramatta the game.'

'For the ball boys to be held accountable by a NRL official is an absolute disgrace.'

Dead Set Legends posted a Twitter post on Saturday, tweeting 'a coaching staff member from a NRL club sent us this screenshot from the NRL Handbook about the ball boy duties.'

Ball persons must place and leave the ball on the touchline at the point where the ball crossed the line and next to the touch judge. Ball persons MUST NOT under any circumstances, throw the ball into the field of play or to a player close to the touch line, according to the NRL Handbook.

Ninemsn reports although the decision was, strictly speaking, correct, Arthur said it was wrong that such a big moment in the game should be decided by a ruling he claimed was flawed.

'I don't know how many times I've seen players running down and getting the ball boy to throw it in and it's play-on,' Arthur said.

'Vai actually passed the ball off the sideline. It's a stupid rule.

'What more do they want us to do? Go up into the grandstand and pass it out of the grandstand?'

The NRL have scratched the usual scrum restart after a 40-20 and replaced it with a quick tap in an effort to speed up the game.

In a response to the allegation, Head of Football at the NRL Todd Greenberg confirmed the incident will be investigated, according to Daily Telegraph.

'The kids are absolutely vital to us across so many parts of the game and I’ll make an investigation,' Greenberg told Triple M.

'If I can get to the bottom of who said what, then I will, and I’ll talk to the Parramatta Eels. I’ve already reached out to try and talk to the boy and his family because I think it’s unfair for him to be criticised.'
