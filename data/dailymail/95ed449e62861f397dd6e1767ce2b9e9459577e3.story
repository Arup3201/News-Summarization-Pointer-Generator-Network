The bladders of endangered fish from the Gulf of California reportedly sell for thousands illegally.

A
 Totoaba fish bladder sells between $7,000 and $14,000 - and soup 
containing the organ may go for $25,000 in China, according to a 
Mexicali Digital report.

Totoaba bladders travel to the United States and and eventually reach Asia, the website reported.

According
 to the Smithsonian Institution's website, one totoaba bladder can 
attract a $5,000 payoff in the United States, and more than $10,000 in 
Asia.

Both Mexican drug cartels and US smugglers have transported the fish, according to Fox News Latino.

In
 Mexico, Samuel Gallardo Castro was allegedly murdered in June due to 
an outstanding $1million fish payment, and last year four traffickers 
were busted, Fox said.

Mexican regulators seized illegal totoaba bladders worth an estimated $2.25million in 2013 alone.

In the United States, seven defendants were charged in four separate complaints with unlawful trade in wildlife.

Jason
 Xie, 49, of Sacramento was accused last year of taking delivery of 169 bladders 
on March 30 2013 in a hotel parking lot in Calexico, about 120 miles east of 
San Diego. Xie told investigators he was paid $1,500 to $1,800 for each 
of 100 bladders in February.

Anthony
 Sanchez Bueno, 34, of Imperial was charged with the same crime after 
authorities said he drove the 169 bladders across the downtown Calexico 
border crossing in three coolers. He told investigators he was to be 
paid $700.

Song Zhen, 73, was accused of storing 214 dried totoaba bladders in his Calexico home.

'It's
 aquatic cocaine,' Jay Barlow, a marine mammal expert at the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told the Associated Press. 'With two days of 
fishing, you can buy a new pickup truck.'

An
 International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita report said the
 U.S. must play a role, noting 'thousands of swim bladders are dried and
 smuggled out of Mexico, often through the United States. The remainder 
of the fish is left to rot on the beach.'
