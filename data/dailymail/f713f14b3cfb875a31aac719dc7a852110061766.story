A bus company in Cornwall has confused commuters after attaching a timetable to a lamppost down the road from where passengers can actually get on to the bus.

Bus company First Group said they were forced to put the sign up on a pole 400 yards from the bus stop because it was the closest post they could attach it to.

The rogue timetable has lead to some residents in St Austell, Cornwall, waiting for buses in the wrong spot, with one local claiming a man was clipped by a car while trying to walk to the lamppost.

Passengers in Cornwall have been left confused after a bus company attached a timetable to the lamppost despite the nearest stop being 400 yards up the road

The company says it was unable to attach the timetable closer to the actual bus stop (pictured) because there was no nearby lamppost to attach it to

Locals say passengers have been left waiting for the bus in the wrong spot after the timetable was attached to a post 400 yards away from the actual bus stop 

Local resident Andrew Perrin said: 'It is a death trap to walk there. Some of the buses have refused to stop there because that road is just so bad.'

He added that some buses have even started stopping next to the timetable, further adding to the confusion.

David Edwards of Cornwall Council said: 'The bus stop at Phernyssick Road has not been relocated and is still sited in the same place.

Residents say one man was clipped by a car while trying to walk to this lamppost, and worry that someone might get run over while waiting in the wrong place

'The confusion has been caused because one of the bus companies has added a timetable case to a pole situated further up the road as there is no pole close to the bus stop.

'This has led to some people wrongly regarding this pole as the bus stop.

'We are working with the bus company to address the situation but, in the meantime, would advise passengers to continue to use the genuine bus stop.'
