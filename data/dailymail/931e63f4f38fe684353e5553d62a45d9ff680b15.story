 

A St Louis County police officer working in Ferguson, Missouri in the aftermath of Michael Brown's shooting death has been suspended from duty after disturbing video emerged of him referring to black people as 'little perverts' and President Obama as an illegal immigrant.

Officer Dan Page, who was caught live on CNN News earlier this week pushing the network's anchor Don Lemon and threatening to arrest him, made the hate-filled speech in April of this year during an Oath Keepers of St Louis/St Charles meeting.

His offensive remarks weren't limited to black people - he also had vitriol to spew about Muslims, women who have abortions, gay people and people who suffer domestic violence.

Hate-filled rant: Officer Dan Page spoke for more than an hour at an Oath Keepers meeting in April airing his ignorant views on black people, domestic violence, homosexuals, President Obama and Muslims, among others

Excessive force: CNN's Don Lemon was repeatedly pushed and threatened with arrest by Page during a live cross for the network on Monday 

The raving speech goes on for more than an hour as Page, brandishing a bible, enlightens his audience with his unique views.

Page is the second St Louis county police officer to have been relieved of his duties during the Ferguson protests.

Lieutenant Ray Albers, 46, was caught on camera screaming, 'I will f***ing kill you!' and pointing his rifle at civilians.

An investigation is underway and he has been placed on indefinite unpaid leave.

The incidents have highlighted the racial divide in Ferguson, a largely black town where the police force and local politicians are almost all white. Civil rights activists say Brown's death was the culmination of years of police unfairly targeting blacks.

Protests in Ferguson, Missouri, were muted for a third straight evening on Friday as the National Guard began withdrawing from the St. Louis suburb racked by racial turmoil after a white police officer shot dead an unarmed black teenager.

Hundreds of protesters marched in the hot summer night near the site of the August 9 slaying of 18-year-old Michael Brown, chanting 'Hands up, don't shoot,' while police vehicles observed the demonstration, without intervening.

Clergy volunteers wearing bright orange T-shirts discouraged protesters who wanted to defy police orders to keep moving, while live singing and drums boomed out from a flat-bed truck.

Muted: People march down St. Louis Street to the NOPD First District station to protest the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer on August 22, 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri

Continuing protests: Police reportedly let protesters march unimpeded in Ferguson in further demonstrations which have drawn attention to the police force in the area

The St Louis County Police released a statement saying the Police Chief Jon Belmar was 'disturbed' by the content of Page's speech.

'We hold our officers to a high standard of honor both on and off duty. While we as a department do not have an issue with officers expressing themselves, this was disturbing and unacceptable,' it reads.

'The officer is a 35 year veteran of this department and has been deployed numerous times in military service. He had passed the evaluations upon returning from deployment and there was no indication of this attitude.'

Early in the video, Page tells his audience that the bible is the foundation of the Constitution and that you cannot have one without the other, saying, 'I don’t know what them black little perverts don’t understand down there. But they need me to talk to them. I’ll square them away for you. Take me about a minute.

To the letter: Page brandishes  the bible in his right hand, which he believes is the basis of the Constitution, which he holds in his left

Offensive: Don Lemon described Page's speech as 'wide-ranging inflammatory remarks'

He reads from the Constitution, stumbling over several words, the meanings of which clearly elude him.  

He rages against hate-crime laws, saying there are 'four sodomites on the Supreme Court' and describing himself as being 'into diversity - I kill everybody!'

'And I’m real good with a rifle. My best shot is 1,875 meters, I got me a gold star on that one. You run from me you’re gonna die tired,' he rants.

Page claims to be a Vietnam War Vet and a sergeant major in the U.S. Army who took retirement two years early in 2012 because he didn't want to take orders from President Obama.

He refers to the president as an 'illegal alien' and claims to have flown a plane to Kenya to see where 'my undocumented president lives at.'

Police Chief Jon Belmar says that while Page has never been involved in an 'officer-involved shooting,' his attitude and description of himself as an 'indiscriminate killer' was extremely concerning.

Smiling on the other side of his face: Page has been suspended pending an investigation after the speech was shown to St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar

'I personally believe in Jesus Christ as my lord savior, but I'm also a killer. I’ve killed a lot. And if I need to, I'll kill a whole bunch more,' Page tells the OathKeepers.

'If you don't want to get killed, don't show up in front of me, it's that simple. I have no problem with it. God did not raise me to be a coward,' he said before launching into a rant about the government indoctrinating children to spy on their parents in public schools.

The OathKeepers is an association of former and present military personnel, police officers and first reponders who 'defend the constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.'

Don Lemon, who was repeatedly pushed by Page during a live report from Ferguson Monday, described the video: 'It’s wide-ranging inflammatory remarks about a lot of people, about women, about gay people,' he said.

'[Page] talks about the president of the United States. He speaks out against affirmative action, women in the military and on and on.'

Following his interaction with Page in Ferguson, Lemon told audiences, 'We’re on national television, so imagine what they’re doing to people when you don’t see it on national television, people who don’t have a voice like we do.'

According to St Louis Today, an internal review of Page will begin Monday.
