Weeks after suggesting that women's fat thighs were to blame for his line of yoga pants becoming too sheer, the boss of Lululemon has announced his resignation

He said in a Bloomberg interview about Lululemon's faulty yoga pants: 'Frankly, some women's bodies just don't actually work.'

Mr Wilson, along with his co-founder and wife Shannon Wilson, made the remarks as their company released its Full-On Luon pants, a style which claims to have 'major support and coverage'.

When speaking about how some customers' complained about the pants' fabric pilling, Mr Wilson  continued: 'It’s really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time and how they much they use it.'

In his apology video, Mr Wilson looks earnestly at the camera, seemingly emotional as he expresses his regret. 'I'm sad. I'm really sad. I'm sad for the repercussions of my actions,' he says.

He then takes a deep breath as he appeals to loyal customers to have faith in the company.

'For all of you that have made Lululemon what it is today, I ask you to stay in a conversation that is above the fray,' he says.

'I ask you to prove that the culture that you have built cannot be chipped away. Thank you.'

Following his apology, women's legs got Lululemon in trouble again after a Maryland store posted a poem in its window rhyming 'apple pies' with 'rubbing thighs' in December.

The controversial display in the yoga-wear brand's Bethesda store comes just weeks after the company's founder suggested his customers' ample thighs were responsible for their pants being see-through.

The poem, which reads: 'Cups of Chai/Apple Pies/Rubbing thighs?' was spotted by an outraged onlooker at a store in Bethesda, who then tweeted it, prompting Lululemon to apologize and take it down.

'We're deeply sorry, the display is being taken down. We celebrate that thighs rub together - ours do too,' the company wrote online.
