A shooting at a VIP nightclub in an upscale Seattle suburb left one man dead and hundreds of parties - including reality star Aubrey O'Day and most of the Seattle Seahawks team - diving for cover.

Police say a 19-year-old smuggled a handgun into the Munchbar club in Bellevue, Washington, and opened fire about 1am on Monday - killing a 30-year-old man and shooting a second man in the hand.

The suspect, Ja'mari Jones, is on the run and considered armed and dangerous.

He has already killed once before. Jones was convicted in 2009 of the high-profile, brutal beating death of 'the Tuba Man,' a beloved Seattle street musician. Because he was 16 at the time, he served less than 36 weeks in juvenile detention.

Munchbar was packed with more than 600 people when the shooting began.

Among the attendees were reality TV star and Playboy model Aubrey O'Day, who tweeted: 'Ok. I have never in my life. Supposedly someone was shooting n the club and we had to duck on the floor. Security pulled us out. Wtf?!'

The former Danity Kane girl group singer had tweeted only moments earlier about dancing on tables at a VIP area with Seattle Seahawks players. O'Day was in town to support the San Francisco 49rs in their Sunday night game against the Seahawks.

Wanted: Ja'mari Alexander Alan Jones, 19, is a convicted killer who is being sought in the shooting

'Never been n a situation like that. Every1 was screaming on the floor, we had to crawl out the kitchen. Sea, someone tell me what happened?,' she tweeted.

Several Seahawks players were reportedly in the club at the time celebrating their 42-13 win over the 49ers.

Bellevue, a wealthy town ten miles east of Seattle that has had only one other murder in 2012, is home to many members of the NFL team.

Head Coach Pete Carroll said in a news conference on Monday afternoon that no one associated with the Seahawks was involved in the shooting.

'From what we know, our guys were in a separate area, and nobody was involved at all,' he said. 'A very grave incident, but fortunately the guys that we are with are fine. They're OK. It's too bad. An awful thing that happened.'

Police have not commented on the motive in the murder. They said the murdered man and Jones were seen arguing at the club before the shooting. 

The victim's name was not released and police said they aren't sure whether he was the intended target of the bullets.

They do not know whether the two knew each other.

A second man was shot in the hand and is expected to survive.

'He was not forthcoming with police,' spokeswoman Carla Iafrate told MailOnline.

When the gunfire erupted, the club was a scene of chaos Ms Iafrate said.

'People just scattered and ducked and took cover, whatever they could do,' she said.

Police have been called to the club several times for fights and other disturbances since it opened.

Ms Iafrate said police plan to investigate how the 19-year-old got into the bar and how he managed to sneak a gun inside, as well.
