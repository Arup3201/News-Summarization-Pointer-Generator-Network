The referee who dismissed Cristiano Ronaldo in Real Madrid's draw at Athletic Bilbao last weekend has been suspended amid suggestions he changed his story of the incident.

The Spanish League's Refereeing Technical Committee (CTA) has dropped Miguel Angel Ayza Gamez for a month and he has been barred from officiating Real matches this season.

According to reports in Spain, there is a real danger he could be demoted from the list of La Liga match officials following his poor handling of the game.

Rejected: Cristiano Ronaldo's appeal against his three-match suspension has been denied

Dismissed: Ronaldo was sent off in the 75th minute of the 1-1 draw at San Mames, a damaging result in the context of their La Liga title challenge

Bewildered: The Portuguese could scarcely believe he had been sent off

Ronaldo was sent off for the seventh time in his career in the 75th minute of Sunday's 1-1 draw at San Mames after he raised his hand to Bilbao captain Carlos Gurpegi, who fell to the floor theatrically.

He also confronted Bilbao midfielder Ander Iturraspe during an ugly melee.

Ayza Gamez is understood to have originally stated that he sent Ronaldo off for the incident with Gurpegi but then changed his story to say he had dismissed him for pushing Iturraspe - a fracas the Bilbao player started.

Valencia born referee Ayza Gamez has a reputation in Spain for being consistently poor. 

For the last three seasons he has finished far enough down the refereeing authority's end of season's rankings that he has been a major candidate to be relegated to the second tier. 

He doesn't have the arrogance of several of his even more unpopular colleagues and is liable to be pressured into making mistakes by players rather than erring because of an exaggerated desire to be the focus of every game - but he is seen as incompetent all the same. 

He fell over in the Athletic Bilbao vs Real Madrid game last weekend and that fits his reputation for not being in control.  

He is also criticized for lacking the character needed to officiate in the top flight. 

Madrid have complained previously over his failure to send Dani Alves for dissent in a match where he had booked the full-back but then allowed him to call him 'loco' (crazy) to his face.

Scrap: Ronaldo postures as the players square up to each other

Ronaldo has been banned for three matches and will miss his team's forthcoming fixtures against Villarreal, Getafe and Elche - a major blow in Real's bid to beat rivals Atletico Madrid and Barcelona to the title.

The Portuguese, who turned 29 on Wednesday, was banned for one match for violent conduct and a further two matches for dissent as he walked from the field. He was also fined just under £1,000.

However, the news that Ayza Gamez has been suspended will encourage Real in their appeal against Ronaldo's ban.

The innocent one: Ronaldo stands back as the arguments carry on

Long walk off: Ronaldo leaves the pitch after being shown a straight red card

The Spanish Football Federation's Appeals Committee convenes on Friday to consider their argument.

Ronaldo, the Ballon d'Or winner who has scored 32 goals in 31 matches this season, is still eligible to play in the Copa del Rey and featuring during the midweek 3-0 win over Atletico at the Bernabeu.

He will also be able to play in next week's second leg.

Wow! What a remarkable decision by the Spanish Refereeing Technical Committee.

I wouldn’t like to be the next referee who officiates in a Real Madrid game.

This is all about Madrid. The fact Miguel Angel Ayza Gamez has been given a one month suspension and told he cannot referee any more Madrid games indicates the power and influence they have.

It may have been a harsh red, but we have seen those before.

The chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee is Spanish too, so he will be taking an interest in this.

It also comes out the day Cristiano Ronaldo has his appeal hearing, which suggest he will be treated with leniency.
