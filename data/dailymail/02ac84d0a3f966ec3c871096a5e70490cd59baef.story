An Islamic centre was burned to the ground in a suspected arson attack yesterday.

Counter-terrorism police are investigating if the building was targeted by the English Defence League in retaliation for the Woolwich murder, after ‘EDL’ was sprayed in foot-high letters on the wall.

The far-Right group led a series of protests after serving soldier Lee Rigby was killed by two fanatical Muslim converts last month, and there has been a dramatic rise in the number of reported attacks on mosques since the outrage.

EDL leaders denied the group was 
behind the fire in Muswell Hill, north London, but supporters posted 
vile celebrations online, prompting fears of copycat attacks and 
increased racial tensions.

Flames ripped through the empty brick 
building, which was home to a Somali welfare association  and an 
after-school club, shortly after 3am.

The ferocity of the blaze suggested 
that an accelerant such as petrol was used to fuel it. Two neighbouring 
properties were evacuated and a woman was treated for minor injuries and
 shock.

It is believed that one or more 
arsonists may have suffered serious injuries and hospitals have been 
asked to alert police about burns patients admitted in the hours after 
the attack.

Appealing for calm, community leaders said the centre was not a mosque and had no links to the Woolwich murder suspects.

But they revealed it was targeted by 
vandals after the July 7 London bombings in 2005, and again two years 
ago, and said they believed the arson was a racist attack.

Young Muslims accused the far Right of ‘trying to start a war’ and warned of possible retaliatory attacks.

The EDL denied responsibility. Leader Tommy Robinson said he would report any member found to be responsible.

He said: ‘They have put innocent 
people’s lives in danger. It’s disgusting. I’ve asked our members never 
to attack mosques or Muslims.’

Mr Robinson, whose real name is 
Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, claimed there was a nationwide campaign to smear 
the group by linking it to firebomb attacks.

Ahmed Mohamed, a volunteer at the 
family-run centre, said he had seen the graffiti on the outside of the 
building after he was alerted about the fire. ‘The letters EDL were 
sprayed in a dark colour, about a foot high,’ he said.

Another volunteer claimed more graffiti was spotted inside the building, a former Scout hall, before it collapsed.

Chief Superintendent Adrian Usher said police had found no evidence that a bomb or explosive device was used to start the fire.

Resident Abdul Safer, 40, said the community was worried about security after the attack.

He said: ‘Of course we are  worried. 
Anyone with children would be. It is nothing to do with religion – there
 are people on both sides who are using the name of religion for 
violence, but it is just madness.’

Local Tory MP Theresa Villiers said: 
‘This does look to be a hate crime and I think it’s utterly disgusting. 
If it has a goal it will not achieve it. Attacks like this are designed 
to divide communities. I’m certain this will not happen in our 
community.’

Meanwhile the Bomber Command memorial in Green Park has been defaced with graffiti for the second time in weeks.

In the aftermath of the Woolwich 
murder the word ‘Islam’ was sprayed on it, and yesterday  workers were 
attempting to remove the slogan ‘Lee Rigby killers shud [sic] hang’.

Jim Dooley, who led the fundraising effort for the monument, said veterans would be ‘disgusted’ by the vandalism.

He said: ‘The freedom that the heroes 
of Bomber Command secured included freedom of speech. It is terrible 
that this monument is being defaced in a warped mutation of that.

‘The memorial is nothing to do with the current tensions but whoever is vandalising it is too mindless to realise that.’

A war memorial that was attacked by vandals in central London last week has been targeted for a second time.

The RAF Bomber Command War Memorial in Green Park has 'once again been subjected to vandalism', the RAF Benevolent Fund said.

A blog post on the fund's website said: 'We are extremely disappointed and saddened that the Bomber Command Memorial has once again been subjected to vandalism.

Attack: Police deal with the latest lot of graffiti to be daubed on the Bomber Command Memorial in central London

'Work is currently under way to remove the graffiti.'

The post by Air Marshal Chris Nickols, controller, RAF Benevolent Fund, continued: 'The RAF Benevolent Fund exists to provide welfare for past and present RAF personnel and their dependants who are in need; this latest attack will once again divert much needed resources away from our primary purpose.'

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: “At 4.43 this morning officers came across graffiti on the Bomber Command War Memorial in Green Park.”

Although the spokesman would not confirm what the graffiti said, it is not thought to be of a similar nature to the graffiti daubed on the memorial last week.

The RAF Bomber Command War Memorial - and the Animals in War Memorial on Park Lane - were daubed with graffiti on May 27.

Although the words written on the two memorials were covered up quickly after police made the discovery at around 5am, it is thought 'Islam' was written on each of them.

The Bomber Command Memorial remembers the sacrifice and bravery of the 55,573 RAF crew who lost their lives in the Second World War and was unveiled by the Queen last summer.

A couple of weeks ago Dame Judi Dench described herself as being “very proud” to be the first patron of a new campaign to preserve it for generations to come.
