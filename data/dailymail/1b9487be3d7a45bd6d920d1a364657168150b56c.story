As if Hollywood hasn't had enough leaks of late.

For a short time on Friday night, the official website of Sunday's Golden Globe Awards posted what appeared to be this year's winners in two top Globes categories, setting off some momentary excitement in the industry trade press.

Selma and Into The Woods were named as the two top winners for the 72nd annual Golden Globes, which are set for Sunday night.

Whoops?! This grab of the Golden Globes website from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association shows the captions reveal Selma and Into the Woods are winners, while keeping pictures of last year's winners, 12 Years a Slave and American Hustle

The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which runs the annual awards, referred all inquiries to its site administrator, Bluefin.

'While testing the official website of the Golden Globe Awards for Sunday's ceremony, Bluefin inadvertently took the test live,' said a company statement. 

'We randomly selected two film titles with no knowledge of the category winners. We are solely responsible for the error.'

The apparent inadvertent reveal named Selma, the historical drama about Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement, as the winner of the outstanding motion picture in the drama category.

Front runner: Selma, which documents the work of Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement is a favorite for Oscar's glory 

Stars: Meryl Streep is one of the stars of Into the Woods, which also features new Late Late Show host James Corden

Fantasy drama, Into the Woods, which stars upcoming Late Late Show host James Corden, was named as the best motion picture, musical or comedy.

The apparent mistake was revealed when visitors to the Golden Globes website saw images of last year's winners, 12 Years a Slave and American Hustle with captions for Into the Woods and Selma.

However, not too much should be read into the error.

In 2009, Anne Hathaway was named on the HFPA website as the winner in the actress category for Rachel Getting Married, but ultimately, Kate Winslet won and not Hathaway.
