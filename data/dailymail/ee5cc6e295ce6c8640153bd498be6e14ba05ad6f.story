A mother with a passion for motoring has named her newest arrival Porsche after the baby was born at top speed in the middle of a supermarket.

Car fan Joy Lowther, 28, from Kings Lynn, had popped into Tesco with her oldest daughter Mercedes, three, when she suddenly went into labour in the baby aisle.

She was helped into a store room where concerned staff helped her deliver her healthy 6lb 7oz baby girl in just 10 minutes.

Joy was then rushed to hospital where she was joined by her partner Kevin Smith, 26, and their eight year-old son, Alfie, who has now been rechristened Alfa.

New daughter Porsche (pronounced Porsha) wasn't due to put in an appearance for another four weeks when Joy went into labour a week ago.

Although Joy has always loved cars, she chooses not to drive leaving chauffeuring duties to Kevin, currently unemployed, who has a 'passion' for them and
 currently drives an M sport 5 series BMW.

The young mother, who has another son named Frank, six, says she thinks car names are 'beautiful', is now planning one more baby - who will be called Bentley if he’s a boy.

'When I went to the baby aisle in Tesco, I didn't think it would be to have a baby,' revealed a delighted Joy.

'The supervisor in the store was the one who delivered the baby but all the staff were great. Because I had Mercedes I had always planned to call the next one Porsche.

'Then she arrived so quickly, so Porsche was quite fitting.'

The stay-at-home mother added: 'My son is called Alfie, but because the girls are named after cars we all refer to him as Alfa.

'Like any new mum the kids are driving me up the wall. But it’s fantastic having them all.'

Tesco branch manager Cheryl Moir, 40, who helped deliver Porsche, said: 'It was really, really special to be involved in such an amazing experience.

'To be part of that process was a real privilege. You don’t stop to think, instinct just cuts in.'
