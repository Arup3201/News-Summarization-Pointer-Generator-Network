This is the horrifying moment a father accidentally shot a firework into a trampoline where his daughter was playing.

Peter Watson, 40, of Middlesbrough on Teesside, looked on in horror as the rocket fired directly into the enclosed trampoline - turning a playful bouncing session into a scene of sheer panic.

CCTV footage captured sparks spraying around the netting as Mr Watson's daughter Kacey, nine, and a family friend's brother, ten, desperately try to escape.

Panic: One child cowers on the side of the trampoline while Peter Watson's daughter Kacey becomes obscured from view by the intense explosion of sparks

Taxi driver Mr Watson said: 'I was in total shock, I just immediately ran over to check that they were both okay, I couldn't believe what had happened.

'Luckily, nobody got hurt, but it was certainly a fright, fireworks can be very dangerous even if they are set off correctly.

'We were very lucky, the children could have suffered some very nasty burns.

'Someone was looking down on us all that night and I won't be doing any more fireworks any time soon.'

Calm: The two children are seen happily bouncing on the trampoline in CCTV footage before disaster strikes

After attending an organised fireworks display locally, the Watson family had continued the party back at their home, buying £50 worth of rockets.

Mr Watson's other daughter, Sam, 21, a health carer, said: 'We were all in the garden. My dad and my friend's boyfriend set up the fireworks outside of the front gate and on a grassy area nearby.

'My dad put the kids on the trampoline, as it's the well away from the house and what he thought would be the safest place.

'The rocket that went wrong was the last one, my dad lit it and we all watched as it flew off the wrong way, then bounced off the wall of our house and landed onto the trampoline.

'Kacey and the other boy who were playing on the trampoline tried to run and get off but Kacey fell and got her leg stuck in the netting. Luckily they both managed to get out without getting burnt.

'It was very scary as all the kids were in the garden and we had no idea where the firework would land.

'Kacey was shaking and very scared during the whole night but she's fine now, I don't think she'll feel the same around fireworks in the future though.'

Mr Watson, who suffered a serious injury to his hands 15 years ago in another firework-based accident, thinks people should learn from his mistakes and take more care with fireworks in general.

He added: 'Please don't buy any fireworks online or from Facebook. Only buy them from a shop who has a licence to sell them.'

'Yes, the whole incident has put me off fireworks for a while. Next year, I'm not even going to buy a pack of sparklers.'

Mr Watson has stressed that he had lit the firework according to the instructions on the packet and that it flew off in the wrong direction.

He added: 'I did everything I was supposed to do. The firework was pointing away from the house when I lit it, but it shot off in the wrong direction.

'It hit the side of the house and bounced into the trampoline.'I don't want to be portrayed as an irresponsible father because that is simply not the case.'
