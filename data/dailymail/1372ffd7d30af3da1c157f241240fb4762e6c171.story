In court: Thomas Ammann, 39, allegedly handed over price sensitive details about a takeover between photocopying firms involving Canon

A love-cheat investment banker helped 
his two girlfriends make more than £2million by leaking insider 
information, a court heard yesterday.

Thomas Ammann, 39, handed over the 
confidential details about a future City takeover bid to Christina 
Weckwerth and Jessica Mang, it was claimed.

The two women allegedly used the 
sensitive insider information to ‘almost double their money’ by buying 
and selling shares in one company.

Ammann, who worked at the London 
offices of Japanese bank Mizuho, was one of only seven at the bank who 
knew that global electronics company Canon was planning a takeover of 
Dutch printing firm Oce.

The German banker allegedly shared 
this sensitive information with his two lovers – who had no knowledge 
of  each other – months before the deal became public. Weckwerth, 44, 
made nearly £2million while Mang, 29, pocketed £60,000 from their 
illicit trading, it was claimed.

Prosecutor Amanda Pinto QC told 
Southwark Crown Court yesterday that Ammann pleaded guilty to two counts
of encouraging insider dealing and two counts of insider dealing 
earlier this year.

She said: ‘In broad terms these  two women managed to almost  double their money by trading in just one stock.

‘Each of these women considered that Thomas Ammann was their boyfriend and they had no idea of the existence of the other.’

The court heard that on March 12, 
2009, Canon sent a confidential letter expressing its interest in a 
takeover of Oce to a select group who were working on the deal, 
including Ammann. The next day Weckwerth bought 14,500 shares in Oce, it
was alleged.

Three days later, after a weekend with Ammann, she bought another 20,000 shares, the jury heard.

The prosecutor added: ‘Thomas Ammann 
and Christina Weckwerth sent several texts and had very long phone calls
on the evening of March 12. The following day, after another call, she 
invested in those shares.’

And in April 2009 Weckwerth approached
the Bank of Cyprus with a view to setting up her own company to handle 
her share trades, it was said. She hired a team of staff and made an 
initial £320,000 investment from her share dealing.

Lovers: Southwark Crown Court heard that neither women knew of each other's existence and both considered Ammann to be their boyfriend

Mang is said to have illegally traded in Oce shares via a Halifax account.

Weckwerth, of Koenigstein im Taunus, 
Germany, denies one count of insider dealing between April and November 
2009. Mang, of Westminster, also denies one count of insider dealing in 
November 2009.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
