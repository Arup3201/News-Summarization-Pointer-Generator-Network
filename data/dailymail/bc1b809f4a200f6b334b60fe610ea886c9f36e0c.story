It is often said that your name says a lot about you and it's probably true that people make assumptions about others based on them.

So how would you feel knowing that your harder-to-pronounce name may affect your credibility?

According to a new study the pronounceability of people’s names can influence how much we believe them when evaluating their claims.

Credible actress: Actress Lupita Nyong'o poses with her Oscar earlier this year. Scientists say that harder-to-pronounce names make people less trustworthy

Mexican-Kenyan Luipita Nyong'o has said people often struggle to pronounce her name, but whether they believe her or not, it's not affected her outstanding career

The study by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, and Kwantlen Polytechnic University in Canada, asked undergraduate volunteers to rate the pronounceability of real 
names from 18 countries across the word.

Based
 on these results, the team leading the research then made up their own 
set of difficult-to-pronounce-names, such as Yevgeni Dherzhinsky and 
Shobha Bhattacharya, and a set of ‘easy’ names, such as Putali Angami 
and Bodo Wallmeyer.

The undergraduate participants were then 
given some straightforward trivia statements, such as ‘Giraffes are the 
only mammals that cannot jump,’ each credited to one of the names that 
they researchers had devised. The students then had to say whether or 
not they thought the statements were true.

The aim, according to Scientific American who reported the results, was to see if the names had any 
influence over the believability of the statements. In their words: ‘To 
what extent are our evaluations of people’s credibility swayed by how 
easily we can pronounce their names?’

Would you trust Emily Ratajkowski? According to a new study, harder-to-pronounce names make the person less believable

Does your name affect your credibility? A study says yes, but model Emily Ratajkowski, pictured here, certainly hasn't seemed to have let that get in the way of her runway success

They predicted that those with ‘easier’ names would appear more credible.

And their predictions proved correct.

The results confirmed that a greater number of 
statements paired with easy names resulted in a greater number of ‘true’
 responses.

If the findings are to be believed, what does that mean for popular celebrities whose names aren’t quite so easy to pronounce?

Stunning model, Emily Ratajkowsk, above, who 
shot to fame in Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines video last year and is has a
 role in next year’s Fifty Shades of Grey, has just been voted fourth 
Sexiest Woman in the World by FHM magazine.

'Tis but a name: Actors Chiwetel Ejiofor and Nikolaj Coster-Walda, right, might not be the easiest names to pronounce, but does that make them less credible?

Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Walda stars in the hot show Game of Thrones as Jaime Lannister. His name certainly hasn't held back his career, but would you trust him?

She’s of British descent and was raised in the US, and it seems her tricky to say surname hasn't set her back so far.

This year’s Academy Awards saw rising star Lupita Nyong'o win Best Supporting Actress and

Chiwetel Ejiofor nominated for Best Actor. Game of Thrones heart throb Nikolaj Coster-Waldau hasn’t done too badly off his Danish name, either.

He starred in thriller Headhunters and is currently playing the leading ladies man in The Other Woman, charming Leslie Mann, Kate Upton and Cameron Diaz in the film.

Maybe complicated names aren’t so bad after all.
