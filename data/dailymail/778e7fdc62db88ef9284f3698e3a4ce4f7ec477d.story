Train travellers are not being told about their right to compensation – despite as many as four in ten suffering a delay on their last journey.

Passengers held up for more than an hour are entitled to a full refund. But up to eight in ten put through the misery of a long delay are not given this information, research by Which? found.

The poll of 7,300 travellers paints a picture of unreliable and dirty trains, particularly on commuter routes into London. Others heading to Gatwick and Luton airports, where punctuality is vital to making flights, are also being let down.

The consumer group rated train companies for their reliability, punctuality, value for money and cleanliness to come up with an overall score for customer satisfaction. Its findings come at a time when customers are being hit with punishing ticket price rises – which have risen well above inflation.

Thameslink & Great Northern, which operates services from the Home Counties into London, came out worst in the country with an overall customer satisfaction score of 43 per cent. It scored badly on cleanliness, punctuality and availability of seating.

Southeastern, which also runs services through Kent and Sussex into the capital, did little better with a score of 44 per cent. Third worst was Southern, with a satisfaction score of just 46 per cent.

Which? said: ‘Southern was the worst for delays with four in ten saying they were held up the last time they travelled.’

The company was recently shamed after it emerged that its 7.29am Brighton to London Victoria service failed to arrive on time once in 2014. 

A survey found that 33 per cent of customers for South West Trains were told about their right to a full refund

But despite Southern’s appalling record on punctuality, the survey found that just two in ten customers delayed for an hour were told about their right to a full refund.

And many other companies were not much better – the figure was 27 per cent for First Great Western, 31 per cent for Southeastern, 33 per cent for South West Trains, and 38 per cent for London Overground.

Most train companies are signed up to the Delay Repay scheme, where travellers delayed for 30-59 minutes can claim back 50 per cent of the cost of a single journey.

A delay of 60-119 minutes allows a refund of 100 per cent of the cost of a single journey, while delays beyond this qualify for the cost of two single journeys. These refunds are usually paid in vouchers, rather than cash.

Which? said: ‘Passengers often have little or no choice as to the rail companies they travel with, so as ticket prices continue to rocket, more must be done to improve customers’ satisfaction and to inform people of their right to a refund as a result of delays.’

As many as four in 10 passengers suffered a delay on their last journey. Passengers held up for more than an hour are entitled to a full refund

Grand Central – which operates in the North East through to London – came top of the customer satisfaction table with a score of 76 per cent. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail operators, said billions were being spent to help ‘improve passenger satisfaction’. It added that nine out of ten trains arrive on time, and that ‘compensation is increasingly generous and easy to apply for’.

Thameslink said it was ‘determined to make things better’ and it knew ‘these scores are not good enough’.

Southern added: ‘We know that because of performance problems, our service has been below levels expected.’

Southeastern said it was investing £70million over the next three years to help ‘provide better information to passengers’ and improve conditions.
