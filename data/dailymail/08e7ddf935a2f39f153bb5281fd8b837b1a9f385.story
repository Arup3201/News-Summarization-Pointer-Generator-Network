Police have been granted an extension to continue questioning the parents of six children who died in a horrific house fire.

Mick and Mairead Philpott were arrested yesterday on suspicion of their murder and police were allowed to detain them until 10am this morning before applying for extra time. 

Their arrest came a week after police seized a caravan and minibus parked outside their home for forensic tests.

Grief-stricken: Mick and Mairead Philpott, the parents of six children who died following a fire at their home in Derby, appeared at a news conference

The couple had broken down in tears at a
press conference a fortnight ago as police officers described the 
attack that claimed the lives of their children.

Jade Philpott, ten, and brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five, were all killed in the fire. Older brother Duwayne, 13, died of his injuries in hospital a few days later with his parents at his bedside.

Mr Philpott had been hailed by neighbours as a hero for ‘valiant’ attempts to rescue his children. Police have established that the fire was deliberate, caused by someone pouring petrol through the letterbox of the family’s three-bedroom council house in Allenton, Derby, before igniting it with a match or a cigarette lighter.

While Mr Philpott, 55, and wife Mairead, 31, had previously been questioned as witnesses, officers said they were not ruling anybody out as the potential arsonists.

After the parents were arrested yesterday, Derbyshire assistant chief constable Steve Cotterill appealed for the local community to help officers work out why the fire was started.

He said: ‘In view of the arrests, I would urge anyone who may have been holding back, not felt comfortable to voice their concerns or not had the confidence, to do so now.

‘It may well be that you have a little bit of loyalty to family  or friends. I would ask you to  put that aside in memory of those six children.’

Mr and Mrs Philpott were arrested yesterday morning in Derby. Police are able to question them until 10am today, but may seek an extension if necessary to interview them further.

The couple are believed to have been at home when the fire broke out in the early hours of May 11, but some neighbours have said they were out. Mr and Mrs Philpott have previously insisted they were woken by a smoke alarm and failed to save the children despite ‘valiant’ attempts.

The caravan removed by police from outside the property last week is thought to have been used as extra accommodation at the family home, with Mr and Mrs Philpott often sleeping in it.

After the arrests yesterday, police increased their presence on the road where the family live. Tributes and gifts left outside the home were also removed.

Mr Philpott, a father of 17 children by five women, became known as ‘Shameless Mick’ in 2007 after demanding a larger house for his family.

As news of the Philpotts’ arrest spread among neighbours, Anthony Slater of the community group Oscar, which has raised more than £10,000 for the funerals of the children, said he was ‘gobsmacked’.

A close family friend and godmother to one of the children said she spoke to Mr Philpott on the telephone after his arrest and ‘he’s not worried’.

She added: ‘He says it’s protocol. They always have to do this so they can rule out close family.’

Another friend, priest Father Alan Burbidge, said: ‘This is unbelievable and very, very sad. The community is in total shock over the tragic deaths of six innocent children.’
