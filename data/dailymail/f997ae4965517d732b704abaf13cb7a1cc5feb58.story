Arsene Wenger savoured another four-goal performance from Arsenal as his name rang around the Emirates Stadium and insisted the majority of fans are content with his work.

His team have scored eight goals in two games since he was verbally abused by a group of Arsenal fans at a railway station on the way home from a defeat Stoke.

Wenger's side beat Newcastle 4-1 on Saturday - a repeat of Tuesday's victory in the Champions League at Galatasaray - with Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla scoring two goals each.

Ayoze Perez was on target for the visitors, who lost for only the second time in their last 11 games. The home crowd sang: 'There's Only One Arsene Wenger' and the three points closed the gap on the top four.

'My job is to win football games and make people happy,' said Wenger. 'What happened last week … I work for 18 years in this country and I am grateful that I have been accepted by 99.9 per cent with a big respect.

'I can take the 0.1 per cent and live with it but my job is to make people happy. If they are not happy, I have to live with it.

'On one side, we benefit because we have become extremely popular. On the other side, the negative is that everybody talks and has opinions and that is what is maybe more difficult to live with when it doesn't go well.'

Arsenal are caught between two distinct views among supporters: those who trust Wenger implicitly and back him wholeheartedly and those who are grateful for his 18 years of work but believe the time has come for him to move on.

Defeat at Liverpool next week and the pendulum may swing back towards the anti-Wenger lobby, but when everything comes together on the pitch, as it did on Saturday, his team are still quick, creative and wonderful to watch.

'We try and it's always the same in football,' said Wenger. 'If you try to attack and you win, everybody says well done and when you don't win, everybody says you are not realistic enough. Our target is to keep our style but to defend well as well and that's what we did today.'

Giroud was outstanding, opening the scoring after 15 minutes with a majestic header and flicking in Arsenal's third with the outside of his left boot. Cazorla produced a deft chip from a tight angle for the second. 

Yet, even with this three-goal cushion, there was a ripple of anxiety around the Emirates when Perez pounced with a diving header to make it 3-1, with 27 minutes remaining.

Both Wenger and Newcastle manager Alan Pardew felt memories of the Champions League tie against Anderlecht, last month, when Arsenal surrendered a three-goal lead to draw 3-3, were haunting the stadium.

'You could see at some stage that we were a bit edgy, when we were 3-1, the crowd as well,' said the Arsenal boss. 'There was the ghost of Anderlecht here a little bit and we need a few more wins to completely lift the confidence.

'In the last six games, we won five. We can score goals, we showed that again and overall it was a dynamic game. Despite being depleted at the back we were quite solid and going forward we always looked dangerous.

'In the end we won in a convincing way. It was needed. The response was strong after the Stoke game. Let's go well over Christmas. '

Cazorla settled the nerves in the 88th minute by clipping a Panenka-style penalty over the dive by Newcastle's rookie goalkeeper Jak Alnwick after Danny Welbeck had been fouled by Paul Dummett.

'Arsenal came out flying but we weren't as efficient with the ball as we've been,' said Pardew. 'They didn't give us time. They were quicker and faster. We grew into it a little bit and I still thought at 3-1 that the game was in the balance and the demons might return from Anderlecht if we could get another.

'We have great belief and we don't give up and we didn't give up, even though not playing our best.'
