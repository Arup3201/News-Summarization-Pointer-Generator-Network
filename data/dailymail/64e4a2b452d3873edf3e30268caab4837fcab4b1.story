I’ve been at home in Halifax in West Yorkshire for Christmas, which is a rare two weeks in the UK for me. For six months of the year I live in Spain, playing for a wheelchair basketball team over there. 

It’s good to be back and see family and have some home comforts but after a week I’m raring to get back to training. I live in a town called Albacete, which is about 160 miles south of Madrid, and play for their local team. 

It’s obviously winter now so the weather isn’t the greatest but it’s still much warmer than home. It’s inland so we have to travel on a train or bus to get to the beach but I love living in a new place. I’m learning a new culture and different customs, which is just another bonus of playing sport at this level.

Where I am it is very Spanish, and removed from tourist resorts. With it being such a little town there’s not any big brands or supermarkets. It’s all little local businesses and I buy my food from a butchers and grocers which is quite nice. The atmosphere is a bit more relaxed, things happen when they happen, there’s no rush. 

As nice as it is to live abroad, the main reason I’m here is to develop my skills on the court. It was back in the summer of 2013 that one of the Spanish national team players approached me while I was at a tournament and asked if I’d consider playing in their domestic league. 

All the clubs in Spain get sponsored through the football clubs or the council so I can just focus on basketball rather than behind the scenes things like jobs and money. There’s good international competition out here, I’m playing against Spanish and Italian players, a real mixture of players with different performance levels. 

At home I’m always used to playing against the same person and it gets a bit stale, there’s little opportunity to improve. In Spain, I’m constantly being tested in training and in games. My team consists of five English players, three Mexicans and another five Spaniards. 

The coach speaks Spanish and English and most of the team speak good enough English. I’m doing two lessons of Spanish a week. I’m picking it up quite quickly in terms of understanding but the speaking is much more difficult. 

There was problems with my housing when I first got out to Spain so I was living with one of the other English guys but now I’m living on my own. They either gave us accommodation or offered us money to find an apartment so I’ve put money towards getting a slightly bigger place so when my family come to stay I can put them up rather than them having to stay in a hotel. 

One thing that’s been really good in this team is that there are no big egos, we all go out for coffee or shopping together. It’s great to get back in the Great Britain set up, too. I was part of the team that won the European Championship in Frankfurt in 2013.

That was huge for our confidence levels. Knowing that we’ve won senior Europeans twice (after winning in Israel in 2011). We have to keep our feet on the ground but there is that element of thinking, can anyone beat us?

There’s always a chance of getting carried away but we all know there’s a bigger goal, we’ve got to carry that win over and make Rio in 2016 a bigger win. The World Championships in Incheon, South Korea in July this year was a bit of a reality check. We finished seventh overall and were definitely expecting more than that. 

We went through the group stages undefeated so we were very confident but got beaten in the first knockout round. That gives me the drive not to let it happen again. After South Korea we all had a two-week break and then did an orientation camp in Rio. 

We had one evening where we went up to the Christ the Redeemer, which was pretty epic. Our tour guide, who was a local bus driver, took us around the Olympic Park but we weren’t allowed access to any venues but it all looked like it was taking shape. 

Seeing everything made it feel a little bit more real. It dawned upon me that in less than two years we should be inside those buildings playing for a gold medal with the best in the world on show. I really believe we can win gold if everything keeps going on the same trajectory.
