Nintendo has unveiled a new low cost handheld games console aimed at taking on the threat from mobile phone games.

The 2DS, which has a shallow wedge-like design and two screens, will cost £109 ($129) when it goes on sale on October 12th.

It is aimed at children and Nintendo hopes the low cost will persuade parents to buy it instead of a smartphone or tablet.

The firm is going after ‘not just consumers who have necessarily a phone or tablet,’ and want a taste of Nintendo's game fare, ‘but all consumers, especially younger consumers,’ Reggie Fils-Aime, president of Nintendo of America, said.

‘Nintendo has one of the strongest and most diverse video game lineups in our history,’ he claimed.

‘Today we’re making those unique Nintendo experiences more accessible and affordable.’

Experts say the surprise launch could pay off.

Daniel Krupa, UK Games Editor for IGN.com, said: ‘This new console from Nintendo comes completely out of the blue - but once you realise they designed it to be used by children, it begins to make more sense.

‘This is perfect for parents who want their children to enjoy video games, but don't want to invest in an expensive next-generation console, or hand over their precious smartphone or tablet.

‘Given Nintendo's growing catalogue of handheld games, this could be a huge seller this Christmas season.’

The 2DS is a lower cost version of the 3DS, a larger, clamshell design with a 3D screen - which the 2DS doesn’t have. It can, however, take pictures in 3D thanks to dual cameras.

The firm also announced a $50 price cut for its 32 GB Wii U console in North America and Europe from $349 to $299 - around £193 - following disappointing sales of the console.

Nintendo sold just 3.6 million Wii U units sold since launch to June 30 compared to 9.3 million units of its predecessor, the Wii.

However, the eight month-old Wii U faces stiff competition from Sony Corp's PlayStation 4, priced at £257 ($399) and Microsoft Corp's Xbox One, priced at £322 ($499) which will hit store shelves in November.
