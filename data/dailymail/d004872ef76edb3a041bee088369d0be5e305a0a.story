A ferocious leopard may have killed 15 people in Nepal over the last 15 months and now authorities have vowed to kill the ferocious beast.

The severed head of the latest victim, a 4-year-old boy, was found in the forest a kilometer from his home this morning, said Kamal Prasad Kharel, the police chief of the Baitadi district, an area 373 miles west of Kathmandu.

CNN reported that the creature dragged the child away into the jungle to eat, the 15th victim since the attacks began last year.

The police chief suspects that a single leopard, at most two, with a taste for human flesh is responsible for the deaths.

Maheshwor Dhakal, an ecologist at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation in Kathmandu, agreed that a group of the animals, which are common in the low mountain areas of Nepal, would cause even more bloodshed.

He said: 'Since human blood has more salt than animal blood, once wild animals get the taste of salty blood they do not like other animals like deer'.

He added that the actual death toll could be higher than 15, because there have been other animal attacks in Uttarkhand state in northern India, which borders Baitadi district.

Of the 15 victims in Nepal so far, two-thirds are children below the age of 10 and all are from small villages in the remote region. The others are older children and a 29-year-old woman who had gone to collect fodder for domestic animals in the nearby forest.

'No adult male has been killed,' Kharel said.

After killing its victim, the leopard drags the body away into the forest to eat.

'In the case of the children it just leaves behind the head, eating everything, but some parts of the adult body are left behind because it cannot finish it,' Kharel added.

The local administration has sought to raise public awareness of the dangers of going alone into nearby forests and has mobilised armed police force and local people who have licensed guns to hunt for the leopard and has announced a $300 reward to anyone who captures or kills it.

It is it is illegal to kill wild animals
in the region but the chief district administrator has granted a 
special dispensation for this leopard to be killed.

Dhakal added:'There is no alternative but to kill the leopard.'
