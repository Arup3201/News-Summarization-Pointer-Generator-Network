Classified ads: John Linder claims his wife Sharon had multiple lesbian relationships after advertising her services as a prostitute on ads site Gumtree

A solicitor is fighting to divorce his wife by claiming she advertised herself online as a ‘lesbian prostitute’.

John Lindner, 63, told a court his wife Sharon had had ‘multiple lesbian relationships for money and kind’. He named 13 women with whom he claimed the mother of his two children had liaisons.

Mr Lindner is trying to divorce her on grounds of alleged ‘unreasonable behaviour’, but she denies his accusations and has branded him a violent bully.

The solicitor previously brought a sheaf of adverts to court, which he claimed his wife, 37, had posted on websites including Gumtree and Yahoo.

He claimed she ‘had a string of lesbian lovers’ and ‘offered herself to other women, sometimes on a commercial basis’, the Court of Appeal heard.

His ex-wife, who has reverted to her maiden name of Rawlins, argued he had been ‘controlling and violent’.

In 2013 a family judge found Mr Lindner had broken her leg with a metal toilet roll holder, the court heard. He was convicted of assault and harassment, but the assault conviction was overturned on appeal.

Yesterday Lady Justice Black branded the claims ‘a distraction’ from the divorce and urged the pair to bury the hatchet. The couple, from Bromley, south-east London, who married in 2005, have been at each other’s throats since their separation in 2012.

Delays: Yesterday Lady Justice Black branded the couple's conflicting claims ‘a distraction’ from the divorce and urged the pair to bury the hatchet and finally end their marriage 

At an earlier hearing, a judge warned: ‘Precious family resources are being spent on this contested divorce and one can only guess at the effect on the children of the relentless litigation between their parents.’

But both have continued to accuse the other of unreasonable behaviour, Lady Justice Black told the court in London. It heard Mr Lindner tried but failed to make Gumtree and Yahoo disclose details of any advertisements his wife had placed.

He also demanded to see a police statement by a woman he claims had a relationship with his wife – Pauline Southerland, who had made a complaint of criminal damage to her Sky satellite dish.

Miss Rawlins insisted she and the woman ‘are not and never have been lovers’. But a previous hearing heard that Miss Southerland said in a police statement ‘she is seeing the wife and that they are in a relationship’.

Mr Lindner was appealing against a refusal to disclose that statement, but the judge dismissed it, saying: ‘More than two years have elapsed since [Mr Lindner and Miss Rawlins] separated. They could now be divorced … without the need to engage in hurtful, time-consuming and distracting litigation over how they behaved.’

It paves the way for a final divorce hearing, when a judge will decide whether either party behaved unreasonably.

Their claims and counter-claims must be resolved before they can divorce
