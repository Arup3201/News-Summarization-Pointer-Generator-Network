Miracle recovery: Daniel Sturridge recovered from a bout of meningitis to score Team GB to victory

Just a month ago Daniel Sturridge was facing Olympic heartache and weeks in hospital after being disagnosed with meningitis.

Tonight the 23-year-old was the star of Great Britain's football team, scoring the goal that ensured Team GB progressed to the Olympic quarter-finals.

Sturridge shone against Uruguay at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, an incredible feat for a player who just weeks ago could barely walk.

The striker's goal - his second in two games - was the least the team deserved from yet another 
encouraging display, which maintained improvement from previous matches.

It came on the stroke of half time, courtesy of Joe Allen's weaving run and drilled cross, which Sturridge gratefully prodded home.

Chances were otherwise few and far between, but Team GB did enough to deserve their place at the top of their group and a place in the final eigh - emulating the achievements of their female counterparts 24 hours earlier.

The men will play South Korea in Cardiff on Saturday night, the winners likely to face favourites Brazil in Manchester next Tuesday.

Sturridge's solid performance will have been noted by watching England manager Roy Hodgson, scouting ahead of the national team's friendly against Italy this month.

The fact the Chelsea striker is even being considered to represent his country bears testament to the swift medical attention he received after he was diagnosed with meningitis.

The 23-year-old stabbed home the goal that ensured Team GB beat Uruguay

He said last week:  'I just remember 
going along to a school one Thursday, handing out medals to kids, and I 
think I must have caught the bug there. I felt absolutely fine before 
that.

'I would not wish what I have had on 
my worst enemy. It is a really difficult thing to get through and, 
without the help of the Chelsea doctor, my family and my girlfriend, it 
would have been even more difficult.

'I was fortunate enough to have a doctor who saw the warning signs straight away and got me off to a hospital bed immediately.

Celebration: Team GB will now face South Korea in the quarter finals in Cardiff on Saturday

'I was quarantined for five days and 
if I hadn't taken any antibiotics in the hospital, I wouldn't have had a
chance of taking part in the Olympics.

'I am not going to say I would have died but I don't think I would have recovered as quickly as I have done and been here today.

'I went from being in tip-top condition suddenly to being sick and feeling weak. It was even difficult for me to walk.

'I thought that all my hopes and dreams of taking part in the Olympics were over.'
