In its most hospitable regions, Mars shares some similarities with the most extreme regions of Earth.

Now researchers have shown that some of the simplest and oldest organisms on our planet could also survive on the Martian surface.

Named methanogens, these organisms use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to metabolise and produce methane.

Methanogens in these test tubes, which also contained growth nutrients, sand and water, survived when subjected to Martian freeze-thaw cycles at the University of Arkansas

Methanogens live in swamps and marshes, but can also be found in the gut of cattle and termites, as well as in dead and decaying animals.

These ancient and highly-specialised ‘extremophiles’ are thought to be able to grow quickly in harsh conditions.

They are anaerobic, so they don't require oxygen. They also don't require organic which suggests they could exist in sub-surface environments.

The survival of these two methanogen species exposed to long-term freeze/thaw cycles suggests methanogens could potentially inhabit the subsurface of Mars. Pictured is a microscopic view of a methanogen

Nasa chiefs have said that sending a manned mission to Mars is 'necessary if the human race is to survive'.  

But
 the huge amounts of chemical rocket fuel needed to complete such a 
mission would require deep pockets – the launch costs alone would be 
more than $12 billion (£7 billion).

Added
 to this is the time it takes. The space agency estimates that a 
round-trip human expedition to Mars would take more than four years 
using current technology.  

Rocket-powered
 fusion, however, could one day allow 30- and 90-day expeditions to Mars
 by making the trip more practical and less costly, experts claim.

Scientists
 envision using a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen to very high 
temperatures, which will then expand through a spacecraft’s nozzle to 
generate thrust.   

Recent 
advances in manipulating nuclear fusion could means that astronauts are 
now a step closer to our nearest planetary neighbour.  

Researchers from the University of Arkansas wanted to see if two species of methanogens could withstand Martian freeze-thaw cycles below the organisms’ ideal growth temperatures.

Methanothermobacter wolfeii was placed in a chamber 55°C (131°F) and Methanobacterium formicicum in one at 37°C (98.6°F).

The two species were selected because one is a hyperthermophile, meaning it thrives under extremely hot temperatures, and the other is a thermophile, which thrives under warm temperatures.

‘The surface temperature on Mars varies widely, often ranging between -90°C and 27°C over one Martian day,’ said Rebecca Mickol, a doctoral student at the University of Arkansas.

‘If any life were to exist on Mars right now, it would at least have to survive that temperature range.

‘The survival of these two methanogen species exposed to long-term freeze/thaw cycles suggests methanogens could potentially inhabit the subsurface of Mars.’

A separate study earlier this month found that superbugs from Earth could soon hitch a ride into space, arrive on the red planet and trick scientists into thinking they are Martians.

This study was done by Nasa researcher, Dr Kasthuri Venkateswaran, who expressed serious concern that microbes may beat humans in the race to colonise Mars.

Dr Venkateswaran highlighted recent research that showed some bugs were more resilient than first thought and could use protective mechanisms to survive deep space flights.

Currently, spacecraft landing on Mars or other planets where life might exist must meet requirements for a maximum allowable level of microbial life.

These acceptable levels were based on studies of how various life forms survive exposure to the challenges associated with space travel.
