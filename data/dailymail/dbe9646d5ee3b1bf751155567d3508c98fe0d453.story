She is the sex shop queen most well-known for bringing the Rampant Rabbit to Britain.

So it is perhaps surprising that Jacqueline Gold has been unveiled as the Tories’ latest campaign weapon.

The Ann Summers boss was paraded by the party as its newest supporter, sitting in the front row as George Osborne and his colleagues attacked Labour over spending.

At the event, Chancellor George Osborne, flanked by four senior Cabinet colleagues, unveiled Treasury figures suggesting that Labour has already made almost £21billion of unfunded spending pledges.

Conservative strategists are planning to echo the party’s ‘tax bombshell’ warning about Labour ahead of the 1992 election – the last time it won power outright. 

Miss Gold, 54, who has a £240million fortune, transformed her father David's business Ann Summers by making the sex-toy and lingerie chain more female-friendly. 

It has 150 stores and 7,000 party planners, and annually sells two million of the Rampant Rabbit vibrator.

After attending an at-home Tupperware party, she saw the potential to use a similar concept to introduce sex toys and lingerie to women.

The all-male board initially rejected the idea of having Ann Summers parties, but when they started they proved a success and Miss Gold was made chief executive in 1993.

In a 2013 interview, Miss Gold said that she most wants to be remembered ‘for liberating women between the sheets, for bringing sex to the high street, and financial independence to thousands of women via our party planning’.

She added that she was often asked if she thought about going into politics, adding: ‘As a woman in business for the past 30 years, I’ve felt like I’ve been in politics all my life.’

Businesswoman and Apprentice star Karren Brady, a Tory peer, was in the audience at the event in Millbank Tower, Westminster 

Miss Gold’s unveiling as a supporter comes after Karren Brady, who used to work for Mr Gold’s downmarket Sport Newspapers, was made a Tory peer last year.

Baroness Brady’s big break came when she was asked by Mr Gold to take over the running of Birmingham City football club.

Yesterday, Baroness Brady was also sat on the front row over the Conservative Party event.

A Tory source said it had not been decided how prominent she would be in the campaign, but added: 'She's a successful entrepreneur. I think we should praise success rather than follow Labour's culture of envy.'

Last night Miss Gold told the Mail: ‘I have always been a supporter of the Conservative Party and was proud to support the event. 

‘As a British businesswomen I believe that only the Conservatives have the long term economic plan this country needs and that it is essential that David Cameron is returned to Downing Street after the general election to deliver it.’
