The number of corrupt police officers exploiting victims and witnesses for sex is on the rise, according to a shocking report.

The secret assessment warned that officers abusing their power for ‘sexual gratification’ was ‘a major concern’.

‘The number of reported incidents has been increasing nationally since 2009,’ it added.

The report was prepared by the Serious Organised Crime Agency for the Association of Chief Police Officers, or Acpo.

It also went on to say that more officers were dealing in drugs such as heroin, cocaine, amphetamine and cannabis. 

‘Abuse and supply of class A and B controlled drugs is occurring more frequently among a greater number of forces than was reported in 2010.’

The SOCA national threat assessment – made in June 2013 and the latest available – was based on three years of intelligence reports gathered by forces across England and Wales.

It was made public for the first time yesterday by the police watchdog as part of a wider report into corruption in policing.

Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary found overall that forces were making progress in tackling the issue and it found no evidence that corruption is endemic. 

But around half do not have the capacity to actively seek out and develop intelligence on corruption and fewer than half have an effective plan to root out the problem, HMIC warned.

There have been a number of high profile cases of predatory sex abuse by officers.

Northumbria police constable Stephen Mitchell, 43, was jailed for life in January 2011 for carrying out sex attacks on vulnerable women, including prostitutes while he was on duty. 

He raped and sexually abused heroin addicts, shoplifters and a disabled teenager by offering them help while in custody, then demanding sexual favours.

In 2013 family liaison officer Detective Constable Jeffrey Davies was jailed for three years for sexually assaulting victims of domestic abuse that he was supposed to be looking after.

In the 12 months to March 31 2014, 406 officers and police staff were investigated for sexual misconduct, a four per cent rise on the previous year. One in six were allowed to retire or resign and around 40 per cent of cases led to no further action.

Drugs were also a focus of concern for HMIC inspectors who said that, despite ‘an increasing threat from the use and supply of Class A and controlled B drugs by police officers and police staff’, only half of forces were carrying out random drug testing on their workforce.

The report said: ‘Forces that elect not to undertake random drug tests and circulate the results to their workforces are missing an opportunity both to identify and to discourage criminal activity.’

In the 12 months to 31 March 2014, there were 163 investigations into drug-related offences by officers and staff, with more than half resulting in no further action.

In one case, a constable and his son were caught supplying drugs to another sergeant who was selling them on. The constable was also providing police information to criminals. Both were jailed.

There were also 1,178 inquiries carried out into reports of theft, fraud and dishonesty.

Less than one in four forces also regularly monitored social media for misconduct by officers and staff on their private accounts.

Overall, in the year to 31 March 2014, a total of 37 forces out of 39 made arrests relating to corruption, with 1,138 officers and staff being disciplined or dismissed.

Referrals to the Independent Police Complaints Commission over police corruption also increased 30 per cent.

Bobbies on the beat are so worried about being accused of corruption they are turning down cups of tea from members of the public, a report has found.

The police watchdog warned officers risked being seen as ‘distant’ because some refused to accept anything from the public for fear of landing themselves in trouble with their superiors.

The report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, entitled Integrity Matters, said: ‘HMIC is concerned that the focus on ensuring officers and staff act with integrity may be misconstrued by some officers and staff who believe that no gift or hospitality can be accepted.’

It warned this may be ‘leading to some staff not interacting with the public as they normally would and being seen as distant’.

Inspectors also discovered that only around a quarter of forces conduct regular audits of their registers on staff declaring gifts and hospitality, business interests and second jobs, expenses claims and the procurement of goods and services in order to identify potential corruption.
