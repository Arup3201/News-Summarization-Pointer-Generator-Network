The World Cup is the greatest sporting stage and shop window of all and the footballing feast in Brazil has served up more than its fair share of magical moments. Barclays Premier League clubs will be baying to bag some of the wares on offer, and here are five players Sportsmail want to see in England.

Ahmed Musa – Nigeria – CSKA Moscow – 21 – Value: £8.5million

The Nigerian striker excelled against Argentina, demonstrating composure and quality in scoring two goals. The first goal, beautifully curled past Sergio Romero, was only usurped by the brilliance of Lionel Messi. Only 21 years old, CSKA Moscow’s pacy forward has already represented his country on 40 occasions.

Wonder strike: Ahmed Musa hit two in the loss to Argentina and can look foward to a showdown with France in the round of 16

Enner Valencia – Ecuador – Pachuca – 25 – Value: £7m

Three goals in three group games for the Ecuadorian who began his career as a raiding right-back before being transformed into a prolific forward. Valencia, who scored 18 goals in 23 games for Pachuca in  Mexico last season, also struck with a fine header in the friendly against England and may be an affordable target for mid-ranking Premier League sides.

Attention getter: Enner Valencia has three goals to his name at this World Cup

Guillermo Ochoa – Mexico – Out of contract - 28 – Value: Free

Perhaps the best in individual performances during this World Cup, the Mexican produced the save of the tournament as he hurled himself to his right to claw away Neymar’s goalbound header in the 0-0 draw with Brazil. Anybody that can keep out Brazil’s golden boy for 90 minutes must be worth a look.

A wanted man: Guillermo Ochoa is a free agent after his contract with Ajaccio expired

Marcelo Diaz – Chile – Basel - 27 – Value: £9m

Described by the Spanish press as the ‘Chilean Xavi’,  the authoritative Basel midfielder has patrolled the Sampaoli midfield with his intelligent positioning and sharp anticipation. Metronomic in his passing, Diaz has emerged as one of Chile’s most important players. Boasting Champions League and international experience, he would be a shrewd move for one of England’s leading sides.

Daley Blind  - Holland – Ajax - 24 – Value: £13m

The shaggy-haired full back has been relentless up and down Holland’s left flank for Louis van Gaal, displaying defensive acumen in shackling Alexis Sanchez in the 2-0 victory over Chile. His attacking forays have been the most eye-catching, though, and his remarkable delivery for Robin van Persie’s jaw-dropping header against Spain created one of this tournament’s defining moments.

Following in familiar footsteps: Daley Blind is son of Danny, former Ajax captain and now one of Louis van Gaal's assistants

And has there been a better individual performance than Mexico keeper Guillermo Ochoa's display against Brazil?

The 'Chilean Xavi' is plying his trade in Switzerland... would he be a shrewd move for a big gun?

Daley Blind has also impressed in Holland's defence... but is he worth his price tag?
