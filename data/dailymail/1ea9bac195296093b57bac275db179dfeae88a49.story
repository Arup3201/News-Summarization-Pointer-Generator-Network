Stoke forward Bojan injured his knee during the Potters FA Cup clash against Rochdale on Monday night and left the stadium before the conclusion of the match.

The former Barcelona youngster put the Potters ahead with a stunning strike after just three minutes but had to leave the field half an hour later after appearing to go down holding his knee.

Bojan was able to walk off the pitch with the Stoke physio but left Spotland on crutches and departed in a car, according to BT Sport commentator Ian Darke.
