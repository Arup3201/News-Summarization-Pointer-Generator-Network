Greig Laidlaw illustrated the magnitude of the task that lies ahead for Scotland against the All Blacks on Saturday when he compared it to facing Roger Federer in his pomp.

A contest against the world champions at BT Murrayfield inevitably has a flavour of the David and Goliath about it. Scotland after all have never beaten the All Blacks - two draws over the generations is all we can muster.

Yet there is a mood of optimism in the Scotland camp this week - buoyed as the players are by their sparkling performance in the 41-31 win over Argentina at the weekend.

And there was a steely determination about Laidlaw yesterday as he talked passionately about his desire to go down in history as the first Scotland skipper to lead his nation to a win over the mighty All Blacks.

‘We aren’t going to die wondering,’ said Laidlaw. ‘We are going to chuck the ball about when it is on, tighten up when we have to. We are going to try and play the Scottish way. It’s about grit and determination first and foremost and getting stuck in. If we do that and set our stall out we give ourselves a good chance.

‘For us this game I suppose is like playing Roger Federer at tennis. It is taking on the best team, the best competitors the sport has. The All Blacks have shown that over a number of years. They have consistently been the best team in the world.

‘That is a credit to them and their values and the way they play their game. When they play in the black jersey they are an incredible outfit. When we go out to face them on Saturday it will be the ultimate test for the players and the ultimate test for us as a Scotland team. We can’t go out there as individuals. We need to be collective and fight for each other.’

The 29-year-old Laidlaw has been on the receiving end of two heavy home defeats at the hands of the All Blacks, making his debut off the bench in a 49-3 defeat in 2010 and starting in the 51-22 mauling two years later.

The one big lesson learned from both games was the need to keep the All Blacks on a tight leash early on or risk the game being lost before it has really begun.

‘That seems to be the pattern for many of their games, which is why we need to try and start well,’ Laidlaw said. ‘We need to stay in the game for 20 minutes, 40 minutes, 60 and feel our way through the game.

‘We need to play with ball in hand as much as we can because if we have the ball it is easier to play the game rather than us trying to chase it down and defending. You get a lot more tired defending so we need to stay competitive and taking the game to them.

‘I think we lost 13 tries in the two games I played against them so we have to drastically reduce that number if we are going to come anywhere near them.’

The victory over Argentina last weekend, or at least the first 60 minutes of the match when Scotland dominated and led 34-10, has given Laidlaw confidence that history can be written on Saturday.

‘You have to think we can go out there and win and be part of the first Scotland team to beat New Zealand,’ he said. ‘We all know the challenge we face and if we are going to

get anywhere near them we need an 80 minute performance that’s for sure.

‘The fact we won that Argentina game was great for us but because we let in a couple of tries near the end means we still have our feet firmly on the ground. We are not getting carried away.

‘We need to be very disciplined this weekend and not get the yellow cards we picked up against Argentina. To get even close to New Zealand we need to keep 15 men on the field.’

Although Laidlaw is only Scotland captain on a game-by-game basis with first-choice skipper Grant Gilchrist being ruled out with a broken arm, he has gained the trust of head coach, and New Zealander, Vern Cotter.

Laidlaw believes that inside knowledge of All Blacks rugby will give the Scotland players a vital insight into how to approach the game mentally.

‘Obviously Vern has a strong Kiwi background which is good for us,’ he continued. ‘He hasn’t really been involved in the All Blacks set up, but he’s from New Zealand, he knows what they are all about, he knows the cultures and the way that they like to play the game and what goes through their minds.

‘That has been good for us, me especially, because I have been speaking to Vern to get an understanding as to what they are all about.

‘It’s clear to see the All Blacks have a great attitude every time they play the game. In close games they always seem to come out on top and that is not just not by coincidence. They are strong mentally and maybe Vern can give us an insight into the New Zealand way of thinking.

‘Easy is one word we won’t be using this week but it would be fantastic to win and we are going out there with that in mind. We know we need to play with pride and passion but whatever happens we are really going to give it a shot.’
