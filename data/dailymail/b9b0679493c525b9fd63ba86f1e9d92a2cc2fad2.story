She is a lady who has never worried about piling on the pounds.Â 

At the age of seven, Miss Winky, is now the size of a Shetland pony. The Saddleback pig will eat anything and everything and is not particularly fussy.

It is even thought her weight played a major factor in her unsuccessful 'date' with a Saddleback boar recently.

But, after much guess work, the moment of truth will finally arrive for the large pig this weekend when her true weight will be revealed to all and sundry.

Large: Miss Winky, a 7-year-old large white cross Saddleback pig is the size of a Shetland pony. Visitors to this weekend's Beamish Museum's Georgian Fair are being encouraged to guess her weight

Visitors to Beamish Museum's Georgian Fair in County Durham are being invited to guess Miss Winky's weight, with a prize of an unlimited Beamish pass to the person who guesses correctly.

She has been expanding since she arrived at Beamish at the age of one from a Northumberland farm.

'She is now the size of a Shetland pony. She will eat everything and anything and will eat all day long if you let her,' said Beamish's Chris Thompson.

'She isn't fussy about what she eats and has quite a girth on her.

'You could say she has no hourglass figure.

'A lot of visitors would feed her titbits but we are curtailing that and putting her on a bit of a diet to control her weight because she is getting so big.'

Miss Winky now has two set feeding times in the morning and in the afternoon.

'When her afternoon feed is due she stands on her hind legs and supports herself on the sty door, with her mouth open ready for her tea,' said Mr Thompson.

'When she does that she is about 6ft in height.'

But there is a historical pedigree for her appearance at the fair, which will be held at Pockerley Waggonway at Beamish Museum.

'In Georgian times at local fairs they would display all sorts of curiosities and large animals to pull in the people,' said Mr Thompson.

The fair will feature a quack doctor, a Punch & Judy show, a Georgian travelling swing boat and craftspeople at work, including a corn dolly maker and silhouette cutter.
