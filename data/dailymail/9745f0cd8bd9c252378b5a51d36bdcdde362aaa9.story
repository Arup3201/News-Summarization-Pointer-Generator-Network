They are the much-coveted jetset jobs that see men and women fly around the world to exciting destinations.

But working as cabin crew certainly comes with its trials - especially with the unusual requests often made by airlines.

From a minimum arm reach to jungle training and even an enforced single relationship status, airlines often demand the most unlikely situations and skills of their employees.

Qatar Airways air staff are required to have a minimum arm stretch of 84 inches while on tip-toes

To apply for a much-coveted job with luxury Gulf carrier Qatar Airways, flight attendants must have a minimum arm stretch of 84 inches while on tip-toes, presumably to reach the overhead lockers.

The same airline was the subject of controversy just a year ago after it was reported that female cabin crew must remain unmarried for the first five years of their contract.

The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) launched a campaign against the airline over its demands about marriage and pregnancy. The airline reportedly warns women who fall pregnant that they cannot be guaranteed ground staff jobs.

Qatar came under fire for reportedly not allowing air stewardesses to marry in their first five years of the job

Akbar al Baker told Reuters: 'If you come to seek employment with Qatar Airways we give you a document that these are the rules and regulations, if you as a mature individual accept those conditions, then you shouldn’t complain.'

He added: 'You know they have come there to do a job and we make sure that they are doing a job that they give us a good return on our investment.' 

MailOnline Travel has contacted Qatar Airways for further comment on the policy. 

That's not the only bizarre - and sometimes seemingly unnecessary - requirement made on future air stewards.

Air stewards working for TAM airlines in Brazil are required to undergo a strict Amazon jungle training

For instance, Brazilian airline TAM require air staff to undergo intense Amazon jungle survival training.

It makes sense. Over half of the country is covered in rugged rainforest and if an aircraft had to make an emergency landing among the trees, cabin crew need to be prepared. 

In fact, the country's government require any airline based in the country to offer this kind of training. 

According to Airline Reporter, TAM's course is undertaken by cabin crew in a section of rainforest behind their training centre, and includes instructions on using debris to build a makeshift lavatory. 

Meanwhile, Virgin Atlantic cabin crew - male and female -  must attend a 'groom school' at the airline's base in Crawley, near Gatwick Airport, to learn the company's staunch rules on appearance, which includes a minimum make up requirement.

'Stewardesses must wear mascara, blusher and red lipstick,' Grooming Manager Mim Allgood told the Daily Mail.

'The boys are allowed to use clear mascara and wear make-up - like to cover up a spot - as long as you can't tell.'  

The airline has its own shade of lipstick - Upper Class Red by Bare Minerals, which exactly matches the uniform.

'The girls can pick any red from any brand and they needn't spend a fortune. Nails should be red too, or smartened with a French manicure or pale pink polish.' 

AirAsia also has its own unusual requests, asking for cabin crew applicants only aged between 20 and 28 with excellent eyesight.

However, applicants are assured they will be allowed to wear contact lenses if needed, but no glasses.

EasyJet air stewards do not have such strict rules, but the safety requirements on their website stipulate that applicants must be able to tread water for at least a minute. 

Ryanair stops short of that but asks that all cabin crew are 'able to swim well'. They also request that stewards are between 5ft 2inches and 6 ft 2inches height 'with weight in proportion'. 

Like Qatar, Emirates requires that cabin crew have an arm reach of just less than 84 inches while standing on tiptoes.

British Airways underline the importance for its cabin crew to look preened at all times.They request that tights are 10 or 15 denier in black, or nearly black, shirts  well ironed and crisp, and nail polish must be red or very pale natural shades.

Amy James, Head of Worldwide Cabin Crew, told : 'We expect our crew to look the part and uphold high uniform standards, both in the air and on the ground. British Airways' uniform is one of the most distinctive and our customers immediately recognise our crew when they step on board.'

According to one  poster, apparently recruiting  cabin crew in Thailand, AirAsia requires air stewards to be aged between 20 and 28, university educated and with a minimum height of 5 ft 3 inches.

Those who fall short by an inch can reconcile themselves with the fact that they still make the Ryanair minimum height.
