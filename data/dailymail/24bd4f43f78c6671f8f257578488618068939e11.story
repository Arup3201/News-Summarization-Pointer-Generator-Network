Wonga approves 10,400 loans a day and makes £1.2million a week in profit, it emerged yesterday.

The number of loans handed out by the controversial payday loans company has soared by 70 per cent in a year.

Wonga, which charges stratospheric annual interest rates, was criticised yesterday for profiting from the misery of the poor and encouraging them to sink deeper into debt.

Citizens Advice said it was wrong that people were being ‘bombarded with glossy payday loan adverts which mask the misery of a life in debt’.

Chief executive Gillian Guy said: ‘Payday lenders’ profits come directly from the pockets of consumers, many of whom turn to them out of desperation rather than choice.’

MP Stella Creasy, who has campaigned against payday loan firms, said: ‘Money made in this industry comes at a heavy cost to our country.’

But Errol Damelin, Wonga’s founder and chief executive, insisted it was ‘lending responsibly ... to people who can generally afford to pay us back quickly.’

He said most of its customers were ‘young, single, employed, digitally savvy and can pay us back on time’, adding: ‘This is not about people on breadlines being desperate.

‘This is about us serving customers who want to take a loan and know they can pay it back in three days, in the same way that they want to buy one song on iTunes.’

Launched when the credit crunch struck in 2007, Wonga – which advertises itself on TV with elderly puppet characters Betty, Earl and Joyce, lends up to £1,000 at a time.

But there is growing concern over the ease with which money can be borrowed from the firm and other payday lenders at sky-high rates. Critics claim they encourage vulnerable people further into debt by allowing those who cannot repay loans to extend them, and letting customers take out a second loan before repaying their first.

Last year, Wonga approved 3.8million loans, a rise of nearly 60 per cent on 2011, according to its financial report, published yesterday.

After lending more than a £1billion in a year for the first time, it now plans to expand by encouraging customers to buy luxuries they would otherwise struggle to afford.

Its ‘Pay Later’ deal allows borrowers to buy ‘higher value goods’, such as furniture or a dishwasher, for up to £1,000, with an up-front charge of 7 per cent of the price.

Critics such as Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby want to set up rival, ethical lenders, but their ambitions  lag far behind Wonga’s successful business model.

But Matthew Lawrence, of the Institute for Public Policy Research think-tank, said critics were fighting a losing battle, adding: ‘Wonga-bashing isn’t working. Wonga’s profits make it clear that the campaign for affordable, short-term credit is losing, while Wonga is winning.’
