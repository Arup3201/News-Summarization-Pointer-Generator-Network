Alan Irvine has hit back at Joey Barton's claims that West Bromwich Albion 's*** themselves' when in front and urged his players to respond to defeat at Queens Park Rangers by beating Manchester City.

West Brom lost 3-2 at Loftus Road last Saturday despite racing into an early two-goal lead and sit just two points above the relegation zone ahead of City's visit to the Hawthorns on Boxing Day.

Barton was scathing of West Brom in comments following the match, won by Charlie Austin's hat-trick, and told team-mate Richard Dunne their opponents had gone ahead to early.

'I said, "They don't know how to win games and – excuse the language – they'll s*** themselves,"' said Barton. 'They don't know how to get over the finishing line.'

West Brom lost after going ahead against West Ham this month, and drew with Manchester United earlier this season – but have seen out four victories after scoring first.

Irvine said: 'The fact is we have won games and held on to leads. Like any other team sometimes you don't. We have players clearly who are perfectly capable of winning games. They have done that for us in the past and they will do in the future.

'Joey will know why he said it. I'm not going to pin his comments on the dressing room wall, but I am sure the lads are aware of it. Who knows, maybe we might use it next time we play them.' 

Irvine believes champions City cannot afford many slip ups if they are to catch leaders Chelsea.

'Man City will have to be very, very good for the rest of the season to make sure they can capitalise on any mistakes by Chelsea,' he said. 'I'm hoping their job is harder after Boxing Day.'
