New Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo is facing an anxious wait in Madrid to see if he will be granted a visa to live in the UK, it emerged on Saturday.

The Argentina international was signed by United 12 days ago and introduced as a new player at a press conference last Friday.

However, the £16m signing from Sporting Lisbon has still not played for his new club.

Relaxed: Manchester United are confident that the player will be given a visa and will return from Madrid

There has been speculation that Rojo has run in to problems over third party ownership – he was part owned by an agency when playing in Portugal – or that he hadn't played enough competitive games for his country to qualify for a work permit.

However it is understood that the actual issue is that Rojo is waiting to see if he will be given a UK visa as embassy officials look in to the details of an altercation with a neighbour in Argentina in 2010 that still lies on his file in his home country.

The 24-year-old was never prosecuted over the incident but it is still theoretically being investigated after the case was reopened in May of this year. 

Rojo does not have a criminal record but it is likely that Embassy officials are checking the exact details of the situation before processing the visa.

Rojo has had a visa interview at the Embassy and is still in Spain awaiting the outcome.

United officials are understood to be relaxed about the issue and see the process as a mere matter of procedure.

An Old Trafford source said today: 'Marcos had to leave the country in order to obtain a visa and then use it to officially re-enter the Uk to live.

'That is normal.'
