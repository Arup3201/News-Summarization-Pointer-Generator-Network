When Roy Hodgson was asked if a contest between England and Scotland could ever be called a friendly, he replied: ‘Why not?’ He has been at pains to stress his fondness for the Scots in the last few days, summoning his father’s Newcastle roots to somehow support his case.

With Gordon Strachan, it is not quite the same. Strachan, after all, was on the pitch as a fan when the Tartan Army invaded Wembley in 1977 and on the pitch as a player when Richard Gough headed the winner in the rain at Hampden Park eight years later.

Hodgson recalls the painful memory of Jim Baxter in 1967, but Strachan is connected to this fixture. When the nations met in the Euro 2000 play-offs, the last time England were in Glasgow, he was the manager of Coventry and stirring mischief, by saying: ‘The English stole our land... The English robbed us of all our oil... The English perpetrated the Highland clearances... And now, the English have pinched Billy Connolly.’

The Scotland boss updated those remarks for the 21st century on MOnday as he relaxed amid the roaring fires, stag art and whisky bottles which gave his team’s hotel base, on the banks of the River Clyde by the Old Kilpatrick hills, the feel of a scene from the James Bond film Skyfall.

It was only a shame the 57-year-old had opted for the man-made fabrics of modern sportswear as opposed to tweed.

‘Billy’s back, we lost him for a while but now he’s back,’ quipped Strachan, on the subject of Billy Connolly and who has rights to the much-loved comic.

‘That was 15 years back. Did I really say that? Is my lawyer in here? It was probably tongue-in-cheek, but that’s the way it went years ago: the Anglos at one table and the Scots at the other.’

The clod of turf he took from Wembley in 1977 has long since been left in the back garden of a home he had in Broughty Ferry, Dundee. ‘It was my honeymoon and I spent it in Watford,’ said Strachan.

‘I took my wife and my best man to the game. Unfortunately, his wife couldn’t get in. We only had three tickets, so she had to stay in the hotel.

‘I wasn’t one of the first on the pitch. I think there were only three of us left standing there and the policeman said: You might as well go on as well, son.’

The one-liners are delivered in a flash. It is like an audience with Roy Keane without the undercurrent of menace.

Strachan admits the wise-cracking is a defence mechanism which kicks in when the questions turn to subjects he would rather avoid.

But there can’t be many of those when his side are in such rich form. Scotland have lost only once in 10 — a narrow defeat by Germany — and are giddy about the upturn after emerging from a period of national soul-searching which accompanied the independence referendum in September.

When Strachan went to see the band James in concert at Glasgow’s SSE Hydro on Saturday, he found the live acts talking on stage about Shaun Maloney’s winner against the Republic of Ireland and the crowd abuzz.

They are not quite ready to relinquish their underdog status to England — the manager pointing out his team against the Irish contained only three players from the Barclays Premier League — but the first home game for 15 years against their oldest rivals could barely have been timed better.

‘Nobody wants to be rested, that’s for sure,’ said the Scotland boss, when asked about the strength of his team.

‘A wee bit of that is because of the fixture. We’re only human. If we were playing some team 70-odd in the rankings, we wouldn’t be as excited.

‘It was a bit like the first day of pre-season in training. We’ve got so many players who want to play. There were a few bumps but it was old-school rub it down and get on with it.

‘Top players have to play 60 games a season. If you want an easy life, go to a mediocre Championship club. You can get nine weeks’ break. If you want to be a top player, get your mind around playing every week and deal with that.’

It was not signposted as a message for Raheem Sterling, but relevant nevertheless.

England must be fully focused and committed to pass this test in the face of a Scottish renaissance.

‘This is a competitive game, even if there are no points available,’ said Strachan. ‘It was the event of the season in my time, but we never had a lot of live football on the telly back then.

‘There are so many big games on now that it dilutes interest. But this still has an interest.’

This does not mean it will be a ‘bloodbath’, he was quick to add. England goalkeeper Ben Foster struck a nerve when he noted the Scots and Irish had been ‘kicking lumps out of each other’ on Friday.

‘Ben doesn’t need to worry because he’s in goals,’ said Strachan. ‘It’s new to me, all this, we’re only 5ft 6in. On Friday, people went toe to toe. It wasn’t a nasty game. I’d have called it a really good game of football. There was a real intensity but no nastiness at all.

‘The game’s changed. You can’t kick lumps out of people anymore. There are rules in place. A team like Barcelona couldn’t have emerged 30 years ago because of the rules and the pitches. That’s why Ronaldo and Messi are able to flourish.

‘You have 22 cameras at every game and you get done retrospectively. If somebody elbowed you 30 years ago, you just had to wipe the blood from your face and get on with it.

‘That kind of intimidation in football is completely gone.’
