MPS who have smoked cannabis have ‘never recovered’ from the effects of the drug, former Conservative minister Peter Lilley has claimed.

Mr Lilley – who served in Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet and John Major’s government – said he witnessed the effects of ‘immoral’ drug-taking of colleagues.

Despite championing the legalisation cannabis a decade ago, Mr Lilley hit out at his associates who had consumed illegal substances.

Attack: Peter Lilley, left, has claimed in a magazine interview that some MPs who took cannabis have never recovered from the effects of the drug. In the interview he also suggested that Environment Minister Greg Barker, pictured right, was 'barking mad'. There is no suggestion Mr Barker took cannabis.

He told The House magazine: ‘I'm a total moralist on drugs. I hate the idea of getting stoned or drunk or anything. It’s immoral. God gave us a mind and a conscience and drugs effectively disable both your mind and your conscience.‘

In remarks that will be seen as swipe at fellow MPs, Mr Lilley added: ‘The only reason that I have a clear head on cannabis is that I’ve never taken any. Much of my friends, colleagues in this place did.

Mr Lilley said he witnessed the effects of immoral' drug-taking of colleagues during his years in the Cabinet

The former deputy leader of the Conservative Party had called for cannabis to be legalised through special off-licences in an explosive report for the left-wing Social Market Foundation think tank in 2001.

He had argued that cannabis users were being forced into ‘the arms of hard drug pushers’.

In his latest interview, Mr Lilley re-iterated his criticism of Environment Minister Greg Barker as ‘barking mad’. He had previously been filmed describing Mr Barker as a ‘nutter’.

The MP for Hitchin and Harpenden said: ‘He knows I think he's barking mad. And he probably reciprocates.’

The former deputy Tory leader also revealed he still had harboured hopes of a Cabinet comeback but admitted it might not be sensible for David Cameron to promote him.

Mr Lilley said: ‘I would've been happy to, but I wasn't totally surprised that it didn't materialise.’

He added: ‘You can bring experience into a particular department, but it's not like the flu, you can't infect the rest of the Cabinet with experience. I can't really convince myself that it would necessarily be the best decision for Cameron to bring back people like me.’
