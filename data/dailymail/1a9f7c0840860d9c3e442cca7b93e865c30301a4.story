High street fashion stores have cancelled orders for angora wool products after appalling footage emerged of the barbaric treatment of rabbits in Chinese farms.

The horrific scenes, some of which were published in the Daily Mail last month, show angora rabbits screaming as their fur is torn from their bodies while still alive.

In other parts of the footage, obtained by animal rights group Peta, the rabbits are seen tied up by the front and back legs, as their bodies are cut and bloodied as their fur is roughly sheared.

Angora jumpers were on sale in Topshop for £36 but the store has suspended orders for the product

Investigators also found that the 
rabbits are kept alive for several years in pitiable conditions – forced
 to endure their torturous ordeal month after month until their throats 
are finally cut.

In response
 to the footage and widespread customer outcry, more than 35 companies –
 including Topshop, H&M, Primark, Whistles and Next – have said they
 will no longer stock angora products.

Marks & Spencer has also said
 it will halt all future angora orders until it has ‘concluded our 
visits to farms’.

Stella McCartney’s fashion company said it will no 
longer use angora in any of its products.

A
 spokesman told the Sunday Times: ‘In light of information released 
about the widespread despicable treatment of angora rabbits, we have 
decided to stop all future use of angora in Stella McCartney products.

‘Although
 we have always guaranteed that our angora wool mix fibres come from a 
cruelty-free source in Italy, we are no longer willing to encourage the 
use of angora in luxury fashion.’

The
 angora rabbit is bred for its long, soft wool that is made up of fine, 
hollow fibres, making  it softer than cashmere and a popular material 
for jumpers  and scarves.

China
 is responsible for 90 per cent of the world’s supply of angora. 
Investigators went to ten angora farms and witnessed the widespread 
abuse of animals at each one. At half of the farms visited, a 
particularly barbaric form of live plucking is used to remove the fur.

They
 also found that the sensitive pads on the rabbits’ feet were being 
sliced open by the wire base of their filthy cages – leading to illness 
and infection –and they are never given the chance to dig, jump or run.

And after their fur has been removed, they are thrown back into their cage to re-grow their coat in complete solitude.

Shocking truth: The animals are constantly injured from throughout the plucking as they struggle to break free

Torture: The Chinese fur traders use the plucking technique as it results in better quality fur and more money

Peta,
 which is campaigning for shoppers to boycott angora wool completely, 
did not name the farms to protect its sources.

Peta’s campaigns manager,
 Yvonne Taylor, said: ‘Many retailers have taken on board customer 
complaints, but, while we welcome their decision to stop sourcing angora
 products, we would urge them to also pull existing angora stock.’

Angora
 has a trade value of £22 to £28 per kilogram, but the longer hair which
 comes from plucking, as opposed to shearing, sells for more than double
 that.

The rabbits can live for as long as ten years if treated properly.

Professor
 Anna Meredith, of the Royal School of Veterinary Studies, said: ‘For a 
rabbit to vocalise as it does in the video indicates it is in severe 
distress.’

Animal cruelty: The angora rabbits are alive throughout the plucking and are kept for several years, plucked every few months, before their throats are slit

Locked up: The cages injure the rabbit's feet and the insanitary conditions see many of them, such as this one, suffer infections and illness

Pain and suffering: The terror in the animal's eyes is unmistakeable as a worker with a Chinese angora trader stretches it out and yanks out its fur

There are thought to be more than 50 million rabbits on angora farms in China, producing more than 4,000 tonnes of fur a year.

In China, there are no penalties for the abuse of animals on farms and minimal, if any, standards to regulate their treatment.

It
 is by far the world’s biggest producer, followed by Argentina, Chile, 
the Czech Republic and Hungary, which produce the bulk of the remaining 
10 per cent of the supply chain.

Left to recover: After the rabbit had had all its fur yanked out it is thrown into a cage to regrow its fur in complete solitude

No hope: This young bunny is in the process of regrowing its fur while recovering from an eye infection in a naked steel cage

A new law was drafted in 2009, but has not been implemented.

In
 2009, campaigners exposed how down used in jackets and other items was 
being ripped from the bodies of live geese by Chinese suppliers.

Two years later it emerged that raccoon dogs were being skinned while still alive to produce imitation sheepskin boots.
