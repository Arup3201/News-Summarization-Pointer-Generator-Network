The last time he was in the music charts he scored a number one hit with a cheesy offering after pairing himself with pink Mr Blobby.

Twenty years on and 64-year-old Noel Edmonds has returned -  this time with a raunchy track that has turned into a club anthem.

The Deal Or No Deal star has become a chart star with a track titled Are You Ready? under the name Candice Cannes – the mannequin he drives with in his private taxi to stop punters flagging it down.

The techno track has been mixed by DJ Mark Loverush and he has sampled some well known catchphrases from Channel 4’s Deal Or No Deal.

'You can ask me the question,' giggles a suggestive female voice.

'Are you ready for the question?' booms Noel.

'I hope it’s a big one,' she says, adding 'What’s in your box?... It’s quite a big box.'

Mr Edmonds told The Sun on Sunday the driving force for the track was his wife, make-up artist Liz Davies, 41.

He
said: ‘I recorded a few lines but Liz is the brains behind it. I 
decided to bounce it off a few experts to see what the reaction was. 
That’s how it started.

‘Liz was adamant it wasn’t under her name as she didn’t want to be seen as hanging off my coat-tails.’

The CD and video feature a blonde woman with angel wings. 

Miss Davies said the idea for the track originated after she was given studio time as a gift: ‘We were having a laugh. It’s grown beyond anything we expected.’

This is Edmonds’ first hit record since he teamed up with Mr Blobby to get to the top of the charts in December 20 years ago.

Mr Blobby was a character on Noel Edmonds’ Saturday night variety television show Noel’s House Party.

A bulbous pink figure covered with yellow spots he sported a permanent toothy grin, jiggling eyes and communicated only by saying the word 'blobby' in an electronically altered voice.

The Mr Blobby spoof theme song 'Mr Blobby' was released as a single, and hit 1 in the UK in December 1993 replacing Meat Loaf’s 'I Would Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That)' which had been in the 1 spot for 7 weeks.

A week later, 'Babe' by Take That bumped it off 1, but only for a week. It returned to the top spot on the charts on Christmas Day and remained there for another 2 weeks. This single also became the first song to leave the 1 position then return to it since 1968.

The single later received the dubious honour of being voted the most annoying Christmas no 1 single according to the yearly HMV poll.
