There were plenty of fireworks off the field but precious few on it as Saracens saw off a cussed Sale side but did little to suggest they are gathering enough momentum to mount a serious European challenge.

Last year’s beaten finalists have struggled to hit the heights of last season – when they finished second both in Europe and domestically – and another display which lacked cohesion for large parts did not provide enormous encouragement that a corner has been turned.

But they are still in the hunt, and that is what counts.

No 8 Billy Vunipola, so disappointing for England during the autumn, won the man-of-the-match award with one of his best performances of the season while the second half was at least better than the first.

But the home side’s failure to secure a bonus-point for the second week running left director of rugby Mark McCall deeply frustrated. Victory at home to Munster and away at Clermont in the New Year remains the only sure way for Saracens to qualify from this pool. It is not an easy ask.

‘I thought we were patchy today,’ McCall said. ‘In the first half we didn’t get into scoring positions often enough and missed some golden opportunities.

‘We gave away three or four really bad penalties and spent too long defending. I thought Billy got better and better as the game went on but we may live to regret not securing a bonus point.’ 

Saracens number eight Billy Vunipola (centre) was a handful for Sale Sharks defence all night 

The win moves the Londoners to the top of Pool One but, with Clermont and Munster playing on Sunday, that position will almost certainly be relinquished when the final whistle blows at the Parc des Sports Marcel Michelin.

Saracens woes were summed up by the torrid afternoon suffered by former England winger David Strettle, who dropped the simplest of passes after seven minutes with the line at his mercy.

Far more seriously for the 31-year-old, who has enjoyed an excellent season for Saracens, he then suffered a nasty clash of heads 13 minutes later and was removed for a Head Injury Assessment.

Owen Farrell, starting at fly half for Saracens, kicked two first-half penalties against a Sale side showing eight changes – including regular fly half Danny Cipriani being omitted from the squad – after defeat last week ended their interest in the tournament.

Cipriani remains in contract talks with the Manchester-based side, with sources close to him suggesting a one-year contract extension is likely. Sale lost Henry Thomas, James Gaskell and Rob Miller last season but Diamond is confident of securing Cipriani’s services.

‘I’m very hopeful of Danny staying in Manchester,’ Diamond said. ‘Neither of us have been in a great rush. We know where we both stand with it. We will be showing a bit of ambition in the transfer market next year. We’re hopeful Danny will stay.’

Nathan Hines and Eifion Lewis Roberts scored the visitors tries, while Saracens crossed through Ben Ransom, Alex Goode and the impressive Vunipola.

But no amount of fireworks could light up the latest disappointing performance for Saracens.
