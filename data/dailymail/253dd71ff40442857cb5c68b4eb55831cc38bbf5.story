Despite a painful knee injury - and a broken heart - Rory McIlroy gave the thumbs up to life after another brilliant round saw him take the lead at the Memorial Tournament less than a week after winning at Wentworth.

The Northern Irishman shot a superb nine-under-par round of 63 at Muirfield Village, despite battling through an injury scare concerning his left knee.

McIlroy eased fears over the injury by posing after his round for an Instagram picture, which showed his knee receiving special ice treatment to ensure he can play on in the tournament.

The 25-year-old world No 6 was smiling, giving the camera a thumbs-up and looking content with his day's work. 'After a nice opening 63, icing my knee, getting game ready for tomorrow!' he said in a positive message posted alongside the picture.

McIlroy, a two-time major champion, was using a Game Ready System to treat his injury. The machine was developed by scientists and doctors using NASA space suit technology and circulates cold water from an ice reservoir through  a wrap, which is applied to the injured area of the body and provides compression as well as ice treatment.

It has been a difficult couple of weeks off the course for McIlroy after he called off his engagement to Danish tennis star Wozniacki, just days after the couple had sent out wedding invitations.

But on the course he has flourished since the break-up, winning the European Tour's flagship event, the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, on Sunday before his awesome display in Ohio on Thursday.

McIlroy picked up seven birdies and two eagles to storm to the top of the leaderboard on the first day of Jack Nicklaus's tournament. England's Paul Casey shot a six-under 66 earlier to take a share of second place with Masters champion Bubba Watson and Chris Kirk.

McIlroy was troubled by a sore left knee from his seventh hole of the day. Asked what was wrong, McIlroy replied: 'Honestly I don't know. I felt it on my second shot on (hole) seven. I think my foot might have just got stuck in the ground a little bit and torqued my knee.

'It was painful right after I hit shots and then I sort of walked it off for the next one and it was okay, and then it would be painful again. I guess I put it out of my mind when I was over the golf shots.

'I'm going to go and get some treatment on it now and have a physio look at it. Hopefully it will be all right for tomorrow. This is a new injury. I haven't felt this before.'
