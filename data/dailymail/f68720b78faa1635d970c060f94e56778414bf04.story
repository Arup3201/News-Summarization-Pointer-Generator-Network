A donor who gave £1million to Ukip is the alleged backer of an offensive website dedicated to attacking the three major parties.

Arron Banks is understood to have registered the site LibLabCon – which accuses the parties of killing off Christmas.

According to party sources, the entrepreneur is funding the endeavour – however he insists that he ‘doesn’t write stories’.

The site includes spoof news articles, one of which is entitled ‘Decembortion’ – in which a fictional Conservative spokesman says: ‘We don’t use the word “Christmas” at all these days. It might offend the Muslim and Jewish vote, I mean people.’

Another page refers to Labour frontbencher Chuka Umunna, who is half Nigerian, as the party’s ‘chief spokesman for tokenism’.

It also quotes a ‘Labour chief of spin’ saying: ‘We allowed so many immigrants in that now unless we kiss their cultural a*** they could all vote for someone else.’

The home page features a picture of David Cameron with the message: ‘For too long now, the political elite have had their heads buried in the sand and take the people for granted.

‘We aren’t right-wing, left-wing or any-wing… We treat all politicians with equal contempt.’ Ukip claim the website is nothing to do with the party, but it appears to have the support of their top people. Last month, Nigel Farage’s policy chief Tim Aker linked to it on Twitter, remarking, ‘Now this is good’.

The website claims Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg are all ‘best friends’ and grew up in lavish country estates, adding that they stuck together as the economy went down the ‘s******’.

It then urges readers to ‘vote for something different’. One of the posts defends comments made by Mr Farage earlier this month that women should not be ‘ostentatious’ when breastfeeding in public.

Ukip sources told the Financial Times that Mr Banks – who is worth around £100million – is funding the website, the domain of which is registered to him at the address of his firm, GoSkippy, in Bristol.

Earlier this year, he donated £1million to Ukip. Mr Banks is pictured shaking hands with Ukip leader Nigel Farage 

The site is hosted in the US, however in late November it was re-registered in an apparent attempt to mask the identity of its backer, the newspaper claimed. Mr Banks told the paper in an email, ‘I don’t write stories’ – but declined to comment on the site’s funding.

And one of the videos it shows – bizarrely set in Hitler’s bunker – does lightly ridicule Ukip.

The clip features the murderous dictator talking about breastfeeding in public and migrants clogging up the roads – a reference to an apparent ‘joke’ Mr Farage made about why he took so long to get to an event in Wales this month.

Mr Banks, who founded the Brightside insurance firm before his current venture, used to donate to the Conservatives. However he hit the headlines in September when he appeared at an event declaring that he planned to give Ukip £100,000.

He then decided to raise his donation to £1million after William Hague, the former foreign secretary, claimed he had never heard of Mr Banks, who once gave the Tories £25,000.

Mr Banks told journalists he had been Tory ‘all his life’ but believed the UK would be better off outside the EU, which he said is a ‘closed shop for bankrupt countries’.

Ukip’s general secretary was forced out of his job last night – despite the party clearing him of sexual harassment.

Roger Bird, 41, was suspended earlier this month following allegations by former party candidate Natasha Bolter, 39, that he propositioned her over dinner.

Mr Bird insisted that their relationship was consensual, and now an independent investigation has concluded the same.

However Ukip said his departure was ‘by mutual agreement’ due to ‘unfortunate publicity’.

Party official Lisa Duffy, who has run several Ukip by-election campaigns, is likely to replace him.
