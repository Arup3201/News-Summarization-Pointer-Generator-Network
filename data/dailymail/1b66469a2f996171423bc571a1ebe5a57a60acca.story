Gareth Bale has pulled out of the Wales squad to face the Netherlands next week with a leg muscle injury.

The Real Madrid star had been expected to captain his country for the first time in the absence of usual skipper Ashley Williams and Aaron Ramsey.

But after a long season in which he has struggled at times with a muscle contracture in his left thigh, Bale has opted to rest instead of play against Louis Van Gaal’s team at the Amsterdam Arena on June 4.

Huge blow: Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale has been ruled out of Wales' friendly against Holland

He's a winner! Bale scored Madrid's second goal in the Champions League victory against Atletico on Saturday

All smiles: Bale, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, has played a crucial role in Real's double-winning season

Bale scored the decisive goal in the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid to clinch La Decima for Real and played the full 120 minutes.

His place in the starting line-up in Lisbon was in doubt at one stage after the 24-year-old trained indoors rather than with the full squad in the build-up, but Carlo Ancelotti was always confident he would play.

Bale's absence will be a blow to manager Chris Coleman as he prepares for Euro 2016 qualifiers. 

A statement on the Football Association of Wales website read: ‘Gareth Bale has withdrawn from the Welsh squad to travel to Amsterdam to face the Netherlands in a friendly international next week.

‘Bale, who scored for Real in Saturday's Champions League Final win against Atletico has been troubled with a leg muscle injury for a few weeks.

‘His place in the squad will be taken by Fulham's George Williams.’
