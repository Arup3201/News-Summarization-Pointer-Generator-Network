Manchester United will not be trying to sign Barcelona
midfielder Cesc Fabregas, a year after failing in their on-off chase for the
Spaniard.

Fabregas, 27, is believed to be keen on a return to
the Premier League after a disappointing spell with his hometown club. But
while his first club, Arsenal, are watching developments, United will not enter
an auction for a player who is not on new manager Louis van Gaal’s wish-list.

Last summer Fabregas was the top target for David Moyes but,
after weeks of talks and two bids of up to £30million, the player decided to
stay in Spain.

The resulting fall-out saw Moyes and executive vice-chairman
Ed Woodward criticised for failing to land their man and their partnership
never recovered.

Van Gaal will try to persuade Germany centre-half Mats
Hummels to join from Borussia Dortmund and £12m Ukraine winger Yevhen
Konoplyanka is also on Van Gaal’s radar. Southampton left-back Luke Shaw is
still likely to join, despite Patrice Evra signing a one-year contract last
week.

Shaw, 18, will only sign on the understanding he is first
choice.
