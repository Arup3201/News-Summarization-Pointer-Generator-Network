Repeal: Nick Clegg has said that TV licences and winter fuel payments are going to well-off elderly people who 'do not need it'

Nick Clegg has signalled that the Liberal Democrats would repeal free television licences and winter fuel payments for the better-off elderly.

In a flip-flop from his position last week, the Deputy Prime Minister said those who could afford to give up the perks should in order to save money for future generations.

Those ideas would form part of the Lib Dems’ manifesto at the general election, he said.

‘Some of these universal benefits – TV licence, winter fuel payments and so on – are going to people who simply don’t need them,’ he told ITV’s The Agenda programme.

‘It’s not because of their age... but because they have the wealth to be able to cover those costs themselves.

‘I certainly will be advocating that – I hope other parties will as well.’

He added: ‘Alan Sugar having his TV licence [paid for] is a nonsense.’

His remarks are in stark contrast to those he  made last week following suggestions that the Government should treat wealthier pensioners less generously.

Social mobility tsar Alan Milburn said on Thursday that ministers should ‘look again’ at universal benefits for pensioners.

He said the elderly were not carrying their fair share of the burden of austerity measures.

The former Labour health secretary also hit out at the rises to state pensions at a time of a growing older population.

But Mr Clegg dismissed Mr Milburn’s idea last week, saying ‘punishing the elderly’ would not help younger generations.

The Lib Dems have previously said they are in favour of scrapping universal benefits for the richest pensioners.
