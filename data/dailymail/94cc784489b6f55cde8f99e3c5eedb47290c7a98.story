Saying goodbye? The Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid has featured topless models for 45 years

They have been featured among the newspaper's pages for 45 years.

But The Sun appears to have dropped its topless models - with no bare breasts featured on Page 3 since Friday's edition.

Today's edition features 'Hollyoaks babes' Jennifer Metcalfe and Gemma Merna in bikinis on a beach - with their breasts mostly covered.

And another story below it about an actress sacked from Coronation Street is headlined 'Platt's yer lot', which could be seen as a coded confirmation of the end of topless women on the page.

The images of the models have long drawn protests from feminists and a petition calling for the abolition of the controversial feature has attracted more than 200,000 signatures.

Now, it appears the call to end topless women on Page 3 may have been heard.

Yesterday, The Sun showed model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley wearing a bra - but it is not clear whether the cover-up is permanent.

The Guardian reported that the newspaper's management had made a 'landmark decision' to drop the pictures topless women, dubbed Page 3 girls.

In addition, The Times reported that it understands last Friday's print edition 'was the last that will carry an image of a glamour model with bare breasts on that page'.

The Sun's Irish edition stopped using topless models in 2013. Last year, Sun owner Rupert Murdoch asked his Twitter followers for their opinion on the issue last year.

He wrote: 'Aren't beautiful young women more attractive in at least some fashionable clothes?'

Mr Murdoch, 83, went on: 'Brit feminists bang on forever about Page 3. I bet never buy paper. I think old fashioned but readers seem to disagree.' 

Last night, Sun spokesman Dylan Sharpe cryptically tweeted that Page 3 would remain 'in the same place it's always been - between page 2 and page 4'.

A spokesman for the No More Page 3 campaign said: 'We're hearing the Sun may have dropped Page 3. This could be truly historic news and a great day for people power.

'We don't know the details for sure and there's still lots to be done, but this could be a huge step for challenging media sexism.

'And we are so incredibly grateful to all of you who stood up and said 'No More Page 3'.'

The newspaper's editor has defended the controversial feature in the past, saying women readers fully support it.

In 2013, David Dinsmore told BBC Radio 5 Live he was 'standing (his) ground' despite pressure from politicians, anti-sexism campaigners and student bodies.

He said: 'I think that it is a lively issue for people who don't buy the paper and we've done the research, done the focus groups and in many ways listened to the campaigners to say: 'What does it mean to our readers?' The result comes back a resounding "keep it there, don't take it away".' 

The No More Page 3 campaign group was founded in August 2012 by actress Lucy-Anne Holmes.

It has support from a wide variety of groups such as Girlguiding UK, Mumsnet, several trade unions including Unison, the Scottish Parliament and Breast Cancer UK. 

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who also holds the women and equalities brief, said the move was 'long overdue'.

The Tory cabinet minister said: 'This is a long overdue decision and marks a small but significant step towards improving media portrayal of women and girls. I very much hope it remains permanent.'

It also received the backing of Liberal Democrat women's and equalities minister Jo Swinson - though she criticised the alternative content in today's edition.

'I am delighted that the old fashioned sexism of Page 3 could soon be a thing of the past.

'I welcome this apparent step forward from the Sun, but I would encourage its editors to consider whether parading women in bikinis is really a modern reflection of the contribution women make to society.

'We need to ensure that media representation of women reflects the great achievements that women make to business, to families and to society. I'd like to see us providing positive role models for young girls instead of suggesting that women's contribution is in how they look.'

Girlguiding UK's Advocates panel  has today welcomed the move.

They said: 'We are thrilled to hear that the Sun has decided to stop printing images of topless women on Page 3. This is a hugely positive step for girls and women and shows the difference we can all make when we speak out together.

The No More Page 3 campaign group was founded in August 2012 by actress Lucy-Anne Holmes. Protesters said they wanted the feature to be 'removed voluntarily' rather than banned

Delight: A spokesman for the No More Page 3 campaign said on Twitter that it 'could be truly historic news'

'It is impossible for girls to nurture their ambitions if they are constantly told that they are not the same as their male equivalents. This is what Page 3 did. It was disrespectful and embarrassing.

'We would also like to congratulate Lucy-Anne Holmes for having the bravery to speak out about this issue and we join her in celebrating this great success.'

Russell Hobby, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: 'We are delighted by today's news that the campaign has finally been successful.

'School leaders understand the importance of protecting children and young people from inappropriate adult material, whether online, on television or within the pages of the popular press. 

'Our members have told us about the problems the easy availability of pictures like these can cause. Children - especially very young children - can find such images confusing and embarrassing.'

But former glamour model Jodie Marsh has led the backlash against the move, insisting on Twitter that 'telling girls they shouldn't do page 3 is not being a feminist'.

In a series of tweets she said: 'So-called "feminists" really annoy me. Telling girls they shouldn't do page 3 is not being a feminist; women should do whatever they want.'

Commenting on her career as a Page 3 pin-up, she said: 'I loved doing page 3, it was good money, I felt powerful, I was definitely in control and all the people (mostly women) I worked with were fab.

'I never felt exploited - in fact the opposite. I thought "Blimey, people are willing to pay to see my boobs".

'I am very much a feminist. I believe women can do it all and have it all. Women who slag off other women are just jealous and insecure.

'Women shouldn't be fighting to be equal to men. We are there already.'

She said campaigners should focus on more important issues that affect women, such as female genital mutilation. 

Page 3 girl Rhian Sugden, 28, also lashed out at the reported move, saying: 'It's only a matter of time before everything we do will be dictated by comfy shoe-wearing, no bra-wearing, man-haters.'

In 2013, the media mogul also seemed to hint that he was in agreement that the idea was outdated

Former glamour model Nicola McLean said she did not think Page 3 is a 'sexual equality' issue.

She told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'It has been going for many years, which is one of the reasons I feel so sad that it has seemingly come to an end.

'I don't think it is outdated. I think the girls still look fantastic on the page, they still clearly enjoy what they are doing, people still want to see it.

'Everybody still wants Page 3, apart from the feminists who are fighting an argument I just don't agree with.

'If you meet any Page 3 girl who has gone on to pose for the Sun, we are all very strong-minded women that have made our own choice and feel very happy with what we are doing.

'We certainly don't feel like we have been victimised.'

The protesters said they wanted the feature to be 'removed voluntarily' rather than banned.

Among those delighted at the potential news was comedian and Great British Bake Off presenter Sue Perkins, who tweeted: 'Goodbye Jugs - Hello Actual News! Congrats to No More Page 3 and all those who campaigned. Hurray!'  

No More Page 3 founder Lucy-Anne Holmes said last night that the group would not claim victory if scantily clad women continued to appear in the paper but it was a 'step in the right direction' if they were no longer topless.

She told BBC2's Newsnight: 'I'm not going to stand here and say 'there's going to now be women in underwear on page three and isn't that great'.

'The Sun could have gone 'OK we are going to celebrate women's sport on page three because we never cover that and there are women doing great sport and we would like to use the space for that'.

'The Sun hasn't suddenly decided that women say, think and do interesting and incredible things, it's still basically saying women are here for decoration, but it's a step in the right direction.'
