Two rogue builders who duped elderly homeowners out of thousands of pounds for shoddy repairs have been jailed.  

Johnny Jones, 48, and brother-in-law Nelson Richards, 51, inflated their prices, targeted vulnerable people for a spate of frauds between March 2012 and August 2014 in Cornwall.  

After being investigated by the council's trading standards over 17 separate reported incidents, the pair were jailed for three-and-a-half years and five years at Truro Crown Court today.

The court heard how the average age of their victims was around 75, their oldest target being a woman now 89 who lives alone. 

They were discovered after disgruntled homeowners were forced to call in new builders to correct their work. 

Halfway through the sentencing hearing Richards, watching via video link from prison, left the room, telling the court: 'It's too much stress for me to deal with.' 

One of the victims was targeted just days after the married man had been released from jail, it was said.  

'It started with an offer to clean out her guttering for £100 and before long he was demanding £2,000 for ‘rainy day’ repairs,' said prosecutor Ian Graham. 

'The horror does not stop there as this lady was required to drive to her bank in Falmouth to take out money to pay Mr Richards for work that does not need to be done at her property.

'Over the course of a couple of months she handed over a total of £17,900.

'Very little work was done on her property.

Truro Crown Court heard how the men used bullying tactics to convince elderly homeowners to pay inflated prices for unnecessary work at their homes 

While one of the men involved was a legitimate builder, they used his experience and business to operate fraudulently, the court heard

'Mr Richards ingratiated himself with her, phoning her several times a day, bringing her food she did not want.' 

Meanwhile Jones placed adverts in local newspapers to attract business quoting inflated prices for simple work. 

His victims included Kathleen Fletcher-Peters, Phyllis White, Carol Selfe, Frank Williamson, Rita Grant, Leslie Adshead and Bernadette Murphy.

Mr Williamson, 81, was conned out of £13,767, which included £440 to a double glazing firm for non-existent windows, and Mrs Grant paid £5,400 for work valued by a surveyor at £3,240.

Meanwhile, Richards - calling himself Richard Barton - had also targeted Mr Williamson quoting him over £36,000 for work around his home and garden.

Using the alias of Nigel Andrews, Richards also convinced Anthony Birch to invest £5,500 in a non-existent caravan business.

The court was told that when Mr Birch contacted Jones to ask about Richards, he was told he was dead having ridden a motorbike off a cliff. 

After pleading guilty to a charge of participating in a fraudulent business, Jones, a father-of-three was jailed three and a half years.  

Richards, who has six children, was sentenced to five years behind bars. 

Sentencing Judge Simon Carr said described the men as having 'preyed' on vulnerable people. 

Wonky pipes and messy workmanship were among the problems discovered by council investigators later 

Some of the people involved in the men's fraudulent activity were duped out of tens of thousands of pounds

'I sentence you both for what are very unpleasant offences. Often these elderly victims feel forced to hand over more for work they don’t particularly want.

'They feel unable to stand up to people like you. You prey on that.'

The judge said that Jones was a 'genuine builder' and that his business had not been set up for the 'purposes of fraud'.

'However, on a number of occasions when you have come into contact with the elderly you have seen them as an easy touch,' he said.

'I take the view that Mr Richards is a professional conman who targets the vulnerable in a particularly unpleasant way.' 

Richards was already in custody having been recalled to prison in November 2012 following an early release on licence in February 2012, the court heard.

In April 2006, Richards was jailed for seven years, later increased to 10 years upon appeal, along with three of his henchmen.

At Truro Crown Court a judge described how they 'preyed' on vulnerable people, telling they they needed work done on their houses and charging outrageous rates

Together he and his gang cheated 25 elderly people across the region out of more than £660,000 between 2003 and 2005.

In August 2009 his prison term was extended by another four years, for failing to adhere to a compensation order to pay back £569,869.

Five others were also jailed in December 2007 for criminal actions linked to Richards, and subsequently ordered to pay back a total of £184,182 between them.

Meanwhile, Jones was also previously convicted at Truro Crown Court in February 2012 for three charges of fraud and theft, relating to goods he had not paid for.

He was given a nine month prison sentence, suspended for two years, together with 160 hours' community service.

He was also ordered to pay compensation totalling £3,563 to his three victims.

Judge Carr was told that Richards' fraud was valued at £58,530 while Jones' benefit was £45,550.

As neither men had any assets both were ordered to pay under Proceeds Of Crime Act legislation a token £1 or face an extra seven days' imprisonment.
