Caesarean sections may have been performed on women with birthing difficulties since ancient times, but the emergency procedure has just been done on a sloth for the first time.

A female sloth who fell out of a tree in Costa Rica underwent the emergency operation after suffering seizures and vets captured the moment her baby was born was on camera.

The injured animal was able to snuggle with her baby who is shown swaddled in a blanket and exploring his surroundings, soon after birth.

The pregnant brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus) was brought to the Sloth Institute Costa Rica, after a local hotel worker saw her fall out of a tree, BBC Earth reported.

After trying to help her get back up and climb to safety, he realised something was wrong and called the Institute for help.

Experts quickly saw the was having ‘slow’ seizures and was finding it hard to move her limbs as the result of a knock on the head.

‘It was more like a neurotic tick than a typical seizure seen in human and non-human primates,’ according to a diary entry on the Institute’s website and upon close examination, experts found that while the mother had not fractured her skull, she was heavily pregnant. 

Despite medication, the mother was struggling to survive and found it hard to move. After a few days, she began to have contractions and could feel the baby kicking.

Making no noticeable recovery, the mother was taken to a vetinary practice and underwent X-rays (pictured) which showed that her baby was alive but in a breach position and was on course to be born feet-first

A c-section (pictured) was performed - thought to be the first time the procedure has been used on a sloth.

The sloth was anaesthetised and her bladder drained and after 30 minutes, the baby sloth’s head appeared. Here, the baby male sloth is shown shortly after birth

The brown-throated sloth is a species of three-toed sloth found in Costa Rice the forests of South and Central America.

It is the most common of the four species of three-toed sloth.

Both males and females measure between 17 and 31 inches (42-80cm) long and stand between one to three-and-a-half inches (2.5-9cm) tall.

Adults weigh from 5lbs (2.3kg) to 14lbs (6.3kg).

Each foot has three fingers ending in long, curved claws up to three inches (8cm) long.

The creatures sleep for up to 18 hours a day and are only active for short periods.

Most of their time is spent clinging to high branches and they only venture onto the forest floor to go to the toilet around once every week.

Adults are solitary, apart from during mating season when females emit loud, shrill cries to attract males.

The noise sounds like they are saying 'ay ay'.

Gestation lasts for at least seven months and baby sloths are born furry and fully-clawed.

Despite this, they cling to their mother's underside for five months or more.

‘I’ve never seen a sloth have contractions, but these “painful moments” where her entire body seemed to be cramping and her arms reached out for anything to squeeze…really seemed like contractions to me!’ Sam Trull, head of the Institute, wrote.

Experts at the Institute grew concerned that the birth was not drawing closer, despite the mother’s discomfort and took her to a vet in the town of Herradura.

There, the three-toed animal underwent X-rays and an ultrasound to confirm that her baby was alive but in a breach position and was on course to be born feet-first.

Another obstacle to a natural birth became clear, because the mother had a full bladder which was blocking her baby’s safe passage and making it unlikely that it might be able to turn around in the womb.

Sloths only pass waste once a week and consequently can store a lot - up to one third of their body weight.

‘We determined it was an emergency, and that the only chance we had to save either or both of them was to do a C-section,’ said Ms Trull.

The sloth was anaesthetised and her bladder drained and after 30 minutes, the baby sloth’s head appeared.

The male infant seemed to be losing body heat fast, but after it was placed against Ms Trull’s chest for skin-to-skin contact, the animal warmed up and was quickly swaddled in a blanket, where he seemed alert and curious about his new surroundings.

Despite the pioneering sloth surgery, the story has a sad ending.

Vets discovered that baby sloth had a heart murmur as well as difficulties breathing and feeding.

Sadly, he died a week after being born. And his mother gave up her fight for life a day afterwards, having suffered neurological problems since her fall.

Ms Trull said: ‘It was devastating but not entirely surprising.’

She said she is glad the mother and baby got to spend quality time with each other and were seen snuggling up soon after the birth.

‘I'm glad he had a week, and that he had some snuggles with his mum. I was at least able to unite mother and baby before they died, so it might not have been a very long life but at least it was a life,’ she said.

Despite appearing healthy at birth (pictured) the little sloth was found to have a heart murmur as well as difficulties breathing and feeding. He died at one week old and his mother died soon afterwards. Ms Trull says that despite the 'devastating' outcome, the operation gave both animals the best chance of survival and she is pleased they got to spend quality time with each other
