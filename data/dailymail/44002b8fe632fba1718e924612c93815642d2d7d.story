New rules: Crumb, the 22-year-old’s collection of recipes, offers snippets of advice calculated to turn many a Bake Off fan as pale as their flour

On The Great British Bake Off, she was eager for any tips the judges had to offer.

But now last year’s finalist Ruby Tandoh has ripped up the rulebook... and written her own.

Crumb, the 22-year-old’s collection of recipes, offers snippets of advice calculated to turn many a Bake Off fan as pale as their flour.

Miss Tandoh stands up for soggy bottoms – an unforgivable faux pas in the eyes of judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood – and disagrees with many of the methods 79-year-old Miss Berry uses in her 70 cookbooks.

Perhaps it’s not surprising that Miss Tandoh wants to break the mould, given that she once called Bake Off ‘crap TV’. 

Still, fans, who can tune in to the semi-final of the BBC1 show tonight, may want to hold on their chef’s hats. Here are Mary Berry’s baking rules and Miss Tandoh’s responses:

SOGGY BOTTOM 

Mary: ‘Often, contestants are asked to make a tart or quiche, and even if they bake it blind, sometimes the pastry is still raw underneath. Baking blind and drying the pastry out before you put the filling in. That’s the key [to avoiding a soggy bottom].’

Ruby: ‘The term “soggy bottom” has given rise to a national neurosis, whereby a pie is declared a disaster if its pastry base isn’t perfectly crisp. 

'These impossible standards might be how success is calibrated in patisseries and TV shows, but they have no place in the home kitchen. I’d go so far as to say we should champion the soggy bottom: I can see nothing not to love about buttery pastry sodden with fruit juices, or custard, or gravy.’

MELTING CHOCOLATE 

Mary: ‘Put the chocolate into a large heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water; the base of the bowl should not touch the water.’

Ruby: ‘Gently melt the chocolate – either in short bursts in the microwave or in a heatproof bowl perched over a pan of simmering water.’

THE 'KNIFE TEST'

Mary: ‘To see if the loaf is done, insert a fine skewer in the middle; it should come out clean.’

Ruby: ‘Don’t be overzealous: The knife needs to come out clean-ish, but if you wait until it is bone dry then you will have baked the cake too long.’

YEAST 

Mary: Uses fresh yeast in her recipes

Ruby: ‘There are many who argue that fresh yeast produces a better tasting loaf. I disagree.’

CHRISTMAS PUDDING 

Mary: ‘[After cooking] cover the pudding with fresh greaseproof paper and foil. Store in a cool place for up to three months.’

Ruby: ‘Just soak the fruit on Christmas Eve, make the pudding batter in a jiffy in the morning and leave to quietly steam for two hours on the hob while dinner’s in the oven.’
