David Beckham's bid for a Major League Soccer team has suffered a setback after the city of Miami rejected his plan to build a waterfront stadium.

The former footballer's business group, Beckham Miami United, had wanted to build on a site next to the Miami Heat basketball arena.

But today it issued a statement saying city officials determined the proposed site was an 'inappropriate location.'

The statement said Beckham's group would 'spend the coming months weighing alternatives.'

Beckham has spent the last few months 
exploring the creation of a soccer franchise in Miami and stressed the 
importance of a downtown stadium location.

It was the second waterfront 
site proposed by Beckham's group to run into local resistance.

The
 group headed by the former England, Manchester United and Real Madrid 
star needs to ink a stadium deal before it can win final approval for 
the franchise from MLS, the top professional league in the U.S.

Beckham's group has 
agreed to finance a $250million (£149m) stadium with seating for 20,000 and to 
pay rent for the stadium, which it has sought to build on public land.

Beckham's
 initial preferred site for the stadium, an undeveloped plot of land 
near the Port of Miami, faced criticism from Royal Caribbean Cruises and
 others who argued the stadium would interfere with port operations.

In
 the statement, Beckham said the second site, sandwiched between two 
museums and the Heat arena, was suggested to his team by the mayors of 
Miami and Miami-Dade County.

'Our
 package was the most equitable soccer stadium proposal that Miami, or 
any other city in America, has ever seen - 100 per cent privately funded 
without any local taxpayers money,' the statement said.

Go team! Beckham has vowed to try to attract the
 world's best to his new side and proclaimed he wants Miami to be home 
to 'The People's Football Club'

The 38-year-old's move into football 
ownership is expected to cost him £15million - around 25 per cent of the
 price other new clubs have to pay.

He has vowed to try to attract the 
world's best to his new side and proclaimed he wants Miami to be home to
 'The People's Football Club'.

At the launch, he said: 'Players are already interested into coming and playing - who wouldn't? Great players will come here.

'We have a list of players (we want). Everyone knows who they want. These players are calling me up and sending me messages.

'It would be disrespectful for me as an owner to speculate, but we want the best. But I want to build an established academy and local players who want to reach the top.'
