England may have thrashed Lithuania to take another step along the road to France 2016 but success has certainly not been confined to the senior team this week.

When the Three Lions teams are put together from under 17 level upwards, they have won 11 matches out of 11 during this international spell, scoring 27 goals in the process.

The under 21s won 1-0 away to the Czech Republic in a friendly on Friday, while the under 20s have beaten Mexico on penalties after a 1-1 draw and seen off the United States 2-1.

England's under 19s have won the first two of their European Championship qualifiers - 3-2 against Denmark and 1-0 against Azerbaijan, meaning they must defeat France on Tuesday to get through.

The under 18s got on a roll against Switzerland, winning 1-0 and 6-1 in a double-header of friendlies, and the under 17s won all three of their European Championship qualifiers - against Norway, Slovenia and Romania.

So, on the evidence of the past few days, a bright future awaits for the England team. Here, Sportsmail looks at some of the players to have performed well at each age group.

UNDER 17

Ike Ugbo

Age: 16 Club: Chelsea Position: Forward

Chelsea frontman Ugbo has set his sights on emulating club-mate Dominic Solanke by helping England's under 17s to European glory.

Solanke played a key role as John Peacock's side lifted the trophy in Malta last year and Ugbo scored twice against Romania at Burton on Thursday to ensure England made this year's finals in Bulgaria with a 100 per cent record. 

'It would be a dream come true for me,' said the Chelsea under 18 player afterwards. 'Seeing them win it last year, with Dom doing as well as he did too, it would be great to be able to follow on from them.'

Reece Oxford

Age: 16 Club: West Ham Position: Centre-back

Proudly wearing the captain's armband, Oxford headed home to set the Young Lions on their way to a 3-1 win over Slovenia in the second of their Elite Round qualifiers. 

Despite being just 16, Oxford has featured regularly in West Ham's under 21 side and is tipped for a very bright future.

Indeed, the teenager, who made Sam Allardyce's first-team squad for the Capital One Cup tie with Sheffield United earlier in the season, has been the subject of interest from Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United.

Danny Collinge

Age: 16 Club: Stuttgart Position: Centre-back

Scorer in England's 3-1 win over Norway, the first of the three qualifiers, Collinge has been a mainstay of the under 17 team for some time. 

He is something of a novelty in that he belongs to Stuttgart's academy in Germany, having joined them last summer from MK Dons. 

Reflecting on his goal against Norway, he said: 'I was over the moon - it was just being in the right place at the right time. But my celebration was a bit poor, that needs some work for next time.'

UNDER 18

Adam Armstrong

Age: 18 Club: Newcastle United Position: Forward

A pep-talk from England captain Wayne Rooney proved a source of inspiration for Newcastle hotshot Armstrong, who took his Three Lions goal tally to an impressive 19 in 24 matches with three goals in the friendly double-header with Switzerland over the weekend. 

Having scored the winner in Thursday's behind-closed-doors match at St George's Park, he contributed two stunners in a 6-1 rout of the same opponents at Walsall on Saturday. 

Already involved in Newcastle's first team, he has made 14 appearances for his hometown club and was also part of the England squad that won the Under 17 European Championships last season.

Tammy Abraham

Age: 17 Club: Chelsea Position: Forward

Abraham was delighted to get off the mark on the international stage after scoring twice in the 6-1 defeat of Switzerland on Saturday but it was merely the continuation of an excellent season. 

He is the leading goalscorer nationally at under 18 level with 21 and has also played a key role in the Blues run to the FA Youth Cup final. 

He will now compete with club-mate Dominic Solanke and Armstrong for an England starting spot. 

Abraham said: 'I just have to keep scoring. That's the aim of any striker. I'll keep working hard to be picked again, and I'll be doing my best to achieve.'

Taylor Moore

Age: 17 Club: Lens Position: Centre-back

Another Englishman abroad, defender Moore signed a three-year professional deal with French club Lens late last year. 

Capable of playing in central midfield as well as defence, the 17-year-old has become a regular in Neil Dewsnip's under 18 side this season. 

He too was part of the under 17s squad that tasted European glory in Malta last year, converting a penalty during the shoot-out win over Holland in the final.

UNDER 19

Ashley Smith-Brown

Age: 18 Club: Manchester City Position: Defender

It's been quite the week for Manchester-born Smith-Brown, who scored vital winning goals in the under 19's qualifiers against Denmark and Azerbaijan, keeping Sean O'Driscoll's team on course for the finals in Greece. 

Primarily a right-back, Smith-Brown is more than capable of playing in any defensive position and has been involved with City's under 21 side this season, as well as the UEFA Youth League squad that reached the quarter-finals.

Patrick Roberts

Age: 18 Club: Fulham Position: Winger

A key component of the under 17 team that lifted the European Championships last year, Fulham whizzkid Roberts has quickly advanced to the under 19 level and looks very much at home.

Indeed, in the initial qualifying phase he scored four goals and set up four more. Roberts made his Premier League debut last season and has continued to play for Fulham following their relegation to the Championship.

Izzy Brown

Age: 18 Club: Chelsea Position: Forward/winger

Another member of the England team that triumphed at the Under 17 European Championships, the prolific Brown has made the step-up to the under 19 standard effortlessly and scored in the 3-2 win over Denmark last week. 

He is already a member of Jose Mourinho's first-team squad but features mainly in the Blues under 21 squad and the under 19 team that has reached the last four of the UEFA Youth League.

UNDER 20

John Swift

Age: 19 Club: Chelsea Position: Central midfield

An accomplished central midfield player, Swift has worked his way up the England youth ladder from the under 16s and is now a central cog in Aidy Boothroyd's under 20s. 

He opened the scoring in Sunday's 2-1 win over the United States in Plymouth. Brought through the Chelsea academy, Swift is currently out on loan at League One club Swindon Town to gain experience and has impressed, scoring two goals in 10 matches as they push for promotion.

Moses Odubajo

Age: 21 Club: Brentford Position: Right-back

Brentford's Odubajo was called into the under 20 squad by coach Aidy Boothroyd for the first time and impressed in both matches to suggest that future appearances in the Three Lions shirt may be on the cards. 

The 21-year-old has been important in Brentford's surprising push for Premier League promotion this season and made the transition to the international arena effortlessly, putting himself in the frame for a place in Gareth Southgate's under 21 squad for the summer's European Championships.

Alex Mowatt

Age: 20 Club: Leeds United Position: Midfield

This was Mowatt's second appearance in the colours of England and he made a strong case for future inclusion with a good performance in the win over the United States. 

His form in that match compliments his good season for Leeds United in the Championship, where he has made 31 appearances in all competitions and become a mainstay of the side.

UNDER 21

Tom Carroll

Age: 22 Club: Swansea City on loan from Tottenham Hotspur Position: Midfielder

Scored the winning goal as England under 21s defeated the Czech Republic, host nation of this summer's European Championships, on Friday night. 

The midfielder has been a part of Gareth Southgate's squad for some time and has been playing for Swansea City during this campaign on loan from Spurs.

John Stones

Age: 20 Club: Everton Position: Defender

A player who has experience with the senior team but seems content to gain experience with the under 21s for the time being. He figured in the win over the Czech Republic and looks set to be included in the squad for the Euros in the summer. 

Still only 20, Stones is a regular fixture in the Everton defence and manager Roberto Martinez has tipped him for a bright future for both club and country.

Matt Targett

Age: 19 Club: Southampton Position: Left-back

Another product of Southampton's prolific production line, Targett made the jump up to under 21 standard on Friday night having previously played for the under 19s and under 20s.

It has also been a breakthrough season for the 19-year-old at club level, with Ronald Koeman playing him in 12 Saints matches this term.
