Marin Cilic hailed the impact of coach Goran Ivanisevic after winning his first Grand Slam title at the US Open.

Cilic became the first Croatian to win a major title since Ivanisevic's famous triumph at Wimbledon 2001 with a stunning 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 win over Kei Nishikori in New York on Monday.

And Cilic was full of praise for the improvements Ivanisevic has helped make to his game after the pair started working together in September 2013.

Cilic said: 'He brought just, in the team, a very relaxed atmosphere, besides extremely huge knowledge.

'At the beginning when we started to work, we sat together and Goran told me that my game and my tennis has to be aggressive tennis.

'I can't play too much tactically, because most of the times before I was dealing too much with the tactics against players and not focusing on my game.

'It wasn't easy to change my perspective and to change completely my mindset. It took even five, six months of the tournaments to be able to sink that into me and that I know on the court that's the right way for me to play.

'Definitely my serve has improved enormously, and then everything else has followed.'

Cilic, 25, will now move up to No 9 in the world rankings after claiming a title which seemed unthinkable prior to the tournament, even for the man himself.

He said: 'It seems completely unreal to be called Grand Slam champion. I was dreaming about this all my life, and suddenly the last four, five days everything started to change, and with my tennis especially.

'It means everything. It's just a huge accomplishment and huge moment for myself and for my team and for everybody around me who was with me all these years supporting me, believing in me and never giving up. This is just the peak of the world.'

Despite a disappointing end to the tournament, Nishikori's run to the final was impressive considering that he missed both the Toronto and Cincinnati Masters last month after having a cyst removed from his right foot.

The Japanese 24-year-old - who will move to a career-high No 8 in the rankings - will take the positives from his fortnight at Flushing Meadows, which included two stunning consecutive victories against Stan Wawrinka and world No 1 Novak Djokovic.

Nishikori said: 'It was one of the worst matches I played today, but also he was very aggressive and very fast. I was, I have to say, a little bit nervous.

'I didn't expect anything coming here. Before I was injured and [had] little practice.

Following in the footsteps: Cilic became the first Croatian since Ivanisevic to win a grand slam

'There is so many positive things for sure that I can have from these two weeks beating Stan and Novak again.

'I think I showed I can beat anybody now. So if I can keep training hard and also practice hard, I think I have more chances coming up.'
