LEONARD ELLERBE (CEO of Mayweather Promotions): 'We are very excited to be making history today by officially announcing the biggest event in boxing history and one of the biggest sporting events ever. 

'I'd like to thank Floyd and Manny for the role they played in making this happen - that meeting in Miami was a major milestone.' 

BOB ARUM (CEO of Top Rank): 'It is great to be part of an event which so elevates the sport of boxing. When we compare it to other events - major events like the Superbowl, even the Olympics - we get worldwide attention to those events, and it's been rare that worldwide attention focuses on a boxing match.

'Thanks to the work of everyone, the whole world will be watching this great event unfold. It's a credit to the sport of boxing that we have been able to put on such an event.' 

STEPHEN ESPINOZA (Executive VP of Showtime Sports): 'We are not at all surprised that this fight is happening. As soon as we closed our deal with Floyd back in 2013, the Pacquiao fight was a top priority both for Floyd and for us. 

'Whenever it was time to discuss a Mayweather opponent, Manny Pacquiao was always high on Floyd's list. And again that is no surprise to us, we've known for at least five years now that Floyd has wanted the Pacquiao fight pretty badly.' 

FREDDIE ROACH (Manny Pacquiao's trainer): 'I'd like to thank all the people that made this fight happen. I love challenges and this is the biggest challenge of my life - and it is finally here.

'I've been looking forward to this for a long time. I'm going to get my fighter as ready as possible. We are in the toughest fight of our lives, we are fighting the best fighter in the world... but we are going to kick his ass.I'm sorry, but good luck, Floyd.' 

MANNY PACQUIAO: 'I'd like to thank God for providing us a wonderful day and giving us strength. I want to thank Showtime and HBO for helping to make this fight happen and also Mayweather promotions, Top Rank promotions and Team Pacquiao. 

'For the fans of boxing, I believe, this is what you are waiting for since five years ago. The fight is on and I know you are very excited. Both of us are going to undergo hard training for this fight and we will do our best on May 2 to make you (the fans) happy.

'The most important thing is the name of the Lord - that the name of the Lord will be glorified.  

'I want to let the people know that God can raise someone from nothing in to something - and that is me. I came from nothing in to something and I owe everything to God. He gave me this blessing so it all credit to the Lord. 

'I want to thank all the Flippino fans who are always supporting me, some are watching at home and some are here. I want to thank Freddie Roach for being very nice to us, Team Pacquiao, nice to me and Bob Arum. We have loyalty between us because we have been working together since 2001 until now 2015 and we  are the longest teamwork in boxing history as a trainer and boxer. And also to Bob Arum, my loyalty is to them. Thank you for trusting me and God bless you.'

FLOYD MAYWEATHER: 'First off, I have to thank my father. Unbelievable trainer, unbelievable person. I want to thank Showtime, MGM Grand, so many different social media outlets, the fans, Team Pacquiao, Top Rank. 

'It has been a long road but we are here now. Al Haymon - remarkable guy. If it wasnt for Al Haymon, my father, Lenoard, I wouldn't be where I am today so I want to say thank you. 

'May 2 - the fight of the century. It is all about the best fighting the best and Pacquiao is one of the best fighters of this era. And everything is about timing and we couldn't choose a better time.

'Our game plan is to be smart and take one fight at a time - like all 47 fights.

'This is a fight the world can't miss, it is an unbelievable match-up. Action packed fight. I'm in the gym working right now, dedicating myself to the sport, pushing myself to the limit, because I've never wanted to win a fight so much in my life.

'And I'm sure he is pushing himself to the limit because he wants to win just same way I want ot win.  

'But one thing I do know about any sport, when you lose it is in your mind. If you've lost once it is in your mind. If you've lost twice, it is in your mind. From day one I've was always taught to be a winner. No matter what be a winner. Push yourself to the limit, stay focused and be the best you can be. 

'Stephen Ezpinoza I want to thank you, Richard Stern I want to thank you, Bob Arum, Team Pacquiao because without everyone together we couldn't make this fight happen so I have to be thankful for us coming together as one so that we can give the world what they want to see: Mayweather-Pacquiao. 

'To all the people tuning in I want to say thank you. I'm pretty sure you are going to see hashtags on Twitter, Instagram, Shots. May 2 that is when the world stops, I want everyone to tune in, Mayweather-PAcquiao the biggest fight in history. Thank you.'
