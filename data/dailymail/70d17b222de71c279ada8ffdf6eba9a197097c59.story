Arsenal became the first English team to be knocked out of the UEFA Youth League this season after losing 1-0 to Atletico Madrid's youngsters on Tuesday.

Highly-rated teens Dan Crowley, Gedion Zelalem and Ainsley Maitland-Niles started for the Gunners in Spain, but they couldn't break down the hosts despite Theo's sending off late on.

Amath Diedhiou scored the only goal of the game after less than 60 seconds to see Atletico through to the quarter-finals.

Despite speculation, there was no place for new signing Kyrstian Bielik in the starting line-up, with the young Pole short on match practice after a winter break.

Steve Gatting kept faith in the same team that saw Arsenal through to the last 16, but the game couldn't have started any worse for his side.

Diedhiou of Senegal opened the scoring in Atletico's first attack, as the hosts nipped the ball off Arsenal from kick off.

The visitors struggled to find their rhythm for 45 minutes, but had a flurry of chances in the second half.

Stephy Mavididi went close after the restart, while Kaylen Hinds should have done better with 10 minutes remaining.

The game was poised for a frantic finish after Theo's red card, and the Gunners nearly levelled in the dying seconds, though Maitland-Niles' effort fizzed just wide.
