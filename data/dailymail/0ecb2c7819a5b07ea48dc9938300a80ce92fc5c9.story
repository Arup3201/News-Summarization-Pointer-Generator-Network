We all know that working in an office environment can lead to disagreements over the smallest things, but one man has managed to capture the workplace as never seen before.

Whether it's enduring an appraisal, or simply day dreaming at your desk, a quirky set of pictures use miniature figurines to note the trials and tribulations of the working world.

Taken by photographer and brand strategist, Derrick Lin, 38, from Columbus, Ohio, each scene gives a snap shot into the everyday goings on of a busy marketing agency.

After employers at US advertising company, Resource, decided to host an internal Instagram content, creative thinker, Derrick, set out to create pictures that every office worker could relate to.

It's safe to say that Derrick won the contest and what started as in-house project has now evolved into an ongoing series.

Using miniature figurines normally found in model train sets to stage different scenes, each photograph is then accompanied with a telling caption that summarises a particular moment in time, be it success or failure.

Luckily, his colleagues don't seem to mind his lunch time antics and often volunteer themselves as a prop for the next picture.

Mr Lin said: ‘I have always been fascinated by all things miniature and by small details so it occurred to me that the miniature figures, with the contrast of their size and their lively poses, could be a great medium to express our many emotions.

‘In the advertising industry, every day moves fast and sometimes it can be stressful, our work days are never short of those little moments any agency person will immediately understand.

‘But I realised that those moments were actually universal and that anyone who works in an office could easily relate to them.

‘I try to find the amusing light out of our daily frustrations, be it stress, escape or imagination.

‘I actually start with the captions, I look for a humorous and straightforward way to visualize each idea and then I think about how to plant the punch line alongside the picture without being too obvious.

‘I use my iPhone and office lighting to take the photos because I want to achieve a friendly and "everyday" style.

‘Shortly after starting my Instagram page, I had coworkers cheering for me and volunteering to be in the pictures, they are always encouraging me to share my series with the internet.

‘The figures are actually HO-scale model train figures, I would simply collect the figures I thought were fun, and then think about what to create with them.’
