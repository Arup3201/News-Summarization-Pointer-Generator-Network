It has sweeping views of Sydney's waterfront and all the modern day luxuries a mansion should have, but it seems no one wants to live in it.

This five-bedroom home in Baysview, just north of Sydney, has been on the market for a whopping seven years and four months - making it Sydney's oldest house listing.

The mansion on Minkara Road has passed through the hands of seven different real estate agents since it was first listed in March 2007 for $6.2 million.

It has dropped $2 million in price since then and is currently listed for $4.6 million with Graeme Keats of Bayview Beach Real Estate.

'It’s the longest listing I’ve ever had,' Mr Keats told the Daily Telegraph.

'We almost exchanged contracts on the property a few times, but buyers have always pulled out at the last minute.'

The property is Sydney's oldest house listing and has dropped $2 million in price since it was first listed

The 5,200 sqm property overlooks Pittwater and the Pacific Ocean and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms.

The backyard is equipped with a tennis court and swimming pool.

While luxury homes can often take longer to sell, this 2,684 day listing is exceptionally long considering the average sale turnover for Sydney is 29 days, according to Mr Keats.

People looking at homes that have struggled to sell often think there is something wrong with the home, even if it was just overpriced when it was first listed, according to the agent.
