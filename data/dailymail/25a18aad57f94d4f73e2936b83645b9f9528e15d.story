Cherie and Euan Blair bought the flats in Manchester for £650,000 

Cherie Blair has dramatically expanded her family’s property empire by buying a block of flats.

The ten apartments in Manchester take the Blairs’ portfolio to 18 homes.

However, Mrs Blair is trying to sell the remaining flat from the notorious ‘Cheriegate’ scandal in 2002, when she bought two properties in Bristol with the help of a convicted fraudster.

She has already slashed the asking price of that two-bedroom apartment, which has barely risen in value in 12 years.

But the ten flats in Manchester seem a more promising investment, even though they come complete with a stinking rubbish dump at the back – and one of the residents is a Tory activist.

Mrs Blair may have noticed a recent Nationwide house price survey saying prices in Manchester are rising at the fastest rate in the UK, beating even London. 

Within weeks, she and eldest son Euan paid a knock-down £650,000 for the ten-apartment block, five miles from Manchester city centre, via a company they set up earlier this year, Oldbury Residential Ltd.

The flats are within two adjoining double-fronted Victorian houses which have been on sale for some time. Described by the estate agent as an ‘excellent buy-to-let investment’, the property was originally on the market for £850,000.

Sources close to the Blair family said they plan to renovate the flats and rent them out to young professionals.

The estate agent’s blurb said: ‘This prestigious development consists of nine luxury apartments and a simply spectacular and utterly unique luxury penthouse apartment. 

These apartments are currently tenanted, achieving a rental return of £4,650 per month.’

Residents complained the rubbish had not been cleared for weeks before it was reported the Blairs had bought the building  - the rear of which is pictured

One tenant yesterday urged Mrs Blair to improve the upkeep of the four-storey building.

McDonald’s worker Danielle Jackson, 24, who moved in with her fiance three months ago, said: ‘I hope she takes a personal approach to managing the properties because we’ve had a few problems.

‘There’s a rubbish dump at the back which hasn’t been cleared since I moved in, it’s such an eyesore and stinks. It could attract vermin. I hope she keeps the rent down because we can only just afford it. It’s a lovely area.’

Another resident, Tory party campaign worker, Alex Finney, 24, said: ‘I’ll give her a cup of tea if she comes for an inspection but I’ll have to try hard to keep my opinions to myself.’

The flat is about 30 miles from Bootle, the Labour stronghold on Merseyside where Euan, 30, is said to be interested in becoming a parliamentary candidate.

Danielle Jackson, who moved in to the building three months ago with her fiance, is hopeful the Blairs will be good landlords 

A pile of rubbish at the rear of the flats had not been cleared today as tenants spoke of their desire for change 

Meanwhile, Mrs Blair, 60, is keen to sell her remaining ‘nightmare’ flat in Bristol, having sold the other in 2008.

She paid £525,000 for them following a £69,000 discount negotiated by Peter Foster, an Australian conman who is still on the run.

At the time, Foster was dating Mrs Blair’s confidante Carole Caplin, a former topless model.

The Blairs bought the flats because their son Euan was going to Bristol University there. One was for him, the other was a buy-to-let investment.

They sold the first flat in 2008 for £260,000, meaning they made no profit. The second was put on the market for £330,000 but the asking price has recently been dropped to £315,000.

Mrs Blair has also sold the £1million home she owned with her lawyer daughter Kathryn, 26, who has moved to a £1.2million mews cottage behind brother Euan’s house in London.

Euan, 30, moved into the £3.6million Grade-II listed townhouse with his wife Suzanne, 26, last year after selling a three-bedroom Georgian townhouse. He owns the property jointly with his mother.

The family also own this mews house in west London. The property was bought in Mrs Blair's name but is thought to be where Euan and his wife, Suzanne, live
