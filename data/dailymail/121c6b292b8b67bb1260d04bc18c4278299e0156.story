We may be more accustomed to seeing her posing in figure-hugging dresses, but even Kim Kardashian isn't immune to the colder weather.

The new mother has been spotted donning an eye-catching bulky furry brown 
ankle-length coat that resembles a giant teddy bear, on not one but two occasions recently.

This modern, oversized Maxmara Carrara coat is made from a blend of alpaca and mohair - and comes with a hefty price tag of £1,560.

But, as ever, Kim is bang on trend with her choice of seasonal outerwear. Ladies, it's time to embrace the teddy bear coat.

Other fashionistas to be joining the trend are former French 
Vogue Editor, Carine Roitfeld, who worked a huge, caramel coloured 
oversized coat by Maxmara over Paris Fashion Week, as well as IT girl Alexa Chung, who received a baby blue Steiff teddy bear coat by emerging designer Isa Arfen as a gift.

With many designers this season heading back towards the fashion 
industry's ever controversial penchant for fur, an equal number headed 
in a new and interesting direction with this offering.

Teddy fur popped up all over the 
AW13 Fashion Weeks, from Nina Ricci and Carven to the super covetable 
(or should we say cuddle-able) collection of furs by MaxMara.

Speaking about the new trend, Toni 
Jones of 30ish Stylist said: 'Teddy bear coats are the ultimate in cosy,
but huge coats have a habit of making the people who wear them look 
huge too.

'The wearer 
needs to remember that this is most definitely a statement coat and the 
rest of the outfit needs to be pared down and as minimal as possible.

'Kim Kardashian got it spot on by teaming hers with black clothes, tights and shoes and slicked back hair.

'Navy,
nude, camel, grey and deep red work too. And don’t forget to 
smile…taking yourself too seriously while dressed as a stuffed toy is a 
very bad look indeed.'

Celebrity
stylist, Jade Elliott, added: 'If you want to rock a hot new trend now 
the weather is turning cold, try a teddy bear coat.

'As
this look is all about the cosy fabric, pick a style that suits you - 
belted or tailored coats will work well if your curvy or pear shape 
while straighter styles suit apples and athletic frames.'
