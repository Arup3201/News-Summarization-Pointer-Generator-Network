Aldi are introducing £9.99 caviar to target their upmarket rivals such as Waitrose 

Caviar has always been associated with the high life.

But now the unlikeliest supermarket is to stock the luxury item on its shelves in the run up to Christmas.

Discounter Aldi, better known for selling potatoes at a bargain basement 69p a kilo, is to sell Beluga caviar costing £9.99 per 20 grams.

The move is part of a plan to step up its battle for a bigger slice of the luxury market as it takes on upmarket rivals such as Waitrose by increasing and improving its selection of goods aimed at affluent consumers.

It comes as plans to open 65 new stores across the country were announced, with the company's sales soaring by 30 per cent to more than £5billion in 2013. 

The change in produce is particularly noticeable in the German-owned chain’s Christmas range.

It will sell fresh scallops for the first time at £4.99 per 240 grams, and fresh dressed crab at £3.99 for two.

There will also be a whole goose at £35.99 as well as a five bird roast (Turkey, Goose, Duck, Pheasant, Chicken, wrapped in bacon ) at £9.99.

Many of these items tend to be in short supply which critics say Aldi uses to lure shoppers through its doors.

These new items are in addition to the fresh lobster at £9.99 per 240g first stocked last Christmas, and whole legs of Spanish serrano ham for £44.99 for 6.5kg which are being stocked again this year.

Aldi made its name with cut-price own-brand household products but now offers a range of upmarket coffees, steaks, olive oils and wine, as well as award-winning champagne and gin.

Its premium range of products saw sales grow 74 per cent as it attracts more middle class shoppers.

It’s success has seen soaring profits and sales as it gains market share from rivals such as troubled Tesco, and Sainsbury’s.

Figures released today show Aldi has beaten all of the big Four Grocers in terms of the rate it is growing profits.

Pre-tax profit jumped 65.2 per cent to £260.9million for the year to December 31, 2013 from £157.9million.

Aldi opened 42 new stores last year and is on course to open 54 this year, with another 60-65 new stores planned to open in 2015.

This will take total UK store numbers to over 600, keeping it on course to have 1,000 by 2022.

It recruited 9,000 new members of staff in the UK in 2013, including more than 291 apprentices and 165 graduates. 

'The company expects to have more than 7,000 new workers in 2014, including 500 in apprenticeships and 160 in graduate positions.

Mr Barnes said: 'In addition to new store openings, we’ll be upgrading existing stores to meet customer demand.

'We’re investing over £600 million in our operations over the next two years to support this growth. 

'This means we can grow while always giving customers the service, value and award-winning quality they expect at Aldi.'

The Aldi group now has more than 7,000 stores across three continents.   

Aldi's history began in a small grocer's shop in the mining town of Essen in Germany opened in 1914 by Anna Albrecht, 

By 1948, her sons Karl and Theo had taken it to four other locations in the country, and in 1954, the first self-service shop was opened. 

The brothers had a falling out in 1960 over whether or not to sell cigarettes in stores, and the brand was split into Aldi Nord and Aldi Sud. 

In 1971, Theo Albrecht was kidnapped for 17 days and held to a ransom of $3million. The Albrecht family has remained notoriously private since.

Karl Albrecht is now in his nineties and was listed Germany's richest man by Forbes last year.  

The brand's name is a combination of the family's and the word discount.  

After branches were opened in America, the first store in Britain welcomed shoppers in 1990. It now has more than 500 across the world. 

Despite the encouraging figures, the chain is suffering along with many of its rivals from the price war it sparked.

Its profit growth is half the 123.9 per cent it achieved in 2012.

This is because Aldi has also been forced to slash its prices to keep ahead of the supermarkets, such as Tesco and Morrisons, which joined it in dropping prices.

Matthew Barnes, Aldi’s joint managing director, said: ‘We are delighted with the 65 per cent growth but yes it is a reduction. We continue to reduce profit margins by investing in sharper prices, but this is more than offset by our economies of scale.

‘We invest in prices to maintain the [price] gap which will have a short term impact on the bottom line. We will remain the price leader. We have reduced them [prices] in line with the market – we won’t let them [rival supermarkets] close the gap on Aldi.’

The drop in price has boosted the number of customers more than one million more than this time last year, increasing total sales for the group by 35.7 per cent to £5.2billion from £3.8billion.

However this too is slower growth than the 40.6 per cent seen the previous year.

The fact that Aldi is also seeing something of a slowdown is a sign of just how tough it is for the grocers at the moment.

New data out last week showed that overall grocery market growth slowed to a  record low of 0.3 per cent as the average basket of everyday goods bought today cost exactly the same as it did a year ago.

Barnes said: ‘It is a tough market out there, spending is going backwards on groceries.’

Aldi is testing a new larger store format at 1,254 square metres and plans to increase its store numbers from 530 to 1,000  by 2021, employing 50,000 staff.
