Middlesbrough are close to clinching a deal to sign Adam Forshaw from Wigan in a deal expected to be worth more than £2million.

Forshaw, 23, will have a medical tomorrow before finalising his move to Aitor Karanka's high-flying side.

Boro tried to sign him last summer but he moved from Brentford to Wigan, a move which reunited him with manager Uwe Rosler and represented a return home to Merseyside.

Rosler’s exit and Malky Mackay’s arrival proved a setback for Forshaw, who doesn't seem to fit in with the Scotsman style of play

The former Everton youngster now finds himself going from a relegation scrap, to a promotion push with the Teesiders.

Wigan seem to be busily offloading players as if they're preparing for the worst. Ben Watson has joined Watford and a number Premier League clubs are chasing winger Callum McManaman.

The Latics struggles are somewhat of a shock as they find themselves languishing second from bottom with only Blackpool below them in the Championship.

Aitor Karanka's side are pushing for promotion and the signing of Forshaw will be a welcome bonus
