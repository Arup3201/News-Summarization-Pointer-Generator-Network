An Irishman couldn't walk into a bar, so he tried to get in through the roof.

It may sound like a bad joke but it turned into an expensive night out for an Irish tourist on the Gold Coast who ended up having to be cut out of the roof cavity.

Hugh McMahon, 18, has been forced to pay $2600 in fines and damages after having to be freed from a roof near the Sin City night club in Surfers Paradise.

Hugh McMahon, 18, got stuck in an air vent while trying to re-enter a nightclub he'd been thrown out of

McMahon was trying to get back into the club via the roof after being kicked out twice, the first time after he was spotted sleeping on a couch inside the popular night spot.

The teenager, in Australia on a 12-month working holiday, broke into the roof space through a sliding door at the Promenade Apartments on Orchid Ave.

He damaged the door's lock in his failed entry bid before becoming entangled in wires and stuck among the pipes and internal struts in the cavity.

During his botched entry McMahon also damaged plasterboard.

He faced court charged with trespass, wilful damage and two counts of refusing to leave a licensed premises.

Magistrate Ron Kilner failed to see the funny side to McMahon's antics, fining him $900 and ordering him to pay a total of $1700 in damages to the building owners and the Queensland Fire Service.

'Drunk or sober, it was an absolutely remarkably stupid thing to have done,' Mr Kilner said.

'You only have yourself to blame.'

McMahon, who plans to return to Sydney on Thursday, has been given three months to pay his fine.
