According to Arkansas law general indignities includes various degrees of intolerable treatment.

It includes the following example list of offenses set down by the Arkansas Supreme Court: ‘Rudeness, vulgarity, unmerited reproach, haughtiness, contempt, contumeliousness, studied neglect, intentional incivility, injury, manifest disdain, abusive language, malignant ridicule and every other plain manifestation of settled hate, alienation, and estrangement’.

Under Arkansas law, Clark also has to provide witnesses that his wife was guilty of such behavior.

Legal experts in the state said general indignities is the most common reason given for divorces. It is comparable to the cause of irreconcilable differences that others states allow couples to cite when filing for a divorce.

The petition states the couple have to settle 'real and personal property rights'

Arkansas is one of the few states where a reason as to be provided to show that a marriage can be ended.

He is said to stay with Mei, 30, when visiting New York

Clark, a former Democratic Presidential candidate, filed for divorce on September 7th 2012 in Pulaski County, Arkansas.

The petition came six months after he met 30 year old fashion executive Shauna Mei at conference in Carlsbad, California. The pair attended a symposium organised by Deepak Chopra. Clark was one of the guest speakers.

They were later photographed together in the same month the divorce petition was filed when they attended the Democratic Party convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Clark is understood to have moved out of the family's $560,000 home in Little Rock, Arkansas, soon after filing for divorce.

He is said to stay with Mei, 30, when visiting New York but lives in a rented condo in Little Rock when in the state.

The divorce is said to have taken his wife, who likes to be called Gert, completely by surprise.

The couple have moved 32 times during their marriage as Gertrude followed her husband loyally around the world on his military postings.

A close friend told Mail Online: ‘Gert is absolutely shattered by the divorce. She never saw it coming.

‘She is a very devout Catholic and the thought of  divorce is abhorrent to her.

‘She has been a loyal wife to General Clark and followed him where ever his career has taken him. She feels utterly betrayed by this.’

Clark and his wife were married in Brooklyn, New York in June 1967, according to the divorce petition.

They had met at a dance in New York while Clark was on leave from military duties.

She was by his side during his unsuccessful bid to gain the Democratic Party nomination in 2004.

During the failed 2004 election campaign Gertrude toured the US with her husband where she spoke glowingly of his military accomplishments.

She told audiences that she was interested in education and health care and was described as “perfectly coiffured.”

Prior to her marriage in 1967 in Brooklyn, New York, she had worked in a bank.

She gave up her career in 1970 when her son Wesley Jr was born. Her husband was serving in Vietnam at the time where he was wounded after being shot four times.

Wesley Jr, a 43 year old film screenwriter who lives in Los Angeles, has refused to comment on the divorce.

The petition states the couple have to settle ‘real and personal property rights’.

Legal
 experts told MailOnline the divorce should have been finalized in May 
but Gertrude and her soon to be ex are in dispute over who gets the 
family home.

‘The divorce has been held up over arguments over the property,’ said a friend.

‘Gertrude is refusing to back down and that is the reason the divorce has not gone through.’

Clark has not publicly commented on his latest personal life.

He is in Aspen later this week as a guest speaker to talk about the role renewable energy plays in national security.

Clark is one of the most respected military men in America.

In 38 years of service the former West 
Point graduate rose to the rank of four-star general as NATO’s Supreme 
Allied Commander, Europe.

He was in charge of US forces during the Bosnian campaign and led NATO forces to victory in Operation Allied Force.

Since retiring from the military in 2000, he has become an investment banker, businessman, commentator, author and teacher.

The new lady in Clark's life was born in Mongolia ad raised in China before emigrating to the US.

She worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs before leaving to venture into fashion merchandising starting her own luxury sale site.

One week after Clark’s divorce was scheduled for a final trial, he and Mei attended the 2013 Apex for Youth Inspiration Awards Gala on May 8.
