The style guide for this year's Royal Ascot has been released - and the spirit of smart dressing that the race course was keen to introduce last year returns for another year.

In 2012 the Ascot unveiled a new list of sartorial rules which included banning fascinators within the Royal Enclosure and forbidding anyone from wearing strapless dresses anywhere in the park.

Now, alongside a brochure detailing the dress-up dos and don'ts of the sporting festival, Ascot organisers have launched a video to remind racegoers how long dresses ought to hang and what sort of top hats gentlemen should be wearing.

Smart and sassy: Suggestions in the brochure include a dress by Karen Millen, shoes by DSquared, bag by Reiss and headband by Miche Dulce, left, and trousers by Gerard Darel, a blue jacket and white shirt by Reiss, shoes by Gina, bag by Nancy Gonzalez and headpiece by Philip Treacy, right

In the Grandstand enclosure women may wear both fascinators and full-length trouser suits, but no strapless dresses, shorts, branded clothing or fancy dress.

Sheer strap dresses and tops are not permitted, and if jackets or pashminas are worn the dresses underneath must adhere to guidelines. Midriffs must be covered.

In the Royal Enclosure rules are even stricter, with women forbidden from wearing fascinators. Hats must be worn at all times, but only 'a headpiece which has a base of 4 inches (10cm) or more in diameter is acceptable'.

The brochure supplied by Ascot suggests designers such as Zoe Jordon, Philip Treacy and Alexander McQueen for women, Reiss, Banana Republic and Gieves And Hawkes for men.

In 2012, 'dress-code assistants' handed pashminas out to women who hadn't interpreted the rules correctly

Spotting displays of outrageous fashion used to be an annual attraction at Royal Ascot, but in 2012 organisers put an end to the trend of shrinking skirts and fascinators by implementing the tough new dress code.

'Fashion
police' were hired to make sure no exceptions made it into the Royal 
Enclosure on Ladies Day, with eagle-eyed 'dress code assistants' armed with a selection of waistcoats, ties, pashminas and other items to help the under-dressed cover up.

The new dress code was announced in January 2012, and organisers sent out reminders with badges and tickets, something which will likely be repeated this year.

Charles Barnett, chief executive of 
Ascot, said at the time: 'Ascot is Europe's flagship race meeting and one of the 
world's greatest sporting and social events.

'We have tried to provide an
appropriate dress code that is clear, workable and in line with the 
wishes of racegoers.

'During the meeting itself, 
our team of special dress code assistants will help people with any 
queries that they may have.'
