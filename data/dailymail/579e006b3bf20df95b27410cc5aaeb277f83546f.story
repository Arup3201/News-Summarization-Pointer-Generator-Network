The body of a missing Pakistani-born model has been found dumped in a ditch out the outskirts of Islamabad.

Fehmina Chaudhry, 27, based in Singapore, disappeared last Thursday while visiting her home country to buy property, local police said.

Estate agent Maaz Waqar has confessed to the murder of supermodel mother-of-two, originally from Karachi, and is in police custody.

Chaudhry went missing last week, after which her mother received demands for money in return for her daughter.

Islamabad police tracked down Mr Waqar, who admitted to murdering the beauty queen after interrogation.

‘Police arrested the real estate broker and after interrogation, he told officers that he had murdered the model and dumped her body in a stream at the outskirts of the city,’ Islamabad police spokesman Muhammad Naeem said.

Miss Chaudhry's promoter in Pakistan, Asif Hashmi, confirmed the death of the model, who was married with a son and a daughter.

‘She was a dedicated philanthropist and she was planning to set up a fashion school in Pakistan,’ Hashmi said, adding that she had won several beauty contests.

The officer leading the investigation, Yasir Afridi, said Chaudhry's mother had contacted her for the last time on the evening of October 10, after which she received a text message saying her daughter had been kidnapped.

‘She used to visit Pakistan often to see her mother and was staying at a private hotel in Islamabad where she came to buy real estate for her mother,’ Yasir said.
