A married couple and mother are feared to have been killed in their own home after a blaze ripped through the property.

Police say the the huge blaze which is believed to have started in the kitchen and killed three members of the same family, is suspicious.

Police and firefighters were called to the £400,000 house and pulled a woman from a bedroom but she died in hospital a short time later of severe burns.

Officers searched the house in the affluent suburb of Heaton, in Bolton, Greater Manchester and found two bodies upstairs.

They are so badly burned by the 2am inferno, it is thought investigators are unable to determine whether the victims were male or female.

Their son Ommid, a doctor, said: 'I can't believe what happened, I'm totally speechless and devasted.

'You don't expect something like this to happen. They were loving people who provided everything for us.

'I would lIke to be left alone to try and come to terms with this news.'

One neighbour who declined to be named said: 'This morning I heard an explosion of some sort and looked out of the window and just saw smoke. My husband dialled 999 and the emergency services were very quick to arrive.

'The smoke came through the house and we could smell it straight away. The Rafies are very good neighbours and they're very family orientated.

'The mother in law had not been very well and she had been staying with them from London. Mona had gone to London to get her and bring her back because she had lung cancer.

'She brought her up here and was staying here because she was going to have treatment at the Christie cancer hospital.

'They were really nice neighbours and looked after us. They used to come and check on the house whenever we were away. We can't believe it what's happened - we are shocked.'

Maria Taylor, 48, said: 'I was woken by the sound of the fire engines and at that point I just saw all the fire and police.

'There was about four ambulances.

'I was hoping that the family were away as there are normally two cars on the drive and when I looked out there was only one.

'I convinced myself that everything was okay because there was only one car there.

'But then I saw somebody being brought out of the house and they were doing CPR on them in the front garden before being taken away in an ambulance.

'The smoke was really thick. They had to break down the door to gain access and use the battering ram to get in and started with the hoses straight away.

The Rafies, who are feared to have died in the blaze, are well-liked and respected in the community

'It's so sad - especially because it is so close to Christmas.

'It looks like the fire has started in the kitchen I went to bed about 11pm and there was no signs of anything wrong, everything looked quiet.

'Hassan used to have a computer business but he has since retired and closed the business.

'They had just had some building work done to the front wall but nothing out of the ordinary. They were a lovely family we are just so shocked.'

Another neighbour: 'They were very very friendly. we heard the fire engines about 2 AM and the police cars and fire engines and ambulances all arrived.

'We saw flames coming out of the kitchen it was awful. They were lovely people and very good neighbours.'

In 2001 Mr Rafie fell victim to an armed robbery at his shop during which a gunman shot at him and a work colleague. He told his local newspaper how he 'stared death in the face' and tried to fight off two robbers with a plank of wood.

He said at the time: 'I was in the line of fire when he shot the gun. I didn't think about myself, I was just worried about my friends.'
