The 2014 Commonwealth Games have been the first to see boxers fighting without protective headgear in a controversial move by the International Boxing Association.

The IBA last year ruled to stop the use of headgear in male bouts, citing medical experts who said it would help reduce concussions.

The organisation said medical studies showed wearing headgear diffused blows to the head and allowed boxers to sustain more head shots - and potential brain damage - for longer periods of time.

England boxing team leader John Hallam
 said he has only heard positive comments about the move, which will not
 affect female fighters and younger boxers.

But its critics include British pro George Groves, who said last year: 'They need the protection headguards give at this stage of their careers. I get paid to get hit in the head. These kids don't.'

Today,
 south London super-heavyweight Joe Joyce guaranteed at least a bronze 
medal for England after pummelling Scotland's Ross Henderson to defeat 
in Glasgow.

Joyce 
clubbed Henderson to the canvas four times and forced five standing 
counts before the referee had seen enough and waved off the contest in 
the dying seconds.

It was an
 emphatic performance from the European bronze medallist who will face 
Uganda's Mike Sekabembe for a place in the final later this week.

Joyce said: ‘That's one more down and two more to go. I've fought him twice before and I knew he'd come forward having a go so I knew what I needed to do.

‘Obviously I want to go in and finish him off, but I don't want to go in and catch a shot on the way in so had to stay switched on and watch out for the big hook to the jaw.’

Motherwell's flyweight firebrand Reece McFadden also guaranteed a medal after beating Botswana's Oteng Oteng via a unanimous decision.

It was another confident performance from McFadden who had already beaten world number one Andrew Selby and England's European bronze medallist Charlie Edwards.

McFadden boxed in a much more controlled manner, mindful of a cut he sustained above his left eye in the first round.

McFadden said: ‘That was the toughest fight I've had so far and I knew I just had to hold it in and especially when I got the cut.

‘I'd like to think I can cope with the pressure, I definitely feel like I'm getting closer and there's no reason that gold shouldn't be mine.’

Northern Ireland's Ruari Dalton failed to book a semi-final meeting with McFadden when he was outpointed by Australia's Andrew Moloney in the quarter-finals.

England's Natasha Jonas crashed out of the women's lightweight competition after a split-decision loss to Shelley Watts of Australia.

Jonas took an early lead in the contest but struggled to repel her opponent's busy challenge in the three remaining rounds and came up short.

Two judges scored the bout a draw and the third found in Watts' favour, and Jonas had no complaints with the verdict.

Jonas said: ‘I think the nervous energy got to me a bit but I'm an experienced athlete and there's no excuses. I'm in the shape of my life but the better person just beat me on the day.’
