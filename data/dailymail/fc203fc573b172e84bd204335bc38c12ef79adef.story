A woman prepares for bed: Many people find that the preparation portion of getting ready for bed is part of what makes them relaxed and sleepy

Millions of adults get in to their night clothes as soon as they get in from work, a study has revealed.

Researchers found one in ten adults in Britain put on their pajamas immediately after they arrive home from work. 

The poll also found the typical Brit slips on their sleepwear attire at precisely 9.11pm.

The hotel chain polled over 2,000 adults on their sleepwear habits and revealed that just under half the nation are at their happiest when lounging around in their pyjamas.

With nearly a quarter of the nation admitting to having spent the entire weekend in their PJs on more than one occasion.

The survey revealed British women have opted for a more laid back approach to their sleep attire, with 17 per cent of the women polled admitting to wearing an 'old' nightie or just a t-shirt.

Only one in twenty women opt for a pretty nightie or camisole set, whilst 18 per cent of the men polled wear pyjamas and the rest choosing to wear just boxer shorts and a t-shirt.

It seems that the women polled had good intentions when they first met their partner to wear more attractive sleep wear, but on average, eight months into the relationship women become more relaxed and replace their pretty camisoles for scruffy pyjamas.

An honest 39 per cent of the females polled said they are past caring what their other half thinks of their sleep wear.

The study also found that 30 per cent of men would reject a woman who wore a floor length nightie to bed.

Other bedtime garments that were off limits in the bedroom include a cartoon character night shirts and an old football shirt.

Women also revealed that novelty boxer shorts, pyjamas with characters on and striped pyjamas were also deemed a no-no.

All tucked up: British folk, as it turns out, are incredibly particular to their sleeping garments, and many see them as a link to their prospective partner's personality

In fact, the only time we tend to make an effort in our night attire is when staying at a hotel with 34 per cent of respondents admitting to taking their best nightwear if they are staying away from home.

A further one in five go out and buy brand new sleepwear if they have to stay in a hotel.

And quarter of those said it's because it's usually a special occasion and a paranoid 15 per cent said they want respectable nightwear in case they get spotted by hotel staff.

A spokesman for Premier Inn said: 'We think it's great Brits have a casual and laidback approach to their nightwear. 

'For many, it is the only time you can be safe in the knowledge that no one will be concerned about what you're wearing and most importantly, feeling comfortable in your sleeping attire is certain to help towards a great night's sleep.'
