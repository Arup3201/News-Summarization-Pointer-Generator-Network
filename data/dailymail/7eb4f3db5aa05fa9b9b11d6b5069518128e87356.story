It's the awkward moment television co-host Karl Stefanovic decided to steal a baby from the crowd - and the little boy's reaction is priceless.

Stefanovic and his fellow Today show hosts are in New York  as the Channel Nine breakfast program broadcasts from Times Square this week.

But being away from his own three children obviously caught up with Stefanovic as he decided to pluck a baby from the crowd and claim it as his own.

Today show co-host Karl Stefanovic had an awkward run-in with a baby as he filmed his breakfast television show on-location in New York's Times Square on Thursday

His co-host Lisa Wilkinson wasn't the least bit surprised.

'We've been away from our families this week, this is day four and I knew it wouldn't take long... Karl has stolen a baby,' she told the crowd of people gathered behind them.

Stefanovic joked that 'some of us have American families' as he showed off ginger-haired baby to the cameras.

'Who's a little baby?' he repeated several times in a high-pitched voice, as the baby stared back with a bemused expression

But what followed was an awkward exchange between the television larrikin and little Aiden from Sydney's Blue Mountains.

'Who's a little baby?' he repeated several times in a high-pitched voice, as the baby stared back with a bemused expression.

It didn't take long for Stefanovic to crack up laughing, before deciding to hand the baby back it his mother.

In another rather awkward moment for theÂ Today show hosts, Lisa was left as the only one busting a move when Karl simply opted to hold a microphone as the pair were joined by one of the world's best choreographers.

J-Lo's creative director Frank Gatson, who was trying to show them how to shake it like 'Jenny from the block', said the star's performance of her hit 'Booty' for Fashion Week last night was inspired by legendary choreographer Bob Fosse.

While Lisa seemed to put in a bit of effort and showcase some of her best moves to J-Lo's 'work' and 'shake that', Karl seemed more worried about what he was doing with the microphone, holding it for a demo dancer as well as singing.
