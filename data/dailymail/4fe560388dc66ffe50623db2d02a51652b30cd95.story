A woman's body was found on Friday in a garage and two other bodies were found on Saturday - one in a nearby backyard and the other in the basement of a vacant house.

Is this the face of a killer?: Registered sex offender Michael Madison, 35, has been arrested in connection with the discovery of three bodies in East Cleveland, OH

Spotts told volunteers searching the neighborhood's vacant homes to be alert for the smell of rotting, the AP reported.

Police said the three bodies found were female, but they do not yet know the identities of any
 of the victims or the cause of death. All of the women were black and 
each body was wrapped in four or five plastic bags. The bodies have been
 sent to the coroner's office.

All
 three women are believed to have been killed in the last six to 10 
days but are decomposed to the point that the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner told media Sunday that determining 'identification and final cause of death may take several days' and will be made available as soon as possible.

Madison was arrested after a two-and-a-half hour standoff with police on Friday.

East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton said that Madison said during police questioning that Sowell might have inspired the killings and told investigators there may be more bodies.

'He said some things that led us to believe that in some way, shape, or form, Sowell might be an influence,' Norton told the AP.

Police connected Madison to the murders after one of the bodies was found next to a car he was driving, according to WOIO. The suspected killer was arrested at his mother's house a short distance away after a two and a half hour standoff.

A man in prison with Madison during the alleged killer's four-year sentence for attempted rape told WOIO that Madison admired Sowell. Madison served time from 2002 to 2006 after agreeing to a plea deal for attempted rape after being charged with attempted rape, gross sexual imposition and kidnapping with sexual motivation in connection with a 2001 attack on a local woman, according to court records.

'He was not stable,' Brandon Trussell told the station, adding 'yeah, he said he respected him.'

Madison was charged with possession of, preparation for sale and trafficking of cocaine after a 2000 arrest, according to court records. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison, but it is unclear how much time he actually served  on this charge. The sentence ran concurrent with the six month sentence he received for a 1999 drug possession arrest.

He was then arrested again in 2001 for attempted drug possession and sentenced to another 12 months in prison before being arrested only three months later for attempted rape, records show.

The first woman to be found was described as 5'3 and 110 pounds, according to Cleveland.com.

A
 second victim was discovered 150 feet from the carport where the first 
victim as found. She was in a lot with heavy weeds. Norton said she had a
 tattoo of a pink flower with green leaves on her left thigh.

The third woman was found in a basement of a vacant house adjacent to the overgrown lot.

Norton told The Plain Dealer it appeared that woman, who was wearing a purple top with a leopard print pattern, had been thrown through a window into the basement.

All three bodies found were wrapped in several plastic bags in the fetal position, officials said.

Police are still searching other vacant houses in the neighborhood for other possible victims.

'I don't know if there are anymore bodies out there,' Norton told the newspaper. 'It is all tying back to the same guy.'

The neighborhood is reeling from the discovery.

'Something like this is very upsetting to me, to my kids and to my grandchildren,' Bernadette Bass told WOIO.

Another woman knew the suspect after having to keep him away from both her daughter and cousin.

'It's very scary, especially when he used to be talking to my daughter," Nathenia Crosby, 48, told the AP. 'But I told him he was too old to be talking to my daughter because she was only 19. When I found out how old he was, I said, 'You need to move on, she's too young.'

Known as the 'Cleveland Strangler,' Anthony Sowell was discovered by police after a woman escaped his house during an attempted rape.

During trial, it was revealed that Sowell raped and strangled 11 women June 2007 to July 2009 and then hid their remains around his Cleveland home.

Sowell's victims were all recovering or 
current drug addicts aged 24 to 52, the killings were so brutal that 
prosecutors called him 'the worst offender in the history of Cuyahoga 
County and arguably the State of Ohio. He was sentenced to death and is currently in prison.

This is the third high-profile case in Cleveland, Ohio, involving the disappearance of women off the streets of the city.

The charges against sex offender Michael Madison comes just two months after a  woman missing for a decade escaped from a run-down Cleveland home, 
saying she and two other women had been held captive there for years.

Former school bus driver Ariel Castro was later charged with nearly 
1,000 counts of kidnapping, rape and other crimes. The three women 
disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and 
20 years old. Each said she had accepted a ride from Castro, who 
fathered a daughter, now 6, with one of the women. He has pleaded not 
guilty and is jailed on $8 million bond.

Anthony Sowell was arrested October 31, 2009, after police investigating a woman's report that she had been raped at his house began finding bodies. Eventually, the remains of 11 troubled women were discovered. Prosecutors say that the victims began disappearing in 2007 and that Sowell lured them to his home with the promise of alcohol or drugs.

The victims were disposed of in garbage bags and plastic sheets, then dumped in various parts of the house and yard. Sowell was convicted in 2011 and sentenced to death in the women's murders. He now sits on death row.

Police, the FBI, the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department went through yards and abandoned houses in the area where all three bodies were found. They used dogs trained to find cadavers. The search ended around 11 p.m.

This weekend's discovery is just the latest in a series of horrific acts uncovered by local police in recent years.

Ariel Castro, a retired school bus driver in the Cleveland area, was found in May to have been keeping prisoner three women who vanished more than a decade ago. Officials have levied almost 1,000 counts of rape, kidnap and torture against him after alleging that he routinely chained and raped them, even fathering a child with one of the victims. Castro was also charged with two counts of aggravated murder after he allegedly punched one of the women, causing the unlawful termination of a pregnancy.

Dishwasher Charles Ramsey famously freed the women after seeing victim Amanda Berry trying to pry open a door in a home across the street from his, making him an instant celebrity.

No charges have yet been filed against Madison, police declined to provide a further update when contacted by MailOnline.
