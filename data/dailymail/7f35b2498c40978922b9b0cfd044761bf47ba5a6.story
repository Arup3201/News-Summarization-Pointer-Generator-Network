It was her simple gesture that Les Misérables star Anne Hathaway found so heartrending. The woman was speaking falteringly about being forced into prostitution in order to feed her children when she broke down, weeping uncontrollably. Then, as if to hide from the shame, she raised a hand to cover her face.

In that briefest of moments, Hathaway knew she had found the inspiration for her role as Les Misérables’ tragic heroine Fantine, who resorts to selling her body for the sake of her daughter.

Hathaway said: ‘I just said to myself, that’s who she is. She exists; this won’t be an inventive performance. She’s living in the world right now and I must do the reality of the suffering justice by telling the truth.’

Indeed, the 30-year-old’s empathy with the unidentified woman inspired her to give a performance so remarkable that it has been described as ‘magnificent’ and a ‘tour de force’.

Two harrowing scenes in particular reveal why her portrayal has been hailed by critics: in one she sings the musical’s most famous and haunting song, I Dreamed A Dream, and in the other her hair is cut off live on camera.

There was a lot riding on the critical reception of the film, which opens in UK cinemas on Friday.

Based on Victor Hugo’s powerful novel about poverty and revolutionary spirit in 19th Century France, Hathaway was taking on a role which has been played worldwide by some of theatre’s most established singers.

Yet the actress, who has described portraying Fantine as a ‘dream’, more than justified the faith of British director Tom Hooper, who cast her over hundreds of better qualified musical actresses.

Hooper says he was entranced by the way Hathaway sang in close-up. 

Her intensity was in part due to having been fascinated by the musical since the age of seven, when

she saw her actress mother, Kate, performing in it on stage.

This emotional connection helped Hathaway to throw herself into becoming Fantine with a passion that was unnerving. 

She insisted on her own hair being cut off for the role and, despite Hooper’s best efforts to dissuade her, went on an extreme diet to shed 25lb from her already slender frame and attain the emaciated look of the tuberculosis-stricken heroine.

Hathaway also spent months on her own meticulous library research and would turn up on set carrying binders stuffed with historical papers.

However, it was watching a current affairs programme on prostitution that truly inspired her virtuoso performance in the film, which also stars Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Amanda Seyfried.

‘There was one woman who kept saying, “I come from a good family,  I come from a good family.” I just heard the heartache of loss in her voice,’ Hathaway explains.

‘She doesn’t know how her life got where it was. After having lost everything, she needed to feed her children. She burst into tears while she was talking. And not just tears, it was soul-racking sobs.

‘I’ll never forget, even though her face was [pixelated] to maintain her privacy, how she raised her hand to her forehead. It was the most heartbreaking gesture of despair I had ever seen. So, I didn’t leave myself an option not to go there, because to do anything else would be denying the truth.’

It was this desire for authenticity that prompted her decision to have her own locks shorn for the scene in which Fantine sells her hair to buy food for her child.

abroken woman. ‘When I got the role, I had an inherent empathy for the character and a feel for it and a desire to tell the truth in playing her.’

Yet, she almost changed her mind about her hair at the last minute and found that the tears she was required to shed during filming flowed naturally. ‘I was very scared the day we were going to do it. I was sort of regretting offering the option to Tom [Hooper]. I was shaking.

‘After it was done, I looked in the mirror and burst into tears. I realised that I couldn’t take it back. It changed my identity  .  .  .  I was inconsolable. I didn’t think I was that vain.’

However, the dramatic cut turned out to be a shrewd move, enabling her to channel her sadness at losing her auburn locks into the scene, and also giving her a sophisticated new look.

Hathaway has always been canny about her career decisions. In the 12 years since she burst on to the scene as a fresh-faced, haphazardly dressed teenager in The Princess Diaries, she has worked hard to be taken seriously.

Her profile grew steadily thanks to a starring turn in The Devil Wears Prada in 2006 and a steady stream of roles in hits such as Brokeback Mountain, Becoming Jane and Alice In Wonderland.

Yet, after years of playing wide-eyed ingenues, Fantine represents a breakthrough role for the actress, capping a year in which she has turned 30 and married actor-turned-jeweller Adam Shulman.

She is hotly tipped to receive the Best Supporting Actress Oscar at next month’s Academy Awards.

Explaining the personal significance of the role, Hathaway recalls being enthralled when her mother Kate performed in the musical.  

‘I was seven when I first saw the stage production. My mother was playing the factory girl and  different members of the ensemble. I can remember that pretty well.

‘The whole story was very real for me. It never felt musical or like it was a group of actors playing a group of characters. I felt for them so deeply, even though I was very young.’

The evening her mother stepped in as an understudy to play Fantine is etched on her memory.

‘I really do think that was the night my soul fused with this music. Never knowing, of course, that it would come back and enter my life in the way that it has. I always kind of thought that this was [her mother’s] role and untouchable, but when I found out that it was the only one I was up for, I just thought OK great, then I want to play Fantine.’

Her commitment to the character has, in turn, had a profound impact on her personal life. She was so happy in the company of Shulman, then her boyfriend, that she struggled to evoke the misery she needed to project as Fantine.

‘He walks into a room, and I light up. I can’t help it,’ she says.

So, a few days into filming, she made the heart-wrenching decision to tell him they had to be apart during filming. Yet there was never a time when she didn’t believe they were destined to be together.

‘I knew from the second I met him that he was the love of my life,’ she gushes.

The couple started dating in November 2008, just five months after the end of her disastrous romance with Italian businessman Raffaello Follieri.

Hathaway broke up with Follieri, her boyfriend of four years, days after he was arrested on fraud and money-laundering charges.

Hathaway’s diaries were seized by FBI agents looking for evidence, but she did not face any charges.

Follieri, who was subsequently convicted and recently released after four years in a Pennsylvania prison, has since claimed they were about to get engaged when he was arrested.

Hathaway maintains a dignified silence, choosing instead to focus on her happy new life.

She reveals that her wedding to Shulman was influenced partly by her dramatic hairstyle change. He was so shocked when he saw her new look for the first time that he blurted: ‘OK, without giving anything away about what is coming in the next few months, how do you feel about being a short-haired bride?’

They were married in a secret ceremony in Big Sur, California, last September, after filming had ended. 

Hathaway’s gown, which she wore with a white headpiece and veil, was designed by Valentino.

With her career and personal life at an all-time high, Hathaway is thinking about motherhood.

‘I have wanted to be a mother since I was 16,’ she says. ‘But I also wanted to have a career, so I have been chomping at the bit to be a mother for a really long time. I also had to find a baby daddy first.’

Now that she has the right man, she is planning a large family.

‘I’d like to have as many as I can afford, not just financially but in terms of time, because you want to make sure that each one feels special. I’d like to have a few naturally and adopt.’

First, though, she is set to star in Steven Spielberg’s sci-fi thriller Robopocalypse.

And before that is the announcement on Thursday of this year’s Oscars nominations.

Should she go on to win the award as widely expected, amid the jubilation and glamour Hathaway will no doubt reflect on the fate of a desperate, unnamed woman whose selfless sacrifice and palpable  suffering spurred her to give the performance of a lifetime.
