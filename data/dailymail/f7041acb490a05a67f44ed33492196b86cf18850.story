A couple made their adopted teenage daughter to wear a shock collar around her neck which transmitted an electric charge as a punishment method, U.S. authorities have reported.

Investigators said the 15-year-old girl from Butler in Georgia, was also made to live in a chicken coop.

The collar was discovered at the home of the girl's guardians Diana and Samuel Franklin and the couple were arrested on Tuesday morning, according to WTVM.

Accused: Authorities reportedly say that Diana Franklin, left, and husband Samuel were arrested on Tuesday and are expected to face charges of cruelty to children and false imprisonment

The girl told Georgia Bureau of 
Investigation (GBI) agents that her parents shocked her with the collar 
several times using a remote key fob.

GBI's Wayne Smith told WSB radio in Atlanta: 'The child basically said that there 
were just a series of fairly severe, what can be described as 
punishments, for various things that the child allegedly did â€” some as 
simple as not doing homework and then others like taking food.'

The collar, which usually used on dogs, is now being tested by forensic experts for DNA matches, and reports say it matches the description that the teen gave to agents.

Diana Franklin is facing 12 counts of cruelty to children and four counts of false imprisonment, while her Mr Franklin is facing eight counts of cruelty to children and eight counts of false imprisonment.

Investigators first started looking into the case at the end of May after receiving tip offs that the girl was being mistreated.

Neighbours reported seeing the girl carrying out hard manual labour tasks.

Steven Bails said: 'I've seen her out working in the gardens, digging ditches in the hot sun with two or three older boys watching her.

'I've seen her toting rocks up the road - she looked like she was in rough shape.'

Another neighbor said Diana Franklin told her she was 'doing what the Bible says' when she disciplined her daughter.

The neighbour, who did not give their name told WTVM that the mother would only feed the teen bread and water for days as a punishment.

A custody hearing for the teen is due to take place today with the District Attorney taking it over when the criminal investigation is completed.

The girl has been in temporary custody of the Department of Family and Child Services for the last few weeks.
