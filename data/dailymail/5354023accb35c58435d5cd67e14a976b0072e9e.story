Locked up: Maksym Shynkarenko, pictured in 2004, traded tens of thousands of explicit images

A Ukrainian man who authorities said could be the most significant distributor of child pornography ever prosecuted in the U.S. has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.

Maksym Shynkarenko, who was arrested in Thailand five years ago and extradited to the U.S. two year ago, secured a plea deal in Newark, New Jersey in January for running a network of websites that catered to pedophiles around the world. The 35-year-old will likely be deported when he is released from prison.

'You have pleaded guilty to one of the most serious crimes imaginable in our culture as human beings,' U.S. District Judge William Walls told him on Tuesday. 'I can't think of anything more horrific.'

Shynkarenko, who wasn't involved in the production of child pornography but traded tens of thousands of hardcore images and videos, spoke briefly in court on Tuesday.

'I want to just say I regret my crime, and I am grateful for the chance to change my life,' he said.

Shynkarenko traded pictures and footage that depicted children ranging from infants and toddlers to teenagers being graphically sexually assaulted or abused, his indictment showed in 2012.

He and his associates advertised the websites with names such as 'Illegal.CP,' 'The Sick Child Room' and 'Hottest Childporn Garden'.

The U.S. attorney's office said the investigation into a website that Shynkarenko operated between 2005 and 2008 has led to the criminal convictions of more than 600 U.S. residents across 47 states.

The investigation was initiated after 
agents from the Newark division of U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, found the website through
 emails sent from a computer in Long Branch.

Sick: An investigation into one of the websites that Shynkarenko operated between 2005 and 2008 has led to the criminal convictions of more than 600 U.S. residents across 47 states, authorities said

'Shynkarenko worked the supply side of a market that sells images of the most depraved, predatory abuse of children,' U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said.

Walls said he wouldn't oppose a request by defense attorney Nicholas Wooldridge to have the three-and-a-half years Shynkarenko was jailed in Thailand deducted from his 30-year sentence.

But the judge rejected Wooldridge's argument that Shynkarenko deserved a greater reduction because of the deplorable conditions of Thai jails.

Wooldridge characterized Shynkarenko as a 'smart guy' who earned a degree from a technical college in Ukraine and who used his knowledge of computers to run the network of websites described in the indictment.

He said Shynkarenko wasn't involved in the production of child pornography.
