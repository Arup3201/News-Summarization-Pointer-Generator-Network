A top Egyptian politician has sparked outrage by cheekily asking a journalist live on air if her questions would be 'as hot as she is'.

Minister of Information Salah Abdel Maksud was caught on camera asking Dubai TV news show host Zeina Yazjy the 'inappropriate inquiry' during an interview last week.

He said: 'I hope your questions won't be as hot as you.'

Furore: Egyptian Minister of Information Salah Abdel Maksud sparked outrage after he told Dubai TV news show host Zeina YazjyÂ  'I hope your questions won't be as hot as you'

Without hesitating, and retaining her calm, she replied with a smirk by saying: 'My questions may be hot but I am the opposite, I'm very cold.'

The interview then continued, reported Spanish newspaper ABC.

Maksud is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the political and religious party currently in power under President Mohamed Mursi.

Hundreds of Egyptians took to Twitter to condemn the right-wing politician's comment, which they deemed 'inappropriate' and 'out of place'.

Many said it was 'hypocritical', seeing as his Islamist-dominated government last month lifted a ban on female news presenters in Egypt wearing a veil.

The ban, enforced by state television for the half century it has been in existence, ended when Fatma Nabil read out the headlines wearing a cream-coloured headscarf and a dark suit.
