A widower who buried his wife's body in their front yard in accordance with her dying wishes has told a judge that he will follow a court order and remove it.

James Davis, 74, told Jackson County 
Circuit Judge Jenifer Holt during a hearing in Scottsboro, Alabama on Wednesday that he would 
comply with an order she issued last year.

'I'm gonna take Mama up and have her cremated and keep the remains in the house,' he said.

Davis had previously vowed to never remove the remains of his wife, Patsy Davis, after promising her before her death in April 2009 that he would bury her just yards from their front porch.

He maintained the city shouldn't be able to force him to remove the grave, which is marked with a headstone and decorated with plants and flowers, from his longtime residence in Stevenson.

But he has now conceded defeat and said he will hire a contractor to remove the body of his wife on Friday and will then have it cremated.

Davis said the exhumation and an urn would cost $2,745, and the judge also ordered him to pay $678 for a legal transcript the city said it needed.

The couple both grew up in Dayton, Tennessee, and first met when she was seven and he was 11 and he asked her to accompany him to a strawberry festival.

'We went on that one date, and it was me and her the rest of the time,' he said. They were married for 48 years and had five children.

In her later years, his wife suffered crippling arthritis, and Mr. Davis retired from his job as an electrical worker to take care of her until her death in April 2009.

Shortly
before her death, Mr. Davis said, she expressed her wish to be buried 
in the yard of the house where they had spent three decades together.

The
City Council rejected Davis' request for a cemetery permit for his yard
after his wife died, but he buried her a few feet from the front porch 
anyway.

The city sued to
make Davis remove the grave, arguing that laws prohibit people from 
using their yards as burial grounds inside the city limits, and a judge 
last year ordered Davis to move the remains to a licensed cemetery.

The Alabama Supreme Court recently refused to intervene in the case, and Holt held the hearing to determine how the exhumation would occur and how the costs would be covered.

Outside court, Davis said he, his children and grandchildren were 'at ease' with the decision to remove the body and have it cremated.

'They can't hurt us anymore in this thing and there's been so much hurt, so much hurt,' he said.

City attorney Parker Edmiston said the 
town tried to work with Davis, offering him two plots in the town 
cemetery for Patsy and himself, but the man refused to cooperate.

'He said it was easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, and that's what he did,' Edmiston said.

Davis' attorney, Tim Pittman, and Edmiston agreed that the body, casket and burial vault would be removed and the grave refilled immediately, but Davis said he would not move the stone tombstone that has marked the grave.

Edmiston said a city ordinance prohibits markers like the tombstone at homes, 'but that's an issue for another day.'

Davis said he had dropped a plan to declare his house a church so he could keep the grave as is.
