Roma gipsy Elisabeta Dano's refusal to work spurred a crackdown on benefits tourism

Wrapped up warm for a day out in town, this is the Roma gipsy whose refusal to work has spurred a crackdown on benefits tourism.

Elisabeta Dano, 25, has found herself at the centre of a landmark European case, which has apparently given Britain the green light to block welfare claims from migrants who refuse to work. 

But while the courts – and her own family – insist she must now get a job, Dano yesterday declared: ‘It is unfair’.

The Mail tracked down Dano to a high street apartment in the German city of Leipzig, 120 miles south of Berlin. 

The newly married mother – whose husband is also unemployed – moved four years ago from Romania to Leipzig, where her sister Cristina had already relocated with her husband and five children.

Dano is a convicted criminal who has never worked a day in her life but has been given a State-funded flat and a range of benefits.

The European ruling this week, however, means she cannot claim welfare benefits intended for jobseekers because she has made no effort to find employment in Germany. 

The judgment suggests the UK can, similarly, refuse to pay welfare benefits to migrants who have moved to Britain simply to live off the State.

Dano insists she does want to work and is unemployed only because she cannot get a work permit.

Speaking as she waited for a tram into the centre of Leipzig, she told the Mail: ‘I came here to babysit for my sister who has five children, but now the children are older I’m not needed as a babysitter any more. I then tried to get a job, but was told I needed a work permit. I applied several times but I was never granted one. It is unfair.’

Dano completed just three years at school in Carei, a small town of 20,000 residents close to the Hungarian border in north-west Romania.

She has a five-year-old son, Florin, whose father is unknown. She has no professional training, has never worked, and was sentenced to two years on probation for petty theft while living in Romania. Despite living in Germany since November 2010, she can speak only basic German and can barely read, write or do basic sums.

Her sister, Cristina Mihai, said she was desperate for Dano to start supporting herself. ‘I wish my sister would get a job. Anything. Cleaning, yes. I can’t bear the situation any more.’ 

The European Court of Justice ruled that national governments can limit access to jobless benefits

Dano was apparently given a flat in central Leipzig for her, her husband and her son so she could move out of her sister’s apartment. At the apartment in a smart block above a bank, Dano’s husband said he did not understand what the fuss was about.

The European ruling is seen as a boost to the British Government’s welfare reforms and means EU countries do not have to pay jobless EU migrants who emigrate looking to live off state handouts. 

But critics say the case simply shows that not enough is being done to stop migrants emigrating for handouts – because Dano is still entitled to other benefits.

Dano receives £145 a month in child benefit and £105 a month in ‘maintenance’ payments, which she will continue to get from the State.

She also applied for ‘basic provision’ benefits worth £300 a month to jobseekers. The local job centre refused this application so Dano appealed to a social court and the case was referred to Luxembourg. 

This week, the European court rejected her appeal, declaring that rights of free movement depend on migrants not being an ‘unreasonable burden’ to the host country.
