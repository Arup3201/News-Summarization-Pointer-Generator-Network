The country retreat that jazz legend George Melly bought after selling off part of his prized art collection has gone on sale for £650,000.

The hard-living musician parted with a Picasso drawing, a Klee watercolour and a Magritte oil to buy the converted medieval tower with its own stretch of the River Usk. 

The flamboyant performer, known for his fedoras, loud suits and louder ties, used the Welsh hideaway to indulge his passion for fly fishing and spent many family holidays there with his wife, Diana, and their children.

George Melly sold off part of his art collection to buy this country fishing retreat in village of Screthrog near Brecon, Mid Wales

When the infamous hellraiser, best known for his distinctively growled jazz vocals, was not in residence at the 14th Century listed building, known as 'The Tower,'  his wife, Diana, ran it as a bed and breakfast.

The jazzman owned the property between 1971 and 1999.

In the late 1990s the three bedroom property  in the secluded village of Screthrog near Brecon, Mid Wales,  became too much and Melly sold it. 

Up until then the hard living singer regularly performed at the nearby Brecon Jazz Festival.

Melly died aged 80 at his London home in 2007 from lung cancer and emphysema.

George Melly sold the property in the late 1990s when it became too much for him and his wife, Diana. It is now on the market for £650,000

He was born  in Liverpool in 1926, and was educated at Stowe public school where his love of jazz began.

Melly joined the Royal Navy before making his name with Mick Mulligan’s band.

After quitting music in 1962 to concentrate on writing, he resumed his jazz career in the 1970s and went back on the road with John Chilton's Feetwarmers. 

The musician was the author of three volumes of autobiography in which he wrote frankly about his bisexuality and drinking. Melly talked about his life as a fisherman in his book Hooked that was published in 2000.

He also lectured on art history and wrote the script for the Flook cartoon strip in the Daily Mail.  

The jazzman continued performing live on stage until his death. His final concert took place at the 100 Club in London  in aid of Admiral Nurses, part of the charity For Dementia in June 2007.

Estate agents Knight Frank are now seeking a new buyer for the property and grounds which are on the market for £650,000.

A spokesman for the estate agents said: “The Tower stands on a man-made mound, it has thick walls, deep windows and a beautiful winding stone stairway, the remains of the original moat can be seen from all of its spacious bedrooms.

“The grandeur of its immaculately persevered original features and modern improvements have created an elegant and welcoming family home from this historical Grade I building.”

George Melly enjoyed many family holidays at the property, where he was pictured  in June 1982 with his wife Diana
