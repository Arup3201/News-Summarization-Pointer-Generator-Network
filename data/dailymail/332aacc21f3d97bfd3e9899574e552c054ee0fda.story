Most running races require a degree of speed, but even those who trailed in last in this fun-run found they took longer tying up their shoelaces than they did completing the course.

Every single one of the 390 athletes who entered the World's Shortest Fun Run in Burntwood, Staffordshire, got to the finishing line - with the fastest taking just seven seconds to complete the course.

Now organisers say they hope they have set a new Guinness world record with their 55-yard long race.

Pace yourselves: Nearly 400 people entered the 55-yard race around the tiny Prince's Park in Burntwood, Staffordshire

A minature Darth Vader, a couple of Elvises - the miniature fun run resembled a marathon in everything but size

Prince's Park measures just 15ft by 30ft - barely the size of a traffic island - but is officially the UK's smallest park

The course involved a loop of what is officially the smallest park in Britain: the diminutive Prince's Park in Burntwood, Staffordshire.

Everyone in the field, ranging in age from three months to 93, successfully completed the triangular course, and they managed to raise more than £750 for local charities as they did so.

The 150-year-old park sits at the centre of a road intersection, and despite its size, boasts a wrought-iron perimeter fence, three trees and a memorial bench.

Kevin Wilson, of sports organisers KP Events, said Bank Holiday Monday’s race had been a big success.

He said: 'We had a good turnout and they all got going around the park - which is just 55 steps in total.

'Everyone got dressed up and treated it like a normal race.  We're now waiting to hear from Guinness that they have recognised it as the world record.'

Hundreds turned out to watch the runners in what organisers hope will be crowned the shortest fun run in the world

Competitor Sharon Grey, 21, from Lichfield, said: 'It was nice to see the community get together around the park.  We don’t notice it’s there any more but it was nice to be reminded we’ve got such a unique landmark on our doorsteps.'

The park was created to commemorate the marriage of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales and Princess Alexandra of Denmark in 1863, and the three trees are named Faith, Hope and Charity.

All proceeds from the race were donated to the We Love Lichfield charity, which has raised more than £150,000 for local voluntary groups.
