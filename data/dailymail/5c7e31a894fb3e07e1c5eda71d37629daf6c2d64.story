A devil tattoo could help identify the remains of a man whose dismembered body parts were found floating in a river.

Police released the image after a forearm - severed at the elbow and wrist - was spotted floating in the Maribyrnong River in Melbourne by diners at a nearby restaurant  on Thursday afternoon.

Part of a limb and a black plastic bag of human flesh were found further upstream when police divers searched the area.

Detectives continued searching the river by boat on Friday morning and will focus on a bridge about two kilometres from the restaurant where the forearm was spotted. 

Missing person records are now being scoured by police as the body parts undergo forensic testing. 

Police say they hope a picture of the devil tattoo found on the inner forearm will help identify the man. 

'It was really deemed to be suspicious when a second body part was found,' homicide squad detective Senior Sergeant Stuart Bailey told the ABC.

'I'm not sure exactly what part that is, we do know it's a limb but certainly seeing we've seen a second body part, we do believe it's suspicious.' 

It isn't clear how long the body parts had been in the river or where they were dumped.

'The examination that'll be conducted by the pathologists we are hopeful will assist in that regard,' Sgt Bailey said.

'We've looked through missing persons records and there's nothing obvious to us at this point in time.'
