Fears: Lord Coe talking to The Mail on Sunday

Olympics chief Sebastian Coe has launched an out­spoken attack on reality TV, warning that it could wreck Britain's hopes of producing future Olympic champions.

Lord Coe, who won his first Olympic gold in 1980, said shows such as The X Factor encourage young people to think they can become 'famous for nothing'.

The chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Locog) said: 'I don't decry all reality TV. It identifies talent, but it encourages people to think you can be a celebrity in six hours.

'I joined an athletics club when I was 11 years old and didn't get to the Olympics until I was 23.

'We have to be careful we don't create a celebrity-driven culture where young people think it is better to be famous for nothing than be anonymous for doing something creative.'

In an exclusive and wide-ranging interview with The Mail on Sunday, Lord Coe - who remains the only man to win gold in the 1500m at successive Olympics - also spoke candidly about his 'tough' school days and the extra­ordinary influence of his late father and coach.

Sleek and slim as ever at the age of 55, wearing a pink shirt with the top two buttons open and reclining in his 23rd-floor office in London's Canary Wharf, Lord Coe looks the archetypal, well-groomed City slicker.

Yet he failed his 11-plus and his was no gilded upbringing. 'If you were brought up in Sheffield in the Seventies, went to an inner-city secondary modern and your name was Sebastian, you learned how to survive. It was tough. You learn to handle yourself.'

His steely core comes as much from his formidable father Peter as it does from his native city. During the Second World War, Peter Coe survived his ship being torpedoed.

Picked up by a German boat, he later escaped en route to a prisoner-of-war camp by leaping off a train and walking across the Pyrenees to Spain. But there he was jailed for six months for having the wrong papers.

Years later, he had a blazing row with a bolshie athletics official and his son commented: 'You don't scare easily.'

Peter, who died in 2008, replied: 'I don't scare at all. The last 43 years have been a f****** bonus.'

When Coe lost the 800m Olympic final to his great rival Steve Ovett in 1980, his father told him - and the world's media - he had 'run like a ****'.

Unlike modern budding Olym­pians, Lord Coe's only sponsors were his hard-up parents.

'It bred a hardier competitor,' he says. 'No athlete is going to under­perform in London because of lack of funding. The National Lottery has changed the landscape.'

The words are said with feeling. However, he admits today's youngsters have more distractions.

'When I first joined an athletics club, it was the focus of my world. There was little TV and no computer games.'

Lord Coe also touched on the possibility that sprinter Dwain Chambers, whose ban on competing because of a drugs offence was overturned earlier this year, could wear a GB vest at the 2012 Games.

'I am unreconstructed on this,' he says. 'I would like to see a life ban. If you take drugs to artificially enhance your performance, you are stepping out of the moral framework of sport.'

Athletes on drugs who competed for the Soviet Union in Lord Coe's heyday had an excuse, he says. 'They had no idea they were being given drugs at the breakfast table.'

Of Chambers, Lord Coe says: 'If he competes he should receive every courtesy.'

But he warns: 'Drugs cheats should think very carefully before coming to London: we have the most advanced tests in any Games. You run a serious risk of getting caught.'

Turning to Britain's chances this summer, Lord Coe is far from confident about achieving the target of finishing fourth in the medals table, as in Beijing, when we nudged Australia into fifth place by a single bronze medal.

'You don't have to give the Aussies much of an excuse to get back at you. It's in their DNA.' He says the Germans, French, Japanese and South Koreans pose the biggest threat.

Lord Coe's steely core is again evident in his defence of his £357,000-a-year salary as Locog chairman.

Lord Coe, who travels in a chauffeur-driven BMW 7 Series, says he is worth it: on a typical day, he starts work at 7am and finishes at midnight.

He also defends the ruthless way 'Olympic police' have stopped anyone else exploiting the Games' commercial potential. An East End kebab shop called 'Olympic' was forced to change to 'Lympic'.

'I am unashamedly protective of it,' he avows. 'I have to protect the people who have put a lot of money into this. I am going to get this project across the line with a balanced budget so the public won't have to pick up the bill.'

Rumours: Lord Coe's judo sessions with William Hague fuelled bogus rumours they were gay

Lord Coe was a Tory MP from 1992 to 1997 and William Hague's chief of staff when the former Conservative Party leader was defeated in the 2001 General Election. He became a peer in 2000.

His spell with Hague is best remembered for their lunchtime judo sessions, which fuelled bogus rumours that they were gay.

'Gay?' splutters Lord Coe, in fits of laughter. 'There was nothing weird about it. When William became leader, he said to me, 'I know how hard this job is going to be. I need to be in shape. What do I do?' I said, 'What sports do you like?' He said, 'Martial arts.''

Lord Coe arranged for them to wrestle on the judo mat, supervised by Olympic silver medallist Ray Stevens. 'William got up to a blue belt.'

Lord Coe has four children by ex-wife, equestrian Nicola McIrvine, and had an affair with fashion designer Vanessa Lander in the Nineties.

He married magazine editor Carole Annett, ten years his junior, last July.

His friends say his ambition is to be president of the International Olympic Committee. Lord Coe plays it down but, like the canny politician he is, does not rule it out.

If London 2012 goes well, his credentials will be as unbeatable as he was on the track.
