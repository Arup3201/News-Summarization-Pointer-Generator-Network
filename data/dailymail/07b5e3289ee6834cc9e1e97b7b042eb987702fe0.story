World No 19 Steve Stricker has withdrawn from next week's Open Championship and been replaced in the field at Hoylake by first reserve Ryo Ishikawa.

Stricker has played a much reduced schedule in recent seasons and also opted not to compete at Muirfield last year, choosing to celebrate his 20th wedding anniversary instead.

Speaking during last month's US Open, Stricker said he was undecided about making the trip to England.

'Ask me 
tomorrow, I could be going, ask me another day, I could be going home,' 
he said. 'I'm leaning toward not going. I'm thinking about throwing in 
Greenbrier and then the John Deere (Classic). It's a long trip and I'm 
not too fired up about it. But then I look at it, and it's a major. And I
 should be going there.'

England's Ross Fisher is now first reserve ahead of Canada's David Hearn.
