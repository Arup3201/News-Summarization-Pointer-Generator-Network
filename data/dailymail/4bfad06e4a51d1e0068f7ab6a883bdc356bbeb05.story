How does any self-respecting celebrity spend Christmas? By telling the world about it on  Twitter, of course.

For Coleen Rooney, the celebrations involved raiding the dressing-up box to turn herself into Dorothy from The Wizard Of Oz.

The 26-year-old posted a photo yesterday of herself with three-year-old son Kai as the Scarecrow.

Whether or not her footballer husband Wayne, 27, joined in the fun in quite the same way is unclear.

Nigella Lawson also appeared keen to sport a different look. The raven-haired TV cook wore a blonde wig as she held up a sign reading ‘Happy holidays!’ in a snap she uploaded to her page.

On another site, Instagram, Sports Personality of the Year Bradley Wiggins posted a photo of his seven-year-old son Ben grinning as he proudly shows off his Christmas present of a  racing bike – perhaps not surprising, given his father’s phenomenal success at the Tour de France and the Olympics.

And on the Prime Minister’s official Twitter page, Larry the No 10 cat was pictured sprawled out in a Santa hat.

The posts were among a series of ‘Merry Tweet-mas’ offerings to be found littering the social networking site, where the rich and famous seemingly can’t stop themselves from sharing snapshots of their lives... no matter how bizarre or, for that matter, mundane.

Another Olympian, Tom Daley, got into the swing of things in more traditional Yuletide attire. The 18 year Olympic high diver wore a Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer t-shirt as he posed by the Christmas tree.

Pop singer Leona Lewis tried to go the trad route too in casual sweater and jeans by the tree... but her slightly glum expression suggested little festive cheer.

Family: Tennis champion Andy Murray's mother Judy posted a picture of her son enjoying Christmas day with his relatives

Her chart rival Rhianna, meanwhile, opted for a Santa hat teamed with camouflage vest and shorts - relatively demure for her, considering her penchant for posting revealing snaps on Twitter.

Over at the Murray household, things looked to be considerably tamer, with tennis hero Andy relaxing on the sofa with his brother and sometimes double partner Jamie.

Their mother Judy Murray posted the picture along with the message: ‘Murray Christmas. The bros get new scarves.....Happy Hibees!! :)’ - a reference to the soccer-loving pair’s support for Hibernian FC, nicknamed ‘the Hibees’.

Over at No 10 Downing Street, it was a laid back time for Larry the cat too - David Cameron’s ‘Chief Mouser’ was pictured sprawled out in a Santa hat.

Gary Lineker was feeling a right Twit too... after forgetting to switch the oven on for Christmas dinner with model wife Danielle.

He posted a picture of the stone cold, raw turkey they were faced with on his Twitter page. The Match of the Day host Tweeted: '2 hours in the oven and still the turkey is cold. Helps if you put the oven on right? My only job. Oops!'

Chelsea footballer and his girlfriend Christine Bleakley also posted a picture of themselves posing in front of a Christmas tree.
