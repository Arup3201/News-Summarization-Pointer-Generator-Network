As half of the singing duo Simon & Garfunkel, Art Garfunkel has been described as having one of the greatest voices in pop.

Alongside songwriter Paul Simon, his angelic tones on hits such as Bridge Over Troubled Water, The Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair and Mrs Robinson helped to turn them into one of the most popular singing duos in the world.

So when Garfunkel suffered serious vocal chord problems four years ago, leading to the loss of his trademark sound and cancellation of the duo’s 2010 tour, you might have expected Simon to have been supportive.

‘He wasn’t particularly. But no, I’m not upset,’ says Garfunkel tersely. He pauses, then adds: ‘But I’m used to the fact that we’re just different characters.’

The duo may have harmonised exquisitely on stage but their 60-year relationship off it — they met at junior school and were trying to broker a record contract together by the time they were teenagers — has been stormy.

You can ask Garfunkel, 72, about anything — his friendship with Jack Nicholson, his love affairs, even the suicide of an ex-girlfriend — and he will answer. It is only when the topic of Paul Simon crops up that the temperature starts to chill slightly.

They broke up spectacularly, and very publicly, in 1970, soon after the release of their seminal album Bridge Over Troubled Water. Simon is said to have resented his dependence on Garfunkel to interpret the songs he wrote, and Garfunkel resented Simon’s resentment. There was a row over a tour.

‘That was our worst-ever fight,’ says Garfunkel. ‘After all that shouting we called it quits.’

They have reunited to perform and even tour together several times over the decades since, but Simon said recently that he will never record with Garfunkel again ‘because that would be revisiting the past’.

Garfunkel once said that his relationship with Simon ‘causes me far more pain than my relationships with anybody else I could name’, although now he demurs.

‘Did I say that? That doesn’t feel right, although I guess we are deep old friends, and when there’s depth there, there’s going to be shade as well as light.’

When Garfunkel was pursuing a successful solo career in 1979 — his single Bright Eyes, from the film Watership Down, was the UK’s biggest seller that year — his girlfriend, 25-year-old actress Laurie Bird, committed suicide.

The couple had been together for several years and Garfunkel took the loss hard. During performances of Scarborough Fair, Bird would often come to his mind.

‘Especially when I sang the line Remember me to one who lives there / She once was a true love of mine,’ he says.

‘I don’t feel the loss as palpably as I did years ago, but the first four or five years were life-stopping. I was very introverted in the Eighties. I stayed at home and communed with my memories and Laurie’s diaries, and read Dylan Thomas and Yeats.

‘I went all “high artist” on myself and couldn’t face the world.

‘Then I started hanging out with Penny Marshall. She’s a great film director and actress who’s just so light and funny that she helped bring me out of myself. We had a million laughs, the sex was good and it got me out of my introversion. We’re still friends, but I’m a married guy now — my heart is elsewhere.’

These days Garfunkel’s heart belongs to actress and singer Kim Cermak, 56, his wife of 25 years.

Of the 16-year age gap between them, he says: ‘It doesn’t seem to bother us at all and, actually, I love that she’s younger than me. There’s a nice amount of differentness between us: I’m urban and she’s Midwest; I’m much more cerebral and she’s way sweeter than I am and free of a lot of my thorniness. We slip together pretty naturally.’

It’s his second marriage. His first, to architect Linda Marie Grossman, ended in the Seventies after just three years.

He and Kim have two children — James, 23, who is also a singer (‘he’s better than me and sings higher than I do!’) and eight-year-old Beau Daniel, who was born via a surrogate.

‘We wanted a second child and I sometimes wondered if it would ever happen. But it finally did 15 years later, which is lovely and  very unusual.

‘At my age, it was a wonderful shot of new life and I can say to all daddies who are getting on in years, it’s spiritually and poetically magnificent to have a child later in life.

‘Now that I’m older, the godliness of a child speaks powerfully to me. In my 20s I was chasing the charts and the fun of artistic projects, and in my 30s I was self-involved. It was only once I hit my mid-40s that I realised it wasn’t all about me and that life was about giving life.’

Garfunkel’s pursuit of artistic projects wasn’t limited to music. After recording the soundtrack to the Mike Nichols film The Graduate, which included the 1968 hit Mrs Robinson, both Garfunkel and Simon — who went on to marry actress Carrie Fisher — began to harbour acting ambitions.

Nichols signed the duo to act in his 1970 movie adaptation of Joseph Heller’s novel Catch-22, but Simon’s minor part in it ended up on the cutting-room floor. That Garfunkel was given fourth billing was said to be another factor in their parting.

In 1971, Nichols put Garfunkel into Carnal Knowledge, co-starring with Jack Nicholson as college room-mates. ‘We became buddies,’ Garfunkel says. ‘He’s not the frivolous man people think he is.

But those were fun times and fame was a big kick. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!’And the best part of fame?

‘The girls were a big thing,’ he says after a moment’s reflection, ‘because suddenly you’re not such a loner and not so different from everyone else.’

Growing up in New York, that incredible voice initially set him apart from the other kids.

‘I started singing in echoing apartment block stairwells when I was five and I knew I was different from a very young age,’ he says. ‘I was a loner and I was lonesome.

‘Then I met Paul Simon at  school when I was 11. He was another guy who loved music. Finally, I felt understood.’

And for all their ups and downs, it’s that memory that remains.

‘Forget the other stuff,’ says Garfunkel gently. ‘This is what Simon & Garfunkel is all about.’

Could the pair ever work together again? ‘Well, we don’t speak that often, but I think the world of him as a great musician and an interesting cat,’ he says carefully. ‘But it takes two to tango. We’ll just have to see what chance brings.’

Garfunkel — minus Simon — will be touring the UK in September. While the hair might not be the blond halo it once was, his honeyed tones are still much in evidence.

‘When I had vocal problems for a few years, I’ll admit I didn’t know how to be me,’ he says. ‘It’s a real thrill to have my voice back and to shape this new show.

‘There are three parts to it: I’ll sing and I’ll be doing some of our old hits; I’ll read some things I’ve been writing for the past 30 years; then I’ll answer questions from the audience. I try to be candid and it’s nice to share all these memories. I mean, ain’t I a lucky duck?’* Art Garfunkel’s UK tour starts on September 5. Tickets on sale now from livenation.co.uk
