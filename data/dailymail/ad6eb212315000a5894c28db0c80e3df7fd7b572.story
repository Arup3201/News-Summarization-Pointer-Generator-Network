Drama: Christine Keeler, played by Charlotte Spencer, with Stephen Ward (Alexander Hanson)

Time to can that cliche about Andrew Lloyd Webber being middle-class twee. His slick new musical has F-words, drug-dealing and a silver-service orgy involving a bare-buttocked aristocrat in a gimp mask and a pinny. Who does he think he is? Channel 4?

Some scenes in Stephen Ward have a projected image of a big chandelier thrown high on central drapes. It is a surprise some trouserless Sybarite is not swinging from it with his floozy, even while singing one of those classic Lloyd Webber reprises a semi-tone higher than its predecessor. 

Ward (played by Alexander Hanson) was the Mayfair osteopath who in 1960 introduced War Minister John Profumo (Daniel Flynn) to sexpot Christine Keeler (Charlotte Spencer). His circle also included a vodka-swilling Soviet diplomat, Eugene Ivanov (Ian Conningham). Did the minister betray secrets? No, sings Christine. In his ‘lust, warheads were not much discussed’.

But Fleet Street’s finest went into orbit. Profumo was finished, the Tory Government fell and the unfortunate Peter Pan (or deluded pimp?) Ward killed himself.

Most dramatic art demands the suspension of disbelief. This fiery polemic argues, all too convincingly, that Ward was a ‘human sacrifice’ in a ‘political revenge trial’.

A political revenge trial? Biased judges and warped lawyers? In Britain? It could never happen now!

Moving on sharply before we  prejudice any current trials, this grown-up, richly produced, strongly scored musical has a timeless  topicality. Bent coppers, lying  parliamentarians, a bed-hopping elite and grubby newspapermen. We haven’t changed much in  half a century. 

One drawback is that the Profumo story is over-tilled soil. Another is that this sex-for-larks episode was so lacking in innocent romantic love. The exception was the steadfastness of Profumo’s wife Valerie. Her forgiveness of her husband gives the show its best tingle moment, Mrs Profumo (Joanna Riding) singing ‘I’m Hopeless When It Comes To You’.

That moving song and a zippy number called ‘1963’ – a ‘Hey There Georgy Girl’ soundalike sung with perhaps too much aggression by Christine and her friend Mandy Rice-Davies (Charlotte Blackedge) – sound the best bets for posterity.

The central melody, much repeated, begins with an octave leap and has a meandering descent. It, too, worms its way into your head. The mocking march ‘You’ve Never Had It So Good’ (echo: ‘You’ve never had it so often’) is also catchy, even if the joke was pinched from an early issue of ‘Private Eye’.

Praise: This is a powerful musical not about revolution but about defeat and decay and it is well worth seeing

The show starts with hypnotic woodwind as Ward’s ghost steps out of the Madame Tussauds Chamber of Horrors (Blackpool branch). His waxwork image has been placed here alongside acid murderers and Adolf Hitler. ‘I never expect this,’ he admits. 

Soon we are in the haunts  familiar to anyone who knows the Profumo/Keeler story: Murray’s night club, where Christine was a dancer. And the Wimpole Mews house where Ward and Keeler set up (platonic) home.

Christine and Profumo meet by the pool of Lord Astor’s stately home, Cliveden. We do not see the water but its ripples are cleverly reflected from behind a wall. Miss Spencer and Mr Conningham strip, he doing some pleasing comedy while hiding his crown jewels.

Director Sir Richard Eyre has drilled his troops well. There is a completeness to this show. You sense you are in the hands of master craftsmen.

Did composer Lloyd Webber have to rummage around in an increasingly empty tune box? That would be a harsh judgement.

This is, however, the work of an artist in his later phase, both shadowed staging and the music being brushed by a sceptical world-weariness rather than the vaulting, full-lit optimism of innocence. This is a powerful musical not about revolution but about defeat and decay and it is well worth seeing.
