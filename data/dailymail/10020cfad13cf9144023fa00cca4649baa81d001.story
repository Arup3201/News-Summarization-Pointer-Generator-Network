Wilfried Bony finally broke his Africa Cup of Nations duck, as his two goals put the Ivory Coast into the semi-finals of the competition.

Before Sunday night, Bony had not scored since becoming Africa's most expensive footballer last month, and the Manchester City man struggled for form so far at this tournament, finding chances hard to come by, and even harder to take.

But against the tournament favourites he twice headed his country in front, the second coming from a cross by his new team-mate Yaya Toure.

In between Hilal Soudani had levelled things up, keeping his calm to finish from close range after Riyad Mahrez had taken advantage of some dreadful defending.

But the Ivorians withstood heavy pressure from the tournament favourites, before a last-minute Gervinho strike sealed their passage to a last-four clash with DR Congo.

After a slow start, when the first opportunity fell Bony’s way in the 26th minute, he could scarcely have asked for a simpler task.

Max Gradel, the Ivorians’ player of the tournament so far, put a cross into the box for Bony to attack, and the Algerian defence simply stood and watched as the Manchester City striker met it.

Rais Mbolhi in goal, rather like his team-mates, put more effort into appealing for offside than stopping Bony from scoring, so by the time the big forward headed the ball he was six yards out, unmarked, and with a keeper standing still with his hands in the air. For the Premier League’s top goalscorer in 2014, it was unmissable.

Algeria hit back through Soudani, but Bony rose brilliantly at the near post to head Toure’s free kick home and keep his side on course for their first Cup of Nations title since 1992.

Following both goals Herve Renard’s side sat deep and invited the Desert Foxes onto them, playing an organised game and using their pace on the break.

Algeria have struggled to break down organised defences all tournament, and the Ivorians proved an obstinate nut to crack.

Yacine Brahimi sweezed between defenders on the left hand side early on to cause slight panic in the box, but when Sylvain Gbohouo flapped at the ball it wouldn’t fall kindly for Soudani.

It was actually the Elephants who looked more likely to score when they got on the break, both Gervinho and Gradel causing Faouzi Ghoulam problems down the right wing. Neither winger could find much end product, but while their defence kept the Algerians at arm’s length, it looked like being enough.

However the north Africans came out strongly at the start of the second half, and a long ball over the Ivorian defence saw Gbohouo inexplicably charge out of his goal.

The ball broke to Mahrez who found Soudani in the six-yard-box. The striker – the only man in the Algerian starting line-up born in the country, with the rest French-Algerians – kept his cool to smash it home.

Buoyed by their goal the Algerians pushed on, and Soudani should have had a second, but his shot from point blank range was brilliantly saved following Feghouli’s scuffed shot across the face of goal.

Bony’s goal brought an even more concerted effort from the Desert Foxes, but they rarely looked like scoring.

Ghoulam came the closest to forcing the game to extra time with a freekick that forced Gbohouo into a fine save, while Liverpool’s Kolo Toure produced an excellent block late on.

But the Ivorians held on, with Gervinho calmly converting a counter-attack deep into stoppage time, and they must surely now be the favourites for a major title that has thus far eluded the ‘golden generation’.
