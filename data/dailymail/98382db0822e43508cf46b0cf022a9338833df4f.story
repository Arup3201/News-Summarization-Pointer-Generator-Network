A heartbreaking mystery has finally come to an end for the family of a California mother who has been missing for eight years.

Azita Nikooei, who worked as a stripper in Bakersfield, vanished in September 2004. While she was presumed dead, her body had never been found.

Police suspected foul play after she never showed for a custody exchange with her ex-husband for their young son, something those closest to Nikooei said she would never do.

Saga: After Azita Nikooei, left, disappeared, fiancé Nathan Mowers, right, was considered a person of interest, but cops didn't have enough evidence until earlier this year, when he confessed

Since Nikooei disappeared, her fiancé 
Nathan Mowers was considered a person of interest, but investigators 
didn’t have enough evidence to connect him to the crime.

Though he originally claimed to have nothing to do with Nikooei’s disappearance, police did not believe Mowers’ story.

Nikooei’s friends told officers that the two often fought, and their arguments often turned violent, according to The Bakersfield Californian.

He finally admitted earlier this year as part of a plea deal that he strangled Nikooei during an argument at their home and dumped her body in the Mojave Desert.

Bones were found on two separate occasions several years ago - but were only recently confirmed to be those of Nikooei.

Police said the bones were extremely bleached, which indicates they'd been exposed to the elements for a long time.

KBAK reported that the first bone - a right femur - was found in the desert in 2008 by miners scouring the area for gold.

A year later, a left human pelvis and femur were found by other gold miners in the area.

Though he originally claimed he had nothing to do with her disappearance, Mowers admitted to strangling his fiancée as part of a plea deal earlier this year.

Mowers was sentenced to 11 years in prison for voluntary manslaughter in February.
