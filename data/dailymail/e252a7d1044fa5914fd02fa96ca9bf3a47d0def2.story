As first days go, it was not what Greig Laidlaw had expected. As he walked through the doors of Gloucester Rugby Club, the man who had signed him, Nigel Davies, had long since headed in the opposite direction. 

Indeed, the Scotland international needed to seek out his new boss to make his introductions.

On top of that, the versatile half-back was also having to deal with some significant changes in his family life, as he made the move from Galashiels to Cheltenham with wife Rachel and month-old baby son Ruary.

‘Add into that a few sleepless nights and it was maybe not the easiest starts to my time at Kingsholm as there was a lot going on,’ admitted a smiling Laidlaw, who has hardly had time to catch his breath since his move south from Edinburgh Rugby over the summer.

‘It was busy times, moving clubs, houses and dealing with a new-born while it was hard on Rachel as she was away from her family with a baby.

‘Players will tell you it is never easy moving clubs and, in my case, there were maybe a few other things to take into account.’

Some may have struggled under such pressure, especially as Laidlaw was trying to impress a coach he hadn’t even met before he turned up for that first day of training.

But, to his credit, Laidlaw, who joined Gloucester after seven years at Edinburgh, has displayed remarkable strength of character to take everything in his stride.

On Friday night, he will start his third match in a row as his new side take on Exeter Chiefs and is growing in stature with every passing game.

The Scotland star had signed a pre-contract agreement with Gloucester back in March when Davies was in charge. However, the Welshman was sacked as director of rugby three months later after the West Country club finished a lowly ninth in the Aviva Premiership.

Suddenly, Laidlaw’s position had changed dramatically, with there being no guarantee he would fit into the new man’s plans.

Former Ulster head coach David Humphreys took over but as he moved to Kingsholm when Laidlaw was on Scotland duty in the USA and Canada back in June, their paths didn’t cross.

Then Australian Laurie Fisher, who Laidlaw had never met, was appointed below Humphries as head coach, which made pre-season training more of a ‘getting to know you’ experience than he ever expected.

‘You always have to prove yourself match by match but the changes meant maybe I had to do it again for the new coaching team,’ said Laidlaw. ‘Although I hadn’t met Laurie before I arrived at the club, he has been fantastic — as has David — and things are going really well.’

Davies had viewed Laidlaw as a stand-off rather than a scrum-half — but it’s at No 9 where the Borderer feels more comfortable and has earned most of his 31 caps.

‘Nigel did mention I would move to stand-off when I first signed but I always told him I was a nine who could cover at 10 — that situation hadn’t been resolved by the time he left,’ said Laidlaw. ‘It would have been interesting to see where I would have been playing if Nigel was still here but I’ve had chats with David Humphreys and Laurie Fisher and they want me as a scrum-half.

‘If that hadn’t been the case, it would have been a bit of a worry for me when it came to Scotland but fortunately I am starting at nine for Gloucester.’

Part of the reason for Laidlaw being used at scrum-half is because the new coaching regime has brought in the 67-times capped Welshman James Hook to play 10.

Their half-back partnership got off to a rocky start in their first league match as Gloucester lost 53-6 away to Northampton Saints, with Hook and Laidlaw putting over a penalty each.

The pressure was, therefore, on them in their first home game last weekend against Sale Sharks but both players stepped up to the mark. The Welsh international ran the show, with Laidlaw kicking 19 points as Gloucester won 34-27 in a thrilling match played in front of more than 13,000 fans.

‘Knowing that James had signed for Gloucester after me came as a nice surprise as it helped me see where I fitted into the picture at the club,’ said 28-year-old Scot. 

‘I feel our partnership is developing well and Hooky is an easy player to play alongside. He is incredibly skilful and has the boot on him to put us in the right areas, which is vital in this league.’

Laidlaw feels it is too early for him to compare the standard of play in the Premiership to the PRO12 but the one big difference is the atmosphere at matches.

‘I am not against the PRO12 but the way the Premiership is supported means there are no small games,’ he said. 

‘For instance, at our first game against Northampton at Franklin’s Gardens there was 14,000 people. We lost that match but still there were around 13,000 at Kingsholm for our match against Sale Sharks and our game against Exeter Chiefs is nearing a sell-out.

‘I always thought of Gloucester as a big club and it’s lived up to expectations. The crowds are fantastic and what the club means to the people is similar to what the traditional clubs in the Borders mean to the locals back home.

‘The atmosphere week in, week out gets me excited and hopefully that, along with the competition for places at Gloucester, will drive my game forward.’

As Laidlaw is just beginning a new life in England, he doesn’t want to get too far ahead of himself in terms of the 2015 Rugby World Cup — but, at the back of his mind, he has that ambition.

‘Scotland’s first match in the World Cup against Japan will be at Kingsholm and it would be great for me to be involved in that,’ he said. 

‘That would be an amazing experience but I am trying not to think that far ahead. Play well for Gloucester this season and maybe I can make that happen next September.’
