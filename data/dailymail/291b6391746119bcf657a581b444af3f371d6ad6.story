British workers have been 'displaced' from the jobs market by migrant workers – especially during the recession, a controversial Whitehall study claims.

A fierce row has broken out inside the Coalition over a Government report on the economic impact of mass migration.

Newsnight on BBC2 claimed on Tuesday that the still-unpublished document would undermine the Tory Party's case for imposing stricter controls on workers from overseas.

The Corporation said that, as a result, it was being 'suppressed' by Downing Street – with pro-immigration Lib Dem MPs demanding its immediate publication.

But the Mail now understands that the study – written by civil servants in the Home Office, Treasury and Department for Business – will clearly state that some Britons have suffered 'displacement' from the jobs market. It says this has been particularly noticeable for 'low-skilled natives', especially during the last recession.

Last night, the row led to renewed claims of the BBC having an 'habitual lack of impartiality on the subject of immigration'.

Its own executives have repeatedly admitted to the Corporation that they had a pro-immigration, liberal bias in the past – but insist that has now changed. The dispute centres on two studies on the impact of immigration.

The first was published in 2012 by the independent Migration Advisory Committee, which was established by the last Labour government and is run by the respected economist Sir David Metcalf. The second, unpublished, report was commissioned by the Government two years ago as part of William Hague's EU 'balance of competences' review.

Despite being focused on Brussels, the Whitehall study also deals more broadly with the impact of migration on the jobs market.

The MAC report found that for every 100 extra foreign-born working-age migrants in the UK, there was a reduction of 23 in the number of Britons in employment.

The report added that, between 2005 and 2010, 160,000 people in the UK had been 'displaced', or left jobless, by the influx of foreign workers. In a broadcast on Tuesday evening, BBC Newsnight reporter Chris Cook said of this research: 'There's just one problem: it's wrong.'

He said the Government's own unpublished report would contradict MAC's findings, and that it was being suppressed as a result.

But as the Corporation's own political editor Nick Robinson conceded yesterday, the Government's study deals with a different time period to MAC and the two are 'not directly comparable'.

MAC's report covers the period to 2010. Whitehall's report brings the subject up to date. Since 2010, restrictions on non-EU migration introduced by the Government have led to an increase in the number of British workers getting jobs.

UK nationals accounted for 92 per cent of the total rise in employment in the year to July-September 2013. Under Labour, the lion's share went to foreign-born workers.

Insiders suggest that, far from undermining the case for immigration controls, it suggests the new regime is working.

In any event, the Government's report – due to be published 'shortly' – does confirm the 'displacement' of British workers by mass migration, particularly the less well-off. As well as running on Newsnight, the immigration story dominated early BBC news bulletins yesterday.

Radio 4's flagship Today programme highlighted the story in a discussion between presenter John Humphrys and the BBC's political editor Nick Robinson.

Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch said: 'The BBC's enthusiasm for anything that might undermine the Government's immigration policy was demonstrated yet again by the excitable tone of Newsnight's report.'

He said the programme had claimed the new report 'undermined the Government's case for restricting immigration.' Writing for the Spectator magazine, he added: 'In fact, this is only one aspect of a much wider case concerning the impact of mass immigration on public services, housing and transport – not to speak of the social impact.'

The row comes at a time of high Coalition tensions over migration policy. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said figures that show net migration rose by a third to 212,000 in the year to September 2013 was 'good news'. In Whitehall, the finger of blame for the selective leak to Newsnight was being aimed at the Business Department.

David Cameron's spokesman said the Whitehall report was not yet  complete but would be published 'shortly' – possibly by May. Asked whether the PM thought it right now to drop his ambition to reduce annual net migration below 100,000, the spokesman said: 'No. It is the objective which we are very much working towards.'
