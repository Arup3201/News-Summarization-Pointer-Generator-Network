Johanna Konta was the first British player to complete a match at Wimbledon this year - and the first to crash out, losing in three sets to Shuai Peng of China.

Peng’s victory, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, took two hours and 15 minutes, sparking the start of a spate of early expected British exits at precisely 2pm.

Konta, 23, is an Australian-born player of Hungarian descent who became a British citizen two years ago. She is ranked No 96 in the world and was expected to lose to a player ranked 35 places higher - although put up a fight on her way out.

Playing out on Court No 12 in opening-day sunshine, Konta took the initiative early to break her opponent to love in the opening game. But she was immediately broken back, and by the end of the first set was nervous and over-cautious.

A double-fault at game point, 40-30 up and serving to save the set highlighted that, and then Konta received a time violation warning for slow play. That marathon game included eight deuces but Peng prevailed when Konta netted a forehand.

Konta started brightly again in the second set, again breaking Peng to love in the opener. This time she capitalised, breaking again for 3-1 before taking the set. But Peng was steadier and on the big points, more clinical.

Konta goes home with a first-round loser’s cheque of £27,000. This is her third straight first-round defeat here following losses in 2012 and 2013.

At full stretch: Peng had to work hard but eventually prevailed against the plucky Brit

Despite working closely with a sports psychologist, Konta admitted she failed to fend off the Wimbledon jitters.

'In the first set she handled the occasion much better than I did,' she said.

'I was playing with a little nerves, a lot of tension, I felt. Obviously when you play like that, you can't play at your best level.'

Konta added: 'Obviously this game is very much mental.

'I am working with a sports psychologist, she's helping me a lot with how to handle situations, and that's obviously a work in progress.'

Konta said it was tough to keep the positive aspect of breaking into the top 100 world rankings in mind in defeat.

'I'm not sure if it's consolation,' she said. 'Obviously it's a small milestone for me, so obviously I take a lot of pride in that, am very happy about that.

'But obviously that's not my main goal, I'm very much looking forward, wanting to keep moving forward.'
