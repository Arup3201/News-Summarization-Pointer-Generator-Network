Nottingham Forest have signed Scotland international winger Chris Burke, 30, on a two-year contract. Burke turned down a contract with Birmingham City.

He said: 'There's no doubt that this is a Premier League club playing in the Championship. I listened to what the manager had to say and what his ambitions are and I really liked what we spoke about.

'In the end it was a no-brainer for me.'

Huddersfield Town have signed Forest midfielder Radoslaw Majewski on a season-long loan deal.
