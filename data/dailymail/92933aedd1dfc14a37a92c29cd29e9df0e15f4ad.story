Being a global superstar, it seems, is no guarantee people will know who you are.

Rihanna might have sold more than 30million albums worldwide, but when her alleged stalker appeared in an American court, the judge found himself rather confused as to her identity.

On being told that homeless Kevin McGlynn, 53, was ‘arrested for stalking Rihanna’, veteran New York judge Abraham Clott admitted he had no idea who she is.

He simply asked: ‘Who?’

Rihanna might have sold more than 30million albums worldwide, but when her alleged stalker appeared in an American court, the judge found himself rather confused as to her identity

McGlynn appeared in court for the first time on Friday to face the two charges of stalking and one of harassment, but was in such an agitated state he was unable to enter a plea or be granted bail and has been kept in custody so a psychiatric evaluation can be carried out.

McGlynn is accused of threatening the singer – real name Robyn Rihanna Fenty – in three notes dropped off at her rented $14.5million New York apartment on July 8 and 11.

The letters repeatedly called the singer a ‘b****’ and said McGlynn would break-in to the property.

He also allegedly sent at least four letters to her California home.

In court, he accused Rihanna, 26, along with rappers Jay Z and Kanye West of stealing his ‘material’ and branded Judge Clott a ‘liar’ when told he could not defend himself.

Rihanna was said to be scared for her safety after reading the letters that reportedly allude to a personal relationship that does not exist between the pop star and the homeless man.

Police traced McGlynn through his benefits card, which he had dropped in Rihanna’s building, and he had been caught on CCTV.

He already has a criminal record, including four arrests for trespassing.

He is due back in court on September 2 but if his psychiatric evaluation finds him unfit to stand trial the charges could be dropped and he would be admitted to a hospital for treatment.
