Celeste Corcoran says she prayed for death as excruciating pain ripped through her body in the first chaotic seconds after the initial bomb went off at the Boston Marathon.

But Celeste's husband, Kevin Corcoran, refused to let her go. 

He tore off his belt and wrapped it around one of her legs, making a tourniquet, then asked a stranger for his belt to stop the bleeding from her other leg.

'I just wanted to die,' Celeste, 47, recalled in an interview with Natalie Morales of NBC's Today Show. 'The thought was there  because I was in so much pain. And then I just remember thinking - I can’t. I can’t. I don’t wanna leave my family... There’s still too much to do.'

Meanwhile, Celeste and Kevin's daughter, 18-year-old Sydney Corcoran, was lying on the ground with dire wounds to her leg. She had become separated from her parents in the blasts. 

Two strangers rushed to help her - one created a tourniquet around her injured leg that ended up saving her life while the other tried to keep her alert as the color drained from her face. 

'From the moment I got in the ambulance I wanted to know where they were,' Sydney said of parents, her eyes welling with tears. 'I thought I was going to wake up and have no one left but my brother.'

Celeste, who lost both her legs, and Sydney, who suffered severe nerve damage, are now recovering in the same hospital room. 

When they were reunited after the blasts, they said they couldn't stop crying. 

'I couldnt get close enough to her,' Celeste said.

Fears: Sydney Corcoran said she thought she was going to wake up afte surgery and find out that her parents were dead

Family: Sydney Corcoran and her mother Celeste comfort each other in their hospital beds

Comforting her daughter in this time of healing has been difficult because she feels physically limited, she said.

'Normally I'm hugging her and not being able to physically get up and go to her has been really hard,' she said. 

Sydney explained how the doctors prepared her for seeing her mother's injuries just before their reunion.

'Right before they brought her in they made sure they told me [about her injuries] so I wouldn't be in shock more than I already was,' she said. 'So I was a little prepared and honestly, the shock wasn't bad at all because I knew I at least had my mother.'

Sydney, who celebrated her 18th birthday in the hospital this week, also talked about reunited with the man who kept her alert as another stranger dressed her wounds.

'I wanted to find him and meet him and thank him,' she said. 'He was just holding my gaze the entire time, getting right up in my face, he kept calling me "buddy" and kept saying I would be okay and to stay with him and keep my eyes open. It was really difficult, just feeling so tired because all of the blood. My lips turned blue.'

The man who saved her visited her in the hospital and she said it was a very emotional moment. 'The moment I saw him walk through that door and just, I just looked at him and I knew it was him, I just started crying, and he got teary-eyed and came over and hugged me and he was grabbing my hand.'

Since the moments she prayed for death to relieve her pain, Celeste said she has adopted a much more positive outlook on her injuries. 

'There's times when everything just kind of overwhelms you but... I know in my heart that I'm going to be okay,' Celeste said. 'As long as I'm strong enough or want it enough, I will have a different life, a different reality... you really have to dig down deep inside and just be like, "I can do this." It’s going to be hard, but I can do this.'

Sydney said she's also feeling positive. 

'They think that with effort, I might be back to where I was before,' she said.

She hopes to return to high school, and then go to college and pursue her dream of a career in criminal justice. Her mother, on the other hand, hopes to return to the career she loves as a hair dresser. She is determined to get back on her feet in the salon using the help of prosthetic legs. 

An online fundraiser organized by a family friend has raised more than $655,000 in pledges for the women.
