An independent Scotland could be an economic disaster, triggering financial instability and significant spending cuts, Vince Cable warned yesterday.

In a stark assessment, the Lib Dem Business Secretary suggested Scots would have to pay VAT on food and face higher stamp prices, while they would also be hit by currency chaos and isolation from Europe.

And he predicted Royal Bank of Scotland, which has been based north of the border since 1727, would move to London.

Way out? Royal Bank of Scotland could be force to abandon its Edinburgh HQ to move to London in the event of independence, Vince Cable claimed

It
 is just the latest high-level intervention amid growing fears of the 
impact of a ‘yes’ vote in the referendum on Scottish independence on 
September 18.

Bob Dudley, 
chief executive of BP, this week became the first business leader to say
 Britain is better off in its current form, saying: ‘My personal view is
 Great Britain is great and it ought to stay together.’

Business Secretary Vince Cable also raised doubts about Scotland joining the EU, and warned it could mean VAT being added to food and children's clothes

And last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that Scotland could never be fully independent if it keeps the pound.

During
 an hour-long grilling by MPs on the Business Select Committee, Mr Cable
 revealed his concerns about the consequences of an independent Scotland
 on the everyday lives of Scots and the day-to-running of local 
businesses, suggesting:

On
 RBS’s likelihood of staying in Scotland, he said: ‘If you were managing
 RBS, you could almost certainly want to be in a domicile where your 
bank is protected against the risk of collapse.

‘I
 think they already have a substantial amount of their management in 
London. I would have thought that inevitably they would become a London 
bank.’

He also raised his 
doubts about the ‘depleting resources’ from the North Sea oil reserves, 
and the impact that this would have on Scotland’s finances.

There are fears billions of pounds in trade between Scotland's financial services sector and the rest of the UK will be threatened by independence

Mr Cable said: ‘It is very difficult to see how this couldn’t avoid quite severe cuts in public spending.’

He
 also drew attention to the ‘very high level of worry about what an 
independent Scotland would look like’ among Scottish business leaders.

After the hearing, a spokesman for Scotland’s Finance Secretary John Swinney dismissed Mr Cable’s comments as ‘ridiculous’.

He
 said: ‘The pound is as much Scotland’s as it is the rest of the UK’s, 
and the fiscal commission working group, with experts including two 
Nobel laureates, have concluded that it’s in the interests of both 
Scotland and the UK to continue to retain sterling in a formal monetary 
union.’

The Chancellor George Osborne has already cast doubt on whether a currency sharing arrangement would be possible.

Last
 night, an RBS spokesman said it is ‘monitoring the independence debate’
 and said it remains ‘politically completely neutral’.

the ‘zero rate’ of VAT in the UK on essentials such as children’s clothes and most food might disappear.

Scotland’s financial services may be banned from selling Isas, the 
hugely popular tax-free savings accounts, because they are ‘a UK 
product’.

@highlight

Stamp prices 
might rise due to the huge cost of delivering letters in Scotland, which
 has some of the most remote areas in the UK.

@highlight

Post offices, which are heavily subsidised, would also be under threat 
because ‘quite a high percentage of the remote post offices that are not
 commercially viable’ are in Scotland.

@highlight

A currency union in which Scotland is independent but keeps the pound would be ‘extremely difficult’.

Scotland would have to reapply for membership of the European Union which ‘is by no means a given’.
