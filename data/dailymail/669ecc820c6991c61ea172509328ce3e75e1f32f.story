Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho remains furious with French network Canal+ for  broadcasting a private conversation involving him and has withdrawn all his usual post-match co-operation with the TV station.

Canal+ filmed Mourinho talking with the boss of Swiss watchmakers Hublot while on a tour of their Nyon factory. Believing there were no tapes or cameras in the room, he made controversial remarks about Chelsea’s strikers and questioned the age of Samuel Eto’o.

Mourinho normally does a lot more than is required interview-wise with Canal+, who have TV rights for the Premier League and Champions League, but that will cease, at least for this season.

Chelsea have already informed the authorities they will make a player available to Canal+ to comply with media regulations but the  network will not be hearing from Mourinho for the foreseeable future, such is his annoyance.

George Groves is gaining new advisers ahead of his bumper world super middleweight rematch against Carl Froch at Wembley on May 31. Groves has joined Wasserman Media Group, best known for their football clients, though they also have Olympic boxing bronze medallist Anthony Ogogo in their stable.

England outcast Kevin Pietersen is to be the subject of a television documentary in which he will be given plenty of opportunity to have his say about his international cricket exile.

Independent TV production company Fulwell 73, whose acclaimed work includes The Class of 92 about Manchester United’s six star footballers from that year and the award-winning Laurie Cunningham Story, are planning two one-hour programmes about the life of KP.

The project, which will include filming Pietersen in the Indian Premier League, is being offered to TV stations, starting with ITV who are still considering whether to buy. The KP films are likely to be aired in October when the cricketer’s confidentiality agreement with the ECB finishes.

Japanese fashion brand Uniqlo are being linked with a big sponsorship at Manchester United, which could help explain the long delay around Nike’s renewal of their kit supply contract.

The Old Trafford strategy is to carve up sponsorship sectors, with plans for a separate leisurewear deal. Uniqlo, who sponsor golfer Adam Scott and tennis’s Novak Djokovic, are expanding around the world and would be a neat fit for United. 

Nike have ‘matching rights’ with any kit supply contender but United are exploring other options and American brand Warrior are prepared to spend big, as they showed with their £300million Liverpool deal.

Gartside in legal threat

Bolton chairman Phil Gartside is understood to be one of the leading figures behind the eight Championship clubs threatening legal action against the Football League unless changes are made to the ‘anti-competitive’ Financial Fair Play regulations in that division.

Neither Gartside nor the others involved were named in a letter from law firm Brabners to the League. Gartside is keen to keep a low profile after the flak he received in 2008 when he proposed involving Rangers and Celtic in a two-tier Premier League.

Match of the Day, already criticised by BBC director of television Danny Cohen for being ‘too white’, now has BBC1 controller Charlotte Moore calling for a woman to be given a regular part in the show.

Meanwhile Sunderland, who say there is no club strategy favouring female executives, lead the way in employing women in major roles with equal gender representation on the 20-strong management team at the Stadium of Light.

The FA have banned Gary Calder, a former Weymouth CEO, from all football for eight years for multiple betting offences while at the club, including providing information not publicly available which was used for, or in relation to, gambling on a Conference match in 2009. Calder has been out of the sport but the FA acted after learning he hoped to return to football.
