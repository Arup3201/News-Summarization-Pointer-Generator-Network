Parenting website BabyCenter has released its list of Top 100 Baby Names of 2014, and just like last year, it's Sophia for a girl and Jackson for a boy.

But a number of more obscure baby names such as Garrett and Galina are fast-climbing the ranks - character names from House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black respectively - and BabyCenter has put this trend down to the 'Netflix effect.'

'This is the year of the binge-watching baby name,' said the site's global editor in chief, Linda Murray. 'When you spend 16 hours in one weekend binge-watching your favorite series, you can’t help but fall in love with the characters’ names.'

Binge-watching baby names: While the top three names for boys and girls have remained the same as last year, the biggest trend for rising monikers in 2014 appears to be related to popular TV shows

Based on the names of more than 400,000 babies born in 2014 to moms registered to the site, the top three names haven't moved since last year.

Sophia, Emma, then Olivia top the girls list for the third year in a row, while Jackson, Aiden and Liam hold their own at the top of the boys list for the second year running.

The correlation between baby names which are shooting up in popularity, however, and current trending 'binge-watch shows' is undeniable, according to Ms Murray.

Nearly 20 percent of moms surveyed on their naming tactics found inspiration from TV show characters, and 16 percent looked to actors and actresses for great baby name ideas.

Neflix's Emmy Award-winning hit House of Cards seems to have influenced a spike in popularity for baby names shared by its lead characters.

On the 2014 boys list, Frank is up 19per cent from 2013, Garrett is up 16per cent and Remy is up 11per cent; while for girls, Claire is up 14per cent and Zoe is up 13per cent.

And parents aren't just being influenced by character names, they're looking to the actors too. Robin Wright, who plays Claire in House of Cards, may also be responsible for a 12per cent popularity spike for the name 'Robin' and a whopping 65per cent spike for the name 'Wright.'

Orange Is the New Black character names, primarily girls of course, also saw a rise in popularity this year. Galina is up 67per cent, Nicky is up 35per cent, Piper is up 28per cent and Dayanara is up 19per cent from 2013.

ABC's Nashville may have contributed to a surge in names including Luke, up 44per cent, Avery, up 25per cent, Deacon, up 22per cent, Daphne, up 15per cent and Gunnar, up 14per cent.

Jackson, this year's top boys baby name, is a moniker shared by Grey's Anatomy character Dr Jacson Avery, who made his entrance in the show's sixth season.

But other character names from the show including Arizona, Callie, Miranda and Owen have seen an increase in popularity on this year's list.

Disney's Frozen seems to have pushed the name Elsa up by 29per cent since 2013, while the voice behind the animated character, Idina Menzel, may be the reason for 'Idina' making its way onto the 2014 list for the first time, having not appeared on the 2013 list.

Looking to TV for baby naming inspiration, or formally to the Silver Screen, is nothing new.

The name 'Marilyn', for example, saw a rise in popularity at the height of actress Marilyn Monroe's fame in the 50s and 60s, and hasn't picked up steam again since after her death, according to BabyNamesHub.

But for parents who aren't binge-watching TV this year, perhaps they're traveling instead.

'Destination names' accounted for the other major 2014 trend, according to BabyCenter. One in four parents who were 'undecided' on a baby name said they would consider the name of a place they associate with 'special memories.'

Everest was up 70per cent for boys and 21 per cent for girls, Verona was up 58 percent, and Bronx rose 34 percent.
