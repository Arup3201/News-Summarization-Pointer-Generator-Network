Families flying abroad could save up to £71 per child after the Chancellor scrapped the controversial air tax for the under-12s from next May.

And from March 2016, all children under the age of 16 travelling in economy will be exempt from the Air Passenger Duty.

Airlines will also be required to display on tickets exactly how much of the fare was spent on fuel surcharges – so passengers can see at a glance where their money is going.

Lift-off for your holiday: The air tax has been scrapped for children under the age of 12 from next May

Strong words: George Osborne said in 2016 air tax would be scrapped for all children under the age of 16

In this year’s Budget Mr Osborne had already announced that the two highest bands in the four-band system of Air Passenger Duty would be scrapped from April 1, 2015.

The new changes mean that from May 1, a family of five flying to Florida could save £213, or £71 for each child under 12.

Those who fly premium economy, business or first class will not benefit, and it remains unclear if families who have already booked flights on or after the May 1 start date will receive refunds.

However, the Treasury has issued advice to airlines that there will be ‘an expectation’ that parents with children under 12 who have already booked tickets for May 1, 2015, or later ‘will be due a refund’.

Air Passenger Duty, an airport departure tax, has been dubbed the ‘poll tax of the skies’. Mr Osborne has previously admitted that the charge, which was introduced as an environmental measure, is now a pure revenue raiser.

He told the Commons yesterday that he is also putting pressure on airlines to curb the fuel surcharges imposed on passengers when fuel costs go up – and which are often slow to be removed as prices fall.

The Shah family (right) will be able to venture much further afield when the changes take effect.

Raj and Fiona, from Sheffield, travel with sons Oliver, three, and Alexander, 19 months.

Mr Shah, 39, said: ‘It is a hugely positive change. It’s going to open our children up to many more experiences that they would not have the opportunity to have otherwise.

‘Flights for the children will be a lot cheaper.’

Mr Shah, the director of Blue Wealth Capital, a financial planning firm, added: ‘We go abroad twice per year and this year we took the kids to Spain and Greece. We haven’t booked anything for next year yet, but we’re considering long haul now.

‘We have relatives in Kenya and Toronto and it would be lovely to visit them more, or our friends in the Middle East.

'We also have family in Australia, but it’s probably a bit too far for the little ones at the moment. But we would definitely consider visiting them as they get older.’ 

The Chancellor said: ‘We’re going to require airlines to list the charges separately from taxes on tickets. But I also want to reduce the cost of those tickets for families directly. From May 1 next year, Air Passenger Duty for children under 12 will be abolished.

‘And I’ll go further. From the following year, we’ll get rid of APD for children under 16 altogether.’

The Treasury said the changes will ‘save an average family of four £26 on a flight to Europe and £142 on one to the US’.

It follows a recommendation that decisions on APD in Scotland should be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The SNP has said it wants to scrap the tax, which has been in force since 1994. Airports in Newcastle and Manchester fear this would lead to an exodus of English passengers seeking cheaper flights from Scottish airports.

Airlines and airports welcomed the news, but insisted the entire tax should be scrapped. Airlines are required to pay the unpopular APD to the Treasury once a passenger’s flight has departed.

Willie Walsh, the head of British Airways’ parent company, the International Airlines Group, said: ‘Scrapping APD for children might be popular with some voters... but it will do nothing to improve the UK economy.

‘APD must be axed in its entirety. The UK still has the highest flying tax in the world and it should be abolished to allow the aviation and tourism industries to flourish.’

EasyJet said it would refund APD to any customers who had booked tickets for children on or after the May 1 deadline. Chief executive Carolyn McCall said: ‘This is really good news for families.’

BMI regional also said that it would honour the refunds.

Virgin Atlantic boss Craig Kreeger said: ‘This is great news for families and is another step on the long road to reform of this economically damaging tax’.

British Air Transport Association chief executive Nathan Stower called it ‘an early stocking filler for families’, but warned the May 1 deadline presented ‘significant practical difficulties’.

He said: ‘The industry has always said that changes to APD should have at least a 12-month lead-in time due to advance bookings.’

Travel organisation Abta said the news was ‘a hugely positive step’, while Flybe said the move merely ‘tinkered with the edges’ of airport policy and should be taken further. 

Autumn statement: George Osborne and chief Treasury secretary Danny Alexander yesterday

State loans of up to £10,000 will be offered to postgraduate students for the first time.

George Osborne said the funding would ‘revolutionise’ access to postgraduate courses, as high costs deter bright students from poor backgrounds.

The loans will only be available to those under the age of 30 – dealing a blow to mature students – but will cover master’s degrees in any subject.

They will be available from 2016-17, benefiting 40,000 students. The proposals expect to bring an extra 10,000 into postgraduate study.

They will be repaid ‘concurrently’ with undergraduate loans – on which repayments only start once earnings reach a certain level – but may be charged at a higher rate.

Children's television has been given a leg-up, in what has been dubbed the ‘Teletubby’ tax break.

The Chancellor said he wanted to ensure a new generation of children’s programmes is made in Britain by offering incentives to production companies.

Tax relief for children’s animated productions in the UK was introduced in April last year, and it will be extended to live-action shows this coming April.

Mr Osborne said: ‘We will help one area of television production that has been in decline.’

Pact, a body representing UK production companies, estimates the Treasury could also benefit by up to £3million a year from the move.
