A teenager received 23 stitches after being bitten in an apparent shark attack in Delaware.

Andrew Vance, 16, from Laurel, Delaware, was attacked while he swam in five feet of water in Cape Henlopen State Park on Monday.

Posting grisly pictures of the wound on his Facebook page, the teenager said: 'I am the boy that got bit, I'm fine just got out of the hospital. 23 stitches guys and boy did it hurt.'

Biologists think Vance was bitten by a four foot long sandbar shark, which are common to Delaware waters

Vance told park authorities that he felt something grab his left forearm while standing in the water, splashing and skimming his arms over the surface.

The teen said he batted at the mystery attacker with his right arm, at which point it let go and swam away.

He suffered gashes on his left forearm which were first treated by lifeguards at the scene, before he was taken to the Beebe Medical Center for further treatment.

According to biologists, the cuts to his left arm were most likely caused by a juvenile sandbar shark, roughly three or four foot long. Any bigger and the injuries would have been more severe.

Vance's right arm also suffered abrasions, which could be caused by hitting the shark's rough skin.

Beaches at Cape Henlopen State Park were closed while officials hunted for the shark, but were reopened at 1pm after no further sightings were reported

The beaches at Cape Henlopen were closed while park officials watched the waters for any more signs of the shark, but reopened at 1pm after no further sightings were reported.

Sharks are common in Delaware's waters at this time of year as numbers swell following the breeding season, but attacks are rare as they depend on fish for most of their food.

Since 1940, there have been just three other shark attacks in Delaware waters, according to the database at the University of Florida.
