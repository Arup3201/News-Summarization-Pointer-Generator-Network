Michael Norley Jr., 29, is being held on $500,00 bail on a charge of attempted homicide

A Pennsylvania man has been charged with attempted homicide after he dressed up as a ninja and attacked his uncle with a hammer, police said.

Michael Norley Jr., 29, was arrested Tuesday after eluding Upper Providence police for a day.

The man's uncle, 57, was taking the trash out early in the morning when he noticed a man dressed in all black with a mask and helmet.

The man began to swing a ball-peen hammer at the victim, who started to run but was struck several times.

In the struggle that ensued, the victim kicked the  attacker's helmet, revealing his nephew.

He began to scream Norley's name, and the attacker ran away.

The victim was taken to Crozer-Chester Medical center, where he was admitted with severe head trauma.

Police arrested Norley about 6pm on tuesday and charged him with attempted homicide, aggravated assault and reckless endangerment, NBC Philadelphia reported.

'Norley was questioned and admitted to his involvement in the brutal 
attack,' Police Chief David Montella told the Delaware County Daily Times.

'Norley also provided information regarding the 
location of the weapon, as well as his ninja attire,' he added.

His outfit was found some 100 yards from the scene of the attack.

Norley is being held in lieu of $500,000 bail at Delaware County jail.
