This is the moment the man who accused Michael Jackson of sexual abuse marries his childhood sweetheart, with the prosecutor who accused the King of Pop among the guests.

Gavin Arvizo, whose claims led to the sensational trial in 2005, wed Shelby Drake, and celebrated to a Michael Jackson song at their reception after the ceremony in a church in Atlanta.

There was an awkward moment when the DJ played Jackson’s hit ‘The Way You Make Me Feel’ - causing Arvizo to shrug his shoulders in resignation.

Holy matrimony: Gavin Arvizo, who accused Michael Jackson of sexually absuing him in 2005, has married Shelby Drake

The guest list included some unusual additions, like the former Santa Barbara Senior Assistant District Attorney Ron Zonen, who prosecuted the Jackson case.

Details of 
Arvizo’s life were made public in an article in the Daily Beast 
which revealed he is now living a modest life working as a paralegal and
 wants to go to Harvard.

Arvizo,
 now 24, was a 13-year-old cancer survivor when he claimed Jackson had 
abused him at his Neverland Ranch in Los Olivos, California.

The allegations led to the trial that derailed Jackson’s career, even though he was acquitted on all 10 counts.

Arvizo’s
 wedding took place at the bride’s suburban Atlanta Baptist Church on 
Saturday November 30 but have only now come to light.

Departure: The newlyweds exists the church, located in suburban Atlanta where the bride's father is a minister

Her father Bill Drake, an ordained 
minister, and a Catholic priest, Kevin Hargaden, performed the service 
and Arvizo plans to worship in both churches.

Drake spent time in England when his daughter was young, meaning she spent part of her childhood in the UK.

Among the guests was US comedienne Louise Palanker, a mentor to the Arvizo family who was called as a prosecution witness in the trial, and Arvizo’s mother Janet, who ironically, has married a man called Jay Jackson - meaning her name now is Janet Jackson.

Also present was Gavin’s older sister Davellin and her brother Star, who both testified against Jackson.

According to the article Arvizo only talks about his past when he applies for jobs and over the years has turned down lucrative offers to speak out.

The article says: ‘He says he knows the truth and believes it will be revealed to the doubters of the world when the time is right.’ 

Jackson died in 2009, aged 50, whilst preparing for the This Is It comeback concerts at the O2 arena in London.
