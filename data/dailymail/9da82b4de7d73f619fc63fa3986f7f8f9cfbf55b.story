The great Malky Mackay gamble might be on its last legs, but the final breath of air hasn't been sucked out just yet.

Owner Dave Whelan is back from his annual Caribbean winter cruise on Friday, furious with a scandalously poor run of results to have plunged the Latics deep into the relegation mire.

The pensioner does not want this potential relegation to be his legacy and is considering sacking Mackay for the good of their future.

That consideration will need to be tempered in the coming days, however, after debutant Jason Pearce's 17th-minute poke against a hapless Reading was enough to secure the manager's second win of a dismal three-month spell.

They still look devoid of ideas going forward, a little shaky in possession, but the way in which the 2013 FA Cup winners battled here suggests they have the stomach to escape from this.

'It's a brand new group over the last three weeks,' Mackay said. 'It closes the gap. There are a lot of points to play for. It's about personality and character and we're beginning to show that.

'We lost Liam Ridgewell back to Portland Timbers and this is a brand new central defensive partnership with Harry Maguire and Pearce standing firm.'

Wigan are a club still in a post-Roberto Martinez state of confusion, aware of their alarming slide but using just blindfolds, tails and donkeys in trying to fix it. The appointments of Owen Coyle and Uwe Rosler proved flawed; so too does the reasoning behind luring Mackay - then still under investigation by the FA for abusive text messages sent as manager of Cardiff City.

It's so far been an unmitigated disaster - Whelan has even been banned from 'footballing activities' himself for defending the Scot - but everyone around the DW Stadium will be buoyed by grit and steel on display at the Madejski. However turgid the affair is irrelevant at this stage.

The winner came with more than its fair share of good fortune, goalkeeper Adam Federici inexplicably fumbling Leon Clarke's tame header inside the six-yard box for Pearce to prod home. It was only their second goal in five games and that the ball went beyond the embarrassed Australian was the only thing to matter.

From there Wigan relaxed somewhat and, but for a trio of missed chances by Reading's loanee Nathaniel Chalobah, looked the more threatening - particularly when James McClean was given time to stretch his legs on the counter.

Clarke was unsurprisingly apoplectic.

'Rubbish. I've no idea why,' he said. 'I've got to look long and hard at it. I need a different way of playing at home.

'It's very frustrating. To be honest tonight was a little bit embarrassing; it was so poor. If you see us here it's a team who's going to be fighting relegation.

'I don't think they spent any money on the pitch in the summer because of the money situation.'

Mackay had barked relentlessly, fidgeting on the touchline like a man whose career is reliant on this sorry mess correcting itself. The deep exhales told the whole story - a few more nights like these wouldn't go amiss, although he could've done without the needless 11 minutes of additional time.

It is results like these which will give Mackay hope of avoiding the drop
