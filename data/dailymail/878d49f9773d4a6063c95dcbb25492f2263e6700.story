This incredible photograph has sparked debate and confusion across the internet.

The image, which has sweeped across social media sites, appears to show a python that has just finished a human-sized meal.

While suggestions about where the picture may have been taken range between Asia, Africa and America, the general consensus is that this snake's food was human.

This incredible photograph, which appears to show a snake shortly after a human-sized meal, has sparked debate and confusion across the internet

One website claims it was taken in India, where the mighty snake swallowed a sleeping drunkard.

Another version goes that the snake swallowed a woman in Durban North, South Africa, this summer, and that the picture was taken by a reporter.

The picture has also been claimed to have been taken in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Guyana, South America.

There have also been stories that the snake was found in game reserve before eating its rescuer.

Many others, including the website Hoax Slayer, have claimed the photograph is fake.

If real, this would not be the first reported incident involving a python eating a human whole

One of the deadliest creatures in the world, this would not represent the first time a python has eaten a human.

In 2002, a 20ft python reportedly swallowed a ten-year-old boy whole in Durban, South Africa, in the first recorded man-eating incident for its species.

Meanwhile, last month a ten-foot albino Burmese python swallowed two cats in Florida, United States.

Elsewhere, in 2011 a 16-foot python was found in the Everglades National Park, United States, after swallowing a whole adult deer.

Python snakes are found in countries across Africa, Asia and Australia. They are also now found in North America after making their way into the Everglades National Park, Florida.

There are currently 26 species of python recognised across the world.

Reported attacks on humans are rare, and the snake is generaly expected to remain calm unless startled or provoked.

Their victims are killed by constriction and then swallowed whole. Depending on the size of the prey, the digestion process can take weeks.
