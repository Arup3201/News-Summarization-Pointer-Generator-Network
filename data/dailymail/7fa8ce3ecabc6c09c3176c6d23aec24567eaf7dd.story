Body-mounted cameras could help police on the beat to convict more criminals, Theresa May said yesterday.

The widespread use of small recording devices pinned to officers’ lapels would encourage more guilty pleas once offenders are confronted with footage of their actions, the Home Secretary said.

They also ensure that time-consuming ‘vexatious’ complaints by known yobs against officers are promptly dismissed, she added.

Thousands of police are already routinely using the devices, but Mrs May endorsed their roll-out across every force in England and Wales.

Her comments were welcomed by rank-and-file police groups, who said cameras helped convict drunken yobs who denied violent or abusive behaviour when hauled to court.

However, privacy groups said the cameras could undermine trust between the police and the public and branded them an ‘underhand surveillance tactic’.

Emma Carr, deputy director of  privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘The use of body-worn cameras has the potential to seriously undermine trust between the police and members of the community.

‘It is far from clear why the police need this kind of equipment, and  the police should concentrate their efforts on engaging with the local community to tackle the issues of anti-social behaviour rather than resorting to underhand surveillance tactics.’

Lightweight lapel cameras can record several hours of footage and sound and be switched on and off by officers when needed.

The lightweight cameras are already used by five police forces in the UK

Home Secretary Theresa May said cameras can increase the number of guilty pleas

Five English forces – Hampshire, 
Northamptonshire, Sussex, Thames Valley and Avon and Somerset – are 
already using them. They are also used in Scotland.

Mrs May told the Police Federation annual conference in Bournemouth: ‘Evidence from Scotland suggests that evidence from body-worn cameras can increase the number of early guilty pleas to the extent that 90 per cent of suspects confronted by that evidence plead guilty early.

‘They can also help by eliminating vexatious complaints from known troublemakers – something I know causes a lot of unnecessary stress and wastes too much time.’

Steve White, deputy chairman of the Police Federation, said cameras were useful when dealing with drunken yobs who then arrived at court ‘suited and booted’ and disputed officers’ accounts.

‘The cameras provide best evidence for police officers and make clear to the court what actually happened,’ he said.

In her speech, Mrs May also condemned police officers who bring ‘frivolous’ legal claims against the public and warned that the fear of being sued could make citizens reluctant to dial 999.

It is ‘simply not the sort of attitude police officers should exhibit’ she said – a reference to the case of Norfolk PC Kelly Jones who planned to sue a garage owner after tripping on a kerb while responding to a 999 call.

Mrs May also confirmed plans to prevent officers resigning to avoid disciplinary measures and agreed to publish the names of those who have been dismissed for misconduct.

Claims that police were downgrading offences were dismissed – with the national crime survey used as evidence that crime is now at an all-time low.

And proposals to give whole-life jail terms to cop killers were met with applause. ‘To attack and kill a police officer is to attack the fundamental basis of our society,’ she said.
