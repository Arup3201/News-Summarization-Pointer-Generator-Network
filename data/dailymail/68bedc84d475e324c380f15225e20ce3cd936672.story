Yummy mummies keen to get their children into the arts can get a head start thanks to a new collaboration between Bugaboo and Andy Warhol.

Babies can sleep under a canopy, or be shaded from the sun with a parasol, featuring designs by the late legendary pop artist.

Two designs will go on sale in May - 'Flowers' featuring Warhol's famous floral work in bold red and black, and the more boyish 'Cars' print in black and cream, that the artist created in 1962.

But as you'd expect from the stroller brand beloved by stars such as Adele, Myleene Klass and Sienna Miller, the Warhol-themed accessories don't come cheap.

A Flowers or Cars fabric set for the Bugaboo Cameleon3 and the Bugaboo Donkey costs £149.95, while a sun canopy for the Bugaboo BEE is £99.95. The Flowers parasol retails at £59.95.

This is on top of the cost of the stroller itself - the Chameleon3 will set you back £799, the BEE £479 and the Donkey from £899 to £1,219.

Warhol remains one of the world's leading figures in contemporary art more than 25 years after his death.

Bugaboo collaborated with the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts to make the Warhol-inspired pushchair accessories possible.

Further designs will be released over the year.

Madeleen Klaasen, chief marketing officer Bugaboo International said: 'With every new collection we look to further unfold the authenticity, style and originality of Andy Warhol’s extraordinary legacy.'

Michael Hermann, head of licensing at the Andy Warhol Foundation, added: 'We love working with brands that understand the relevance of Warhol’s influence on contemporary art and culture, and who create products that reflect his sophisticated sense of design. Needless to say, Bugaboo perfectly fits that description.'

Bugaboo have previously collaborated with Viktor & Rolf, Missoni and Marc Jacobs.

Founded in 1999 by designer Max Barenbrug and physician Eduard Zanen, Amsterdam-based Bugaboo has become a firm favourite with affluent parents. The Bugaboo Donkey flew off the shelves when it was released in 2011 and the brand has many loyal celeb fans.
