When it comes to wrinkle-busting skincare and a 
holistic approach to looking and feeling younger, Dr Nicholas Perricone 
is the go-to guy for a host of Park Avenue princesses and Hollywood's leading 
ladies.

He first hit the headlines in the early nineties with
his books The Wrinkle Cure and The Perricone Prescription, which 
claimed that a diet rich in salmon and berries could help you look 
younger in just three days.

And now, the man himself has teamed up with Ocado to bring his service to your front door.

Coming to a door near you: Ocado have teamed up with Dr Perricone to offer his three-day diet to shoppers

Ocado are introducing a Perricone food basket on their website, which means with just a few clicks all the ingredients can be added to your list and delivered together in your chosen time slot.

This anti-inflammatory 
diet, which is rich in lean proteins, antioxidants and essential fatty 
acids, is said to be followed by celebrities such as Eva Mendes, Cate 
Blanchett, Kim Cattrall and Julia Roberts.

Dr Perricone believes that wrinkles, 
lines, puffiness and sagging are a symptom of ‘inflammation’ at cellular
level, caused by poor diet, overexposure to sun, air pollution, and 
other modern-day skin irritants.

His
plan counteracts premature ageing by directly reducing cell level 
inflammation through a special diet high in omega oils and other 
nutritional wonder-foods, as opposed to Botox and surgery.

Foods in his diet include salmon, tuna, turkey, olive oil, nuts, fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs.

One of the key ingredients in the 
food basket, which starts from £80, is salmon, which contains essential 
fatty acids that help to dramatically reduce puffiness, increase 
radiance and add firmness to the skin.

Dr Perricone is so convinced by the power of salmon, he recommends you eat it twice a day, but you may substitute it for poultry or tofu if necessary.

But does it work?

Lorna Driver-Davies, NutriCentre Nutritional Therapist, said: 'My initial concern with this diet is the amount of salmon Dr Perricone suggests is consumed to achieve results.

'NHS advice says males and women past child-bearing age (or those who will not conceive) may consume up to four portions of oily fish per week. Women of child-bearing age should only consume up to two portions of oily fish per week.

'This is because of the levels of pollutants found in oily fish, especially the heavy metal mercury which is toxic. As a nutritionist I would therefore not recommend someone eat this much salmon for any kind of diet.

'If they wanted to achieve the same effect, they are better off eating two portions per week and then taking a high quality fish oil supplement which is certified as being clean from heavy metals and other contaminants.

'The rest of the diet is actually really good - particularly almonds, berries and plant oils such as olive oil - think how good Mediterranean skin often looks.'

Brains behind the business: Dr Perricone (L) takes a 'no knife' approach to anti-ageing and believes the key lies in healthy foods rich in fatty acids. He also has his own skincare line (R)
