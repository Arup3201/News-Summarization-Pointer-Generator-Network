Diet guru Pierre Dukan, a favourite of Carole Middleton, faces being struck off as a doctor in France for giving ‘dangerous’ food advice to teenagers.

The celebrity nutritionist was yesterday accused of breaching medical ethics for saying slimmer pupils should be awarded higher exam marks than their fatter friends.

Dr Dukan said in January that pupils should be able to opt for an extra exam subject called ‘ideal weight’, which they could pass simply by being thin enough.

'Breached medical ethics': Dr Pierre Dukan is being investigated in France after saying that thinner pupils should get higher exam marks

They would then earn extra marks in their Baccalaureate, the French equivalent of A-levels, which they take at the age of 17.

But the French College of Physicians 
yesterday lodged a complaint against Dr Dukan for ‘remarks which could 
harm teenagers already struggling with obesity or anorexia’.

The popularity of Dr Dukan’s 
high-protein diet soared after Mrs Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge’s
mother, revealed she had been following it.

Other celebrity followers include the 
duchess herself and her sister Pippa Middleton, Jennifer Lopez, 
supermodel Gisele Bundchen and Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins.

But food experts in Britain  and 
abroad have claimed that the regime is a ‘health hazard’ because it 
involves a very low vegetable and carbohydrate intake.

The French College of Physicians said 
Dr Dukan was in breach of article 13 of the medical ethics code, which 
states: ‘A doctor must be aware of the repercussions his views can have 
on the public.’

The Dukan is a complicated four-phase diet which promotes weight loss of around 7lb per week.

It starts with the ‘attack’ stage in which users eat only lean protein and zero-fat dairy products for up to a week. 

In the second stage, dieters can add non-starchy vegetables on alternate days.

Fruit and starchy foods are allowed only in the final two phases.

Dieters are also told to drink two litres of water a day and eat oat bran to provide fibre.

Dr Dukan says the diet is safe to follow and has claimed that 40 per cent of Dukan dieters have not regained weight afterwards.

However, it topped the British Dietetic Association's annual list of the five worst celebrity diets to avoid this year.

The BDA says cutting out food groups is not advisable.

They also said the multi-million-pound profits from his diet food empire were not compatible with the code of medical practice.

Dr Dukan defended his plans to reward 
slimmer pupils with higher marks, after his scheme came  under attack 
from the French media in January.

He said: ‘There is nothing unhealthy about educating youngsters  about nutrition.

‘My idea would change nothing for 
those who have no need to get thinner. But for those who do, it would 
only motivate them to lose weight.’

Dr Dukan’s controversial schools 
project came a year after a study found that almost half of the 
traditionally slender French were now overweight.

Despite still being officially 
Europe’s second thinnest people, the report found the French are piling 
on  the pounds with a diet of fast-food and TV dinners.

It also revealed obesity increased 
most in France in the 1990s, when the weight of the average French 
person increased by 10 per cent between 1992 and 2003.

France’s Obesity Commission president 
Valerie Boyer said after the study that a major national action plan was
needed in order to slim down Gallic waistlines.

It was back in October 2010 that Mrs 
Middleton helped fuel publicity for the diet when she told an 
interviewer: ‘I’ve been doing it for four days and I’ve lost four 
pounds.’

Her daughter Pippa joked that 57-year-old Mrs Middleton was surviving on cottage cheese and prawns on the high-protein diet.

The news prompted speculation that Mrs
Middleton was slimming for a royal wedding, and the following month 
William and Kate’s engagement was officially announced.

Even Dr Dukan himself acknowledged Mrs
Middleton’s contribution to the diet’s success in Britain, which he 
famously put down to two factors – ‘It works, and Carole Middleton.’
