A radio station has been forced to apologise to actress Helen Flanagan after being accused of encouraging listeners to bully and “troll” the former Coronation Street star.

Manchester’s Key 103 ran an online poll on their website, asking if people 'loved or loathed' the 23-year-old.

Similar comments were made during the station’s breakfast show.

But angry listeners hit back and accused the station of promoting bullying, prompting the network to apologise and remove the poll from the internet, admitting it was “inappropriate”.

The blunder comes after claims that a second teenager in a month appears to have taken his own life as a result of online bullying.

Apprentice mechanic Daniel Perry, 17, threw himself from the Forth Road Bridge after being blackmailed by online bullies, while 14-year-old Hannah Smith is believed to have been subjected to taunts online before taking her own life.

A Key 103 spokesman said: 'Yesterday some comments were made on air and on Facebook about Helen Flanagan and for that we sincerely apologise.  We are sorry for any offence this caused.'

The spokesman added: 'The wording of the posting was inappropriate and as soon as it was seen by our senior team at the station it was taken down.

'We are now in discussions with the staff member responsible for the posting.'

Several listeners posted messages of their own condemning the discussion topic.

One commenter, Nicky Phillips, replied: 'Have you nasty lot ever heard the saying "if you can’t say anything nice then don’t saying anything at all’. “You should take this post down as it’s really quite unnecessary and just encourages people to bully.”Another, Marc Allan, added: 'Promoting bullying and trolling! You should be supporting a fellow Mancunian.'

Helen Flanagan has previously spoken of her own issues with depression and anxiety, and in December 2012 revealed she was on medication for ADHD and bipolar disorder.

The actress was also forced to hire security guards earlier this year after her Cheshire home was burgled by three men wielding a saw and a screwdriver as weapons, in a terrifying armed robbery in June.
