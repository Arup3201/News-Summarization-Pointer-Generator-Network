Patrick Bamford has revealed an unlikely source for finding out that Jose Mourinho was keeping a close eye on him: One Direction's Niall Horan.

The on-loan Derby striker never got the chance to speak to Mourinho upon the Portuguese manager's return to Stamford Bridge last summer because he was shipped out at MK Dons at the time.

But 20-year-old Bamford looks set to return to Chelsea this summer to become the club's third-choice striker after finding out about Mourinho's text messages to pop singer Horan whenever he scored for Derby.

Bamford told The Guardian: 'Niall from One Direction is a big Derby fan, he came down to the club and I was talking to him.

'Niall said: "Mourinho knows all about you, he texts me all the time." I said: "No he doesnâ€™t." He showed me his phone, and because he was doing his treatment at Chelsea, for his knee injury, he knew all the Chelsea boys and Mourinho.

'And he had texts from Mourinho whenever I scored, saying "Bamford again!" That made me smile. That was the first time I knew that Mourinho knew about me.'
