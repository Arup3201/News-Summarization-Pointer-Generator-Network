For more than half a century, D-Day and the military invasion known as Operation Overlord have been synonymous with the Allied victory in the Second World War.

But new never-before-seen documents have revealed the codenames for these campaigns were changed almost three weeks before the invasion of Nazi-occupied France.

The top secret documents - discovered among the possessions of a late Army officer involved in the planning of D-Day - were discovered when the officer's son presented his father's belongings to an expert on Antiques Roadshow.

The urgent memo was sent to senior officers on May 19, 1944, 18 days before the June 6 raid, stating: 'Overlord should be swapped for Hornpipe and D-Day should be referred to as Halcyon.'

The documents (pictured) show senior officers were briefed to use three replacement code names of 'Hornpipe', 'Halcyon' and 'Ripcord'

The documents were discovered by Richard Wheeler when he cleaned out his parents' home in 1999 and found his father Sam 'Moses' Wheeler (left) had kept the secret documents. Pictured on the right is an illustration of Major Wheeler taken from a book about men who served in the Second World War

The memo also said the codename 'Ripcord' should be used to signal a 24-delay to the operation.

The last-minute change came following concerns the original codenames had been compromised when many of them, including Overlord, appeared in crosswords in a national newspaper.

The Allied high command had referred to the the planned mass invasion of occupied France by the codename Overlord ever since it was conceived in 1943.

The remarkable development was discovered when Richard Wheeler was clearing out his late father Major Sam Wheeler's house and stumbled upon the documents.

Major Wheeler had helped plan the logistics for D-Day, which was masterminded by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, and had somehow ended up keeping the papers, stamped 'top secret'.

Mr Wheeler took them to show experts at the BBC's Antiques Roadshow at Durham Cathedral - and they were left stunned when he explained what they were.

Mr Wheeler, 67, from Durham, said: 'My father joined the army at the outbreak of war and worked his way up through the ranks, eventually joining the 21st Army Group in 1944.

'They were based at the army's headquarters in London and was responsible for the planning of the D-Day invasions.

'My father was involved in the logistics of the invasion and so would have been close to these messages being passed back and forward.

Labelled 'top secret', the files (pictured) were kept by Major Sam Wheeler, who was involved in planning the logistics of D-Day, or as it was later called, Halcyon

The documents (pictured) also stated the term 'Ripcord' should be used for a 24-hour delay to the invasion

'It was only when I was clearing out my parents' house following the death of my mother in 1999 that I found these documents.

'I showed a few of my friends but no-one thought much of them.

'When I heard the Antiques Roadshow was coming to Durham I thought I would take them along and that's when people started getting excited about them.

'It's amazing to think I have had them for all these years and my father had them before me.'

Paul Atterbury, an expert on Antiques Roadshow, said: 'D-Day is such a well-documented moment in time that I was amazed that something new could come out of it.

'I was very intrigued when these documents were brought onto the Antiques Roadshow. They seem to suggest there was a different set of codewords used briefly in the run-up to D-Day.

'Our interpretation of what happened is that because of security fears a new layer of codewords were introduced.

'There was a risk that the Overlord codename had been compromised. There's a well-known story of how Overlord and many other codenames appeared in a newspaper crosswords which aroused suspicion.

'The documents make it very clear these are replacement codewords for the established ones in use.

'They say Overlord would have to be replaced with Hornpipe and D-Day replaced by Halcyon. There was also a new codeword for 'delay', which was Ripcord.

'The documents were issued on May 19 1944 and we think they went into use very quickly. Because D-Day was a success the replacement codenames were then abandoned and everyone went back to Overlord and D-Day.

'The new codenames would only have been used by the very high echelons of officers. They were afraid the Germans might have picked up the existing codewords and know that something was about to happen.

'New codewords were quickly conceived and circulated on a need-to-know basis. The documents we saw definitely had signals sent that incorporated these words.

'These documents may exist in the national archives but no-one has ever drawn attention to them.

'They are completely genuine and come from a very clear source with links to Montgomery's office.

'None of the many books published about D-Day mention these codewords and as far as we know this story has never been told before. These documents could change history.'

The story will feature on the Antiques Roadshow on December 28.
