Pricey and prickly: Fashionable African pygmy hedgehogs can cost up to £200

Worried animal charities are being swamped by African pygmy hedgehogs that have been abandoned by their owners.

The fashionable pets cost up to £200 and owners often post photographs on social media sites Instagram or Twitter of them peeking out of the top of handbags.

But the RSPCA and hedgehog rescue centres say they are being inundated after owners tire of the breed’s ‘cuteness’.

They blame websites for fuelling a rise in sales, and say people do not know enough about how to care for the animals before they buy them.

Some creatures have been handed in with their spikes missing after being infested with mites.

Charities are now demanding a ban on the sale of live animals online.

Philip Mansbridge, chief executive of the charity Care For The Wild, pointed the finger at social media sites and said: ‘People are being led on by the cuteness factor and the status of having something they can post pictures of.’

Since 2013, the National Exotic Hedgehog Rescue Service has taken in 89 discarded pygmies, which are a cross between the Algerian and white-bellied breeds.

They are bred in captivity and are smaller than those found in the countryside.
