Floyd Mayweather’s potential mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao could take place in the Middle East.

Reports have claimed that a group of investors in the United Arab Emirates have put around £70million up to help facilitate hosting the fight in Dubai.

After years of posturing, it seems that the super-fight could be edging closer with May 2015 being the target date for the two superstars of boxing to finally get in the ring together.

Mayweather’s hometown of Las Vegas is one of the favourites to host the fight, but Pacquiao’s last fight against Chris Algieri was held in the Chinese city of Macau and that could also be another option for the fight.

But Dubai has emerged as a potential third host for the fight. The Middle East has never hosted anything of this size in the past and the time difference between Dubai and America would have to be factored in.

Muhammad Ali and George Foreman famously fought in Zaire 40 years ago and Hasim Rahman beat Lennox Lewis in South Africa in 2001. But rarely do mega-fights such as this happen outside America.

But that has not stopped the Middle East group talking up their chances of hosting the fight.

Spokesman for the group, M Akbar Muhammad told boxingscene.com: ‘The funding is in place, and because of this and the group’s unique and distinctive make-up and backgrounds, it has emerged as the leading and most serious group striving to secure the bout. I’ve been instructed by the group to do whatever it takes to bring this long-awaited and eagerly-anticipated fight to fruition.

‘There’s absolutely no doubt that each fighter, individually, will receive more money than any other boxer has in the past. The combined purses are approaching $200million (£127m). And, rest assured, we have the resources to do just that.

‘We want to be a part of Mr Mayweather’s historic march to 50-0, no matter where the fights may take place.’

Since his win at the end of last month over Algieri, PacMan has been keen to talk up the prospect of a fight with Mayweather.

Pacquiao took to Instagram to say: ‘Stop throwing punches on Instagram and let's get in the ring! #TBE #TheBestExcuses’
