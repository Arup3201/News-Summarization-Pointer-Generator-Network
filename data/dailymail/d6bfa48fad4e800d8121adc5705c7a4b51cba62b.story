Beachgoers are being warned to think again before taking a plunge - after tests revealed high levels of raw sewage are spilling into the sea.

Some of Brtain's most popular beaches, including Weston-Super-Mare, Exmouth and Blackpool, recorded the worst bathing water quality standards for more than a decade, according to a list obtained by The Sunday Times.

All of the 26 beaches in England and Wales failed to meet even the most basic standards this summer.

Always popular with tourists in the summer, high levels of pollution were even seen at Exmouth in Devon

The beach at Seaton Carew has made it onto the list for poor water quality this year

Plymouth Hoe has been affected by sewage spilling into the sea water

The results are the worst seen in ten years, despite water companies investing billions of pounds in stopping raw sewage being pumped out to sea and could spell disaster for beach towns across Britain that rely on tourism.

In 2015, tougher standards are being introduced and will be partly based on this year's results. At the worst beaches, signs will go up warning people not to swim.

At a conference in Blackpool on Monday, Robert Keirle, pollution programme manager for the Marine Conservation Society warned that beaches could be left deserted unless improvements were made.

Mr Keirle estimated that Blackpool alone could face losing about £1billion in lost revenue over 15 years.

Water companies needed to make more efforts, as well as farmers and householders to protect beaches from becoming polluted and there needs to be more information on the times of sewage overflows, added Mr Keirle.

'It is essential that all sewage overflows are mapped and monitored,' he told the conference.

Tourist risk: Blackpool North and Blackpool South were both on the list

On the coast: the village of Staithes in North Yorkshire

The overflows, which operate during heavy rainfall, are one of the biggest causes of pollution flowing into the sea along Britain's coastline. They are supposed to operate only three times in one bathing season, but some resorts can have more than 100 sewage spills during a wet summer.

More than 450 can also affect designated bathing areas, including 50 blue flag beaches.

Steven Mogford, chief executive of United Utilities, based in the north-west, said the company was working to provide more information to the public about sewage overflows.

The beach at Penzance, Cornwall, is picturesque, but the water quality for bathers is poor

Kimmeridge Bay, Dorset is another tourist hotspot, but has also been slated for poor bathing water standards

With its sweeping landscape, Mount's Bay, West Cornwall attracts plenty of visitors, but beware of the sea water

But the situation is critical for more than 40 beaches in England and Wales, which are projected to fail when the new standards are introduced in 2015.

These include Rock in Cornwall, Combe Martin in north Devon and Blackpool.

According to Surfers Against Sewage, the current sewer system is 'woefully inadequate' and said many overflows were not fit for purpose.

But the environment department said 50% or resorts were expected to meet the standards, with 90% achieving at least the minimum.
