Jeffrey Campbell's best-selling platform ankle boot, Lita, has been labelled 'the world’s ugliest shoe' - more so than Crocs, UGG Boots and even Celine's recent mink-lined sandals. But is the title deserved?

Last week, the Los Angeles-based brand released a wedding range of Lita boots, called Cold Feet, prompting The Daily Beast to describe the shoe as 'hideous,' and 'the Clydesdale hoof of modern footwear.'

But the opinion of fashion industry experts is divided; and with the Lita being sold everywhere from Nordstrom to Urban Outfitters, the shoe's popularity may just speak for itself.

The Lita Boot: Jeffrey Campbell's best-selling platform ankle boot, Lita, has been labelled 'the world¿s ugliest shoe' - more so than Crocs, UGGs and even Celine's recent furry mink sandals. But is the title deserved?

The Lita boot, with a  two-inch platform and five-inch heel,
retails for between $160 and $190.

First introduced in 2010, the shoe style was initially offered in mustard yellow, but has since been produced in 164 different colors and 65 different versions so far - selling nearly 160,000 pairs.

The Daily Beast's Misty White Sidell described Jeffery Campbell as 'best known for producing cheaper imitations of runway shoes,' adding that they are 'probably Instagram’s favorite 
shoe (tagged over 47,000 times on the app), but that doesn’t mean 
they’re attractive in real life.'

Named after Lita Ford of the Seventies band, The Runaways, the shoe's popularity is undeniable.

'Jeffrey 
Campbell Lita's in your closet? You're golden'

Miss White Sidell explains that he majority of Lita wearers wore the shoe in black, 'which 
they’d often pair with American Apparel chiffon maxi skirts and some 
sort of sweater.'

But then
come the 
shoe's eclectic prints: from cosmic stars, to the American flag and even
cat tapestry, the shoe was soon seen on every New York style blogger.

'Within a year, the elephant shoes had trickled 
down through fashion social hierarchy, proliferating from the feet of 
Teen Vogue interns to those of downtown dive bar dwellers,' wrote Miss White Sidell.

'In the 
lead-up to that summer’s Independence Day festivities, New York’s 
peacocking neighborhoods were awash with the American flag print 
version.'

While there are many fashion insiders that agree (in a Lita-dedicated post titled 'Shoe Vom,' Ceriselle, a fashion and lifestyle blog based in Bristol by Hayley Constantine, called them 'offensive'), there are many more who disagree.

Rachel Schwartzmann, a New York City-based fashion blogger who contributes to The Huffington Post, recently wrote: 'Have
a pair of eye-catching shoes, you're set. Have a pair of Jeffrey 
Campbell's Lita's in your closet, you're golden.'

She went on to discuss the brand's 'fabulous and groundbreaking 
designs in footwear,' saying: 'Even a little rain and wind won't 
stop me from living and loving in my Litas.'

Nylon magazine's Ali Hoffman also wrote last year: 
'Jeffrey Campbell is to shoes as Ben & Jerry's is to ice cream: What 
first sounds like a crazy-slash-overwhelming mess of ingredients somehow
works perfectly in real life.'

And Lucky magazine's Lauren Sherman noted in 
2011: 'Another ubiquitous New York Fashion Week street style trend? 
Jeffrey Campbell's Lita boot.

'This bold shoe boasts a hidden 
platform - which makes it comfy without forsaking an edge - and comes in 
around 40 different colors and materials, from army green to red 
glitter.'

Regardless of the Lita's rank in shoe 'ugliness,' fans can now take their platform boots to the alter with Jeffery Campbell's wedding collection - which was 'made for the non-traditional bride in mind,' according to the company's website.

There are many reasons we turn to ugly shoes - ignoring function for the sake of fetish, fashion fantasy.

And there are just as many aesthetically-challenged shoes that the public has collectively embraced, for both fashion and comfort.

Crocs are lightweight, 
waterproof and bacteria resistant, molded
from a material called croslite. Great for hospitals, commercial kitchens and kindergarten schools, Crocs are practical - but otherwise, unnecessary.
