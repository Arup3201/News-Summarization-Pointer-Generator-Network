Piers Morgan says that England captain Wayne Rooney 'likes a drink', and claims he once saw the Manchester United striker fall over into a plant pot when he was drunk.

Morgan alleges the incident happened in the summer of 2012 when Rooney and his wife Coleen were visiting him in Los Angeles.

The star striker, already the worse for wear before midnight, then got up and went to a nightclub until five in the morning, claims Morgan.

'And he's lying, trapped in this pot, and Coleen just looked down at him and went "for God's sake Wayne, let's get you home". 

'So I assumed he was going home, then I woke up in the morning and checked my Twitter feed and there was one from Coleen, from 5am, from Bababoom nightclub in West Hollywood saying "having a great time with Wayne". So they party those two.'
