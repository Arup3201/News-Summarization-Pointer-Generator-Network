Former Liverpool striker Sebastian Leto has been taken to hospital for emergency treatment after a barbell fell on his head during training.

Now at Italian side Catania, Leto suffered the injury after a squat exercise in the gym which saw a barbell drop on his head.

The 28-year-old, who has been on loan at Argentinian club Lanus since February 3, was initially sent home by the medical staff with a deep wound in his head.

But he later went to the hospital after suffering headaches and is now in intensive care.

Doctors are not ruling out surgery for the 28-year-old and it is feared Leto may have internal hemorrhaging.

Leto was signed by Rafa Benitez from Lanus in 2007 and made 15 appearances for the Reds before leaving for Olympiacos on loan in 2008.

He left Anfield permanently a year later when he signed for Greek side Panathinaikos before moving on to Catania in the summer of 2013.
