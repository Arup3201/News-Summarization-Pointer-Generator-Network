It was an evening of fashion fails, shocks and awes at the star-studded 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards on Sunday night.

Miley Cyrus, 20, managed to turn heads for all the wrong reasons (again) in an ensemble resembling a bargain-bin find in an 80s thrift store, while Iggy Azalea tried to out flash the Wrecking Ball star. Meanwhile Rita Ora and Ellie Goulding wowed the crowds at the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam with their figure-revealing outfits.

Here FEMAIL brings you our pick of the best - and worst - dressed...

We wish she'd adhere to the message on her rear when it comes to flashing the flesh: Miley Cyrus' dress was adorned with pictures of Tupac and Biggie Smalls, with the words VIOLENCE scrawled across the crotch area and PLEASE STOP on the back

Miley's plunging 
lace-up mini dress was adorned with pictures of Tupac and Biggie Smalls,
with the words VIOLENCE scrawled across the crotch area and PLEASE STOP
across the rear. The racy Please Stop The Violence number
from NY Vintage archives barely covered Miley's bottom and drawstrings 
just about kept the tiny piece of fabric attached to her slim frame.

She completed her look with a selection of gold and silver jewels and monochrome chequered thigh-high boots from Tom Ford Fall 2013.

While the current bad girl of pop showed she definitely doesn't feel the cold, she wasn't the only car-crash on the red carpet.

Miley's crotch-skimming number was rivalled by Iggy Azalea's sheer black dress that was slashed all the way up to her bellybutton - as both stars proved it must be busy season for bikini waxers.

The Bounce rapper, 23, suffered a shocking wardrobe malfunction which saw her bare all to the cameras as she readjusted her outfit.

She seemed to forget she was being photographed as she lifted up her dress, seemingly to check everything was in order 'down below', and exposed her miniscule flesh-coloured pants.

Azalea certainly wasn't afraid to flash the flesh in her revealing dress, which she topped off with red platform heels and a slick curled ponytail.

Style aside, she seemed to get the colour of her ensemble bang on trend, as most stars seemed to opt for black at Sunday night's EMAs.

Katy Perry, Ellie Goulding and Rita Ora all joined the Australian rapper in choosing outfits in the classic shade.

Goulding continued her penchant for wearing 
very little to high-profile events as she opted for
a daring sheer lace gown as she hit the red carpet.

The British singer, 26, dared
to bare in the totally see-through number, proudly 
flaunting her black bra and pants which were revealed beneath.

The Burn hitmaker wore her long blonde locks hanging in loose waves around her shoulders, while opting for natural, dewy make-up.

Meanwhile, Rita Ora opted for a relatively low-key look considering her usual wacky and wild sartorial tastes.
The 22-year-old singer turned on the old Hollywood glamour in a 
plunging black gown with a thigh-high split, featuring a sexy scooped 
back.

Showcasing her recently-dyed white platinum locks, the British 
star injected a welcome pop of colour to her ensemble with a slick of 
pillar-box red lipstick and dramatic eyeliner flicks

Katy 
Perry, 29, also went for black as she wore a fishnet skater dress paired
with chunky Chanel jewellery and red lips to collect her Best Female 
gong.

But she arrived in an
altogether more prim and elegant ensemble and changed again to perform,
bringing us to our third style lesson of the night: multiple outfit 
changes are now compulsory.

In her first outfit of the night, the Roar singer looked the picture of ladylike chic in a
satin fishtail pencil dress featuring
a conservative high neck and flattering knee-length hem.

She completed her look 
with a pair of salmon pink platform sandals and a pretty jewelled 
headband as she smiled for the cameras, before embarking on two outfit changes.

Iggy Azalea, born Amethyst Kelly, also opted for three different outfits.

Arriving in her skimpy thigh-split number, the Work rapper later changed into skinny leather trousers and plunging top, and then again into a space age silver stage outfit with matching lace-up knee-high boots to perform with Robin Thicke.

Elsewhere, Laura Whitmore showed that the mini is still in for Autumn/Winter as she posed up a storm in a classy white number.

The red carpet presenter looked positively showstopping as she paraded her seemingly endless pins in a daringly thigh-skimming minidress.

Featuring a flattering peplum detail, the strapless number was adorned with a dramatic lace and feather detail, which certainly ensured the Irish beauty stood out from the crowd as she hit the red carpet.

But Laura, 28, was disappointed that she wasn't able to get changed three times throughout her presenting stint as planned (as per the trend).

She had to jet off straight to Australia after fronting her segment of the awards to prepare for her next job on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.

Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'I had three outfit choices for tonight, but sadly I won't be changing as I'm flying straight out to Australia.'

Adding even more height to her seemingly endless legs in a pair of black strappy sandals, Laura completed her striking look with her signature winged eyeliner and plum lips, while wearing her blonde locks tied back loosely from her face.

One Direction were recognised for their winning style on Sunday as member Harry Styles scooped the Best Look gong.

The band also took home the awards for Best Pop and Best UK & Ireland Act.

Miley Cyrus won Best Video for her controversial Wrecking Ball montage, while Katy Perry was named Best Female and Justin Bieber took home Best Male.

Eminem received both the Global Icon and Best Hip Hop awards, and Bruno Mars' Locked Out Of Heaven was given the Best Song gong.

Elsewhere, 30 Seconds To Mars were named Best Alternative Act, while Macklemore and Ryan Lewis took home the Best New Act award.
