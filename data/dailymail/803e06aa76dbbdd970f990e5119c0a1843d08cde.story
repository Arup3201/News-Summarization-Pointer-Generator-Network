A gravely ill mother has put up billboards across Tampa Bay, Florida in a desperate attempt to find a kidney donor.

Devon Carver, 34, has type 1 diabetes and has been suffering from complete kidney failure since 2010.

After a double organ transplant of her kidney and pancreas in September proved unsuccessful, the Lithia mother-of-one now urgently needs to find a living donor to replace the rejected kidney.

Desperate: After two rejected transplants since her kidney failure of 2010, Mrs Carver now urgently needs a new one

Last week Mrs Carver had all her toes and parts of her feet amputated and is currently spending 12 hours at night on complete dialysis in her home.

Thanks to an anonymous donator Mrs Carver now appear on billboards along Tampa Bay highways hugging her 12-year-old son David captioned ‘Local mother needs living kidney donor’.

Mrs Carver has been living with diabetes since she was a toddler and has had two failed transplants so far.

‘It's like every time you think you've conquered something or you're somewhere where you need to be. Something else happens and you don't know what to do,’ she told 10 News.

Highway help: Mrs Carver and her family hope that the billboards will lead to more donations to help pay for medical costs and to finding a new kidney for her

Over 100,000 people in the United States are on the waiting list for an organ.

More than 30,000 operations are carried out each year but despite an increase in donations in recent years, it cannot keep up with the demand.

Every day 18 Americans die waiting for an organ.

Under current legislation an organ donation can only be carried out with the consent of the donator or immediate family.

Mrs Carver hopes that the billboards will attract a matching organ donor and financial aid for her treatments.

She estimates that $20,000 alone is needed for her foot prosthetics.

‘We need so much more than what we have. So much more than what we have. And we will take anything we can,’ she said.

Unfortunately, even if a donor was to step forward today, Mrs Carver will have to wait a further three months on full dialysis until she has made full recovery from the operations to her feet.
