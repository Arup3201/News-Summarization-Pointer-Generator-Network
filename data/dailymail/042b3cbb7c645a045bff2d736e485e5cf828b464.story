Car makers around the world have, for decades, regarded the appropriate place to put airbags as on the inside of their vehicles.

Now a team of Japanese researchers have turned that received knowledge on its head with their latest invention - an electric car covered in cushions.

Humanix, a startup business affiliated with Hiroshima University, has recently revealed the golf cart-like vehicle, which is covered in airbag-like cushions that spring back into shape after absorbing impacts.

iSAVE YOU: The Japanese-designed electric car turns received wisdom about airbags on its head by putting shock absorbing cushions all around the outside of the vehicle

Mmm, soft: A man tests out the cushioning with his hand

The company, formed by researchers from the university, is set to bring the innovative vehicle to market - dubbed iSAVE YOU - for a mere 790,000 yen (about £6,000).

Professor Tsutomu Masujima, president of Humanix, told Japanese magazine Sponichi Annex: 'The car will be perfect for our rapidly ageing society and we've already has many enquiries from elderly and disabled people.'

The shock-absorbing cushions protecting the outside of the vehicle are made of sponge, covered with tent fabric. 

Every side of the car, except the roof and underbody, is fitted with the impact-absorbing pillows, particularly at the front and rear.

While the cars cushioning is intended to absorb the energy in the event of an impact, it's not clear how much this will contribute to passenger safety in a high speed crash.

But since the vehicle only has a top speed of about 30mph, it's unlikely to be too much of an issue.

The video below even shows how it can be driven into bystanders causing minimal harm.

A single charge will run the iSAVE YOU for 18 miles and it can be recharged from any regular household plug.

Apart from the vital safety aspect, the Humanix website claims that the biggest advantage of their vehicle is the ease with which it can be registered.

Because of its light structure, the iSAVE YOU can be registered in Japan as a trike and it only needs a single inspection by authorities.
