A schizophrenic mass murderer who believes he is the 'Prince of God' will be executed in Florida tonight after an appeals court lifted a last-minute stay that was based on his mental illness.

John Errol Ferguson, 64, will be put to death by lethal injection at Florida State Prison at 6pm on Tuesday, a State Department of Corrections spokesperson confirmed.

Ferguson has spent more than three decades on death row for eight brutal killings, including those of a teenage couple, in 1977 and 1978.

He was originally due to be executed on 
October 16, but it was delayed for a state judge to determine whether 
Ferguson was mentally competent to be put to death.

Life behind bars: John Errol Ferguson, 64, has been on Death Row for 34 years for killing eight people in the 1970s and will be put to death on Tuesday. His lawyers argue that he is mentally ill

After two days of testimony, including that from a panel of psychiatrists appointed by Gov. Rick Scott, the judge agreed Ferguson did understand why he was being executed.

But on Saturday, another South Florida judge issued a stay as Ferguson's lawyers continued to argue he is mentally ill and therefore cannot be executed.

Victim: He raped and shot Belinda Worley, 17, as she went for ice cream 
with her boyfriend in January 1978. Her boyfriend was also shot dead

'A man who thinks he is the immortal 
Prince of God and who believes he is incarcerated because of a Communist
plot quite clearly has no rational understanding of the effect of his 
looming execution and the reason for it,' his lawyer, Christopher Handman, said in a statement.

Lawyers added it was a 'cruel and unusual punishment' for a mentally ill man.

Yet now the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta have lifted the stay, ruling that U.S. Judge Daninel Hurley 'abused' his discretion on Saturday when he issued it.

Handman said he was disappointed the stay was lifted even though one of the three Appeals judges was against it. He said he is hopeful the Supreme Court will reverse the decision.

'There is no evidence that Mr. Ferguson has a rational understanding of the reason for, and effect of, his execution,' he said.

The lawyers argued that an inmate's awareness of his execution - a standard set in 2007 - is not enough and the inmate must have a 'rational understanding' - a higher standard
than 'awareness'.

His execution comes more than three decades after his horrific killing and raping spree in the 1970s.

When Ferguson was 21, he stole a deputy's gun and was going to shoot when the deputy 
reached for another gun and shot the man four times - including once in 
the head.

When he left hospital, 'he began to show serious mental 
instability, irrational thinking, unexplainable hostility and grossly 
impaired intelligence,' his lawyers said.

Legal wrangling: The death has been granted after judges ruled he is aware of why he is being executed

John Errol Ferguson was sentenced to death for eight killings in 1977 and 1978, although some investigators believe he killed even more.

May 1977: An elderly couple who were in the area for a funeral were found beaten, tied up and shot dead in their motel room. The gun was used in Ferguson's later crimes but he was not charged as there was no other corroborating evidence.

July 1977: With three others, Ferguson broke into a house and tied up eight people and shot them in the heads. Livingstone Stocker, 33, Michael Miller, 24, Henry Clayton, 35, John Holmes, 26, Gilbert Williams, 37, and Charles Cesar Stinson, 35, all died. Two survived: Johnnie Hall, 45, and Margaret Wooden, 24. He was convicted of the killings.

October 1977: Posing as a police officer, he shot two teenagers during an attempted robbery. They survived.

January 1978: Shot and killed Brian Glenfeldt, 17, on his way to get ice cream with his girlfriend, Belinda Worley. Belinda, 17, was raped and also shot. He was convicted of the killings.

In May 1977, an elderly couple who were in the area for a funeral were 
found beaten, tied up and shot dead in their motel room.

While Ferguson 
was never convicted of these murders, the same handgun was used in a 
later crime of which he was found guilty.

The crime was the slaying of the 'Carol City Six' in a home-invasion robbery in July 1977 - the worst mass murder in Dade history at the time.

With two others, Ferguson entered a home under the guise of electrical
worker and tied up eight people, aged between 24 and 45, before 
shooting them in the heads. Two survived.

Three months later, Ferguson posed as a police officer and shot two teenagers during an attempted robbery but again the couple survived.

Then in January 1978, he shot and killed Brian Glenfeldt, 17, and 
Belinda Worley, 17, as they stopped off at a lover's lane on the way to 
get ice cream after leaving a Christian youth meeting.

Investigators said Ferguson had shot Brian in the head before chasing Belinda from the car and raping her. She was found shot dead in a wooded area.

Detectives found that the gun used to kill the young couple had been 
stolen from the Carol City home. Four months after, police tracked down 
Ferguson and arrested him.

Six months later, he was found guilty in two separate cases of the six 
killings and the murder of the couple and sentenced to death.

'He was a pretty vicious man,' retired Judge Robert 
Kaye, who put Ferguson on Death Row in 1978, told the Miami Herald. 'We had 
pretty good information that he killed at least 12 people.'

Fate: Ferguson will be put to death in Florida State Prison by lethal injection at 6pm on Tuesday

Over the years, Ferguson's lawyers have wrangled with the courts to throw out his death sentence, while two of his three 1977 accomplices have already been executed.

In 1982, the Florida Supreme Court threw out the death sentence due to his mental illness, but the following year he was sentenced to death again - leading to years more of failed appeals.

Michael Worley, Belinda's brother and only surviving relative, told The Miami Herald that he is upset over years of delays, and saddened that his mother is no longer alive to witness the execution.

'Outrageous is the fact that for 34 years, our tax dollars have been keeping Ferguson alive. Free food, medical care and the ability to communicate with his loved ones and lawyers,' he said.

'My sister was brutally killed at the age of 17. Her murder shattered our entire family. Life was never the same.'
