Newcastle are interested in MK Dons wonderkid Dele Alli.

The 18-year-old midfielder is being courted by a number of the Premier League's big guns - Liverpool and Manchester City included. 

But despite not having a manager in place, the Magpies want to land Alli this month and are set to make an approach for the youngster.

Bakary Sako is wanted by Tony Pulis as the West Bromwich Albion head coach considers a bold move for the Wolverhampton Wanderers winger.

Pulis is determined to add pace and width to his team and the 26-year-old fits the bill having scored seven goals in 27 games for West Brom’s arch rivals this season.

Sako only has six months left on his contract and Kenny Jackett has spoken about potentially doing a deal if a large enough bid comes in from a Premier League club.

Real Madrid have no plans to let midfielder Asier Illarramendi leave in the January transfer window and he remains an important part of the European champions' squad, coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Friday.

Illarramendi, 24, joined from Real Sociedad for a fee of £23.5m in July 2013 as a long-term replacement for Xabi Alonso but even though Alonso has moved on Illarramendi has been unable to hold down a starting place.

The imminent arrival of another defensive midfielder, Brazilian Lucas Silva, has prompted speculation Illarramendi will leave, with Real's struggling La Liga rivals Athletic Bilbao and English Premier League side Arsenal reportedly interested in signing him.

West Brom are closing in on the signing of Shola Ameobi.

The former Newcastle striker is available on a free transfer after leaving Turkish side Gaziantep.

The Baggies have agreed a deal with the 33-year-old as head coach Tony Pulis looks to beef up his forward line.

The 30-year-old Ivory Coast international arrives from Serie A side Palermo.

Jose Mourinho admitted he would be willing to sell Andre Schurrle if a 'phenomenal' offer was made for the midfielder.

Mourinho said the German, who he insisted he wants to remain at Chelsea, would be selected for Saturday's's FA Cup fourth round match against Bradford but conceded he may be forced to sell.

The principle is that we would like him (Schurrle) to stay,' said Mourinho.

'The question is not to be allowed or not allowed. The question is to have a phenomenal offer and a player to be super keen of accept a new challenge in his career. We don't want to sell our players.

'But for Shurrle to get a first team place he must start playing better than Eden Hazard and Willian.'

Arsenal could be set to miss out on signing Tolgay Arslan, who is close to agreeing terms with Besiktas.

The Hamburg defensive midfielder and his representatives are waiting on a decision from Arsene Wenger before finalising terms with the Turkish club.

Wenger has been monitoring the player, who is available for free in the summer but can discuss pre-contract terms with clubs outside of the Bundesliga now.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has confirmed that The Hammers are one of the clubs chasing Darren Fletcher but says they are yet to speak to the Manchester United midfielder.

Fletcher, who has made 342 appearances for the Red Devils since making his debut in 2003, has only six months left on his contract at Old Trafford and is struggling to establish himself under new boss Louis van Gaal.

Tony Pulis has admitted West Brom are in talks to sign the 30-year-old Scot and Allardyce hopes Fletcher will make a final decision soon.

West Brom are set to make a fresh offer for Nottingham Forest forward Michail Antonio.

The Championship club have already knocked back an initial attempt from Tony Pulis to snare the 24-year-old winger.

But the Baggies are preparing a second offer to sign the winger this month.

Pulis is finding difficulty in landing his first choice wing option Callum McManaman from Wigan and is exploring alternatives.

Queens Park Rangers' Matt Phillips, a player who has been scouted by Pulis in the past, is another option for WBA.

Crystal Palace are set to revisit their interest in Lille left-back Pape Souare as their move for Neil Taylor continues to drag on.

Souare was a target for the club prior to Neil Warnock's sacking, but the Eagles have since switched their attentions to Swansea's Taylor.

But Palace are struggling to agree a fee for the Wales international, already having a £4.5million offer rejected.

And Alan Pardew is considering turning to Souare in his attempts to land a new left-back.

Queens Park Rangers are also tracking the Frenchman, but will struggle to get a loan deal over the line due to their lack of finances.

M'Vila, who was once a target for Arsenal, is currently on loan at Inter Milan - but the Italians are willing to cut the deal short.

Swans boss Garry Monk has cash to spend following the sale of Wilfried Bony to Manchester City for £28million.

Arsenal will resist any offers for Nacho Monreal this month after Atletico Bilbao enquired about the defender.

The La Liga club have shown an interest in the Gunners' versatile defender, but were told he will not be leaving the Emirates Stadium.

Monreal has been an important figure for Arsene Wenger's side this season, playing regularly at central defence and left-back for the injury hit Gunners.

Bilbao may return for Monreal in the summer when they'll have a better chance of nabbing the Spaniard.

Tottenham are showing an interest in Feyenoord winger Jean-Paul Boetius.

Spurs are having major difficulty in shifting some of their deadwood out of the club this month, a struggle that is restricting Mauricio Pochettino's attempts to sign new players.

It is hoped the departure of Kyle Naughton to Swansea will trigger the start of a number of deals in and out of Spurs before the transfer deadline.

And Dutch forward Boetius, 20, is a player interesting the North London club.

Serie A side Torino are in for Queens Park Rangers wideman Adel Taarabt.

Meanwhile, in the Championship, Bolton want Cardiff striker Adam le Fondre and have opened talks over a loan with a view to a £1.5m deal.

Huddersfield were also interested in the 28-year-old.

Dani Osvaldo offered to QPR after Southampton outcast goes AWOL during loan spell at Inter Milan

According to reports in Spain Real Madrid have won the race to sign Cruzeiro midfielder Lucas Silva, who had also been linked with a move to Arsenal.

News of Silva's arrival will delight fans at the Bernabeu after he revealed Madrid were one of his two favourite teams in Europe - along with Spanish rivals Barcelona.

Mark Pougatch is to replace Adrian Chiles at ITV's lead football host with immediate effect.

Pougatch will present ITV's next live match which is the Chelsea vs Paris Saint-Germain Champions League game next month.

Chiles' four-year contract expires this year but ITV will not comment on the reasons for his departure.

Arsenal may have struggled for trophies in the last decade, but surely with this XI they would have been conquering Europe for many years.

Angel di Maria is the latest of a long list of players who Arsene Wenger admitted narrowly missed out on a move to north London.

The team may be top heavy, and would most definitely be high on entertainment and slightly creaky at the back, while bringing trophies and goals to the Emirates Stadium.

Chelsea have seen an opening bid of £16million rejected for Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Douglas Costa, according to the player himself.

Costa confirmed to local press on Shakhtar’s South American tour that Chelsea’s initial offer had been rejected – but said he would speak to his club to try to push a move through.

‘It’s a dream to play for Chelsea, a unique chance. I will try to negotiate,’ he told Brazil’s Globo Esporte.

Ukrainian champions Shakhtar are known to difficult to negotiate with, making it perhaps unsurprising that Chelsea’s bid, understood to be £16m, was rejected.

QPR have been offered Corinthians striker Alexandre Pato.

The 25-year-old, who previously played for Italian giants AC Milan, could make the move to west London in this transfer window.

Pato is on loan from Corinthians at Sao Paulo - where he has scored 12 goals in 30 appearances since joining earlier this year.

Everton forward Samuel Eto'o is in Italy for a medical with Sampdoria as he looks to seal his move to the Serie A club. The former Chelsea and Barcelona man flew out of England on Thursday and is set to complete his transfer by the end of Friday.Roberto Martinez initially said he wanted Eto'o to stay at Goodison Park but now seems resigned to losing the 33-year-old. Representatives of Italian club Sampdoria came to London in an attempt to speed up the transfer due to concerns it wouldn't be completed before the February 2 deadline.

Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny's position has been cast into further doubt after it emerged the club are monitoring Fiorentina goalkeeper Norberto Neto.

Sportsmail revealed earlier this month that the Gunners will make a new No 1 a summer priority.

And club scouts have made checks on Brazil keeper Neto - who is also a target for Liverpool and Juventus - ahead of a potential summer move.

David de Gea’s Manchester United future was thrown into doubt on Thursday night as his agent failed to rule out a move to Real Madrid in the summer.De Gea has 18 months left on his contract and has yet to agree new terms to stay at Old Trafford as he takes stock of his future with Real watching developments.His agent Jorge Mendes, who also represents Cristiano Ronaldo, was asked by Spanish media if he could see the 24-year-old moving to Madrid.'David is amazing, he’s brilliant,’ the Portuguese agent told Marca. ‘He’s a Man United player and has a contract there. You have to respect that but things change every five minutes.’
