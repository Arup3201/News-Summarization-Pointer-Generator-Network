A police investigator says a Pennsylvania man initially laughed when told that authorities planned to search his property for bodies, then became nervous and repeatedly glanced at the area where police later found two corpses.

State police Lt. Richard L. Krawetz testified Wednesday at the trial of Hugo Selenski, who's charged with strangling a pharmacist and the pharmacist's girlfriend in 2002.

Krawetz, the trial's first witness, says Selenski denied that any bodies were buried in the yard and even offered to help dig.

Nervous? A police officer testified Wednesday that Hugo Seleneski initially laughed when told that authorities planned to search his property for bodies, then became nervous and repeatedly glanced at the area where police later found two corpses

Selenski has pleaded not guilty to killing Michael Kerkowski and Tammy Fassett. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

Authorities found at least five sets of human remains in Selenski's yard in 2003. Selenski was acquitted in 2006 of killing two other people but convicted of abusing their corpses. 

The career criminal brutally beat and strangled a pharmacist and the pharmacist's girlfriend as part of a plot to steal tens of thousands of dollars from the druggist, who had been operating a prescription drug ring and was flush with cash, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday.

Hugo Selenski needed about $10,000 to cover a check his girlfriend had written to purchase a house. He got that and far more, Luzerne County Assistant District Attorney Jarrett Ferentino told jurors in an opening statement that portrayed Selenski as greedy, manipulative and extremely violent.

The trial opened nearly a dozen years after investigators found at least five sets of human remains buried in Selenski's yard. He is charged with strangling two of the victims: Michael Kerkowski, a pharmacist who had called Selenski his best friend, and Kerkowski's girlfriend, Tammy Lynn Fassett, who prosecutors said was in the wrong place at the wrong time when Selenski and a co-conspirator showed up at Kerkowski's house in May 2002. 

Victims: Selenski is charged with strangling Michael Kerkowski, a pharmacist who had called Selenski his best friend, and Kerkowski's girlfriend, Tammy Lynn Fassett, who prosecutors said was in the wrong place at the wrong time when Selenski and a co-conspirator showed up at Kerkowski's house in May 2002

Grim: At least five bodies were uncovered on Selenski's property. He's only been accused of killing two of the. He was acquitted of killing two others and a fifth was never identified

Selenski, 41, has pleaded not guilty to homicide, robbery and related counts. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. 

Ferentino said Selenski and his co-conspirator, Paul Weakley, bound the victims and covered their eyes with duct tape. Kerkowski was beaten with a rolling pin, and he and Fassett were strangled with flex ties.

Selenski operated in 'a world of manipulation, a world of violence. You will hear it's a world of greed. You will hear it's a world that leaves its victims bound and broken,' Ferentino said. 'What you hear will shock you. It will horrify you. And it will break your heart. But it happened.'

Selenski and Weakley tortured Kerkowski into revealing the location of tens of thousands of dollars he'd hidden in the house, Ferentino said. After the killings, Selenski stole tens of thousands more that Kerkowski had given to his father for safekeeping — at one point pointing a gun at the father and threatening him, Ferentino said.

Selenski blew through $100,000 of the pharmacist's money in three months, Ferentino said.

Selenski, who is already serving a decades-long prison sentence in a home invasion and robbery, grimaced, shook his head and whispered to his attorneys throughout the prosecutor's presentation.

His attorney, Bernard Brown, pinned all the blame on Weakley, who avoided a death sentence by pleading guilty to federal charges in connection with the killings and is scheduled to testify against Selenski.

Bury: Selenski allegedly strangled the couple and hid the bodies behind a high school before enlisting the help of an accomplice to bury the bodies on his property in 2002. 

Sentence: Selenski is currently serving an up to 65-year sentence for robbery. In 2003, his alleged co-conspirator led police to his Pennsylvania home where five bodies were found on the property

Brown told jurors that Weakley's story to police shifted over time, and he contended the evidence points to Weakley as the sole culprit.

Kerkowski had pleaded guilty to selling more than 330,000 doses of painkillers without prescriptions and was awaiting sentencing when he and Fassett disappeared.

Weakley led police to Selenski's property north of Wilkes-Barre in June 2003. There, they found the corpses of Kerkowski and Fassett in a shallow grave, plastic ties around their necks.

Weakley knew the location of the bodies, Brown said Wednesday, 'because he put them there.'

Investigators searched the rest of the yard and found additional bodies. Authorities have long said they found at least five sets of human remains, and maybe more, but only four victims have ever been identified.

Prosecutors took an initial crack at Selenski in 2006, when he stood trial in the slayings of the other two victims who were identified. Prosecutors contended Selenski shot the men - both of them suspected drug dealers - then burned the remains.

After a jury acquitted Selenski of one homicide and deadlocked on another, prosecutors immediately charged him in the deaths of Kerkowski and Fassett.

A few months after his 2003 arrest, Selenski escaped from prison using a rope fashioned from bed sheets and remained on the loose for three days before turning himself in.
