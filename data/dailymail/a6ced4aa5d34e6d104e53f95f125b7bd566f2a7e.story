An explosives fanatic who lost several fingers after accidentally blowing up a homemade pipe bomb in his pregnant fiancee's living room was jailed for three years yesterday.

Martin Middleton, 26, had been constructing the device for a 'thrill' when it suddenly exploded in his face causing him to lose part of his hand.

His former girlfriend Kay Emerson, who was five months pregnant, was in the living room stripping wallpaper at the time.

Martin Middleton was jailed for three years after he exploded the pipe bomb feet from his then pregnant fiancee Kay Emerson (pictured together)

The explosives fanatic wanted a tattoo of an exploding bomb, left, and a photo of Middleton was posted on social networking sites with facial burns, right, which are thought to have been caused by a previous bomb

She was not injured in the blast but fragments of the bomb were found embedded in the walls and woodwork of the living room.

Yesterday Middleton was sentenced after pleading guilty to causing an 
explosion likely to endanger life or injure property under Explosive 
Substances Act 1883.

Middleton made the pipe bomb in January this year and hit it 10 times until it exploded.

He dialled 999 before running from the housing association property that he shared with his fiancee in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

He was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital 
where he was treated for injuries to his left hand and underwent 
extensive plastic surgery. His hand will never function normally again.

Previously, Middleton had posted a pencil drawing of a tattoo design that he wanted, depicting an exploding bomb with the word 'kaboom' in the middle, on his Facebook page.

Bomb disposal experts were sent to the scene after Middleton exploded the pipe bomb

But he told friends: 'mum wont let me have a pipe bomb on my arm i get it done'.

About 40 homes had to be evacuated 
while police and bomb disposal teams searched the area.

Miss Emerson told police she heard a loud bang and saw a flash before seeing Middleton running out of the back door and his hand was pouring with blood.

When he was arrested Middleton said he often made the £10 bombs because he got a 'thrill' out of it.

Judge Timothy 
Stead, sitting at Bolton Crown Court, told Middleton : 'You have caused yourself permanent pain, 
disfigurement and disability, but mercifully no physical harm to anyone 
else.

'I think you do now know how dangerous your actions were. If you haven't learned your lesson, you never will.

About 40 homes in Lea Gate, Bolton, had to be evacuated after Middleton exploded the bomb

'I'm
told you have learned your lesson and the evidence seems to suggest 
that's so. You have suffered because of your own actions and I make some
reductions to allow for that.'

One woman eye witness to the incident said she saw him run out with blood pouring from his hand.

She said: 'I saw a man slumped over the fence clutching his arm with his hand virtually hanging off. It looked really bad and he looked very pale.'

Middleton was also ordered to pay a £120 victim surcharge.
