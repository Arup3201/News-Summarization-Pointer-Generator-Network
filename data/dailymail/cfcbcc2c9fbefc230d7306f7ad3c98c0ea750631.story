Sergio Novarette, 27, originally from Mexico, has been jailed for 26 years

An illegal immigrant murdered his pregnant girlfriend before writing ‘die b***h’ above her head after she told him to leave their home, a court heard yesterday.

Violent Sergio Novarette, 27, originally from Mexico, battered Sarah O’Neill when she demanded he was gone by the morning after their relationship broke down.

His visa had run out and he was in the country illegally. 

When Sarah told him it was over he beat, strangled and raped her.

Mother-of-one Sarah, 22, suffered serious head injuries, including fractures to her jaw and eye sockets and was left sprawled in a pool of her own blood.

She was found on the bed of the flat the couple shared in Speedwell, Bristol, with the words 'morir perra' - die b***h in Spanish - written above her.

Yesterday, Novarette was jailed for 26 years after pleading guilty to the murder which happened on January 8.

Mr Justice Blake dubbed the killer an 'obsessive, jealous and violent' at Bristol Crown Court.

He said: 'You remained in the premises and behaved in an obsessive, jealous, violent and obstructive manner, even though you know Miss O’Neill wanted you to leave.

'You exploited her generosity and hospitality and horribly used it and affection against her.

'The evil language you used and the words you scrawled on the bedside above her broken and battered body are a testament to you behaviour at the time.'

The court heard Novarette first arrived in the UK on a six month visitors visa in December 2012.

Despite his time having run out, he remained in the UK where he met Sarah during a busker’s event in Bristol’s Bear Pit, in July 2013.

The pair quickly struck up a relationship and he moved in with the pretty brunette not long after.

However, violence quickly began to emerge in the relationship and alcoholic Novarette left Sarah with a number of cuts and bruises.

The court heard Sarah told a number of friends their relationship was over towards the end of 2013, but she did not want to kick him out as he had no where to go.

Adam Vaitilingam, prosecuting, said: 'A neighbour, Lorna Johnson, recalls visiting Sarah sometime before Christmas 2013 following reports of screaming coming from the flat.

'She said Sarah was crying and had purple bruises around her throat. She told her something had happened the previous evening but did not say what.

'On another occasion the defendant also admitted pushing Sarah over, causing large purple bruises, when it was witnessed by a friend.

'Sarah told friends the defendant would also have sex with her even when she told him no.

'Sarah’s friends knew she wanted the relationship over and wanted him to leave her, but the defendant had stayed at the flat because she did not want to "just kick him out on the street'.

'She told another friend Novarette had been violent towards her, and was obviously desperate for the defendant to leave and was very scared of him.'

The couple finally came to blows after Sarah revealed she was in the early stages of pregnancy but did not want to keep the baby because of his violent nature.

On January 7, the day before her murder, Sarah was staying at a friend’s when Novarette, who had been out drinking all day, sent a series of text messages calling her a 'baby killer' and a 'f***king whore'.

In response Sarah told Novarette to pack his things and leave by the morning, before leaving her friend’s house at 12.30am to 'sort things out' with him.

Her last text message to the friend, at 3.20am, confirmed that Novarette had agreed to leave the following morning and all was okay.

But, less than eight hours later, Novarette, who had a more than 350mg of alcohol in his blood at the time of his arrest, telephoned police to reveal his violent crime.

Mr Vaitilingam added: 'She was clothed from the waist up but her upper clothing was pushed up exposing both of her breasts.

'Blood was smeared all over her body and she was pronounced dead at the scene. The words ‘die bitch’ were written in Spanish in red ink on the head board of the bed.

'The defendant accepted it was his writing, he had clearly written it that night.'

Hours after the horrific attack, drunken Novarette rang a friend to tell him he had 'gone too far' and 'crossed the line' before calling police to confess his crime.

When officers arrived he told them 'I choked her' and later asked, 'how long do you get for murder?' when he arrived at the station.

Richard Smith QC, defending, said his client had a serious problem with alcohol and had drunk a 'huge amount even by his own standards of drinking' on the night of the murder.

He also said Novarette told officer he had taken ketamine, although no evidence was found, which could have caused him to make a 'terrible' misjudgement of people.

When he was arrested the following morning he was four-and-a-half times the drink drive limit. 

He had also taken horse tranquilliser Ketamine and only called police when still under the influence of the drug.

Sarah also miscarried as she died in a pool of blood, the court heard.

The court heard that Novarette had sex with her either at the time of death or shortly afterwards before leaving her body in the bedroom.

The killer was living in the UK illegally after coming to the country from Mexico in December 2012 and had a long history of alcoholism.

Caring Sarah had taken him in as he was unable to earn money legally.

She had a 21-month-old son by a former partner and fell pregnant again by Novarette in late 2013.

In a victim impact statement read out in court, Sarah’s mother Vivian O’Neill said: 'At a time like this words are hard to find. 

'We are heartbroken and devastated at the loss of Sarah. I am taking medication for the grief and anxiety.'

Mr Justice Blake said Novarette will face deportation to Mexico.

The pair quickly struck up a relationship and he moved in with the pretty brunette not long after

He said: 'Sarah was attractive, loving and generous, a free spirit who was accepting of all people.

'She had a warm relationship with her family.'

Detective Inspector Julie Mackay said: 'The attack on Sarah was a savage one which left her with horrific injuries. 

'It was the worst kind of betrayal from a man who out of kindness she continued to allow to share her home despite them recently separating.

'Sarah’s murder has torn her family apart and I know that it will take them a long, long time to adjust to a life without Sarah in it. 

'I hope that the significant sentence handed to Novarette gives them some comfort and helps them to continue rebuilding their lives.'
