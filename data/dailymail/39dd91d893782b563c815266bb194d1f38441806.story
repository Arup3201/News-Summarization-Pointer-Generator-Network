The furious granddaughter of a First World War hero today called for church officials to remove a shed which was built over his grave.

Private Walter Perry, of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, was a member of the Territorial Army and signed up to fight for his country in November 1914.

The soldier - from the Northamptonshire Regiment 1st Battalion - was wounded during the Battle of Givenchy in France just one month later, and died of septicaemia in January 1915 at the age of 34.

Removal plea: A shed was built over the grave of Private Walter Perry in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire

Location: Pte Perry's granddaughter has visited his grave at St Mary's Church (pictured) since she was a child

His granddaughter, Ann Dallas, 72, has been visiting his grave at St Mary's Church in Bletchley since she was a child.

She has recalled how her mother Winifred Chandler was shocked when she went to visit the grave 64 years ago and found a brick triangular building sitting where her father's grave should be.

At the time builders had even moved Pte Perry’s headstone without the family's consent to make way for the shed.

The headstone now sits less than 4ft away from the shed wall - and Pte Perry was more than 6ft tall.

Church officials are said to have continued to refuse to remove the ramshackle structure, which also covers Pte Perry’s grandparents' graves - despite it being derelict and covered in rubbish.

'Dark and dank': Pte Perry's granddaughter says the area is 'full of beer bottles, rubbish and even human excrement'

Pte Perry’s widow Amy, who died in 1954, had purchased the adjoining plot - but when she died she had to be buried in Reading, Berkshire, because of the shed.

'It would be wonderful if, during this WW1 centenary year, the shed could be demolished and my grandfather could be brought out of this horrible dark place and into the light once again'

Mrs Dallas who is a former publishing assistant of Aldeburgh, Suffolk, hopes with all the centenary commemorations for the Great War this week that her grandfather's will be given due recognition.

When her mother died at the age of 93 in 2006, she promised to keep fighting to save Pte Perry’s grave.

She said: ‘It's a dark, dank and horrible building that obviously attracts the wrong kind of people.  It's full of beer bottles, rubbish and even human excrement.

‘To me it is painful beyond belief that my grandfather's grave should be treated this way. I just don't want to be the third generation of my family to not see this resolved.

‘I believe it is a criminal offence to desecrate a war grave. He fought for our country and his grave have been treated with no respect whatsoever.

'It's a dark, dank and horrible building that obviously attracts the wrong kind of people.  It's full of beer bottles, rubbish and even human excrement'

Ann Dallas

‘My family had lived in Bletchley since the 16th century and there are seven relatives buried in that area.  But my grandmother had to be buried miles away because the shed took up her plot. Every time my mother and I tried to do something about this we got the brush off.

‘It would be wonderful if, during this WW1 centenary year, the shed could be demolished and my grandfather could be brought out of this horrible dark place and into the light once again.’

Iain Stewart, Conservative MP for Milton Keynes South, has joined her campaign. He said: ‘I was very saddened to learn that the grave of Private Walter Perry has not been treated with the respect it deserves over many years.

Official documents: These papers provide details of what was actually inscribed on the soldier's headstone

‘As the world commemorates the centenary of the outbreak of World War One and remembers the ultimate sacrifice that so many made, now is the time to put right this wrong.

'We are saddened by the distress that has been caused to this family and the parish priest has offered to meet Mrs Dallas to discuss her concerns and find the right way forward'

Right Reverend Alan Wilson, Bishop of Buckingham

‘I shall do what I can to liaise between St Mary's Church and the family and hopefully this can be sorted out.’

Mrs Dallas has even offered to pay all the costs of demolishing the building, re-landscaping the area and maintaining it in the future.

Milton Keynes Council maintains the cemetery but the Diocese of Oxford is still responsible for the shed.

A council spokesman said: ‘Our job is simply to maintain this churchyard, but we are extremely sympathetic about this situation and we will do anything we can to help resolve it.’

Remembered: The soldier, from the Northamptonshire Regiment 1st Battalion, was wounded during the Battle of Givenchy in France the next month and died of septicaemia in January 1915 at the age of 34

A spokesman for the Right Reverend Alan Wilson, the Bishop of Buckingham, said he has contacted Mrs Dallas about Pte Perry’s grave.

'As the world commemorates the centenary of the outbreak of World War One and remembers the ultimate sacrifice that so many made, now is the time to put right this wrong'

Iain Stewart, Milton Keynes South MP

She added that he had been in touch with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and Milton Keynes Council to resolve the problem.

The Rt Revd Wilson said: ‘We are saddened by the distress that has been caused to this family and the parish priest has offered to meet Mrs Dallas to discuss her concerns and find the right way forward.’

Pte Perry’s entry on the CWGC website confirms that his death was on January 7, 1915. It also says he was the ‘son of George and Elizabeth Perry; husband of Amy Perry, of 6 Station Rd, Bletchley. Born at Water Eaton, Bletchley’.
