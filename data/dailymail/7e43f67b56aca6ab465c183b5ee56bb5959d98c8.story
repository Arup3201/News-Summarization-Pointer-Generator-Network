Claims: Catriona Carter Jonas, the former events coordinator at Kellogg College, Oxford, told a tribunal she was called a 'wrinkly old bag' by a manager

An Oxford University events co-ordinator was described by her managers as a 'wrinkly old bag', an employment tribunal was told.

Catriona Carter Jonas, 53, said she received 'nasty treatment' from her superiors while working at the prestigious Kellogg College and was so depressed she would 'cry herself to sleep'.

Details of the alleged bullying emerged at Reading Tribunal Centre where Miss Carter Jonas is suing the Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University for discrimination on age grounds, unfair dismissal and the payment of outstanding wages.

Miss Carter Jonas, who worked at the college for six years, told the tribunal she had been bullied from January 2011 and once she left had 'no confidence in herself'.

She alleges former line manager Sarah Gauntlett called her a 'wrinkly old bag' and asked if she was strong enough to move furniture for events.

When Donna Lipsky took over as her manager in January 2012, Miss Carter Jonas said: 'As soon as Donna started her role it was clear that her intention was to manage me out.'

She claimed Mrs Lipsky was overly argumentative in a meeting shortly after taking over and refused to listen to Miss Carter Jonas’ concerns about her previous manager’s behaviour.

A month later, Miss Carter Jonas, from Wantage, Oxfordshire, said she walked past Mrs Lipsky’s office and overheard her saying to a colleague: 'We need someone cheaper, younger, stronger.'

'I was the only member of staff that had to move furniture around for events, therefore I needed to be reasonably strong and that is why I believe that comment was made about me,' she told the hearing.

She said that Mrs Lipsky attempted to increase her workload by up to 80 per cent without any recognition.

'She was trying to make my job more difficult for me so that I would make mistakes or resign,' she added.

Judge Robin Lewis heard that she was 
told to 'f**k off' by bursary staff member Samantha Williams, and heard Mrs 
Lipsky had claimed Miss Carter Jonas lied about taking time off sick 
with suspected appendicitis in April 2012.

Allegations: The hearing at Reading Tribunal Centre was also told that a senior member of staff said Miss Carter Jonas would 'sit on people' until she broke them

In June 2012, Miss Carter Jonas was taken to a disciplinary hearing for poor performance by Mrs Lipsky, which she labelled 'very strange' as the accusations were 'petty' or 'not true'.

She had previously been subject to a similar hearing in 2011, which she did not dispute.

Miss Carter Jonas was then given a final written warning, meaning she needed daily meetings with her manager to monitor performance.

'These were never good or constructive and I was either treated with contempt or completely ignored,' she added.

Prestigious: She was the events co-ordinator at Kellogg College for six years before leaving last year

Miss Carter Jonas submitted a grievance against Mrs Lipsky in July 2012 and appealed her warning, claiming two other employees had complained about her manager at the time.

Judge Lewis heard that further health problems followed as the disciplinary and grievance process continued.

'I was depressed and would cry myself to sleep on most nights. I was suffering from regular panic attacks, she said.

She claimed the grievance was not investigated properly and appealed its dismissal, but that was also rejected.

'The result of the appeal was the last straw, it forced me to resign. I couldn’t go back to Kellogg, I had no confidence in myself,' she said.

Alice Carse, representing Oxford University, told the hearing that Miss Carter Jonas had been mistaken regarding Mr Fraser’s comments that Mrs Lipsky would 'sit on people'.

She added that Miss Carter Jonas, referred to by colleagues as Mimi in some evidence, was 'making something out of nothing and that Mrs Lipsky had not in fact threatened her with dismissal in their January 2012 meeting.

'Did you ever consider that what Keith Fraser told you about her was untrue and was part of his own agenda?' she asked, to which Miss Carter Jonas said she took it as true.

Speaking of her original meeting in 2012 with Mrs Lipsky, Miss Carter Jonas said: 'Donna wagged her finger repeatedly at me, banned me from using Gabriele Del Monte, IT officer, to help me move furniture, changed my work hours and threatened to dismiss me by asking "do you still want this job?" in front of former manager Sarah Gauntlett.

The tribunal is expected to conclude today.
