Jess Rowles, 24, was left needing stitches to her lip and chin after allegedly being punched in the face by a taxi driver following a night out in Bristol on July 27

These photos show the horrific injuries a woman suffered after being punched in the face by a rogue taxi driver following a night out.

Jess Rowles, 24, said she was assaulted by the taxi driver in an 'isolated' street after she told him she didn't have enough money to pay the fare as he took her home on July 27.

She had enjoyed several drinks with a friend in Bristol city centre prior to the incident and was on her way home at about 2.30am when the taxi driver allegedly locked the doors before driving to the random street.

The insurance company worker said she realised during the drive home she didn't have enough money and asked the taxi driver to stop off at a cash point.

However, he ended up dropping the two young women off in the secluded street – miles from home – before allegedly assaulting Miss Rowles.

She said: 'We had £14 but he wanted £20 so we asked him to take us to a cash point.

'He refused, locked us in the cab and said he was going to take us back to where he collected us.

'But in fact he dumped us in (another road) which was dark, but to be honest we were just glad to be able to get out the cab.

'Then as we walked away he got something out the boot of his car and sprayed us with water.

'I went back to ask him why he had done that and it felt like he punched me in the face.

'There was certainly a lot of force because it knocked me to the ground and I hit my face on the kerb.'

The young women, from Shirehampton, Bristol, called the emergency services and police officers took Miss Rowles to hospital where she had several stitches to her lip and chin.

However, the cabbie - which the girls believe was run by Bristol City Council and had an Asian driver who was in his 20s– drove off and police have been unable to track it down.

Miss Rowles said she told the taxi driver she didn't have enough money to pay the fare as he took her home in Shirehampton, Bristol, and asked to be driven to a cash point. It was then he apparently punched her in the face

Avon and Somerset Police were informed of the incident but have now closed the investigation due to lack of evidence, infuriating Miss Rowles, who thinks they have done the 'bare minimum'.

A force spokesman said: 'A thorough and detailed investigation was carried out based on the limited information and evidence available.

'CCTV was checked but there was no film showing the incident or a good shot of the actual taxi.

'House-to-house investigations were also carried out and private CCTV checked but no relevant footage was found.

'Because Miss Rowles has a right to complain if she feels we have not carried out a thorough investigation, this has been reported to the force's professional standards department to review.'

Ms Rowles has now gained the support of her local MP, Wayne Harvey, who said: 'Seeing the photos of this horrific, violent and cowardly attack on Jess has left me feeling sickened.

Avon and Somerset Police has closed an investigation into the case which Miss Rowles blasted them for, saying they had done the 'bare minimum'. She now has the support of MPs who said the attack was 'cowardly'

'This is the second attack that has been brought to my attention regarding taxi drivers becoming violent and assaulting their passengers.

'With all the CCTV we have in Bristol this should be being picked up.'

MP Charlotte Leslie added: 'Taxis should be seen as a place of safety for people, not a place where you risk being assaulted.

'It seems sad but perhaps we need to encourage people to note down taxi licence numbers when they get in a taxi.'
