A former detective was being questioned today on suspicion of murdering his policewoman partner.

Peter Foster, 35, was arrested a few hours before the body of Heather Cooper, who gave birth to a daughter last month, was found in Blackdown Woods, near Lurgashall in West Sussex.

Murder squad officers are investigating whether the couple’s other child, a three-year-old boy, witnessed her death.

Police arrived at the family’s £700,000 rented home at 11.30pm on Sunday after a relative dialled 999.

They discovered the woman detective’s body concealed among undergrowth four miles away.

Forensic officers in white overalls last night conducted a finger-tip search of the wood and a Home 
Office pathologist was called in to examine the body before it was taken
away.

Bags of evidence were also removed from the couple’s home in Haslemere, Surrey.

Search: Police officers comb the woodland area near where the 30-year-old's body was found looking for clues and evidence

A police cordon is still in place at the scene where body was discovered concealed among undergrowth as investigations continue

Today police investigating the killing urged witnesses to come forward.

A spokesman said: 'Officers are keen 
to hear from anyone who may have seen a silver BMW estate in the area of
West Street, Haslemere, and Tennyson’s Lane near the Blackdown Woods 
car park between the hours of 11am and 11pm on Sunday, 16 October.'

Detective Chief Inspector Nick May, 
of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'We are continuing work
to build up a picture of events on Sunday and I am urging anyone who 
may have seen this vehicle during that day in these locations to contact
police.

'Your information could prove vital.

Officers have now been granted a further 36 hours to question the suspect.

A family friend said Foster, who left 
the police for unknown reasons, had been devastated by the murder of his
father in Sierra Leone.

Murder probe: Forensic investigators are examining this house in Haslemere, Surrey, tonight after a woman police officer's body was found in woodland four miles away

‘It was a case of wrong place, wrong 
time and the man who shot him was imprisoned,’ said the friend. ‘But it 
affected his whole family hugely. Peter was particularly upset.’

He added: ‘How much tragedy does one family have to deal with?

‘It is so shocking and his family are 
devastated. Their children are so young, their little girl is only just a
month old, and we are very concerned for them.

‘Peter left the police some time ago, before the death of his father.

‘He found it very difficult to deal with. But the idea he could kill the mother of his two children is just unbelievable.’

A neighbour said: ‘I think he was in an elite unit of the police.’

Fears: The police investigation began after officers were notified of concerns for their colleague's safety

Another said: ‘Heather gave birth to a
little girl just a few weeks ago. I remember seeing her walking around 
heavily pregnant. They have a little boy who is about three.’  

After 
leaving Surrey Police, Foster set up a plumbing and heating firm from 
his house, which is opposite a police station.

A website promoting the company says 
it is family run and there are testimonials from letting agencies, pub 
landlords and homeowners.

A job advert published in April offered a ‘competitive salary, company vehicle and company bonus scheme’.

Foster had spent more than five years 
with the small and close-knit Surrey force, becoming a detective 
constable working on violent crimes.

Investigation: At this stage it is not known how the policewoman died

Police say another man called Peter Foster, a detective inspector, currently works for the force.

Miss Cooper was a detective constable 
with Guildford CID and worked on several high-profile cases including an
attempted kidnapping last year. An assistant at Waitrose in Haslemere 
said Foster had shopped for groceries there on Sunday afternoon.

‘He just seemed perfectly normal,’ he 
said. ‘He was not behaving out of the ordinary or acting in any way that
would cause alarm. I just cannot believe it.’

A post-mortem examination was expected to take place today at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford.

Police were called to the family's home in West Street, Haslemere on Sunday and the woman's body was found four miles away in Tennyson Lane in Blackdown Woods

A Surrey Police spokesman said: 
‘Following inquiries officers went to Blackdown Woods near Lurgashall, 
where a search of the woodland led to the discovery of the body of a 
woman in her 30s.

‘Police have cordoned off the area of 
woodland and forensic officers are on site carrying out inquiries. The 
woman’s body has not yet been formally identified.

‘A 35-year-old man from Haslemere has 
been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the incident and
remains in custody.’

The woods in which Miss Cooper’s body was found are in a part of the South Downs owned by the National Trust.

The inquiry is the first major test for the Surrey and Sussex major crime team which was formally unveiled last month.
