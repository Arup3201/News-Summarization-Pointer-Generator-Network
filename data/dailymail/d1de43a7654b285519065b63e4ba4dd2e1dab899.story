Luis Suarez is on his way to Barcelona this summer, according to reports from Spanish newspapers.

'Mundo Deportivo' and 'Sport' have both lead with the headlines that the Liverpool star, fresh from breaking England hearts with Uruguay, is set to ditch his current club and head to the Catalan giants after the World Cup.

Sportsmail reported last week that Suarez is set to spark a £100million tussle between Barcelona and Real Madrid, but it now appears that the former are leading the battle for the superstar's signature.

'I want to leave Liverpool': Suarez's feelings according to Spanish paper 'Sport'

'Mundo' led with a front page of Suarez with the caption 'Sí al Barça', meaning 'Yes to Barca', whilst 'Sport' went with 'Me quiero ir del Liverpool', translating as 'I want to leave Liverpool'.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers spent the whole of last summer trying to keep his star striker away from the clutches of Premier League rivals Arsenal, and appears set for an even bigger battle on his hands this time out.

Suarez is currently more busy preparing himself for Uruguay's vital winner takes all game with Italy on Tuesday, with only the winner progressing from Group D to the last-16.
