An official photography firm for university graduation ceremonies is offering students the chance to airbrush their pictures to make them looker 'slimmer and healthier'.

Success Photography offers appearance-conscious graduates a celebrity-style digital makeover to reduce the effect of what is calls 'bulky and unflattering' academic gowns.

But students have hit out at the £9.95 service, branding it another form of 'fat-shaming'.

Students have criticised a photography company who offered them the chance to 'touch-up' their graduation photos to make them look 'healthier and slimmer'

The Surrey-based company's website gives students three options for manipulating their pictures; 'Complexion Touch-up' for £9.95, 'Digital Complexion and Smile Enhancement' for £7.95 and 'Digital Slimming' for £9.95.

The second option allows students to 'remove all imperfections such as blemishes, redness and shine, leaving skin looking smooth and healthy'.

The 'Digital Slimming' option reads: 'The traditional graduation gown is a mark of respect and achievement. However it can be bulky and unflattering.

'With advanced digital technology we can reduce the gown's appearance, making it more fitting to your shape.'

History and Politics student Sophie Gadd took to Twitter to complain about the company, who were covering her graduation ceremony at the University of York.

She said: 'I can pay £9.95 to have my graduation pictures photoshopped to make me look thinner :( Literally, what? You're wearing a giant billowing cloak.'

Another £9.95 option appeals to graduates concerned their academic gowns are 'bulky and unflattering'

Speaking to student newspaper The Tab, another graduate, who finished his degree at the same university, said: 'Surely this is a bad joke?

'They've squeezed us for every penny, with rising fees and rent, forcing many students such as myself to adopt an unhealthy lifestyle of cheap food because that's all we can afford.

'And on our final day they're asking for another tenner to remove the weight I've put on because I've not been able to afford fresh fruit and veg. It's sickening. This is just another example of fat-shaming.'

The  company describe themselves as the 'leading Graduation photography specialist' and are employed by several higher education institutions including St Andrews, York, Newcastle, Nottingham Trent, Imperial College London, Oxford Brookes, Exeter, Birmingham, Royal Holloway and Loughborough.

They have insisted the service is not meant to make people look thinner.

They tweeted: 'Just to make clear "digital slimming" refers to reducing the appearance of the gown only, never the individual.'

Students have mocked the service online, joking that any weight they have put on is due to their budget diet

A series of leaked photos have shown how the images of celebrities appearing in adverts and photoshoots have often been manipulated.

In 2004, actress Keira Knightley complained after her body was altered in a poster for hit film King Arthur.

She said 'those things certainly weren't mine' after photos showed the size of her bust had been digitally increased.

A photoshoot involving Jessica Alba was also digitally altered to give the model a thinner waistline

In 2008, leaked pictures showed model Jessica Alba's body had also been airbrushed during a fashion photoshoot.

The altered version of the picture showed her with a narrower chin and more make-up.

The touched-up picture also seemed to have removed some flesh from her already slim thighs and added some definition to her upper body.

In 2010, Britney Spears released pre-airbrushed images from a shoot she took part in for fashion firm Candie's.

Singer Britney Spears released un-edited photos of herself in 2010 to show the pressure women are under

The singer made the move in order to highlight the pressure exerted on women to look perfect.

So-called 'imperfections' that can be seen in the un-airbrushed shot, such as blemishes on her calf, are removed in the altered version. The size of her thighs and waist were also changed using computers.

Earlier this week, website Jezebel published before and after pictures of Mariah Carey from a photoshoot.

The singer's appearance (below) was clearly altered to make her appear slimmer and more tanned.
