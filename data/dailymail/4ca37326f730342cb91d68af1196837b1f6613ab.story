Tensions have escalated on Christmas Island where nine asylum seekers have reportedly stitched their mouths shut with dental floss and threatened to sew their eyes together in protest at conditions inside the detention centre run by the Australian government.

A substantial hunger strike is also underway, with 78 refugees refusing to eat this week.

There are fears that nine Iranian men who had sewn up their mouths may further harm themselves by stitching their eyes together in the coming days, according to The Australian newspaper.

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection's health contractor IHMS was closely monitoring the group, the paper reported.

Controversial: The government has been heavily criticicsed for secrecy about the treatment refugees who have tried to come to its shores

The group are among more than 2000 asylum-seekers – including hundreds of children – who have been held in indefinite detention inside the detention centre on Christmas Island, an Australian territory, some since last July.

The men were protesting at ‘living in limbo for six months’, according to the Refugee Rights Action Network.

The Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said: ‘This particular incident is under control, it's being managed by the service provider at this time’.

‘I get regular updates on what is happening there. It is a difficult environment when you've had people since July who have been at Christmas Island now for some time. That Christmas Island (detention) population now is down to around 2100. It is well below the capacity levels of Christmas Island. And the changes that have been made at Christmas Island since the riots took place some years ago have been significant.

‘There have been major upgrades to security infrastructure, and security procedures in those places to assist, manage and de-escalate events such as these.’

Mr Morrison said yesterday that the majority of asylum-seekers now held on Christmas Island would soon be sent to facilities on Nauru or Papua New Guinea's Manus Island where their asylum claims will be assessed.

Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young expressed concerns for the Christmas Island refugees and the ‘toxic culture breeding in these detention centres’.

‘It is distressing to hear vulnerable refugees being pushed to breaking point and sewing their lips together in sheer desperation after being locked up for too long and enduring the government's practice of separating families’ Senator Hanson-Young said yesterday.

‘I am especially concerned for the hundreds of children locked inside the camp. No child should bear witness to the horrors of long term detention and the desperation it causes.’

The protest news came as an asylum seeker was yesterday charged with making a bomb threat on a plane taking refugees from the Australian mainland to the Christmas Island detention centre.

It is alleged the 27-year-old Lebanese national threatened to blow up the chartered jet which was transporting him and other asylum seekers last Thursday. He has been charged by Australian Federal Police with making a false threat.
