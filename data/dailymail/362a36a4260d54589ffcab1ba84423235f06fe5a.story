A mother whose 21-month-old daughter was mauled to death in their backyard by the family's seven dogs is facing up to 10 years in prison after being charged with second-degree cruelty to children yesterday.

Summer Laminack, 18, was studying in her bedroom when her toddler, Monica Renee, slipped into their backyard, in the tiny town of Ellabell, near Savannah, and was attacked, her attorney said today.

"We feel and contend there is no question the death of this child was a tragic accident," attorney Tom Edenfield said by phone.

"My client is an 18-year-old mother who loved her daughter and cared for her very much."

Bryan County sheriff's investigators 
said the child slipped outside through a doggie door and was attacked by
the seven pit bulls and pit bull mixes.

By the time the girl's mother and other adults in the house noticed the dogs barking, the child was dead - on March 27.

Her clothing and diaper were found in shreds throughout the large fenced-in yard.

Edenfield said the toddler's mother was in her bedroom studying for her GED diploma when the attack happened.

The child's grandmother was taking a 
nap, Sheriff Clyde Smith has said. And at least one other adult was 
home, but authorities haven't said what that person was doing.

Four generations of the same family 
shared the home, including the child's mother, grandparents and two 
uncles who are still young boys, the sheriff said.

The family let the dogs come in and out of the house and never considered them a threat, Edenfield said.

"The baby had been around the dogs her entire life," he said.

Laminack was released from jail on 
bond. Georgia law defines second-degree child cruelty as an act of 
criminal negligence that causes a child excessive pain, either physical 
or mental.

It is a felony punishable by one to 10 years in prison.

District Attorney Tom Durden said he plans to let a grand jury decide if the case should go to trial.

"It was a very horrific event that 
happened," Durden said. "With what the facts are right now, it's 
something that should be presented to the grand jury for a decision."

Animal control officers euthanized 
all of the dogs. The sheriff said they appeared to be healthy and 
well-fed. Investigators have been unable to say what might have caused 
them to attack the toddler.

Though he called the girl's death an 
accident, Laminack's attorney stopped short of saying his client had 
committed no crimes. Edenfield said he's still looking into the details 
of the case.

He said Laminack's family has 
cooperated with authorities throughout their investigation. Meanwhile, 
the attorney said, the young mother is still grieving the death of her 
child.

"She is still, I think, suffering 
from the trauma of this event and will probably suffer for some time, if
not her entire life," Edenfield said.
