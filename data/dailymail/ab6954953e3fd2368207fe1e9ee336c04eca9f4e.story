Cousins and lovers murdered a man after he urinated on their bathroom floor and wrapped his body in cling wrap before burying him, a court has heard.

First cousins Jason Wiremu Hiroki and Aroha Hiroki are accused of killing 45-year-old Nick Katopodis after an evening of drinking at the couple's home in Wollongong on July 27, 2011.

'The crown case is that Jason and Aroha Hiroki were jointly responsible for the death of Nick Katopodis, that they were part of a joint criminal enterprise to commit an act that at least was intended to inflict grievous bodily harm,' crown prosecutor Tony McCarthy said in his opening address in the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

Mr Katopodis' body was found buried underneath the couple's home in early 2013.

The coroner was unable to determine a cause of death, but noted there were three small fractures on his skull, a broken bone in his left arm and that he had the plastic from a six pack of beer in his mouth.

The jury was told that after drinking with the couple and a friend during the day, Mr Katopodis went back to their house to continue partying.

Later, Jason found a heavily intoxicated Mr Katopodis urinating on the floor of the bathroom and punched him, knocking him out.

Mr Katopodis later went down to the couple's dining room. It was the last time he was seen alive.

The crown alleges Mr Katopodis' body was moved to a shed behind the house, wrapped in cling wrap and taken on a skateboard to be buried.

His body was found 19 months later and police found blood splatters on the wall and ceiling of the couple's dining room.

The couple told police different versions of their story and tried to blame each other, Mr McCarthy told the court.

It is also alleged Jason asked a friend about burying a body, telling him 'he wouldn't get off my missus'.

Jason's barrister, Janet Manuell SC, asked the jury to put to one side the couple's dysfunctional relationship, and said Aroha would try to paint Jason as abusive.

'We say she was not scared at all,' Ms Manuell said.

Aroha's barrister, Ragni Mathur, described Jason Hiroki as a man of violence and said Mr Katopodis died after being king-hit while in the bathroom.

Aroha told police Jason Hiroki killed Mr Katopodis with a beer bottle, before threatening her, the court heard.

Jason told police that when Mr Katopodis died he was asleep 'on the wacky tabaccy' and that Aroha said she hit Mr Katopodis after he 'came onto her'.

Jason has pleaded guilty to being an accessory to murder after the fact.

Both Jason and Aroha Hiroki have pleaded not guilty to murder.

The couple sat separately in court.

The trial continues.
