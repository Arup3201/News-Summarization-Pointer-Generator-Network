It might be one of London's smallest galleries but the Fan Museum in Greenwich does have a very good shop as the Duchess of Cornwall discovered today.

Camilla was making her fourth visit to the museum, which opened in 1991, when one of the pieces on sale in the attached boutique caught her eye.

Shopping, however, was not the reason for the Duchess' visit. Instead, she was there to inspect a new exhibition called Waterloo: Life and Times.

New fan: The Duchess of Cornwall toured the Fan Museum in Greenwich this morning

Launched to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, the new exhibition features fans and fan leaves made to commemorate the Iron Duke's victory over Napoleon.

Unsurprisingly, the Duke of Wellington himself features on many of the fans, most of which date from between 1800 and 1820, as does Nelson.

The Duchess, 67, was businesslike in a tailored pinstriped suit for the visit and looked particularly taken with a delicate Spanish fan that boasted an intricate lacy pattern cut from white damask.

Shown around by conservation expert Yuki Burt, Camilla stopped to inspect fans featuring the Duke of Wellington and Admiral Nelson, asking questions as she went.

Afterwards, the Duchess was shown into the Museum's Orangery, where she was shown the new mural decorating the back wall and had the secrets of re-ribboning a brisé [broken] fan explained.

Hidden gem: Camilla was on her fourth visit to the Museum, which contains more than 5,000 antique fans

Speaking about the museum, which the Duchess is believed to consider 'a hidden gem', curator Jacob Moss said: 'We have a very quirky reputation and we're an oasis of calm where people can step back into another world. 

'We have a really exciting programme of exhibitions this year which we hope offer something for everyone. 

'I would definitely encourage people to come and see us and stop off for afternoon tea in the Orangery.'

Her visit to the Fan Museum came after a morning spent visiting the  men and women being cared for at a community centre run by homelessness charity, Emmaus.

Camilla was shown around the centre by Craig Dunstan, himself a former rough sleeper who lived on the streets for nine months before being rescued by the charity.

Quirky: Curator Jacob Moss says the museum is 'quirky' but has something for everyone

The Duchess, who has been patron of Emmaus since 2006, stopped for a cup of tea with some of the people living in the shelter before officially opening a new accommodation block with space for 27 extra beds.

'This just shows what can be done when charities work together to produce something as good as this,' said Camilla as she unveiled a plaque to mark the opening.

'I've visited a lot of Emmaus communities and I'm very, very proud to be part of it because I think it's an incredible homeless charity which gives people hope and positivity and gives them back their dignity to get into the system again and go back to work.

'Emmaus communities are springing up all over the country and each one I visit has this wonderful, positive feel. I hope we can get more people looked after and housed in the future.'

People cared for by Emmaus are also given the chance to learn new skills, among them painting and decorating and basic plumbing, all of which are taught in a bid to help the formerly homeless get back into normal life.

Meanwhile... Down-to-earth Princess Anne mingles with the crowds at Thame Market

While the Duchess of Cornwall enjoyed a genteel visit to the Fan Museum in Greenwich, Princess Anne was in Oxfordshire to meet stallholders at Thame Market.

The market is celebrating its 800th birthday and the Princess Royal joined locals to mark the occasion, and also unveiled a plaque.

Thame's Tuesday market started life in 1183, although official recognition took another 20 years - eventually granted by King John in 1215.

Held on behalf of the townspeople by Bishop Hugh Troteman, the original charter allowed the town to hold a market once a been and a 'three to four day' fair once a year.

Renewed twice more, by Henry III in 1227 and Edward III in 1329, Thame's market charter is still in force today, although the cattle sales included in it have been moved to a different location away from the centre of town.
