They roared their team on in expectation of the win. The Emirates is rarely a placed for fiery passions but the home fans make an exception here for north London derbies.

And those Arsenal fans knew the victory should be theirs. Arsenal had largely dominated against their neighbours. They had by far the best of the attacking play. They had a sprinkling of delightful offensive options in Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla, a trio that would grace almost any team in the world.

Only Younes Kaboul and Hugo Lloris, giants in the Tottenham defence, stood between them and three points. Surely those points would come? Surely such an array of talent should be enough to overpower teams such as Spurs?

And yet it was not to be. Arsenal’s infamous brittleness had cost them again. Games they should win, they draw; games in which they ought to be competitive, they end up being comprehensively beaten. It is almost pointless to single out the individuals — last night it was Mathieu Flamini, losing the ball in front of his own penalty area — as almost all the team are serial offenders.

Spurs will be grateful for their draw. But until Arsene Wenger can address the vulnerabilities he has in shielding his defence — and he shows no sign of wishing to do so — there will be many more Groundhog Days like this.

There was much speculation as to whether Ozil would feature in his favoured central role — or be shunted out to the left. As it was, he started out wide, but swapped the position regularly with Jack Wilshere, the two of them undertaking the wide left duties as though it were an undesirable job-share.

And this derby felt a very Anglo-Saxon affair early on. Certainly the tackling was of a certain vintage. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wilshere received yellow cards, all too keen to make their impression — literally — on Tottenham, before Erik Lamela added his own Latin mark, cautioned for a late challenge on Kieran Gibbs.

And the football was of variable quality in that first half. What there was, was mainly created by Arsenal. Danny Welbeck was the first to inject some class into the game with a lovely flick past Jan Vertonghen and, leaving the Belgian in his wake, he was only denied by the assiduous covering run of Kaboul.

Welbeck shot unconvincingly at Lloris on 22 minutes but it wasn’t until 28 minutes that Arsenal conjured another clear chance. Aaron Ramsey raced down the right and released Welbeck, who touched the ball back to Wilshere, who in turn struck the ball ferociously from the edge of the box with Lloris well positioned to save.

Wilshere attacked Tottenham’s penalty area on 32 minutes, eventually falling under a challenge from Danny Rose and apparently twisting his ankle badly. Whether he was tripped or stumbled was a moot point, but referee Michael Oliver opted for the latter interpretation.

Yet Arsenal remain a delight for positive-minded opponents. If Tottenham had more confidence or incision in their attacking positions they would surely have made more of the wide spaces in around Arsenal’s defensive line. Time after time players mis-controlled, stumbled over the ball or lost possession. Typical of their first half was the opening for Emmanuel Adebayor on 38 minutes. Set up nicely by Lamela, he simply prodded the ball too far in front of him. Similarly, from a tight angle but with a clear sight of goal, Nacer Chadli pulled his shot lamely wide on 45 minutes.

Shortly before that Chadli chance, Arsenal created the best move of the match, Ramsey executing a lovely dummy before feeding Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose strike from outside the box tested Lloris to the full on 44 minutes. Sadly it was Ramsey’s last significant contribution, the Welshman limping off before half-time, joining Mikel Arteta, who had been withdrawn injured on 30 minutes.

Ryan Mason was doing his utmost on his Premier League debut, having impressed against Nottingham Forest in the Capital One Cup in midweek. But though he pressed forward, troubled Arsenal with driving runs on occasion, it was a big ask to pit against one of the finest midfields. Both he and Chadli were struggling to impose themselves.

And Arsenal started the second half with similar attacking intent to the first. Substitute Cazorla ghosted past his man and forced Kaboul to divert his cross-shot for a corner. Then Wilshere found Ozil, with the German forcing a good save from Lloris from 12 yards.

Yet Arsenal’s fragility when in possession is almost the defining feature of their football in the later Wenger years. So it would prove again. Flamini was caught by Christian Eriksen on the ball just outside his own area on 56 minutes.

The Dane found Lamela, who played in Chadli. With Szczesny to beat, the Belgian didn’t disappoint, pulling the ball confidently past the keeper before turning to celebrate directly with a cupped ear in front of the Arsenal fans in a glorious breach of the usual etiquette, which earned him a booking.

Arsenal, stirred, almost responded immediately, Per Mertesacker rising ever upwards to head a free-kick goalwards. For a moment it appeared he had scored before Lloris scrambled the ball away off the line.

Arsenal, though, had dominated the attacking play and it seemed unlikely they would be denied for 90 minutes. So it proved on 75 minutes, when Lamela scuffed a clearance, which fell to Alexis Sanchez. The Chilean dragged the ball back to Cazorla but his shot was deflected and the chance seemed to end in calamity, when Welbeck hit an embarrassing air shot just yards from goals. But amid the confusion caused, Oxlade-Chamberlain was following up and smashed the ball high into the net from six yards.
