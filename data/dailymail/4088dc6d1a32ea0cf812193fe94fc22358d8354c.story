Don Lemon is the latest CNN anchor to say ‘n*****’ during a live broadcast that went unbleeped, though he said the racial slur while discussing the ethics behind the decision of many journalists to refrain from saying the entire curse on air after deeming it too offensive.

Mr Lemon was specifically talking about when the curse was used in the context of a story, or when journalists are reading a quotation that uses the word.

During that discussion, Mr Lemon- who is African American- said that by refusing to say the word when used in the context of a story, journalists were effectively lessening its impact.

‘I think it takes the value out of what that word ready means, especially when we are reporting it,’ he said.

‘And I don't care what color the reporter is, I think someone should say, "That person calls someone n****," instead of saying the N-word, because I think it sanitizes it,’ he said, using the full word during the quotation.

Mr Lemon went on to clarify his distaste for the word, saying: ‘I hate it in music. I hate in those kinds of things. I hate one when it's misogynistic 's and rap and all that. But what I'm saying is in the reporting of a story, you should say the word not to sanitize it.’

The discussion was particularly poignant because another CNN reporter did just that the following day, leading to a backlash from viewers.

Susan Candiotti was reporting on the 
Good Friday shooting spree in Tulsa, in which a white man named Jake 
England randomly gunned down five black victims on the second 
anniversary of his father's death - he had been shot dead by an African 
American.

On Thursday, a day before the shootings, England took to his Facebook page to vent his anger about the man who shot him dead.

Apology: At the end of Ms Candiotti's report, anchor Fredricka Whitfield, left, said 'We apologize to our viewers for the profanities used'

When quoting England's Facebook page in her news report on Sunday for CNN Newsroom, Susan Candiotti repeated the profanity he used.

'Today is two years that my dad has been gone, shot by a f****** n*****.'

The network did blur the words out when it showed a graphic of the post.

Ms Candiotti had prefaced the comment by saying, 'Please excuse the language, it's very sensitive.'

At the end of Candiotti's report, anchor Fredricka Whitfield said, 'We apologize to our viewers for the profanities used.'

Criticism: Last month CNN reporter Drew Griffin said the n-word on live TV Thursday as he talked about a hate crime case

Ms Candiotti later apologized, as well saying, 'In quoting someone else’s words, I repeated their offensive and inappropriate language. I deeply regret it.'

Last month CNN reporter Drew Griffin said the n-word on live TV Thursday as he talked about a hate crime case.

Griffin was quoting the words used by Deryl Dedmon, a 19-year-old white Mississippi man convicted of hate crimes for running down black man with his truck and killing him.

Explaining the June killing of Craig Anderson, 47, Griffin says: 'Deryl Dedmond backs up and gets a good aim and just plows him over on the way out.

'To be absolutely factual, at the end of this, Deryl Dedmond is laughing with his friends and actually called on his cell phone and, pardon my language but there's no other way to say this, and said, "I just ran over that f*****g ******.'
