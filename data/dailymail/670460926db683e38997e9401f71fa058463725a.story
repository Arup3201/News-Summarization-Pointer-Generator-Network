Flights have been grounded, roads closed and power cuts have plunged vast areas of New Zealand into darkness following the country's heaviest snowfall in decades.

Snow and gale force winds have brought the country to a standstill during what forecasters are describing as a once-in-a-lifetime event.

Heavy snowfalls blanketed large parts of the city of Christchurch, New Zealand, this morning after the country was hit by a rare weather front from the Antarctic

The country's official weather station MetService recorded temperatures 
as low as minus four degrees Celsius (25 degrees Fahrenheit) in the 
resort of Queenstown.

Residents in the hillside suburbs of the capital city of Wellington were told they faced being snowed in after they were hit with the heaviest blanketing in at least 30 years.

Civil defence chief Rian Van Schalkwyk warned: 'People should prepare for the worst, which means making sure they're reading in the event that they cannot leave home and may be without electricity and other amenities.'

Mail delivery in many towns was disrupted, and many schools, libraries and swimming pools were closed.

Hundreds of passengers in Christchurch, Queenstown and Dunedin were stranded after flights were grounded and major highways became impassable on both islands.

One flight which did begin its journey from Palmerston North to Wellington was struck by lightning.

None of the 16 people on board were injured and the Air New Zealand plane landed without incident.

The New Zealand MetService has warned the polar blast will continue with further heavy snow expected over the next two days. From Taranaki, Taupo to Bay of Plenty and Gisborne northwards: Showers north of Waikato, some heavy with sleet and hail, but only a few showers further south. Snow down to 200 metres in the south and 400 metres in the north.Remainder of the North Island: Sleet and snow showers today, some heavy with hail, though mostly fine for Hawkes Bay. Showers clearing in the morning, but rain developing in the south tomorrow afternoon and spreading north at night. Gale southerlies in exposed places.Nelson and the West Coast: Fine, with frosts.Marlborough, Canterbury, Otago and Southland: Snow showers, heavy at times. Snow level slowly lifting tomorrow and showers easing in Southland and Otago later. Gale southerlies in coastal areas.The Chatham Islands: Showers, some heavy with hail, turning to rain for a period tomorrow followed by gale southerlies.

Four-wheel drive emergency vehicles and a snow plough were scrambled after more than 100 people were trapped in their cars on a road over the Rimutaka Hills, north of Wellington.

In Auckland, four people were taken to hospital after heavy winds caused a tree to crash into their home.

WeatherWatch service forecaster Philip Duncan told the New Zealand Herald: 'I've been watching the weather closely for about 15 years and I've never seen a prediction like this.'

He said the freezing conditions were due to a large high-pressure system reaching from Antarctica to the sub-tropics, which had merged with three neighbouring low-pressure systems.

Although Auckland had its heaviest snowfall since the 1970s, much of it was washed away by heavy rain.

Mr Duncan added: 'Aucklanders won't have white-out conditions like Wellington, Christchurch or Dunedin but certainly a few isolated pockets of snow are likely mixed with the rain.

MetService forecaster Peter Kreft told NZPA the freezing conditions were 'a once in many decades event' and suggested the country had not experienced anything like it for half a century.

He said: 'We are probably looking at something like - in terms of extent and severity - maybe 50 years.'

Meanwhile, Stephen Fry, who is in Wellington filming The Hobbit, described the atmosphere on Twitter.

He Tweeted: 'It's been an exciting day here in Wellington. Snow. That's unusual. NZ is the same latitude as Melbourne so it's rare.' 

Prime Minister John Key opened a press conference yesterday by welcoming reporters to the 'winter wonderland that is Wellington'.

He said: 'I can't personally recall seeing snow in downtown Wellington. My wife tells me there is snow around our house, or at least there was for a short period of time in Auckland, so it's very unusual'

Residents whose homes were damaged by the Christchurch earthquake have been warned to take extra care and check for leaks and movement and consider evacuation.
