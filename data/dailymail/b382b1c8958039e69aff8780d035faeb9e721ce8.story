Following Bayern Munich's impressive display in Wednesday night's 7-0 win over Shakhtar, Pep Guardiola praised his 'fantastic' players as they eased into the Champions League quarter-finals.

The Ukrainian side had Olexandr Kucher sent off after just three minutes - the quickest in the tournament's history - but the Spaniard's side remained professional throughout and the statistics make for impressive reading.

After a tight 0-0 in the first leg, Guardiola was pleased with Bayern's performance and their ability to see the tie through.

'We are very pleased,' he admitted. 'We deserved the win. The players did fantastically.

'Of course it is a little easier against 10 men. But from the beginning we could see that the team was alert. Congratulations to the team, we dominated the game.'

The scoreline was far from flattering for the German champions and it could have been more with the 25 shots they mustered up over 90 minutes.

Thomas Muller got a double, including a penalty following the red card. Jerome Boateng, Franck Ribery, Holger Badstuber, Robert Lewandowski and Mario Gotze also found the net - showing that Guardiola's side can score goals from all over the pitch.

Incredibly, Arjen Robben was the outfield only player who started to not score or get an assist during the demolition of the Ukrainian side - and he was taken off injured after 19 minutes.

This was the second time the Germans struck seven past the opposition in the Champions League following their stunning 7-1 win over Roma back in October.
