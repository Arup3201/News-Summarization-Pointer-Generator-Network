The first same-sex weddings in England and Wales will take place from March 29, 2014 - months earlier than had been expected.

When the highly-contentious same-sex marriage Bill cleared the Commons in July, couples hoping to tie the knot were told they would have to wait until next summer.

But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said next March would be a ‘real moment for celebration’ when the first weddings are held.

First: Same-sex weddings will be able to take place in England and Wales from March 29 next year

Couples wishing to be among the first to marry will need formally to give notice of their intention to marry on March 13.

Mr Clegg said: ‘This is the news many couples have been waiting for. After a long and important battle, this is a wonderful step forward for equality.

‘Love is the same, gay or straight, so it’s only right that the civil institution should be the same.

‘Next March will be a real moment for celebration as same sex couples finally get the chance to express their love through marriage.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'Love is the same, gay or straight'

More than 130 Tory MPs voted against the bill but was passed with the support of the Lib Dems and Labour.

David Cameron has admitted gay marriage has been deeply unpopular within Tory ranks, but insisted it was the right thing to do.

When the controversial legislation became law, he spoke of his pride that gay boys at school worried about being bullied would see Parliament declaring that ‘their love is the same as everyone else’s love’.

Tory Culture Secretary Maria Miller said: ‘Marriage is one of our most important institutions, and from March 29, 2014 it will be open to everyone, irrespective of whether they fall in love with someone of the same sex or opposite sex.

‘This is just another step in the evolution of marriage and I know that many couples up and down the country will be hugely excited that they can now plan for their big day and demonstrate their love and commitment to each other by getting married.’

Ms Miller said she was ‘working hard’ to ensure that couples wishing to convert civil partnerships into marriages - and married people wanting to change their legal gender while remaining married - will be able to do so before the end of next year.

Same-sex couples who married abroad under foreign law and are currently treated as civil partners will be recognised as being married in England and Wales from March 2014.

Those wishing to take part in same-sex weddings in some British consulates and armed forces bases overseas or in military chapels will have to wait until June.

Bob Woollard, chairman of the 
organisation Conservative Grassroots, said the timing of the first gay 
marriages was a gift to the UK Independence Party, which claims to have 
attracted large numbers of Tory activists in the wake of the gay 
marriage row.

Mr Woollard 
said: ‘Once again we have a tiny metropolitan elite at the top of the 
party rushing things through without adequate consultation with ordinary
members.

'They don’t listen and they seem to go out of their way to upset people unnecessarily.’

Gay couples had been told the first weddings could not happen until next summer, but the date has been brought forward

Ben Summerskill, chief executive of gay rights campaign group Stonewall, said he was ‘delighted’ at the announcement, which he said was ‘particularly resonant’ as it came on United Nations Human Rights Day.

‘This historic step will mean that, for the first time, every gay person in England and Wales will finally enjoy exactly the same rights as their heterosexual friends and family,’ said Mr Summerskill.

In a message to same-sex couples making preparations to walk down the aisle together, he added: ‘Don't forget, if you are thinking of booking a date for your big day in the new year, it's now against the law for any business to treat someone less fairly because of their sexual orientation - whether they're a register office, a hotel or a florist.

Scotland is in the process of legislating to allow same sex weddings.
