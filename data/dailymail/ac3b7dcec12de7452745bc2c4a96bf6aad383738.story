Those for whom standard clubbing has become so passé, or for anyone looking to combine their artistic talents with alcohol and a touch of voyeurism, there is a new trend about to hit the UK.

Coming from the US, Nude Body Painting involves a club night where you turn up, strip down, and proceed to both dance, drink and paint each other’s naked bodies with UV paint.

While the more body conscious, or simply those who shudder at the thought of twerking naked, will be relieved to hear that getting down to the buff is not mandatory, Nude Body Painting is definitely not a night for wall flowers.

The concept of the Naked Painting Parties is simple- strip off as much as you like and grab a paint brush

Nude Body Painting, the first of which is to be held later this month, is definitely not a night for wall flowers

The energy at the painting parties is best described as The Full Moon Parties in Thailand meets Art Basel

The first UK party, which is to be held in London on May 25th, is set to feature feature electric, bizarre colours and décor, deep house and circus performers as well as the 300 naked revellers.

A concept devised by Social Exposure, a New York City-based avant-garde events company, the events have been a massive success state-side and across the world, drawing hundreds of eager thrill seekers in New York, Mexico and Miami.

As well as a chance to bare it all and network outside the box the idea of the nights is to 'celebrate inner beauty, positive body image and unity through the arts', with the energy at the painting parties can be best described as The Full Moon Parties in Thailand meets Art Basel.

‘When I first heard about this concept coming to London, I just HAD to make it happen at Trapeze Bar!" Says Sarah Holgate, director of Events and Promotions at Trapeze, the club where the first Naked Painting is to be held.

‘Shoreditch is quickly becoming the best area for new, exciting and refreshing nightlife and The Naked Painting Party is certainly all encompassing.

‘It is one of the ONLY events in the world that is so hugely interactive and collaborative. People don’t sit around and watch someone paint, the point is to paint each other.

‘Brushes are going every where and you should expect to leave completely covered in paint,' explains founder of Social Exposure, Sally Golan.

The rules for the eccentric evening are things such as ‘No inappropriate behaviour’ and ‘respect each others privacy and bodies’.

The premiere of the Nude Body Painting marks a growing trend in strange and Avant guard parties and themed club nights in the UK as people grow increasingly bored with the traditional drink-and-dance formula.

Pheromone parties – where guests smell each other’s well-worn clothing to judge their compatibility based on attraction to someone’s natural musk- are increasing common around the UK, as are mainstream sex-clubs like Candy Kittens, where guests can go clubbing in an upmarket venue while engaging with as much, or as little sexual activity as they like.
