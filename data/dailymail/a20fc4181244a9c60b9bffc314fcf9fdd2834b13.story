Robert Wills was today awarded £30,000 pounds by an employment tribunal while still in prison serving time for the possession of child porn images

A convicted paedophile serving time in prison has been awarded more than £30,000 after suing his former employers from his prison cell.

Robert Wills took RWE Npower to a tribunal after they refused to pay him a redundancy settlement after reading about his sentence for child pornography in the local paper.

The former power station worker was being made redundant following the closure of a plant in Didcot, Oxfordshire, when he admitted making indecent images of children.

After reading of his sentence his employers suspended his holiday pay and cancelled a redundancy package, arguing he had 'frustrated' his contract by not being available to work.

However, Ian Van Maanen, from the Citizens' Advice Bureau, successfully 
argued that as Wills was on agreed leave at the time and was not 
expected back at work before his job came to an end, he was not in 
breach of his contract.

He also said that Wills had no moral or legal duty to tell his employers of the criminal case because it did not involve them.

In February Wills was sentenced to two years behind bars after admitting 10 charges, including making indecent images, intentionally encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence and distributing indecent photos.

Employment Judge Andrew Gumbiti-Zimuto 
said: 'In this case it is said on the behalf of the claimant that the 
contract is not frustrated by his imprisonment because there was no 
requirement for the claimant to be at work.

'He was on leave. Whether the claimant 
was in Bullingdon (Prison) or in Benidorm, it made no difference to the 
contract of employment.'

Wills was being made redundant from Didcot Power Station when he admitted the offences causing RWE Npower to cancel his payments because he had 'frustrated' his contract by not being available to work

He said RWE Npower had cancelled the payment as Wills was not available to work while he was in prison.

However, the judge told the tribunal parties: 'My conclusion is that the contract was not frustrated. Imprisonment does not automatically end the employment.

'In this case the claimant was not expected to enter work, whether in prison or out, before the contract of employment expired.

'The claimant's imprisonment has not made any contractual obligation incapable of being performed - he was not required to work.'

In his judgement, Mr Gumbiti-Zimuto said he was awarding Wills £5,850 in statutory redundancy, £24,953 for breach of contract and £1,731 in holiday pay.
