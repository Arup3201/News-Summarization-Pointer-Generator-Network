Criminals who blight the Olympics will face swift justice under plans to get them in the dock within hours.

Prosecutors want to repeat the success of the judicial blitz that followed the August riots last year.

Yobs, thieves and fraudsters will find themselves in court within 24 hours as courts extend their hours.

Virtual ‘live link’ hearings, in which suspects can appear via a camera in police stations, will fast-track people through the system.

The special measures will apply to those accused of ‘Olympics offences’, defined by who they and the victim are and when and where they occur.

They will also apply to foreign nationals and could see those convicted handed exclusion orders banning them from Games venues.

The unprecedented contingency plans have been drawn up by the Crown Prosecution Service and will cover London, the Thames Valley and Weymouth in Dorset.

They will delight ministers who desperately want to speed up the everyday course of justice.

But it remains to be seen whether they will be necessary, as some previous major sporting events have led to a drop in crime.

Alison Saunders, London’s chief Crown prosecutor, said lawyers will be on call 24 hours a day to assist police.

She added: ‘Many people who come to the Olympics won’t live here, so it is important that if offences are committed, we act quickly.

‘People who commit offences on Tuesday will be in court on Wednesday ... we are learning the lessons of the summer riots.’

The riots piled pressure on the courts, forcing them to open around the clock to cope with a flood of defendants.

Politicians and police were delighted as some cases were completed within hours and heavy sentences handed down, discouraging further crimes.

Courts are prepared to open from 8am to 7.30pm, effectively doubling their normal hours. Some courts will also sit on Saturdays, something that already takes place in many areas to deal with Friday night crimes.

Virtual courts, in which video conferencing technology is employed, will also cut the number of prison van journeys around the congested capital.

Prosecutors expect crimes to include ticket touting, low-level street disorder, pick-pocketing and muggings.

Mrs Saunders said it was impossible to predict whether crime rates will rise or fall during the Olympics.

She added: ‘There is no direct comparison. At the Manchester Commonwealth Games, offending levels actually fell, perhaps because people were preoccupied and also because there was a feel-good factor.

Offenders who commit crimes during the Olympics may face tough penalties as magistrates take a dim view of the damage to Britain’s reputation.

Police fear protest groups may seek to hijack events to broadcast their views to the billions watching on TV worldwide.

Organised crime gangs are already reported to be transporting coach loads of Eastern European migrants to work as pickpockets, beggars or prostitutes.

Of 138 courts across 11 Crown Court complexes, just over half will be sitting during the 17 days of the Olympic Games.

Many will close because of problems of traffic and access and some have listed fewer cases because of the disruption.
