Ayoze Perez has revealed that he snubbed Real Madrid and Barcelona to sign for Newcastle.

The Spain Under-21 striker announced his arrival on the Premier League stage with United’s winner at Spurs on Sunday, climbing to head home a Remy Cabella cross. 

The effort - which sealed a 2-1 victory - was his first goal since signing for the Magpies in a £1.5million deal from Tenerife in June and came on his full league debut.

Newcastle, however, had to beat off competition from a host of Spanish clubs to land the pacey frontman, who scored 16 times in the Segunda Division last season and was nominated for the best ‘breakthrough player’ award.

But only now has the 21-year-old confirmed that Real and Barca were among those chasing his signature.

‘Yes, there was interest from Barcelona and Real Madrid,’ he said.

‘The truth is that the Newcastle bid was quite surprising because firstly there were other teams interested. 

‘But they pushed very hard to get me. I feel they really valued me.’

Sportsmail understands that the offer to join the Spanish giants involved Perez spending an initial period in the second tier with their ‘B’ teams.

But it was the prospect of getting his chance in the Premier League - and Newcastle’s eagerness to get the deal done - which persuaded him that his future lay in the North East of England, where his brother, Samuel, has also signed for non-league Blyth Spartans.

‘We had to consider the different options and I finally decided to come to Newcastle,’ he said.

‘I have always loved the Premier League but the main reason to come here was how Newcastle valued myself.

‘I felt very appreciated by the club and that was the reason which made me opt to come here.’
