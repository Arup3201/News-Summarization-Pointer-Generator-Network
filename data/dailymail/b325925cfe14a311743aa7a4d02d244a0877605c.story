Brendan Rodgers has admitted Liverpool’s play has been left ‘a little broken’ by the significant overhaul of their squad this summer.

The Liverpool manager, who believes victory in Saturday’s Merseyside derby will belatedly launch a season that has failed to get started, made nine new signings during the last transfer window, as well as selling Luis Suarez to Barcelona.

Such a significant transition in personnel has seen Liverpool lose three of their first five  Premier League matches, with their performances being characterised by poor defending, and Rodgers is aware of how standards have dropped from last season’s dazzling brand.

Mario Balotelli has been brought in to replace the Uruguayan but will need time to fully settle in 

That is why he believes Liverpool need to get back to the basics that served them so well last term and he has been encouraged by the squad’s willingness to learn from their mistakes.

‘I think at this moment in time we are re-focusing and reintroducing principles into our game that has brought the win ratio we’ve had in the last 18 months,’ said Rodgers. 

‘Apart from the Tottenham game (won 3-0) we have moved away a bit from that.

‘Our game is based on fast pressing, a real high intensity and also the speed of our football. We put a lot of hard work in during the first six months that we were here and a lot of those processes became natural — the consequence of that is winning.

Liverpool have lost three of their five Premier Lague matches and sit in a lowly 11th position

‘When you introduce a raft of new players and lose the core of players, that’s obviously a factor and then it becomes a little bit broken. That’s how our game has looked for me for a big part of the season. Where I am fortunate is that I have a group of players here that identify with that.

‘We are all in this together and we need to get back to re-focus on what has allowed us to win games consistently over the last 18 months to two years. That has been about the way we play and imposing our style and strength on our opponents.’

Beating Everton, though, would provide a significant boost ahead of next Tuesday’s Champions League trip to Basle and Rodgers recognises it could dramatically alter the perception of his new arrivals if one were to score a winning goal.

‘Derby games give you a chance to be a hero and the players here are well aware of that,’ said Rodgers. 

‘It’s a massive game to the supporters, a very special game. But it’s also for me about getting back to performing well. It’s important we get a victory and that will give us confidence.’

If Rodgers has issues to contend with so does Everton manager Roberto Martinez.

He accepts his side’s defending has not been good enough, while he also feels Everton need to clear a mental barrier tomorrow, as it has been 15 years since they last won at Anfield.

The Reds have been missing the injured Daniel Sturridge, but he could return against the Toffees

Martinez said: ‘I think the psychology is a very important point because if you look at the stats, 15 years without a win at Anfield, then it needs to be a bit more than football. It can’t always be a football reason why you haven’t won a game over that period.

‘So I’ll accept that . . . we are ready to go anywhere. I’m not highlighting Anfield as a place we don’t look forward to. I think the mentality of the group is to go anywhere and focus on our performance.

‘Will it be a difficult game? Of course. They are in a position where they need to perform well at home and get points, but I don’t see that psychologically we are not ready to go to Anfield and be ourselves, that is the answer to the question.’
