A motorbike rider who was arrested for dangerous driving after posting a video of himself narrowly missing a car before tumbling down a cliff online has been banned from the roads.

The video shows Jack Sanderson, 21, overtaking two other motorcyclists on a narrow road before coming off on a bend, speeding in front of a car, hitting a wall, and plunging 40ft down a cliff.

The footage was viewed 1.2million times on YouTube, but after it was sent to police, Sanderson, from Knutsford, Cheshire, was arrested and has now been banned from driving for two years.

Jack Sanderson, 21, who posted footage of himself crashing his motorbike into a wall before tumbling 40ft down a cliff online has been banned from driving for two years

In the video, which got more than 1.2million hits on YouTube, Sanderson loses control on a bend, narrowly avoids hitting a car, flips over a wall and falls down a cliff but escapes uninjured

He was also given a 12 week jail term suspended for 12 months, ordered to complete 300 hours unpaid work and told to pay a total of £1983.80, including compensation for damaging the wall.

Officers traced the owner of the Honda Accord, seen swerving to avoid Sanderson in the video, who told Macclesfield Magistrates Court that he now suffers flashbacks from the incident.

Passing sentence, JP Julia Cawson told him: 'The manner of your driving on a notorious road can only be described as both dangerous and breathtakingly thoughtless. 

'It was a matter of seconds that was the difference between what occurred and a potential fatality.

'During the trial you showed little acceptance that the manner of your riding was in any way unacceptable. We are glad that you are now able to admit culpability.'

Earlier prosecutor Miss Kate Marchuk said: 'Police first became aware when Mr Sanderson went to Macclesfield District Hospital where staff made note to the police that the defendant was bragging about being involved in a road traffic accident.

Police were alerted to the footage and managed to trace both Sanderson and Mr Shapiro, the driver of the car in the clip, who said he suffers flashbacks from the accident

Sanderson was also given a 12 week jail term suspended for 12 months, ordered to complete 300 hours unpaid work and told to pay a total of £1983.80

'Two anonymous calls were also made to the police saying he had posted footage showing him riding a bike on the Cat and Fiddle Road where he had a near miss with a car. The footage was described by the caller as dangerous.

'The footage was viewed via YouTube. He was riding his motorbike along the A537 Buxton New Road from Macclesfield toward the Cat and Fiddle. 

'The footage does show Mr Sanderson overtaking on two occasions into the bend into the passage of cars on the other carriage way. 

'He is then seen to crash through a wood fence and dry stone wall and seen falling 40ft.

'From that YouTube footage the police were able to locate the Honda Accord of a Mr Shapiro and his wife. Mr Shapiro was spoken to and said he was to travelling with his wife who was a front seat passenger and was confronted with a motorbike travelling too fast, trying to negotiate a tight bend. 

'Me Shapiro then stopped as soon as he could and ended up in the opposite side of the road. He walked back to where the collision happened and by that point Mr Sanderson had already got back on the road.

'Mr Shapiro suffers flashbacks of motorbike approaching him.'

Sanderson later told police he was an experienced rider and said he was very competent and had ridden that road previously, but admitted he had never read the Highway Code.

Sanderson claimed that he had posted the footage to inform people of the dangers of driving on country roads, but medics at the hospital he was taken to afterwards recalled him bragging about the crash

In mitigation John Richards said: 'The young man is extremely frightened at the prospect of him going into custody. He did say "if I go I do deserve it."

'Sometimes the arrogance of youth goes with age and sometimes something like his knocks it out of you. He is very lucky not to have been killed or anyone else.'

'He stuck it on Facebook and it ended up on YouTube. He said at the time he put it up as public service to stop people making the same mistake as he did.' 

The A537 Cat and Fiddle Road between Macclesfield, Cheshire, and Buxton, Derbyshire, has been repeatedly been branded Britain’s most dangerous due its severe bends and steep drops.
