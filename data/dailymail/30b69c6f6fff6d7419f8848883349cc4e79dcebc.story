Simon Mignolet once again cost his side a goal as Liverpool laboured to a win over Ludogorets Razgrad on their Champions League return on Tuesday night. So is it time to trade in the Belgian for a better keeper? We asked Henry Jackson of authoritative Liverpool fansite This Is Anfield to assess whether Mignolet is worthy of the No 1 shirt. 

When Simon Mignolet joined Liverpool for £9m from Sunderland in the summer of 2013, he was seen as an excellent long-term signing by the club. It's not quite working out like that at the moment, however.

The Belgium international is yet to convince during his short time at Anfield, and there is a definite argument that he is a major weak-link in Brendan Rodgers' exciting side.

Tuesday night's last-gasp Champions League victory over Ludogorets saw Mignolet largely at fault for the visitor's late equaliser, which looked to have cost the hosts two points.

The 26-year-old charged out of his goal with Dani Abalo clean-through in stoppage time, making it far too easy for the substitute to round him and slot the ball into an empty net. To put it bluntly, it was very poor goalkeeping.

While there can be no doubting Mignolet's shot-stopping ability - Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher is one who passionately argues that all top level goalkeepers should be very good at stopping shots, as it's their job - there is a nervousness about him with the ball at his feet, he lacks dominance aerially and he has the knack of costing his side at big moments.

If you look at last season, mistakes by Mignolet ultimately cost Liverpool dearly in their quest for a maiden Premier League title.

Mignolet makes a feeble effort to keep out Alvaro Negredo's shot as Liverpool lost to Man City last season

His woeful attempt to keep out Alvaro Negredo's shot in the 2-1 loss to eventual champions Manchester City at the Etihad on Boxing Day was critical, while a few days later he softly let Samuel Eto'o's tame effort past him as they succumbed to defeat at Chelsea.

Although it's both impossible and harsh to blame the Belgian for Rodgers' side not winning the title - they could quite easily not have won the 11 straight games that got them right into the mix - he certainly didn't help matters.

Although Liverpool's defence is deservedly taking plenty of criticism at the moment, in particular the likes of Dejan Lovren and Mamadou Sakho at centre-back, a large part of that is because they look like they lack faith in Mignolet. There doesn't appear to be much communication there, and it is proving an issue.

Liverpool have been linked with former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes 

Consistent trophy-winning sides almost always have a top-class goalkeeper in their ranks, and at the moment Mignolet does not fall into that category. There are many better than him in the Premier League.

The club have been strongly linked with a move for former Barcelona star Victor Valdes over the last few weeks, with the Spain international currently a free agent. 

The 32-year-old would be the perfect acquisition, and is both a world-class keeper and a born winner. His quality on the ball - something Rodgers is keen for in his goalkeepers - experience and consistency would make a huge difference.

Mignolet is far from a bad goalkeeper, but he is not at the level required if Liverpool want to win silverware on a consistent basis. He will cost the Reds crucial points between now and the end of the season if he remains first-choice.
