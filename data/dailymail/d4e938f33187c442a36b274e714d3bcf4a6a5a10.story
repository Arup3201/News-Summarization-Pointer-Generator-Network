With a repertoire to rival the most outlandish Saudi and Russian mega-yachts, the Nirvana is causing a bidding war among billionaire sailors as they battle to snap up the £200 million sea city.

Only a handful of yachts have been priced more than the one-year-old vessel - making it one of the most luxurious floating mansions on the planet.

And with Monaco's millionaire playground calling, a frenzied auction is on-going between global moguls each wanting to set sail on the six-deck juggernaut.

Incredible: The mighty Nirvana is causing a bidding war among billionaire sailors as they battle to snap up the £200 million sea city

Bidding war: A frenzied auction is on-going between global moguls each wanting to set sail on the six-deck yacht

Built by South African construction gurus Oceanco and designed by Australian Sam Sorgiovanni, the 88.5 metre-long yacht has a remarkable pedigree history.

Although the bespoke craftsmanship has attracted a huge amount of interest from willing buyers, none have mustered up the cash.

A spokesman for Edmiston, who are marketing the yacht, said: 'Nirvana is without question one of a handful of elite world cruising yachts around today - and it is certainly the most impressive and opulent yacht currently on sale.

'Every inch of the ship has been painstakingly designed and built. There really is little else like it.

Yacht: The incredible top deck provides beautiful views and is the perfect place to relax

Pool area: Arriving from the swim platform, guests arrive onto a vast aft deck complete with 7.5m luxury pool and a large sunbed area

Prestige: All guests cabins are situated on the main deck, with floor to ceiling windows and as well as the full beam VIP stateroom

'There, of course, has been a lot of interest in the listing but as of yet no sale has been agreed.'

Arriving from the swim platform, guests arrive onto a vast aft deck complete with 7.5m luxury pool and a large sunbed area. 

The floor of the pool rises to create a huge deck for entertaining family and friends or just to show off the business compatriots - forward in the main salon is a bar and exotic reptile house separating it from the dining area. 

All guests cabins are situated on the main deck, with floor to ceiling windows and as well as the full beam VIP stateroom.

Mood lighting: The luxurious facilities are perfect for treating friends and family to a trip

Technology: The mega-yacht even features a 3D cinema, perfect for keeping the kids entertained

Privacy: The silver engraved elevator services all decks and leads guests up to the owner's deck which can be transformed into a secluded on-board retreat

Plush: When everything just gets too hard, the owner can retire to one of the many comfortable bedrooms available

The silver engraved elevator services all decks and leads guests up to the owner's deck which can be transformed into a secluded on-board retreat. 

The owner's stateroom dominates over half of the upper deck, with a private sunbathing area with Jacuzzi forward, salon with terraces over the sea and a covered dining area. Exterior stairs on the above deck lead to the bridge deck and the enormous and superbly equipped gymnasium and spa.

But when spas and five-star dining becomes too much, there is a private sundeck with plunge pool to enjoy, a 3D cinema next to twins garages that caters for supercars, ski boats or 10 jet skis.

Or if riding waves is too similar to sailing, then owners will be able to fly off in their own helicopter from their private helipad.
