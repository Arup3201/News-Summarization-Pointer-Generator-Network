Deborah Dendle who almost died from Sepsis (Septicaemia) following on from an operation

Deborah Dendle was expecting to feel a bit sore after her operation to remove scar tissue left by Caesareans and other treatment. But the mother-of-two quickly became very ill and nearly lost her life after developing sepsis, a dangerous response to infection.

While it typically occurs following pneumonia, and urinary or severe skin infections, many cases are linked to post-operative infections.

Deborah, 37, had scarring on her stomach following radiotherapy for Hodgkins lymphoma (cancer of a type of white blood cell) as a teenager and two subsequent Caesarean births.

She had the 12-hour operation to remove the scar tissue, which was causing her pain, in September 2009.

'It went well, I was kept in for two days as planned, and sent home on the third,' says the former chef, from Greenford, Middlesex.

'I had anticipated the pain afterwards, which was moderate, but I didn't feel quite myself. I felt fluey, ached all over, and had a high temperature, but put it down to the after-effects of the op.

'On my second day home, I felt lethargic and wanted to sleep constantly. But I've had so much poor health - cancer, meningitis and pneumonia - that I didn't want to worry my loved ones. So I kept quiet and thought it was probably a normal reaction to major surgery.'

But, by day three, Deborah's breathing had become erratic, she was totally exhausted and couldn't eat. 'I knew then something wasn't right. I tried to stand, but I collapsed, and I felt like I was suffocating,' she says.

Deeply concerned, her family rang for an ambulance. But Deborah's partner Andrew ended up driving her to Charing Cross Hospital in London himself - although not their nearest hospital, it was where she'd had her operation.

'By the time we arrived, I couldn't stand and was struggling to stay awake,' says Deborah. 'Something was drastically wrong.'

It was only because Andrew 'threw a tantrum' at A&E that doctors agreed to see her quickly, she says. 'He was very agitated, and more or less demanded that a doctor examine me - so I was seen within five minutes.'

And it was this early intervention - rather than the four-hour waiting time she might have otherwise endured - that Deborah believes saved her life.

'I had a team of six or seven medics 
around me, and one of them had dealt with a sepsis case before, so he 
recognised my symptoms immediately, thank God,' she says.

'He
 spotted my shallow breathing, flu-like symptoms and fatigue - all 
tell-tale signs of sepsis - as well as the fact I hadn't been to the loo
 for ten hours.'

Breathlessness occurs as the body fights to increase oxygen flow to the brain, and sepsis patients struggle to pass urine as the condition affects their kidney function.

Deborah was diagnosed with severe sepsis and taken to intensive care because her organs had begun shutting down.

'I was barely conscious and I felt like I was dying. My mum contacted my dad and got my brother to return from France, where he was working - no one thought I was coming home.'

Sepsis occurs when the immune system over-reacts to a fungal, viral or bacterial infection, attacking the heart and other organs. It can cause fever, inflammation, low blood pressure, blood clotting problems and multiple organ failure. The most common causes are pneumonia, bowel perforation (when a hole opens up in the bowel, letting its contents into the abdomen), urinary infection and severe skin infections.

However, an estimated 10 per cent of all cases are the result of post-operative infections, with bowel surgery carrying the highest risk because of the large number of bacteria in the area.

It usually takes 48 to 72 hours for sepsis to develop  - genetic factors can affect the timing - but it can actually start developing several days after surgery.

Around 37,000 people die from sepsis every year - more than from bowel and breast cancer (two of the most common causes of cancer deaths) combined.

However, an estimated 13,000 of these deaths are preventable, according to a report last year from the Health Service Ombudsman, which blamed delayed diagnosis and treatment, failure to recognise the severity of the illness and poor procedures, for the deaths.

Campaigners, including the charity UK Sepsis Trust, are calling for greater awareness of symptoms and for medics to be better trained to diagnose the condition.

The charity was founded by Dr Ron Daniels, an intensive care doctor at the Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, following the death of a 37-year-old patient who developed sepsis in 2006 after a vasectomy. The patient's condition was missed by two GPs before he ended up being rushed to hospital. Within 48 hours he was dead.

'Part of the reason for the low awareness is that sepsis was only recognised relatively recently,' explains Dr Daniels.

'Tissue decay and bacterial infection have always existed, but sepsis is very complex and was only officially defined in 1991, following a consensus among international experts.' (It was formerly known as septicaemia, but this term tends to be associated with a bacterial infection of the blood through cuts or injury, which misrepresents the wide range of causes of sepsis.)

Slurred speech, triggered by lack of blood supply to  the brain

Mottled or discoloured skin

Extremely painful muscles, due to lack of oxygen

Passing no urine (in one  day) as the kidneys stop working properly

Severe breathlessness - the body senses there isn't enough oxygen 
getting to the brain, so it increases the 'drive' to breathe to increase
 it

Chronic tiredness and swelling of the affected area

Another problem is that sepsis can affect all specialisms in medicine. As Dr Daniels says: 'Whereas heart attacks are “owned” by cardiologists, strokes by stroke specialists, and so on, there are no specific sepsis specialists fighting for money to combat it.' This makes funding harder to attract. Furthermore, it is difficult to diagnose, as there is no single tool for spotting it.

'All we have currently is a blood test that can help identify high levels of lactate, a chemical which can indicate organ failure and the approach of septic shock,' says  Dr Daniels.

He adds: 'This is the most severe end of sepsis, when organs begin to fail and blood pressure falls. We welcome the report from the ombudsman because it highlights the human cost of the low awareness.'

The good news is that researchers at Guy's Hospital in London recently discovered a group of biomarkers in the blood that signal the presence of sepsis, so a test may be available within as little as two years.

As for Deborah, doctors located the main site of the sepsis on the right-hand side of her body, where a large amount of septic pus had collected. It's thought the infection had spread there, via the bloodstream, from the surgical incision.

Three drains were inserted to remove the pus, and Deborah was given strong antibiotics and put on life support.

'I was induced into a coma for nearly a day while the fluid was draining so I could rest, mentally and physically, from the trauma, as I could not breathe properly for myself. When I came round I felt better,' she says.

Now, three years on, she still has nerve damage in her back from where the pus had been removed via a tennis ball-sized drain hole. This damage means she sometimes suffers severe pain, as well as  frequent numbness from her shoulder to her knee.

'I'm not complaining though - I'd have died otherwise,' she says. 'I'm not blaming any doctors for the sepsis because post-operative infection is a risk with any surgery, but I strongly believe medics need to be better trained to spot it.

'I'm only here because the right doctor happened to walk past my bed at a critical moment, when my organs were starting to fail.'
