A rocket fired from Gaza has struck a house in southern Israel as Palestinians prepare for the funeral of a teenager murdered in 'revenge' for the kidnap and killing of three Jewish schoolboys.

The Israeli military said more than a dozen rockets were fired by militants overnight, one of which struck a house in Sderot - a small town close to Israel's border with Gaza - with no reported injuries.

The violence comes ahead of the funeral of Mohammed Abu Khdeir - a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who was kidnapped and killed yesterday in an apparent revenge attack for the murder of three Israeli teenagers whose bodies were discovered in the West Bank earlier this week.

Although Abu Khdeir's funeral was scheduled to take place today, it has now been delayed as police carrying out a postmortem have not yet released his body members of his family.

Grief: Relatives of Mohammed Abu Khudair mourn in Shuafat - an Arab suburb of Jerusalem - following the discovery of his beaten and charred body body in nearby woodland yesterday

Mohammed Abu Khdeir's family accuses extremist Jews of having killed the teenager in revenge for the killing of Israeli schoolboys Gil-Ad Shaer, Naftali Fraenkel, both 16, and Eyal Yifrah, 19.

Police say Abu Khdeir's death is still under investigation.

The discovery of his beaten and charred body in woodland outside East Jerusalem yesterday - after he was apparently kidnapped from a supermarket car park in nearby Shuafat - sparked fierce clashes between Palestinian youths and Israeli police across the country yesterday.

Palestinian residents said they saw a teenager being forced into a vehicle outside the supermarket.

Micky
 Rosenfeld, a spokesman for Israeli police, said police had been 
notified of a youth 'pulled into a vehicle and possibly kidnapped' and 
roadblocks were set up in search of suspects.'Â

Later
 'police discovered a body in the Jerusalem forest and were looking to 
see if there was a connection between the missing youth and the body 
that was found,' Rosenfeld said.

A security source speaking on condition 
of anonymity said Israel suspected Mohammed Abu Khdair had been kidnapped and 
killed, possibly in retribution for the killings of the Israeli teens.

Following the discovery of Abu Khdair's body, his father Hussein told the Jerusalem Post:
 'I feel as though I lost my boy... He was an excellent student. He 
loved a lot of people and they loved him. There are a lot of people in 
my house right now, maybe a thousand.'

Describing his son's death, Mr Abu
 Khdeir said: 'My son went to the mosque for morning prayers... Two 
people got out of a car, took him, kidnapped him, forced him into the 
car, and sped away.

'We
 have their picture and their license plate number. We called the police
 right away, and we told the police that we know where he is because he 
has a cell phone, and they did nothing,' he added.

Mr Khdeir later said that his son's funeral - originally scheduled for today - would now have to be delayed as officials carrying out a postmortem have not yet released his body to family members.

Amid heightened tensions following the discovery of the Palestinian teenager's body, violent protests broke out in East Jerusalem's Shuafat refugee camp.

Young men threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers in both East Jerusalem and the West Bank city of Jenin, as special forces were sent to quell anger over the death of Abu Khdair's death.

The grim 
discovery of his body came just hours after angry protests broke out over the murder
 of the three Jewish teens in the West Bank, during which some 
reportedly shouted 'death to the Arabs'.

Israel says the militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, abducted and killed the Israeli teens. Hamas has praised the kidnappings, but it has not claimed responsibility.

Rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes have intensified since the teens went missing.

Israel responded to the missiles fired from Gaza overnight with a number of air strikes which left 10 people injured.

'The Israeli Air Force attacked 15 terror sites in Gaza early Thursday morning,' an  Israel Defence Forces official said.

'The targets included weapons manufacturing sites as well as training facilities,' he added.
