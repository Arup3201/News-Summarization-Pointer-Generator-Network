The ice caves of Alaska are virtually impenetrable for most explorers - but for a drone,  they are easy to get in (and out) of.

A team of filmmakers took their quadcopter to a remote series of caves to create this incredible footage of the area rarely seen by humans.

The team was able to fly through channels in the ice to gain entry to caves, and fly high above the breathtaking terrain to show the scales of the ice caves.

The team used a commercially available drone called a DJI Phantom and a GoPro HERO3+ Black Edition to capture the footage

Los Angeles film company Firefight films travelled to the Mendenhall Glacier in Alaska to make the film.

The idea came from DSLRpros, which sells the quadcopters,' Christopher Carson, the producer of the film, told MailOnline.

The video, part of a film project entitled 'Bigger Than Life,' was produced in collaboration with DSLR Pros, an aerial film production company.

'They lent us a quadcopter for a film we're making on snowmobiling, and wanted to collect images and videos that are inspiring, videos of awe.

'We were thinking about what to shoot, originally we thought of really beautiful places like flower gardens in China.

'We decided to go out to the glaciers, then as soon as we saw the ice caves, we spent four days filming them.

The team flew the drone around several caves in the area, a glacier about 12 miles (19 km) long.

It is located in Mendenhall Valley, about 12 miles (19 km) from downtown Juneau in the southeast area of the U.S. state of Alaska, and is a popular tourist destination.

It uses a standard, off the shelf drone called a DJI Phantom quadcopter for the footage, which was captured on a GoPro digital camera attached to the drone, along with a heavier duty drone.

'There were a lot of nervous moments,' admitted Carson.

'In the ice caves, these drones transmit the video, so we can send it into small crevasses.

'We had problems losing signal in there, they are hundreds of feet of ice think.

'There was also a lot of  of turbulence in the caves caused by the four blades - we almost lost the quadcopters a few  times.'
