A multi-million dollar gamble by the US Department of Energy has gone sour leaving the tab for taxpayers to cover.

The Obama administration announced Friday it will lose $139 million on a loan to struggling electric car maker Fisker Automotive Inc.

The company had sold part of the loan to a private investor that took the company into bankruptcy. It is one of the government's efforts to stimulate green initiatives, which has not managed to bear fruit.

Fisker was awarded a $529 million loan 
guarantee by the administration in 2009 to produce the Karma, a $103,000
luxury hybrid car, according to Fox News.

But Fisker failed to meet DOE benchmarks, causing it to lose its loan guarantee two years later.

The company drew down on $192 million before its federal funding was pulled, and the Obama administration seized $21 million from the company in April to help repay taxpayers.

The California car marker's new owner, Hybrid Technology LLC, said it plans to keep Fisker operating after it emerges from bankruptcy. 

In 2011, the government lost $528 million in the Solyndra collapse, triggering sharp Republican criticism of the loan program and President Barack Obama's investments in green energy.

There are still plenty of nagging questions about the collapse of Solyndra, the California-based solar-panel maker that went bankrupt after getting $535 million worth of loan guarantees from the Obama administration.

However, according to House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Pa., and House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Tim Murphy, R-Pa., who issued a joint statement, ‘the Fisker collapse closes ‘yet another sad chapter in DOE's troubled portfolio’.

‘The jobs that were promised never materialized and, once again, taxpayers are on the hook for the administration’s reckless gamble.’

The venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers - where Al Gore is a partner - was a seed investor in Fisker and spent $400,000 in 2009 and 2010 on lobbying, according to Fox.

The firm helped push for the stimulus bill that handed out $90 billion in green energy programs.

Energy spokesman, Bill Gibbons, said on Friday the department's actions mean the Energy Department has protected nearly three-quarters of its original commitment to Fisker.

‘While this result is not what anyone hoped, the ($139 million loss) represents less than 2 per cent of our advanced vehicle loans, and less than one-half of 1 per cent of our overall loan program portfolio’ of more than $30 billion, Gibbons said.
