Police are looking for a pair of thieves on the loose in New York City who stole a 14-year-old's iPhone at a concert then had the audacity to take a selfie to send to the boy's friends along with a dirty text message to his mother.

The men allegedly stole the iPhone 5 from 14-year-old James Pugliatti of Westchester on April 17 at an under 18 event at Stage 48 on 48th street in Manhattan's Upper West Side.

The mystery duo used the iPhone to take a photo of themselves on the subway and then proceeded to send the photo to all of the boy's friends on Snapchat, reported the New York Post.

The boy's mother also received a text message that said 'mom I'm so horny.'

Snapchat is an app that allows users to send pictures that disappear after a few seconds.

One of James' friends was able to take a screenshot of the Snapchat which he then forwarded to James' mother. His mother then sent the photo to the police who are on the lookout for the suspects.

James didn't only lose his phone but he also lost a $50 otter phone case.

'I was pissed. I had to get another phone,' he told the Post.

'Theyâ€™re pretty stupid. The whole thing was really annoying. It ruined my night.'

Unfortunately James did not install the 'Find my iPhone' app which allows people to locate their phone by using a log in on another phone or on a computer.

Police say the app comes in handy when looking for lost or stolen phones.

Anyone with information concerning the crime are asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS.

The Post reports that in September when a thief Jazeke Samuels, 20, from Harlem snapped selfies from himself on an i-phone he was caught 5 months later when police found his face in a mugshot database.

The photos uploaded directly to the victims photo sharing account on Apple iCloud.
