Police chiefs wanted to use money donated in memory of the Hillsborough disaster to pay for a holiday flat for officers, it has emerged.

South Yorkshire Police also suggested using Hillsborough Disaster Fund donations to pay for microwaves for police station kitchens and new gym equipment.

The suggestions were given in 1991 after trustees of the fund asked the force for ideas on how to spend 'residual money'.

Former Merseyside chief constable Sir Norman Bettison wanted £2,000 to refurbish the reception area of his police station

The majority of the £12million fund had been given to families, survivors and others affected by the disaster, including match stewards at the stadium.

But a significant amount of 'residual' funds remained, and its trustees asked police and other organisations for ideas on how they might be used.

Former Merseyside chief constable Norman Bettison, then a superintendent based in South Yorkshire Police’s F Division, requested £2,000 to refurbish the reception area of his police station, according to the documents released by the Hillsborough Independent Panel. 

The proposal for a holiday flat 'either 
home or abroad' came from Chief Inspector John Donnelly, who was in 
charge of policing Sheffield city centre on the day of the disaster.

He said it should be used by officers and their families.

Other ideas included new blinds for the force’s casualty bureau and 'better gifts' for officers on sick leave.

None of the projects are believed to have been approved by the fund’s trustees.

The disaster fund included £100,000 from Liverpool FC, as well as money from Liverpool city council and the proceeds of a charity version of Ferry Cross the Mersey featuring Paul McCartney and Gerry Marsden, which was number one for three weeks in May and June, 1989.

Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, said: 'It is one of the most shocking things I’ve heard in a long time.

'It’s not something I was previously aware of and to hear how, even in 1991 when it was clear to everyone that the police were to blame they were suggesting money should go to them to pay for microwaves and holidays, it is quite hard to believe.

'And to hear Bettison suggesting money should go to refurbish a police station is sickening.

'People often think all of that money went to the families, but they are wrong. A lot of it went elsewhere.

'I feel that 96 people died for that money - and they wanted to use it for new microwaves. It’s despicable.'

A submission from the force’s D Division asked for gymnasium equipment, including exercise bikes, and microwaves, which it said were 'always being requested' at police stations.

In his proposal, Mr Bettison identified the police control room at Hillsborough as being in need of repair, but concluded 'the room is the responsibility of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the police would therefore be deriving no benefit from such a contribution.'

He added: 'I therefore propose a preferred option that if funds are available then Hammerton Road Police Station, which was used as a reception area for friends and relatives of those who died in the disaster, should benefit.'

Sheila Coleman, of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign said: 'What makes me feel so angry about this is the fact that I asked the disaster fund would they give a small amount of money for a person who lost a family member at Hillsborough for her bus fares to college for an access course.

Sheila Coleman, of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said it shows the 'contempt officers had for the families'

'And the reply I received was "No, the 
families have already had money". I think there are people very close to
Hillsborough who have to search their consciences now for what they 
agreed to in allowing those funds to be wound up.'

She added: 'This shows the contempt authorities had for Hillsborough families and victims. It’s disgraceful.'

Deputy Chief Constable Andy Holt from South Yorkshire Police told the BBC said the force formally submitted suggestions after being approached by trustees of the fund.

He told the BBC: 'As a result, South Yorkshire Police formally submitted a number of suggestions to the trustees of the Hillsborough Disaster Fund which included enhancing the quality of the police control rooms at Hillsborough and other football stadia to improve public safety and the policing of future football matches.

'Other suggestions included the provision of better equipment for the Force's Casualty Bureau, the creation of an Occupational Health Unit and a number of community-based projects.'
