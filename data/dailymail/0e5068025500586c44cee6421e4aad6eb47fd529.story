A lovelorn New Zealand man who asked the Internet for help finding the American girl he met in Hong Kong last year on New Year's Eve has found her - and she doesn't seem too happy about it.

Reese McKee, 25, gained thousands of followers when he posted a picture of 'Katie' and his story of dancing the night away with her last December. She left him only with a first name, a hint that she lived 'in D.C.' and the alluring request: 'find me.'

He has now revealed that online sleuths did, indeed, find her. And they mobbed her with so many messages that she deleted every single one of her social media accounts within hours.

'The Facebook thing was getting out of hand. They were starting to infringe on other people. They tracked down every Katie in the DC area, which is a bit much,' Mr McKee, from Wellington, told the New Zealand Herald.

Who is she? Reese McKee, right, has launched a Facebook search for a woman named 'Katie', left, whom he met in Hong Kong on New Year's Eve. When they parted, she said: 'Find me'

'We found the girl. She is from DC, she's not there at the moment, but she's sorta taken all her public profiles offline for a little bit.'

Mr McKee says he hasn't reached out to her yet - he's waiting for the online furor to die down.

But, as one slightly horrified blogger points out, it's likely she has no desire to to speak with Mr McKee now. Their romantic night took place nearly one year ago.

'A year is enough time for someone to get married, go through several relationships, or even have a child,' blogger amiantos writes.

'Or
 maybe it’s just enough time for some lonely guy to work himself into a 
delusional fantasy that she’s waiting on the other side of it for him.'

Even Mr McKee seems a little sheepish about his quest to be reunited with the girl he had a chance meeting with a year ago. He told the Herald that he has turned down multiple media interview requests - including from ABC's Good Morning America.

Shortly after Katie was found, he deleted his Facebook profile and the Facebook event that invited fans to help find her.

Mr
 McKee says he was wandering around admiring the lights as he welcomed 
in 2013 when he spotted a girl crying at the side of the road and 
approached her.

'She was lost. She'd lost all her friends,' he told the New Zealand Herald. 'I just cheered her up. I sort of have this undeniably bad sense of humor that no one can resist laughing at.'

The
 pair spent the night dancing, drinking and chatting until 6 a.m., when 
she reconnected with her friends and they parted ways.

Before
 she vanished into the night, she told him her name and that she lived 
in 'D.C'. She posed for a photograph and left him with a bold request: 
'Find me.'

On a 
Facebook campaign, he explained that the next morning he woke up and 
discovered the picture on his cell phone - 'and the good memories came 
sweeping back'.

But he had 
few clues to track her down and when he tried to find her email address -
 he had some recollection of it containing the words 'kitty cat' - he 
had no luck.

He spent months looking for her and asked for help in a similar way on Facebook in June.

'But the timing wasn't right,' he told the Herald. 'I think this time of year people have hope for the magic [of Christmas].'

And it seems that people are catching on - with more than 4,000 people offering their support to him before he removed the Facebook page.

But while the story has gathered 
international attention - as well as questions over whether or not it is
 a hoax - the mysterious Katie has yet to be identified.

Before removing the Facebook page, McKee explained why he was looking for her.

'I was hurt a long time ago,' he wrote. 'The 
hopeless romantic in me was locked away when he got hurt because it was 
too much. For too long, this has effected my relationships, and I've 
failed people.

'Somewhere along the line my romantic soul went silent, and this is a step towards putting that right.

'While the main aim of this event has 
been to reconnect with the now infamous "Katie", it's also about me, 
finding myself and who I know I can be. I hope to find her. And along the way, find myself.'

But he said he has no illusions and that he wouldn't be surprised if Katie had another boyfriend but that he was 'foolishly optimistic'.

'The chances are billions to one, but I like those odds,' he wrote. 'The is me putting all my chips on the table because it's go hard or go home and I am not going to give in.'

He added: 'Even if I could just find her and say thanks, because it's been a life-changing year and it all started that night, really.'
