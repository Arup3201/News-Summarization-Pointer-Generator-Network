Slaven Bilic knew the importance of his No 9. When Demba Ba's late penalty nestled into Hugo Lloris' net, the Besiktas manager span, roared at the home dugout and celebrated with his staff.

'I don't want to sound big-headed but not many teams come here and get a draw. Nobody are favourites except Tottenham,' was the manager's assessment.

Once Ba trudged off after the final whistle of a game the visitors really ought to have won, Bilic was the first to embrace the striker with a man hug. It told all those at the bottom of the West Stand just what the Turks think of their new man.

A potential return to the North East may be something under-fire manager Alan Pardew and Co at St James' Park regret.

Tottenham Hotspur

After Ba's showing at White Hart Lane compared to Roberto Soldado, Spurs may wish they'd went in for the ex-Chelsea striker.

Liverpool 

Stuck with Mario Balotelli for £16million, Ba cost Besiktas half that amount. Did Liverpool miss a trick in letting Ba leave England?

West Ham

Another potential return that could have seen Sam Allardyce go a long way to keeping his promise of more attractive football.

Everton

Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto'o from Chelsea to Everton have proved successful buys so far, and Ba could have been the third.

Back in England for the second time since leaving Chelsea in the summer, the 29-year-old played as if he had something to prove. To himself, possibly. To the Premier League, definitely.

He strutted around White Hart Lane as if there was only one man to settle this game. Only a string of Lloris saves stopped Bilic and Ba would have been leaving with three precious points, almost sealing their qualification from the group in turn already.

In the end, it was left for the Senegalese to grab a point. On an evening he stood above the rest, that finale seemed fitting.

The 2,800 travelling supporters went wild - a solitary flare was let off - as Besiktas, knowing the Europa League is a gateway to Champions League qualification for first time this season, earned the least they deserved.

Bilic, when referencing the swell of support in the South West corner, joked afterwards that he wished there were as many fans in Istanbul as there are in London. Tricky to blame him given the noise projected from that area of the ground well before kick-off.

They had been allowed in particularly early on Thursday night - a wise move after the scenes around the Emirates the night before - and it filled up rather quickly. With an hour to go there were at least 1,500 already out in their seats chanting away.

That would give any team a lift. There they were, hollered on to their warm up - similarly so when the XI came out half-an-hour later. Ba thrived and meant business.

He was pumped up, thrashing an arm towards Vlad Chiriches in the opening minutes and being handed a relatively harsh booking. That knock riled Spurs, from which their back four never really recovered.

There is a sense of mystery surrounding why Jose Mourinho opted to allow Ba to leave Stamford Bridge in the summer in favour of splashing £8.5million Loic Remy - for all his goalscoring prowess - doesn't impose himself on matches in quite the same way.

Ba's mere presence had the Tottenham central two scared of playing too high a line for fear of being caught in behind, while they were consistently beaten in the air.

With that said, Mauricio Pochettino will see this as a point gained on the road to Warsaw. Tottenham were nowhere near touching their best - not surprising given the manager had made 10 changes - and, but for Lloris, might have come away with nothing.

They missed something going forward, often lackadaisical in their approach and didn't have a focal point to hit. Harry Kane offered when dropping deeper into the No 10 but the consistent beige produced by Roberto Soldado must continue to concern.

Pochettino said afterwards that he had 'all the information' needed on the players in his squad after three months working with them. A modern day target man in Ba's mould can't be far from topping the January wishlist.
