Everybody knows a standard part of visiting a doctor involves sitting in the waiting room, thumbing through a terrible magazine, usually completely out of date and grubby with fingerprints.

One doctor was so sick of hearing patients complaining that the reading material he provided was dull and old, he decided to get to the bottom of the matter.

His research uncovered an uncomfortable truth: pilfering patients were to blame. 

His supposedly sick patients were stealing all the newer, gossipy reads in the waiting room and leaving only the older, more dry publications.

In fact, he worked out that magazine theft could cost practices in the UK a whopping £12.6 million a year, assuming that each magazine costs £3.20 on average.

A doctor carried out an investigation to find out why patients complained there were only old and dull magazines in his waiting room. He found half the magazines placed there in a month were stolen, equating to £12.6 million a year across all the practices in the UK

Professor Bruce Arroll, the beady-eyed doctor leading the research, said he carried out the study because he was flummoxed as to why patients kept complaining about the lack of up to date magazines in his waiting room, when he knew current copies had been ordered.

Writing in the BMJ, he describes his confusion: ‘The reason for this phenomenon was clearly a burning research question, given the number of times that patients had complained.’

His initial, internet-based research, revealed no results.

He said: ‘We searched Medline, Google Scholar, and grey literature for studies on missing magazines and on waiting rooms, but despite finding information on the design of waiting rooms, satisfaction with service based on the waiting room experience, and other waiting room related topics, there was nothing on the disappearance of magazines.

‘Evidence for the absence of up to date magazines was lacking and many of the articles that did mention magazines in waiting rooms said they were mainly old, consistent with our experience.

He added: ‘Quantification of this phenomenon was urgently needed.’

After hypothesizing that either practice staff only put out the old magazines or they put out reasonably recent ones and these disappeared, he designed a study to settle the matter.

Using his own office in Auckland, New Zealand, as a testing ground, he stocked the waiting area with a plethora of publications, old and new, gossipy and serious.

The clinic staff were asked to leave the magazines alone, warned ‘any failure to comply could result in the death penalty’.

‘This warning was given to ensure that everybody understood the serious nature of the study,’ Professoe Arrol said.

Gossip magazines with five or more celebrity photos on the cover were stolen 15 times faster than more serious publications

The 87 magazines were put out in three piles and marked with a unique number.

Twice a week the principal investigator came into work half an hour early to record missing magazines.

After 31 days, almost half (47 per cent) of the original 87 magazines had disappeared, the equivalent to 1.32 a day.

All but one of the 27 'gossipy' magazines – those that had five or more photos of celebrities on the front cover - had disappeared.

Within this group, 15 magazines were defined as ‘most gossipy’ as they had ten or more photographs of celebrities on the cover. They all went missing.

Worried about litigation from publishers, the doctors did not reveal the names of magazines defined as 'gossipy'.  

Of the 19 'non-gossipy' magazines (four Time magazines and 15 of the Economist), none had disappeared.

In order to cut costs, the researchers said serious magazines like Time and the Economist should be layed out, as they were not stolen

Gossip magazines disappeared nearly 15 times faster than non-gossipy ones, it was revealed. 

The researchers also noted current magazines were more likely to go missing than older ones, with 60 per cent of the magazines stolen less than two months old.

The researchers worked out that if they extrapolate their findings to the 8,000 practices in Britain, each month £12.6 million disappears from general practices – assuming each magazine costs an average of £3.20.

These are ‘resources that could be better used for healthcare,’ they said.

They concluded that ‘practices should consider using old copies of the Economist and Time magazine as a first step towards saving costs.’

They said they hope their research might trigger the development of a ‘find my magazine’ app.

Future research could also examine how receptionists cope in a waiting room without gossipy magazines, they added.
