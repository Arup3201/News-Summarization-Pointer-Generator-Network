The Duchess of Cambridge stepped out in a slim-fitting Hobbs coat for an official visit today, proving that just because she is pregnant she will not be compromising on style.

The brown Celeste coat, from Hobbs 2011 collection, cost £369 originally but was reduced to £182 in 'the sale last year - and sold out in under an hour after the duchess was pictured wearing it in 2012.

Today, despite being almost six months pregnant, the duchess looked almost as slender as she did when she first wore the coat on a Valentine's Day visit to Liverpool, her tiny bump barely visible beneath the narrow belt encircling her midriff.

need for maternity clothes! Kate chose the slim-fitting, belted brown 
Celeste coat from High Street store Hobbs for today's visit to Grimsby - and 
managed to fasten the belt around her slim midriff despite being almost 
six months pregnant

Then, she paired the coat with a warm black sweater dress. Today though, despite the mercury resting at a chilly three degrees centigrade, the duchess wore a lower-cut top, the lace trim just showing at the V-neck of the coat.related]

The only difference between today's styling and that of 2012 was in the positioning of the belt. Today it was a fraction higher than it was last year, and the fabric was gently filled out by Kate's neat bump.

The Duchess of Cambridge was in Grimsby for a tour of the town's fishing heritage centre where she was set to meet jobless young people on a Prince's Trust scheme.[

The duchess, who was set to arrive by helicopter, was delayed due to thick fog, a Palace official said.

She was due to arrive in the North East Lincolnshire town by helicopter for 11.35am and crowds had gathered in her honour.

The
Duchess of Cambridge championed the British high street yet again today
as she chose a brown belted coat from Hobbs that she bought two years ago.

Kate last wore the coat on Valentine's Day 2012 - and an hour later the coat, which had been discounted to £182, had sold out on the Hobbs website.

The
chestnut brown coat was the perfect fit for the slender Duchess - a muted chocolate tone and simple, classic cut meaning the focus could remain on her work for the day rather than her choice of 
outfit.

The 
single-breasted style was nothing high fashion or too trendy - but it 
was given a contemporary edge with stud-fastening cuff straps and a 
leather belt.

Hobbs chairman Iain MacRitchie has said of Kate's fondness for the brand: 'We
are delighted to see our designers getting recognition for their 
creative talent and the Hobbs brand credentials.

'With the UK's strength and depth of contemporary British designer 
fashion it is fantastic to see this important industry increasingly 
getting a worldwide profile.'
