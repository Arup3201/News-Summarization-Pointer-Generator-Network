Legal highs have caused a surge in hospital admissions in the UK, a report has warned, as it emerged Britain has become a hub of Europe's booming online designer drug market.

The report from the International Narcotics Control Board said the number of websites supplying mind-altering substances to Europe has increased by 300 per cent in just two years - and around one fifth of those sites are hosted on servers based in Britain.

The 'unprecedented' increase in the emergence of new psychoactive substances has led to increases in hospital admissions and medical appointments in the UK, along with reports of health problems caused by regular use of designer drugs, it said.

'Major challenge': The rise of so-called legal highs like mephedrone, also known as meow meow, has seen a rise in hospital admissions in the UK, a report found

The INCB study said the abuse of illicit drugs in Europe has stabilised in recent years, albeit at a high level.

Mephedrone - which was banned and made a class B drug in 2010 - was the third most popular drug among those aged 16 to 59. Abuse of the club drug, also known as Meow Meow, Bubbles and M-Cat, was at 1.4 per cent in England and Wales in the period 2010/11

The UK is the only major European country allowing the import of khat, a substance widely consumed in East Africa and parts of the Middle East for its stimulating effects

The number of foreign nationals being used as couriers to smuggle drugs into the UK, Canada and the US has risen.

But the emergence of psychoactive substances - so-called designer drugs or legal highs - posed a 'major challenge', it said.

While overall drug-related deaths in Britain fell by 14 per cent from 2009 to 2010, fatalities caused by the abuse of new substances increased significantly, from six cases in 2008 to 44 cases in 2009, the study from the UN body found.

However, it did not state the exact figures that showed the surge in hospital admissions.

It said: 'In recent years, there has been an unprecedented increase in the emergence of new psychoactive substances not within the purview of the international drug control conventions.'

It added: 'The number of Internet-based retail sites selling psychoactive products and shipping to European Union member States increased from 170 in January 2010 to 314 in January 2011 and 690 in January 2012.

More than 130 sites were registered in the UK.

'About a third of them were hosted on servers based in the United States, and a fifth of them were hosted on servers based in the United Kingdom.'

Citing figures from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, it said the number of notifications relating to new psychoactive substances hit 49 in 2011, meaning a new drug appeared on the market almost every week.

It said: 'Although it is impossible to know the exact number of new psychoactive substances on the market, experts have advanced estimates running well into the thousands.

'As abuse of these substances has increased, so too has the number of users who have experienced grave health consequences or even suffered death due to exposure to them.

Concerns: While overall drug related deaths in Britain have fallen, those caused by the abuse of new substances increased significantly, the report found

'In many countries, use of such substances has manifested itself in marked increases in emergency room visits for adverse health reactions caused by the ingestion of new psychoactive substances, as well as in significant increases in calls to poison treatment centres.'

The study found 'mounting evidence' to suggest many new drugs were being manufactured in China and India.

It concluded: 'A particular challenge to Government efforts to place new psychoactive substances under national control is the difficulty of identifying those substances in a timely manner, given the rapid succession of new substances entering the market, their inconsistent chemical composition and the lack of technical and pharmacological data and reference material, as well as insufficient forensic and toxicological capacity on the part of some states.'
