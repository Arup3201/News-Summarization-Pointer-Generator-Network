Since childhood, Annabelle has struggled with her weight, weighing 328lbs by the time she graduated high school. 

Thanks to healthy diet and exercise, in just one year Annabelle lost 140lbs  and currently weighs 155lbs.  

In order to complete her body confidence make-over, Annabelle must star in a People photoshoot, where the magazine's Style and Beauty Director, Andrea Lavinthal, eases her into it by giving her some much needed fashion advice.

Meanwhile Lori, whose weight grew to 240lbs after the birth of her first child, lost 120lbs thanks to her work's 'get healthy' program.

Using food as an emotional comfort after giving birth, Lori became ashamed of her appearance and refused to leave the house. 

But after losing half her weight through food and exercise, she doesn't know how to dress her new body, and instead has been relying on ill-filling hand-me-downs. 

On the show, Mary Alice helps Lori discover the right approach to her style, just in time to attend an important company event.
