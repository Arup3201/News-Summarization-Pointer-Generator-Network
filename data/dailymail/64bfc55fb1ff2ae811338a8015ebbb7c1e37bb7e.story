Mystery: Sylvain Mollier, 45, was shot seven times by a pistol-wielding assassin a year and four months ago

French police have ‘all but closed’ an investigation into a mystery cyclist who was shot dead in the Alps along with three members of a British-Iraqi family, it emerged yesterday.

This is despite the first image of Sylvain Mollier being released – exactly a year and four months after the atrocity.

The long delay has led to claims of a cover up being mounted around the 45-year-old’s past life.

He was shot seven times by a pistol-wielding assassin, but the French led inquiry continues to focus on the al-Hilli family, who lived in Claygate, Surrey, as the attackers’ main target.

An alleged ‘vow of silence’ by those close to Mollier has fuelled claims that an individual or group known to him wanted him dead.

Mollier’s body was found in a forest layby near Lake Annecy in eastern France on September 5, 2012.

Close by, in a BMW estate car, Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, lay dead.

Each had been shot three times, all at least once in the head. Their two daughters, Zeena, then 4, and Zainab, then 7, survived.

The focus of the inquiry has so far been on a dispute that Saad is believed to have had with his 54-year-old brother, Zaid, over their father’s inheritance.

Mollier was, however, involved in a dispute over a lucrative pharmacy business that was being transferred to his girlfriend, Claire Schutz, a 30-year-old heiress, by her parents.

Mollier had just had a son with Schutz and had given up his job as a metalworker at a factory making nuclear components.

There was tension over the amount of cash that Mollier was accepting from Schutz, including the money to buy the £4,000 racing bike that he rode to his death. Detectives have also uncovered romantic entanglements that Mollier was trying to keep secret.

Ongoing: French authorities insist the al-Hilli family, from Claygate, is the focus of the investigation

But a French police spokesman said today: ‘The focus of the investigations remains the al-Hilli family. It appears that the cyclist was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enquiries into his background are all but closed.’

The refusal of the French authorities to release a picture of Mollier has prompted the television channel France 2 to show it in its documentary programme Non Elucidé (Unresolved) yesterday and to put it on the internet in the hope of jogging people’s memories.

The undated image, provided by a former colleague, shows Mollier in the football kit of his firm, Cezus, before a match. Detectives have confirmed his identity.

Zaid al-Hilli, a payroll manager from Chessington, Surrey, who was arrested last year but provided police with a confirmed alibi, is convinced Mollier was the real target, saying in October: ‘They are covering up for someone in France in that region and they know it. There is something more to it locally.’
