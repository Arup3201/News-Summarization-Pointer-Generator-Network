Arsenal will read Jack Wilshere the riot act when he reports for pre-season training on Sunday.

The Gunners midfielder was due back in London on Tuesday following his controversial trip to Las Vegas, where he was caught with a cigarette for the second time in nine months.

Wilshere was on the receiving end of stinging criticism from Gunners legend George Graham yesterday and he will face further wrath when he returns to the club's London Colney HQ.

Wenger, who is a staunch anti-smoker, is said to be far from impressed by the photographs of Wilshere, together with England team-mates Joe Hart and James Milner, behaving outrageously in Vegas.

Naturally, the Arsenal manager is concerned by the effects smoking will have on Wilshere's fitness.

However, Wenger is also frustrated by the fact Wilshere has again tarnished his own - and the club's reputation - by his behaviour.

Wilshere was spotted with a cigarette 
just a few days before a match in October and vowed that there would not
 be a repeat situation.

Club officials will remind the talented 22-year-old of his responsibilities when he returns for pre-season training, while Wenger will also reprimand Wilshere.

Speaking yesterday ex-Arsenal manager Graham said: 'Arsene Wenger has to have a word with Jack and tell him the responsibility he has now got.

'His career has not gone anywhere in the last 18 months.'
