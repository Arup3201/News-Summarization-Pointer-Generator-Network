Great Britain's Lynsey Sharp just fell short in her bid to retain the European crown, as not even a personal-best performance was enough for her to add gold to the 800 metres silver from the Commonwealth Games.

A fortnight ago, the 24-year-old became the pride of Scotland after overcoming the odds to secure a podium finish at Hampden Park.

Sharp was on a drip in the athletes' village clinic until 5.30am on the morning of the Glasgow final, yet managed to win silver after a wonderful late surge.

Disappointed: Even a personal best was not enough for Sharp to take the gold

It was the Scottish middle-distance runner's second senior medal, with the first having arrived at the European Championships in Helsinki two years earlier.

Sharp only received the 800m title a year on from the race in Finland, having been upgraded from second after Russia's Yelena Arzhakova received a two-year doping ban.

In the build-up to this edition, she spoke of her desire to top the podium outright - something she was just unable to manage due to a Europe-leading time from Maryna Arzamasova.

The Belarusian was the only one to keep up with pacesetter Sharp, who tailed off down the home straight and was pipped to the line despite recording a PB of one minute 58.80 seconds in taking silver.
