Technology company IBM is putting its supercomputer Watson to work - in a robot call centre.

The artificially intelligent computer system is taking on the role of customer service manager and will be called Watson Engagement Advisor.

Companies will be able to sign up to IBM's service and its customers can then ring a helpline and complain or get help from the Question Answering (QA) machine.

The IBM Watson Mobile Developer Challenge invited teams to design mobile apps using Watson's, pictured, cognitive computing capabilities. The 25 finalists will now submit prototypes for judging, after which only five teams will present proposals to IBM. Three winners will get access to the Watson's developer platform

Customers will be able to ask the Watson Engagement Advisor questions by phone, email and instant messaging. A smartphone app called 'Ask Watson' (pictured) is due to launch later this year

In February 2011 Watson appeared on American quiz show Jeopardy.

During the show, clues are given to
 contestants that 'require analysis and understanding of subtle meaning,
 irony, riddles and other language complexities' that humans can perform
 naturally but computers, traditionally, do not. 

Watson had to be programmed to make decisions and conclusions in this way by a team of experts at IBM.

During the show, Watson was given clues as electronic texts, as they were also presented to the human contestants.

Watson would then parse the clues into different keywords and sentence fragments in order to find statistically related phrases.

The more algorithms that find the same answer independently the more likely Watson was to be correct.

Once Watson had a number of 
potential solutions, it was able to check against its database to make 
sure the answers made sense. 

Watson then evaluated the response and determined whether to virtually press the buzzer.

Watson would then speak with an 
electronic voice synthesized from recordings that actor Jeff Woodman 
made for an IBM text-to-speech program in 2004.

Watson has previously taken part in American 
quiz show Jeopardy, and has helped medical research teams diagnose illnesses
 in patients.

This latest role will use the computer's internal knowledge database to handle customer complaints.

With the new service customers can ask Watson questions using conversational language during a phone call.

They can also ask questions to Watson through web forms, emails and an Instant Messaging service.

An app, called 'Ask Watson' is also expected to launch later this year.

Brands that have already signed up to try out IBM's Watson Engagement Advisor include ANZ, Celcom, Nielsen and Royal Bank of Canada.

IBM said the Watson Engagement Advisor wiill be able to 'quickly address customers' questions, offer advice to guide their 
purchase decisions, and troubleshoot their problems.'

IBM Watson will also be able to proactively engage with customers, as well as learn from calls and complaints to make handling future queries faster and more accurately.

Jon Simon from the IBM Watson team shows off the range of 'Ask Watson' apps coming later this year. Companies including Nielsen and the Bank of Canada have already signed up to test the Watson Engagement Advisor. Watson can adapt its responses and the way it handles customers depending on the company the customer is calling about

The service will use IBM's Big Data Analytics 
technologies to gather data about customers and make sure the answers 
are best suited to them. 

Watson
 will also then be able to better personalise its responses based on the
 company, and the type of customer, for future calls too.

Manoj Saxena, general manager of IBM Watson Solutions wrote in a blog post: We’re widening the scope that the [Watson] technology addresses.

And, as far as I’m concerned, this is just the start.

This 
next era of computing is going to touch all of our lives in positive 
ways we can’t yet imagine.'

Saxena continued: 'Customer engagement is a natural fit for Watson, which can instantly create a strong bond between who customers are as individuals, and what types of information will help them reach their goals.

The end product: users will come away feeling known as people, empowered as consumers, and engaged as satisfied brand ambassadors who are willing to champion the business to friends and family.'

In February 2011, Watson competed on American quiz show Jeopardy.

During the show, clues are given to
 contestants that 'require analysis and understanding of subtle meaning,
 irony, riddles and other language complexities' that humans can perform
 naturally but computers, traditionally, do not. 

Watson had to be programmed to make decisions and conclusions in this way by a team of experts at IBM.

In 2011 IBM's Watson computer competed against Jeopardy's two most successful contestants, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. During the practice match Watson was given the same questions as the other contestants and could virtually press the buzzer to answer. In the majority of cases Watson beat both contestants

During the mock games, Watson was given clues as electronic texts, as they were also asked to the human contestants.

Watson then parsed the clues into different keywords and sentence fragments in order to find 'statistically related phrases'.

The more algorithms that find the same answer independently the more likely Watson was to be correct.

electronic voice synthesized from recordings that actor Jeff Woodman 
made for an IBM text-to-speech program in 2004.

Since its television debut, IBM claim that Watson is
 'smarter, faster and smaller - having gained a 240% improvement 
in system performance, and a reduction in physical requirements by 75%.'

Watson's cognitive computing system can be run on a single Power
 750 server using Linux, which turns it from the size of a master bedroom to the size of four pizza boxes.

Businesses that use IBM 
Watson can have the solution up and running quickly using a cloud 
computing environment, or deploy the technology on-premise.
