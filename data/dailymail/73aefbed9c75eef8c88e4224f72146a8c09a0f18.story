A California man has finally undergone surgery to remove a 200lb tumour that has been growing on his abdomen for the last 14 years.

Larry West, 63, first noticed the growth in 1999 and it has since rapidly enlarged to stretch from his belly button to his feet, making it nearly impossible to walk and causing painful infections.

For years, doctors refused to operate because of the risks involved, while Mr West could not find an insurance company which would cover the costs.

But he has now found a doctor willing to carry out the procedure under a new insurance plan.

'Like carrying a 200lb sack of potatoes all the time': Larry West before his operation to remove a person-sized tumour which has been growing on his abdomen for the last 14 years

Risky procedure: Surgeons carry out the first of three operations at Memorial Hospital in Bakersfield, California, to remove the growth which stretches from Mr West's belly button to his feet

'It just kept growing larger and larger,' Mr West said. 'I have a hanging 150lb to 200lb sack of potatoes hauling around on me all of the time.'

His wife, Charlotte, said the growth gave her husband 'teeth-chattering chills' and high fevers often in the middle of the night.

Dr Vip Dev, from Memorial Hospital in Bakersfield, has now agreed to oversee the operations despite the risks.

The growth, which is caused by hardened fat and infected hair follicles, has its own blood supply, but doctors are not entirely sure what it is made of.

Risks: Surgeon Dr Vip Dev (left) from Bakersfield Memorial Hospital (right) said the tumour was so big doctors couldn't fit Mr West into the scanning equipment to analyse what was inside the growth

Dr Dev told KGET: 'These things grow into balls of what we call fibrous scar tissue, and literally, he has multiple of those.

'And they are so big, you can't even study them because we don't have an M.R.I. or C.T. scan to be able to fit him in.'

The surgeon removed around 32lbs of skin and tissue in the first of three operations on Tuesday.

Mr West will remain in hospital for two to three weeks and is expected to make a full recovery in three to four months.

'I'm so looking forward to doing regular things,' said Mr West. 'It's going to change my life tremendously.'
