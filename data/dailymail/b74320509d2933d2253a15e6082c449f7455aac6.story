True&Co collected information about the shape of 500,000 women's breasts to create a range of bras (pictured) designed to fit different shaped bodies

Shopping for a comfortable bra can sometimes prove a surprisingly complicated and frustrating ordeal.

But now one company claims to have created a collection of bras that fit differently shaped women perfectly - based on information collected from over 500,000 females.

Over two years, True&Co used seven million different data points to analyse the shape of all these women.

And they discovered a staggering 6,000 different breast shapes.

Data scientists in San Francisco trawled through the information to create a ‘Uniform’ line of underwear that promises to fit perfectly, Tech Crunch reported.

The company launched in 2012 as an online fitting room that let customers find a suitable bra using an online quiz, which includes a clever algorithm.

The method was developed by Michelle Lam and Aarthi Ramamurthy and uses information given by a customer in a questionnaire to determine her shape and what kind of bra she should be wearing.

Now that the company has been trading for two years, it has built up a considerable amount of data which has allowed it to personalise bras further and create a colour-coded system called True Spectrum, which looks a little like a paint chart.

‘You would not believe the amount of data our system has to deal with in real time. It knocks us on our butt sometimes,’ chief executive Michelle Lam said.

There are eight different categories on the colour wheel (pictured), which are based on the size, shape and curvature of breasts. 'Citrine' is the most common shape, with around 28 per cent of women having full and round breasts

The system claims to help people with smaller rib
 cages and large breasts avoid a bra ‘muffin top’, and those with a 
shallower chest, dodge painful underwired bras.

There are eight different categories on the colour wheel, which are based on the size, shape and curvature of breasts. ‘Citrine’ is the most common shape, with around 28 per cent of women having full and round breasts.

Lam said that curvature is the most important feature in trying to build a comfortable bra, but it is often overlooked by retailers.

True & Co launched two years ago and aims to find the perfect bras for its customers by using a unique algorithm. Different shapes are pictured

She 
explained that if women have a flat sternum, underwiring in bras can 
cause pain, regardless of how well the rest of the bra fits.

The
 duo are still working on perfecting the algorithm, and admitted that 
their bras for ‘Mulberry’ type women do not fit as well as they might.

Lam
 thinks that as more women take the company’s online quiz, their product
 line will diversify and women with more unusual proportions will be 
able to buy a bra that really fits them.

‘This
 is just the beginning of the future of shopping. True&Co has only 
just scratched the surface on its goal to deliver on the perfect fit,’ 
she said.

A Japanese lingerie company has created a concept bra that claims to be able to sense when a woman is in love.

Ravijour recently engineered a concept bra that only undoes when ‘true love’ is detected using a built-in heart monitor, that syncs with a smartphone app.

The bra is not currently on sale and there is no indication as to whether it will be made, but the prototype has a front clasp with a sensor and a light that glows pink if the wearer is in love with a person nearby.

In a promotional video, the sensor monitors the smart bra wearer’s heart rate and transmits the data in realtime to an iPhone app using a Bluetooth connection.

An app seemingly processes the data – measuring heart rate elevation using a specially built algorithm as well as pre-set data - and only when a woman’s heart rate is suitably elevated and she is in love does the bra catch open.

While some would-be wearers might worry that any excitement might cause their underwear to ping off, the creators of the bra say that the catch will only be released when a woman is in love so that her Adrenal Medulla (part of the adrenal gland) secretes the hormone Catecholamine, which increases her heart rate.
