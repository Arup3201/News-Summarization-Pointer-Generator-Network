David Cameron’s controversial campaigns chief will be allowed to keep his corporate clients secret until after the general election – despite new legislation designed to clean up the lobbying industry.

There have been claims that Lynton Crosby may have influenced recent Government climbdowns on cigarettes and alcohol.

But Downing Street has refused to name the clients for whom the Australian elections guru lobbies.

Ed Miliband yesterday called on Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to investigate Mr Crosby’s influence within Government.

During angry clashes in the Commons, the Labour leader called Mr Cameron the ‘Prime Minister for Benson and Hedge Funds’ – a reference to Mr Crosby’s alleged role in the ditching of Government plans to force tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plain packets.

It had been thought Mr Crosby would be forced to name his clients under legislation on lobbying which was finally published yesterday.

The Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trades Union Administration Bill will introduce a statutory register of lobbyists and their clients, with firms forced to name the clients they represent in talks with ministers and officials.

It will also impose a £390,000 limit on 
the amount organisations other than political parties or candidates can 
spend on campaigning during parliamentary elections and will require 
unions to provide accurate membership lists.

'Prime Minister for Benson and Hedge Funds'

What Labour leader Ed Miliband called David Cameron in the Commons

But a protracted timetable for implementation means it is unlikely to come into force before the 2015 election.

Mr Cameron yesterday insisted the controversy about Mr Crosby’s role was a ‘complete red herring’, and said Mr Crosby had no input into decisions to ditch minimum alcohol pricing and plain cigarette packets.

But both he and Downing Street refused to say if the Prime Minister had discussed the issues with Mr Crosby before agreeing the U-turns.

Number 10 also refused to name  Mr Crosby’s clients, or to confirm whether Mr Cameron knows who they are.

And aides would not say whether Mr Cameron – who once warned that lobbying was ‘the next big scandal waiting to happen’ – now wants Mr Crosby to name his clients to end the suspicion about his role.

Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, a GP, blamed ‘parasitical’ lobbyists for the U-turns on cigarettes and alcohol, and said that the public had the ‘right to know’ who was paying Mr Crosby for his services.

Mr Miliband asked Sir Jeremy to investigate whether Mr Cameron had breached the ministerial code, which bans any activity which might be seen as a conflict of interest.

He said the employment of Mr Crosby, whose clients have included tobacco giant Philip Morris, as an adviser to the Tory Party created ‘a back-door breach’ of the code.

Tamasin Cave, of the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency, condemned the measures as a ‘sham’, saying they would shed little light on the murky world of lobbying.
