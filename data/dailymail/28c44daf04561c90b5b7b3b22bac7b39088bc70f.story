A U.S. congressman who once seriously warned that a U.S. military buildup on the island of Guam could make it 'tip over and capsize' launched into a speech on the House floor on Thursday mocking about funny-voiced clowns and children without helium for their latex and mylar inflatables.

'Imagine, Mr. Speaker, a world without balloons,' Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson urged.

'How can we make sure that the injustice of there being no helium for comedians to get that high-pitched voice that we all hold near and dear to our hearts.'

'Too often lately, this body has sat deflated - not for lack of hot air, mind you,' Johnson continued. 'But seriously, ladies and gentlemen, unlike a noble element, this House has failed to act on Americansâ€™ real concerns.'

Johnson's spokesman, Andy Phelan, told The Washington Post that Johnson was only half-joking.

He was annoyed at Republicans, Phelan said, for devoting so much time debating a bill about helium instead of 'working on more important issues such as creating jobs, fixing the sequester and on budget issues.'

'This tea party Congress,' Johnson mocked during his speech, 'will make the tough choice to keep children's birthday parties on schedule, and give industries that rely on helium the lift that they deserve.'

When Johnson speaks, a rim-shot is often not far behind.

In 2010 the congressman said during a House Armed Services Committee hearing that an increased presence of military personnel on Guam could literally destroy the island by making its weight unbalanced.

'My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize,' Johnson said.

'We don't anticipate that,' replied Navy Admiral Robert Willard - to his credit, without laughing.

Natural gas wells are the most abundant source of natural helium, something which - like the physical makeup of islands - may have escaped Hank Johnson's notice

The helium legislation, which the House passed 394-1 on Friday, will allow the federal government to continue selling off its domestic supplies of helium on the open market. That, say Republicans, will help prop up prices for domestic manufacturers by keeping supplies low.

The current sell-off policy, originally a temporary measure designed to help the government's helium program pay off its debts, is set to expire later this year.

Helium is plentiful in the earth's crust, and is harvested as a byproduct of natural gas drilling. Most existing deposits are sitting in depleted gas wells, waiting for industry to extract them.
