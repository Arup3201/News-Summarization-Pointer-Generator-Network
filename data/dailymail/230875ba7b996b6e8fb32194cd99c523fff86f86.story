The next time you have to cram on to a train with a heavy suitcase, or catch a crowded bus carrying shopping, spare a thought for this man who cycled across Addis Ababa with a goat on his back.

A film of the unknown man giving a piggyback to a goat in the Ethiopian capital was uploaded to YouTube yesterday.

As stunned drivers look on, the man calmly pedals down the busy road, seemingly unaware that there is anything amiss.

Needs must: A man has been filmed cycling down a busy road in Addis Ababa while giving a goat a piggyback

The country's poor infrastructure makes it difficult and expensive to get goods to market

Meanwhile the goat clings on with its arms and legs tucked round the man's chest, appearing relaxed as it glances at passersby.

Bizarrely the goat doesn't appear to be fixed to the man's back, though YouTube users commenting on the video have suggested his goat's feet could be tied together.

The short 30-second clip has gone viral this afternoon, attracting more than 20,000 views since it was posted yesterday.

Hardy: Remarkably, neither the man nor the goat appear any way ill at ease

The man's unusual method of transporting his cattle is perhaps not so strange in light of the fact that the majority of Ethiopians are desperately poor as a result of a tumultuous 20th Century of droughts, famine and war.

The country's poor infrastructure makes it difficult and expensive to get goods to market, even though nearly half of its gross domestic product comes from agriculture.

According to the World Bank, the nation's gross national income per capita is just Â£221, although in recent years it has become one of fastest growing non-oil economies in Africa.
