The 38-year-old retired last year after capping his cycling career with a fifth and sixth Olympic gold at London 2012.

It was following a hat-trick of medals at the Beijing games in 2008 that he was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

The awards are being hosted in Scotland for the first time this year.

Rory McIlroy and Lewis Hamilton will battle it out to win the prestigious title at the SSE Hydro after being confirmed among the shortlist of 10 contenders.

Sir Chris, from Edinburgh, said: 'It's a huge honour to be receiving the lifetime achievement award.

'I never thought I'd see my name alongside the likes of Sir Steve Redgrave, David Beckham, Seve Ballesteros and others who've received this incredible honour, and it makes it even more special to be receiving the award in Scotland.'

BBC Sport director Barbara Slater said: 'As a former BBC Sports Personality of the Year winner, Sir Chris Hoy has been a tremendous ambassador for sport and, although he has retired from cycling, continues to be an inspiration to young athletes.

'It's fantastic that he is not only being recognised for his exceptional achievements, but also that it is being awarded to him in his home country.'

McIlroy is odds-on favourite to become the first golfer to win the award since Nick Faldo in 1989 after helping Europe to Ryder Cup success.

Hamilton's second Formula One world title in Abu Dhabi makes him another strong contender.

Real Madrid star Gareth Bale, boxer Carl Froch, world gymnastics silver medallist Max Whitlock and multiple European and Commonwealth Games swimming gold medallist Adam Peaty are also up for the title.

Winter Olympic gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold, veteran European athletics champion Jo Pavey, dressage rider Charlotte Dujardin and Britain's first Winter Paralympic champion Kelly Gallagher - with her guide Charlotte Evans - complete the nominations.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: 'Sir Chris Hoy is a wonderful ambassador not only for his sport, but for Scotland as well, and I am delighted that he is to receive this award in front of a home crowd.

'This award is testament to the commitment and drive Sir Chris has shown throughout his career, and he continues to show a passion for cycling by inspiring the next generation of sport stars. He is truly deserving of such an accolade and I join the many others in offering my warmest congratulations to him.'
