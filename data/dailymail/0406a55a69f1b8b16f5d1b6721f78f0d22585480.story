Bayern Munich are planning to give former president Uli Hoeness a job in the youth department if he receives day parole in January.

Hoeness began serving a three-and-a-half year sentence for tax evasion in June. He stepped down as president of Germany's biggest club after being convicted in March.

His successor, Karl Hopfner, says it was Hoeness' wish to work in the youth department of the Bundesliga champions once he is allowed to work outside prison during the day.

Hoeness will get an employee's contract and the club hopes he can start in January.

Hopfner says it will be 'an incredible salvation' for Hoeness 'to be among us again.'

Former West Germany international Hoeness played for Bayern Munich from 1970 to 1979.
