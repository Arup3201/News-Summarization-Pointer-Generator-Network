Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson hopes the signing of Mario Balotelli quickly lifts the squad after their loss at Manchester City.

New arrival Balotelli watched from the stands as the Reds were beaten 3-1 by his former club at the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League on Monday night.

The controversial Italy striker had completed his £16million move to the Anfield club from AC Milan earlier in the day.

The 24-year-old will now train with the Reds this week with a view to a potential debut against Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday.

Henderson said: 'I think everybody is looking forward to working with him.

'He is a very talented player and a very big player coming into the club. Hopefully he can give us a big lift and play some part in the next game.

Ominous: City were unstoppable on Monday, and Liverpool will need Balotelli to hit form straight away if the Reds are to challenge for the title 

'He was in the dressing room wishing everyone luck. It was good to see him. Hopefully he can get a good week's training under his belt and be ready for Sunday.'

Balotelli has been brought in to replace the departed Luis Suarez, whose absence was felt as last season's runners-up were ultimately well beaten by the champions.

The Reds  will look to bounce back from the City defeat when they face table-topping Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on Sunday.
