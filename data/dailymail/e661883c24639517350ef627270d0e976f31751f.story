Facebook portrait of Jade Stringer, 14, from Manchester, who was found hanged by her father David

A schoolgirl who was found hanged in 
her bedroom may have been driven to kill herself by bullies jealous of 
her popularity and good looks, it emerged yesterday.

Jade Stringer, 14, died six days after she was found unconscious by her father, David.

Friends say the teenager, who was well-liked and attractive, had endured a campaign of bullying over the past few months.

It is understood she may also have 
been upset at having her mobile phone confiscated by her family because 
they felt she was using it too much.

She was rushed to Fairfield General Hospital on June 10 where she died after almost a week on life support.

Friends of the teenager, who attended Haslingden High School, in nearby Rossendale, Lancashire, claimed she’d been bullied.

Tributes to Jade left on Twitter and Facebook said she had been a victim of bullying.

One pupil wrote: 'She was being bullied by numerous people.'

Chelsea Lazaruik added: 'R.I.P jade 
stringer you didn’t deserve to die the way you did bullying is horrible 
your was gorgeous in everyway.. Sleep tight xxx.'

Vanessa Nuttall said: 'Why anyone feels the need to bully someone so much is absolutely disgusting.'

It has also been reported she had 
clashed with her father after her mobile phone was taken off her.

Police said they were not treating her death as suspicious but were 'reviewing the circumstances' leading up to the incident.

Jade, who has a brother Jack, 13, was discovered in the attic bedroom of the home in Bury by her father nine days ago.

She was put on a life-support machine at Fairfield General Hospital in Bury where she died on Saturday afternoon.

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman 
said: 'Shortly after 3.35pm on Sunday, 10 June, police were called by 
paramedics to attend a house in Bolton Road in Hawkshaw, Edenfield, 
following a report a 14-year-old girl had been found unconscious.

'The incident is not being treated as suspicious and we are not searching for anybody else in relation to the incident.

'However, police are reviewing the circumstances leading up to this incident.'

The latest Ofsted report found Haslingden High to be an ‘outstanding school’.

The report added: ‘Surveys of students’ and parents’ opinions continue to support the view that “the control of bullying” is one of the school’s strongest features.’
