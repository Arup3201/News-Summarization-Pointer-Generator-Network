Sales of luxury cars have boomed in the first half of this year in signs that the economic recovery is picking up pace.

There were 943 Bentleys registered in the first six months of 2014, compared with just 692 during the same period last year, according to figures from the Department for Transport.

Sales of Maseratis almost doubled from 337 during 2013 to 624 this year, while Rolls-Royce also saw an increase in models sold, from 196 to 260.

Brands such as Bentley, Maserati, Jaguar, Porsche and Rolls-Royce have all seen sales figures jump at the start of this year as the economic recovery takes hold

Figures released by the Government yesterday showed that in the first six months of this year, Maserati sold almost twice as many cars as in the whole of last year

According to The Telegraph, other high-end car brands, such as Porsche and Jaguar also saw figures increase by up to 20 per cent year-on-year.

Speaking to Mail Online, Paul Watters of the AA said: 'There has been pent-up demand.

'To an extent luxury cars are a recession-proof item, but I think the recovery is now allowing more people to buy them who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford it.

'In fact, a quarter of AA members say they are planning to buy a new car in the next 12 months, which seems to stack up that hypothesis.' 

The figures also showed that there were a record 35million registered vehicles on Britain's roads at the end of 2013, including 29million cars.

The South West was the most crowded area in terms of car ownership, with more than 1 in 2 people owning a vehicle, while the majority of Londoners made do without, with only 1 in 3 people in the capital owning one.

In further signs that the economy is on the right track, sales of vans also increased sharply, with 77,000 being registered between April and June, an increase of 18 per cent on last year. 

Mr Watters added that and increase in home deliveries, driven by the rapid growth of online shopping, was likely to be behind this increase.
