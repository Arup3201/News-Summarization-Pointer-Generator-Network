Geri Halliwell and other celebrities poured more than £68million into a controversial fund accused of tax avoidance

Celebrities including the Beckhams, Robbie Williams and Geri Halliwell are among investors who poured more than £68million into a controversial fund accused of tax avoidance.

The 141 stars and other members of the super-rich could have jointly saved £26million in tax in just one year alone through the film investment scheme.

But many now face huge backdated bills as HM Revenue & Customs fights a legal battle to prove the venture was designed to avoid tax. Former Take That singer Mr Williams was the biggest individual investor in the Inside Track Productions scheme in 2002-03, according to a leaked list of those involved obtained by The Sunday Times.

His £2million stake meant he could have reduced his tax bill by the same amount by offsetting his other income against losses made through the investment. Investors were also entitled to a percentage of any films’ profits. David and Victoria Beckham could have jointly secured a tax break of £1million by sinking money into Inside Track, whose biggest success was the Oscar-nominated Vera Drake in 2004.

TV presenters Ant and Dec also invested and could have saved £100,000 each, while Anne Robinson and Jeremy Paxman were entitled to £50,000.

Former Spice Girls Geri Halliwell and Melanie Chisholm took part, too, allowing them to reduce their tax liabilities by £800,000 and £100,000 respectively. Yesterday, a spokesman for Miss Chisholm said the singer had contacted HMRC ‘in light of recent concerns’ and settled ‘all outstanding claims’.

It is not known if any of the investors claimed the tax breaks – and there is no suggestion they realised the fund could be viewed as a tax-avoidance scheme.

Inside Track Productions was set up by Ingenious Media in 2002 after the then Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced a policy designed to encourage investment in the British film industry.

Investment company Ingenious, is now at the centre of a legal battle with the HMRC. Investors include the Beckhams, left, and Robbie Williams 

But HMRC claims that the scheme was created as a way of generating tax relief for investors. A tax tribunal is hearing the case and is due to make its judgment later this year.

Ingenious, whose credits include Avatar, Life Of Pi and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, insists its film investments were legitimate commercial ventures. 

In a statement it said the Government had changed its position in a ‘rather crude attempt to generate cash for the exchequer in a wholly unfair and unjust manner’. 

‘The tribunal is ongoing. Ingenious remains confident of the outcome,’ it added.

Former England captain Steven Gerrard was entitled to a tax break of £386,585 after investing with the firm

Accounts show Davina McCall invested with the firm, meaning she was entitled to a tax break of £150,000

The case comes as HMRC launches a crackdown on tax-avoidance schemes. It is aiming to claw back £7.1billion from 43,000 people, it announced at the weekend.

A spokesman for the Beckhams said yesterday: ‘As we have said on many occasions, the Beckhams have always paid their taxes in full and have never been involved in aggressive tax-avoidance schemes.’

None of the other stars was available for comment.
