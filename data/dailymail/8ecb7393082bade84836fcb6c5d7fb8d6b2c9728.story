Drivers in Paris will only be allowed to use their cars every other day from tomorrow because of dangerous pollution levels.

The introduction of the drastic measure follows a grey smog settling over the French capital from the middle of last week.

Francois Hollande's socialist government decided to introduce alternative driving days after air pollution exceeded safe levels for five days running.

The Eiffel Tower, is barely seen through the smog from Paris. Emissions from the French capital could be blown over by strong south easterly winds until Friday, according to the Met Office

Now up to 700 traffic policemen will be drafted into the city to make sure the severe restrictions are enforced.

They will allow only vehicles with number plates ending in an uneven digit to take to the roads, beginning at 5.30am on Monday.

Motorcycles will also be covered by the ban, and anybody caught flouting them will face heavy fines.

Last Friday, public transport was made free of charge in Paris for four days in an attempt to encourage people to leave their cars at home.

Pollution levels have reached 180 microgrammes of PM10 particulates per cubic metre, more than double the safe limit of 80

Francois Hollande's socialist government recently decided to introduce alternative driving days after air pollution in Paris exceeded safe levels for five days running

Pollution is believed to be lingering because of a combination of bright sunny days and cold nights, say experts.

Environmentalists fear air pollution is currently rivalling notoriously dirty cities such as the Chinese capital, Beijing, and Mexico City.

Pollution levels have reached 180 microgrammes of PM10 particulates per cubic metre, more than double the safe limit of 80. PM10 particulates are emitted by heating systems and heavy industry, as well as by vehicles.

A spokesman for France's transport ministry said: 'Pollution levels will be monitored throughout the week to see if the driving restrictions will continue.'

Foreigners driving through Paris, including many Britons, will not be prevented from using their cars.
