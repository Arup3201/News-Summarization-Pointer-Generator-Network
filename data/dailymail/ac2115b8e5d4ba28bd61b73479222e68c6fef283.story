Tottenham are continuing talks with Villarreal over £20million-rated defender Mateo Musacchio.

The tough Argentine defender has impressed a lot of scouts in recent years. He is not the tallest but reads the game well and has all the hallmarks of former Argentina captain Daniel Passarella.

He is well known to Spurs boss Maurico Pochettino who is looking to toughen up his defence and has already shown he is willing to listen to offers for Michael Dawson while doubts remain over Younes Kaboul.

Wanted: Tottenham are closing in on a deal for Mateo Musacchio who is rated at £20million

Although there has been no confirmation of an official bid, Villarreal coach Marcelino said: 'It's a situation with three parties: the player, the buyer and the club in the middle.

'As I have said many times, if the club sell an important player it's because the right conditions to do so have been met.

'It won't be easy to replace him but the solution, for better or worse, will be found soon.'
