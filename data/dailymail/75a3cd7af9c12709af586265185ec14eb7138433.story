A high-stress job which left her 'burning the candle at both ends', combined with her mum falling very ill were the triggers that forced Irena Macri to take a step back and reexamine her life.

She quit her high-paying job in the corporate world and through her mum's battle with cancer began to reevaluate her own health and wellbeing.

'Mum was sick in 2009. She had colon cancer and then got diagnosed with thyroid cancer soon after,' Irena told Daily Mail Australia, adding that the diagnosis was a shock as her mother had always been very healthy.

Irena, here with her mum Tamara in 2007, started researching the 'lifestyle' after she quit her high-stress job and her mother fell ill

'She is now in remission but had to undergo surgeries for both,' she continued.

'For us as a family it was scary of course but we all stayed as positive as we could and mum was determined to not let the illness affect her love of life.'

Through her own research Irena experimented with various trends and diets before discovering the Paleo lifestyle in 2011.

'Paleo is a diet and I guess it’s a lifestyle, it is inspired by our hunter gatherer ancestors.

'We just take cues from the way our ancestors lived and look at what we as humans have thrived on,' Irena explained.

The paleo diet excludes refined sugars and grains, plus dairy, legumes, and anything processed

Irena insists the approach is just as much lifestyle-based as it is about changing what you eat

Now just a few years on she runs her wildly successful blog Eat Drink Paleo which has over 170,000 readers a month, and has just released a cookbook of the same name.

'It excludes refined sugar and grains, anything that comes in a package and has ingredients you can’t pronounce,' Irena said. 

Dairy, legumes and any processed foods are also banned on the Paleo diet.

But she insisted the approach is more lifestyle based than simply changing one's diet, and the focus lies in many aspects of a person's health.

'There’s the lifestyle aspect of paleo which doesn't get talking about as much, people that follow the paleo/primal lifestyle are really focused on improving sleep, reducing stress and stress management,' Irena said

'(It's about) getting outdoors and getting in touch with our more primal activities,' she added.

'It’s probably more important than the food to be honest, if people didn't even follow the diet but made improvements in the lifestyle aspects it would have a huge impact.'

Irena's mother is now in her late sixties but 'keeps a very active lifestyle' and 'has a big garden where she grows vegetables and fruit and tries to eat nourishing food.'  

The author explained that her relationship with food can be traced back to her family life in Ukraine, where she grew up and lived until she was 16.

'I have very fond memories of my childhood and everyone in the family was a big fan of cooking,' Irena recalled.

She said she remembers harvesting her own food and berries, and everything was made fresh as there were no fast food options.

'The cooking was kind of the centre of socialising with my family,' Irena said.

'When I look back I would consider what we ate as very nutrient dense I just didn't know it at the time.

'My parents were quite active, my dad was an athlete and my mum was a swimmer, both competitively.

'We spent a lot of time outside, I think I had a really good foundation,' she added.

With her Paleo lifestyle Irena encourages people to take an 80/20 approach to 'sustain the lifestyle and a little treat every now and then'.

'When it comes to eating well my approach is that 80 percent of the time I eat a very clean Paleo diet,' she explained.

She said moderation and variety is the key, so people don't get too 'obsessed with things'

'The 20 percent is for the things I add into my diet like a little bit of white rice or dairy', Irena said before adding that the additions could be different for every person.

'Moderation and variety is the key, we just tend to get a little bit obsessed with things.'

From a health perspective Irena believes the Paleo lifestyle has reduced her stress levels, increased her energy levels, improved her immune systems and helped her deal with a whole host of chronic illnesses as simple as cold and flus.

And with a global following of 87,000 people it seems that others are experiencing the same positive results.

What started as a resource for others to find Paelo recipes and support - something Irena struggled to discover when she initially started the blog - is now a full-time lifestyle for her.

'It has completely changed my life, I still pinch myself everyday,' Irena revealed.

'I work everyday, it’s a passion but its also a job.'

She cooks in her London home, and creates and photographs all her own food.

'I have a very small kitchen for someone who writes about food,' Irena joked.

Although she has a few gadgets she can't live without such as a food processor and blender, 'I have one frying pan, it’s all very basic'.

Eat Drink Paleo was originally self-published as an e-book but with a little help from crowd-funding meant she could produce a higher quality end product.

It has since been published in its latest form by Penguin Books Australia and is available from Booktopia or Bookworld RRP $34.99.
