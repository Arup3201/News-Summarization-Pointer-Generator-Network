Grief-stricken: Rachel Uchitel hunted for news of her fiance Andy O'Grady days after the 9/11 attacks

The top name in Tiger Woods' den of 
mistresses is fuming over claims she said she'd be a 'fat housewife with
 three kids' had her fiancé not be killed in the 9/11 attacks.

As the nation prepares to mark the 
tenth anniversary of the terror atrocity, Rachel Uchitel, allegedly told the New York Post’s Page Six magazine that dying on 9/11 was part of Andy O'Grady's destiny.

But she says the quotes had been reported out of context.

She said: 'I believe Andy was meant to die because he was too good. I'm almost happy it ended the way it did because I've learned so many lessons from him.

'It would have been tragic if we got into fights and then divorced.'

In addition, Miss Uchitel was quoted as 
saying her life would be drastically different had her fiancé survived.

She said: 'I would be a fat housewife with three kids in Sands Point, [Long Island].'

On Tuesday, Miss Uchitel hit back on her Twitter page, claiming her remarks were taken out of context.

She accused the newspaper of 'molding words and shaping how readers 
perceive people. This should be stopped'

In addition, Miss Uchitel told TMZ: 'I 
would have loved nothing more than to be Andy's housewife.'

When reached by MailOnline, the New York Post said: 'We stand by our story.'

Mr O’Grady, an investment banker who had proposed to Miss Uchitel months before, was working in the south tower on the morning of  September 11.

Days after the attacks, pictures of Miss Uchitel sobbing while clutching a photo of her missing fiancé became one of the most heart-wrenching images of the tragedy.

But in 2009, her face was splashed across the American media for a different reason, as she was revealed to be one of the women associated with Tiger Woods’ cheating scandal.

Miss Uchitel, 36, initially denied the allegations but came clean as more than a dozen other women came forward with their stories of infidelities with the world-famous golfer.

Eleven years ago, she met Mr O'Grady on a blind date. He proposed a few months later, in the summer of 2001.

In an interview with the Mail on Sunday last year, Miss Uchitel said she and Mr O'Grady 'were madly in love and I was the happiest girl in the world'.

'In Andy I had found my rock, a stable male figure that I’d never had… then 9/11 happened.'

She said she left for work early on that morning and didn’t kiss him goodbye because she didn’t want to mess up her lipstick.

She said: 'It’s something that haunts me.'

Confronting her fears: in the finale of Celebrity Rehab, Rachel Uchitel returned to ground zero and spoke to others who lost loved ones on 9/11

Eyewitness accounts from Andy O'Grady, who was working in the second tower to be hit, helped Miss Uchitel to report the early stages of the 9/11 attacks

Miss Uchitel bared her struggles with
 addiction after O’Grady’s death when she appeared on VH1's Celebrity 
Rehab with Dr Drew last year.

In
 the show's finale, she returned to ground zero and spoke to others who 
lost loved ones in the tragedy, before throwing a letter to Mr O'Grady 
into a Central Park lake, near where he proposed.

She said of her Celebrity Rehab experience: 'Doing this show… was one of the best decisions I've ever made.

'It has given me an opportunity to deal with some major trauma I've held onto for years.'

Reached
 by the Post after the Woods affair grabbed headlines around the world, 
O'Grady's father James said Miss Uchitel is not the same person she was 
when his son was engaged to her.

James
 O'Grady said: 'She wasn’t trying to be in the papers [back then]. Maybe
 9/11 had an impact on her and this is how she’s dealing with that.'

Miss
 Uchitel is now planning a move from New York City to San Francisco with
 her much younger current boyfriend, 26-year-old insurance underwriter 
Matt Hahn.

She said of her beau: 'He’s not a famous person. I find him to be grounded and I’m totally going to marry him.'
