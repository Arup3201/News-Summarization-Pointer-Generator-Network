The mother of a tragic girl who died in Crete two years ago has hit out at the Greek authorities after her daughter was called as a witness at the trial over her death.

Grieving Heather Hyndman, 47, from Castleford, West Yorkshire, said she had faced 'a wall of silence' from Greek authorities since her 20-year-old daughter Chelsea's death in 2010.

The enormous blunder was the first time she had heard from them about the trial, she claimed.

Miss Hyndman's boyfriend Luke Walker, 24, from Brierly Hill, West Midlands, is charged with causing her death by actual bodily harm. His trial will begin on October 16.

Mrs Hyndman said: 'The Greek court said it was nothing to do with me because I’m not a witness. It’s my daughter, how can it be nothing to do with me?'

'The Greek police haven’t spoken to me once.'

Mrs Hyndman also accused the Greek and British authorities of failing to support her.

She said: 'The Foreign Office has just given us a list of English-speaking lawyers. We wrote to our MP Yvette Cooper, but she said she was unable to help and sent us a list of phone numbers. We’ve been told someone will meet us on  the first day of the trial but then we’re on our own.'

The family’s liaison officer is also not allowed to attend an overseas trial so they will have to hire a solicitor to interpret.

Miss Hyndman had gone to work as a waitress and Mr Walker a barman in Malia, Crete, a resort famous for late-night parties and heavy drinking sessions.

The fun-loving girl was admitted to hospital in Heraklion - the island's largest city - suffering from severe abdominal pain.

She was transferred to another hospital for an emergency operation but died of ruptured internal organs, which Greek prosecutors allege were caused by beating.

Mr Walker was initially charged with murder but it was downgraded.

He denies causing Miss Hyndman’s death, claiming her injuries were caused in a fall.

He was released on bail in October 2010 on the condition he remains in Crete.

Mrs Hyndman, who plans to fly to Malia with her partner, Neil Lorriman, and their family, said: 'I’ve always said I’ll go with the evidence but there are so many unanswered questions. I just hope we can get some answers.'

'Some days are worse than others, like when it was her birthday last week.'

'I’ve got my other daughter Mia, who’s eight, so I’m lucky I’ve got her to wake up for. Sometimes I don’t think it’s real and she’s just going to walk through the door. We miss her.'

'I’m dreading going to court, I’m just glad my family can be with me.'
