An Arkansas teacher is under fire for bringing her infant baby to class and even breastfeeding it while students study.

The unnamed teacher in Poyen, population 290, has been bringing the baby to her rural high school on and off for weeks, students say.

And while some tolerate the baby's presence, others say its crying--not to mention its frequent and unmistakable need to feed--have become a nuisance.

Firestorm? An Arkansas teacher is under fire for bringing her infant baby to class and even breastfeeding it while students study

'It's a distraction, especially since we have a bunch of teenage boys in there,' one student, who gave her name to KARK only as Sally. 'Especially since we have a bunch of teenage boys in there.'

The teacher started bringing the baby to work on and off after she returned from maternity leave to the school of around 250 students.

One of the students snapped a photo of the teacher breastfeeding the baby under a blanket and posted it to Facebook.

A student also recorded video of the classroom, in which she says the cries of a baby can be heard, reports KARK. 

The student said the baby is a constant disruption to the class.

Appalling? Some students at tiny Poyen High are appalled, but others say the baby--and its feeding habits--is not a distraction

Word spreads: Poyen in rural Arkansas has a population of just 290

But others disagree.

One student who did give his name says the baby may as well not even be there.

'The baby just lays back there and plays with its toys, every now and then it may cry, but she goes back there and takes care of it,' said Tyler Rhodes.

Another student, Chase Rhodes, agreed and told KARK: 'I mean it's a cute baby and I don't think it's a distraction at all.' 

The school principal told KARK that teachers are permitted to bring their children to class only in emergency situations.

He declined further comment, calling the situation a 'personnel issue.'
