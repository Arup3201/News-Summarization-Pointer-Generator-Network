Actor Randy Quaid has unleashed a graphic attack on Rupert Murdoch who 'still hasn't thanked' him for starring in the 1996 movie Independence Day. 

In an explicit video, Quaid's wife Evgina sits on the bed in a bikini while the 64-year-old actor, who is sporting a long white beard, launches a diatribe against Warner Bros and News Corp.

It concludes with former model Evi donning a Rupert Murdoch mask before Quaid simulates sex with her while she wears a Murdoch mask. 

Meltdown: Randy and Evgina Quaid, who are currently suing John Kerry and believe a Hollywood sect wants them dead, have posted a bizarre video on YouTube attacking various media corporations

'You wanna f*** me Rupert? Well, I'm gonna f*** you. Evi, put this on,' Quaid says to the camera before performing the graphic act.   

The two-minute YouTube clip is the latest in a series of outbursts from the pair, who have openly expressed their belief that an evil Hollywood sect named 'Star Whackers' wants to kill them.

Quaid, who has a star on the Hollywood walk of fame, is the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid and is slated to reprise his role in the next Independence Day movie. It would be his first role in at least five years.

Currently, he and his wife are suing US Secretary of State John Kerry to recover their passports which were revoked three years ago after they failed to appear in court for charges of vandalism, fleeing to Canada instead.

The couple's controversies started in 2008, when Quaid was banned from the Actor's Equity union for life and fined $81,572 after a stage production of Lone Star Love in Seattle.  

According to statements filed by the cast and crew, Quaid's physically and verbally abused his fellow performers, forcing the show to close.

Four members of the union then filed restraining orders against Evi, Quaid's wife of 25 years, after an altercation the next day.

In 2010, the Quaids were arrested and charged with vandalism and residential burglary - both felonies - after being found living illegally in the guest house of a Montecito, California property they once owned.

They had allegedly caused thousands of dollars of damage, including breaking a $7,000 mirror and replacing it with a photograph of themselves.

The couple claimed 'they had owned the property since the 1990s' but were arrested and given court dates.

However, the pair jumped bail, skipped court, and relocated north of the U.S. border.

In Quaid's new video, uploaded to YouTube last Thursday, he tells viewers he 'helped media giants News Corp and Warner Bros Entertainment earn well over a billion dollars for the films Independence Day and Christmas Vacation'.

But, he says, 'Evi and I have been put through a living hell. A living hell of biblical proportions.'

He accuses Warner Bros Entertainment of conspiring with news outlet TMZ and the police to have him and his wife arrested six times, adding: 'Hash tag PMC: Police Media Corruption.'

Also targeted is Warners Bros financial partner Bruce Berman, whom he accuses of stealing their house.

Troubles: Mr and Mrs Quaid are wanted in California for charges of vandalism and residential burglary brought in 2010 but the pair fled to Canada before their first trial, prompting the US to revoke their passports

Arrested: In 2008 he was expelled from the Actor's Equity union, in 2010 he and wife Evi were arrested

And News Corporation, headed by Rupert Murdoch, 'continues to smear me to high heaven with a pack of lies' in the New York Post, he said. 

Finally, in a bizarre conclusion, Quaid muses: 'So how do we retaliate? Well, I still have a few tricks too.'

He opens his blazer to show a Hawaiian shirt: 'This is the very same shirt that I wore in '94 when I saved the world [in Independence Day] - another act that Rupert Murdoch still hasn't thanked me for. 

'So Rupert, you wanna f*** me? I'm gonna f*** you. Evi, put this on.'

With Evi bent over the camera, Quaid stands behind and appears to have sex with her.

Laughing over her shoulder, Quaid shouts 'Together Rupert!' repeatedly before screaming his Independence Day catchphrase: 'I'M BAAACK!' 

$500,000 bench warrants are still in effect for the couple in Santa Barbara.

The Quaids told authorities that their friends including Heath Ledger and David Carradine had died under 'mysterious circumstances' and were in fact killed by the 'Star Whackers' sect. 

Quaid withdrew his refugee claim last summer and immigration authorities have since denied his resubmittal.

Randy Quaid is the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid. He is best-known for his roles in films such as National Lampoon's Vacation and Independence Day.

He won a Golden Globe award - which he brought to court during one of his appearances in the innkeeper case - for his depiction of President Lyndon Johnson in a TV movie in the late 1980s.

He was also nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar in 1973 for his role in The Last Detail.

Quaid has a 31-year-old daughter, Amanda Quaid, with his first wife, Ella Marie Jolly, whom he divorced in August 1989. He married Evi six weeks later and they have no children together.
