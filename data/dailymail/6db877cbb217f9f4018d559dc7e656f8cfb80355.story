Mo Farah suffered a slight scare before holding on to win the European 10,000m title from fellow Briton Andy Vernon.

Farah, whose fitness had been questioned before the race, seemed in control throughout the 25 laps, but was made to work hard in the final 400m before pulling away.

Vernon, who was sixth at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, produced an excellent display to take silver, passing Turkish athlete Ali Kaya on the line.

Emotional: Farah kisses the track as he adds yet another gold medal to his collection

In a fairly sedate race Farah never looked uncomfortable, but he never stretched the race, choosing to let other athletes set the pace.

The Briton hit the front for the first time with seven laps to go, but didn't start to pull away from the field until the final-lap bell.

Easy does it: Farah had allowed others to set the pace as he ran a gentle race until the final few laps

As Farah tried to accelerate on the final bend he was matched stride for stride by Kaya, but on the home straight Farah finally made sure of the victory, as Kaya fell away to allow Vernon in for silver.

The Olympic Champion, who missed the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, was visibly delighted as he crossed the line, and apologised to any fans he'd let down by being unable to compete in Scotland. 

'This meant a lot to me,' said Farah. 'Two weeks ago it was a doubt if i was going to compete it. IT wasn't easy. I wanted to run the Commonwealth Games but I couldn't so coming here to run the Europeans meant a lot to me.'

Two champions: Usain Bolt was on hand to congratulate Farah after his victory 

'I didn't want to let people down, for all the people who bought tickets I let them down. I couldn't be there because I was nowhere near my best shape.'

100m World Record holder Usain Bolt was in Zurich and congratulated Farah on his lap of honour.

It was a season's best time for Vernon, and while Farah merely met expectations, the silver medalist will be delighted with his performance. 

It completes a show of dominance for Great Britain in the event, with Jo Pavey taking gold in the Women's 10,000m on Tuesday night.
