A new ITV programme that appears to show members of the public being hypnotised has been branded a fraud by experts.

Contestants in You’re Back In the Room compete for cash prizes after being put in a trance by a hypnotist who claims to have ‘hacked’ into their minds.

Keith Barry is said to have implanted ideas into volunteers’ brains – convincing them, for example, that their pants will feel tight whenever they hear a bell, or that they should push their face into a cake every time they hear certain words.

But clinical hypnotherapists who treat conditions like anxiety claim the TV brainwashing is a nonsense – and could be exploiting ‘vulnerable’ people.

‘It is not true to say anyone can have their brain hacked,’ said qualified therapist Mark Powlett. ‘You absolutely can’t make people do things they don’t want to do.

‘People who are under hypnosis are put in a very relaxed state which makes them open to positive suggestion. But the last thing a show like this wants is people who are relaxed – as they wouldn’t be able to perform as required.’

Mr Powlett said contestants on the show, hosted by Phillip Schofield, were not under Barry’s ‘control’, but playing along willingly. 

‘The people on stage want to entertain, they what to be in front of people and they want to win money,’ he said.

Liz McElligott, chief executive of the National Hypnotherapy Society said: ‘The programme sounds sensationalist to me. It’s completely wrong to say you can make people do something they don’t want to do.

‘It would worry me if vulnerable people are playing along because they want to be on television.’

ITV selected contestants via auditions, and one who failed to get a place tweeted: ‘My conclusion is that they are looking for people who purposely carry on for the camera because it will make great TV.’

Barry, who is certified by the National Guild of Hypnotists, said: ‘There is obviously a huge difference between using hypnosis as a therapy and as entertainment.

‘All contestants were genuinely hypnotised. On many occasions they were throwing away their prize money – something they would never ordinarily do, unless of course they were hypnotised.’

ITV, which will air the four-part series from next Saturday, said; ‘Duty of care to the contestants was always of paramount importance.’

Producers also abided by the 1952 Hypnotism Act and Ofcom rules on showing the full hypnotism routine that may cause ‘adverse reactions’.
