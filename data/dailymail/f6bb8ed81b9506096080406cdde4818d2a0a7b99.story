A Miami woman faces up to 40 years in jail after being charged with an unthinkable crime – killing animals while performing sex acts for fetish videos.

Sara Zamora, 28, decapitated chickens, beat rabbits to death and more for sexual gratification, Miami-Dade Police claimed.

The sickening videos were filmed at the Homestead home of Adam Redford, 54, of Homestead, said cops. He declined comment when reached by MailOnline.

An arrest report cited by the Miami Herald details the horrors carried out by Zamora and others in a video called ‘SOS Barn.’

Zamora and other women were shown in the the video ‘torturing and killing a wide variety of animals, including chickens, rabbits and more for the sexual gratification of its viewers,’ said the report.

The mortifying video is part of a genre of pornography called ‘crush,’ according to the paper.

Fetish model: Zamora's stage name Gloria Shynez is listed on many websites saying she is available for fetish, nude or custom modeling

Zamora is said by police to have been groping a man’s genitals with her left hand while ‘repeatedly cutting a chicken’s neck using hedge clippers with her right’ in one video.

Other videos had her scantily clad while ‘hacking off the head of another screaming bird, or [beating] chickens to death with a wooden stick.’

She is also shown karate-chopping the necks of rabbits while they howled in pain, police said, adding that she admitted to killing them.

’I’m glad I didn’t have breakfast because I would have puked all over the place,’ the woman’s defense attorney told the paper after he viewed portions of the video in court. ‘It was disgusting.’

Redford was already on parole for a similar animal cruelty violation last year, he has yet to be charged in the heinous crimes.

The ship captain’s website boasts that he has ‘been a part of many video productions related to South Florida fishing.’

Zamora’s Model mayhem profile, in which she goes by Gloria Shynez, talks up her ‘Middle-Eastern look,’ which she says ‘distinguishes from many models.

‘I am so excited to see what fun, beautiful shots we create together!’

Other Florida listings for a Gloria Shynez appear on Tampa Foot Party, tickle fetish sites and on another site that claims she ‘is a hot model available for nude and fetish custom videos.’

Her rates are flexible and she is ‘extremely easy to work with,’ according to her Model Mayhem profile.

Zamora was was hit with eight felony counts of animal cruelty, each carries a maximum five year prison sentence if convicted.

She was already on parole for a litany of criminal charges including grant theft with a firearm, multiple counts of credit card fraud, holding a fake driver’s license and multiple drug possession counts, records showed.

The repeat offender had been in jail for the past month after violating the terms of her parole by failing a drug test, according to the paper. She was due to be set free and was arrested only hours before her scheduled release.
