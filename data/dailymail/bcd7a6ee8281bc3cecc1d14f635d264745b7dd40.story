Britain could be richer than America within 15 years if it presses ahead with economic reforms to boost growth, George Osborne said last night.

In a bullish assessment, the Chancellor said there was 'no reason why Britain cannot be the richest major economy in the world', provided it continues reforms to upgrade the country's skills base and creaking infrastructure.

Mr Osborne also laid out plans for a new fiscal rule that would prevent future governments going on a borrowing spree – and force them to start paying down Britain's debts.

Chancellor George Osborne used a speech to the Royal Economic Society at the Bank of England to claim the UK could overtake the US to become the most prosperous country in the world

The Chancellor said a string of new reforms would be needed after the election to boost growth.

He hinted at a fresh assault on the planning system, saying he wanted to go 'further' to make it easier to build new homes and infrastructure – including a new runway at one of London's airports.

And he said the number of youngsters going to university was still 'too low'.

But he hit out at 'pessimists' who claimed the Government's austerity programme would prevent a recovery.

'The problem for the pessimists is that the evidence and experience of the last few years increasingly don't support their claims,' he said.

'Instead, the case for optimism is strengthening. If we are willing to take on the vested interests and pursue the right policies with consistency and discipline then there are no limits to what Britain can achieve.'

The UK economy is now above its pre-crash peak after seven quarters of growth, which Mr Osborne hopes will continue over the next decade

The value of Britain's biggest companies tumbled by nearly £40billion last night as fears over the outlook for the global economy sent shockwaves around the world. 

Stock markets fell on both sides of the Atlantic – with the FTSE 100 index down 2.35 per cent or 153.74 to 6388.46 in London – after the World Bank slashed its forecasts for global growth. 

This reduced the value of Britain's blue-chip companies by £39.1billion. 

Kaushik Basu, chief economist at the World Bank, said the global economy had become far too dependent on growth in the US. 

He also warned that the UK would be one of the countries hit the hardest by prolonged stagnation in the eurozone. 

Mr Osborne added: 'We can become the most prosperous of any major economy by the 2030s, with that prosperity widely shared – an aim I believe is firmly within our grasp.'

Treasury sources suggested the target was to make the UK the wealthiest country in the G7 by GDP per head. The UK is currently joint fifth, far behind the United States.

In a speech to the Royal Economic Society in London, Mr Osborne said plummeting inflation, which fell to 0.5 per cent this week, was the 'latest challenge' for the economy.

But he said it was driven by falling oil prices, which households should 'celebrate'.

He added: 'We should not confuse this welcome news for Britain's households as a result of falling oil prices with the threat of damaging deflation that we see in the eurozone.'

However, the Tory Chancellor's remarks drew a stinging response from his coalition partners.

A Lib Dem spokesman said: 'Osborne's plans are unfair in two very important aspects. Like us, they are planning to balance the books by 2017-18. But they will do that solely by cuts that will hit the working age poor. That is totally unfair.

'In contrast, we will balance the books by a mixture of spending cuts and some taxes on the better off. Once the books are balanced the Tory plan to run a surplus means they will embark on years of cuts to our public services.

'That will damage public services and damage the life chances of those who depend on them. There should be light at the end of the tunnel once the deficit is eliminated. Osborne's plans confirm the Tory's want to turn that light off. Life under a Tory majority government will be grim indeed for all but the best off.'
