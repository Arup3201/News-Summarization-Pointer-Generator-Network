Sergeant Jim Suter encourages his officers to catch up on their paperwork using laptops in coffee shops around the community

Years of hard work are finally paying off for dedicated police officer Jim Suter - who is celebrating the first crime free day in 25 years on the same beat.

Sergeant Suter has tirelessly worked to reduce crime in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, since 1988.

His days are normally spent dealing with burglaries, muggings, robberies, car theft, vandalism and drunken fighting.

But a string of initiatives have seen crime fall - and earlier this week not a single incident was reported in a 24-hour period for the first time on record.

Sgt Suter said from 6.30am on Monday to 6.30am on Tuesday this week, nobody in a town of more than 30,000 people reported a crime.

Not even a single domestic incident was recorded - which is normally a daily occurrence.

Sgt Suter said nobody even had a bike stole and there was not a single complaint of shoplifting.

The town will typically see about 10 crimes a day.

He said: 'I was really surprised. I certainly have never known that to happen before and I first started here 26 years ago.

'Twenty years ago, Trowbridge was horrendous. You couldn't walk from the station to the town centre on a Saturday night without immediately getting involved in some kind of incident.

'There are things we are doing that are having an impact, though, and our emphasis on being out and about in the town and visible as much as we can has certainly had a positive impact.

'We are also better at targeting repeat offenders as it is true to say that there's only a small number of individuals responsible for the large majority of crime in Trowbridge.'

This week was the first time in 25 years Trowbridge Police went 24 hours without any crimes reported

But the crime-free days for Trowbridge did not last longer than around 30 hours.

By lunchtime on Tuesday, a domestic violence offence, a theft and a burglary had been reported.

Sgt Suter pointed to Trowbridge Neighbourhood Police Team's increased use of bikes to increase their visibility on patch, which has helped reduce crime.

Officers are also now doing admin work in public thanks to 3G and wifi enabled laptops, giving them more time on the beat.

Jim said: 'To not have any reported crime at all is incredibly unusual and it is obviously a bit of an anomaly.

'I've not completely wiped out all crime from Trowbridge forever.

'If it was just one thing that I could put my finger on then I would replicate it, but it's not as easy as that.'

A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'The comments made by Sergeant Jim Suter related to a period when no live crimes were reported in the Trowbridge and Bradford-On-Avon areas.

'Clearly, officers would have still been investigating crime reported before this period and going about their daily patrols during this time.

The Wiltshire town, with a population of 30,000, normally has about 10 crimes reported each day

'The Trowbridge Neighbourhood Policing Team has increased its visibility over the past few months which has resulted in a drop in reported crime.

'We would always urge anyone wishing to report a crime to do so by calling Wiltshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where information can be left anonymously.'

Trowbridge police are making a strong push to ensure police officers are constantly seen by possible offenders by ensuring they are using bikes and doing paperwork on the go.

Sgt Suter said: 'We're also out and about a lot more. We're leading the way with things like getting police back on bicycles - we can do 2,000 miles in a month on the bikes - and more and more foot patrols.

'I'm also very keen that when my officers have paperwork to do, it's done on laptops now so they can go and do it in a coffee shop in town, or at a community centre.

'They are working doing admin, but they are visible.'
