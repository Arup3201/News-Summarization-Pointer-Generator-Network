Ministers have been criticised for writing off opponents of a controversial high-speed rail route as Nimbys and Luddites.

The rebuke came from the Transport Select Committee, even as it gave broad support for the £34billion HS2 project.

Yesterday the committee said the route would be ‘a catalyst for economic benefits’ and added that there was a ‘good case’ for expansion beyond Birmingham to the North and Scotland.

But it also urged supporters of the scheme to stop ridiculing their opponents as wealthy, selfish homeowners who care more about their lawns than the fate of the economy – and warned that there could indeed be ‘a substantial negative impact on the countryside’. 

HS2, which would run through areas of outstanding natural beauty in the Chilterns and Warwickshire, faces bitter opposition from residents and councils.

Former transport secretary Philip Hammond frequently described HS2’s detractors as Nimbys and Luddites, and in June the ‘Yes to HS2’ campaign paid for posters on buses and trains which asked: ‘Their lawns or our jobs?’

The ‘No’ camp took a similarly catty approach, touring the country with an inflatable white elephant to illustrate their claim that the scheme is a waste of money.

With the Government due to make a decision on the route by the end of the year, the Transport Committee’s report chided: ‘What should have been a serious and factually-based debate about how best to address the transport, economic and environmental challenges of HS2 has too often been reduced to name-calling and caricature.

‘Luddites, Nimbys and white elephants fought out a battle of “jobs versus lawns”.’

It continued: ‘We urge the Government to desist from disparaging opponents of HS2 as Nimbys, and for both sides in the debate to show respect for each other and to focus on the facts.’

HS2 would see 250mph trains able to carry 1,100 passengers running from London to Birmingham by 2026, with further extensions ready by about 2032.

The Transport Committee  chairman, Labour MP Louise Ellman, said the network ‘would  provide a step change in the capacity, quality, reliability and frequency of rail services between our major cities’.

But she also accepted that HS2 could have ‘a substantial negative impact on the countryside, communities and people along the route’.

The committee report backed the plan in principle and stated that a high-speed line ‘offers potential economic and strategic benefits that a conventional line does not’.

These were said to include a ‘dramatic shift’ in connectivity between cities and access to Heathrow and continental Europe, as well as ‘time savings and crowding benefits’.

It added that plans for HS2 ‘must be accompanied by complementary regional and local strategies for transport, housing, skills and employment’.

However, the committee members ultimately admitted that ‘if a new line is to be built, it should be a high-speed line’.

‘Our judgment is that HS2 could indeed be the catalyst for economic benefits,’ they concluded.
