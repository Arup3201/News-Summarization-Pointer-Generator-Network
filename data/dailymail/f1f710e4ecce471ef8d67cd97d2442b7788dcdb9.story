Disgusting: Jesse Lee Perales, 29, has bee charged with killing his estranged wife in front of her four children

A 29-year-old man has been accused of breaking into the home of his estranged wife and shooting her dead in front of her four children as she tried to escape.

Jesse Lee Perales allegedly smashed down the front door of Krystal Flores Perales's Laguna Shores Rd home in Corpus Christi, Texas, about 10pm Sunday.

According to court documents, Perales threatened Krystal Flores Perales's sister with a gun, saying he would shoot her if she moved.

He then allegedly told his son 'that he was going to kill his mother, Krystal 
Perales, then himself'.

Gripped by fear, Krystal Flores Perales, 28, grabbed her children, ran outside and jumped over the fence into an adjacent lot to escape.

Perales allegedly followed her and shot her several times in the head at point blank range as her terrified children watched. He fled the scene.

Police said the young mother died from gunshot wounds at Christus Spohn Memorial Hospital later that night, Kiiii News reported.

Perales was reportedly the father of two of Krystal Flores Perales's four children and had filed for divorce in August last year.

Following an anonymous tip, Perales was found the next day hiding out in an apartment complex at Staples and Saratoga.

It is not clear what prompted the alleged attack, however Perales virtually admitted to a reporter he shot his wife over a custody issue, Kiii News reported.

When asked by 3News why he did it, Perales answered, 'Why do you want to know?'

The reporter then asked if the shooting was custody-related, to which Perales answered, 'So my kids grow up good, man...(expletive) their mom.' 

Perales is being held in the Nueces County Jail over the murder, with bond set at $1 million.

News of the fatal shooting has devastated friends and family, who said the single mom was doing a wonderful job juggling her responsibilities at home and studying at Southern Careers Institute.

Jadda Mentch last saw Krystal Friday afternoon when she was picking up 
her children from daycare.

'Very sad. Very sad and depressing. I feel sorry for the kids, but also for her. I mean she was young and no one needs their life taken away that young,' she told KRISTV.com.

'She was a nice person. I mean no one deserves to be shot or anything like that.'

Shocked neighbors told KZTV they saw police at the home the night before the attack. 

'We came home and there was a police car and we saw him come out a little later and it looked like he had taken a report,' an unidentified neighbor said.

Meanwhile, Claire Klassen Hobbs who didn't know the victim but was devastated by the story has launched a fundraiser on GoFundMe in a bid to support the suffering children.

'Four Babies are without thier mother, I cannot image the saddness. I'm hoping we can atleast lessen the burdon by helping with monitary donations (sic),' she wrote.

More than $3120 has been donated.

In a tragic twist, Kiii News reported Krystal Flores Perales, a Flour Bluff High School graduate, had reached out to the Women's Shelter of South Texas before she was gunned down.

'I have seen a lot on the victim and how she might have brought this on her self and actually question why this person thought he had the right to shoot this person in the head so many times,' spokeswoman Francis Wilson said.

The victim had reportedly taken several restraining orders out against her estranged husband.

Meanwhile, Perales is no stranger to the law.

Kiii News reported that in December, he was arrested for burglary of a home, but the charges were dropped after the victim would not cooperate.

In 2008, he was arrested for assault but the charges were dropped in 2009 after the court was unable to locate the victim.

'Our prosecutors have thousands of cases pending and sometimes we try to find those people, but if they move, change their contact information, it's very difficult to find them. Looks like that's what happened in this case,' District Attorney Mark Skurka said.
