Over $1 million in $100 bills stolen from a shipping container on a Swiss Air passenger flight may have been a JFK Airport inside job.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Tuesday that the money was gone when the plane landed in New York. Now they believe an insider at JFK is the culprit.

And they're administering lie detector tests to personnel to figure out whodunnit.

Heist: The FBI is investigating $1.2million in cash found missing from a Swiss Air Lines jet when it at JFK airport, pictured, in New York Monday

The shipment on flight 17 left Zurich Saturday, but by the time it reached its destination at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, $1.2 million of the $92 million aboard was gone.

The theft was discovered at the official count of the cash at its final destination in New Jersey.

At first, it was it unclear if the money was stolen in Switzerland or somewhere en route.

An investigation then uncovered a big hole had been punched in the crate, likely with a forklift.

The thief then turned the crate in such a way that the hole wouldn't be evident.

And to find out exactly who, a source for the New York Post says the FBI is administering lie detector tests to JFK personnel.

Previously, ABC News reported a forklift operator 'opened the sealed crate and noticed damage to one of the crates in the form of a puncture from a forklift. It was a hole large enough to put your arm in.'

However, the operator failed to report the hole because reportedly because such damage commonly occurs to the crates after years of use.

Meanwhile, a Swiss Air rep said the company didn't have 'any indication of a robbery of a Swiss aircraft.'

Officials have not disclosed who the money was meant for or why it was being sent.

No comment? Jim Margolin, spokesman for the FBI in New York, declined to provide further information. But the New York Post reports that the agency is performing lie detector tests on JFK employees

Investigators are now looking in to how 
many mechanics, crew members and airport personnel had access to 
the jet and whether any of them could feasibly have emptied the box and 
escaped unnoticed.

According to the US Treasury, $1 million in $100 bills is estimated to weigh just 22 pounds, meaning a thief could easily cart around the cash.

The largest cash heist in JFK Airport history happened on December 11, 1978, when an estimated $5 million was stolen at the Lufthansa Airlines terminal.

At the time it was also the largest cash theft to have been carried out on US soil and went on to be portrayed in the movie 'Goodfellas'.

It is not unusual for airlines to transport large sums of money - with a single flight sometimes carrying more than $1 billion.
