Israeli soldiers this morning killed two Palestinians suspected of the abduction and murder of three Israeli teens - the crisis that spiralled into a seven-week assault on Gaza.

Security forces had spent months hunting Marwan Kawasme and Amar Abu Aysha, militants in their 30s from the Hebron area, after naming them as the killers of the Israeli teens.

The killings came after Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, said yesterday we will this week ask the UN for an international resolution to end Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories.

Hebron residents said soldiers surrounded a house in the city before dawn. Then there were sounds of gunfire, they said. IDF spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner said Kawasme and Abu Aysha were killed in a firefight.

'We opened fire, they returned fire and they were killed in the exchange,' Lt-col Lerner said. 'We have visual confirmation for one. The second one, we have no visual confirmation, but the assumption is he was killed.'

Palestinian officials have not confirmed the men were killed.

The two men were affiliated with the Hamas militant group which runs Gaza, and a group leader praised their deed in August, though other top officials denied any advance knowledge.

Israeli forces began West Bank sweeps and rounded up hundreds of suspected Hamas members after the three teens, Jewish seminary students Eyal Yifrach, 19, and 16-year-olds Gilad Shaer and Naftali Fraenkel, went missing.

Their bodies were found in June near Hebron. After initially denying involvement in the killings, Hamas last month acknowledged responsibility.

The arrest of several hundred Palestinians in house-to-house raids across the West Bank stoked hostilities with Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, leading it to retaliate with rocket fire.

Israel launched an offensive on July 8. Gaza medical officials say 2,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed. Sixty-seven Israeli soldiers and six civilians in Israel were also killed.

The bloody offensive on Gaza has strengthened calls for the Palestinian government to join multilateral institutions including the International Criminal Court.

Joining the court could potentially open the door to war crimes charges against Israel, both for its military actions in Gaza and for ongoing construction of Jewish settlements on occupied lands.

Mr Abbas spoke yesterday in a lecture at Cooper Union college. He is set to speak before the UN General Assembly on Friday and is meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry today.

The recent Gaza war has weakened Mr Abbas domestically, with Hamas enjoying a surge of popularity among Palestinians for fighting Israel. He is under pressure at home to come up with a new political strategy after his repeated but failed attempts to establish a Palestinian state through U.S.-mediated negotiations with Israel.

Abbas adviser Nabil Abu Rdeneh has said the Palestinian leader would present a new strategy in a speech to the UN General Assembly on Friday. In recent weeks, Mr Abbas and his aides have hinted at the outlines.

Under the plan, Abbas would ask the UN Security Council to issue a binding resolution, with a specific date for ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. Captured by Israel in 1967, the territories were recognized by the UN General Assembly in 2012 as making up a state of Palestine.

In the event of a likely U.S. veto at the Security Council, Mr Abbas will seek membership in dozens of international institutions and agencies, including the International Criminal Court.

The U.S. has urged Abbas not to turn to the Security Council, but has not offered an alternative, said a Palestinian official.
