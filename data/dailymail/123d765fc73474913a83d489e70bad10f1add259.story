A fake business tycoon used photos of himself with Roman Abramovich, Jose Mourinho and Christiano Ronaldo to persuade football club shareholders to sell him their club for £1, according to court documents.

A legal battle has broken out between Outail Touzar, 31, and Salisbury City Football Club bosses after the Moroccan took over the financially struggling club in June this year.

After buying the club, he immediately made himself chairman and signed midfielder Prince Khalid Bin Bader Alsaud, 19, who became the first member of the Saudi royal family to play for a professional British team.

At the time, it was reported he was a successful businessman with links to wealthy oil-rich sheikhs.

However, The Sun reported Touzar convinced Salisbury shareholders to sell him the club for a nominal £1 fee - which he ultimately failed to pay - after showing them photos of himself with Chelsea FC owner Abramovich, manager Jose Mourinho, as well as footballing star Cristiano Ronaldo and Fifa president Sepp Blatter.

Salisbury chief executive Paul Smith said he thought the images of Touzar with the celebrities were faked.

He said: 'Everything he brought forward proved to be a total scam. It was a load of rubbish.'

The paper reported the club is now suing Touzar for damages and Touzar has not commented. MailOnline has requested comment from Touzar.

The club's fans were left baffled in June when they woke up to discover their club had been sold to Touzar in a secret overnight deal.

At the time, the club were in deep financial trouble and struggling to avoid closure.

Upon his appointment, Touzar said he was 'honoured' to take on the role of chairman of Salisbury City FC.

He said: 'After initial hesitation, deep thinking and consulting with my advisers I decided to accept the challenge of taking this lovely small town community club and build something special out of it.'

He went on to announce the 'first major squad addition' for his team.

He said: 'Prince Khalid Bin Bader Alsaud from Kingdom of Saudia Arabia agreed to play for us next season.

'A 19-year-old versatile midfielder, he will join us from Bromley FC and will become the first Arab and Saudi Royal to play professional football in history and what a better historic and special place for that to happen than Salisbury?'

Salisbury City FC released a statement yesterday confirming they were continuing to operate under administration following the latest court proceedings. The club is currently without a league to play in.
