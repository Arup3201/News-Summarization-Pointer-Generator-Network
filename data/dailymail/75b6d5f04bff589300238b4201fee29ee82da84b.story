An unlicensed  motorbike rider who deliberately ploughed into a cyclist because he told him off for riding on the cycle path is to be sent on a 'thinking skills' programme.

Sean Gregory, 19, admitted that he lost his temper when cyclist Paul Fielding stopped and remonstrated him for using his off-road vehicle on a cycle path.

But he told Manchester magistrates' court that that he had only driven towards him with the intention of scaring him and was in a bad mood because of an earlier row with his girlfriend.

Bad mood: Manchester magistrates' court heard Gregory claim that he had only driven towards the cyclist with the intention of scaring him

Mr Fielding was on his way home along the Fallowfield loop in south Manchester when he was hit and knocked off his bike the Manchester Evening News reports.

Tom Sweeney, prosecuting, said Gregory, 19, became aggressive and drove at Mr Fielding after being told off for riding on a foot and cycle path.

He suffered a cut knee and ripped leggins but fortunately suffered no serious injury.

Today Gregory, 19, who claimed to have an anger management problem, pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving and was sentenced to 18 weeks jail suspended for a year at Manchester magistrates court.

Chairman of the Bench Frank Hauxwell said: 'This could be considered as using your bike as a weapon. But we give you credit for your plea and remorse.'

Gregory of Gorton, Manchester was disqualified for 18 months and ordered to pay Mr Fielding £250 compensation and £85 costs and £80 surcharge.

He also admitted having no licence or insurance and will be forced to attend a thinking skills programme to address his anger issues.

Gina Clayton, defending, said: 'He had argued with his girlfriend earlier in the day. It put him in a bad mood but he didn’t mean to harm the cyclist.'

Gregory will have to take an extended test before he will be allowed to drive again.
