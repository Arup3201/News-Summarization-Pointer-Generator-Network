Nick Clegg became the incredible sulk of British politics yesterday by snubbing David Cameron’s triumphant appearance in the Commons.

The Prime Minister was cheered by Tory MPs for his historic veto of a new EU treaty at the Brussels summit.

His pro-EU deputy ducked yesterday’s session, telling Mr Cameron he would be a ‘distraction’ on the Government front bench.

Triumphant: David Cameron was in full flow yesterday as he explained his historic veto of a new EU treaty, saying he was right to 'defend Britain's national interest'

Instead, he took to the TV studios to accuse the Prime Minister of endangering the livelihoods of millions of Britons by risking isolation in Europe.

Mr Clegg is understood to be demanding that the UK begin a ‘process of building bridges and re-engagement’ in Brussels.

Pressed about the Deputy Prime Minister’s absence, Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘I’m not responsible for his whereabouts.’

Frantic behind-the-scenes talks were held throughout the day to try to paper over the cracks between the Tories and the Lib Dems following Mr Cameron’s refusal to sign up to an EU power grab supposed to save the euro.

Mr Cameron insisted he had been right to stick to his word and ‘defend Britain’s national interest’. He made clear he thinks EU leaders have got it wrong on the euro – but he went out of his way not to offend Lib Dems.

He told Tory Eurosceptics that Britain’s membership of the EU was not in question and that the issue of a referendum would not arise because no powers would pass from Westminster to Brussels.

Downing Street also apparently agreed to soften its position on stopping other states using the institutions of the 27-member EU – if they can forge a fiscal union. Mr Clegg has argued such a move would be ludicrous.

In the Commons, Mr Cameron insisted Mr Clegg had endorsed the strategy that he now appears to regret. ‘The negotiating approach was agreed by the Government before I went to Brussels,’ the Prime Minister said.

In what some took as a swipe at Mr Clegg, who initially backed Mr Cameron’s stance before howls of protest from senior Lib Dems, the Prime Minister added: ‘I did exactly what I said I was going to do. Apparently in politics these days, that’s very surprising.

Debate: Members filled the Commons benches yesterday afternoon to hear Mr Cameron's statement before many offered support from both sides of the House

‘Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have not always agreed about European integration but we have both set aside our interests to work in the national interest of having a government that is able to clear up the mess that Labour left.

‘Britain remains a full member of the European Union and the events of last week do nothing to change that. Our membership of the EU is vital to our national interest.’

But he added: ‘The balance of powers between Britain and Europe isn’t right and there are powers I would like to see returned.’

Mr Clegg said it did not matter who sat where in the Commons and added: ‘I would have been a distraction if I was there ... I have made my views clear about Britain’s isolation at the summit last week.

‘I have made it very clear that I think isolation in Europe, where we are one against 26, is potentially a bad thing for jobs, a bad thing for growth and a bad thing for the livelihoods of millions of people in this country.

‘When I was told the outcome of the 
summit, after it finished, I immediately told the Prime Minister that I 
could not welcome it, that I thought it was bad for Britain. I have 
stayed with that view since, and I have simply amplified on my reasons 
for that since the summit.’

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable, who was in the Commons, has also vowed to launch an offensive to keep Britain in Europe – saying the Government’s policy cannot be to ‘cut off its nose to spite its face’.

Conservative MPs lined up to applaud the Prime Minister’s stance. Sir Peter Tapsell expressed ‘admiration and full-hearted support at this definitive moment in his first premiership’.

Eurosceptic former Cabinet minister John Redwood said: ‘Britain has much more negotiating strength today, because Europe knows that it is dealing with a Prime Minister who will say “No” if he needs to.’ Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell praised Mr Cameron’s ‘bulldog spirit’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband however attacked Mr Cameron for what he called ‘the biggest mistake of Britain in Europe for a generation’.

Lib Dem Baroness Tonge said that a general election was needed to ‘clear the air’ between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. She criticised Mr Clegg’s failure to appear in the Commons, saying: ‘He should have been there and stuck it out frankly.

‘He is the deputy leader of that government. He should have been there.’

Nicolas Sarkozy said yesterday: ‘There are clearly two Europes. One that wants more solidarity among its members and more regulation. The other which is attached only to the logic of the single market.’

He added that he and German chancellor Angela Merkel had done everything they could to keep Britain on board – implying Mr Cameron did not want a deal.

Senior Lib Dems also in the Commons included Energy Secretary Chris Huhne and Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.
