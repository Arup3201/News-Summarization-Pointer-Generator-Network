A school today linked to the Trojan Horse scandal allegedly forced students to revise for exams in the street because staff did not want them speaking to inspectors.

Fears that classrooms are being taken over by hardline Muslims have spread to Bradford  as it emerged Ofsted is sending officials to the city to see if strict Islamic rules are being imposed.

Inspectors reportedly visited Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College yesterday, and will likely visit Carlton Bolling College, where boys and girls have allegedly been segregated in classes and senior staff and governors visited a Birmingham school now in special measures.

It emerged today that around 30 Year 11 pupils at Laisterdyke arrived for revision classes yesterday but were reportedly told they could not come in because Ofsted were inside.

'Turned away': Students at a Bradford school forced to revise outside when they were refused access to the school due to an Ofsted inspection

Claims: A councillor, and former governor at the school, said that the timetable said that they should have been allowed in but students said they had no choice but to sit outside

New claims: Students arrive at Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College in Bradford this morning, which was reportedly visited by officials yesterday

Bradford Councillor Faisal Khan, a former governor, said: 'I just went to drop something off for the Ofsted inspection which I wanted them to see, and I  noticed there were loads of students standing outside.  

A Trojan Horse-linked academy spent £50,000 on a taxpayer-funded trip to Saudi Arabia for students and staff - and handed the contract to a travel company with links to a director at the school.

Oldknow Academy was among five Birmingham schools rated as inadequate and placed in special measures by Ofsted on Monday, amid claims children were not being protected from extremism. 

Inspectors said young pupils had allegedly heard the phrase ‘white prostitute’ to describe Western women - and where the tombola was banned at a fete for being un-Islamic.

The Education Funding Agency (EFA) had raised financial concerns about two publicly-funded Muslim-only trips to Saudi Arabia in 2012 and 2013, the latter costing £47,200.

It was revealed today the contract for last year’s visit was handed to a Birmingham travel company, which has links to a current teacher and former director at the 600-pupil Small Heath school. 

The Agency investigation discovered the contract for the trips had never gone through a formal tender process.

Last May 40 students and eight staff travelled to Mecca and Medinah. The ten-day visit involved stays at luxury five-star hotels. 

The trip was booked and organised through Hilal Tours and Travel Ltd, run by Umar Zaman, 38. Its website tells potential clients to send deposits of £500 to an address in Burlington Road, Erdington.

Qamar Zaman, 43, was a director of Oldknow Educational Trust - which runs  Oldknow Academy - at the time the trips were booked and took place.He is currently working at Oldknow as an advanced skills teacher. 

Qamar Zaman was also listed as having lived at the Burlington Road address in 2007.  

He denied to the Birmingham Mail ever having links to Hilal Tours and Travel Ltd, and said an address listed on Companies House was not his. 

'They said they weren’t allowed in but they were supposed to be revising in study sessions - and the timetable they showed me indicated this also.

'It says in black and white that they should have been there, but they were turned away at the last minute because an Ofsted inspector was inside. 

'So they had no choice but to sit outside during the confusion.' 

The school’s senior vice-principal Richard McManus said today that parents of pupils sitting exams had been sent a letter including details of exam leave on Friday, and that it was made clear that although there were some revision sessions in the school, pupils were expected to study at home the rest of the time.

However, a study guide supplied by one of the pupils sat outside states several sessions had been organised, which they were expected to attend.

Inspectors are also believed to be planning an inspection at nearby Carlton Bolling College, which the BBC said has been accused of imposing a Muslim agenda on classrooms.

These include segregating boys and girls in some classes.  

It follows claims that the colleges have links to a governor accused of orchestrating the so-called Trojan Horse campaign to takeover schools in Birmingham. 

Tahir Alam, governor of Birmingham's Park View school, where inspectors reported girls being discouraged from speaking to boys, spoke at a Muslim education forum set up by a governor at Carlton 
Bolling and former governor at Laisterdyke, the Times reported today.

The paper reported the head teacher of Carlton Bolling also visited Park View school, which continues to insist the claims made against it are 'politically motivated'.

The new fears were raised as Ofsted 
head, Sir Michael Wilshaw, back-tracked on a suggestion that the 
Education Secretary had opposed his plans for inspectors to be allowed 
to make ‘no-notice’ visits to schools.

He
 had claimed that he proposed the reform when he was first appointed two
 years ago but that Mr Gove rejected it because it would be unpopular 
among headteachers.

Following an angry denial from the Education Secretary, Sir Michael issued a statement accepting that Mr Gove had a ‘long-standing’ commitment to the change.

A move to allow snap inspections and a
 requirement for all pupils to be taught about British values are two of
 the main responses to the shocking revelations of inquiries into the 
Trojan Horse campaign.

One 
school was said to have put on a hastily arranged show of ‘cultural 
inclusivity’, with a lesson on Christianity, because it knew inspectors 
were coming.

Despite winning his row with Sir 
Michael over inspections, Mr Gove is under pressure on a number of 
fronts in the wake of the scandal.

Retaliation: Education Secretary Michael Gove forced the head of Ofsted to take back his claim that he had rejected the idea of snap inspections two years ago

Nick
 Clegg insisted that academies and free schools should be obliged to 
teach from a core curriculum – which they currently do not have to do – 
to prevent any further campaigns to change schools’ ethos and character.

Mr Gove’s Conservative colleague, Baroness Warsi, distancing herself from his response to the Trojan Horse revelations, suggested he should ensure he did not ‘make matters worse’ by alienating Muslims.

She also rejected suggestions that there was a ‘conveyor belt’ between conservative Islam and violent Islamist extremism, a claim made by Mr Gove in a 2006 book.

‘I don’t think there is necessarily a link and I’ve yet to see a definitive piece of evidence which shows that religiosity in any religion equates terrorism,’ she said.

Despite speculation that he could be moved in a forthcoming Cabinet reshuffle.

Mr Gove was backed by David Cameron, who set out a list of ‘British values’ he wanted taught in all schools.

Professor Chris Husbands, director of the Institute of Education, said the idea of a set of values to prepare youngsters for lives as citizens was a good one, but he warned defining British values was much easier in the ‘abstract than in the detail’.

Mr Gove’s former aide Dominic Cummings has said the idea of teaching meaningful British values will get bogged down in legal challenges under human rights law.

He predicted that Number Ten would be demanding ‘some eye-catching gimmicks that DC [David Cameron] can wheel out on British values’.

Labour MPs pointed to Mr Gove’s attack on Gordon Brown’s attempts to draw up British values in 2007, when he declared: ‘There is something rather unBritish about seeking to define Britishness.’
