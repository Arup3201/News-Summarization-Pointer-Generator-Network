A 5-year-old girl from Texas was rushed to a hospital after getting locked inside a running washing machine at a Pasadena Laundromat for several minutes.

The bizarre incident took place at Le's Washateria in the 2400 block of Southmore Avenue around 6.15pm.

Police said the girl was trapped in the washing machine on high speed when a customer noticed her.

Put through the wringer: A 5-year-old girl had to be rescued after getting locked inside a washing machine at Le's Washateria in Pasadena,Texas

A woman had tried to use the machine at Le's Washateria and told a manager it was not working properly.

The customer then moved to another machine before the child became trapped. It is unclear how the 5-year-old got inside or how the machine turned on.

‘She was tumbling pretty fast in there,’ Vance Mitchell, of the Pasadena Police Department, told KHOU. ‘One person walked by and said they saw something flopping around in there. They thought it was just a dress or something because it was moving pretty fast.’

The child spent a few minutes tumbling on high speed before a customer noticed something flapping inside the machine and told an employee 

The Laundromat owner says an employee had to use circuit breakers to stop the machine before first responders arrived on the scene.

The girl was airlifted to Memorial Hermann Hospital for observation. Police say they do not believe she suffered life-threatening injuries.

There is no word at this time who, if anyone, was watching the child.
