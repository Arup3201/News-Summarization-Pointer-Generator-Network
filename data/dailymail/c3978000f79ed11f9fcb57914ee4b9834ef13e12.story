James Ford, 26, was high on drink and drugs when he swerved into the path of the car driven by John Miller, 81, fatally injuring him

A motorist who swerved into the path of a Vauxhall Corsa driven by an 81-year-old had drunk alcohol and taken cocaine and cannabis before he got behind the wheel, a court heard.

James Ford, 26, has been jailed for just four years and nine months after admitting causing retired policeman John Miller's death after he smashed into him in Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire.

The court heard how Ford, from Silverdale, seemed worried about getting points on his driving licence in the immediate aftermath of the smash which left fitness fanatic Mr Miller, 81, of Knutton, fatally injured.

Mr Miller, who played football for his local team until he was 70, died five days after the crash, which happened shortly after 11pm on 1 December 2012.

Ford left the Great National Hotel in Clayton, where he had been drinking with friends, and was driving round a bend in Milehouse Lane, Newcastle-under-Lyume when he lost control as he drove between 30-40mph and ploughed into Mr Miller.

Prosecutor David Bennett said: 'A 
taxi driver saw the Fiat travelling at some speed. It swerved and went 
on the wrong side of the road.

'There was a significant collision with the Corsa.

'The
 defendant got out and screamed in pain as he tried to walk. He seemed 
to show concern that he was going to lose his licence.

'Paramedics arrived and the defendant was given morphine.  Mr Miller was trapped and unconscious. The roof had to be cut away and he was taken to hospital.'

Ford, who spent six weeks in hospital recovering from his injuries, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving when unfit through drink or drugs and possession of cocaine.

The court heard Ford was just below the legal blood alcohol limit, and that his sample contained cocaine, cannabis, and morphine.  Ford was also found to have 0.21g of cocaine on him.

Simon Warlock, defending, said: 'This is a terrible example of what happens when drink and drugs are mixed together. 

'The defendant lost control at just the wrong moment.'

The
 court heard Ford had previous convictions for driving without due care 
and attention and failing to stop after an accident in 2006, as well as 
drink-driving in 2010.

Yesterday, Ford was jailed for four years and nine months and given a six-year driving ban at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court.

Judge
 Paul Glenn told him: 'John Miller’s life came to an untimely end because 
you chose to drive when you must have known you were in no proper fit 
state to do so. 

'You drove
 too quickly, having consumed drugs as well as alcohol. In the immediate
 aftermath your concerns were totally selfish. 

'You were unfit through a cocktail of two different types of controlled drugs which the law makes it illegal to possess.'

Today Mr Miller’s nephew, Kevan Miller, 54, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, said: 'This has had a devastating effect on the family.

'We have to suffer a life sentence and live with losing John in such a horrible way.  He was 81 but was fighting fit and had a lot of years left in him. He will be missed by a lot of people.'
