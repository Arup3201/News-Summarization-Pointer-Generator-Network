It’s been a while since we have seen this. Manchester United dominant and convincing, a result that never looked in doubt.

Yes, Newcastle had their moments early on. Yes, they had early opportunities and should have been awarded a penalty with the game goalless. But did Louis van Gaal’s improving United ever look as though they would do anything but win here at Old Trafford? No, not for a moment.

This was how it used to be under Sir Alex Ferguson. United were confident and sharp, assured in their passing and their execution of opportunities. They won with something in reserve, with modern day makeweights such as Darren Fletcher on the field as substitutes by the hour mark to spare the energy of the stellar names until their next appointment — at Tottenham — on Sunday afternoon.

That will be a tougher test. Tottenham cannot possibly defend as naively as Newcastle did here while United tend to be somewhat less convincing away from Manchester.

Nevertheless, there is definite progress to be seen in Van Gaal’s team. While the David Moyes version of last season enjoyed a decent run at this time of year and then slipped rather inevitably into terminal decline, Van Gaal’s United look rather like their best days this season may yet be ahead of them.

Certainly they were helped here by a Newcastle team that looked capable with the ball but inept without it. Unless Alan Pardew can improve his team defensively then the slump that followed the revival that followed the slump will continue indefinitely.

To focus on that, however, would not only be rather depressing for the terrific Newcastle fans but also rather unfair on a United team guided imperiously round the field by Wayne Rooney and laced with wonderful cameos from Juan Mata and Radamel Falcao and another excellent performance from the seemingly reborn Ashley Young.

If the mark of a manager — at least in part — is how well players improve and perform on his watch then Van Gaal is scoring highly at the moment. His team’s defensive security still needs work but with the ball they were terrific.

Certainly Newcastle could and perhaps should have been in front early in the piece.

For the first 15 minutes the lively Ayoze Perez was the game’s best player and he had already terrified United with one searing run from deep, and failed with a close-range volley, by the time the game’s first real talking point arrived in the 14th minute. Referee Mike Jones — who has his critics — was in a perfect position to see Mata clip the heels of Yoan Gouffran as the path of the two men crossed but either blinked at the wrong moment or deemed the clear contact unintentional.

Whatever the case, he didn’t give a penalty and United were free to take full advantage by moving in to the lead shortly afterwards.

Even early on, it seemed United would win. There was something about Newcastle’s defending that didn’t bode well from the start.

Every cross — many of which came from the left foot of Young — seemed to cause a problem and Robin van Persie and Falcao could have scored early had they connected with balls that seemed to evade Newcastle defenders rather unerringly. Eventually, in the 24th minute, a goal arrived and it was terrific.

Rooney — dictating play like a rugby scrum-half — fed Mata and when the Spaniard’s chipped pass reached Falcao, peeling off his marker at the back post, the first time cut-back was perfect for Rooney to score from six yards.

In that instant, it was hard not to feel Newcastle were already done for. There was something about United that suggested they wouldn’t be denied and shortly after Falcao failed to nudge in another Young cross they added their second goal.

This time it was a hospital pass from Gouffran to Perez that put Newcastle in trouble but it still took a determined tackle from Falcao to allow Mata to play Rooney clear in to the penalty area. The finish was applied first time.

From then on, it was perhaps a case of ‘how many’ and surprisingly United only managed three.

Eight minutes into the second half, Rooney’s lofted pass from 40 yards found a huge hole between Daryl Janmaat and Steven Taylor and Van Persie applied a headed finish back across goal that was actually a lot harder than it looked.

Before the end, Newcastle did get their penalty. Phil Jones clumsily upended Jack Colback and substitute Papiss Cisse converted high to David de Gea’s left.

This was not one of those afternoons that left De Gea as a spectator for long spells. United have some way to go before they take us that far back in time.

Nevertheless, this looked like United’s day from the get-go. To repeat, it’s been a while since we have seen this.
