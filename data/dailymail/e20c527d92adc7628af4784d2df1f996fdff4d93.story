Turkish riot police fought running battles with pockets of protesters overnight, clearing the central Istanbul square that has been the focus of nearly two weeks of protests against Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan.

By dawn, Taksim Square, strewn with wreckage from bulldozed barricades, was largely deserted and taxis crossed it for the first time since the troubles started.

Several hundred remained in an encampment of tents in Gezi Park abutting the square.

Erdogan, who has repeatedly dismissed
 the demonstrators as 'riff-raff', was expected to meet a grouping of 
public figures about the protests on Wednesday.

In
 the fighting talk that first endeared him to voters 10 years ago, he 
said on Tuesday he would not 'kneel' before the protesters and that 
'this Tayyip Erdogan won't change'.

Safak Pavey of the opposition CHP party said: 'This is the accumulation of 10 years of insulting people in every way.

'It was just the moment of city people who didn't want to live any more in concrete.

'Every kind of human rights violation has been done on them in that square... it has turned into a clash of cultures, I'm afraid.

'Getting rid of military rule and trusting democracy to the Islamists is like taking hold of a sharp knife.

'Confronted by this majoritarian bloc, every kind of minority... feels under threat.'

The
 United States, which has held up Erdogan's Turkey in the past as an 
example of Muslim democracy that could benefit other countries in the 
Middle East, expressed concern about events in Turkey and urged dialogue
 between government and protesters.

'We
 believe that Turkey's long-term stability, security and prosperity is 
best guaranteed by upholding the fundamental freedoms of expression, 
assembly and association, and a free independent media,' White House 
spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.

Erdogan,
 though, has increasingly accused foreign forces and international media
 and market speculators of stoking conflict and trying to undermine the 
economy of the only largely Muslim NATO state.

He
 has also exerted strong pressure on the media, seven newspapers last 
week carrying the identical headline citing Erdogan as saying he, not 
the protesters, guaranteed democracy.

The
 night had brought some of the worst clashes since the troubles began. 
Police fired tear gas into thousands of people gathered on the 
square,including people in office clothes who had gathered after work, 
some with families with children.

The
 crowd scattered into narrow streets around, leaving a hard core of 
protesters to return, lighting bonfires and stoning water cannon. Police
 then launched tear gas attacks again, the cycle repeating itself until 
numbers dwindled.

'We will 
continue our measures in an unremitting manner, whether day or night, 
until marginal elements are cleared and the square is open to the 
people,' Istanbul Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu declared on television on 
Tuesday night.

Police were 
less in evidence by the morning and it was not clear if protesters would
 return in the course of the day, as they have previously.

A
 fierce crackdown on initial protests against planned redevelopment of 
Gezi Park, a leafy corner of Taksim, triggered the wider protests, 
drawing in a broad alliance of secularists, nationalists, professional 
workers, unionists and students - some of whom would never before have 
considered sharing a political platform.

Erdogan
 argues that the broader mass of people are at best the unwitting tools 
of political extremists and terrorists and points to his 50 percent vote
 in the last of three successive electoral victories for his political 
authority.

Hs critics, some 
of whom who say conservative religious elements have won out over 
centrist reformers in his AK Party, accuse him an increasingly 
authoritarian conduct and of inflaming the crisis with unyielding talk.

Some
 charge that his politics are too often shaped by a religious agenda, 
with the introduction of alcohol restrictions and comments suggesting he
 favours a traditionalist role for women.

For
 his part, Erdogan has complained of the contempt he feels secularist 
leaders have shown in the past for religious sentiments, excluding women
 with head scarves from universities. He has accused protesters of 
attacking women in headscarves and of desecrating mosques by bringing in
 beer.

'There's no room for 
dialogue when there's ongoing violence,' said Mucella Yapici of the 
Taksim Solidarity Platform, a core group behind the Gezi Park campaign.

Gezi
 Park has been turned into a ramshackle settlement of tents by leftists,
 environmentalists, liberals, students and professionals who see a plan 
to develop one of the few green spaces in Istanbul as symptomatic of an 
overbearing government.

Erdogan
 swept to power in 2002 after forging his AK Party from an alliance of 
centrist reformers and nationalists as well as remnants of Islamist 
parties banned in the past by secular authorities. Denying any plans to 
subvert Turkey's secular order, he set about deep-reaching social 
reforms.

He broke the 
political power of an army that had toppled four governments over four 
decades, including Turkey's first Islamist-led government with which he 
was associated. He also opened talks with the European Union, introduced
 some social reforms and sought to negotiate and end to a long-running 
Kurdish rebellion.

What is 
notably absent during this crisis is the speculation of a military coup 
that has in the past accompanied social unrest - some tribute to 
Erdogan's reforms. Army power is broken. Nor though does there seem to 
be any political alternative to Erdogan who faces a weak opposition in 
parliament and fragmented groups on the streets.

'They
 say the prime minister is rough. So what was going to happen here? Were
 we going to kneel down in front of these (people)?' Erdogan said after 
the action to clear the square began on Tuesday morning.

'If
 you call this roughness, I'm sorry, but this Tayyip Erdogan won't 
change,' he told a meeting of his AK party's parliamentary group.

The unrest has knocked investor confidence in a country that has boomed under Erdogan. The lira, already suffering from wider market turmoil, fell on Tuesday to its weakest level against its dollar/euro basket since October 2011.

The cost of insuring Turkish debt against default rose to its highest in 10 months, although it remained far from crisis levels.

Turkey's Medical Association said that as of late Monday, 4,947 people had sought treatment in hospitals and voluntary infirmaries for injuries, ranging from cuts and burns to breathing difficulties from tear gas inhalation, since the unrest began more than 10 days ago. Three people have died.
