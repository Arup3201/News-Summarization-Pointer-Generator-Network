Not since his ancestor led the Charge of the Light Brigade had an Earl of Cardigan been accused of involvement in such a foolhardy confrontation.

David Brudenell-Bruce looked like a ‘man possessed’ as he clashed with a trustee of his family estate after losing a legal battle over heirlooms, a court heard yesterday.

Old Etonian Brudenell-Bruce, 60,  had taken former friend John Moore to the High Court accusing him of selling family portraits without his permission.

A week after a judge rejected the 
Earl’s claim that the trustees had overstepped their power, he and Mr 
Moore were involved in a confrontation on his 4,500-acre Savernake 
Estate, near Marlborough, Wiltshire in which the trustee alleged the 
aristocrat ‘lost control’, spat, threw stones and called his wife an 
‘ugly sow’.

But after a day-long trial at 
Salisbury magistrates’ court, the Earl was cleared of assaulting Mr 
Moore and of a second charge of damaging a pick-up truck driven by the 
estate’s foreman in a separate incident.

Chairman of the bench Dr Pauline 
Tremlett said the Crown had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt,
adding: ‘We accept there is a background of acrimony between Lord 
Cardigan, the estate trustees and its staff.’

She said both men had been ‘insulting 
each other’s wives’ in an argument that became ‘more and more heated and
then became puerile’.

Argument: Trustee John Moore, pictured with wife Monique, had claimed the 60-year-old Earl looked 'fearsome' as he shouted at his wife, spat at him and threw debris at his car

The Earl, who appeared in court under 
the name Lord David Brudenell-Bruce Cardigan, is an indirect descendant 
of the 7th Earl, who in 1854 led the disastrous British cavalry charge 
of the 600 ‘into the valley of death’ against the Russians in the 
Crimean War.

Leaving court, Lord Cardigan – the 
father of singer Bo Bruce, who was runner-up on BBC talent show The 
Voice – said: ‘I am delighted and relieved. I wasn’t looking for trouble
on either incident.’

Mr Moore, a friend of 30 years, had 
said he was driving home through the estate on April 29 last year when 
he was forced to stop  because the Earl’s dog ran into the road.

He claimed he was pleasant to the 
Earl, who responded with ‘vulgar abuse’, spat at him three times, waved a
stick in his face and threw roadside debris at him.

Treasures: The Earl of Cardigan lost a legal battle with Mr Moore over the ancestral portraits a week before the alleged attack on his family estate. He has been cleared of any wrongdoing

Grand history: The Earl of Cardigan, who leases a lodge on the 4,200-acre estate, had denied the charges

Mr Moore said: ‘His eyes were wide open and he looked like a man possessed. My wife was terrified.’

His wife Monique said: ‘David called 
me an ugly sow. He looked fierce and frightening.’

Mike Pulsford, 
defending, accused Mr Moore of ‘embellishing’ his evidence an said had 
recently received a letter saying the Earl wanted him removed as 
trustee.

Lord Cardigan denied spitting, being 
aggressive with the stick and throwing debris at Mr Moore.

But he 
admitted calling Mr Moore’s wife an ‘ugly sow’ and exchanging ‘puerile’ 
insults ‘like two children in a playground’.

He and his wife Joanne tried to get away on several occasions.

‘My wife was getting more and more 
upset,’ Lord Cardigan said. ‘He [Mr Moore] told my wife “You’re too fat.
It looks like you could do with the bloody exercise”.’

Lady Cardigan 
told the court: ‘If anything, we were the victims. We were just walking 
our dog and trying to get away.

'John was just saying “It’s all your 
fault the estate is in trouble”. David must have said “go away” six or 
seven times.’

Lord Cardigan told the court he has a 
49 per cent stake in the estate, which has been in his family since 
1067. His son has the other part, and it is administered by two 
trustees.

He moved to the US in 2005 and claims 
that on his return in April 2011, he found the trustees had removed oil 
paintings worth £1million from Savernake Lodge, which he leases from the
estate.

He argued the pictures were ‘tenant’s fixtures’ and should not have been sold without his permission.

But the High Court concluded the paintings were held by the trustees.
