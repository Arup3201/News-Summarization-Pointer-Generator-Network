Police said he had 'fallen closer to about 40 metres down the cliff face' at the Royal National Park 

Mr Ardoin had been bushwalking through the National Park with a group of seven friends from Wollongong University, including his girlfriend, when he slipped down an embankment.

His friends witnessed him fall north of Little Marley Beach and were assisting police with their inquires.
