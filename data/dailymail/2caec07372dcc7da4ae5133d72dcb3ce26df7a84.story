Manchester City's stars were put through a gruelling training session by Manuel Pellegrini and his staff, ahead of their title showdown against Chelsea on Saturday evening.

Pellegrini's side are currently four points behind the leaders and they know that a win will not only close the gap but will make the consecutive 2-0 home defeats by Arsenal and Middlesbrough a distant memory.

Yaya Toure and new signing Wilfried Bony could be involved in the clash, if the Ivory Coast are knocked out of the Africa Cup of Nations tonight, and that would be a huge boost for the Premier League's reigning champions.

Manchester City's stars were put through a tough training session at the club's state-of-the-art training complex ahead of Saturday's clash

Sergio Aguero's (left) return to the squad has been a boost Pellegrini, who has been playing without a recognised striker in some games 

The Manchester City manager's head-to-head record against Jose Mourinho is less than impressive - with the Chelsea manager winning seven out of their previous ten meetings and Pellegrini only winning once.

The two sides managed a 1-1 draw earlier in the season at the Etihad Stadium when ex-Chelsea star Frank Lampard scored a vital late equaliser for home side, after Andre Schurrle had put the visitors ahead.

Potentially some good news for Aguero and his teammates is the news that Diego Costa could face a three-match ban after being involved in a number of incidents against Liverpool last night.

The striker is adjudged to have stamped on Emre Can and has been charged but the FA found the striker not guilty of another misdemeanor but this time on defender Martin Skrtel. 

Chelsea are also sweating on the fitness of Cesc Fabregas after he was taken off complaining of a tight hamstring. 

But there can be no excuses this time round if the Champions fail to get a result against Jose Mourinho's depleted side and close the gap on the league leaders.
