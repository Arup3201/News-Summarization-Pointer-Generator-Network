The missing 12-year-old boy who was found in his own basement has been turned over to his mother, as it emerged his stepmother has been arrested on an unrelated weapons charge.

Charlie Bothuell V was missing for 11 days before he was found in the Detroit home where he lived with his father and stepmother on Wednesday. Police would not reveal what he has told investigators but said child abuse has not
 been ruled out.

The boy is not allowed to speak with the couple as the investigation 
continues. Sources previously said his father, Charles Bothuell IV, had beat his son and forced 
him into grueling exercise regimes.

'We are getting some good information from Charlie,' Sgt Michael Woody told CNN. 'We're getting all the information we can for prosecutors so they can decide whether they'll be able to file charges, if any.'

Arrest: Monique Dillard-Bothuell is arraigned for a probation violation at Frank Murphy Hall of Justice in Detroit on Friday, two days after her stepson was found in her basement. He had been missing for 11 days

After the boy was found, Bothuell's 
step-mother, Monique Bothuell, was arrested for a probation violation on
 an unrelated weapons charge and taken into police custody, authorities 
said. She was arraigned on Friday.

Authorities had 
obtained a warrant for Monique Bothuell's arrest on Monday, but held out
 until Thursday to take her into custody later claiming the search for 
Charlie took priority.

The 37-year-old had pleaded guilty to 
purchasing a pistol without a permit earlier this year and had been put 
on a two-year probation period.

On Thursday, Charlie met with child psychologists before talking to police and will likely meet with detectives again Friday.

Found: Charlie Bothuell V was found hiding in his father's basement after he'd been missing for 11 days

Police sources told WJBK that
 he allegedly beat his son, who was homeschooled, with a PVC pipe and 
gave him a grueling exercise regime. Blood was reportedly found in the 
boy's room.

His
 stepmother reportedly told police the boy didn't complete his daily 
exercise routine and when she told his father, Charlie ran away.

The news channel reported that 
the boy had claimed his stepmother was helping him hide out 
and giving him food - but the family attorney has denied the claim.

Woody wouldn't comment on whether there was any sign the child had been abused.

Charlie's two siblings, a four-year-old and a 10-month-old, have also been taken into protective custody.

Leaving court: His father, Charles Bothuell IV, leaves the Detroit court on Friday after his wife' appearance

Remaining questions: Police have said they are not ruling out child abuse in the bizarre case

Police
 are now focusing on the circumstances surrounding the boy's 
disappearance and his surprising recovery Wednesday afternoon, when 
officers found him hiding behind boxes and a large plastic drum in his 
basement, with bedding nearby.

His
 father, who made tearful television pleas for help, says he had no idea
 his son was in the basement but police don't believe he was there the 
whole time.

The father was on live television on HLN with Nancy Grace when he learned that his son had been found in the home's basement.

'We're getting reports that your son has been found in your basement,' Grace said.

As the shocked father struggled to 
comprehend the news - grabbing his chest and looking stunned - Grace 
demanded to know whether or not he had checked his basement.

'I
 checked my basement,' Bothuell said. 'The FBI checked my basement. The 
police checked my basement. My wife checked my basement. I've been down 
there several times. We've all been checking.'

He said that authorities had even 
brought in dogs to check the basement of their Detroit townhouse but the
 boy had not been found.

Charlie Bothuell, who was last seen when he took a break from working out and went to the bathroom, was discovered as authorities searched the home.

Detroit Police Chief James Craig said 
when police found the boy, he appeared to be hiding behind a makeshift barrier of boxes and did 
not announce himself.

Craig 
said that he believes it is unlikely that the boy could have constructed
 the barrier himself. He was also behind a large plastic drum and 
bedding was found 
nearby.

Stunned: Charlie Bothuell IV was shocked into silence on Wednesday when HLN's Nancy Grace told him his 12-year-old son had been found alive in his basement, 11 days after he vanished

Overwhelmed: Bothuell clutched his chest and breathed heavily after learning that his son had been found

'There's no way he could have erected 
this make-shift area of concealment, I'll call it,' Craig told WJBK. 'He
 certainly was excited to see us. I had a chance to actually talk and 
embrace Charlie.

'He indicated he was hungry. He appeared fine.'

In
 the basement, a tunnel leads from apartment to apartment and to the 
outside, meaning he could have come and gone when he needed to, WJBK 
reported.

Craig
 told reporters earlier Wednesday that the boy's father had taken a 
polygraph test about his son's disappearance, but the boy's stepmother 
declined to do so.

Mr Bothuell's test came back inconclusive, WDIV reported.

He also told authorities that Charlie had ran away from home two years ago, but police found him after three hours.
