It's the playground favourite that most of us left behind with our school books but now it seems the humble hula hoop has become a must-have for adults on a mission to get fit.

Among the stars professing their love for the hula hoop are Kelly Osbourne, Beyonce, model Kelly Brook and now TOWIE fitness queen, Lucy Mecklenburgh.

And so in love with hula hooping is Mecklenburgh, she's revealed that not only has she included it in one of her new fitness videos, she's totally 'hooked' on it.

Hooked: TOWIE Lucy Mecklenburgh says she's a huge fan of the fitness benefits of hula hooping

'I loved hula hooping as a child but I'd completely forgotten how much fun it is,' said the reality TV star told MailOnline. 

'"Dance hooping" takes it to a whole new level and it works out my entire body out, strengthening my core and burning calories as well as, if not better than, any other boring exercise.'

'I’m all about hula-hooping right now!' tweeted Kelly Osbourne in May. 'Five mins in the morning, five mins at night...'

According to Osbourne, the humble hula not only shaved two inches off her waistline, it helped her lose an impressive 70lb to boot.

Brook, meanwhile, has frequently been pictured showing off her whittled down waist while hula hooping, while singer Grace Jones credits a hula hoop fitness regime for her fabulous figure.

What's more, unlike many celebrity fitness fads, the hula hoop routine has the blessing of the professionals to boot.

'I am a major fan of anything that gets people active and moving,' says Jéan LK, founder of central London gym, Timed Fitness. 'Throw in the fun factor and hula hooping is a great addition to a fitness regime.'

He added: 'A hula hoop is a great, affordable, often forgotten, piece of fitness equipment.

'It engages your core and will help tone your upper and lower abs, as well as your obliques, which will help define your waistline. You can also use the hoop to bust bingo wings and tone your inner thighs.'

And Jéan isn't the only fitness expert to sing the praises of the humble hula. According to the American Council on Exercise you can burn 210 calories per 30 minute session.

Hula hooping website, Hooping.org, adds: 'The test subjects in that study were new hoopers and the better you get and the more 'active' you become while hooping will increase your caloric burn.

'You can burn more calories by increasing the intensity, focus on hold your core firm, and back straight to tone your stomach and improve your core stability,' adds Jéan.

'Many people forget that hula hoop can help with more than your waistline. Go for a full body work out by trying different moves like the orbit and bump.'

Mecklenburgh, whose fabulously toned bikini body generated thousands of envious headlines over the summer, added: 'I'm hooked!'

And with results like those, it's not hard to see why.

Still trying to pull of the same hula moves you employed in the playground? As fitness expert Jéan LK explains, you need to up your game to get the full benefits. Here's how to do it:

UP YOUR SPEED

'Try doing it at higher intensity as you get better at it,' he says. 'Go as fast as you can for 30 seconds the normal pace for 30.'

DROP A (HOOP) SIZE

'Get a child sized hoop,' suggests Jéan. 'The smaller the hoop, the harder you have to work to keep the momentum going.'

ADD WEIGHTS TO YOUR HOOP

'Weighted hoops will make it even more of a workout,' explains Jéan.

DON'T JUST HOOP - EAT WELL TOO

'Nutrition is a major factor when it comes to any type of exercise,' reveals Jéan, 'so stay on top of yours.'

MIX IT UP

'Be creative with your routine,' says Jéan. 'Try different stances to engage different muscles.' He suggests starting with your feet wide apart with your toes pointed outwards, then changing to feet shoulder width apart and ending with your feet together. For those who want a tougher workout, Jéan suggests mixing a core routine with hula. 'Do 30 second hula and then get straight down to do 30 second side plank, full plank or crunches,' he advises.
