The mother of a Texas middle school student wants an apology after an administrator colored on her son's head with a dark marker because they claim he had a 'gang-related' haircut.

Monica Esquivel's son Kobi was attending Coronado Middle School in Plainview with a haircut featuring a line shaved on the side of his head for the last five months.

An assistant principal told Kobi his hair was a 'distraction' and colored in the line with a marker earlier this week.

Monica Esquivel wants the Plainview Indepedent School District to apologize for what happened with Kobi

Officials from the Plainview Independent School District failed to notify Esquivel about what had happened with her son, KCBD reported. 

When she did speak to them, school administrators informed her Kobi's haircut could be considered gang related.

She said: 'My son is not in a gang, he's not trying to be in a gang. He dresses in khakis, a shirt, not in loose pants or anything, just real nice and casual. 

'He isn't representing a gang or anything.'

The school district's dress code policy 'prohibits designs shaved into the scalp and this includes lines'

The school district's executive director for administrative services, Greg Brown, said any concerns regarding the assistant principal's behavior will be addressed confidentially, according to the Plainview Daily Herald.

Brown said district policy 'prohibits designs shaved into the scalp and this includes lines'.

He added: 'The dress code is a part of the parent/student handbook that is made available to all students online and in paper form.

'The dress code is specifically looked at by the administration who makes any changes that need to be made.'

Final approval about the handbook is usually issued in July. 

Esquivel wants the Plainview Indepedent School District to apologize to her son and also update its dress code policy. 

Kobi will be allowed to grow his hair out to cover the shaved line. 

This situation is similar to one that happened about a year ago in Florida.

Last January, a school counselor at Harns Marsh Middle School in Lehigh Acres shaved a student's head because he felt the 11-year-old's hair was a distraction and could be gang related, NBC 2 reported.
