Speaking out: Boston Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy released a statement through his Twitter account, saying that he and his wife are 'heartbroken' over the death of Jennifer Martel, allegedly at the hands of his son

Longtime Boston Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy has opened
up about the allegations that his son stabbed to death his girlfriend, saying that
his ‘disgust and remorse’ were indescribable.

In a statement released through his Twitter account
Saturday, Remy said he and his wife are ‘heartbroken’ over the death of
Jennifer Martel on Thursday night, allegedly at the hands of his 34-year-old son,
Jared.

‘Words cannot describe my wife's and my grief,’ Jerry Remy
wrote. ‘Son or not, I am at loss for words articulating my disgust and remorse
over this senseless and tragic act.’

Jared Remy pleaded not guilty in Waltham District Court on
Friday on charges of murder and domestic assault and battery in the killing of
Martel, 27, which came one day after he was released without bail from custody after assaulting
her.

Jerry Remy is a former Red Sox second baseman who has been a color analyst on team broadcasts on the New England Sports Network since 1988.

He has been battling lung cancer in recent years, but has stayed on as the Red Sox announcer. NESN said Friday that he will be off the air through next weekend.

Jerry Remy said Saturday that his thoughts and prayers go out to the victim's mom and her family.

Also on Saturday, Martel's uncle, Richard Martel Jr, said in an interview with Good Morning America that Thursday's tragedy did not come to him as a surprise given the number of red flags in her relationship with Remy.

Warning signs: Jenifer's uncle, Richard Martel Jr, said he had predicted that her relationship with Remy would not end well

‘He never let her go out anywhere, he wanted her for himself,’ he said. ‘She's dead now, and I predicted it to my friends.’

Police arrived at the residence in the Windsor Village apartment complex
at around 9.30pm Thursday following multiple 911 calls. They found 
Martel, 27, bleeding in the fenced-in patio covered in stab wounds.

Middlesex Assistant District Attorney Lisa McGovern said Remy attacked Martel in the kitchen, in the living room and on a stairway before pinning her to the ground of the patio where he stabbed her repeatedly.

'Great force and great effort was made by this defendant in stabbing Miss Martel over and over and over again' McGovern said, labeling the attack a 'protracted struggle.'

Remy, a hulking muscle-man, was arrested at the scene after he held his hands over his head and surrendered to officers. His clothing was soaked with Martel's blood and, according to WBZ-TV, he had an engagement ring in a sunglasses case in his pocket.

Just feet away lay Martel's body, shirtless and covered in blood with stab wounds to her front left shoulder area as well as wounds to her neck. A blue cloth covered her face.

'There was a substantial amount of blood on the ground surrounding the victim's head and upper torso area,' police said. 'Martel was motionless, not breathing.'

Horror: The stabbing took place while the couple's daughter, pictured, was home

On Wednesday, Remy, who in 2005 
admitted beating up a former girlfriend, appeared in Waltham District 
Court to face allegations that he assaulted Martel in a domestic 
violence incident on Tuesday night. He allegedly threw her against a mirror.

He was released on personal 
recognizance, and Ryan said that 
the bail recommendation made by her office was based, in part, on a 
conversation with Martel.

'The bail recommendation was based on a totality of circumstances,' Ryan said.

She
added: 'On Wednesday, a (bail) request was made based on the 
information that we had on Wednesday. Obviously and tragically, there is
different information today, Friday morning.'

Martel's mother told The Boston Herald that her daughter had been 'planning her escape' when she was allegedly murdered by her long-time boyfriend.

'She said, "I was planning my escape,"' Patty Martel, 53, said. 'This was on Wednesday. She said, "Don’t worry, I’m planning my escape."'

Her mother is furious Remy was released after the assault on Tuesday night and blames the blunder for her daughter's death.

'(Prosecutors) did not do their job,' Patty Martel said. 'They failed. She would be alive today if they had put him away.'

Patty Martel said her daughter had returned to her apartment yesterday to get her belongings before fleeing.

'She went back to the house to go get stuff and that's when he killed her,' she said. 'And that's why he killed her, because she called the cops on him.'

At least one neighbor, Benjamin Ray, in the apartment complex rushed to Martel's aid and tried to pull Remy off her. But he was driven back when Remy waved his knife in Ray's direction, McGovern said.

'It's not an easy thing to watch. It's not an easy thing to try and stop,' Ray told Boston.com. 'I did what I could to stop it. And it wasn't enough.'

Witnesses told police they saw Remy 'on top of Miss Martel stabbing her repeatedly with the knife' on the patio.

A large bloodstain was visible on the patio on Friday next to a small pink tricycle. An evidence marker with the number 1 on it was placed next to the stain.

Remy pleaded not guilty on Friday and 
has been ordered held without bail. Remy's defense attorney, Peter 
Bella, did not contest the bail order.

'I've been in contact with the Remys. They are devastated, he said. 'This is a very sad and tragic day for two families.'

Patty Martel described her daughter as 'an excellent, loving mother' to her daughter Arianna.

'She
had so much to look forward to in her life,' she said. 'She planned on 
getting married, but she broke it off and told me she was never going to
marry him. ... In the last few years my daughter wasn't happy. He would
do anything and everything to keep them away from us. It got worse in 
the last few months but she never told me it was to the point where it 
was this.'

She said she was determined to take custody of her granddaughter.

'I don't want him to get his hands on her. If he gets out that's the first thing he's going to do is try to get her. He just traumatized his daughter for the rest of her life.'

A neighbor told Boston.com
last night: 'It's creepy, it's a couple hundred yards from my window,' as Waltham police and State Police investigated the bloody 
crime scene. 'The little girl was literally selling lemonade the other 
day.'

Remy suffered an unspecified injury 
that wasn't self-inflicted, authorities said. He was taken to a hospital
and released before the arraignment.

Another neighbor described Remy as a very nice guy, though he had 15 prior cases out of Waltham District Court between 1998-2010, according to the Boston Herald.

In 2009, Remy, then a security guard 
for the Red Sox, and a colleague were accused of using steroids. He was 
fired after he admitted using the performance-enhancing drug, but he 
denied supplying steroids to his coworker.

The couple's daughter was unhurt is now in the custody of the Department of Children and Families. They also had two pitbulls.

Jerry Remy is a former Red Sox second baseman who has been a color analyst on team broadcasts on the New England Sports Network since 1988. He has struggled with health problems in recent years.

New England Sports Network, which broadcasts Red Sox games, issued a statement on Friday afternoon.

'This morning, we learned of a terrible tragedy,' the statement read. 'All of us at NESN and the Red Sox, along with Jerry Remy, are filled with grief for everyone involved, and we extend our deepest sympathies to the family of Jennifer Martel.'
