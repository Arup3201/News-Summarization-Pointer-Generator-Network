Children's charity Barnardo's has admitted offering Made In Chelsea star Binky Felstead thousands of pounds to promote its work online.

In a decision that has horrified supporters the organisation confessed agreeing to pay the 24-year-old £3,000 to take part in a campaign to get more people to shop in its 500-plus UK stores.

The revelation came after Binky, whose real name is Alexandra, posted a photograph of herself on Instagram, in which she held a hand-written sign asking her followers to 'please follow Barnardo's' on the social networking site.

Barnardo's, which earned an income of about £242million last year, confirmed on Twitter it had offered her in the region of £3,000 for her support.

Today the Made In Chelsea star's spokesman said she had not yet been paid by Barnardo's and has now asked the charity to keep the money.

Her spokesman said: 'Binky has agreed to waiver her £3,000 fee. Her decision to work with Barnardos was always for good intentions. She was offered this fee to front a campaign. However her intention has always been to give the entire fee back to charity in some way'.

Initially the reality TV star had said she planned to donate some of her fee to a cancer charity but has now changed her mind.

However, both Barnado's  - which supports vulnerable children - and Binky denied reports in The Sun that she had been paid £20,000.

Taking to her official Twitter page, Binky dismissed the claim as 'total lies', while the Barnardo's Twitter page said: 'Our retail trading arm operates in commercial environment & is paying £3k for campaign.' 

Barnardo's added in a statement that it had taken a 'business decision to acquire the support' of Binky.

A charity spokesman said: 'Barnardo's retail shops are part of the charity's trading arm and as such operate in a commercial environment.

'We are soon to launch a new campaign to encourage much-needed donations to our shops.

'We took a business decision to acquire the support of Alexandra Felstead to bring the appeal to a new and wider audience. We expect the campaign to increase donations significantly and will be monitoring its impact on our sales.

'Barnardo's does not usually pay celebrities who support our work with the most vulnerable children across the UK.'

The move sparked outrage from some charity fundraisers, with campaigning Tory MP Charlie Elphicke describing it as an 'insult to volunteers who toil to raise cash for needy children'.

One source, reportedly a friend of Binky's, told The Sun: 'To take money from a charity to help it is morally repulsive. The fact Barnardo's is paying her in the first place is even worse.

'If I give fifty quid to help abused kids I want it to be used for that purpose – not redistributed by a celebrity to a different charity.'

The fashion and beauty blogger, rose to fame after appearing on E4's Made In Chelsea, alongside the likes of Spencer Matthews, Louise Thompson, Lucy Watson, Oliver Proudlock and Jamie Laing.

Binky is not the first celebrity to be paid to promote a charity.

Downton Abbey star  Elizabeth McGovern - who plays Cora, Countess of Grantham - was paid £28,000 by World Vision in 2013 for her band Sadie and the Hotheads to record an album and tour the UK in return for promoting the charity. 

She said at the time without the cash her band would 'never survive'.
