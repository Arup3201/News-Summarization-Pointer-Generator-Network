Peter Crouch may not be a certain starter for Stoke City these days but the former England international is enjoying life off the pitch after his model wife Abbey Clancy posted a series of snaps.

The pictures on Clancy’s Instagram show the former Strictly Come Dancing star cavorting with her husband Crouch, who has begun the new Premier League season with Stoke City.

Clancy posted the loved up snaps with captions such as ‘lick me’, ‘sex on legs’ and ‘marry me again and again’ as the couple posed for the camera.

Crouch came on as a substitute as Stoke fell to an opening fixture 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa on the weekend.

The former England international faces increased competition to lead the line for Stoke this season with the arrival of former Barcelona star Bojan Krkic this summer.

Crouch fired in eight league goals for The Potters last season and was linked with a move back to QPR under former manager Harry Redknapp but has so stayed put to fight for his place.
