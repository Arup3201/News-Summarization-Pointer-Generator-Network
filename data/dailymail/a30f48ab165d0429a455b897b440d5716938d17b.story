A village vicar who says he was forced out of his job has been told he cannot claim unfair dismissal because he is ‘employed by God.’

Reverend Mark Sharpe claims he had no option but to resign after a campaign of abuse by parishioners he likened to characters out of the League of Gentleman.

The 44-year-old Reverend accused the church of failing to support him in the remote country parish in Teme Valley South, near Tenbury Wells.

After his resignation, he compared his treatment at the hands of parishioners with the television show in which a 
remote community is fearful of outsiders.

Rev Sharpe said: ‘This 
is a local parish for local people - that is the attitude.When I arrived
here, I held a lunch for the church wardens of all six churches.

‘At the end of the lunch, one of the 
wardens, Sally Jones, boasted that they didn’t get on with the previous 
rector so they “chewed him up and spat him out”.’

Mrs Jones denies that she made this comment.

His claim of constructive dismissal was being supported by Unite, the union.

But lawyers for the Diocese of 
Worcester pointed to ecclesiastical laws which state that clergy are not 
employees but office holders ‘employed by God.’

They say vicars are therefore not eligible to claim unfair dismissal, because God cannot be sued.

After moving to the parish in 2005, Rev Sharpe said he was subjected to constant harassment and even threats.

The locals were so hostile to the new vicar that he installed CCTV cameras to protect his family.

Rev Sharpe says his dog was poisoned,
animal excrement was smeared on his car, his tyres were slashed, his 
home phone lines were cut and his heating oil was stolen.

One church warden even objected to 
Rev Sharpe’s beard, warning him that locals wanted a ‘clean shaven 
clergyman’, Birmingham’s Phoenix House Tribunal Centre heard.

Rev Sharpe claims he asked Bishops to help him, but they ‘washed their hands’ of the case.

He eventually left in September 2009 after developing stress-related ill-health.

Rev Sharpe told an employment hearing that he had written to Bishops begging them to intervene, but they refused to help him.

‘What confused and upset and distressed me was that I was told: “We are not dealing with it. Doors shut, end of,”’ he said.

‘I was told that I couldn’t access a grievance procedure, that I didn’t have any rights.’

Instead, he said, a series of 
replacement vicars were ‘parachuted in’, one of whom was ‘preparing 
secret reports to the bishop’ about him, including comments he had made 
in ‘confidential meetings.’

In December 2009, the Reverend’s wife
and three youngest children left the dilapidated four-bedroom rectory 
after the Diocese of Worcester launched eviction proceedings against 
them. Their eldest child was away at university.

At the time, the Reverend Sharpe, who
was ordained in 2001, said: ‘My career has been ruined, my health and 
that of my wife and children has been shattered, and my family has 
suffered terribly from all the strain.’

Reverend Sharpe said the Diocese had 
‘glossed over’ the serious problems in the parish, which is made up of 
six churches in local hamlets and villages, when he agreed to move his 
family there.

‘When we came here, I was told by the
church that they were looking for stability, as the last vicar had left
after 18 months for health reasons.

If most employees resign from their job because of an employer’s behaviour, it may be considered to be constructive dismissal. They would need to show that:

‘I found a situation that was allowed
to fester for decades, where of the four local parishes only three were
legally constituted because two had refused to merge

‘This dated back to 1979 and I was staggered that it had not been sorted out already.

‘When I tackled it, it sparked a wave
of resentment from the community which has culminated in my family and I
living in a climate of fear in a supposedly rural idyll.

‘There have been too many incidences of harassment over the last four years for them to be the odd coincidence.’

Describing the beard incident to the tribunal yesterday, Mr Sharpe said: ‘It was a church warden who complained about it.

‘I said I had grown a beard because I had a skin infection.’

When asked if the warden had then retracted their objection to the beard, Mr Sharpe replied: ‘If only it had been that simple.’

Rev Sharpe has not worked as a vicar since leaving the parish, and has been diagnosed with M.E, the chronic fatigue illness.

His wife, an environmental health officer, said: ‘I feel like four precious years of family life have been robbed from us.

‘It has been the worst time of my life. I used to be a committed Christian, now I am agnostic.

‘If this is Christianity in action I don’t want anything to do with it.’

Unite officer Rachael Maskell said: 
‘The fact that Mark and his family have been forced to leave their home 
during the so-called season of goodwill at the pinnacle of the Christian
year is a disgrace, and a dark stain on the church’s reputation.

‘This is a toxic parish with a 40-year history of clergy leaving abruptly or in broken health.’
