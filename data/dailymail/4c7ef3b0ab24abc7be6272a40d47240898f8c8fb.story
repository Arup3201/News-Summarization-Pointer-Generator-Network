This was the scene of carnage when methane from a giant cesspit in China exploded, destroying buildings and showering an area the size of a football pitch in human waste.

Fifteen people were injured when the tank erupted in a fireball at the heart of a residential neighbourhood in Zhangjiajie city, in the central province of Hunan.

Witnesses fled in panic as foul-smelling excrement rained down from the sky in the moments that followed the blast, smashing windows and sullying homes. 

Carnage: This was the scene of carnage when methane from a huge cesspit in China exploded, destroying a building and showering an area the size of a football field in human waste

Injuries: Fifteen people were injured when the tank erupted in a fireball in the heart of a residential neighbourhood in the city of Zhangjiajie, in the central province of Hunan

The eruption, which happened at 5pm on November 22, was sparked when local man Ding Hao, 49, tried to dispose of some rubbish by burning it in the courtyard of his home.

A spark from the fire is believed to have drifted into the stinking sump, igniting the methane trapped within.

Police spokesman Dewei Hsiao said: 'There appears to have been a build-up of methane from the waste pit which was filled with excrement from the surrounding residential buildings. A spark from the fire seems to have ignited this, causing a massive explosion.'

Don't mind the stench: Rescue workers dig through the rubble, without face masks, which was covered in yellow waste from the tank

Bright spark: The incident began when local man Ding Hao, 49, decided to get rid of some rubbish by burning it in the courtyard of his home

The ensuing blast not only knocked down the building located above the cesspit, but also severely damaged other buildings in a wide area around the property.

The police spokesman said that it appeared the cesspit had not been properly ventilated to prevent a build-up of methane, and it had also not been emptied for some time.

He said it was lucky that nobody was killed by the explosion, which happened during the day when most residents were at work and the building was not inhabited. Most of those injured were people in nearby properties and pedestrians.

Damage: The ensuing blast not only knocked down the building located above the cesspit, but also severely damaged other buildings in a wide area around the property

Poor standards: Although properties are usually connected to the public sewerage network, China's urban infrastructure has often been hastily built with little regard for basic standards

Shoddy: The builders of this property had apparently not wanted to wait for the sewer network to be extended to the area

Manual: Instead they had opted for a septic tank that needed to be manually emptied

Instead they had opted for a septic tank that needed to be manually emptied.

It is one of many examples of property developers flaunting safety as hundreds of millions of people have moved from the countryside to cities in recent decades.

Smashed: The blast even smashed windows, sending human waste flying into nearby homes

And septic tank incidents are increasingly common. At the start of the year a man and his mother both died trying to retrieve his wife's new mobile phone - worth 2,000 yuan (£200) - from a toilet septic tank.

The man jumped in to try to locate the phone but was overcome by fumes and passed out, according to Dahe, a web portal run by the provincial government in central Henan province.
