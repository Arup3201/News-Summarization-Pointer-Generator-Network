Local delicacy: Grasshoppers, which are already commonly eaten in Mexico, will provide the base for the first batches of Power Flour

Scientists have begun work to develop a protein rich flour, called Power Flour, which is made from insects and could feed millions in malnourished populations.

Students from McGill University in Montreal were awarded the $1 million dollar Hult Prize to help with the production of the sustainable food staple which can produced and consumed in poor countries.

Initially the team plan to recruit farmers to work on production in Mexico, where around 4 million people live in poverty and their is widespread malnutrition.

The first batches of the flour will be made from grasshoppers, which are already common fare in the North American nation.

Mohammed Ashour is the leader of the McGill team who pioneered what could be a revolutionary food stuff for the developing world.

Speaking to ABC news, he said: 'It's a huge deal because we had a very ambitious but highly executable five-year plan in place.

'So winning this prize is a great step in that direction.'

Ashour worked along with teammates Shobhita Soor, Jesse Pearlstein, Zev Thompson and Gabe Mott.

They are now setting up an advisory board to oversee the first stages of Power Flour production.

Speaking of their decision to begin with the humble grasshopper, Ashour explained the importance of using insects which are already familiar in the local diet.

He said farmers have already expressed interest in raising grasshoppers on a mass level.

The project is expected to be popular in areas of the world where insects are already a palatable food source.

In many nations outside the western world they are already considered an important source of protein.

And the type of insect used in each nation can vary depending on local eating habits.

People of Ghana, for example, prefer palm weevils whereas in Botswana caterpillars are popular.

The
committed scientists who developed the productÂ  said they have consumed
kilos of the creepy crawlies as part of their research.

Staple: The bugs will be used to produce a flour that is 'rich in protein'

Foodstuff: Insects have already made their way into some western dishes, such as this Grasshopper plate from Wahaca, but scientists they can be used for good in poor malnourished populations

Ashour said: 'Shobhita was recently researching in Thailand and tried everything from worms to water beetles'

Even Mott, who is a vegetarian member of the team, consumed his fair share of basil-flavored palm weevil.

Ashour said: 'He's a vegetarian for ethical and ecological reasons, and when he looked at insects, for him it was really not an issue as far as being a source of protein that is ecologically balanced'
