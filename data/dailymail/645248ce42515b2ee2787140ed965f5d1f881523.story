A New Jersey man shot and killed his hospitalized wife on Wednesday and then tried to kill himself, prompting investigators to search their home, where their son was found fatally shot, authorities said. 

Raymond Wychowanec, 63, allegedly shot and killed his wife Denise, 62, on the second floor of Kennedy University Hospital, WPVI-TV reported.

Hospital staff said Wychowanec visited his wife about 9:30am. Shots rang through the hospital a half hour after that, they told police.

Authorities visited the couple's home in nearby Glendora as a routine step in their investigation, Captain Ron Moten of the county prosecutor's office said. There, they found the body of the couple's 35-year-old son, Ryan Wychowanec. 

Witnesses at the hospital say a couple of gunshots were heard in the hallway — followed by screams of panic.

'All the sudden the whole floor went pandemonium,' Gordon Bassing, 51, told the The Inquirer. Doctors
 were running in all directions, shutting patients' doors.

'People were just flying all over the place.'

A possible motive for the incident has not been determined.

When investigators went to the couple's home, they found another person fatally wounded there

Numerous law enforcement officers were at the hospital where the shooting occurred, but the hospital was not evacuated.

No further information was available.

People at the hospital were rushed out.
