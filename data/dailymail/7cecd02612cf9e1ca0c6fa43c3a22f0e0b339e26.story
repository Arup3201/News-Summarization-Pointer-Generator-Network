He sparked outrage globally when he blamed all Muslims for deadly jihadi attacks. 

And now, J.K. Rowling has hit out at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's tweet that while 'Maybe most Moslems peaceful', all are responsible for a 'growing jihadist cancer' until they work to destroy it.

Taking to Twitter herself, the 49-year-old British 'Harry Potter' author sarcastically wrote: 'I was born Christian. If that makes Rupert Murdoch my responsibility, I'll auto-excommunicate.'

She later mockingly accepted blame for the Spanish Inquisition, for any violence by Christian fundamentalists and for Jim Bakker, the American televangelist who was jailed for fraud.

By Monday morning, Rowling's initial tweet, posted on Sunday, had been shared more than 23,000 times on the social networking site, with many congratulating her on 'standing up' to Murdoch.

However, some accused of the billionaire novelist f adopting an 'apologist attitude' - and even made reference to her iconic boy wizard character to get their point across.

One user wrote: 'If Harry shared your cowardly apologist attitude the Death Eaters would have killed him & his friends by the third book.'

Unfazed, Rowling replied: 'Smart move, choosing to make your argument by referencing themes in Harry Potter. Keep that up, you're bound to win!'

Despite the immediate public backlash, Murdoch refused to apologize or take back his claims. 

Standing firm: Despite the immediate public backlash, Murdoch refused to apologize. Instead, he posted further tweets in support of his point of view, writing: 'Political correctness makes for denial and hypocrisy'

Michael Monan tweeted: '@rupertmurdoch In the same way that you must be held responsible for ordering the hacking of the voicemails of dead school children?'

The creator of BBC sitcom Citizen Khan, Adil Ray, who said: 'I think all of Australia should be held responsible for Rupert Murdoch.'

Matt Haig added: 'Rupert Murdoch thinks all Muslims should apologise for terrorism. So on behalf of white people I'd like to apologise for Rupert Murdoch.'

Another user joked: 'Maybe most Ruperts peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy cancerous media dinosaur @rupertmurdoch, they must be held responsible.'

To which, Rupert Franklin replied: 'I'd like to offer an apology on behalf of us all. Murdoch's comments don't represent the views of mainstream Rupert community.'

And Matt Haig added: 'Rupert Murdoch wrote a tweet. As someone who uses Twitter I would like to apologise on his behalf.'
