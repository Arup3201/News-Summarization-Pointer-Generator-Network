Bryn Parry-Jones was given a £90,000 Porsche as part of his contract with Pembrokeshire County Council

A shamed council boss at the centre of a row over misuse of public money drove a taxpayer-funded Porsche that his employers kept secret for eight months.

Bryn Parry-Jones, 62, was provided with the £90,000 sports car to drive to and from work despite massive cuts to public services in his area.

But the council refused to reveal the perk, despite repeated information requests by journalists, for eight months – citing ‘privacy’ reasons. Last night the former chief executive was facing a growing row over his use of public money after details of his lavish lifestyle were exposed.

Mr Parry-Jones, whose £195,000-a-year salary made him the highest-earning official in Wales, has been repeatedly accused of abusing taxpayers’ money while heading cash-strapped Pembrokeshire County Council.

Earlier this year he was handed a £280,000 ‘golden goodbye’ despite the fact he had been forced to quit over an unlawful payments scandal. Details of his car, a perk which cost around £900 a month to lease, only emerged this week after a long Freedom of Information battle with the council.

Insiders said the extravagant expense had ‘stuck in the craw’ of cash-strapped council workers who knew about it for months.

Yesterday, campaigners and politicians hit out at the ‘offensive waste of money’ at a time when the council was making cuts to local services.

Earlier this year, Pembrokeshire Council revealed it would have to make savings of £20million over two years. Proposed measures include closing public toilets, charging for social services and increasing parking fees. Council tax rose by 3.4 per cent this year.

Stephen Crabb, Welsh secretary and Pembrokeshire MP, said: ‘These kinds of lavish car deals for council officials, alongside salary and other perks, stick in the throats of people – especially at a time when there is huge pressure on spending.’

The average salary in the county last year was £21,587. Jonathan Isaby, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, added: ‘At a time when the council is trying to find savings, it’s particularly galling that local residents have been taken for such an extortionate ride.’

Mr Parry-Jones, who led the council for 18 years, was given an allowance to run a company car as part of his generous remuneration package. It is understood he took out a lease on the hybrid electric Porsche Panamera in March this year. Journalists first began requesting details of the car under the Freedom of Information Act in April, but the council said it must be kept secret because it was ‘private’.

The expensive sports car was part of the 62-year-old's 'remuneration', according to county officials

It was leased by the council and has been returned since Mr Parry-Jones left his position earlier this year

It was only this week, after he left with his enormous pay out, that the council, run by the Independent Plus Group, revealed details.

Conservative councillor David Bryan said the Porsche was known about within the council and had ‘stuck in the craw’ of council workers facing ‘drastic pay cuts’. Paul Miller, who leads the opposition Labour group on the council, added: ‘He was a dictator and it got to the point where he thought he could do whatever he wanted.’

A council spokesman said: ‘Mr Bryn Parry-Jones was entitled to a lease car as part of his remuneration package.’ Mr Parry-Jones quit his post as chief executive in October, ten months after it was revealed he received more than £45,000 in cash payments in lieu of pension contributions.

The Wales Audit Office said the payments were ‘unlawful’, although a police investigation concluded that no further action should be taken. Mr Parry-Jones finally stepped down after a vote of no confidence from the council – though councillors voted through a sizeable severance package.

Mr Miller applied in vain for a High Court injunction against the pay-off. The council also said it would not be trying to reclaim the £45,606 cash payment.

Mr Parry-Jones, who lives in Letterston, Pembrokeshire could not be contacted for comment last night.
