Tottenham defender Danny Rose has withdrawn from the England squad to face Lithuania and Italy through injury.

Rose was called into the squad after Luke Shaw withdrew on Saturday with a hamstring problem.

But the left-back has now been sent back to his club with an injury of his own.

Rose puts in a strong challenge on Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa during Tottenham's 4-3 win on Saturday 

An FA statement released on Wednesday night read: 'Tottenham Hotspur's Danny Rose has withdrawn from the England camp through injury.

'The left-back will play no further part in preparation for the forthcoming fixtures against Lithuania and Italy and has returned to his club.'

After enjoying a good season with Tottenham, Rose was in line to make his England debut in either the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania on Friday or the friendly in Italy four days later.

But the 24-year-old is now back at Spurs having become the fifth player to pull out of the international double-header since Roy Hodgson announced his squad last week.

Fraser Forster and Luke Shaw withdrew on Saturday and they were followed on Monday by Liverpool pair Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana.

But Everton's Leighton Baines now looks set to start at left-back in both matches, provided he does not sustain an injury against Lithuania at Wembley.

That there has been no replacement called up for Rose comes as something of a surprise as Ryan Bertrand has been enjoying a good season with Southampton.
