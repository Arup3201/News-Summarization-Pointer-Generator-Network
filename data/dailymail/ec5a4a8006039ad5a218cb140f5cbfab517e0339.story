Honour: Football great Sir Bobby Charlton was one of 151 torchbearers due to carry the Olympic flame as it moved from Manchester to Leeds

Every England football fan knows that watching the team can be physically and mentally draining - particularly if the match could go to extra time and penalties.

But Sir Bobby Charlton didn't use tonight's Euro 2012 quarter-final between England and Italy as an excuse to have a Sunday morning lie-in.

The 74-year-old, who won the World Cup with England in 1966, was on duty at 6.30am today to carry the Olympic flame in Manchester.

Hundreds of people got up early and braved the rain to watch Sir Bobby carry the torch as it passed Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium.

The former United player is one of 151 torchbearers due to hold the flame today as it makes its way from Manchester to Leeds.

Sir Bobby carried the flame from Water's Reach to Old Trafford stadium, which is a football venue for this summer's Olympics.

He stopped to speak to cheering fans in front of the iconic Trinity statue, which depicts United's 'Holy Trinity' of himself, George Best and Denis Law.

'This is magic,' he said. 'This is a great place and the fans have been great.'

Sir Bobby said he was overwhelmed by the number of fans who had shown up to see him.

'This time in the morning. It's staggering isn't it? But they like to be part of it and it's just a happy time.

'I'm so proud and so pleased. It's something that we worked for and it's culminated in a fantastic time.'

The
former England hero, who still holds the country's international 
goalscoring record, said he 'never dreamed' that the Olympics would come
to Britain.

'We were so pleased when it happened,' he added. 'It has just been terrific.'
