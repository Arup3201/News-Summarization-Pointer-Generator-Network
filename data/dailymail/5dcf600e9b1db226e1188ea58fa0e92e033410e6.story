Steven Gerrard has told LA Galaxy that he isn’t going to America just to sit on the beach when he quits Liverpool and moves to Major League Soccer this summer.

The Galaxy confirmed Gerrard’s signing on Wednesday following his decision to turn down the offer of a contract extension and leave Liverpool after 17 years.

Gerrard has admitted that he would have signed a new deal if one had been offered to him earlier in the season, and his former Anfield teammate Danny Murphy said that the club’s treatment of their captain ‘stinks’.

The Liverpool captain insists he has not moved to the MLS for a 'holiday' but to continue winning medals

However, the 34-year-old midfielder is already looking to the future and insists that he is joining the five-time MLS champions to help them win more trophies rather than soak up the sunshine in California.

‘Football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years,’ said Gerrard. ‘I’m not going over there for a holiday or to enjoy myself. I’m going over there to win, and if I win and play well, then my life becomes more enjoyable.

‘I still feel like a player. I still feel like I can perform for a number of years, so I want to go to a club with a winning mentality — a team that is used to winning but also a team that’s got people that want to win in the future.

‘Having spoken to the manager Bruce Arena and also the people above him, they’re very aggressive and they want success.

‘That’s what I want. That’s how I want to finish my career, so they are the reasons I chose LA Galaxy. Their pursuing me was very aggressive. They basically told me what I wanted to hear. I hope I can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team.’

Gerrard admitted, however, that the lure of life in Los Angeles played a big part when it came to choosing the right move for his wife Alex and their three young daughters after so long on Merseyside.

‘There’s obviously a bonus of where the LA Galaxy are located as well,’ he said. ‘That will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different.

‘The big challenge is going to be settling in. I’ve lived in Liverpool all my life. I’m a Scouser through and through. I love my city, I love my roots. But, you only get one life. It’s important to try different things and it’s also a big thing for my children too; to give them experiences that will hopefully help them develop as humans as well.’

Gerrard also offered hope to fans still reeling from the news of his departure, saying that he will be back at Anfield in the future.

He added: ‘My message to Liverpool fans, I owe them a lot. I can promise them I will give everything I have got within to try and bring success this season — and hopefully come back.

‘That’s the message: my relationship with Liverpool doesn’t end in the summer. In fact, it will never end.’

However, Murphy believes that Liverpool and manager Brendan Rodgers should have tried harder to keep Gerrard, and suggested that it was always their intention to let him leave.

‘Liverpool let it get to November or December before they offered him anything,’ Murphy told talkSPORT.

‘That says to me that the club and Brendan were already thinking about him moving on. It stinks a bit for me though that they treat a player like that. We saw the same thing with Chelsea and Frank Lampard. Clubs say, “We have offered him a new deal”, but it’s always on reduced wages.

‘It’s not how you should treat someone who has put their all into a club.’

My next team is going to be La Galaxy. I'm really excited for a new challenge in my life - that's the team I will join at the end of the season.

Their pursuing me was very aggressive. The talks Ive had with them are very positive, they basically told me what I wanted to hear. They told me about the winning mentality of the club, their aims and what their goals are for the future and it basically suits me at this stage of my career so I will be hopefully going over there to win some medals and finish my career over there.

There's obviously a bonus of where the LA Galaxy are locateed as well. That will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different. It's really exciting both on and off the pitch but the most important thing is that I go there and it's a success on the pitch and then hopefully I can enjoy it off the pitch as well.

The big challenge is going to be settling in, I've lived in Liverpool all my life. I'm a Scouser through and through. I love my City. I love my roots. But, you only get one life, it's important to try different things and experiences and it's also a big thing for my children too - to take them out of their comfort zone and give them experiences that will hopefully help them develop as humans as well.

It's perfect timing for this new challenge. I'm really excited and looking forward to it, but I've still got a few things that I've got to try and achieve before I go so my focus is on that. There will be plenty of time to get excited at the end of the season about the new move.

It's the right time for a new challenge, a fresh challenge at this point of my life and an exciting one too. I'm going to be moving to the most successful team in the US. I've watched a lot of their games and I also know a few of the players that have been there and sampled it and I've heard great things about it so for this stage of my career I believe the timing is right to move on.

I still feel like a player, I still feel like I can perform for a number of years so I want to go to a club with a winning mentality - a team that is used to winning but also a team that's got people within there that want to win in the future. 

I know the players have got a winning mentality, they've proved it over a number of years. Having spoken to the manager, Bruce Arena, and also the people above him - they're very aggressive and they want success and that's what I want. That's how I want to finish my career so they are the reasons that I chose LA Galaxy.

I'd like to think I've got the same attitude as the people that have tried to make this signing happen - the manager, the CEO and the owner - they all seem to me to be like winners and that is how I see myself. 

I'm very professional and go about my work to a good standard on a daily basis. I like to try and find consistency. I hope I can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team.

What I can guarantee is that I will go there and work hard and I will make sacrifices and be dedicated to perform at a consistent level and hopefully play my part in success for this team.

Football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years. I'm not going over here for a holiday or to enjoy myself. I am going over here to win and if I win and play well then my life becomes more enjoyable.

My message to Liverpool fans, I owe them a lot. It's been a privilege to play for them and represent them for all these years and I will continue to do that until the end of the season and I can promise them I will give everything I have got within to try and bring success this season. And hopefully come back - that's the message, my relationship with Liverpool doesn't end in the summer. In fact it will never end.

For the new team I am going to, I will come over there with the same attitude which 110 per cent every day - be professional, makes sacrifices and try and contribute. I like to think I'm a team player and I will play my part to try and help the team.
