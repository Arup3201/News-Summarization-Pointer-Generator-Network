With the prospect of an Arctic blast hitting the country next week, it’s likely that some of us will be feeling the cold in our hands and feet.

But in my case, my fingers will feel more than just a little chilly. 

It’s likely that, despite wearing gloves, my ring, middle and index finger will go white and numb, while burning with pain as they lose all circulation.

Although attacks peak in the cold winter months, symptoms for Raynaud’s can be triggered by air-conditioning or taking food out of the freezer (file picture)

I’m not alone in suffering this way. 

It’s estimated that ten million people have Raynaud’s, a disproportionate reaction of the circulatory system to even the slightest drop in temperature. 

When this happens, the blood vessels in the fingers and sometimes the toes can contract, cutting off their blood supply.

The most common form of Raynaud’s — the one that I suffer with — is known as primary Raynaud’s phenomenon. 

There is no obvious cause, though it could be genetic — although no one else has been affected in my family. 

About eight out of ten sufferers are women, with most having their first attack before the age of 40. 

In my case, it started in my early 20s, more than 20 years ago.

In some cases, an underlying health condition such as rheumatoid arthritis can cause the blood vessels to overreact — a condition known as secondary Raynaud’s.

It can also be caused by medication such as the contraceptive pill or beta-blockers. In severe cases this can cause ulcers on the skin.

‘Typically, Raynaud’s causes the fingers or toes to turn white and numb as the blood vessels go into spasm in response to cold temperatures,’ says Eddie Chaloner, a consultant vascular surgeon at Lewisham Hospital in South-East London. 

This stops blood flow to the fingers and toes, causing them to turn icy white.

Attacks can last from a few minutes to an hour. As blood flow returns, they turn blue and eventually red, accompanied by a burning sensation. 

The burning is caused by lactic acid — a chemical we also produce after prolonged exercise, such as running — building up in the fingers when blood flow is reduced due to low levels of oxygen, and then being released as blood returns to the area.

Although attacks peak in the cold winter months, symptoms can be triggered by air-conditioning or taking food out of the freezer. 

‘Being a smoker also increases risk as nicotine makes blood vessels contract,’ adds Mr Chaloner

Just putting my hand under a cold tap or daring to step outside with bare hands on a cool summer’s day is enough to trigger my symptoms. Within moments my fingers will be a bloodless white and numb.

Only this morning, a few minutes after stepping out of a (hot) shower, I’d lost all feeling in the top of my middle finger on my right hand because the bathroom was cold in contrast to the hot water.

In winter, I get it several times a week, and a couple of times a month in the summer months —– unless there’s a heatwave.

And I can tell if it’s time to turn on our central heating because as soon as I experience any kind of chill, the tips of both my middle and ring fingers lose all colour. 

If I don’t move quickly, either to cup my hands around a hot drink, or wrap them in a scarf, the familiar deadening feeling spreads to the rest of my index finger, too.

Strangely, it doesn’t always affect my feet —– it’s far more common to affect the hands, though some people suffer with both. 

But to be careful, I always wear thick, woolly tights in the winter as well as thick, sheepskin gloves.

Not only is it uncomfortable, it’s also extremely inconvenient.

For me, little every day manoeuvres such as writing become murderously difficult as it’s impossible to negotiate a pen when your fingers are painfully numb. 

It also makes doing up buttons, punching numbers on a telephone keypad or even using a tin opener difficult.

There is no cure — all that modern medicine can do is offer drugs such as nifedipine, more commonly given for high blood pressure and angina, which works by relaxing blood vessels to alleviate the symptoms.

You use these drugs at the point of need — when you are having an attack — but they don’t address the underlying cause, and stop working when you don’t use them.

‘And some patients can find the side-effects difficult, including bad headaches,’ says Dr Karl Gaffney, consultant rheumatologist at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.

This is because the drugs relax vessels throughout the body – not just the hands and feet — and this increases blood flow to the brain, thus triggering headaches. 

As I’m prone to headaches, I’ve avoided resorting to medication to help my Raynaud’s, but what are the alternatives?

To find out, I asked surgeon Mr Chaloner to assess the latest offerings and rate them on the credibility of science, while I tried them out for myself.

HERBAL PILLS

Padma Circosan, £29.95 for 120 capsules, healthy2u.co.uk

Padma Circosan is a herbal medicine, used for circulatory disorders including Raynaud’s. Ingredients include costus root, Iceland moss and neem fruit, which believed to boost circulation naturally

A herbal medicine, used for circulatory disorders including Raynaud’s. Ingredients include costus root, Iceland moss and neem fruit, which believed to boost circulation naturally. Take two capsules three times a day.

EXPERT VIEW: ‘There’s some evidence that Padma has effects on the chemicals thought to play a part in vascular disease. But there are no direct trials I can find that demonstrate a specific effect in Raynaud’s.’ RATING: 2/5

MY VIEW: I can’t say there was any real change when I was out in cold weather. However, my hands felt a little warmer in the house than they normally do.

MENTHOL PLASTERS

Patch-It Circulation, 20 patches for £29.99, Holland & Barrett

Plaster-style reflexology patches that you stick on the soles of the feet. They contain menthol which, it’s claimed, helps stimulate key reflexology points on the feet to help healthy circulation.

EXPERT VIEW: ‘The menthol in the patch may have a minor beneficial and temporary effect. It seems to affect the fine capillaries creating a minor change in blood flow, so creating a feeling of warmth.’ 2/5

MY VIEW: It’s suggested you wear these for three consecutive nights, but that just left me with a gluey mess on my feet in the morning. Made absolutely no difference.

SOCKS MADE OF SILVER 

Carnation Footcare Silversock, £9.54, silversock.co.uk

Socks made with silver fibre, which, claim manufacturers, improve circulation

EXPERT VIEW: ‘There’s no evidence to support a pharmacological effect of silver as a way of improving circulation. However, there is good clinical evidence that warm clothing does have a beneficial effect on Raynaud’s symptoms, so just on the basis that it is a thick sock, it should be of benefit.’ 3/5

MY VIEW: My feet stayed warm when I was outside, but no more so than when I have worn a decent pair of socks.

HAND WARMERS 

Hothands Hand Warmers — Twin Pack, £1, Halfords

Hothands Hand Warmers: Self-heating little bags that contain ingredients such as iron powder, salt and charcoal, which, due to a chemical reaction, warm up when exposed to the air

Self-heating little bags that contain ingredients such as iron powder, salt and charcoal, which, due to a chemical reaction, warm up when exposed to the air.

EXPERT VIEW: ‘Useful and cheap. I used these when I went mountain climbing.’ 4/5

MY VIEW: These are very effective once they have warmed up — which takes about ten minutes. They stayed warm inside my gloves for three or four hours.

GINKGO POWDER

Hawthorn Ginkgo & Bilberry Powder by Terranova, £18.50 for 30g, nutricentre.com

A blend of hawthorn, ginkgo and bilberry, taken as a quarter teaspoon of powder mixed with water at meal times, once or twice a day. It is claimed that the ingredients naturally maintain healthy circulation.

EXPERT VIEW: ‘There is some evidence ginkgo has an effect on certain chemicals thought to be important in blood vessels. However, ginkgo has been tested in several trials in Raynaud’s disease and been found to be no better than a placebo.’ 1/5

MY VIEW: This smells and tastes horrible. But I did notice that my hands felt a little warmer when I was taking them — but not outside when it was really cold.

HEATED MITTENS

Springyard battery heated mittens, £21.45, primrose.co.uk

Mittens with a pouch on the back of the wrist area that contains a battery-operated heating device.

EXPERT VIEW: ‘These work on the principle of keeping the hands warm. However, they may be a little heavy to wear.’ 4/5

MY VIEW: The device took 20 minutes to heat up — so when I was outside, my hands were already starting to feel cold, though not yet going numb as the wadding in the mittens is quite effective.

TINGLY FOOT BALM

Gehwol Warming Balm, £7.50, beautynaturals.com

Contains algae, paprika, ginger, essential oils of rosemary and lavender as well as camphor, which it’s claimed naturally stimulate the circulation

EXPERT VIEW: ‘It may make your feet feel better briefly as ingredients such as camphor may cause a slight change to the capillaries in the skin. But no evidence offered that it has any significant effect on Raynaud’s.’ 0/5

MY VIEW: This produced a pleasant warming feeling when rubbed into the skin. And (even though it’s for feet) I tried it on my hands and they both felt warm for a while. Not an ideal solution as the cream is a little gloopy and it didn’t ultimately stop my hands from going cold when I went outside, though there was less of a reaction indoors.
