It was a clear, sunny day when Ben Schwartz attempted a death-defying BASE jump off the edge of the 486-ft tall I.B. Perrine Bridge in Idaho.

And although his face may not have betrayed his nerves the sound of his thumping heartbeat recorded by the camera attached to his chest was undeniable.

After psyching himself, he launches into a backward somersault off of the ledge, barrelling towards Snake River below.

The chest-mounted GoPro camera used to record the jump also picked up Schwartz's pounding heartbeat

'I gotta do this before I think about it too much,' he says before counting down and plummeting towards the earth at the 25-second mark of the YouTube video.

As his parachute deploys just seconds later, Mr Schwartz lets out a celebratory cheer as he sails to safety.

'My first attempt at a gainer while BASE jumping,' he wrote on YouTube.

'I was a bit nervous standing on the edge and the chest-mounted GoPro caught my heartbeat increase right before I jumped.'

The entire clip was shot on the new GoPro HD Hero at the I.B. Perrine Bridge in Twin Falls, Idaho. 

The bridge, which is a popular BASE jumping site, measures approximately 1,500ft long and 486ft high.

It is believed to be the only man-made structure in the United States where BASE jumping is allowed year-round without a permit.
