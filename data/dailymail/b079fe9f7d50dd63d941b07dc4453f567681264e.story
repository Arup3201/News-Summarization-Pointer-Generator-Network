Despite a number of high-profile gaffes, Mitt Romney still has the backing of middle-class voters in the race for the White House, according to a poll

Mitt Romney is winning the battle for middle-class voters in the race for the White House despite a string of gaffes.

With even some Republicans turning on their candidate, there is a general perception in Washington that multi-millionaire Mr Romney is out of touch with ordinary Americans who believe he will only help the rich.

But according to a poll, he has a 14 percentage point lead over Barack Obama among middle-class families.

Although Mr Obama leads by three per cent overall in the poll, middle-class voters constitute 54 per cent of the electorate and are the ultimate target group in a presidential election.

They are more inclined to favour the Republicans on a string of crucial issues, the Politico-George Washington University poll revealed.

It found  62 per cent are more likely to believe America is on the wrong track, compared with 34 per cent who say it is heading in the right direction.

They are also more likely than the 
overall electorate to hold an unfavourable view of Mr Obama, with 51 per
 cent holding this view.

On
 specific areas, 61 per cent disapprove of Mr Obama’s handling of 
government spending, and 56 per cent are unimpressed by his handling of 
the economy.

Crucially for Mr Romney, there is little sign of any good economic news on the horizon.

The unemployment rate rose in August 
in five of the ten swing states that should prove crucial in November’s 
election. It dropped in only two of them.

The
 Obama campaign yesterday launched a TV advert condemning Mr Romney 
after he was caught branding Americans who don’t pay tax ‘freeloaders’, 
yet refusing to ‘come clean’ about his own financial arrangements.

Mr
 Romney, who ran private equity firm Bain Capital, has been scorned by 
Democrats for refusing to reveal any tax returns before 2010.

Romney's strong showing in the poll also comes after a series of gaffes on his campaign trail.

Earlier this month, he was forced to 
defend comments secretly recorded at a fundraising event in which he 
said that 47 per cent of Americans are dependent on government... and who 
believe that they are victims'.

He added that 'my job is not to worry about 
those people'.

Last month, he was left red-faced when he confused ‘Sikh’ and ‘Sheikh’ while talking about the massacre at a Wisconsin Sikh temple.

The Republican Presidential candidate twice confused the two terms and referred to the victims as the ‘Shiekh people’ who had been worshipping in a ‘Sheikh temple’.

Sheikh is a Muslim term for the leader of a tribe or village.

He also forced into a humiliating U-turn during this year's Olympics when he said there were 'a few things that were disconcerting' about London hosting the Games.

He was subsequently branded ‘Mitt the Twit’ and ‘Party Pooper’ by the British press and had to use a series of interviews to try to repair his damaged reputation on his first foreign trip as a presidential candidate.

He has also previously been condemned for saying he likes 'being able to fire people who provide services to me'.
