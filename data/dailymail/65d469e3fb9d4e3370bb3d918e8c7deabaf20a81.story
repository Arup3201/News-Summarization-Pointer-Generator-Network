Elvis and Priscilla Presley's luxury love nest in the California desert has just become a little more affordable.

The 4-bedroom, 5-bathroom mansion at 1350 Ladera Circle in Palm Springs, where the King lived with his newlywed wife in May 1967, was put on the market in April with a $9.5million price tag. 

Six months later, the realtors handling the sale of the high-end property, Million Dollar Listing star Josh Altman and his brother Matthew. have shaved a million dollars off the original asking price.

Featured in 'Elvis & Me' and 'Elvis by the Presleys,' the home measuring nearly 5,000 square feet is built in 'four perfect circles, on three levels,' according to its listing page. The home also includes a pool, tennis court and even a stage.

'It's literally a time capsule of Elvis,' Josh Altman told the Journal back in April. 'When I walked into the house, I was all shook up.'

As the story goes, Presley and his wife-to-be had rented the house as a venue for their ceremony and reception, but gossip columnist Rona Barrett who lived nearby became suspicious when she spotted the couple's relatives arriving in droves at the residence.

According to the home's website, the journalist even had a maid working at the house followed to find out when and where the wedding would take place.

When Barrett spilled the beans about the upcoming nuptials on national TV, Elvis and company decided to move their celebration to Las Vegas, with Rat Pack leader Frank Sinatra providing the transportation, including a fleet of limousines and his Lear jet, Christina. 

After saying 'I do' at the Aladdin Hotel in Sin City, the First Couple of Rock 'N Roll hosted a breakfast reception for 100 guests and then returned to Palm Springs to begin their honeymoon. 

According to the site, Elvis carried his new wife across the threshold of the mansion while signing the Hawaiian wedding songs from his film Blue Hawaii.
