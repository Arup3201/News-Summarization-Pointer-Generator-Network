Honey Boo Boo's Uncle Poodle has vowed he will fight for custody of the child reality star if her mother does not end her relationship with a convicted child molester.

Uncle Poodle - real name Lee Thompson - and his fiance Alan plan to file for temporary custody of Honey Boo Boo if Mama June does not completely sever ties with Mark McDaniel. 

According to TMZ, sources have revealed that Uncle Poodle has researched the ground rules for winning temporary custody and he said they are getting a new, larger apartment with a spare bedroom.

The sources say that Uncle Poodle and Alan will not ask for permanent custody because they would like to see Honey Boo Boo's father Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson eventually care for his daughter when he gets back on his feet financially.

The news follows claims that Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star Mama June - real name June Shannon - has rekindled her romance with Mark McDaniel,  who served 10 years behind bars for child molestation.

Mama June has denied the claims that she has been seeing McDaniel, 53, despite damning photographs that show them house hunting together and him hanging out with Honey Boo Boo.

After the images emerged, TLC canceled Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, which has run for four seasons.

At aged nine, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' is a year older than her sister Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell was when she was abused by McDaniel.

Anna claimed he abused her for months in 2002 at the trailer he shared with Mama June - sometimes while sister Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, then three, was forced to watch.

Last week, Pumpkin, now 14, hit out at Uncle Poodle for 'spreading lies' about their family.

In a lengthy rant on her Instagram account 'be_brave14', Pumpkin claimed that Uncle Poodle has been 'selling false stories' and that he had told her he hoped June would get cancer 'and die of a slow painful death'.

However, TMZ reported that Uncle Poodle has responded to Pumpkin, saying: 'The girls will be just fine.

Uncle Poodle - who revealed that he is HIV-positive last year - added: 'They are upset now and will understand the gravity of the situation. All I can do is love them unconditionally regardless of how they currently feel.'

It has been reported that the family are now being investigated by Child Protective Services in Georgia due to the claims against McDaniel.

CPS formally opened an investigation to determine if any crimes have been committed against June Shannon's youngest children - Pumpkin, Jessica 'Chubbs', 17, and Honey Boo Boo - after calls from the public, according to RadarOnline. 

'Social workers will be making formal contact with all of June’s children, and any other minors that might have come into contact with Mark McDaniel,' a CPS source told Radar.

'This is being taken very, very seriously by the department.'

A spokesman for the agency could not confirm the reports, citing privacy laws.
