These tiny matchstick figures may look like characters from a L.S. Lowry painting but they are in fact a group of tourists admiring the vast expanse of Death Valley.

Photographer David Hellard, 46, took the shots as the sun rose over vast, colourful cliffs during a two day expedition in the notorious Californian desert.

The tiny figures give a sense of the scale of the sprawling landscape, which is the lowest and driest area in North America, and the current holder of the world's highest recorded air temperature - 56.7C in July 1913.

Stunning: The tiny matchstick figures in these photographs are in fact a group of tourists admiring the vast expanse of Death Valley. They give a sense of the scale of the sprawling landscape, which is the lowest and driest area in North America and one of the hottest places anywhere on earth

Colours: David Hellard, who doesn't like heights, climbed 650 feet up a steep mountain trail in the Amargosa Range to take his photographs

Light: David Hellard said being scared of heights was actually a benefit to his photographs. 'I really studied the scene. There were a tremendous amount of things to look at, and other people tried moving around to get different views of the same things... I really tried to see what was there,' he said

Mr Hellard, who doesn't like heights, braved a steep climb up a trail to the point from which he took his stunning photographs - 650 feet up a mountain in the Amargosa Range.

He was the only one in his group of five friends to spot a group of Germans touring on Harley Davidson motorbikes below.

'I don't think the people were there when I first started shooting, but I'm not sure... I am not a big fan of heights and was so nervous. The trail we climbed up was steep, narrow, and fell off sharply,' he said.

'While other people felt comfortable moving around and changing position, once I got set up I didnt feel like doing a lot of shuffling... With the winds gusting against my back, I could easily imagine my camera and tripod, my camera bag, or even me tumbling over the edge and straight down,' he added.

'The benefit to this was that I really studied the scene. There were a tremendous amount of things to look at, and other people tried moving around to get different views of the same things... I really tried to see what was there and eventually noticed the tiny figures off to my left and down,' Mr Hellard said.

Observant: The photographer said the rest of his group were too busy focusing on the rolling hills off to the right of the scene to notice the group of tourists gathered below. He, on the other hand, used the sense of calm he'd had to instill in himself just to climb the mountain to maintain focus while taking the photos

Proud: David Hellard said that he thinks each photo tells a unique and different story. He added that he was immensely happy with how well the colours came out and how sharp the photos were. The photographer lives in Los Angeles with wife Sandy

'I took a number of photos of the area while the sun came up. The colours during that time kept shifting and changing, so I was constantly returning to different 'scenes' laid out before me as they varied,' Mr Hellard said.

'The bright and brilliant reds and magentas you see are a result of the morning light. The cliffs are naturally a sort of yellow, lemon colour mixed with browns or darker reds. The variation in the tones is due to the different strata and sediments of the rock itself,' he added.

'Primarily it's really all about the soft morning light and shooting in the 'golden hours'. There was only a short window in which these photos were possible. After the sun rose, the gentle colours were washed away. About
 10 minutes after I took these photos, the rock formations all 
homogenized back to their usual basic browns, yellows and muddy reds, Mr Hellard went on.

Otherworldly: David Hellard took a number of photos of the area while the sun came up. He said the colours during that time kept shifting and changing, so he was constantly witnessing different 'scenes' being laid out before him as the sunlight varied'

New perspective: After taking the photographs, David Hellard, who lives in Los Angeles with wife Sandy, then hiked back down with his friends for breakfast. He said the desert can be disorienting to someone who's used to a horizon of buildings or being surrounded by corn fields

After taking the photographs, Mr Hellard, who lives in Los Angeles with wife Sandy, then hiked back down with his friends for breakfast.

'I loved this area a lot. I've never seen anything quite like it. All of Death Valley is magnificent and there's an 'otherworldly' feeling about it... The area is completely unique and there is no place quite like it on Earth,' he said.

'In general, the desert is sometimes overwhelming and you just can't believe you can see that far, that mountains can be that high or stretch so far into the distance,' he added.

Mr Hellard said the desert can be disorienting to someone who's used to a horizon of buildings or being surrounded by corn fields.

He said that he thinks each photo tells a unique and different story, adding that he was immensely happy with how well the colours came out and how sharp the photos were.

'If I'm going to run the risk of tumbling off the edge, I might as well make it worth it...I think the photos convey the beauty and mystery of the area as well as a sense of serenity and peace,' he said.

Thanks to near-perfect lighting conditions, the images look more like paintings than photographs
