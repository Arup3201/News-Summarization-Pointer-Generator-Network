Bosses at pizza chain Domino’s put up a sign telling workers they could only speak English.

Foreign staff at one takeaway were told they could be sacked for speaking their native tongue.

Managers put up a notice which read: ‘All staff whilst you are working at this store you must speak in English. This is for ease of communication, safety and due to some complaints from staff at other stores.

‘Anybody ignoring this could find disciplinary procedures  followed, as it could be seen as a form of workplace bullying.’

Pizza delivery man Stuart Horton has quit his job over a notice written by a Domino's manager warning staff to speak in English or face disciplinary action

The red and blue felt-tip poster had the word ‘English’ boxed in and written in green.

Employees at the branch in Preston, Lancashire, claimed the policy was discriminatory.

Around
15 staff work at the takeaway and most, including those from Poland, 
Hungary and Asia, do not speak English as a first language.

The franchise is operated by the private firm Topwest Limited.

Area manager David Woods has reportedly agreed to meet staff to discuss concerns.

A 
spokesman for Domino’s Pizza Group PLC said a common language was 
‘vital’ for safety, but agreed the tone of the poster was ‘a little 
strong’ and the firm ‘will be picking this up’.

They said: 'To
ensure a good flow of communication in our stores, the use of a common 
language is spoken at work to avoid confusion and to create a more 
welcoming environment.

'It 
is also paramount that all safety aspects are adhered to and for this 
reason a common language is vital. The tone of the poster shown is a 
little strong and we will be picking this up with the franchisee.'

Angry Stuart Horton, 47, claims he left his job of five years at the Domino's Pizza after the message was written on a staffroom noticeboard

Mature college student Stuart Horton, 47, who has worked part time with the firm for five years said around 15 staff worked at the branch, the majority of whom do not speak English as a first language.

Among them are Asian, Polish and Hungarian workers.

Mr Horton who is studying for a community policing and justice management degree said: 'The notice was on there for about a week. It was long enough to strike fear among people.

'It shocked me and angered me. I’m aware of the health and safety act and having to speak English doesn’t feature in any law.

'The manager took the staff on in the first place knowing full well their native tongues are from different regions and they are trying to learn English.

'Some of them have a basic grasp of English but it isn’t a problem and there isn’t a communication barrier. Everybody speaks English if talking to customers or answering the phone.

'I don’t feel comfortable in that work environment. I’m not being part of an organisation that adopts this stance.

'Domino’s Pizza have been operating in the area for a long time. We have a lot of customers of different ethnic backgrounds and staff of different ethnic backgrounds and migrant workers.'

The branch is one of many Domino’s Pizza franchises across Lancashire operated by Topwest Limited.
