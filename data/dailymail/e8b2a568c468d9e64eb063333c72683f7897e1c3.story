Serena Williams took some time away from tennis to show off her new diamond-encrusted watch, after the 18-time grand slam champion enjoyed a win in her opening match of the WTA Finals.

Williams posted a picture wearing the Audemars Piguet Ladies' Millenary Rose Gold watch, worth $73,000 (£45,000), to her Instagram account on Tuesday.

The American World No 1 also posted 'Diamonds are a girls best friend. #audemarspiguet #millenary'

Serena Williams was given a tough match by Ana Ivanovic in the opening game of the WTA Finals on Monday

Williams is currently in Singapore defending her WTA Finals title, and began well with a 6-4 6-4 win over Ana Ivanovic on Monday.

It comes after a week of controversy, during which the Russian Tennis Federation president Shamil Tarpischev has been forced to publicly apologise for his slur Serena and her sister, Venus.

Williams plays a forehand during her straight sets, but not straightforward, victory in Singapore on Monday

Russian Tennis Federation president Shamil Tarpischev has been fined £15,500 and banned from women's tennis for one year following his 'Williams brothers' remark about Venus and Serena on a TV talk show

The International Tennis Federation came under fire from Martina Navratilova on Monday for failing to act after Tarpischev described the Williams' as 'brothers'.

The Womens' Tennis Association responded swiftly to Tarpischev's remarks by banning him for a year and issuing a fine of 25,000 US dollars (£15,500).

And Serena herself said the comments 'very insensitive and extremely sexist as well as racist at the same time.'
