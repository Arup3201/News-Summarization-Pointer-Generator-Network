Clean-living pop star Ellie Goulding has had a sobering reminder to wear bright clothes while exercising.

The Burn singer injured herself after crashing into a builder while out for an early morning run dressed in grey jogging gear and a beanie hat.

A friend of the star explains: ‘Ellie suffered a cut lip, hurt her leg and was also shaken up.'

Ouch! Ellie Goulding crashed into a man while out jogging due to the fact that she wore dark clothing, so the man did not see her

'She doesn’t like drawing attention to herself when she’s running but this has taught her that it’s better to be seen than to be injured.

‘Ellie jogs four or five times a week, does the Insanity fitness DVD and  attends Barry’s Bootcamp classes, and she can’t keep that up if she’s getting  silly injuries.’

Let’s hope Ellie won’t be out of action for too long.

Safety selfie: App Eyenaemia, helps provide an early aid to diagnosis of anaemia (stock image)

The craze for selfies is  being harnessed in the battle against anaemia.

A new phone app, Eyenaemia, helps provide an early aid to diagnosis of the condition, in which the number of red blood cells is reduced. A picture of the eyes can be emailed to a doctor, who will order blood tests if there is a positive result.

Examining body parts that should be blood-red, such  as the eyelids and gums, can provide the first clues in the diagnosis of anaemia, which is typically caused by  an iron deficiency.

Migraine could be eased with meditation,  say researchers.

Staff at the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in North Carolina  looked at the effects of yoga and meditation known as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in adults suffering from migraines.

The MBSR participants had fewer and less severe episodes than those in the control group. The findings are published online by the journal Headache.

Heart attack patients often 
assume that they’re in the clear if they suffer no  ill-effects after 12
 months, but  a new study reveals they need to maintain vigilance.

The
 research, commissioned by drugs giant AstraZeneca and presented at the 
European Society of Cardiology last month, looked at 10,000 UK 
heart-attack survivors.

It found that one in five who had been free of effects for a year will 
go on to have another event such as a heart attack or stroke within the 
next three years.
