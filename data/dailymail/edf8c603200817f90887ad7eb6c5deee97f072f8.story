Family doctors should start prescribing gardening to patients, a Government health advisor will say today.

Dr William Bird, who advises Public Health England on physical activity, says the NHS should acknowledge the power of the great outdoors as a medical treatment.

The expert, who has 30 years’ experience as a GP in Reading, will today call for fellow doctors to start using community gardening schemes to tackle disease.

Addressing the Royal Horticultural Society in London tomorrow evening, Dr Bird will outline recent evidence that suggests contact with green space can have a dramatic impact on health.

Speaking to the Daily Mail before his speech, he claimed every £1 spent on access to community outdoor schemes could save the health service £5 in other treatments.

Dr Bird said: ‘We are programmed as humans to be hunter gatherers, to live outdoors, we are not really adapted to urban life.

‘A dose of green space, really connecting people back to nature, can make a huge difference.

‘Blood pressure reduces, muscle tension reduces, all of these happen within moments of going into a park or a garden.

‘Reducing stress has been shown to make a significant difference in all kinds of ways.’

He added: ‘Horticultural or garden therapy includes a broad range of treatment options in various kinds of settings, spanning from care of single plants to walks in wilderness areas.

‘Even indoor plants have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mental health.’

One group of GPs in Newham, East London, has started funding placements for 12-week ‘community prescription’ outdoor exercise programmes for those at risk of type two diabetes.

Dr Bird, who also advises the World Health Organisation, called for similar programmes to be funded for other outdoor schemes including walking groups and gardening programmes.

Gardening, country runs or simply a stroll in the park can have a dramatic impact on health, he said.

Dementia, type two diabetes and heart disease can be both prevented and treated with outdoor therapy, he said.

Studies have shown that the stress-relieving impact of access to nature is profound, playing an obvious role in improving mental health.

Green spaces also increase physical activity, reducing the risk of obesity, type two diabetes and heart disease.

And stimulating senses such as touch, smell and hearing in the garden has been shown to be an effective therapy for dementia patients.

Dr Bird said doctors have not yet accepted that something so simple can be more effective than drugs.

Outlining evidence that nature has a profound impact on the body and mind, he said: ‘If gardening and a drug have the same effect as drugs on prevention of diabetes, for example, they should be compared objectively rather than choosing the drug simply because it is more familiar in the NHS.

‘There are considerable savings to be made if we really managed to get horticulture therapy up to the standard of other health interventions - then we could see benefits of at least £5 health benefit for every £1 spent.’

Dr Bird will be joined on stage tonight by Dr Matilda Van Den Bosch, a Swedish researcher who has looked at the impact of green space on mental and physical health.

Her research, published in the journal Physiology and Behaviour, suggests the sounds of nature alone - wind whistling through the trees and a bubbling stream - reduces levels of the stress hormone cortisol in humans.

A second study by Dr Van Den Bosch, published in the Scandinavian Journal of Public Health, concluded that simply giving people access to green space could help reduce the impact of a range of diseases.

Her paper, which summarised 38 separate pieces of clinical research, said: ‘Significant improvements were found for varied outcomes in diverse diagnoses, spanning for obesity to schizophrenia.

‘Nature-assisted therapy [is] a relevant resource for public health.’

Scientists have long known that chronic stress increases risk of heart disease and stroke.

But there is a growing school of thought that stress can also increase inflammation of cells, which is thought to play a role in diabetes and dementia.

Dr Van Den Bosch, from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, said: ‘Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, mental health problems - these are not easy problems to treat.

‘It is much more effective to act earlier to stop them occurring in the first place, and access to green spaces can do that.’
