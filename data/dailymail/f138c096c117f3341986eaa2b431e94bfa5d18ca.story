Astronauts who flew to 45,00ft to help launch the doomed Virgin Galactic spaceplane that malfunctioned in mid-air today saw the explosion that killed one of their friends, it was claimed.

One pilot for the embattled space tourism company was killed when SpaceShipTwo, the advanced plane meant to take passengers into sub-orbital flight, came apart seconds after its mid-air launch.

Rick 'CJ' Sturckow was one of the pilots flying the WhiteKnightTwo launching craft, MailOnline can reveal - and so would have been with the killed pilot - still unnamed - minutes before the disaster.

Disaster: One pilot parachuted from the exploding plane, but was still seriously injured. The other died. Neither were named

SpaceShipTwo's engines had kicked in after it detached from WhiteKnightTwo, a twin-hulled airplanes which carried SpaceShipTwo to launch altitude. Two minutes after the split, it malfunctioned, killing one crewmember.

Another man parachuted out of the plane, but was seriously injured in the crash and is now in hospital.

Speaking to MailOnline today, a family friend revealed how relieved family members have been sharing the news that their loved on is safe. 

Carol Massa, 72, a family friend of the Sturckows, lives  next door to his 78-year-old mother, Jeanette in San Diego, California.

Fragments: Chunks of plane rained down from the sky after the mid-air explosion, which killed a pilot

She said: 'I have no idea who the pilot was that died I just know that Rick is indeed alive and well, thank God.

'They assured us that Rick was not the one that crashed. She [Jeanette] certainly is very relieved.

'Jeanette's daughter called to speak to his wife Michelle and she reassured them Rick was fine.

'They called to speak to his wife this morning. It's a scary business he's in.

'I think Rick was flying in the other craft that was flying. He was following in the other spacecraft.

'I suspect he would have seen it but I do not know how far apart they would have been.

'I'm sure Rick knows who this pilot is, because there's a small group of them. His name has not been released.' 

The flight had taken off at 9:30am local time and the two craft had separated at 10:10am. A problem was discovered two minutes later.

After releasing SpaceShipTwo, WhiteKnightTwo simply glides back to earth. 

'That was pretty scary, I guess it's going to set their whole project back a bit', Mrs Massa said, adding she last saw him about a year ago before he moved up to live closer to the Mojave base.

She said Sturckow would not mind if he died piloting a spacecraft as he loves his job so much, in his spare time she said his passion is farming.

She said: 'Rick is an adrenaline junkie, he can't sit still.

'Janette knows that Rick would not want to be doing anything else. Rick's theory is if he dies in a spacecraft or gets hauled off his tractor either way is fine because he loves doing both of those things.'

She said Rick's family have learned to deal with his dangerous profession over the years, adding: 'They are used to the worry because he's an astronaut, it's just one of those things, you have to go on with life. They have to have that attitude or you go crazy. They just pray he will be OK.'
