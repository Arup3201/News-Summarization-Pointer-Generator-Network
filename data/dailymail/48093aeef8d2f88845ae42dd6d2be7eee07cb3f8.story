Rory McIlroy said he was ready for anything thrown at him by the elements as the organisers of The Open prepare to batten down the hatches on Saturday.

The brilliant Northern Irishman shot another 66 — despite the intervention of a pheasant at the eighth hole — to open up a four-shot halfway lead at Royal Liverpool.

The weather might be the one thing that can stop McIlroy.

Almost there: McIlroy has reached the halfway stage ahead of the chasing pack

The forecast is so bad that organisers have already instigated the first two-tee start in the 154-year history of the event, with play due to begin at 9am.

‘I feel like I am ready for whatever conditions come,’ said the 25-year-old. ‘I just felt an inner peace on the course. Why? I think it was something to do with feeling in complete control of my game.’

He might have banished freaky Fridays in terms of scores but there was still something freakish about the day, when he backed off his birdie putt as a pheasant walked across the green.

‘I’ve never seen that before,’ said McIlroy, smiling. Even the birdie couldn’t stop the birdie, though. McIlroy regrouped and rolled in the putt.
