Whodunnit? He did: Joe Miller, played by actor Matthew Gravelle, was revealed as the killer of 11-year-old schoolboy Danny Latimer on the television programme

Almost 9million armchair sleuths tuned in to see Broadchurch’s dramatic final episode.

But while the show started with 8.8million viewers, it tailed off to 7.9million after 15 minutes once Joe Miller was revealed as the killer of 11-year-old schoolboy Danny Latimer.

The average figure for Monday’s show was 8.4million – more than a million up from last week’s 6.9million viewers.

Even though his character was an unlikely suspect, actor Matthew Gravelle, who played Miller, says he was stopped on the school run yesterday morning by parents claiming they knew it was him all along.

In fact the bigger surprise was the announcement of a second series. The episode ended with the caption ‘Broadchurch will return’.

One viewer, Simon Bromley, tweeted: ‘I wasn’t expecting that.’

The eight-part drama starred David Tennant and Olivia Colman as detectives on the hunt for the killer of the 11-year-old schoolboy, whose body was found at the foot of a cliff in the picturesque Dorset village of Broadchurch.

Viewers hit a peak of 9.3million on Monday as the murderer was 
eventually revealed to be Joe Miller - 
the husband of Colman's character, Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller.

The
 climax was kept such a closely guarded secret that only 29 people - all
 of whom were cast, crew or executives - knew the identity of the killer
 before the final episode, it was reported by The Guardian.

Actor Matthew Gravelle, 37, admitted 
he left it as late as possible to go on the school run after he was 
revealed as the murderer.

But parents were waiting at the schoolgates to see the TV killer in the flesh.

Matthew
 said: 'I tried to leave it as late as possible before running up to the
 school and dropping the children off and running back.

It's back: ITV have confirmed that the hit show will return to screens for a second series - but it may not involve a murder, it has emerged

Olivia Lawrence: 'After watching the final episode of #Broadchurch I am emotionally drained. I feel absolutely exhausted!'

Matthew Robb ‏: 'Broadchurch is the best drama i have ever seen on British TV. Production, Acting, Storyline, all top notch! #broadchurch.'

Roman Lukyanov ‏: '#broadchurch should be left well alone. There is nowhere for a 2nd season to go. Unless its Tennant in Sandbrook, which could work.'

Chloe Shields ‏: 'catching up on last nights broadchurch....wasnt expecting that #wow #shocker #broadchurch #itv

JohnHenryDictaphone: 'Argh! The last 10 minutes of #Broadchurch didn't need to happen. All the suspense building to rapidly tumble to Greenaway-esk flame fantasy'

antanddec ‏@antanddec: 'Just finished watching @ITV #broadchurch. Just brilliant. Well done to everyone involved, fantastic telly. Phew! So glad it's returning!'

Alan Carr: 'Must admit that massive asteroid landing on #broadchurch destroying the whole community was a bit of a lame ending.'

Phillip Schofield: 'Wow #broadchurch' 

'A couple of parents stopped me to let me know they had known it was me - but no one tried to push me over.'

Former Holby City actor Matthew lives with his actress wife Mali Harries and their children Ela, eight, and Tomi, five, in Cardiff.

And it was the confrontation in the playground which made him realise just how Broadchurch had affected the nine million viewers.

Matthew said: 'Up until the point I was revealed as the killer I'd been a house-husband and general nice bloke. Now it is different.'

Matthew admitted he has been left anxious after his character Joe Miller confessed to killing Danny Latimer.

He was one of eight potential suspects in the ITV series which has gripped the nation.

But Matthew only discovered he was the Broadchurch killer two weeks before the filming ended.

The concluding episode drew an average 
audience of 8.8 million viewers - a 33 per cent share of viewing, the 
highest rating episode of the series by one million.

Now ITV have confirmed the hit show will get a second series next year, but, as with the first, details of the story, 
and which characters will return, are currently being kept tightly under
 wraps.

Since launching on March 4, the drama has become the biggest whodunnit of the year, attracting an average weekly audience of more than nine million.

Ambushed in the playground: Matthew Gravelle, who played Joe Miller, said he was told by parents at his children's school today that they always knew his character was the killer

The first episode rating of 9.1million (31 per cent audience share) saw Broadchurch achieve the highest
 weekday launch of a new drama across all broadcasters since ITV's 
Whitechapel in January 2009.

Only two other dramas on television 
launching during weekday have rated higher since 2002, both from ITV, 
Life Begins and Doc Martin.

Based on live overnight data, 
Broadchurch has captivated an average audience 7.1 million viewers 
across its eight-part run, making it the most-watched new drama series 
on any channel in over a year, according to ITV.

Based
 on consolidated data, which includes 'plus 1' channels and catch-up TV,
 Broadchurch is currently averaging 9.2 million viewers, meaning it is 
on track to be ITV's highest-rating new weekday drama series since 2004.

The compelling series, produced by 
Kudos Film and Television, which also starred, Jodie Whittaker, Andrew 
Buchan, Vicky McClure, Arthur Darvill, David Bradley, Pauline Quirke, 
Jonathan Bailey, Carolyn Pickles and Will Mellor, had bookmakers running
 odds on who they thought was responsible for Danny's death.

Commissioned for ITV by Acting 
Director of Drama Commissioning, Steve November, Broadchurch is 
executive produced by Chris Chibnall, and Kudos Film and Television's 
Jane Featherstone.

The series was produced by Richard 
Stokes and the lead director was James Strong. Euros Lyn also directed 
three episodes of the series.

'We're delighted to be commissioning a second series of Broadchurch,' said ITV's Director of Television, Peter Fincham.

'From the moment the murder scene was
 discovered, viewers became gripped by the series, and we've been 
genuinely thrilled by the audience response. David and Olivia's 
performances and Chris's cleverly crafted scripts have created a truly 
compelling drama.'

Creator and writer Chris Chibnall 
said: 'The whole Broadchurch team has been delighted and properly 
gobsmacked by the response from ITV viewers.

'When I first talked to Peter Fincham
 and Laura Mackie, ITV's Director of Drama about Broadchurch, I 
mentioned that if people liked it, there was another very different 
story we could tell afterwards. I'm really thrilled we're going to tell 
that story too.'

Executive producer, Jane Featherstone
 for Kudos Film and Television commented: 'It's such a privilege for 
Kudos to be able to work with Chris and ITV to bring the next chapter of
 Broadchurch to our screens.

'And although we're giving nothing away right now, I can tell you it's going to keep on delivering surprises and scale.'
