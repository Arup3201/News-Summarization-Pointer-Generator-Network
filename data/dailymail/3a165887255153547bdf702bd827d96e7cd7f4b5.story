A toothless saboteur wearing a Led Zeppelin t-shirt is suspected of deliberately creating obstacles along forest trails which has injured dirt bike riders in Queensland.

Queensland police are hunting for the man, described as in his 40s, who is believed to have been placing rocks and logs in dangerous spots om the Nerang State Forest.

Police released a comfit image of a man who is missing his front teeth and has been spotted acting suspiciously in the Nerang State Forest area. He is described as Caucasian, aged in his 40s, with dark short hair and a solid build

Police say several riders have been hurt after hitting the strategically-placed objects left in the area located inland from the Gold Coast.

'The items placed on the bike trail appear to be strategically placed to force riders to either crash into them or crash whilst avoiding them,' Senior Sergeant Peter Gordon said on Wednesday.

Sgt Gordon said the person responsible could face serious charges, given riders had suffered injuries.

He was said to be wearing a black Led Zeppelin t-shirt, black shorts, a black cap and sunglasses at the time.

Meanwhile, the peculiar behaviour has sparked discussion on the dirtbikeride.net website with one rider saying that he suspects the offender had also been sabotaging tracks in Bellthorpe, north of the Gold Coast

'I got injured on the weekend by a slippery log left across a track,' Sambo posted.

While other dirt bike rider commented that the obstacles were all part of the fun on the tracks.

'You would think he'd notice the two foot high logs I'd been riding over, twigs ain't gonna slow me down much ' one said.

And another agreed saying: 'I ride Nerang twice a week , I would think mother nature does more sabotage to the tracks than that bloke'.
