After a fairytale proposal, Lacey Maclean couldn’t wait to tell the world her good news.

‘Most perfect moment ever … Can’t wait to be Mrs Newby’, the 23-year-old wrote on Twitter, posting a photograph of her footballer fiance Kris Newby down on one knee.

Two months on, she took to the social networking site again – with some rather different news.

Accusations: Kris Newby proposing to his then fiance Lacey Maclean, who has claimed he used her money for gambling

Happier times: Pictured on the day they got engaged, it was just weeks later before Lacey Maclean began accusing Kris Newby of taking her money

In an extraordinary series of 
messages, Miss Maclean claimed her fiance had stolen £12,000 from her to
fund a devastating gambling addiction, leaving their relationship in 
tatters.

Last night Mr Newby, 25, publicly 
apologised to his ex-girlfriend as he admitted he was seeking help for 
his ‘spiralling’ addiction to high stakes slot machines, which have been
described as the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’.

Mr Newby, a winger for 
semi-professional East Thurrock United in Essex, proposed to Miss 
Maclean in front of their friends at a black-tie dinner in January.

Miss Maclean immediately posted 
photographs of the moment on Twitter. She wrote: ‘Can’t believe  
@Newby1988 asked me to marry him.. :-) cnt stop smiling xx I love you 
kris xx.’

HEARTBREAK PLAYED OUT ON TWITTER

Lacey Maclean says the footballer is 'scum' and he has publicly apologised to her and her family

But on Sunday night, Miss Maclean 
took to the social networking site again – this time claiming Mr Newby 
had stolen all her money and jewellery to feed his gambling addiction. 

In a string of angry tweets, Miss 
Maclean, who lives with her parents in Tilbury, Essex, wrote: ‘Kris 
Newby is a liar, thief and gambler. He has taken over £12,000 of my 
money and jewellery – be aware.

‘The man I was going to marry has 
robbed me. He has gambled it all. [The] reason I’ve put it on here is so
everyone knows who he really is. He is nothing but scum.’

Yesterday, Mr Newby, a promising 
footballer who scored three times in the FA Cup this year, admitted he 
was addicted to casino-style fixed-odds betting machines.

The machines, which were introduced 
in 2001 under the previous Labour government, allow players to gamble as
much as £100 at a time in games such as virtual roulette.

Footballer Kris Newby has apologised to Miss Maclean, and says he was too proud to admit that he had a problem before

He said: ‘For the past couple of 
years I’ve been hooked on competitive gambling. I thought I had sorted 
it out but I fell back into it four or five months ago and it started 
spiralling out of control.

‘I was too proud to admit I had a problem, and that did not help.’ 

He added: ‘I’ve hurt a lot of people 
as a result, but most of all Lacey, and I’d like to publicly apologise 
to her and her family and anyone else I’ve hurt.

Mr Newby reportedly said he became addicted to roulette machines

'I’ve never been addicted to drugs, but this is worse than drugs – in three seconds you have lost £100. It ruins lives.’ 

Mr Newby, from Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, said his doctor had referred him to a gambling clinic.

Yesterday his grandmother, Peggy Passfield, defended the footballer –  even though she said he had stolen money from her, too.

The 85-year-old said she believed his
problem began when he was a boy, and his father and grandfather would 
let him play on slot machines while they watched the football. 

‘With a start like that, you can understand his addiction,’ she said.

‘I don’t excuse what Kris has done, 
he’s done some terrible things including the way he’s treated Lacey, but
they aren’t right in what they’ve done to him too. 

‘They shouldn’t be putting it all on the internet. He needs help.

‘People may say I’m mad and to be 
honest Kris has robbed me blind too but deep down he’s a good lad, he’s 
just ill and he needs help. If nobody else will stick up for him, I 
will.’ 

John Coventry, manager of East 
Thurrock, said: ‘We’re trying to support Kris even though we have had 
our own problems with him. We now realise the extent of his addiction 
and will do what we can.’

Miss Maclean’s mother, Andrea,  said:
‘Lacey just wants to put the whole thing behind her and move on. We do 
not want to comment on it.’ 

Essex Police said they had not received a complaint and were not investigating.
