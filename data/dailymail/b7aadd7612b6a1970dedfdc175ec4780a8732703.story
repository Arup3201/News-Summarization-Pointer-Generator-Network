Barcelona continued their perfect start to the season in La Liga with a comprehensive win over bottom side Levante.

After being held out for 34 minutes the visitors finally got themselves ahead through Neymar, who rounded the keeper and slotted home with ease, following a sumptuous ball over the top from Lionel Messi -  his five assist of the season already.

Five minutes later Barcelona had the opportunity to extend their lead with that man Messi again the architect, closing in on goal before being hacked down by both Loukas Vyntra and Tono Garcia - however bizarrely only the former got the red card despite both of them involved in the altercation.

To cap a remarkable few minutes Messi then smashed the penalty over the bar as the score remained 1-0 to the visitors.

The floodgates opened after that though with goals from Ivan Rakitic, Sandro, Pedro and Messi completed the rout and kept the Catalan giants top of La Liga.

See how the action panned out below 

 

Host commentator

Perhaps it was a harsh sending off, but Barcelona have torn Levante apart here. Five different scorers and a continuation of their 100 per cent start to the season.

Malaga away next up for Luis Enrique's men on Wednesday night.

Having been anonymous for 30 minutes, Lionel Messi has been superb since and deserved his sublime goal. He has harried every Levante man on the ball and not wasted a single pass. World class.

Mathieu is found at the far post by Xavi, but his cut back goes just wide as Pedro attempts to get there before the post. Perhaps he could have scored there...

Barca just knocking the ball about now like it's an exhibition game. Real hit Deportivo for EIGHT yesterday, and this hasn't been a weekend to claim La Liga is competitive.

Easy. What a goal by Messi, who chips the goalkeeper and defender with his right foot. 357 goals for Barcelona and this one looks like the other 356 others.

Jesus comes too far out of his area and made up the little man's mind for him, but it's still a great finish.

A clean sheet is all Luis Enrique will want now to keep up their 100 per cent record this season for the team of Soleros...

Andres Iniesta, quietely effective tonight, comes off for Sergi Roberto

Mathieu, who in truth has been dodgy today, slices a clearance as the ball falls to Morales. But the Levante man's weak shot trickles wide. It's quiet inside the ground as Messi piles into the area.

He is brought down by Simao, but it was more of a shoulder barge as Gonzales Gonzales waves play on. 

The floodgates are well and truly open, as predicted. 

Great football on the left as Sandro flicks the ball to Alba. The left-back's pace takes him away from the Levante defence and the cut back to Pedro, who slots home from eight yards.

Four zip. And it will probably be more.

Two in two for young Spaniard Sandro Ramirez

Messi gets through two on one with Sandro to his left... he slides the ball through to the youngster and he slides the ball past Jesus. Very much like Mesut Ozil's finish against Aston Villa yesterday.

Sandro hit the winner against APOEL in midweek having come on as a sub, too. He looks a prospect.

Levante have had a bit of the ball since Neymar went off, and they have a free-kick on the edge of the area. The referee DOES have spray on him this time!

But Diop's free-kick hits the wall. The ball goes out of play after Jordi Alba is hit by Simao's flailing arm. 

Uh oh, the Brazilian is on a heap off the pitch but Barca have played on.

When the ball eventually goes out of play, we see how Neymar stretched to keep the ball in play and landed on his backside. It may be THAT back injury... but the medical staff won't let him back on despite him being back on his feet.

Sandro comes on to replace him.

Neat footwork in the area from Alba and Messi ends with Iniesta, who curls over from the corner of the box.

Oh, and it's pouring down in Valencia. 

 

Levante, their centre-back Vyntra sent off, have no defenders on the bench. It's going to be a long 45 minutes.

Here's the moment Messi was brought down in the area by both Vyntra and Tono. The former saw red.

And the floodgates have opened. What a goal from Ivan Rakitic. His first for the club as the ball falls to him 25 yards out. He thumps it into the corner past Jesus, who has absolutely no chance.

The replay shows it may have slightly touched the defender, but nonetheless, that is a hit. 

In an attempt to clear things up... here we go.

Both Vyntra and Tono tackled Messi in the area, but only one was given the red card. A mad decision but Pedro Gonzales Gonzales has had a crazy evening already.

With 10 men, surely Barcelona will open the floodgates will open.

Messi MISSES the penalty... he's hit it high and wide! Unbelievable few minutes.

Bemusement in Valencia... Vyntra is sent off despite it looking like Tono who pulled him down!

Iniesta finds Messi in the area, the Argentine controls it, gets in between two defenders and is fouled.

Clear penalty.

Messi's fifth assist of the season. He really is becoming the new king of the perfectly weighted through ball in Xavi's absence. 

Every goal Barcelona have scored this season has been made or scored by Messi.

Messi, who I was just about to say had done nothing in the game, plays a wonderful ball over the top for Neymar, who gets in just before the keeper, rounds him and slots home. 

Goalkeeper Jesus did get a touch to Neymar's initial touch around him, but couldn't deflect the ball clear, and Barcelona finally have their opener.

The Brazilian's third goal of the season.

Iniesta rather disappointingly produces a 'hit and hope' effort looking for a deflection, and the game has settled as Levate look to keep the ball. 

Barca will want a goal before half-time to hurt Levante. You get the feeling one would open the floodgates...

Last year's top scorer for Levante, Barral, heads just wide after a fine cross into the area. Bravo was rooted to the spot and the hosts could easily be 2-0 up. 

Saying that, a very open game at both ends so far.

At the other end, Mascherano floats a long ball over the defence and Neymar bravely gets up ahead of the goalkeeper but heads wide. Unlucky.

Neymar gets charged in the back by Rodas with the ball miles away, just like his injury at the World Cup.

He's down for 30 seconds but gets back up, and then with his next touch flicks the ball over a Levante defender's head. Beautiful.

Back to the football...

The ball falls to Neymar in the area at a slight angle and with not much space. The Brazilian tries to spash the ball past Jesus, but the keeper saves well. A dink over the onrushing Jesus would have done nicely there...

Match official Pedro Gonzales Gonzales has dropped his cannister of vanishing spray TWICE, and then, unbelievably, he throws it onto the sideline. He's done with it. No more fun in the defensive wall. 

So good they named him twice.

Jordi Alba is in acres of space inside the area on the left, and his cross-cum-shot evades Pedro and goes out for a throw in. Too powerful and erratic from Alba. He'll be disappointed with that.

Mathieu dives in on Morales but misses the ball, he didn't need to go to ground! Morales skips past him and looks for the far post, but Rakitic does so well to clear the ball before a Levante man got on the end of it. Poor from Mathieu, brilliant from Rakitic.

0-0 after 10 minutes. When current Levante coach Mendilibar faced Barça last season his Osasuna lost 7-0 so, so far so good.

Mathieu gets himself into trouble as Morales picks up a loose ball in the centre circle... he paces forward but Alba comes back to clear for a corner to Levante.

The corner finds its way to Morales, whose volley goes a few yards wide.

Corner for Barca after Alba's centre is cleared. Pedro's header is awful, and goes straight back to corner taker Rakitic. The ball goes up the other end and Bravo has to rush off his line in Neuer-esque fashion to clear out for a throw in.

Diop has a go from 18 yards, but it's weak and into the arms of Bravo. 

Alba puts a disappointing ball into the box from the left in space, cleared by Tono inside the area. The Spaniard then puts another poor ball into the box, but Barcelona have plenty of time on the ball.

Early corner for Barca finds its way to Dani Alves, who pulls back for Mathieu, but his effort with the outside of the foot is deflected wide for another corner. 

Perhaps Mathieu could have stroked that one, rather than attempt a clever effort. The resulting corner comes to nothing before Neymar is thwarted on a forward run.

And they're off! Everyone tipping Barcelona at 2-11, Levante are at 14-1. We'll see how that turns out...

The form guide suggests Barcelona will win this easily, with Levante struggling so far this season and Barca turning on the style. 

The teams are just about to come out, with Iniesta leading Barcelona in their fluorescent kit, looking more like 11 Soleros than a football team. Levante, of course, play in Barcelona's famous red and blue.
