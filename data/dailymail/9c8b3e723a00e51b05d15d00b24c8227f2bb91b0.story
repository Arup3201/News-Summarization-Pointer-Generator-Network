A council is to spend £500,000 on upgrading its pavements to try and tackle the obesity crisis.

Nottinghamshire council says there is some evidence that better pavements encourage people to use them more.

But residents in the county are baffled by the council's priorities, questioning why so much money is being spent on improving adequate pavements, and how the council thinks better walkways will help tackle the growing problem of obesity.

Big problem: The East Midlands has the worst levels of obesity in the country. Nottinghamshire Council hopes improving its pavements will help tackle the problem

Emma McFarlane, 68, of Stapleford, said: 'We hear that money is tight, so why is the council spending money on pavements that are all right?'

She added: 'How will that help obese people get fit anyway?'

Her skepticism was also shared by Jo Eftekhari, who runs the Stapleford branch of Slimming World.

'Improving the pavements isn’t the first thing that I would think of when it came to ways to beat obesity,' she said.

Councils across the country were awarded grants earmarked for improving roads and pavements as part of a government scheme. Extreme weather in recent years has left many roads and walkways needing repairs, left with cracks and potholes.

In Nottinghamshire's case, the council was given £1.5million to improve roads and £500,000 for its walkways.

A council spokesman told the Mail Online that this amount was just a 'drop in the ocean' compared to what was needed to improve the entirety of the council's pavements.

Therefore, councillors decided to prioritise improvements where levels of obesity were highest, in a bid to encourage people to walk more, as opposed to drive.

The spokesman said: 'There's evidence to suggest that where that has been implemented before it has been associated with a better use of pavements.'

He said that when pavements near schools have been improved, there was 'anecdotal evidence' to suggest that more parents were walking their children to school.

He said that the 'bottom line' was that the council 'hoped it would encourage healthy lifestyles'.

People in the East Midlands are officially the fattest in Britain, with more hospital admissions for obesity-related illnesses than anywhere else in the country.

The council's public health department drew up a list of areas in Nottinghamshire where levels of obesity were highest.

The Nottinghamshire district of Bassetlaw had the most obesity-linked hospital admissions with 2,878 per 100,000 people last year. However, this district is not on the list for improvements.

Councillors selected five areas with the highest incidence of obesity, coupled with the highest need of walkways repairs, and decided to improve the pavements in these areas. They are: Eastwood, Brinsley, Stapleford, East Retford, Central Newark.

Andy Warrington, the county council’s service director for highways, said: 'It’s all about encouraging people to lead healthier lifestyles and is part of a wider package.'

Opposition spokesman for highways and transport Richard Jackson said: 'I support the investment in pavements, but don’t think it will have the desired outcome of tackling obesity.'

Work will now begin to identify footpaths to local schools and shops that need revamping to encourage people to walk more using obesity prevalence data and footway condition surveys.
