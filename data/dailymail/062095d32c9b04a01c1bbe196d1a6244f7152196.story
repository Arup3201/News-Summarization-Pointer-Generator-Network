Up to 40 vehicles were involved in a pile-up on the Interstate 90 near Cleveland in treacherous winter conditions.

The series of accidents closed an 11-mile stretch of the road on Tuesday after snow and ice made driving conditions extremely hazardous.

The crashes took place just before noon near the city of Painesville, about 30 miles east of Cleveland.

Several police, fire and ambulance crews attended the scene. There were no reports of any serious injuries.

Canada has also been hit by severe weather, with thousands left without power following a winter storm in the Toronto area.

A storm that
 ripped through Ontario caused downed power lines which cut off 
electricity to more than 300,000 customers, 200,000 in Toronto.

About 100 trucks were called in from other cities to help restore power in the area.

The bitter cold in the area also caused the city to open a dozen warming centers.
