Taxpayers are having to foot a £36,000 bill from the headhunters who secured the services of incoming BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead, it has emerged.

The money was paid to executive search firm Saxton Bampfylde – which employs the wife of the BBC’s Director-General, Tony Hall – to ‘define the scope of the role and identify the best candidates’.

The bill, which represents just under a third of the £110,000 salary Mrs Fairhead will be paid for a three- to four-day week, was described last night by one MP on the Commons Media Select Committee as a ‘ridiculous waste of money’.

Mrs Fairhead was grilled by the committee last week, during which MPs quizzed her on her controversial business career, including the role she performed at HSBC when the bank faced a Mexican money-laundering scandal.

She was also asked about her ownership of £5million of shares in Pearson, which has a long-standing contract with a BBC-owned company to produce educational products including books. 

She said she would sell the shares if there was perceived to be a conflict of interest. 

Separately, Government sources have told The Mail on Sunday they are ‘confident’ Mrs Fairhead will ‘address the problem of the BBC’s ingrained, institutional bias to the left’.

With just eight months until the Election, it is understood that Mrs Fairhead has given private assurances that she both ‘understands the importance of impartiality and the perception of impartiality’.

Mrs Fairhead will also lead the hugely sensitive negotiations over the renewal of the BBC’s Charter in 2016, while dealing with Government demands to reduce the Corporation’s reliance on the licence fee.

Lord Hall’s wife Cynthia earns a six-figure salary at headhunters Saxton Bampfylde, which were also used by Speaker John Bercow as part of his controversial decision – currently stalled – to appoint Australian Carol Mills as the new Clerk of the Commons.

Lord Hall, previously chief executive of the Royal Opera House, became Director-General in April 2013 on £450,000 a year. His wife is the former head of private girls’ school Wycombe Abbey and joined Saxton Bampfylde’s 18-strong team last year. The couple have two grown-up children.

Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the Media Select Committee, said: ‘This is a ridiculous waste of public money. Anyone who really wanted to apply for this job and who was suitable for it would have been aware of the vacancy anyway or would have seen it advertised in the newspaper and applied for it.

‘There only are a limited number of suitable candidates for a post like this. I can’t understand why it’s necessary to hire headhunters – and certainly not a firm which the BBC Director-General’s wife works for.’

A spokesman for the Culture Department said: ‘The Head of the BBC Trust needs to be a high- calibre and experienced person and specialist recruitment agencies help to select the very best candidates for the job.’

The department denies that the appointment of the headhunters risked a conflict of interest, saying Lady Hall was not involved in the recruitment of Mrs Fairhead.
