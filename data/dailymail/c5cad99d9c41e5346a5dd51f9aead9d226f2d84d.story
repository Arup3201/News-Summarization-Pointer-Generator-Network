With perfect grace, two magnificent horses take dressage to a different level.

Almonzor and Ocle, Spanish Andalusians, are being put through their paces in haute ecole — an equestrian discipline not seen in this country for 300 years.

Haute ecole (high school) is equine ballet. A horse undertakes an extraordinary series of choreographed leaps, kicks and canters known as ‘airs above the ground’.

After more than 300 years the art of historic classical horse dressage 'Haute Ecole' is performed at Bolsover Castle, Derbyshire previously owned by Lord Cavendish

The levade move was first taught at the beginning of the 20th century, asking the horse to hold a position approximately 30-35 degrees from the ground

In a spectacle as breathtaking as it 
is beautiful, these magnificent horses perform the complex dance-like 
steps in an equine equivalent of ballet.

The white ‘pillar’ in the centre of the riding school is used to encourage the animals to move in ever-decreasing circles.

The horses in these photographs – Almonzor and Ocle – are Spanish Andalusians, one of the few breeds 
with the physical strength and intelligence to master the discipline.

Advanced dressage training techniques were introduced to England in the 17th century by William Cavendish, first Duke of Newcastle, once riding master to King Charles II

They are pictured performing at 
Bolsover Castle in Derbyshire, once the seat of Cavendish, and now the 
only British venue for ‘haute ecole’.

Rider Ben Atkinson,19, instructs six-year-old Ocle to perform moves such as a 'Capriole', where all four of the horses 
legs are off the ground at once.

The discipline was once said to have 
originated on the battlefields of the seventeenth century when 
cavalrymen needed to carefully manoeuvre their mounts among foot 
soldiers but historians now believe it is more likely that it developed 
from exercises used to strengthen horses for combat.

Three
hundred years ago the British were world leaders at the sport. ‘Haute 
ecole’ was introduced to this country by William Cavendish, first Duke 
of Newcastle and riding master to Charles II.

However, after the art was perfected it died out in Britain, with the Spanish and French now reigning supreme.

Cavendish is still considered the father of modern dressage though, and echoes of British prowess at ‘haute ecole’ can be seen in the Olympic champions of our modern dressage team.

The sport of dressage proved a big hit at the London 2012 Olympics where Team GB won a total of five medals.

Charlotte Dujardin mesmerised the nation with her performances of routines on her horse Valegro, winning gold in the team dressage and individual dressage events.

Her sequence featuring Land of Hope and Glory, The Great Escape and the chimes of Big Ben proved a big hit with the judges and raised the profile of dressage as a sport among the British people.

Last year was the first time Britain had ever won a medal in an Olympics dressage event.
