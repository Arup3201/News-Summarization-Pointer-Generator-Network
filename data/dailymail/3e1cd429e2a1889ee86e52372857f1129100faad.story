A high school student who disappeared after posting a Tweet claiming there was an intruder in her house has been spotted on CCTV at a train station.

Kara Alongi, 16, posted a misspelled message to her Twitter page around 6.20pm Sunday night that gave the impression that she was in a panic, stating: 'There is someone in my hour ecall 911'.

Her Twitter followers did not call the 
authorities, but her parents did once they returned to the family home 
in Clark, New Jersey, and realized that the girl was missing.

But the teenager has now been spotted on CCTV holding a backpack and a large purse while waiting for a train at the NJ Transit station in Rahway.

Suspicious claim: Kara Alongi, 16, posted this message to Twitter around 6.20om on Sunday night while her family was out watching her younger brother's sporting game

The 16-year-old's lone tweet that appeared to be a desperate plea for help went viral with hundreds of Twitter messages posted hoping for a her safe return.

Clark police confirmed Sunday night that the girl's initial tweet was a hoax and there were no signs of foul play in Alongi 's home. The teenager is still missing.

At the time of her disappearance, her family were watching her younger brother's sporting event.

Police brought a canine unit to the home and, according to their press release, the dogs 'tracked Kara's scent from the back door of the house, through a neighbor's yard and then to the sidewalk and around the corner back onto her block where the scent goes cold.'

After initially believing the Tweet, police became suspicious because there were no signs of foul play or abduction.

Disappeared: Police traced a phone call placed from her house to a local cab company around the same time as the Tweet, and the cab driver identified her as the girl he picked up

The biggest sign, however, that something was amiss came from phone records that showed someone in the Alongi's home called a local taxi company and ordered a pick up at their address right around the time that Kara posted the intruder claim to Twitter.

'The investigation quickly revealed a number of inconsistencies in the teen's statement,' the police statement reveals.

The local Patch site reports that police got in touch with the taxi driver who picked up the request, and the man identified Kara as the girl he drove to the nearby Rahway train station.Â 

Gone: The taxi driver took her to the nearby Rahway train station which has regular services to Manhattan

The train station serves the Northeast Corridor line and the North Jersey Coast line, both of which have their northern-most stop in Manhattan.

'Kara might feel that she will be in trouble if she comes home after this scare and causing a panic. At this point all everyone cares about is seeing her safe and at her house where she belongs,' the police statement concluded.

As of noon on Monday, Kara was still listed as missing and police have not reported any further developments from their overnight search.
