Thanks to gym visits and an exercise regime that includes swimming and power walking, I pride myself on being a High Street size ten. But there’s one part of my body that refuses to slim down, that I have always been ashamed of: my thick, shapeless ankles.

Not for me, calves elegantly slimming down to a tapered point just above the heel. Instead, I have a stubborn chunk of shapeless flesh, a fusion of calf and ankle known as the cankle. Some people are cursed with cankles because they are overweight or retain fluid there. In my case, it’s down to bad genes.

I’ve tried everything I can think of to conceal them, from leggings to full-length skirts. But nothing seems practical. So I’ve adopted a uniform of ankle boots — clinging to a wintry look well into summer.

Can I shake-up my wardrobe and camouflage the dreaded cankle? The Mail’s Fashion Editor, Eliza Scarborough, gives me her tips…

ELIZA
 SAYS: The perfect optical illusion. A maxi dress with a high slit means
 you show a tantalising side view of leg. It’s important the hemline 
falls at the ankle — the point where it hits the ankle will break up 
those chunky cankles.

MY 
VERDICT: I usually feel frumpy in long dresses, but I absolutely love 
this one. You get a glimpse of flesh, while the glittery shoes wink 
through the gap. There’s lots to distract from my cankles. Plus, the 
partly covered side view of leg means you only get a cross-section of 
cankle.              SCORE: 5/5

ELIZA
 SAYS: Ankle straps draw the eye to a cankle. Instead, opt for a 
sling-back shoe with an open or strappy toe. And avoid chunky straps. 
The black shoes here have slim straps that make feet and ankles look 
daintier.

MY VERDICT: I 
assumed an ankle strap would give me definition. These are pretty and 
the unusual shape draws the eye away from my cankles. However, I think 
my ankles are just too hefty to pull off this look.      

SCORE: 2/5

Lace-detailed dress, £179, reiss.comSuede knee-high  boots, £265, lucychoilondon.com

ELIZA
 SAYS: Knee-high boots are best if you like dresses but not your ankles.
 Detail at the top — such as a tassel, buckle or side seam — will draw 
the eye away from your cankles. Avoid detail around the ankle, and 
choose a slightly shorter skirt to show a bit of knee.

MY VERDICT: The side seam on the boots creates a slender appearance. I love the combination with the dress. Foxy!

ELIZA
 SAYS: High-waisted skirts lengthens legs and makes ankles appear 
slimmer, as calves seem longer. Hemlines should skim the knee or fall 
just below.

MY VERDICT: The 
last time I wore anything this high-waisted was in the Eighties. But 
this look really works — although I got slight vertigo climbing into the
 Jimmy Choos.                  SCORE: 4/5

Knit dress, £245, lkbennett.com40 denier tights (pack  of three), £9.50,  marksandspencer.comSuede courts, £99, mintvelvet.co.uk

ELIZA
 SAYS: Black tights are a woman’s best friend for giving long, lean legs
 and ankles. But stick with black heels, as a contrasting shoe will draw
 attention to your ankle area. And try suede, to blend in with your 
tights.

MY VERDICT: This look 
is more about disguise than contouring. It reminds me of a dowdy female 
frontbencher. But suede rather than patent is a great tip.

ELIZA
 SAYS: A round-toe shoe creates a blockier look — terrible if you have 
cankles, as it shortens the foot and leg. Pointed toes are more elegant,
 and  lengthen the foot.

MY 
VERDICT: Pointy shoes remind me of bad Halloween parties where 
middle-aged women dress as ‘sexy witches’. But these work! I may never 
wear ankle boots again.
