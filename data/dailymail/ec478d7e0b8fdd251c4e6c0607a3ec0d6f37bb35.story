In an interview with the Today Show on Wednesday, Second Lady of the United State Jill Biden opened up about why she fell for then-Senator Joe Biden more than 30 years ago.

'Was it his humor? What was it?' asked Today's Tamron Hall.

'Oh, no,' replied Jill. 'I loved his two sons - our two sons - Bo and Hunter. So I always say that I fell in love with the boys first.'

Jill Biden takes questions from twitter on Wednesday's Today Show about her personal life. A viewer asked what Biden reads for fun, and Today's Tamron Hall said she hoped Biden wasn't reading Fifty Shades of Grey, which elicited laughter from both women

It's no secret that Second Lady of the
 United States Jill Biden did not fall in love with Vice President Joe 
Biden at first sight. The VP has noted in an interview with Rachel Ray 
last month that he proposed to Jill five times before she said, 'yes.'

'The fifth time, I said to her, "Jill,
 my Irish pride has gotten a hold of me. This is the last time I'm gonna
 ask you," ' I said. ' "You don't have to tell me when you will marry me, 
just if you'll marry me." ' 'She said, "yes." '

'Everybody knows I love Jill more than she loves me,' he said, joking, later in interview.  

On Today, Jill Biden also gave viewers a taste of a day in her life.

'There really is no typical day. You know, I'm a teacher, I teach full time. I wake up before 6 a.m., then I go out to teach some days,' she said.

Biden said there is one activity that she does try to do consistently, though: working out.

'I'm a runner. I try to exercise every day, so I run a couple times a week and I take barre class a couple times a week.'

Biden answered personal questions during her visit to the show Wednesday, but the purpose of her appearance was to promote a new website
 that makes it easier for service members, veterans, their spouses and 
dependents to calculate their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits at thousands of
 schools and job training programs.

'In just a couple easy steps they can figure everything out,' Biden told The Associated Press before the show.

Using the GI Bill comparison tool, 
service members can estimate tuition and fees, housing allowances and 
book stipends for each school. They also can find data on graduation 
rates, loan default rates, median borrowing levels and other indicators.

Before
 the website was created, service members had to consult multiple 
sources to find the same information, said Biden, a military mom. Her 
stepson Beau serves in the Delaware National Guard.

The website launched in February, but the vice president's wife is highlighting its existence as she and first lady Michelle Obama mark the third anniversary this month of Joining Forces, their nationwide support program for service members, veterans and their families.

Biden said on Today that she and Mrs. Obama started the site 'to encourage all Americans to support and honor our military families.'

Last week at the White House, both women recognized the millions of caregivers of sick or wounded service members and veterans.

The website was created under an executive order President Barack Obama signed two years ago to make sure GI Bill beneficiaries have the information they need to compare options and make the best choices about their education benefits.

Congress created the Post-9/11 GI Bill in 2008. Service members and veterans who have spent at least 90 days on active duty since Sept. 10, 2001, are eligible.

The Veterans Affairs Department says it has distributed more than $30 billion in tuition and other education-related payments under the bill to more than 1 million veterans, service members and their families, and to the universities, colleges and trade schools they attend.
