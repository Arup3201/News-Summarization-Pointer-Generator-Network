As Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund prepare for their first clash of the new season, relationships between the two clubs could barely be more strained.

The two German giants face each other on Wednesday night in the DFL Supercup, Germany's equivalent of the Community Shield. Dortmund's 80,000 seater Westfalenstadion is already sold out, and while the trophy may not be the most prestigious, the ongoing conflict between the two clubs is sure to make the game a heated affair.

Dortmund chief executive Hans Joachim Watzke wrote to FC Bayern this weekend, confirming that he and his colleagues will not be sharing a meal with their Munich counterparts on the day of the game. The German Football League had invited both clubs to eat together, but Watzke claims that 'the deep running disharmony' between the two clubs would make such a gesture 'pointless'.

Clash: When Bayern meet Dortmund it is always a huge affair and the Supercup will be no different

The latest war of the words between Dortmund and Bayern emerged last week, after Bayern boss Karl-Heinz Rummenigge betrayed his club's desire to sign Dortmund star Marco Reus, and revealed details of Reus' release clause.

This prompted Dortmund Director of Sport Michael Zorc to tell Rummenigge to 'keep his mouth shut', before his opposite number at Bayern Matthias Sammer responded by saying 'no one can put a gag on us'.

This is not the first conflict between the two clubs who, in recent years, have dominated German football. The touchline scrap between Matthias Sammer and Jürgen Klopp in the spring of 2013 remains fresh in the memory, and with Bayern having signed Mario Götze and Robert Lewandowski from their rivals since then, any civility between the two clubs has disappeared.

Some see the mutual distaste between the two sides as a positive though. Ottmar Hitzfeld, who managed both teams to respective Champions League titles, told the Bild on Sunday that 'the verbals don't harm the Bundesliga. I think they're actually quite good. They liven up the league'.

Rivalry: Guardiola will watch his Bayern team take on Dortmund in a game that promises to be whole-hearted

As for Dortmund's indignation over the Reus affair, Hitzfeld was also quick to defend Bayern. 'There's no reason for Bayern to say 'we won't buy any more Dortmund players'. That would be unrealistic. Bayern want the best team they can get, so they'll sign the best players. Besides, Dortmund signed Reus from Borussia Mönchengladbach in exactly the same way. They used a release clause, just as it seems Bayern will do next summer'.

With every man and his wife sticking their oar in, Wednesday's game promises to be an emotional one. On the field, both teams are on the back foot.

Pep Guardiola will be missing several players through injury, including Rafinha, Thiago and Franck Ribery. The Bayern players who won the World Cup with Germany, meanwhile, have only just returned to training.

'Some will come back quickly, for others it will take longer' said Guardiola, 'I will ask the doctor who is fit, and make my decisions on that basis'.

After Bastian Schweinsteiger was nearly injured during Bayern's pre-season tour of the USA, though, the Catalan will be unwilling to risk too much on Wednesday. The Supercup has often been used to try out younger players - Liverpool's Emre Can played for Bayern in the fixture two years ago. Reports suggest Guardiola may even give a competitive debut to 17 year old Gianluca Gaudino this time around.

Dortmund, meanwhile are looking to recover from a humiliating, if meaningless, 4-0 drubbing to Liverpool at the weekend. Klopp told Ruhrnachrichten that the defeat was merely a case of 'playing the wrong opposition on the wrong day', and said he was confident that 'we will find our rhythm, and then the energy will return too'.

He will have to hope that happens by Wednesday. The Supercup may not be the season highlight, but with Dortmund and Bayern having contested the last three encounters, it is important if only in the context of their ongoing fights. With Hans Joachim Watzke having just extended his contract at BVB until 2019, and Bayern showing no signs of calling a truce, it is a fight which will go on for a long while yet.
