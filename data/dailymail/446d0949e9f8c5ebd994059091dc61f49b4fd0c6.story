Young people are half as likely to want Britain to leave the European Union as pensioners, a new study reveals.

Just 32 per cent of 18-24 year olds would consider voting to sever ties with Brussels in a referendum, compared to 60 per cent of the over-65s.

It raises the prospect of the in-out vote promised by David Cameron being fought along generational lines, with those in favour of remaining in the EU relying on getting young people to the ballot box.

Young voters are much less likely to want to leave the EU than the over-65s, according to the ICM poll for British Future

The Tories have promised to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership, claiming powers back from Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

The new study by the think tank British Future shows young Brits are much more pro-European and fear leaving the EU would hit jobs and the economy.

Among all voters, 26 per cent said they were planning to vote 'firmly out' in a referendum, with a further 24 per cent 'leaning' to vote out. Just 13 per cent were 'firmly in' and 22 per cent 'leaning in'.

But among 18-24-year olds 20 per cent were 'firmly in' and 21 per cent 'leaning in', with 18 per cent 'leaning out' and 14 per cent 'firmly out'.

The trend is reverse among the over-65s, who are traditionally more likely to vote.

Among pensioners 12 per cent are 'firmly in' and 23 per cent 'leaning in', while 32 per cent were 'leaning out' and 28 per cent 'firmly out'.

The over-65s were much more sure of their views, with only nine per cent responding 'don’t know' compared with 26 per cent of the 18-24 age group.

EU age gap

British Future director Sunder Katwala said: ‘Our poll shows that British people are currently leaning more out than in when it comes to a referendum on Europe - but most are a long way from making up their minds and are waiting to see what deal David Cameron can get on the terms of our membership. 

’It will be a challenge for those who want to stay in the EU, with only younger people in favour of staying in - a group that is less likely to vote than those aged over 65.

‘This could make a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU the first major political event where opinion is divided along generational lines, when we’ve previously viewed political questions as decided by class, geography or gender.’

Eight in 10 18-24-year-olds said jobs and the economy would be important when deciding how to vote in a referendum, compared with 62 per cent of over-65s.

Unsurprisingly just half of pensioners were worried about the loss of the right to work in the EU, compared to 77 per cent of 18-24 year-olds.

Younger voters were also most worried about having less influence in the US, less influence on border controls and losing EU funding for disadvantaged regions of the UK.

The ICM Research will be published in a report by British Future tomorrow.
