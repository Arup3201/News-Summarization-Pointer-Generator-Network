Love triangle: Katie Gilmore, pictured, has admitted she played her two lovers off against each other

A cheating woman has declared her love for the man who killed her TV actor boyfriend.

Katie Gilmore, 27, was in a relationship with Gary Suller – who had appeared in Doctor Who and Casualty – but said she had ‘more feelings’ for her second lover, Barry Bowyer.

Heroin addict Bowyer, a jury has heard, was so envious of Mr Suller, 45, that he battered him to death, in a ‘prolonged, unrelenting and brutal attack’.

He has continued to receive letters from Miss Gilmore, while in custody awaiting trial.

At the trial this week she said: ‘I had more feelings for Barry than for Gary. I’ve fallen in love with him.

'I used to go to Gary when I had arguments with Barry but I always went back to him.

'He was the one I wanted to be with.’

A court has heard that Mr Suller, a divorced father-of-two, was ‘besotted’ with Miss Gilmore, even though friends warned him to stay away from her.

She told a jury: ‘Gary kept on sending me flowers, letters and text messages, so I started going on dates with him.

‘I was never in love with him, I loved him as a person but he was more like a father figure to me.

He was kind and a gentleman, I met his daughters, they were lovely and he was a brilliant dad.

Tragic: Father-of-two Gary Suller, left, was killed by Barry Bowyer, right, in
 a bitter love triangle over Katie Gilmore, Cardiff Crown Court was told

‘He told me he was in love with me and 
he wanted to marry me. We even went to the registry office but I had no 
intention of going through with it.’

In love: Miss Gilmore said Barry Bowyer, who has admitted manslaughter, is the love of her life

She added: ‘Barry was jealous about the amount of flowers and letters he sent to me and I can’t say I blame him.’

Bowyer, 38, wanted to kill the actor so he could have Miss Gilmore all to himself, Cardiff Crown Court has been told.

He is said to have broken into Mr 
Suller’s three-bedroom terraced house in Cwmbran, South Wales in 
September last year and punched and kicked him to death.

The court heard from other witnesses that Mr Suller had been petrified of Bowyer.

Prosecutor Peter Davies told the 
trial: ‘Barry Bowyer and Gary Suller were not strangers to each other.

They were both in love with the same woman.

‘Bowyer laid in wait for Gary to come
 home before commencing a savage and bloody attack.

It was a prolonged, 
unrelenting and brutal attack where he inflicted gross and fatal 
injuries.’

‘Friends say it appeared Katie was flitting between Gary and Barry.

'But Bowyer started to become more possessive. He started to say he hated Gary.

'He told Katie that if she didn’t get rid of Gary then he would.’

On the day of his death, Mr Suller 
had discovered he had won a part in The Indian Doctor, a BBC comedy 
drama starring Sanjeev Bhaskar.

Bowyer, of Cwmbran, denies murder, claiming he killed Mr Suller in a ‘momentary lapse’.

He admits burglary and manslaughter. The trial continues.

Talented: Gary Suller is pictured during his many acting roles. He appeared in Doctor Who, Casualty and other television dramas, often as a policeman or prison officer
