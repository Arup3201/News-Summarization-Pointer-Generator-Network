Ever feel like you've forgotten something? These people might.

The amazing sculptures pictured here look like they're missing vital organs. They are work of French artist Bruno Catalano who says the invisible bodies represent a world citizen.

Mr Catalano, 53, is originally from Morocco but a lifetime of travel as a sailor has inspired these quirky pieces of art, which often cause passers-by to do a double-take

Mr Catalano has been sculpting for 20 years and often works with others in an art foundry when making big sculptures

Now living in Marseille, France, Mr Catalano and his daughter Emilie work to create masterpieces like these.

Made out of bronze, Mr Catalano starts the process by carving the characters from clay - and will then spend a further 15 days working on them.

Mr Catalano said: 'I have travelled a lot and I left Morocco when I was 12 years old. I felt that a part of me was gone and will never come back.

'From years of being a sailor, I was always leaving different countries and places each time and it's a process that we all go through.

No its not a  mind trick - these are the amazing sculptures that represent a world citizen according to their creator

'I feel like this occurs several times during life and of course everyone has missing pieces in his or her life that he wont find again.

'So the meaning can be different for everyone, but to me the sculptures represent a world citizen.

'I get inspiration mainly from people around me - familly, friends, neighbours, even colleagues or strangers. My other source of inspiration is the travel.'

Mr Catalano has been sculpting for 20 years and often works with others in an art foundry when making big sculptures.

An exhibition will take place in Marseille in September, to celebrate its status as the European Capital of Culture 2013 with ten life-size sculptures exhibited at the port of Marseille.
