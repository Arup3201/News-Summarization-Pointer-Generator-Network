Sam Allardyce believes West Ham's new-found confidence can propel them to a shock victory over Manchester City on Saturday.

The Hammers climbed into the Premier League top four after their 3-1 win over Burnley at Turf Moor last weekend, recording their first back-to-back league successes since March.

And Allardyce has backed his side to repeat their earlier triumph over Liverpool when the champions come calling at Upton Park.

West Ham produced a fine display earlier in the season to beat Liverpool at Upton Park

'I think when you have had back-to-back wins you go into a game that you're not expected to win with much more confidence than you would normally,' he told the club's official website.

'West Ham fans would expect us to get something from the game but across the board not many other people will.

'So we will be looking to cause another storm and another shock like we did against Liverpool a couple of weeks ago.'

Allardyce also reserved praise for his potent strikeforce after Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia scored against Burnley.

Sakho has six goals from as many games for his new club while Valencia followed up his hat-trick for Ecuador last week with his second for the Hammers.

'He's [Sakho] hit the ground well and surprised us all and we just want to make sure it continues,' Allardyce added. 'It's my job to make sure he keeps his feet on the ground and doesn't get carried away.

'When Enner came back having scored three goals [for Ecuador], he was never not going to play as we hoped he would carry that on and he has.

'These two lads will get more and more attention. At the moment they're a bit of nobodies in the Premier League but soon people will catch on and will make life a bit more difficult for them. We'll see if they can handle that but they're certainly the big two for us at the moment in terms of these victories.'
