The parents of an Australian Muslim convert who was killed in a US drone strike in Yemen are still waiting for answers from the government more than six months after their son's death.

Christopher Havard, 27, was killed when a missile hit the car he was traveling in with another Australian-New Zealand national and three members of terror group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) on November 19 last year.

Mr Havard grew up in Townsville and was jailed at 16 for stealing a car. But in 2008 he converted to Islam at a Queensland mosque before moving to New Zealand and eventually Yemen, apparently to teach English.

Australian Federal Police were investigating Mr Havard's alleged links to Al Qaeda and his involvement in the kidnapping of three Westerners in Yemen in 2012 before his death.

But Mr Havard's mother and step-father Bronwyn and Neill Dowrick, from Townsville in Queensland, told the 7.30 Report their son was dead for a month before they were told and since then they have been kept in the dark about the details surrounding his death.

Adding to their distress was the fact that the Australian government 'changed the stories every week', with the couple first told he was killed in a Yemeni air strike on a mosque.

The couple wants to know what proof the government has that their son was a member of Al Qaeda.

'Everything the government is saying, it's all hearsay, there's never been one ounce of proof given to us by any department of the government to prove that he was or he was not a terrorist, because they don't want to,' Mr Dowrick said.

Ms Dowrick wants to know exactly how her son died.

'We've got no closure. We've got no proof of Chris's body or death certificate or how he was actually killed, so how can you move on?' she said.

According to heavily censored documents obtained by the ABC, Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop was given information saying Mr Havard was 'involved' with Al Qaeda just four days before the US drone attack.

The documents, obtained under Freedom of Information laws, show Australian police had been investigating Mr Havard's possible involvement in the kidnapping of a Finnish couple and an Austrian man in Yemen in 2012.

The three Westerners were released in May last year after a multi-million-dollar ransom was paid.

The documents show confusion over whether Daryl Jones, a joint Australian-New Zealand Muslim convert who was killed in the same drone strike as Mr Havard, was also linked to AQAP with one document saying Mr Jones was only 'probably' associated with the group.

Another document says the pair were members of Al Qaeda.

Mr Havard moved to Yemen in 2011, three years after converting to Islam following a troubled past.

The Australian government first told the Dowricks their son was killed in a Yemeni air strike on mosque, before telling him it was a US strike on a car. Pictured is a file photo of a US unmanned Predator drone

After spending time in jail for stealing a car aged 16 he wanted to turn his life around.

Mr Havard befriended a group of Muslim students while studying at James Cook University.

He converted to Islam at the King Fahd mosque in Townsville in 2008 before moving to Christchurch in New Zealand and joining the local mosque.

Mr Havard told his parents he encountered radical Islam at the Christchurch mosque but said he 'didn't agree with what they were teaching' so he moved to Dunedin.

Then in 2010 he surprised his parents with news that he was moving to Yemen to teach English. Mr Havard said his trip was fully paid for but he never told them who paid for it.

The Dowricks stayed in contact with their son while he was in Yemen, but in 2012 they learned he was under suspicion from the government when they received a phone call from Australia's spy agency ASIO saying Mr Havard's passport had been cancelled.

Since Mr Havard's death the Dowricks say they have received death threats and have been harassed on the street in Townsville.

Mr Dowrick said now all he wants from the government is: 'The straight-out truth. No lies. The straight-out truth.'
