A college student who was left with a paralyzed face after being diagnosed with Bell’s Palsy found an inspiring way to deal with the condition, using it for a Halloween costume mimicking 'not-impressed' gymnast McKayla Maroney.

Leslie Barrett had been struggling to cope with the condition, which causes temporary paralysis in one side of the face, after being struck down in August while a student at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas.

After she posted a picture of herself on Facebook, someone pointed out that the Bell's Palsy had left her looking like Maroney after she took a tumble and only won the silver medal in the vault finals at the 2012 Olympics.

It quickly became a popular internet meme with even President Obama getting involved and pulling his own 'not-impressed' look in the Oval Office.

The condition was named after Charles Bell (1774-1842), a Scottish anatomist and surgeon known for a number of neurological finds, including the discovery that the inflammation of the facial nerve that travels through the skull in a narrow bony canal can cause temporary paralysis of the facial muscles on one side.

Bell’s Palsy is a rare condition, affecting one person in 5,000, and has no known specific causes, though it’s thought that viruses might play a part.

When a nerve is not functioning or missing muscles in the face do not receive essential signals to work properly. This results in paralysis of areas of the face

Each side of the face has its own facial nerve, so damaging the left facial nerve will only affect the left side of the face, and vice versa.

The condition can also be triggered by surgery, Lyme disease, neurological conditions, traumatic injuries to the brain, skull or face, birth trauma and congenital conditions.

After dressing up as Maroney for Halloween, Miss Barrett posted a picture to the gymnast's Facebook page.

She wrote: 'Two months ago I was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, which means the right side of my face is temporarily paralyzed and I can only express emotion on my left.

'Last week at a party someone pointed out that I normally look like your "not impressed" face. I decided to incorporate my disability into my Halloween costume and dress up as you.

'This has hands down been the best costume I've ever had. It was the first time in months I got to look like I was intentionally making a face and it has helped me deal with the slow recovery a little better.'

Miss Barrett also went on a first date at what she described as 'the apex' of the palsy, which caused her to constantly blink out of one eye while attempting to make small talk.

Bells Palsy is a condition with affects around one in 5,000 people with most making a full recovery.  Although the exact cause is unknown, it's thought to be because the facial nerve becomes inflamed, possibly due to a viral infection.

George Clooney had Bell's Palsy when he was at Middle school and got called ‘Frankenstein’ as s a result. Fellow actor Pierce Brosnan also suffered from the condition - both made a full recocvery
