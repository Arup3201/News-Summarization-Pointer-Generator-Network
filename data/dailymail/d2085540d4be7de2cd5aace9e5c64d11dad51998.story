Admiral Lord West said he was sure there was the 'odd case' where agents knew about torture

British spies may have been aware of torture carried out by the CIA, a former security minister admitted last night.

In the most frank official acceptance yet of potential complicity, Lord West of Spithead accepted there may have been the ‘odd case’ where UK agents knew of mistreatment and may even have been in the building when it happened.

His comments heaped pressure on David Cameron to order a full judicial inquiry into Britain’s awareness of the barbaric interrogation techniques practised by American agents and exposed by this week’s incendiary US Senate report.

Lord West, who was security minister between 2007 and 2010, told the BBC: ‘Looking back historically, if you are an agent embedded in some foreign country and this was going on, it was quite difficult for them to extricate themselves even though they weren’t implementing that torture.

‘So I’m sure there may be the odd case where an agent was aware what the Americans were doing, but that has now been sealed off because they are very clear now what the position is.’

Campaigners said his comments proved the need for a full judicial inquiry to get to the truth about Britain’s involvement in torture.

They said the promised probe by MPs on the Commons intelligence and security committee would not be able to get to the facts.

John McTernan, a former senior adviser to Tony Blair, said: ‘If the US can come clean, why can’t we? If this is not done, then a suspicion hangs over our security services. We have a right to know.

‘But the traditional UK parliamentary scrutiny is inadequate – the intelligence and security committee is not up to it. Having failed to rise to the occasion after the Snowden leaks and the question of GCHQ’s role in monitoring citizens, the ISC surely has no credibility in looking into this.

‘Britain does have a process for investigating issues like this – it’s a Royal Commission.’

Tom Davies of Amnesty said: ‘We need to know precisely what was done in our name. The British public is tired of being fobbed off with lies, half-truths and inadequate investigations.

‘Nothing short of an independent, judge-led inquiry will draw a line under this shameful chapter.

‘The UK is acting like it’s afraid to turn over the rock for fear of what it will find underneath.’ 

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  report said 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times

There is already chaos in Whitehall over the extent of ministerial contact with the Senate committee and growing fears that the Government lobbied to keep Britain out of the report.

It contained no mention of any of the UK security and intelligence agencies when it was published, despite Britain’s close cooperation with the US in counter-terrorism.

But it has emerged that British officials met the committee before publication. This led to claims that passages relating to Britain’s role in torture could have been redacted from the report for political reasons.

Yesterday the Mail published details of how Home Secretary Theresa May was among the politicians and diplomats who held meetings with the Senate intelligence committee. But last night the Foreign Office issued an extraordinary correction to the information it had released earlier, stating that Mrs May had not met them.

It said: ‘Due to a clerical error, which we very much regret, the FCO’s FOI response of 1 August on contacts with the US Senate select committee on intelligence referred to a meeting between the committee and the Home Secretary in July 2011.

'That was a mistake: her planned visit in July 2011 did not take place and was postponed until September 2011. On that reinstated visit in September 2011, she did not meet the committee.’

Officials admitted they could not confirm last night whether she may have met leading members on subsequent visits in later years.

Mrs May will face close questioning about any discussions she had with senators on Monday when she is due to appear before MPs on the Commons home affairs committee.

And yesterday it emerged that Dianne Feinstein, who led the Senate investigation, could also come to the UK to answer questions on Britain’s role.

The judicial inquiry promised by Mr Cameron into Britain’s involvement in torture and headed by Sir Peter Gibson was ditched in favour of the ISC investigation. Downing Street says a full judicial inquiry could happen if the committee failed to answer all the questions. 

Former CIA Robert Woolsey said he would use the method of waterboarding again, if it meant saving ‘thousands of American lives’.

During an interview with BBC Radio 4 Today, he added: ‘Would I waterboard again Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of the 9/11 killings and beheader of over 40 people?

‘Would I waterboard him if I could have a good chance of saving thousands of Americans or, for that matter, other allied individuals? Yes.’

Al Qaeda's top British terrorist was captured after CIA spies tortured former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg, it was claimed today.

Crucial information provided by Mr Begg while he was being held helped identify 'dirty bomber' Dhiren Barot who was plotting terror attacks on London, according to the long-awaited publication of a report into CIA torture programmes in the wake of 9/11.

The report claims that drawings by Mr Begg – who claims to have been beaten and deprived of sleep in Guantanamo Bay – helped lead British security services to Barot, who had gone to ground in London.

Barot – also known as 'Issa al-Britani' or 'al-Hindi' – was tracked down in 2004 before being found guilty two years later of planning to detonate a dirty bomb and launch an attack on the Tube.

The revelation will prove highly controversial as it appears to contradict the findings of the Senate's intelligence committee report which found that the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation techniques' did not yield information crucial in stopping terror attacks.

It even stated specifically that torture techniques – including waterboarding, rectal feeding and sleep deprivation – at Guantanamo were not central to Barot's arrest, or any other significant breakthrough.

The report criticises the CIA for making 'inaccurate' representations that 'enhanced interrogation' was effective and necessary in producing 'otherwise unavailable intelligence'.

The Government asked for information to be kept out of the US Senate report detailing the scale of torture in CIA prisons, it emerged last night.

After initially insisting that no representations were made to keep secret evidence about British complicity in CIA interrogation programmes, Downing Street yesterday changed its story.

Asked on Wednesday about requested redactions, David Cameron’s official spokesman said there had been ‘none whatsoever, to my knowledge’.

But yesterday his deputy said: ‘My understanding is that no redactions were sought to remove any suggestion that there was UK involvement in any alleged torture or rendition.

'But I think there was a conversation with the agencies and their US counterparts on the executive summary.

‘Any redactions sought there would have been on national security grounds in the way we might have done with any other report.’

It said Barot's arrest 'resulted from the investigative activities of UK government authorities.'

But the report also described how Mr Begg not only suggested where Barot – an old acquaintance – might be found in London, but provided a sketch good enough to identify him, according to report footnotes revealed in the Independent today.

One reference in the report states: 'While still in Pakistani custody, Begg provided reporting on UK-based extremists in the context of terrorist training camps, including information on an individual who would play a key role in 'Issa's' identification and capture.'

In October 2003, CIA officers wrote: 'Our latest information, based on [foreign partner reporting] and a detainee's assessment [Moazzam Begg in US military custody], is that Issa is believed to currently be located in Wembley, a suburb of London.'

According to the CIA document, Begg's 'description and resulting sketch of UK contact Issa al-Hindi' – whose true identity was then unknown – 'was compared to a still shot of an unidentified man taken from a surveillance video of UK extremists.'

The comparison 'revealed that the man in the video probably [was] the elusive Issa al-Hindi.' Just months later, in August 2004, Barot was arrested.

Mr Begg has also reacted furiously to the claim. In a letter to The Independent last night, lawyers for Mr Begg rejected any suggestion that he 'volunteered or co-operated in the provision of information to any intelligence service'.

They added: 'Insofar as he was tortured and under extreme and unlawful continuing duress for three-and-a-half years in Bagram and Guantanamo he, as every other individual subject to such treatment, cannot be regarded in any proper sense of the words to have 'given or provided information' voluntarily.'

Mr Begg was arrested in Pakistan in 2002, and was held at Bagram, Afghanistan, before being sent to Guantanamo Bay.

He was among former detainees who received an out-of-court payment over claims British officials were complicit in his torture.

Mr Begg was arrested again this year – accused of attending a terrorism training camp in Syria. But the charges were dropped in October after it emerged MI5 knew of his activities.
