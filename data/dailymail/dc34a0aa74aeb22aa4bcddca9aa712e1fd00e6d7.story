She's the world's second richest model, runs her own company and cares for a toddler but you'll never catch Miranda Kerr with so much as a hair out of place when she leaves the house in the morning (and returns after a long day at work).

What's her secret? 'Be productive,' says the glossy supermodel as she shares her regimented daily regime.

Writing on her Kora Organics blog, she said: 'Introducing a few activities into your working week will assist with managing stress and may also help you be more productive.'

Secrets to a better life: Miranda Kerr, who is something of a lifestyle guru, has shared her top tips for having a more productive day

The 31-year-old then goes on to share her top tips for being as productive as her. 

The first piece of advice? Start the day nutritiously, which she says helps keeps your energy levels up and assists concentration.

Miranda loves to whiz up her beloved green juice. 'Green cold pressed juices are packed with live, whole ingredients so it’s an instant health hit to the bloodstream,' she said.

'The chlorophyll contained in cold pressed green juices can help keep your blood healthy and are very oxygenating. Green juices are high in vitamins and minerals making them great contributors to clear skin and bright eyes.'

Beauty secrets: As well as stating the obvious ('get a good night's sleep'), Miranda describes dry body brushing your partner as a 'fantastic health practice to exfoliate dry skin and boost circulation 

She also recommends going on a brisk 20-minute walk or even walking to work if you can because, she says, it's better for you and the environment.

If life is getting too much for you, Miranda's simple piece of advice is 'take a break'. 'Download a meditation practice on your iPhone or smartphone, there’s so many wonderful apps that are free and cater for short work breaks and stress relief,' she says.

As well as stating the obvious ('get a good night's sleep'), Miranda describes dry body brushing your partner as a 'fantastic health practice to exfoliate dry skin, increase circulation and improve the drainage of toxins via the lymphatic system'.

Holistic Miranda also explains she likes to carry a small Rose Quartz crystal with her in her handbag. 

She explains: 'Rose Quartz is a pink coloured crystal believed to have heart-healing properties. It encourages healthy self-love, and can bestow compassion, forgiveness and acceptance. Rose Quartz is also soothing, calming and reduces stress and tension.'

Such a fan of the crystal is Miranda that she's added the unique vibrations of Rose Quartz to all of her KORA Organics skincare products.

The filtered water in the products is infused with the energy of the Rose Quartz crystal, so that vibration of love and intent flows through the crystals, into the products and onto you, she explains.
