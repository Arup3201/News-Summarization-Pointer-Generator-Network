Top English students reach university believing Charles Dickens is ‘just as old’ as William Shakespeare, an academic has warned.

Even those with three As at A-level including English can’t put books in historical context, according to Professor Helen Fulton, head of English and related literature at the University of York.

They fear being stretched, stick to easy works studied in sixth form and choose short or computer-based texts over those with plot, character and clear narrative structure, she said.

Top English students do not know that William Shakespeare, left, and Charles Dickens, right, were born 250 years apart, according to Professor Helen Fulton of York University

Professor Fulton spoke out at a 
Westminster Education Forum seminar, where critics described the 
Coalition’s new English curriculum as ‘impoverished’ and based on ‘dead 
white males’.

The Government has scrapped a list of 
suggested authors at Key Stages Three (ages 11 to 14) and Four (14 to 
16). At Key Stage Four, pupils must study two Shakespeare plays; 
Romantic poetry; a 19th-century novel; First World War poetry; British 
fiction, poetry or drama since 1918 and world literature written in 
English.

The Government says they should ‘read 
for understanding’, for example ‘distinguishing between main and 
subsidiary themes and summarising texts’.

Professor Fulton said the change ‘seems to emphasise skills rather than knowledge’.

She said: ‘I would have thought it should be the other way round at Key Stage Four.

Professor Fulton criticised the curriculum saying it emphasises 'skills rather than knowledge'

‘By then, you would expect the skills to be there and you want to start broadening knowledge.

‘Many come [here] thinking Dickens is 
as old as Shakespeare because they’re all in the past. Getting a sense 
of chronology is something we have to work at.’

Professor Fulton said her department was ‘very high performing’, with eight applicants for every place.

The medieval literature expert added 
she relies on ‘good A-level preparation’, and while ‘by and large, we’re
 not disappointed’, some students are slow to try unusual texts from 
different periods offered at university.

She said: ‘We have some worries about 
the tendency towards a retreat from difficulty, for example students 
feeling slightly reluctant to be stretched...because they’re afraid they
 won’t be able to write on something they’re not familiar with.’

Some students believe it takes too 
long to learn and is ‘much  easier to dash something off on  a 
Shakespeare play they’ve  already studied for A-level’, she said. She 
added: ‘We’re also  very aware of the impending death of narrative.

‘Students are consuming texts that are
 not narratives in the classic realist sense of having a beginning, a 
middle and end and a bit of plot development and character development.

‘They’re consuming short texts, video games, computer-based texts.

‘Again, that’s something we’re trying to manage. I’m sure it’s the same in A-level classes.’

Professor Fulton said students should know modern works, such as the Booker prize winners.

Dr Simon Gibbons, chairman of the 
National Association for the Teaching of English, told the seminar the 
new secondary curriculum is too limited and old-fashioned.

He called the Government’s plan a 
‘pretty impoverished version of what English is’, with a narrow range 
drawn from a canon of ‘dead white males’.
