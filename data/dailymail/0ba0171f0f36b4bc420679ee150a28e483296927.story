California State Treasurer Bill Lockyer has had a change of heart about divorcing his wife, who recently completed a rehabilitation stint after getting caught up in a career-ending drug and sex scandal.

Lockyer, 71, one of California's most powerful Democrats, and his wife of 10 years, Nadia, 'have agreed to try and reconcile' and 'work things out,' according to the treasurer’s spokesman Tom Dresslar.

The treasurer filed for divorce last July citing irreconcilable differences with Nadia Lockyer, the 41-year-old former Alameda County supervisor who resigned in disgrace last April over her extramarital affair and drug abuse.

Legal woes: Mrs Lockyer, once a rising star in Northern California government, was forced to resign from the Board of Supervisors last year after she was arrested on drug charges and admitted to having an affair

Mrs Lockyer crashed her car into a pole and a tree the day her husband broke the news about his decision to divorce her and file for joint custody of their son, San Francisco Chronicle reported. 

Two months later, the married mother 
of one was arrested and charged with drug violations and child 
endangerment after being found in possession of meth at a relative's 
home in Orange County, where she had been staying with the couple's 
nine-year-old son.

Lockyer has since completed a 180-day 
residential drug treatment program, prompting a judge last week to allow
her to see her son, Diego, under the supervision of her husband, the 
boy's aunt or another adult.

The Lockyers’ child had been living with his father in Hayward while his mother was in treatment for her addiction problems. 

'He’s proud of the progress she had 
made in her treatment, and they are both looking forward and not 
backward,' Dressler told San Jose Mercury of Mr Lockyer's outlook on his wife's 
condition.

Mrs Lockyer's attorney, Allan Stokke, 
last week said she is 'doing just fine' and that the judge has been 
pleased with her progress.

Nadia Lockyer issued a statement Thursday through her attorney, which said in part: 'I thank my husband and family for their unwavering support. 

'Bill and I agree reconciliation would be best for Diego and for us, and we're committed to reaching that goal.'

Nadia Lockyer's troubles began in February 2012 when she reported being sexually assaulted by a former boyfriend at a hotel in Newark, New Jersey.

The 41-year-old, once a rising star in Northern California government, later admitted to having a long-term affair with Stephen Chikhani, whom she met while in a drug treatment program years earlier.

Mr Lockyer, the state's former attorney general and current treasurer, helped his much younger wife with $1.6million in campaign funding when she won her supervisor seat in 2010.

She resigned from the seat in April following a series of bizarre public incidents that she blamed on drug and alcohol dependency.

According to the San Jose Mercury News, she said at the time she wanted to focus on her family and resolve personal issues.

Mrs Lockyer said at the time: 'We're married. There's no talk of changing that. We're committed to our son.'

The sordid details of the political 
power couple began to leak out last February when Mrs Lockyer called 
police to a hotel where she was staying to report that she had been 
assaulted by her former lover, a convicted felon whom she met in rehab 
for addiction.

A police investigation revealed an 
ongoing relationship between Mrs Lockyer and construction worker Steve 
Chikhani, including explicit text messages and pictures sent between the
two but he was never charged.

Mr Lockyer was also reportedly sent a sex tape of his wife and lover and Mrs Lockyer revealed that they had been together for a year before she ended the relationship.

Mr Lockyer filed for divorce in July,
citing 'irreconcilable differences' in the legal papers and just hours 
after being served, Mrs Lockyer ran her car off the road and hit a tree.

Police received a tip last week that 
led them to a house where Mrs Lockyer was staying with relatives, 
district attorney's spokeswoman Farrah Emami said.

The woman was not home, but officers 
found methamphetamine and paraphernalia used for smoking it. Later, when
they found Mrs Lockyer, she showed 'objective signs' of meth 
intoxication and she was arrested.

Mrs Lockyer pleaded not guilty in 
court on August 30, 2012, to a felony count of drug possession, two misdemeanor
drug charges and one misdemeanor count of child abuse, because she is 
alleged to have kept the drugs in the home with her son.

She was released after acknowledging she needed to check in to a drug rehab center and is due back in court on Monday.

'Nadia recognizes her error and is in
the process of doing everything possible to regain her health,' said 
her attorney, Allan Stokke.

Mrs Lockyer had made various accusations in the past of abandonment by her husband and that the divorce had been coming for some time.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle she said at the time of their divorce: 'My husband and I have differed on how to protect the family,' she said.

'I feel he has abandoned me and my child, and it's created an unsafe circumstance.'

Even before her resignation from office, Mrs Lockyer publicly accused her husband of mistreatment.

An email that appeared to be sent from Mrs Lockyer went to a newspaper, accusing her husband of supplying her with drugs, a claim he denies.

'I simply can't bear this any longer. Goodbye to everyone,' the note read, prompting the paper to call police, fearing for her safety.

At the time, Mrs Lockyer said, 'Alcoholism and addiction are diseases from which many of us suffer, and unfortunately, I have not been spared.'

She later denied having sent the email and said Mr Chikhani hacked her account. However, a technology expert found the email was sent from Mrs Lockyer's phone and Mr Chikhani's lawyer said his client was at a highly controlled drug rehab facility with only supervised computer access at the time.

A spokesman for Mr Lockyer denied the accusation, saying it was 'BS.'

When the the couple wed in 2003, Mrs Lockyer she was four years younger than Mr Lockyer's daughter from a previous marriage. However, they immediately became a political power couple.

She was the daughter of a well-known Los Angeles-area lawyer and she had made a name for herself working on political campaigns in Orange County.
