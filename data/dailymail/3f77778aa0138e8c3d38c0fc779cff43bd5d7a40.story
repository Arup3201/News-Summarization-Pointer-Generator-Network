A student died hours after being sent home from hospital for the fifth time by doctors who said he was 'stressed'.

Talented IT student Andrew Moore, 20, was admitted to three different hospitals on five separate occasions in the weeks before his death after collapsing and feeling unwell.

His father Peter, from Stockport, said his son was sent home with anti-anxiety drugs and referred to mental health specialists.

Less than 24 hours after his final hospital visit, to Stepping Hill in Stockport, Andrew collapsed at his family home in Cheadle and never regained consciousness.

He was taken back to Stepping Hill and pronounced dead two hours later.

A post-mortem examination was inconclusive and further tests are under way to establish the cause of his death.

His family said Andrew had undergone an operation last year to repair an abnormal connection in a vein between his lungs and heart.

There is no suggestion there were any drugs or medication in his system other than a mild asthma medicine.

Two hospitals where Andrew was treated - Stepping Hill and Wythenshawe - have now launched investigations into the care he received.

Father Peter, 55, of Cheadle, said: 'My son's died and the doctors had ample opportunity to find out what was really wrong with him. Instead they kept telling him he was stressed out and to go home and rest.

'My family are in a lot of pain but we’ve had barely any contact with the hospitals since Andrew’s death and have never got the impression they really want to get to the bottom of it.

'Unfortunately for us the investigation is too little too late, but what really hurts is feeling that my son was so badly let down by the NHS and no-one seems to care.'

In September, Andrew was taken to Leighton Hospital, in Crewe, after collapsing while working for a software company in Alsager, Cheshire. Tests failed to find what was wrong with him.

Stepping Hill Hospital expressed its 'deepest sympathies' to Andrew's devastated family

The next day, the Manchester Metropolitan University student collapsed again and was admitted to Wythenshawe Hospital, where he was prescribed anti-anxiety drug Diazepam.

Andrew was taken by ambulance to Wythenshawe on two more occasions after feeling unwell in the following days. His parents claim, on the second occasion, he was so helpless they could not pick him up off the floor.

He was then referred by the hospital to Stockport Mental Health Crisis, who advised his family to take him to A&E at Stepping Hill Hospital when he had another episode on the evening of October 11.

Doctors took a blood sample from Andrew but after a short chat with a resident psychologist he was discharged, again with a prescription of Diazepam.

He collapsed and died just hours later on the afternoon of October 12.

A spokesman for Stepping Hill said the hospital wanted to express its 'deepest sympathies' to Andrew’s family.

He added: 'Following Andrew’s death we launched an immediate investigation into this incident so that we can fully understand exactly what happened and why.

'While the investigation is ongoing we are unable to comment further, but we are in contact with Andrew’s family and will keep them fully informed of the findings of our investigation.'

Brendan Ryan, medical director of Wythenshawe Hospital, added: 'We are sorry to learn of the death of Mr Moore and our condolences go to his family and loved ones.

'I can confirm that Mr Moore presented at our A&E this year and we are reviewing our involvement with him.

'While Stepping Hill Hospital is carrying out an investigation of its own into Mr Moore’s death we are unable to comment any further at this time.'

A Leighton Hospital spokesman said the hospital was unaware of Andrew's death and declined to comment further.
