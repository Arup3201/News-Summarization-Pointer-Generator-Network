You might hope that every school would want pupils to work their very hardest – and pass any exams with flying colours.

But one primary head has decided there is more to life than educational achievements, and has written to her final-year pupils to tell them not to worry about their results.

Headmistress Rachel Tomlinson and her head of year six, Amy Birkett, told children that there are ‘many ways of being smart’ in the message, which was included with their Key Stage Two results.

They asked the 11-year-old pupils to remember that the scores ‘will tell you something, but they will not tell you everything’.

The letter, which was sent by Barrowford Primary School in Nelson, Lancashire, has been widely circulated on Twitter. Some users said it should be ‘the first thing the new Education Secretary Nicky Morgan should read’.

'We are very proud of you': The inspirational letter was sent out to all Year Six pupils at Barrowford Primary School in Nelson, Lancashire, along with their Key Stage 2 test results yesterday

But it emerged yesterday that the 
school had copied most of the letter from a message sent to pupils at an
 unidentified US elementary school – which was posted on the internet 
last autumn.

This is believed to be the first time the US letter has been used by a school in the UK.

And the British version of the text includes a tell-tale Americanism – a mention of a trip to a ‘really neat place’.

The letter, which was addressed to 
individual pupils, said they had tried their ‘very best during this 
tricky week’ and the school was ‘very proud’ of them. It said test 
results ‘do not always assess all of what it is that make each of you 
special and unique’.

The note then went on to list all the other talents the children possess, outside of exam results and academic achievements. 

Headteacher: Rachel Tomlinson said it was 'lovely' to see so many positive comments about the letter

Praised: Barrowford Primary School (pictured) was last inspected in 2012 and awarded a 'good' rating

A spokeman for the 324-pupil school, 
which was rated ‘good’ by Ofsted when it was last inspected in 2012, 
wrote on Twitter yesterday: ‘Wow. There are posts all over the world 
about this letter!

‘All we did was remind our Y6 how 
amazing they are!’ But one Twitter user posted: ‘Delicious irony that a 
template letter to kids celebrating uniqueness and individuality has 
been ripped off the internet, complete with Americanisms.’

And Chris McGovern, a former 
headmaster and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, last night 
attacked the school for using the letter as a ‘political platform’ to 
give an opinion about the quality of national curriculum tests.

He said: ‘They’re undermining confidence that the children may have in the education system.

‘The message they’re sending is that 
the examination results are in some way invalidated because there are 
other matters at stake. It’s an indirect attack on the Government. The 
message that the school is sending to the children is that somehow they 
are being betrayed by the system.

‘But they are not being betrayed by the system, it’s actually the teachers who are letting the children down very badly.’

He added: ‘If there’s a fault with the tests, it’s that they’re too easy and they’re undemanding.

‘That’s why the Government is toughening them up. But it’s completely unacceptable to do this.

‘Schools should not be a platform for promoting political ideologies – they should be neutral.

Inspection: The school was last inspected by Ofsted in 2012 and awarded a 'good' rating, but told that some teachers occasionally do not 'provide sufficient challenge for all ability groups during whole-class teaching'
