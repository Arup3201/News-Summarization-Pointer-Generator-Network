England certainly need to discover 
some star quality during the one-day series against Australia — although
 the nearest they have come so far is Sussex all-rounder Chris Jordan 
being in the same class at Combermere High School in Barbados as pop 
royalty Rihanna.

Jordan left the school and Robyn Fenty, as Rihanna was 
then, at the age of 16 when he won a sports scholarship to Dulwich 
College.

The travails of England’s besieged cricket captain Alastair Cook include a commercial deal that has landed him in trouble with the England and Wales Cricket Board and the FA.

After the Ashes success last summer, Cook became an ambassador for upmarket menswear brand Kent & Curwen and is the face of their winter campaign, modelling a range of clothing.

But the deal clashes with England’s clothing partnerships with TM Lewin and adidas and a communication breakdown between the ECB and Cook’s agents Paragon meant it wasn’t established if it conflicts with his central contract obligations.

To add to the fuss, both the ECB and the FA have intellectual property rights issues with the Kent & Curwen branding and pictures including the Three Lions badge. The wrangling has gone on throughout the 5-0 Ashes whitewash and proved an avoidable distraction for the England captain, whose mind looked scrambled by the Sydney Test where he was twice out cheaply.

The ECB are intent on protecting their sponsorship partners’ rights but a spokesman said: ‘We hope we can come to a settlement soon that will be agreeable to all parties.’

Sir Ian Botham, England’s legendary warrior all-rounder, may be mortal after all. He suffered a heart problem during the second Test at Adelaide while working for Sky Sports and later missed a day’s cricket to have defibrillator treatment.

However, the brief health setback hasn’t stopped Botham working and playing hard, as well as promoting red wine from wherever he might be during the innings interval of Australian Channel 10’s Big Bash coverage.

Michael Vaughan, who is seen by a number of cricket pundits as the man to replace beleaguered England team director Andy Flower, also has Australia’s Channel Nine TV network after his services. Vaughan, who made his debut on C9 during the Ashes, impressed enough for the Aussies to want to use him on non-England matches as well.

Kevin Pietersen, who is not going to win any ‘him or me’ confrontation with Andy Flower, continues to infuriate senior members of the ECB with his ‘man apart’ attitude.

This includes refusing to drive a sponsors’ Jaguar to England matches like the other centrally contracted players — preferring his own ‘Chelsea tractor’ — so that he doesn’t have to commit to any Jaguar personal appearances. And this at a time when the Aussie cricketers’ availability to sponsors and media is in marked contrast to England’s insular approach.

Former Football League commercial chief Richard Heaselgrave may have jumped before he was pushed. His role had been under scrutiny since the League lost a bumper title sponsorship with B&Q at the last minute and had to replace it on reduced terms with Sky Bet. Heaselgrave, who applied for the CEO’s post that went to Shaun Harvey, also hasn’t delivered a promised play-off sponsor.

Fans of Championship clubs will have to get used to plenty of midweek games in 2015-16. Sky, faced with a void in their football scheduling when BT screen Champions League and Europa League, will move as many major FL clashes as they can away from the weekend.

Missing from the corporate junketing around the Melbourne and Sydney Tests were the all-party parliamentary cricket team, who were Down Under during the previous two Ashes tours. It is understood they were unable to find enough sponsorship for another trip, with the focus on MPs’ expenses.
