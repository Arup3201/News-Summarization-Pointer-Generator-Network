A California man could face 20 years in prison for running a revenge porn site and orchestrating a scheme for victims to pay to have their images removed after being convicted Monday.

Kevin Bollaert, 28, was found guilty of 27 counts of identity theft and extortion for operating ugotposted.com, where anonymous users posted nude photos, often of women and often without their consent. 

Accompanying most of the photos were victims' names, residences and identifying information such as links to social media accounts, authorities stated.

Convicted: Kevin Bollaert, 28, faces up to 20 years after being found guilty of extortion and identity theft for running a scheme for victims to pay to have their images removed from his revenge porn site

He also ran changemyreputation.com, where victims could pay fees of up to $350 to scrub their images and data from Bollaert's other site.

California state law regarding identity theft prohibits the posting of personal information like names and addresses, 'for any unlawful purpose, including with the intent to annoy or harass. 

Authorities believe the conviction is the first against a revenge porn website operator, coming ahead of the trial of Hunter Moore, called 'the most hated man on the Internet' for running isanyoneup.com.

Bollaert notably was not charged under the state's new law criminalizing revenge porn, which was signed after he reportedly shut down ugotposted.com.

Prosecutors claimed that visitors to Bollaert's site posted more than 10,000 nude photos between 2012 and 2013.

They also explained Bollaert made tens of thousands of dollars after victims visited changemyreputation.com and paid between $300 and $350 to get photos removed.

Ruined: In spite of the thousands of emails he got begging to have photos taken down, Bollaert told investigators his life had been ruined by the site

Investigators found that Bollaert received thousands of distressed emails from victims, one who said she was 'scared for my life' and another who said she'd been 'getting nonstop harassing messages.'

The criminal complaint named more than two dozen people as victims, one of whom claimed she was thrown out of her home after her family found out nude photos had been posted of her.

'It ruined my life and I'm still going through it,' she testified. 'I lost my family. They think that I brought shame on them. My reputation is ruined.'

Bollaert's lawyer, Emily Rose-Weber, had argued that while the website may have been immoral, he did not break the law by allowing others to use the site to post photos. 

'It's gross, it's offensive, but it's not illegal,' she said.

Mashable reported that Bollaert, in an interview with agents from the California Department of Justice's eCrime Unit, explained the site was 'just like ruining my life.'

'Yeah, I realize like this is not a good situation,' Bollaert said according to the complaint. 'I feel bad about the whole thing and like I just don't want to do it anymore.'

'I mean I know a lot of people are getting screwed over like on the site. Like their lives are getting ruined,' he said.
