A McDonald's worker who super-sized herself by eating Big Macs twice a day has lost eight stone after switching to the salad bar.

Teresa Mayhew, 25, from South Wales, loved to tuck in to free portions of burger and chips while at work, routinely eating her employer's high-calorie food for both breakfast and lunch, followed by a takeaway kebab or pizza for dinner.

And in just a couple of years her weight doubled to more than 19 stone, forcing her to get bigger and bigger standard issue beige and brown uniforms, until she was wearing a size 26.

Before: Teresa Mayhew from Pentre, South Wales, was eating McDonald's burgers and chips for breakfast and lunch, and watched her weight soar to 19 stone in just a couple of years

She said: 'I was loving the food we sell at McDonalds - I just kept eating and eating.

'We're allowed to have free food. So I'd eat that when I had a break and then when I got home I'd have more food - pizza, chips, kebabs.

'I didn't really know when I was full so it was easy to keep on going.'

Teresa refused to weigh herself for two years, and when she eventually plucked up courage she watched in horror as the needle on the scale went to 19 stone 2lbs.

She said: 'When I started piling on the 
weight it didn't really bother me. But I realised I was taking a huge 
risk with my health - I felt my future was going down the drain.'

After: Teresa Mayhew says she still has a few pounds to lose before she reaches her dream weight, but is still thrilled with her new size

Teresa also became despondent when she couldn't wear most clothes she found on the high street.

She said: 'I was going into clothes shops looking for nice things but I couldn't actually fit into them. So I was wearing the same thing all the time.

'I'd see other people wearing nice clothes and think, "I want to be like that".'

Teresa, from the village of Pentre in the Rhondda Valleys, South Wales, joined a Weight Watchers slimming club and was told to drop burgers from her diet.

So instead of eating fat-packed double cheese burgers for lunch, Teresa started opting for salads.

Then and now: Teresa decided to lose weight when she realised she was risking her health and her future

And at home she started cooking healthy meals for herself while her family carried on tucking into takeaways and chips.

And now, almost two years on,Teresa has lost a staggering 7st 12lb to reach her Weight Watchers 
target of 11st 4lb.

She now wears a dress size 12 to 14, and although she would still like to lose a few pounds, she is thrilled with her new body.

Teresa said: 'It's amazing, I just can't believe I've done it.

'In work, when I see customers I haven't seen for a while they say, "You've changed so much, how have you done it?".'

Breakfast: McDonald's

Lunch: McDonald's

Dinner: Pizza, chips, kebabs

Breakfast: Porridge or Weetabix

Lunch: Salad or soup

Dinner: Quorn spaghetti bolognese

She was lovin' it: Theresa pictured during her McDonald's binging phase, when she routinely ate burgers and chips twice a day

Teresa celebrated her weight loss by going to Mexico with friends - her first holiday in eight years.

She said: 'I kept thinking people would stare at me and call me names because of my size.

'But I've always wanted to swim with dolphins and i did it in Mexico. It was just amazing.'

Pretty in pink: Teresa celebrated her weight loss by treating herself to a holiday in Mexico with friends - her first vacation in eight years

Happy meals? The McDonald's in which Teresa works, and where her weight ballooned to over 19 stone because of the food she was eating
