Martin Kaymer does not conform to stereotypes. The German does not drink beer, enjoys a laugh with his Scottish caddie and considers playing golf in England as ‘coming home’.

‘It’s a strange thing for me as a German; I don’t really like beer that much,’ he said. ‘I don’t drink a lot of alcohol. I know I should do as a German but I just don’t like it. I guess that’s a good thing.’

After winning the Players’ Championship in May, Kaymer put in a dominant display to win the US Open at Pinehurst last month by eight shots.

He celebrated his Players’ win by having a quiet dinner with Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley and his caddie, Scotsman Craig Connolly, before being spotted the next morning — £1 million richer — sitting on the floor at Dallas Airport playing on his phone while waiting for a delayed flight.

Connolly will again be on the bag at Hoylake for the Open this week — where Kaymer, 29, will start among the favourites — after successfully rekindling their partnership following a one-year break which coincided with a slump in form.

‘These days, a lot of golfers are so into themselves, doing their own thing, it’s not often that people laugh,’ said Kaymer. ‘Craig enables me to laugh. He has a great sense of humour and brings a great spirit to the course. Sometimes it’s nice for someone to loosen you up a bit.

‘There’s a balance to find between getting too frustrated if things aren’t going well and not getting too happy in the good times. But it all comes down to experience and knowing how you react in certain situations.

‘Having Craig on the bag helps me achieve that. He’s a very fine caddie but also he’s a nice guy who keeps things in perspective.

‘It’s so important to have respect for each other and keep a distance as well. You can’t get too close. We are doing business together and we both want to be successful.

‘I’ve never been to Hoylake and I don’t know the course. But for me, playing the Open always feels like I’m coming home. It’s real golf where you have to feel the course and play with all the conditions.

'Playing the Open is about playing the game of golf. It’s a mental battle and a fight. The fans really know golf. The Open week says so much about golf. It would be amazing to win it one day.’

He blushes at comparisons with Nick Faldo but, with a re-modelled swing, Kaymer is in the process of forging a career every bit as impressive as Europe’s most prolific post-war Major winner.

Last month’s US Open triumph confirmed that the former world No 1’s resurgence from a slump was complete.

It marked the end of a miserable spell for Kaymer, who struggled to cope with the weight of expectation after winning the 2010 USA PGA and reaching the summit of the world rankings before making the controversial changes he knew he needed to stay at the top.

Two years after re-modelling his swing to add a draw as well as a fade, just as Faldo did as a young man, Kaymer is now the complete player.

‘I have a lot of respect for Nick Faldo’s achievements,’ said Kaymer. ‘He had the same ambitions as me in the past when he made his changes to his swing.

‘I could have played the way I was playing for 20 years but I would have always asked myself “what might have been?”

‘People have made the technical alterations I made sound worse and more extreme than they were. I just added another shot to my repertoire. That’s it. Now I’m very comfortable with hitting any shape.’

Victory this week would see Kaymer claim his third Major — just three behind Faldo. He said: ‘I believe in my ability and trust in my skills. Then it’s just a matter of doing it and being brave.’
