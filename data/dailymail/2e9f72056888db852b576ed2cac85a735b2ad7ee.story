Defiant: David Cameron said all those involved in the culture of top-down targets should take responsibility for the Mid-Staffordshire hospital scandal

David Cameron yesterday shifted the blame for the Mid Staffordshire scandal on to Labour as he faced down yet more clamour for the NHS chief to resign.

In a marked change of tone, he told the House of Commons all those involved in the culture of top-down targets had to consider their position.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt went even further, accusing former ministers of a ‘deafening silence’ about the ‘catastrophic mistakes’ they had made.

He said Labour ‘will be held accountable for what happened’ – specifically for ignoring patient care in a drive to slash waiting times, rank hospitals’ performance and shake up regulation.

Last month’s Francis Report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal did not blame individual ministers and Mr  Cameron insisted there should be no hunt for scapegoats.

The Prime Minister has also steadfastly backed the embattled NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson who has ignored calls from MPs, medical professionals and patients to stand down.

But yesterday Mr Cameron changed his tune at Prime Minister’s Questions when Labour MP Graham Stringer asked why he did not sack Sir David over the needless deaths of up to 1,200 patients at the trust.

Sir David Nicholson faces growing calls to resign for his role in the Mid Staffs scandal

Mr Cameron said Sir David, who 
previously ran the regional health authority overseeing Mid 
Staffordshire, had ‘very frankly and candidly apologised’ for mistakes 
made, suggesting Labour had not.

He said: ‘Everyone has to think of 
their responsibilities with regard to the dreadful events that happened 
at the Staffordshire hospital, including the fact that part of the 
problem was people following a very top-down, target-led agenda which 
led to patient care being put on the back burner.

‘David Nicholson has made his apology
and wants to get on with his job of running an excellent National 
Health Service, and other people, frankly, should be thinking of their 
positions too.’

A Labour source attacked his 
comments, saying: ‘This seems a pretty shabby and cheap attempt to 
politicise the Francis Report. It made clear that no ministers were to 
blame. It is not the right thing to try to politicise what was a human 
tragedy.’

But pressure is piling on ministers 
over their protection of Sir David. Last night at a meeting of the 1922 
Committee of Tory backbenchers, dozens called for his resignation.

Bill Cash, who represents the 
Staffordshire seat of Stone, said: ‘Is there a single person in this 
room who thinks Nicholson shouldn’t go?’

Only one person indicated that they disagreed with Mr Cash.

Sir David caused fury on Tuesday by pleading ignorance to damning evidence that patients were failed on his watch.

He told MPs he had ‘no idea’ about 
the appalling failures of care, ‘no access’ to mortality rates which 
were published in national newspapers, and no sanction over gagging 
agreements signed off by the Department of Health.

Sir David admitted Labour’s 
re-organisation of the NHS was confusing, but pinned no blame on 
ministers. In return, four former Labour Health Secretaries rallied to 
his defence.

Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham,
who was Health Secretary until 2010, has admitted the target culture 
went too far, but has not taken any responsibility for the scandal.

Nor has Alan Johnson, who was in 
office when three reports were commissioned – but not published – into 
the state of the NHS in 2007, revealing a relentless focus on targets 
rather than patients .

Last night Mr Hunt wrote on the 
website ConservativeHome that ‘warnings were suppressed’ by Labour that 
their ‘command and control structure’ for the NHS was not working.

Sir David was in charge of the regional health body supervising the Mid Staffordshire trust, and later head of the Department of Health, over the four-year period in which up to 1,200 are feared to have died needlessly

He said they had to take the blame 
for ‘catastrophic policy mistakes... all of which are having a direct 
target on the lack of compassionate care in parts of the NHS today’.

Mr Hunt added: ‘Labour can and will be held accountable for what happened at Mid Staffs.

‘Unless we hear a proper account from
Labour, the public will reasonably conclude that similar events could 
easily happen again if Labour regained power – because the party that 
used to claim the NHS was safe in its hands is proving by its silence 
the exact opposite.’

No 10 is understood to want to keep 
Sir David because he understands the major reforms to the Health Service
which will be unveiled next month.

The ‘Nicholson challenge’ involves slashing £20billion from the NHS budget.

Sir David's successor? Mark Britnell is believed to be in the frame if the NHS chief gets sacked

The head of the NHS appeared to be  losing his grip on power last night as it emerged that senior directors are quietly lining up a successor.

Sir David Nicholson has repeatedly defied calls to resign, despite being at the centre of one of the worst hospital scandals in living memory.

But the Daily Mail understands senior health service directors believe his position is untenable and are now in the process of appointing a replacement.

The man in the frame is understood to be Mark Britnell, a former adviser to David Cameron, who is currently head of health at consultancy firm KPMG.

He was interviewed by Professor Malcolm Grant, chairman of the NHS Commissioning Board, two weeks ago with a view to being appointed deputy chief executive.

Should he accept the job, he would almost certainly be promoted to chief executive while Sir David is moved aside.

On Tuesday, Sir David was grilled by MPs over his role in the Mid Staffordshire scandal where hundreds died due to poor care. He claimed he had ‘no idea’ of the horrific neglect at the trust and denied being aware of the alarmingly high death rates.

Although the Prime Minister has officially given Sir David his full backing, up to 40 MPs, including Cabinet ministers, want him to leave. Mr Britnell, 47, was previously the NHS’s ‘director general for commissioning’ for two years before leaving for KPMG in 2009.

The married father of two has spent more than 20 years of his career in the health service including six as chief executive of University Hospitals Birmingham.

When David Cameron became Prime Minister in 2010, he invited Mr Britnell to join a ‘kitchen cabinet’ of senior health experts to advise him on the NHS reforms.

But Mr Cameron publicly disowned him in 2011 – claiming he’d ‘never heard’ of him – after Mr Britnell implied the NHS would become increasingly privatised.

Last year however, Mr Britnell said he had ‘every intention of returning to the NHS’. In an interview with the British Medical Journal he said: ‘I love the NHS. I don’t see what is wrong with going and getting some different sector experience to develop my capabilities as manager and go back to the NHS in the future.’

Former health secretary Andrew Lansley is said to have wanted to bring him in to replace Sir David soon after the Tories came to power in 2010. But Treasury officials reportedly objected, claiming Sir David was the only person who could be trusted to keep a grip on the NHS’s finances.

Mr Britnell declined to comment on whether he was considering the role.
