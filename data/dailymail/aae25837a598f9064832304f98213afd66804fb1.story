A married professor at the US Naval War College in Rhode Island who allegedly took a racy photo of his penis that was then posted online has been placed on leave.

A May text message conversation with the photo and professor John Schindler's name atop it was circulated on Twitter early Monday.

Schindler, who is Professor of National Security Affairs at the college, allegedly captioned the photo of his penis 'Got this?'

'Oh dear... :)' the recipient of the sexual snap allegedly said.

Schindler then allegedly wrote 'Now ya got it...'

The image, along with a screenshot of an email allegedly written by Schindler, were uploaded as part of a series by Twitter user @T3H_ARCH3R, Gawker reports, who claimed the messages were between the professor and another Twitter user.

When a Huffington Post reporter reached out, @T3H_ARCH3R wrote 'im sorry sir. I merely posted. Any questions should only be directed to @Currahee88.'

@Currahee88's Twitter account no longer exists.

In the email allegedly written by Schindler, he looks forward to meeting his recipient, whom he calls a 'vixen,' and claims he is in a non-traditional marriage.

'I am married to a very kind and understanding woman, but it's not a marriage in a 'normal' or conventional sense; I won't say more than that now, though I will add that she's...not poor,' he allegedly wrote.

Later on, the letter reads 'Suffice it to say I find you immensely engaging and enticing - you occupy my thoughts more than I easily admit, you vixen - and I have no doubt that any meeting in the flesh would be hours of deep talk and more that I would probably not be able to contain my excitement over easily, if at all.'

A blogger sent a complaint to the War College's administration - and the college's president, Rear Adm. Walter E. 'Ted' Carter Jr., has ordered an investigation. A college spokeswoman said investigators would look into whether the photo could have been falsified.

Updated: Schindler's goodbye was changed to include much shorter text

Schindler refused to discuss the photo by telephone on Monday, citing legal reasons. He has deleted his Twitter account.

Schindler has been critical of leaker Edward Snowden and others and frequently engages in heated exchanges with critics on Twitter.

On his website, he wrote on Monday that he has been subjected to 'nearly non-stop online harassment and stalking' for the past year and 'things have now taken an ugly, indeed sordid turn.' That post was later replaced with a much shorter statement, telling supporters he is taking a break from social media because of personal issues.

Schindler has taught at the college since 2005. He also is a fellow at Boston University, according to its website. His resume says he was a senior intelligence analyst with the NSA from 1996 to 2004.

The Newport, Rhode Island, college said in a statement it could not comment further to protect the integrity of the investigation. It did not say how long the investigation would take.
