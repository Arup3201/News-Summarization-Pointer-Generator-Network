Price hike: Tesco has raised the price of its own-brand, everyday value two-litre bottle still water from 17p to 24p

Tesco was last night accused of ‘shameless profiteering’ after increasing the price of its bottled water by 40 per cent while Britain is in the grip of its worst heatwave in seven years.

Britain’s largest supermarket chain has put up the cost of a two-litre bottle of its own-brand still water from 17p to 24p.

Tesco denied it was cashing in on the heatwave and insisted the move reflected the cost of production.

NHS nurse Ross Evans, 33, discovered the rise when he went to a store in Culverhouse Cross, Cardiff, on Wednesday to buy water for some of  his patients.

The father-of-two said: ‘I didn’t expect Tesco to be so immoral as to put up the price of water in the middle of heatwave and cash in on people’s misery.

‘Given the warnings about the elderly and vulnerable in this weather I think this is shameless profiteering. It’s sneaky.

‘When I realised the price of the bottles had gone up from 17p to 24p I put them down again and walked out.’

The supermarket said the price of Tesco Everyday Value Still Water increased by 7p earlier this month.

A spokesman said: ‘Our prices reflect the cost of production and we keep both as low as possible. We think four bottles of filtered water for less than a pound is still very good value.’

Rivals Sainsbury’s and Asda both sell their own-brand water for 17p.

Last year it was revealed that Tesco’s own-brand water is merely filtered tap water.

At the time a Water UK spokeswoman said: ‘Selling filtered tap water in supermarkets has a whiff of Del Boy about it. I can see it would be a nice money-making wheeze.’
