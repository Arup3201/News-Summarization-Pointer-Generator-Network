Sales of red lipstick are rising as women treat themselves to inexpensive indulgences.

Lipstick sales have previously been suggested as an indicator of economic trouble as women are thought to turn to cheaper treats in times of austerity. 

At least one beauty firm has sold 31,000 red lipsticks in a month - twice the monthly average of sales. 

And overall UK lipstick sales have increased eight per cent – from £126m million in 2012 to a predicted £137million this year, according to the Mintel Colour Cosmetics UK 2014.

Next year sales of the make-up are expected to be worth £141.3million.

Leonard Lauder, chairman emeritus of cosmetics company Estée Lauder, coined the term ‘lipstick index’ in 2001 to explain a sales boost during austerity.

Giorgio Armani Beauty has sold 31,000 red lipsticks in the UK this month so far – twice the monthly average.

But the beauty firm’s research at 21 of its make-up counters in the country, found many women were still scared of wearing the colour.

The survey of 1,000 women revealed someone thought red lipstick did not suit them, while many would not consider wearing the colour due to a lack of confidence.

But Giorgio Armani Beauty’s national face designer Vanessa D’ Ambrosio said: ‘Red suits all complexions. It’s the ultimate symbol of feminine glamour, power and ability, this is why it has never, and will never fall from fashion.

‘Woman often shy away from drawing too much attention to their features and think they must have confidence to pull off the red lip, when in actual fact red gives you confidence.’
