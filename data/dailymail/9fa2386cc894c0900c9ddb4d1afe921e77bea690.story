France were left to rue celebrating too early as Sweden qualified in dramatic style for the 2015 European Under 21 Championship with a last-gasp win in Halmstad. 

French defender Layvin Kurzawa struck three minutes before the end to put the visitors - who were at the time 3-0 down on the night and 3-2 down on aggregate - in charge on away goals. 

Kurzawa then taunted the Swedish players, including Celtic's on-loan Manchester City striker John Guidetti, with an army salute celebration.

But, Kurzawa and the French side were made to pay moments later when Oscar Lewicki popped up to score his second goal of the night and give Sweden a 4-1 lead, moving them back into the driving seat in the tie.

Lewicki and his Swedish team-mates then repaid the favour to Kurzawa by using the same taunting celebration. 

It all meant France were denied their place in Czech Republic next summer and have now failed to qualify for the tournament for eight years.

Sweden had moved into a 3-0 lead in the second leg with two first-half goals from Isaac Thelin and one from Lewicki in the second half.

The Sweden team were then pictured in the dressing room all performing the same celebration after sealing their place in the Euro U21 Championship next year.

And Guidetti posted a picture on Instagram of him again performing the salute with two team-mates.
