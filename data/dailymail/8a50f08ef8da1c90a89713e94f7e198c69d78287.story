The U.S. is looking to release several prisoners from Guantaamo Bay as it seeks to build a relationship with the Taliban on the back of last night's announcement on withdrawing troops from Afghanistan.

'Operational steps' have been put in motion by the Obama administration to move up to five prisoners in the hope it will further peace talks with the Afghan Taliban, according to a senior congressional official.

The revelations follows U.S. Defence Secretary, Leon Panetta's announcement that he wants troops in Afghanistan to end their combat 
role by as early as the middle of 2013.

Controversial release: The Obama administration have acknowledged that to build trust with the Taliban, the United States may release several Afghan Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, according to a senior congressional official

The five prisoners are said to be 'hand-picked' by the Taliban preparing for the talks, claimed Fox News today.

Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that the administration’s efforts to talk with the Afghan Taliban smack of 'desperation.'

'Candidly, I don’t like the direction they are going in (with) reconciliation,'  Rogers said to Fox News.

He said after six years on the Committee looking at the issue, he felt it was an attempt to catch our on 'their policy of we're getting out.'

The senior congressional official who 
spoke to Fox News anonymously said money had been
spent to send the men to a third 
country.

The official added that the administration tried to abate concern by insisting they would not release all five Taliban leaders at once and said three would be swapped now and the others at a later date.

But as part of Tuesday's Senate 
intelligence hearing the head of the national counter-terrorism 
center, Matt Olsen, confirmed that 48 detainees were deemed too 
dangerous to release during the administration's 2009 review of the 
Guantanamo Detention camps and  the five Taliban detainees are among them.

'The Taliban asked for them specifically,' the senior congressional official said.

He went on to say they detainees who could be released had 'U.S. blood on their hands.'

Defence chief Leon Panetta arrives in Brussels yesterday for a defense ministers meeting which will discuss the future of Afghanistan

Prisoner swaps are usually dealt with after the peace terms are settled.

Yesterday,
Defence Secretary Leon Panetta laid out the administration's most 
explicit portrayal of the U.S. drawdown in Afghanistan, saying that U.S.
and other international forces in Afghanistan expect to end their 
combat role in 2013 and continue a training and advisory role with 
Afghan forces through 2014.

Panetta's
remarks to reporters traveling with him to a NATO defense ministers 
meeting in Brussels showed how the foreign military role in Afghanistan 
is expected to evolve from the current high-intensity fight against the 
Taliban to a support role with Afghans fully in the lead.

Defence Secretary Panetta recently announced said the U.S. could end its formal combat role in Afghanistan 18 months from now

Meanwhile the Taliban have dismissed reports they are preparing to talk peace with the Afghan government, and a leaked NATO report has shown captured insurgents full of confidence they will seize power after international troops leave.

While both developments yesterday were setbacks to President Hamid Karzai's quest to broker peace with the Taliban, his government got a big boost from Pakistan's top diplomat who declared her nation's support for an Afghan-led reconciliation process.

Pakistan's Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said she was visiting Kabul to deliver the strong message that Pakistan would stand behind any peace initiative that was widely supported by all ethnic groups in Afghanistan.

'Our only prerequisite to be supportive of an initiative is that it should be Afghan-led,' she said. 'It should be Afghan-owned. It should be Afghan-driven and Afghan-backed.'

Rumours have swirled for days that Karzai's government was seeking direct talks with the Taliban in Saudi Arabia - a move seen as Karzai's attempt to take charge of the peace effort.

A statement Wednesday from Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid rejected those reports as 'baseless.

Khar's visit to Kabul came on the same day a classified NATO
report was leaked, claiming that the Taliban believe they will return to power
after the U.S.-led coalition ends its combat role in Afghanistan in 2014.

The
report, which was based on the interrogation of more than 4,000 captured
Taliban, al-Qaida and foreign fighters, was obtained by the BBC and other news
organizations.

According to excerpts of the report obtained by the BBC, the
Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence is "thoroughly aware of Taliban
activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban personnel. The Haqqani
family, for example, resides immediately west of the ISI office at the airfield
in Miram Shah, Pakistan," the report said.

Khar dismissed the allegations in the report as 'old wine
in an even older bottle. I don't think these claims are new.'

Nick Witney, a former head of the European Defense Agency,
said the report indicated the morale of Taliban fighters remained extremely
high after 10 years of war - and in spite of a massive military effort mounted
by the U.S. and its NATO allies in the past two years.

'The report does confirm what has been increasingly
obvious for a number of years - that this Afghan operation has turned into a
great misadventure for the West,' said Witney, a senior policy fellow at
the Paris-based European Council on Foreign Relations.

Pentagon spokesman Capt. John Kirby told reporters that the
U.S. would like to see ties severed between some elements of Pakistani
intelligence and militant groups.

'That's not a strategic decision that we get to make -
that's a strategic decision that folks in the ISI need to make.'

NATO officials cautioned that the report was a summary of
interrogations and was not based on an intelligence analysis.
