Finding out that the father of your children is cheating on you is heart-breaking, but when the person he is doing the dirty with is your own mother, the deceit is enough to shatter your world. 

Kylie, 26, from Sheffield is still struggling to come to terms with the betrayal of the two adults she loved most in the world, after learning that they conducted an affair behind her back that lasted at least two and a half years. 

The mother-of-two has now told her story in a new Channel 5 documentary called Wedding Disaster Specials which airs tonight at 8pm, in an attempt to help others who may be going through a similar situation.

Kylie, 26, from Sheffield is still struggling to overcome her mother's betrayal. Her mum admitted recently that she had long affair with her daughter's fiancé. The relationship took place while Kylie was pregnant

Kylie first met her partner, who we shall call Dean, just over five years ago on social media. 

The pair started messaging each other daily and it wasn't long before romance blossomed.

Dean and Kylie first met face-to-face at her 21st birthday, which took place in a pub in Sheffield. 

She said: 'He made me smile, he made me laugh, I felt like I was walking on a cloud constantly. 

'From there we ended up in a relationship.'

Just five months later, the couple had moved in together and for the first three years of their relationship, everything ran smoothly.  

For Kylie's 24th birthday, which also marked three years to the day since she and Dean got together, they held a party at the pub where they first met. 

During the party, which was attended by all of her family and close friends, Dean surprised her by getting down on one knee and asking her to marry him.

Kylie said: 'I had never been so happy to share that moment with people I held close. It was a very good night.

'And then, two or three weeks later, we found out we were pregnant. 

'I felt like I had it all, the man I love and a baby on the way - everything felt like it was falling into place.' 

But soon afterwards, Dean's behaviour started to change and he became more controlling. 

He would demand to know wherever she was going and would call her phone every hour on the hour, sometimes turning unannounced if she was out with friends to check on her. 

According to Kylie, his drinking also increased and he would become argumentative, picking fights at any opportunity. 

She turned to her mother, who we shall call Shirley, for support and Shirley started to come over to the house on a regular basis. 

Kylie said: 'My mum managed to calm him down, she had an amazing effect on him.

'I used to look forward to her coming around because she was my only female friend and I could talk to her about anything from shopping to twinges in my pregnancy and relationship problems.'

When Kylie's baby arrived, her mother started staying over on a regular basis to help out. 

But a few weeks after the birth, she became suspicious after discovering her mother and boyfriend watching a porn DVD together.  

She said: 'I'd gone to bed early, my daughter woke up about 12 for a bottle so I gave her one and I heard a DVD on the TV, which I thought sounded like it was a porn DVD. 

'When I came through the door, I saw it was a porn DVD and that my partner and my mum were sat on the settee watching it.

'When I confronted them, they said it was something that had just started and they had put the wrong DVD in.

'They said that I was insecure and paranoid because I've just had a baby and that I was imagining things.

'The next morning it was as though nothing had happened.

'I spoke to my friends and they said, "Are you sure? Your mum has been happily married for 27 years."

'I convinced myself I was believing things that weren't happening. I went to the doctors and they put me on antidepressants.

'But the tablets made me quite drowsy and having a newborn in the house meant it wasn't safe for me to be on my own.'

The drowsiness from the tablets meant her mother was around the house constantly to help out.

Kylie put her worries to the back of her mind though, especially after her next round of big news a couple of months later - that she was expecting again. This time it was a baby boy.

After the child was born, Kylie and Dean started to argue, with one row ending with him throwing a colander at her. Kylie kicked him out, but her mother convinced her that the relationship was worth another try. 

She said: 'My mum was such a strong believer in him that I thought if she can believe in him, surely I should.

'So we went for a meal and laughed and joked about things and it was as though we had gone back to the begining of our relationship.

'I took him back and he moved back in. Things were fantastic. 

'He was the person I fell in love with, he was fantastic around the kids, they loved having him back home. 

'It was just magical.

'We went on our first holiday to Blackpool, it was our first holiday as a family and it was brilliant. We sat on the beach and had chips and ice cream. 

'At that point I thought this is what families are supposed to do. 

'I thought everything was perfect and my mum was right to believe in him.'

But then Kylie's mother started to visit the house regularly again and Dean became quiet and withdrawn. 

After a conversation with Shirley about his mood swings, her mother said she would deal with Dean and convinced her daughter to join a gym.

But one day, while Kylie was at the house, she noticed he mother's mobile phone lying around and decided to take a look. 

She said: 'I thought I would have a look on her phone, just to ease my mind more than anything.

'There was one message from him to her saying, "I'll do you tonight," and there were no other text messages.

'At that point I decided I wouldn't go to the gym, I'd come back instead and catch them out.

'When I got home, it took me at least 15 minutes to get back into the house because his keys were in the door.

'When I eventually managed to get into the house, my mum was in the shower and he was in his boxer shorts.

'I didn't want it to be true, I mean, she was my mum and he was my lifetime partner who I thought I would settle down with and get married to.' 

After that, Dean and Kylie split up, but her mother continued to deny anything had happened. 

Then three months ago, Shirley finally confessed. 

Kylie said: 'I was actually sat at the table with children and my mum was sat across from me. 

'She was on her phone and then she looked at me and said, "I've got something to tell you and you're not going to like it - me and him have been sleeping together."

'If the children weren't there, I'd have slapped her.'

The next day a letter dropped through her door from her solicitor, it contained a confession from Dean that he had been sleeping with her mother for four years. 

Kylie realised that the only reason her mother had told her the truth was because she knew she was going to get found out through Dean's confession the next day. 

She said: 'I couldn't believe that my mum did the ultimate betrayal. 'My mum was my best friend, hopefully she might get back there. But once you break that trust, it's hard to get it back.'

When Channel 5 contacted Kylie's mother, she said she had an-off relationship with her daughter's ex for two and a half years but denied watching porn with him and claimed nothing happened on the night that Kylie came back to the house to catch them out.

Kylie's ex said he did not want to take part in the programme.

Wedding Disaster Specials: He Left Me For My Mother... And Other Betrayals airs tonight on Channel 5 at 8pm.
