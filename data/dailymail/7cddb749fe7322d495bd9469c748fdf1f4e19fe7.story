For 16 years, she has been the voice of morning news and debate on the BBC’s Radio 5 Live.

Yesterday, Victoria Derbyshire hosted her popular current affairs show for the last time, prompting a flood of tributes from loyal listeners.

And now, on the brink of making the leap to TV with a daily programme on BBC News, she has revealed that behind her success lies a difficult childhood which gave her the courage to ‘be bold to anyone’.

She told listeners yesterday: ‘I have loved talking to you over the last 16 years, and even more I have loved listening to you. You have told me so many things about your lives which I will never, ever forget and for which I’m very grateful.’

An uneasy relationship: Miss Derbyshire, pictured as a small child with her father Anthony, claims he was an ‘aggressive’ man who abused her, her mother and her younger brother and sister

The mother-of-two revealed her troubled childhood as she makes her way from radio to BBC News, but her father Anthony, 77, has denied he ever hit his children 

But the Radio Academy Award winner has recently shared details of her own early life which could match many a phone-in.

Her father Anthony was an ‘aggressive’ man who abused her, her mother and her younger brother and sister, she claimed.

Mother-of-two Miss Derbyshire, 45, said: ‘It was very much us four against him. He was aggressive and violent and not loving in any way. Not like a father should be.’ She described rushing to make him a cup of tea after work or ‘there would be all hell to pay’, and slipping her mother’s Valium into his tea hoping to ‘calm him down’.

Asked if the tactic worked, she said: ‘I didn’t monitor it. I should have taken notes, “Today, one Valium, no row; today, no Valium, he threw a pan at mum’s head”.’

She described her mother Pauline, 74, as ‘absolutely brilliant’. The siblings tried to protect her, she claimed, by sitting at the top of the stairs to listen to parental rows.

She said: ‘[We were] thinking “we don’t know what to do, but we’ll stay awake because if we’re awake, at least that is somehow going to protect her because we’ll know what is happening”. Though I don’t know what we thought we’d do with the information.’

Once she ran to get police because she thought her father was beating her mother, who was locked in a bedroom. But she claimed officers spoke to her father, who was ‘utterly charming’, and left ‘having had a cup of tea’. Her parents divorced in 1985 when she was 17 – a moment she called a ‘liberation’ – and her mother remarried her ‘amazing’ late stepfather Des Whitehead.

In the interview with The Guardian last month, Miss Derbyshire said: ‘My attitude now is that I have no feelings towards him, because I don’t want to waste any energy on him.

‘I think when I first had children, that’s when I really understood the depths to which he had sunk – your own child, how can you hit them?’

She put her fearless style – which has seen her grill her boss, former 5 Live controller Adrian Van Klaveren, and put former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke on the spot over his views on rape victims – down to resilience she learnt growing up.

‘I remember being bold to my father and feeling I was sticking up for myself and for us, and so, in comparison to that, I think I can be bold to anyone,’ she said.

Mr Derbyshire, 77, insisted he had never hit his children and said their childhood in an eight-bedroom Tudor mansion in Lancashire, now worth £2.5million, was ‘brilliant’.

He admits striking his ex-wife, claiming she was aggressive to him. He said: ‘She implies she was dragged up in a tough northern environment – rubbish. She was brought up in the lap of luxury: elocution lessons, dance lessons, private school.’ Mr Derbyshire, a retired director of several companies, added: ‘I was working away a lot, sometimes at weekends.

‘When I went home I just wanted peace and quiet. I used to talk to them reasonably when they did something wrong, not shout and rave at them as she says. I wasn’t all cuddly and that sort of thing, but I was loving in the sense I provided for them and worked very, very hard to give them everything.’

He has lost touch with his three children but displays their photographs and school projects at his council flat near Bury. Miss Derbyshire’s only recent contact with her father was a series of emails in 2009 and 2010 asking him to come on her morning talk show to discuss domestic violence.

He declined, but said his daughter was ‘very good at her job’. He added: ‘I have never held a grudge. She’s living her life now, I’m living mine. But it is sad really, very sad.’

In a statement, Miss Derbyshire said: ‘Society knows that abusers nearly always deny their behaviour. It’s incredibly disappointing, but not surprising, that he is seeking to continue his abuse by attacking and blaming the people he once targeted.’ Miss Derbyshire joined Radio 5 Live as co-presenter of the breakfast show 16 years ago and in 2004 took over the morning news.

She ended her final programme with a tearful message: ‘It’s time to say farewell, and it is farewell rather than goodbye … And of course I would like to say thank you to you.’

In a tweet, she said BBC director general Tony Hall had thanked her. She said: ‘Bit of a shock when the Director General walked in studio at end & said a few words!’
