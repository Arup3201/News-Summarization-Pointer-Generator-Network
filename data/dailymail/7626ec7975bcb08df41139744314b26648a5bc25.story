A 2-year-old girl died after an allegedly drunk driver crashed into her family's Louisiana home early Friday morning.

Tony Milligan, 20, was driving a Chevrolet Silverado on the highway when he hit the back of a Honda Accord, Louisiana State Police said in a release. The other driver, 20-year-old Bao Luu, was not injured.

Milligan left the accident and kept driving, before he lost control of the car and it crashed into a Schriever home at 2:30am, police said.

Taylor Strickland, 2, who was inside the home, 'suffered serious injuries and was transported to Thibodaux Regional Hospital where she later died due to her injuries,' police said in the release.

Her parents, Brittany Strickland, 24, and Lance Strickland, 25, are in stable condition, police said. Milligan suffered minor injuries from the crash into the family's home.

Louisiana State Police said a blood sample was taken from Milligan for analysis. He faces vehicular homicide, careless operation, and no seat belt charges.

Lance Strickland mourned his daughter's when he spoke to Houma Today.

'Every day when I came home from work, I'd put my key in the door and I'd hear her little footsteps running toward me and her voice screaming "Daddy!"' he said. 'My little girl she was an angel on earth, and I won't have that anymore.'

Strickland told the paper his son and three nephews, who slept in the living room, were uninjured. He said the crash caused Taylor to fly almost 40 feet from her brother's room to the living room couch.

'I can't believe that a 20-year-old kid that wasn't able to drink yet was drinking and driving and caused me to lose my baby girl,' Strickland also said. 'That's the worst thing about this is that somebody was out there having a good night, and it caused us to have a nightmare. My little girl didn't deserve that.'

A GoFundMe account has been established to pay for his daughter's funeral expenses.
