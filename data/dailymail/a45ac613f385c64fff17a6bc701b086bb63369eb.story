Graeme Souness believes the time is right to take on an England side who routinely fail to make a positive impression on him and are bereft of the type of class the former Scotland midfielder was accustomed to going into Auld Enemy battles.

Roy Hodgson’s ‘disappointing’ outfit have been unable to excite Souness this year — with their World Cup Finals exit in the summer confirmed just eight days into the tournament after defeats to Italy and Uruguay.

The 3-1 win over Slovenia at Wembley may have continued England’s 100 per cent start to Euro 2016 qualifying but the fact they’ve been pitched in with less illustrious opposition in Group E means Souness is far from impressed.

Scotland beat Ireland and Souness reckons they can trouble the English at Celtic Park

The former manager-turned-pundit would love to feel underwhelmed by their work once again on Tuesday night at Celtic Park. For that would mean resurgent Scotland stand a terrific chance of gaining revenge for a 3-2 friendly defeat at Wembley last August and confirm there is no great gulf in quality between the two national teams in this era. 

‘They have been disappointing,’ said Souness of the current English crop. ‘This England team are more than beatable. It’s a great time to be playing them. I don’t see them as one of the strongest teams out there right now. 

‘In the last World Cup, I know people got excited about the first game against Italy. I didn’t. At no time did I get on the edge of my seat thinking: “England are playing well here, they’re going to win a game”. They didn’t excite me.

‘I think England went to Brazil and tried to play like Spain. They didn’t play to their strengths. Their strengths are up and at ’em and playing at a certain tempo but I didn’t see that. And people like me, other professionals in the game, are not excited by it either.

Souness holds some forthright views

‘I think they will obviously qualify out of their group — and they’ve got to. They’re a nation of 55 million, so they’ve got to start making an impression at a tournament. I happen to think England has enough good players to do that, some very good players. Any great players? Not sure about that.

‘We’ll know how big the gulf is on Tuesday. We’re at home and I think it will be a close encounter. We’re organised right now, everyone knows what they’re doing. There’s always an element when we play England that we feel like underdogs. I personally never felt that but I think there’s an element of that with our players. 

‘You want to run out at Hampden — or in this case Parkhead — with the crowd believing in you. That’s as much as you can ask. Right now, we’re at that stage — and we have a chance. I can see us giving a really good account of ourselves against England.’

Souness played in six Auld Enemy clashes during an international career which spanned 12 years and brought him 54 caps, tasting victory over England just once. That came in torrential rain at Hampden in 1985 when a second-half Richard Gough goal sealed a 1-0 win. 

That record leads Souness to claim ‘selective memory’ of the contests but he does recall slotting a penalty past Peter Shilton a year later in his final England clash as Scotland went down 2-1 in London.

Glenn Hoddle, Bryan Robson and Ray Wilkins were among his midfield rivals from that period in a strong squad that went on to reach the 1986 World Cup quarter-finals then the last four at Italia ’90.

There are precious few players available to Hodgson these days whom Souness could rank that highly in terms of stature. Indeed, when asked to nominate current England players with what he would regard as leadership qualities, Souness required pause for thought before he said: ‘Wayne Rooney is an obvious one.

‘He doesn’t like to lose. He’ll relish coming to Parkhead with the atmosphere and the abuse he’ll get. Who else is there? I think Gary Cahill is fast developing into a top centre-half. I was an enormous fan of Steven Gerrard but he’s no longer there. So I think they are the two obvious ones — Cahill and Rooney.’ 

Wayne Rooney is one player England can rely on, and will thrive in the cauldron of hate at Parkhead

James Milner remained on the bench for the duration of England’s win at Wembley 15 months ago but Souness argues that the Manchester City midfielder should be rewarded with more starts.

That praise is a measure of Milner’s progress since being sidelined as a Newcastle United player under Souness nine years ago. The Scot famously commented then that his rebuilding plans for improving Newcastle did not include ‘buying a team of James Milners’.

The wide man, then an England Under 21 player, has since revealed that those words motivated him and dealing with the upset helped keep him mentally strong for the career challenges which followed. 

Perhaps the most undervalued English player, Milner now impresses Souness. ‘I really like him,’ he said. ‘He’d be one of the first on the team sheet for me — both at Man City and with England. He’s improved greatly in his time at City. Apart from being a workaholic, he’s now added quality to his game.’

Souness won 54 Scotland caps and enjoyed victory over England once in six attempts in 1985

Souness never harboured any doubts about the quality of Darren Fletcher from a young age and is desperate to see the 30-year-old, who missed 18 months of football battling a serious bowel condition, overcome the bumps in his comeback road for Scotland and Manchester United.

Fletcher has faded from starting contention this season, playing only one minute for his club since a second-half substitute appearance for Scotland in Poland last month.

‘It would please me to see Darren playing on Tuesday,’ said Souness. ‘You go back three years and, under Sir Alex Ferguson, he would’ve been the first name on the team sheet — especially in the really big games. 

‘He was a proper midfield player and had a bit of everything — great athleticism, aggression, chipped in with not a lot of goals but goals. No one knows how illness will affect you but the fact he’s back playing is encouraging. 

‘It might take him another six months, it might take another year. A fit Darren Fletcher gets into any England team, certainly the player that we saw three years ago.’
