A bank in Canada has been surprising its loyal customers after setting up an ATM - Automated Thanking Machine - which dispensed personal gifts.

At the end of last month, TD bank invited a few of its longest standing customers into branches across Canada for a special experience.

Pretending they were there to try a new ATM, the bank then filmed as the machine dispensed flights to visit relatives, tickets to Disney, and the chance to throw the first pitch at a baseball game.

The rewarding day was part of an initiative by the bank to say thank you to its customers.

As well as the personalized gifts, more than 20,000 Canadians who bank with TD were given a cash reward, in a simultaneous handover that took place in branches, online and over the phone at 2pm.

'It was incredible to see the look of surprise on our customers' faces,' branch manager Ester Condello said.

'We say thank you to our customers every day, and we'll say thank you tomorrow and the next day. Today's thank you is about all of us at TD working together to shout it from the rooftops.'

But the biggest reward was reserved for a select few loyal customers who were handpicked by staff.

From Dorothy, who was given tickets to Trinidad so she could visit her only daughter who is battling cancer, to mom-of-two Christine, who was given savings accounts with $1,000 in each for her children, the bank showed it paid attention to customers' lives.

As well as the savings head start for her children, Christine was also given tickets to take them to Disney; and Dorothy was given a heartfelt thanks for her generous nature.

One loyal customer, Mike Jobin, was treated to an array of baseball gifts, from a catcher's mitt and personalized team jersey to a surprise meeting with a Blue Jays player.

In a final flourish of gift-giving to Jobin at his Pickering, Ontario branch, he was told he would be throwing the first pitch at the Jays' game that weekend.

'I can't believe TD did this - it's something that I'll never forget,' he said. 'We're a real baseball family and making the first pitch at a Blue Jays game was at the top of my bucket list. I had goosebumps the whole time!'

The reactions of Jobin and the other lucky customers was captured in a YouTube video, that has been viewed more than 7.4 million times since July 24.
