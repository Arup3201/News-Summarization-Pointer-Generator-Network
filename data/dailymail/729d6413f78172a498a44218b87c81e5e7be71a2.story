An 86-year-old man who shot himself 
dead in the toilet of a doctor's surgery was struggling to cope with his wife's
 illness, it was claimed today.

The pensioner has been named locally as Brian
 Poingdestre and is believed to have turned a revolver on himself out of 
loneliness since his wife has been ill in hospital.

Armed police were scrambled to the scene 
following reports of gunfire and a 'sudden death' at the GP practice in 
Frimley, Surrey.

Tragic: The 86-year-old shot himself dead in Station Road Doctor's Surgery in Frimley, Surrey, yesterday

In
 the first clue to Mr Poingdestre's motives, a resident near the scene 
said the gunman was 'quite lonely' because his wife Barbara was in 
hospital.

The woman, who 
asked not to be named, said: 'He was quite lonely because his wife is in
 Frimley Park Hospital - she is very poorly.

'She wouldn't have a clue what happened yesterday.

'His
 car was parked on the double yellows outside the surgery yesterday - 
which makes me think he drove in a hurry from the hospital.

'I've no idea if he was a patient there or not though.

'From the sounds of things, he used a hand gun - an old service revolver.'

Neighbours paid tribute to Mr Poingdestre, who they described as a 'quiet' man who 'couldn't cope'.

Dennis Kinchen, 70, and Georgina Kinchen, 64, live across from the Poingdestre's semi-detached family home of more than 40 years.

Mrs Kinchen, from Frimley, said: 'I don't think Brian could cope with Barbara getting ill.

'He seemed quite nice and always said hello and stopped to talk about the garden, but he was quite quiet recently.

'I know she hasn't been well.

Scene: The man, named locally as Brian Poingdestre, is thought to have parked his car outside beforehand

'Back in January an ambulance was at the house after she fell over in the garden and banged her head quite badly.

'Her head was covered in blood and they took her away but it was a while before the paramedics came.

'I haven't seen Barbara for a while - I know she's ill but she may or may not be in hospital.'

Mr
 Poingdestre used to park his car on the grass outside the end-of-road 
property, which has a white wooden gate by the front path.

The front garden is large and the back has a bird table and washing line, visible from the road.

Mr Kinchen said he thought Mr Poingdestre had been 'lonely' and 'couldn't cope' with his wife's ill health.

Mr Kinchen said: 'He was a nice guy but pretty quiet. We've lived here about 20 years so you'd think we'd know more about him.

'We didn't even know he had kids but he does have a son called Guy who's about 60-odd.

'We've never seen him come to the house though in all the time we've been here.

'I do think he was just lonely and couldn't cope.'

The Poingdestres had one son who was believed to be heading up from the Weymouth area of Dorset today.

'He was a nice guy but quite quiet recently. I think he just couldn't cope when Barbara got ill'

Gavin Laming, who runs Gavin's Hair Studio, barely 200 yards from the couple's home, has been doing Barbara Poingdestre's hair every week for the last 10 years.

He said of yesterday's events: 'It's horrendous. I can't get over it. I don't know what's happened, if it's got too much for him. I can't believe he went to the doctor's surgery and did this.'

He said Mrs Poingdestre was 'a lovely, lovely lady' but again that she and her husband were private people.

He too had heard she had fallen over a concrete slab in her garden, resulting in being hospitalised.

Jas Dhaliwal, who runs JR Wines general store next door, said: 'He was a nice bloke. I think he just couldn't cope.

'He did say he was a bit upset with his wife being in hospital but there was nothing to suggest this would happen.'

Mr Poingdestre was a regular customer of his, he said.

'He came and got his veg, a banana, whether he needed a potato or a couple of carrots.

'When I opened the shop the was quite happy because he said: "We couldn't get our veg here in the past", because he only ever needed a couple of bits.'

He said Mr Poingdestre was just a nice, normal old man, who was friendly and respectable, up early in the morning 'like any other pensioner'.

Like others in the area, however, he knew very little about the tragic couple.

The Poingdestres' immediate neighbours said they have been living next to Brian and Barbara for years.

Investigation: Armed police were scrambled to the scene following reports of gunfire at the GP practice

A car with number plates covered parked very close to Station Road Surgery, where a man shot himself dead

The victim in his 80s was believed to have driven the car to the surgery, walked in and shot himself dead

A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'They were just a normal couple really.

'We weren't exactly close neighbours - passed the time of day when we saw them but that wasn't often.

'Barbara hasn't been well for a long time - she didn't want to tell us much about it which I understand.

'I think it's age related problems - you know, the problems that come as you get older.

'I saw him last week and he looked OK but I didn't get a chance to speak to him.

'They have a son but he hasn't lived here for a long time - we wouldn't know the reason why.'

A
 practice manager at Station Road Surgery declined to comment on the 
incident or say whether he shot himself after an appointment.

Mr Poingdestre is believed to be a patient at the surgery.

Other patients claimed only someone who knew their way around the building would find the toilets.

A worker at The Mane Street barbers opposite the surgery said the community was in a 'sombre mood' today.

Patients
 have been flocking to the surgery after it re-opened today - all 
appointments were cancelled due to the incident at about 11am yesterday.

The
 woman, who asked not to be named, said: 'The police have moved off the 
scene now and patients have been filing into the doctor's all morning.

'People are in a very sombre mood this morning - I certainly feel terribly sad thinking about the poor man who died.

'There's been no word on who he is yet so we're hoping he's not one of our customers.'

Surrey Police, who investigated the shooting, said they have passed a file to the coroner.

The Ford Focus, parked on a double yellow line with its number plate covered up, has now been removed

Officers were stationed outside the surgery all day yesterday and all appointments were cancelled

A
 spokeswoman confirmed an 86-year-old man, from Frimley, Surrey, had 
died but said his death was not being treated as suspicious.

His next-of-kin have been informed and a post mortem is due to be carried out later this week.

A
 statement said: 'Officers and other emergency services attended the 
location after receiving reports, just before 11am, that a firearm had 
been discharged within the building.

'The local man was pronounced dead at the scene.

'The death is not being treated as suspicious.

'The next of kin have been informed.'

Surrey Coroner's office are expected to open and adjourn an inquest into the death in the next few days.

Staff at the surgery, which re-opened today, are being offered support from NHS England.

A
 spokesperson for NHS England said: 'We are supporting staff at the 
Station Road Surgery, Frimley, following the sudden death on the 
premises.

'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the man who died.

'Surrey Police are carrying out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death.

'The surgery is open to patients as normal.'

Police were called to the surgery in Station Road, Frimley, Surrey, at about 10.30am yesterday morning

Shocked residents near the Station Road Surgery said they heard 'gunshots' from inside

Yesterday, a police officer stood guard at the entrance to the sealed-off surgery and a cordon was set up around its car park.

Another police officer was stationed by a silver Ford Focus ST parked just 25 yards from the surgery entrance, believed to be Mr Poingdestre's car.

Witness Ed Tse, 25, said he heard 'a bang like a gunshot' while working in his father's Chinese takeaway which backs onto the surgery.

He described the aftermath at the scene as 'chaotic'.

Mr Tse, from Frimley, said: 'I heard a bang around 10.30am and at first I thought it sounded like the bins being collected.

'The surgery is always throwing stuff out so hearing the bang of a bin is quite common but this was louder.

'I went around the corner and there were lots of people and police cars around - it was chaotic.

'I did think the noise was much louder than the usual bin noise and it sounded like a gunshot.

'I've not heard much since but I saw people coming in and out as I came on to Station Road and staff were having to show IDs to police on the door.

'Police were not letting anyone in or out and were taking statements and telling people the surgery was close. I haven't spoken to police myself yet.'
