Arsenal midfielder Abou Diaby has revealed he considered retiring over his latest injury hell.

Diaby played just 16 minutes of football last season in the final league game against Norwich, spending the entire year recovering from a serious knee injury sustained during the 2012/13 campaign.

The midfielder's career has been cursed by injuries, accumulating 39 different problems since joining in 2006.

And the Frenchman has admitted the idea of hanging up his boots did cross his mind as he fought his latest injury setback.

'Did I consider quitting? Yes, sometimes it crossed my mind but my love of football is so big that I just couldn't quit,' he said

'I am still young and now that I have an opportunity to play again I want to take it.

'It's great to be playing again and it's a good feeling. I am just happy to be back and playing. Now I just hope I can keep like this and continue playing.'

Diaby has played a part in both of Arsenal's pre-season friendlies so far and can expect more action in the Emirates Cup.

And the 28-year-old insists his knee is causing him no problems, saying: 'It is feeling good, I have been working hard on my fitness and strength.

'It's been hard, I have been doing so much work to make sure I am ready. That has taken up most of my summer but it has been good because now I am in a position where I can play games. 

'I have done the same kind of rehab as before but this time I have been working to make sure my fitness levels were where they should be for when I come back to play matches at the start of pre-season.

'Will I be like a new signing? I guess so, but they have said that many times before. Now it's just important for me to be back and able to play. 

'I am really confident and optimistic that I will be able to stay injury free. I have worked hard for over a year now.'
