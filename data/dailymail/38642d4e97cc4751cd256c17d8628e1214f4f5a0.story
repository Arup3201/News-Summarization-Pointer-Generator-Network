We have all been there, spending mornings wrestling with builders' bums, saggy bottoms and muffin tops as we try and squeeze in to our jeans.

But at last the wait for the perfect pair may finally be over.

Marks & Spencer have launched a new style of denim for women which focuses on unique body shape rather than the standard body size most clothes are sold in.

Using revolutionary body scan measurements of over 10,000 
UK women, designers at the store have created the range which they claim will 
flatter the majority of women's body shapes.

The three styles have celebrity inspired names Eva, Lana and Marilyn (although the store denies naming them after specific women)  built specifically with pear, apple and hourglass figures in mind.

Research conducted 
for M&S found that 42% of women wear jeans at least five times a week 
and most women have between four and five pairs of jeans in their wardrobe 
they wear regularly. 

Despite them being our favourite wardrobe item most women surveyed 
feel that it is difficult to find a pair of jeans they feel 100%
comfortable in.

Each Body Shape Denim style is 
determined by the variations in waist to hip ratio. 

Measuring your
waist at the narrowest point and your hips at the widest, the style that will compliment your figure most will
be determined by subtracting your waist measurement from your hip.

Karl Knight, Head of Innovation and Quality said:  'As
the most worn items’ of clothing in the world, it is important that 
denim jeans offer our customer the most comfortable and flattering fit 
possible.

'In order to achieve this we have been working with 
internationally renowned body scanning technology to ensure that the 
measurements of our Body Shape Denim styles are designed to flatter all 
shapes and sizes.'

The three styles of Body Shape Denim for 
M&S Woman will be launched on 5th September 2012 in a straight leg, 
indigo wash in sizes 8-22. 

The jeans are priced at £25 with 3 leg 
length options; short, medium and long for optimum comfort and fit.
