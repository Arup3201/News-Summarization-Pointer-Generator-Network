The average wedding might cost £18,000 - but thrifty bride Debbie Taylor, 42, from Penrhys in Wales managed to throw her bash for just £1,000.

Savings included swapping fresh flowers for plastic ones, ordering a dress from China via eBay and picking up suits in the M&S sale.

Catering for the 60 guest who attended the reception, which took place at the Ystrad Rhondda Labour Club, cost nothing as it was done entirely by family members.

'We got engaged 20 years ago,' said Debbie, who has a daughter, Stacey, 23, and son Nathan, 18, with her new husband.

'But I kept saying no to getting married. I didn’t want to get into mountains of debt just because of one, albeit special, day.'

Statistics show the average wedding costs £18,244, with brides spashing out £2,164 on a venue, £2,770 on catering, £876 on a photographer.

An additional £728 is spent on flowers and cake and yet more on honeymoon, rings, shoes and outfits for bridesmaids and ushers.

Debbie brought her costs down with a £100 eBay wedding dress, lots of DIY and a family-catered reception for 60 after the ceremony at Llanfair Church in Penrhys.

A friend paid another friend to style Debbie’s hair, and she did her make-up herself, while her brother Wayne took the photos.

'It was the day of our dreams,' said an overjoyed Debbie. 'Weddings don’t need to cost a fortune - they just need family and friends.

Debbie, a community engagement worker, and council groundsman Mark borrowed £1,000 for the wedding from Dragon Savers Credit Union in Treorchy for the wedding.

This month, the Credit Unions of Wales launched a Welsh Government-backed campaign to encourage people in Wales to choose a community alternative to banks.
