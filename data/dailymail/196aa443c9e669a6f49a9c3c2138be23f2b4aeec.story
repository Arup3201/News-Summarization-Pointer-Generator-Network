Public health officials said trout from the River Kennet (pictured) should not be eaten amid fears a pesticide has leached into the water

Public health officials are warning people to avoid contact with water from one of Britain's most famous fishing rivers over fears it has been contaminated by a pesticide. 

The Environment Agency says it is 
investigating a 'serious pollution' incident on the River Kennet and said people should not allow the water to touch their skin or eat trout caught from the river.

There are fears a pesticide has leached into the water between Marlborough and Hungerford on the Wiltshire-Berkshire 
border.

Tests on the water revealed that invertebrates have disappeared, sparking fears for wildlife further up the food chain. 

The
Kennet is world-famous in angling circles for the purity of its water 
and the fatness of its trout, and there are syndicates along the river 
near Hungerford where 'rods' pay up to £3,000 a season for their sport.

Pupils
at Marlborough College, where the Duchess of Cambridge was taught, are 
offered trout-fishing lessons on the stretch of Kennet which flows 
through the grounds.

Campaigners
from the Action for the River Kennet group say they first became 
alarmed last month by the increasingly murky state of the  water.

ARK director Charlotte Hitchmough said: 'The water had been a funny colour for a long time, caused by an algal bloom, and we were watching it carefully as it was a cause for concern.

'Then suddenly on Sunday, the water went clear. At first we were very pleased but then we tested the water and found that all the invertebrates - the bugs that the fish and birds eat - had disappeared.'

She said the issue is on a 10-mile stretch of the river downstream from a sewage treatment works.

Ms Hitchmough said: 'Those little bugs at the bottom of the river are so important. It would be like killing all the grass in a field so the cows had nothing to eat.

'At the moment we don't know where this pollution has come from.'

A spokesman for the Environment 
Agency, which launched an investigation on Tuesday, said: 'The pollution
has now stopped and we are investigating the cause and the source of 
the pollutant.

'Environment officers have taken soil samples and ecology samples to help us identify the source.'

Environment Agency said there was a 'serious pollution' incident on the river between Malborough and Hungerford

The Environment Agency said officers have been investigating the source of the pollution, believed to be chlorpyrifos, a common agricultural pesticide, and have been taking samples to assess the impact on the water quality.

'Investigations have shown that many macro-invertebrates have been killed, but there have been no reports so far of any fish killed,' the agency said in a statement yesterday.

Public Health England, working in partnership with the Environment Agency and Wiltshire and West Berkshire Councils, has advised the public to avoid skin contact with the water in the river until the exact concentrations and impacts of the pesticide have been determined.

People are also being advised not to fish or to eat any fish caught in the affected stretch of the river until there is more information about exactly what has caused the pollution.

Martin Salter MP, the Angling Trust's campaigns coordinator, said: 'We want to know why on earth a lethal chemical like chlorpyriphos is allowed to be used anywhere near a river or watercourse.

'Apparently the 15km wipe out of invertebrates between Marlborough and Hungerford may have been caused by as little as a couple of spoonfuls of the stuff. If this is the case then the sooner we follow the lead of Singapore and America and ban it the better.'
