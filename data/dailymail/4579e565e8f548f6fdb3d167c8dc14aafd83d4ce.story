A rapid shift to wind and solar power is needed if the world is to avoid catastrophic global warming, the United Nations warns in a crucial report today.

Emissions of greenhouse gases need to be cut by up to 70 per cent before 2050 to control climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says.

‘Large-scale changes in energy systems’ are required, with coal power stations to be switched off and replaced by wind and solar.

CCS refers to the process of capturing carbon released by burning fossil fuels and storing it in porous rock layers in areas such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs

And the transformation needs to be made in the next 15 years or 
controlling climate change will become increasingly harder and more 
expensive.

The report was published in Berlin today after a week of line-by-line drafting and re-drafting.

The
 final version, written by 235 international scientists and economists, 
says that efforts so far have failed to stop spiralling emissions of 
greenhouse gases – which have risen to ‘unprecedented levels’ in the 
past decade.

Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chair of the authors, said: ‘There 
is a clear message from science: to avoid dangerous interference with 
the climate system, we need to move away from business as usual.’

The IPCC report is the first major assessment in seven years of the options for dealing with climate change.

It
 will inform the policy decisions of Governments around the world, and 
vitally, will also be used as bargaining tool before next year’s UN 
climate conference in Paris, which aims to set legally binding targets 
on every nation to reduce carbon emissions.

It is the final part in a trilogy of IPCC reports on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change.

The
 first part, published last September, found that scientists are 95 per 
cent certain that humans are the ‘dominant cause’ of global warming.

The
 second part, published a fortnight ago, warned that the drastic impacts
 of climate change are ‘already occurring on all continents and across 
the oceans’.

The final part, published today on the options for 
mitigating global warming, warns that we must drastically reduce our use
 of fossil fuels.

The report warns: ‘Without additional efforts to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond those in place today, emissions 
growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and 
economic activities.’

If no action is taken, global temperatures will
 rise by up to 4.7C by the end of the century, which scientists believe 
will cause irreversible and dramatic damage to the planet.

Global 
investment in fossil fuels will have to drop by £20billion a year until 
2030, while world investment in low-carbon alternatives will have to 
rise by £90billion a year.

Last year in Britain fossil fuels provided
 65 per cent of electricity, with nuclear providing 20 per cent and 
renewable sources providing 15 per cent.

The scientists are 
optimistic that if renewable energy is quickly rolled out, homes are 
built in a more sustainable and energy efficient way, and human 
consumption and wastefulness is changed, climate change can be 
controlled.

Transforming the economy will require ‘substantial investment’ – up to 4 per cent of total global GDP between now and 2030.

But
 the report authors argue that money would need to be spent on energy 
infrastructure anyway, and the additional spend will only slow growth by
 a tiny amount, no more than 0.14 of a percentage point.

Renewable energy has already started to expand , the report finds, but a rapid acceleration is now needed.

‘Regarding
 electricity generation alone, renewable energy accounted for just over 
half of the new electricity‐generating capacity added globally in 2012, 
led by growth in wind, hydro and solar power,’ it says.

But it warns that Governments will still need to pour subsidies in to get the systems off the ground.

Green power: The report, by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), also highlights an urgent need for governments to switch to green energy, such as wind (pictured) and solar power

‘Many
 renewable energy technologies still need direct and/or indirect 
support, if their market shares are to be significantly increased,’ it 
says.

Despite the focus on renewable energy, the scientists say 
natural gas still has a role to play for electricity production in a 
low-carbon world.

The assessment is an unexpected endorsement of the 
British Government’s drive to frack for shale gas, and a blow to the 
green lobby which opposes it.

The report says burning natural gas is a far cleaner method of energy production than burning coal.

Gas
 will act as a ‘bridge technology’ while renewable energy is expanded, a
 phase that could last until 2050. Beyond that it would be phased out – 
but may still play a role if carbon dioxide emissions could be trapped 
and stored underground.

The report says: ‘Greenhouse gas emissions 
from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current 
world average coal‐fired power plants with modern, highly efficient 
natural gas combined‐cycle power plants or combined heat and power 
plants, provided that natural gas is available and the fugitive 
emissions associated with extraction and supply are low or mitigated.’

Nuclear
 power could make an ‘increasing contribution to low-carbon energy 
supply’, the report finds, but the scientists warn that ‘operation 
risks’ such as disposing of radioactive waste mean there are a ‘variety 
of barriers and risks’.

The scientists also suggest that an 
experimental technology could be used to ‘suck’ carbon dioxide out of 
the air, as a last-ditch ‘Plan B’ if emissions are not cut in time.

The technology would work by using a little-tested system called BECCS –Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage.

It would involve growing crops that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere then burn them in a power station to generate energy.

The resulting emissions would then be captured at the plant and then stored underground.

The net effect of that process would result in CO2 is removed from the air.

Professor
 Edenhofer, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: 
‘Many different pathways lead to a future within the boundaries set by 
the 2C goal [beyond which global warming becomes difficult to control.

‘All
 of these require substantial investments. Avoiding further delays in 
mitigation and making use of a broad variety of technologies can limit 
the associated costs.’
