Barcelona forward Pedro believes that Chelsea could be major contenders for the Champions League after sealing the signing of Cesc Fabregas. 

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho splashed £27million to secure the Spaniard’s signature earlier this summer and he has since followed up that purchase with deals for Atletico Madrid pair Luis Filipe and Diego Costa.

Speaking at St Georges Park, where Barcelona are currently training ahead of the new season, Pedro spoke in glowing terms about his former team-mate and admitted that the Catalan side may miss Fabregas next season.

Provider: Pedro says Cesc Fabregas is a dream to play with for forwards because his passing is so good

‘Cesc is a great player, one of the best midfielders and he creates chances,’ the 27-year-old said, ‘For a forward, he is a great player to have. He will do really well at Chelsea.

‘He is a good friend of mine, not only here, but we were together with the national team. Chelsea will be difficult to beat in the Champions League because they have strengthened well and made some great signings.’

Pedro also praised the club’s new signing Luis Suarez and the Spaniard expressed his belief that the four month ban from all football - handed out by FIFA when the Uruguayan bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup - is too severe.

Barcelona have launched an appeal that will be heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in the middle of August and there is an increasing feeling in Catalonia that the ban could be softened to allow Suarez to train with his team-mates, while the club also harbour hopes that the duration of the ban could be lessened.

‘Suarez’s punishment seems excessive and we will see if it is reduced,’ Pedro said. ‘But we have to cope with it. He is coming here to work with everyone and he will be well received by the supporters if he works for the team and does well. He is one of the best forwards in the world.’

Pedro, now an established member of the Barcelona squad after graduating through the club’s La Masia academy several years ago, admits that his opportunities in the side could be limited with Suarez set to join up with Lionel Messi and Neymar in a fearsome front three.

Pedro, however, burst onto the scene when Samuel Eto’o and Zlatan Ibrahimovic were in town and he believes that he can still make a wholesome contribution to the Barcelona cause.

He does, however, admit that he considered making a fresh start elsewhere before holding talks with Sporting Director Andoni Zubizarreta and new manager Luis Enrique this summer.

‘I was thinking about leaving last season but it’s normal to have ups and downs,' he said, 'I would have loved to play more but now I am confident and happy.

'I have been here a long time and I spoke to Andoni and Luis, who knows me well. The club have faith in me and it gives me confidence to stay here. I want to deliver here.

‘There are new signings every year at Barca and I have to deal with that. It is not only those three - Messi, Neymar and Suarez - but Gerard Deulofeu and Rafinha as well.

'The manager will decide who will play, it can be hard but I can handle it. I have always had tough competition here, with Samuel Eto’o, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Alexis Sanchez. I learned a lot from playing with them.'
