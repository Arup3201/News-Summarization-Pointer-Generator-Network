A First World War soldier's lost medal, which was thrown away in anger upon learning his two sons had died in action, has been returned to his family after 90 years.

Private Thomas William Copeman was presented with the 1914-15 Star after joining the Army Veterinary Corps, but discarded the honour when he came home to find that both his sons had been killed during combat on the Western Front.

It was finally discovered under six-inches of mud in a field in Bergh Apton, near Norwich, by metal detector enthusiast Paul Nunn.

And thanks to an internet appeal, the family has been reunited with the piece of history.

The medal is now in the hands of his three grandchildren, David Forder, 81, Mary Brookes, 80, and 79 year old Ann Daynes, who all still live in the county.

The siblings saw Mr Nunn's appeal in the local newspaper, but had no clue the honour belonged to their grandfather, who died in 1924, until they were sent a letter explaining the discovery.

Mr Forder says: 'I saw a bit in the paper about the medal but it didn't register.

'I didn't think any more about it until I got a letter through the post from the couple who found it. It was a bit of a surprise but I thought about it and called them back the next day.

'When I rang them up my sister had already arranged a meeting.'

The item was especially poignant for Mr Forder, who had never even seen a photograph of his mother Hilda's father.

He adds: 'I wasn't even born when my grandfather died in 1924 and I have never even seen a photo of him.

'I can't remember my mother saying much about him but now I have been able to build up a picture of him. It has just come out of the blue and as the days go on it goes deeper and deeper.'

Mr Forder is now determined that the medal will be handed down through the generations: 'Whoever finishes up with it will pass it down the line to their children and grandchildren so we make sure that now it stays in the family.'

Mr Nunn and his wife, Kirsty, spread word of their find on Facebook and Twitter, where it was picked up by the Brother's Wish Genealogy Service, which sought out the names and addresses of Private Copemanâ€™s grandchildren.

He now believes that there could be more medals belonging to the war veteran lying undiscovered in the same field.

He said: 'It was great to reunite Pte Copeman's family with his medal. Things moved unbelievably quickly from the original post going on Twitter to us meeting them.

'They said they don't know what happened to the other two medals that are usually awarded with the star so they could still be in the field. I will keep looking for them.'

The 1914-15 Star was awarded to members 
of the British and Imperial forces who fought between August 1914 and 
December 1915. The honour came with two others: the British War Medal and
the Victory Medal.

Private Copeman joined the Army Veterinary Corps in 1915, six months after the First World War broke out, and cared for thousands of army horses and service animals.

He was discharged on medical grounds in 
1917, but was left devastated upon his homecoming to hear his only two 
sons, Albert and Robert, had died within three months of each other in 
1916. He returned to his job as a farmer until his death aged 56.
