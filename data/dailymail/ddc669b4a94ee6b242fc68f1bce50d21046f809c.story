Chelsea fans are finally getting to know a little bit about summer signing Filipe Luis after the Brazilian took part in a Q&A session at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night.

The Brazil international was joined on stage by club legend Didier Drogba and veteran goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer as fans quizzed the trio.

The 29-year-old, who was signed from La Liga champions Atletico Madrid in the summer for a fee in the region of £16million, has been on the periphery of Chelsea's unbeaten start to the Premier League campaign.

Luis has only started two league games for Mourinho's side since his big-money move from the Spanish capital but supporters were given a glimpse of his personality during the Q&A.

The left back - speaking good English - revealed his penchant for films and admitted to owning 2,000 movies at his home, even claiming watching films was how he learned to speak English.

Luis also let fans in on his less than impressive culinary skills, admitting that he can't cook and then showed off his mischievous side by photobombing Didier Drogba's as the Ivorian tried to capture the Stamford Bridge pitch.

Drogba took to Instagram to share the picture and posted the caption: 'Taking pic of the house and guess who photobombed iiit?!? @filipeluis.'
