As any seasoned prankster will know, drive-thru takeaway cashiers make easy targets... you might even say giving them a fright is pure Child's Play.

And now one veteran online mischief-maker has put this theory quite literally to the test, with this hilarious Chucky doll drive-thru prank.

Magic of Rahat put the possessed child's toy in the 
front seat of his car as he drove into a series of fast-food pick-up 
points in a bid to hoodwink employees into thinking that the infamous movie villain 
was behind the wheel.

Child's Play: 'Magic of Rahat' put the possessed child's toy in the front seat of his car as he drove into a series of fast-food pick-up points in a bid to hoodwink employees into thinking that the infamous movie villain was behind the wheel

Scary sight: This is how the car looked to Magic of Rafat's victims

Fear: Using a hidden camera in the passenger seat, he filmed the reactions of his unsuspecting victims

And their reactions were quite something to behold, ranging from fear to laughter to downright disbelief.

The practical joker camouflaged himself behind a fake, home-made car seat which allowed him to drive without being seen.

Using a hidden camera in the passenger seat, he filmed the reactions of his unsuspecting victims.

One female employee slams the service window shut as soon as she sees the scar-faced apparition, from Hollywood film franchise Child's Play, and runs to her manager, whimpering: 'I don't like Chucky.'

Funny: Another runs to get her colleagues who point and laugh while taking pictures on a mobile phone

Attack: Perhaps the most unusual reaction, however, comes from one group of workers who resort to throwing a bag of chips at the doll in a bid to scare him off with saturated fats

It is not the first time Magic of Rahat has used his 'invisible driver' car seat to scare unsuspecting passers by.

In January a video of him fooling fast food workers into believing his car could drive itself went viral and has now had more than 30 million hits.

His other tomfoolery includes a ghost cereal box prank in a supermarket, a floating dollar bill prank and a breaking wind in a lift prank.
