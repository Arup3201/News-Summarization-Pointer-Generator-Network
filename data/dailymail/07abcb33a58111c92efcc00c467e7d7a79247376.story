She went to rehab last year, but only stayed for one week before checking herself out.

But friends of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Kim Richards are hoping this time she stays, as her problems are said to be far more 'serious'.

Those close to the 37-year-old told People magazine that the mother-of-four has a plethora of problems and desperately needs help.

'This time it's serious': Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Kim Richards's second rehab visit is to treat 'severe issues'

'Kim has been to rehab more than once before,' a source told the American magazine.

'But every time is a new time, and everyone just hopes this sticks and that she gets the help she needs. It's serious.'

Her recent erratic behaviour is said to have caused grave concern for those around her.

'Everyone was really worried about her,' added the source.

And it wasn't just those close to her that urged Kim to check into the facility.

Executives
 at Bravo also told Kim that she needed help, following the recent 
suicide of Taylor Armstrong's husband Russell, according to 
RadarOnline.com.

Relieved: Kim's family, including sister Kyle, are said to be deeply relieved that she is now getting the help that she needs

'After Russell Armstrong’s suicide Bravo is trying to making sure that nothing bad happens to the people on their shows,' a source told the website. 'They don’t want any more tragedies on their hands.'

'Kim was told by the people at Bravo that she had to get help and that help meant going into rehab immediately,' the insider said.

'The network people were worried about her and wanted her to try and fix her problems.'

Bosses at Bravo reportedly told Kim that her role on the show would be at risk if she didn't get help that she needed.

'The
 pressures the women face being on the show are enormous. Kim was 
basically told that if she wanted to stay on the show then she had to 
get help, so she did' the source told RadarOnline.com.

Out of the picture: Kim is reportedly homeless, after her plans to move in with boyfriend Ken Blumenfeld fell through

'Kim doesn’t have any other significant source of income and she needs to keep her job on the show.'

Kim is also said to be homeless, with her plans to move in with her boyfriend Ken apparently falling through.

During a recent episode of the Bravo show, Kim shocked her sister Kyle when she told her that she was planning to move in with Ken.

But now it seems that she is back on her own.

'He's not in the picture. No one really knows what the deal was with them, but Kim doesn't live with Ken,' a source told People.

'She's basically homeless, staying 
with various friends. She doesn't have a home base. It's not unusual for
 people to not hear from her for long stretches of time. It's been that 
way for years.'

Back to rehab: It was reported yesterday that Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Kim had checked into rehab

Kim's family are said to be deeply relieved that she is now getting the help that she needs.

'Her family is relieved she's getting help,' the insider added. 'She has lots of issues. She needs help.'

Reports that Kim had checked into rehab for a second time, emerged yesterday.

Entertainment Tonight reported that Kim had entered an ‘undisclosed treatment facility’.

A spokesperson for the reality star was unavailable for comment.

Kim has faced accusations that she is an alcoholic from her sister Kyle on the reality show last season and she was accused of taking crystal meth by new recruit Brandi Glandville this series, the video of which is below.

The former Disney star’s behaviour has certainly been erratic on the show and viewers have seen her slurring her words on a number of occasions.

Yet in one episode aired last month Dr Paul Nassif told Kim her problematic speech was down to the combination of prescription drugs she was taking.

Her co-star and sister Kyle made no comment of the news on her Twitter account yesterday but was posting messages about other things earlier in the day.

While viewers of the reality show have seen Kim's co-stars worry about her health, her sister has also shown concern over Ken.

Kyle made her feelings about Ken Blumenfeld, who was arrested in 2009 for driving under the influence, quite clear and burst into tears on the show.

She said she didn't think the 46-year-old businessman, who has been seeing Kim for a year, was 'right' for her sister.
