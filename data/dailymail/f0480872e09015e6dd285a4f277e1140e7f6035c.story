Gus Poyet believes Sunderland’s escape from relegation, during which they beat Manchester United at Old Trafford, is proof that anything is possible in the Premier League — and he’ll be reminding his players of it on Sunday afternoon.

The Black Cats will again be underdogs when they take on Louis van Gaal’s United at the Stadium of Light. 

But Poyet only has to look to the back end of last season — when his side won four of their final five games to beat the drop — for why another upset could be on the cards.

Escape: Gus Poyet says Sunderland's win at Manchester United last season helped prove anything is possible

Remember: Poyet says he will be reminding his players of that historic win at the Stadium of Light on Sunday

Moment: The Black Cats will again be underdogs when they take on Louis van Gaal’s United on Sunday

Sunderland survived relegation  Premier League relegation last year after winning four of their last five games, but what matches were they?

WON: Chelsea 1-2 Sunderland (April 19)

WON: Sunderland 4-0 Cardiff City (April 27)

WON: Man United 0-1 Sunderland (May 3)

WON: Sunderland 2-0 West Brom (May 7)

LOST: Sunderland 1-3 Swansea City (May 11)

‘I thought it (escaping relegation) was practically impossible. Ask anyone who knows me and they thought it was 100 per cent not possible,’ he said.

‘But there is no such thing in football. It’s only 99 per cent. There is always the possibility of a miracle or something unique because of the way we play in England, and that makes it really special. It’s the scenario where everyone can beat anyone else.

‘When Van Gaal was at Barcelona, it was very, very difficult for a bottom team to go to the Nou Camp and beat Barcelona. It happened once every 10 years.

‘But we talk about those unique games every season in England, where there is a shock result.

‘That makes this league so special and attractive to everyone around the world.’

Van Gaal is under pressure to improve on David Moyes’s campaign, and Poyet thinks his opposite number can.

‘They have to finish higher, no doubt,’ he said. ‘I cannot see Man United going another year without being in the Champions League. That would be really bad for them. But they need to start picking up points very soon and that is bad for us.’

And Poyet is hoping for a far more settled campaign in the North East this season.

‘I know what we did last year was incredible. It was unique,’ he said. ‘Now I want a season that is a bit calmer, not crazy like last season.’

Confident: Poyet says he knows 'what we did last year was incredible' but he wants a 'calmer' season this
