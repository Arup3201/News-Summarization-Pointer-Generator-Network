Codylily Parkin was rushed to Rotherham Hospital after she was misdiagnosed at a NHS walk-in centre

A four-year-old girl was left fighting for her life hours after medics at an NHS walk-in centre sent her home claiming she was suffering from a minor infection.

In fact Codylily Parkin was suffering from a diabetic attack and had to be placed in a medically induced coma in an intensive care unit after her brain swelled dangerously.

Her shocked parents say her life was saved by a quick-thinking emergency paramedic and hospital doctors at Rotherham General Hospital and Sheffield Children’s Hospital.

The walk-in centre who have been criticised by two coroners over recent incidents.

Mrs
Parkin said: 'We could have lost our daughter that day due to the utter
incompetence of the staff at that walk-in centre.We’re so lucky not to 
be in that situation.

'Codylily
had displayed a classic array of symptoms that should have been spotted
but they weren’t and that could have proved a fatal mistake.

'Two
nurses have been suspended and I’m told that they won’t return to work 
until they have received extra training, but that’s not really enough in
my eyes.'

Just a few hours before her collapse 
Codylily was taken by her dad parents to an NHS Wallk-in Centre in 
Rotherham town centre suffering from breathing difficulties, an 
insatiable thirst and whitening of her tongue. Four days earlier her GP 
had diagnosed vaginal thrush.

Medics at the walk-in centre then diagnosed Codylily with oral thrush and she was sent back to the family home in Rotherham.

Later the same day on September 15th, the little girl began suffering from confusion and vomiting and an emergency paramedic was called.

As soon as the paramedic arrived he said Codylily was slipping into a diabetic coma and she was rushed to hospital suffering from severe diabetic ketoacidosis. She was placed in an induced coma before being transferred to Sheffield Children’s Hospital ten miles away.

She returned to Rotherham Hospital two days later and was allowed home on September 20th. Codylily now faces a lifetime of insulin dependence because of the diabetes.

Mrs Parkin paid: 'The paramedic said straight away ‘She’s slipping into a diabetic coma’. We need to get her to hospital. We weren’t even aware she was diabetic but we were distraught.

'I’ve been told to take it further because there have been a number of inquests carried out as a result of people being sent home with and incorrect diagnosis, and I intend to.We’re so lucky not to be in that situation.

'Throughout her treatment doctors were talking about our treatment at the Walk-in Centre.'

Care UK, who operate the centre have 
apologised.In a statement Sheila Roberts, from the company , said: 'We 
have apologised to Codylily’s family for the distress caused to them and
acknowledged that care in this particular case fell below the normal 
high standards expected at the walk-in centre.

'We have conducted a full review of the circumstances surrounding Codylily’s attendance at the Rotherham walk-in centre.

'This review was triggered by the notification of Codylily’s admission to hospital and both nurses involved were immediately suspended from duty, which is normal practice for us when a clinical investigation takes place.

'The investigation included an internal audit of both nurses’ clinical performance, reviewing the consultation and written statements from the nurses involved.

'The review was underway before Mrs Parkin contacted the walk-in centre and we felt it important that the investigation was completed before replying, so that we could inform Codylily’s parents of the findings and outcomes.

'A letter has been sent to the family and steps have been taken to minimise the risk of a recurrence, including further training for both nurses.'

In May Rotherham Coroner Nicola Mundy said the centre missed an opportunity to save the life of 12 month old Lewis Mullins, from Maltby, Rotherham, who was suffering from chicken pox and breathing difficulties. He was sent home and died from complications.

In June staff at the centre were criticised by Sheffield coroner Chris Dorries over the death of superfit kick boxer Mark Mason,36, from St Helens. He had been unable to eat or drink for a week, had diarrhoea, could not walk unaided and went in unable to breathe. He was not referred to hospital and was found dead the next day from swine flu.

After both cases the centre claimed it was improving training and communications.
