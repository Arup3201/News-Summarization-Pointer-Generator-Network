Jenson Button claims he has been placed in an 'uncomfortable situation' by McLaren chief Ron Dennis' dithering.

Button should have known by now whether he had a future with the team beyond this season as Dennis promised over two months ago to deliver an answer on his driver line-up ahead of this weekend's year-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Button and team-mate Kevin Magnussen, however, were informed this week they would be kept in limbo until December 1 at the earliest as to who will partner Fernando Alonso in 2015.

The Briton could be competing in his final race with Fernando Alonso set to replace him next season 

Via a statement, seemingly in Dennis' words, the team claimed 'the optimal driver line-up is clearly an important process, and it is therefore one that requires precise and prolonged analysis'.

Just how long it requires Dennis to decide between the experience of a world champion and a driver at the end of his first year, but who he rates very highly, has been a hot topic on social media.

Certainly there was the feeling Button, in particular, given his longevity and standing in the sport, has been treated shabbily.

There is also a train of thought that as Button apparently has other options, Dennis is delaying matters to force him into opting for the exit door, so leaving the Group CEO with an easy choice.

Alonso shares a joke with Button in Thursday's press conference after the Spaniard was asked who he wanted to team up with at McLaren next year.

Assessing the latest twist in the saga over his future, Button said: 'It's been an interesting few months.

'When you're in Formula One for so many years - 15 years - you have blinkers on in terms of anything else apart from Formula One.

'This is the best sport in the world, this is your life, this is everything. But when you are put in an uncomfortable situation your eyes are opened to other possibilities.

'There are a lot of challenges out there, whether it's in motorsport, another sport or something else altogether.

'I'm open to many things in life, and for me I love what I do for a living, I love racing in Formula One.

'The time I have spent with McLaren, OK the last two years have been a bit tricky because of the results, but in terms of the personnel, they're mega.

'We had a barbecue on Wednesday night, and there is such a good atmosphere in this team. It is like a big family, and I have loved working with them.

'But will I wait for the decision? That's something I can't comment on right now.'

Ahead of the race at the Yas Marina circuit, Button is hoping the outcome will play no part in Dennis' thinking.

'Personally, I would hope not,' added Button.

'I would hope a result would not change my fate for the future. I feel I bring a lot more to the team than just one race. I would hope my career would speak a lot louder than one individual race.'
