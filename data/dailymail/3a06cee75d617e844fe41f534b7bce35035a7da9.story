The parents of a four-year-old who was successfully treated with proton beam therapy have spoken of their disgust at the way the parents of Ashya King have been treated.

Lilly Gillon was diagnosed with a rare type of brain tumour when she was just 15-months-old, but was given NHS funding for the £50,000 treatment.

The Birmingham toddler was flown to the U.S. state of Oklahoma in May 2011 to receive the treatment and will today start primary school thanks to the therapy.

Yesterday parents Graham and Cherie told of their horror at how Brett and Naghemeh King had been treated in their fight to save their sons life.

Mrs Gillon, who is a stay at home mother, 27, believes there should be more NHS funding for the proton beam therapy treatment.

She said: 'I feel for the King family because they're just parents that want their child to live for the longest he can and I'd do the same in their shoes.

'They're trying to do what's best for their child. That's their little boy and any parent would do the same.

'I agree that the doctors know best but if someone is saying, "yes there is a treatment there but you're not having it", that's unfair.'

Mrs Gillon first noticed that Lilly was ill in October 2010 when she stopped eating, walking and talking, and began vomiting.

In February 2011, she was diagnosed with ependymoma, a rare form of brain tumor that affects one in 68million.

Doctors advised that proton beam therapy was the best course of treatment and her parents were successful when they applied for NHS funding.

Three months later, Lilly, was sent from Birmingham Children's Hospital to a treatment centre in Oklahoma, America, for the proton beam therapy

The toddler, from Kingstanding, Birmingham, received a 33-session treatment across eight weeks and the tumour was successfully removed.

Although the couple were relieved that Lilly's funding was approved, they have found it difficult to accept that other children were rejected.

Mrs Gillon said: 'Lil went up to the hospital board against another little girl and Lilly got the yes and the little girl got a no, and when we got back from having the treatment, the little girl had died. That was so incredibly sad.'

Mr Gillon, 36, agreed: 'For anyone to be told they can't have that treatment, that's devastating, especially after knowing how well it has worked for Lil.

'As far as taking the child out of hospital, for me that's a massive act of desperation.

'We had moments where we didn't agree with the doctors and what they were doing but we sat there and debated it with them and luckily they took what we said on board.'

Proton Beam therapy is a type of radiation therapy which uses beams of protons directed precisely at a tumour.

The beams are more focused and less likely to damage healthy tissues around tumours when they destroy cancer cells.

Unfortunately, Lilly's type of cancer is classed as terminal and the tumour will eventually start to grow again.

But her parents say the therapy has given her a better quality of life.

Mr Gillon added: 'Before the therapy she would be in bed all day. She wasn't able to speak or walk but now she is bubbly and loves to play with her sisters.

'There was none of the sickness you get with conventional radiotherapy.

'There is no knowing how long we have her for but people with ependymoma have been known to live until 40.

'Lilly has scans every three months to check that the tumor is stable but try not to think about the future too much and just take each day as it comes.

'Ever since the treatment she's been healthy.'

Consultant paediatric oncologist, Bruce Morland, from Birmingham Children's Hospital, insisted a child's referral for proton treatment was treated on a case-by-case basis.

He said: 'The selection process for proton treatment is based individual cases and the type of tumour.

Graham and Cherie were relieved Lilly's funding was accepted but found it hard to see others rejected by NHS

'There is a national panel review for all the referrals in the UK. A hospital team can refer patients when they feel will meet the panels criteria for treatment.

'In Lily's case, ependymoma is a condition which the panel would be open to treating. However that referral would be based on strict criteria the patient has to meet.

'This includes the patient being well enough to travel, no evidence that the disease is spreading and how big and where the tumour is located on the brain.

'Generally speaking if all these criteria are met then it would be a case for referral.

'Protons work like radiotherapy but are used to target a more focused area, in the case of some tumours the whole brain needs treating which would mean proton treatment is no more affective than radiotherapy.

'In the case of Asha King, which is different, his condition may not fall under the criteria.'
