A mother and daughter have made their wedding days extra special - by having a joint ceremony.

Kim Milhano, 28, and Susan Scott-Williams, 51, got married together after their partners suggested the best friends share their special day.

The pair, who are often mistaken for sisters, saved £2,000 by combining their nuptials at a hotel near their homes in Bristol.

And after walking down the aisle together, signing the registers next to each other and cutting the same cake, the mother-daughter duo even shared their first dance.

Mother-of-two Kim said: 'Sharing my big day with another bride could made it feel half as special but it actually brought us double the joy.

'Me and my mum are best mates and so the whole day was perfect.'

Cheers to us! The best friends and family members said that sharing their big day with another bride could made it feel half as special but it actually brought them double the joy

Taking it in turns: Kim and her husband Carlos, who had been engaged for eight years but never got round to tying the knot, shared a kiss as her mother watched on

Kim, a care assistant, and her husband Carlos, 45, a construction worker, had been engaged for eight years but never got round to tying the knot.

It was only when her mother found love for the second time that her new partner Barry, 46, a painter and decorator, and Carlos conspired to convince the girls of their idea for a double wedding.

Kim and Susan then spent months planning their big day together choosing different dresses but matching bridesmaid gowns, bouquets and music.

The duo’s flower girls and paige boys also matched with Kim’s two children Koen, six, and Skye, four, doing the honours and Susan accompanied by her other grandchildren, Summer, five, and Harry, three.

After walking up two aisles in a V-shape, the brides met their husbands for their ceremonies, which were followed by a huge party for 180 people, including the families of brides and grooms.

And because they had one giant wedding instead of two, the family managed to save a quarter of the cost of the £8,000 event.

Kim said: 'When Carlos rang me and said "I think you need to sit down" I was worried one of the kids was hurt.

'So it was a bit of a relief when he said he wanted to have a double wedding with my mum and Barry.

'Up until then day-to-day life had taken over and we’d never had time or the money to plan a wedding.

'Mum and Barry were happy for us to do things completely our way because they’ve both been married before but it was her wedding too and I didn’t want to take over.

'So we planned everything together - it’s what our whole family is like. Thankfully we never had a difference of opinion!”

Big moment: Kim and Carlos loved sharing their special day with her mother

Susan, a drugs and alcohol worker, said: 'I’d never thought about doing anything like this even though Barry and I had already thought about possibly getting married.

'Although Kim was more hesitant than me when Carlos and Barry suggested it, we all soon realised it would be a fantastic idea.

'We did lots of planning together and although we’re quite different it all worked out. And we definitely saved money by having just one wedding instead of two!

'It was such a proud day for my dad seeing his daughter and his granddaughter get married in the same wedding.'
