Northern Territory Labour Party leader Matthew Gardiner has  left Australia to reportedly join the fight against the Islamic State militants in the Middle East.

The Australian Federal Police has confirmed it is investigating the case after the former NT union official and senior NT Labor party figure, left the country.

It is understood the 43-year-old, who recently resigned as NT United Voice union secretary, was heading for Iraq or Syria where he plans to join Kurdish militants.

Gardiner, who has an army background, was allowed to leave the country because he was not on any watch list, ABC reports.

The AFP would only confirm Gardiner was the subject of an active investigation.

'The AFP is aware of this matter,' an AFP spokesperson said on Sunday.

'As this matter is part of an ongoing investigation it is not appropriate to comment further.'

A union spokesperson would only confirm Mr Gardiner had recently resigned, and said any further questions should be put the AFP.

Mr Gardiner is also head of the NT Labor Party, though his status in this role remains unclear.

A federal Labor spokesman said opposition leader Bill Shorten was aware of reports regarding Mr Gardiner, but no statement would be made until they were confirmed.

Mr Gardiner, 43, reportedly served as an Australian Army combat engineer in Somalia in the early 1990s.

Attorney General George Brandis has received an AFP brief on the Gardiner case.

A spokesperson for Mr Brandis said Australians who join militant causes overseas face imprisonment should they survive and return.

'If you fight illegally in overseas conflicts, you face up to life in prison upon your return to Australia,' the spokesperson said.

'It is illegal to fight in Syria for either side of the conflict.

'It is illegal to fight for a terrorist organisation anywhere, including in Iraq.'

Australians who wanted to oppose the actions of the Islamic State group should instead donate to humanitarian groups operating in affected areas, the spokesperson said.

Around 90 Australians are understood to have travelled to the Middle East to join militant causes.
