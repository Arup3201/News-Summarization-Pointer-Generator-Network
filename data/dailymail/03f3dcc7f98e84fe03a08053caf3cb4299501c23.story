The world's first national motorway network of electric car-charging points opens across Britain today.

Free to use, the solar-powered 'top-up' stations are already at 12 Welcome Break services - with 17 more due to open by the end of September.

The move means electric vehicles will for the first time be able to travel anywhere in Britain.

World first: Transport Minister Mike Penning uses a solar-powered 'top-up' point at South Mimms service station in Hertfordshire. The points are already at 12 Welcome Break services in Britain - with 17 more due to open by the end of September

Previously, the main barrier for people wanting to buy electric cars was range anxiety, the restriction of only being able to 
drive within their own city.

Dale Vince, the founder of Ecotricity, the firm behind the network,
said: 'Until now, charging posts have all been in city centres like 
London, but this is where you need them the least.

'Statistics show that 
it’s not in towns and cities where electric cars need to recharge, but 
on longer journeys between cities - and that means motorways.'

Each charging post will be powered 
with 100 per cent green energy made at Ecotricity’s wind and solar parks across Britain.

The posts will be located outside the 
main entrance, with two sockets that can be accessed by registering for a
free swipecard.

Electric car owners need to register for a swipecard with Ecotricity in order to use the service

Electric cars can top-up in just 20 
minutes using rapid recharge points with a 32A supply or fully charge in two 
hours. Those using the slower 13A supply will be able to 
recharge fully if staying overnight at motorway service hotels.

Within 18 months all Welcome Break motorway services
will have charging points.

Electric car drivers, and motorcycle riders, will then
be able to drive from across Britain completely free and
with vastly reduced emissions.

Mr Vince added: 'We’re creating the infrastructure to 
get Britain’s electric car revolution moving. This marks the beginning 
of the end for the old combustion engine.

'With world oil prices going 
through the roof, you’ll now be able to get around Britain using only 
the power of the wind. It costs 1p a mile in an electric vehicle, 
compared with 10p in a petrol car.'
