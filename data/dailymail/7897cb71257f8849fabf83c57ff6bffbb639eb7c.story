It isn't quite the 44 damned days of Brian Clough's Leeds United reign 40 years ago, but it appears David Hockaday's time at Elland Road will not last a great deal longer.

Just 65 days into Massimo Cellino's experiment with an unknown manager plucked from non-League, he has apparently already been given the Caesarean thumbs down.

The unforgiving Italian owner, who famously got through 36 managers in 22 years at Cagliari, will pull the trigger once again unless there is an instant upturn in fortunes, starting with Wednesday's Capital One Cup derby with Bradford.

Staying power: Dave Hockaday will not be sacked as Leeds manager despite recent poor results

Hockaday, hired from Conference side Forest Green Rovers in June, was understandably exasperated after his side finished with nine men in the defeat at Watford.

But as he spoke of the 'green shoots and signs of recovery' Leeds are apparently showing, he did not come across as a man expecting to lose his job. 'I strongly believe that with the players I've got, I'm doing a decent job,' he said.

'Barring that moment of madness, we would have come away with something.'

That moment came on 58 minutes when debutant defender Giuseppe Bellusci miskicked a clearance, allowing the livewire Fernando Forestieri through on goal. Bellusci dragged him down, was sent off and Troy Deeney scored from the spot to make it 2-1.

He has apologised to the team — for what it's worth,' Hockaday said. 'It's something I can't legislate for.'

Until then, Leeds had been just about a match for Beppe Sannino's in-form side. Afterwards, they lost the plot, conceding twice more — to Forestieri and Daniel Tozser — and saw Sam Byram sent off in stoppage time for stupidly lashing out at Daniel Pudil.

Hockaday added: 'Even though it was 4-1 today, I don't really think anyone can go away and say they were that much better than you and they ripped the pants off you.' 

Yet Cellino deals solely in cold, hard facts and Hockaday has presided over three defeats from four, leaving Leeds a solitary point above the Championship drop zone. 

U-turn: Leeds owner Massimo Cellino had decided to sack the manager before changing his mind

The Italian was not amused and another defeat is likely to see time called on his experiment and Hockaday's contract ripped up.

With hindsight, the writing has always been on the wall. The 2,000-strong travelling contingent at Vicarage Road reflected long-held frustrations when they sang 'We're s*** and we're sick of it' during the second half.

It's been a long decade in the wilderness since Leeds dropped out of the Premier League and Hockaday was hardly the high-profile, proven appointment the fans expected when Brian McDermott left last season.

Cellino admitted that Hockaday was working with an incomplete squad last week but some of those brought in don't look up to it. Bellusci endured a nightmare start and new striker Mirco Antenucci was badly off the pace. 

Slump: Leeds are perilously close to the relegation zone after losing three of their four opening games

When another, Billy Sharp, was subbed at 2-1 to avoid picking up an injury, the away fans jeered Hockaday.

And this dismal performance was against a Watford side supposedly in a crisis of their own. When Lloyd Dyer scored at Rotherham in midweek, he celebrated by shouting abuse at Sannino, leading to rumours of a camp unhappy at the Italian's constant rotation.

But he'll be sticking by his methods after this performance, which saw the Hornets soar to second in the table.

Dyer was nowhere near the squad against Leeds but will return. Sannino said: 'I did not see that celebration. This belongs to the past. I need all of my players.'

If only Hockaday could rewind history too. His troubles are very much in the present. 

PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND

Stuart Pearce has restored passion and purpose at Nottingham Forest and they're flying high in the Championship after a 4-0 thumping of Reading. 

Winger Michail Antonio scored twice and set up another against his former employers, while £5m signing Britt Assombalonga now has four in four League games.

'The new signings have really hit the ground running,' said a delighted Pearce.

 ELSEWHERE...

Felix Magath could get the sack if Fulham lose to Brentford in the Capital One Cup tomorrow. They are rock bottom after a 5-1 loss at Derby. 'The result was very bad and so now is the time to change,' he said afterwards. We presume he meant team selection, not his job.

Jose Baxter scored maybe the goal of the weekend for Sheffield United against Crawley, picking out the top corner with a 25-yard cracker at Bramall Lane.

Morecambe's perfect start continued with a 2-1 win at Cambridge in League Two. Teenage striker Paul Mullin grabbed both goals in another impressive display.
