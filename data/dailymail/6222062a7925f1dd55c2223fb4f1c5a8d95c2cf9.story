The Pennsylvania Turnpike  between Bensalem and Willow Grove is expected to remain closed into the late afternoon after a series of crashes involving up to 100 cars this morning.

The crashes were reported just after 8am Friday, after the area got about a foot of snow overnight leaving the roads slippery.

The pileups, involving cars and trucks, stretch for nine miles and left 30 people injured.

Turnpike spokesman Bill Capone says at least 30 commuters have been hospitalized for injuries sustained in the accidents.

According to Abington Memorial Hospital, five people were seriously hurt.

Aerial views show a remarkable scene of tractor trailers jackknifed across the road and cars wedged in the snow where they veered off to the side and up the embankment to try and avoid an accident.

The first accident caused a chain reaction of pile-ups along the turnpike, one accident after another as drivers were unable to avoid crashing in the icy conditions.

According to NBC, the first crash, involving 10 cars and tractor-trailers, happened at 8:25am.

A series of further crashes behind those vehicles happened within moments. 

Clusters of crashes are interspersed with vehicles brought to a standstill by the accidents.

Drivers and vehicles are lining the side of the road as authorities attempt to take control of the situation.

According to NBC, authorities suspect the crashes were caused by multiple factors.

A
 snow-related speed limit was removed at 6am this morning, and drivers 
were likely driving too fast and too close to each other for the icy 
conditions.

In addition, eastbound drivers were driving into the sun, and the glare may have made it difficult to see.The decision to lift the speed restrictions was based on road conditions at the time, he said.

'Based on reports from the road crews, the roads were such that we could restore it back to normal posted speeds,' Capone said. 'If somebody had said there was still a reason to keep it in place, we would've kept it in place.'

Several motorists interviewed by The Associated Press described an icy, slippery highway.

'I expected this road to be clear,' said Dan Santillo, 65, of Jeffersonville, who was stuck about a mile back. 'A major thoroughfare like this? It actually has pieces of ice that were never removed or salted. It just didn't make sense.'

Santillo said he was driving 40 to 45 mph, but other motorists were flying by him at 65 or 70.

'I
 was thinking, what the hell are people doing? It's icy. They're crazy,'
 he said. 'People have this false sense of security. I was shocked. 
Don't they see the road, see what I'm seeing?'

David Hill, 27, said he wasn't surprised there was an accident.

'I
 got on the turnpike and it was nothing but ice,' he said. 'I was very 
surprised at the condition of it. Normally the turnpike is one of the 
first roads that's cleared, but today I was driving on solid ice.'

The snarled traffic meant that hundreds of commuters were unable to get to work Friday, but that didn't stop one dedicated teacher.

Her students may have thought they were getting out of class, but Lynn McNulty had other ideas.

McNulty, a teacher at the Hun School in Princeton, connected her iPhone to Facetime and had her students log in on their iPads.

She told CNN that she taught her planned class on the Crimean War, and that her students took the class seriously and they had a great discussion.

The Pennsylvania Turnpike Authority has instituted 'Plan X,' which involves rerouting traffic after multi-vehicle accidents, indicating that authorities expect the road to be blocked for some time.

 Volunteers from The American Red Cross of Southeastern Pennsylvania were headed to the scene to bring food, water and blankets to stranded motorists.
