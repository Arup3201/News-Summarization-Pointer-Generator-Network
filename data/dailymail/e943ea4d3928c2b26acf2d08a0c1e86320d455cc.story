Two men have been arrested for posing as top executives with a financial firm and scamming $220,000 worth of charter jet flights, limo rides, lavish hotel stays and Tiffany's jewelery.

Dante Dixon, 45, from Miami, Florida and Christopher Henderson, 32, of Akron, Ohio were both arrested on Monday in Ohio after authorities discovered their ruse. They face wire fraud charges.

The two men made at least four flights between May and June after contacting Jet Aviation, a business aviation provider based at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and claiming to be top execs.

Under the name 'Josh Stevens', they provided a fake email address they said was linked to the company - and were able to tap into a sham $350,000 line of credit issued by the company.

A man using that name called Jet Aviation's offices in Chicago, Illinois and Van Nuys, California in May to enquire about its private charter flight services, according to the criminal complaint released by the FBI.

In the draft charter agreement, which was signed after being sent to the fake email, Dixon was listed as a vice president 
and Henderson as a vice president of international affairs of the company.

Jet Aviation was never paid for $164,911 spent on the charter flights between California, Ohio, New Jersey and Miami or $10,879 for limousine services used between May and June this year.

The duo also allegedly used their fake corporate credentials at a Tiffany store in Bal Harbor, Florida to charge $19,991 in watches, sunglasses, sterling silver, leather business card holders and men's cologne.

'Scam': The men were caught after a aviation employee called the bank and learned they were not employees

They also allegedly stayed at the W hotel in South Beach, Miami, where they racked up bills of $25,466 for overnight stays.

But their scheme unraveled on June 7,
when a Jet Aviation employee met the men before a flight from Teterboro
to Miami and contacted the unnamed company, which told him that neither
man was employed by the firm.

'During the meeting, the defendants 
identified themselves as being employees at the financial institution,' 
the FBI statement said.

'The
Jet Aviation employee then contacted the financial institution and was 
informed that Dixon and Henderson and others were not, and had never 
been employees at the financial institution.'

The men were arrested in Akron, Ohio early on Monday morning - Dixon was picked up at his mother's house - and taken into custody following the FBI investigation.

Both men, who are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, made their initial court appearances in Ohio on Monday. They were ordered held until they can be extradited to New Jersey.

If convicted, Dixon and Henderson each face up to 20 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

Court records show that Dixon has a history of criminal fraud.

In July 2000, he was charged in a scheme to obtain hundreds of unauthorized credit cards by submitting applications using the identities of real individuals.

Prosecutors said the scheme led to $1.4 million in losses for several financial institutions and Dixon was sentenced to six years in prison.
