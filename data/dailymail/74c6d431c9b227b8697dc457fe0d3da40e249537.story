Tottenham insist they are not in discussions to sell the club for £1billion.

It was reported that billionaire owner Joe Lewis was prepared to entertain offers for the club in which his company, Enic International, bought a controlling stake in 2001.

But a Tottenham statement read: ‘Contrary to recent press speculation, neither the club, nor its majority shareholder, are in any takeover discussions and the focus of the club is fully on delivering the new stadium project.’

In the original plans, the Northumberland Development Project was due to be completed by August 2014

The reports come at a time when Tottenham are searching for a temporary home, having accepted that it is 'highly unlikely’ they will be able to move into their proposed new stadium in time for the 2017-18 season.

Wembley has apparently been ruled out because the stadium is limited by Brent Council to 37 events each year, owing to issues including noise, policing and parking. Arsene Wenger admitted it would make 'geographical sense' for Spurs and Arsenal to share the Emirates Stadium, though admitted it was unlikely.

MK Dons' stadium:mk looks the favourite to become Tottenham's temporary home 

MK Dons’ stadium:mk is understood to be a leading option and Mauricio Pochettino praised the 30,000-capacity ground on Thursday, having attended Dons’ shock Capital One Cup win over Manchester United last month.

He said: ‘Every single decision that the club makes is to improve the club and give better solutions or facilities to our supporters. So I always back these decisions.’

When asked specifically about stadium:mk, he added: ‘Yes, I was in Milton Keynes to watch the game against Manchester United. It was my first time in Milton Keynes. It's a very good stadium with very good facilities.’

Mauricio Pochettino could face a season where Tottenham have to play home games at a neutral ground

Tottenham face Sunderland this weekend, having been trounced 3-0 by Liverpool before the international break. 

Highlighting the need for time to establish his ideas within the squad, Pochettino, who will name his new long-term team captain on Monday, said: ‘We need to learn and improve. We need to build a strong, confident and solid team.

‘The result was 3-0 to Liverpool but when you analyse the game, I think we got a lot of situation to analyse and improve. This is a good game for us to learn how to compete with the big teams.

‘The fans see that we need to improve. In football you always need time and patience and you need results. We are going the right way.’ 

Tottenham will move from White Hart Lane in an effort to compete financially with the big European clubs

Daniel Levy could consider moves to Wembley, Portman Road, Falmer Stadium or Stadium MK

He added: ‘My ambition is always to reach the top. We need to believe. This is the process and we need to provide our players, supporters and environment with belief. This is our objective.

‘I am very happy with the squad. When I arrived here I knew that in the last season Tottenham spent a lot of money and made a big investment. 

'This season was always about believing in our players, adding some to give balance to the squad, and then get the best out of each player and shows that we are a very good squad.’
