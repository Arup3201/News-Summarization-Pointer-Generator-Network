Manchester City winger Jesus Navas felt the champions paid the price for failing to take their chances at Burnley.

City slumped to a surprise 1-0 defeat at Turf Moor on Saturday to leave their hopes of retaining their Barclays Premier League title in serious jeopardy.

George Boyd scored the only goal of the game with a crisp left-footed strike just after the hour, punishing City for their lack of incision.

City mustered only five shots on target in a lacklustre display but they did still create 21 opportunities and have a strong penalty appeal declined. Navas felt their luck was simply out.

The Spaniard said: 'We came here to get the three points. I think we were a bit unlucky to concede the goal and that we couldn't win.

'We tried to be really persistent in attack but they had a lot of people defending. We tried really hard but we couldn't score. They created a lot of danger but I believe we still had opportunities to get the game won.'

The result increased the pressure on manager Manuel Pellegrini, whose position has come under scrutiny during a faltering spell.

Since pulling level with Chelsea on New Year's Day, City have managed to win just three of nine league games.

Their hopes of rescuing their season - and taking the heat off Pellegrini - could now come down to the small matter of overturning a 2-1 deficit at Barcelona at the Nou Camp in the Champions League on Wednesday.

'It is time to think about the next game,' Navas said. 'We have to prepare very well and try to get to the next round.'
