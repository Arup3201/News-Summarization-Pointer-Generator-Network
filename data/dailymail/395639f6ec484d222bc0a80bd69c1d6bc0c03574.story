Ronald Balfour, the real-life Monuments Man who died trying to save artworks in WW2, has been written out of the new George Clooney film

The family of the real-life Monuments Man who helped to save priceless pieces of art from the Nazis are upset that he has been written out of history by a new Hollywood film.

Ronald Balfour was just one of two men from the monuments, fine arts and archives (MFAA) division to die while trying to protect art from being destroyed at the end of the Second World War.

Now George Clooney has been accused of writing the shy academic out of history after failing to even mention Balfour's name in his new blockbuster.

While Balfour was not married and had no children himself, his ten nieces and nephews are said to be 'saddened' that an opportunity to remember their uncle's bravery was missed.

Instead the Hollywood account sees Americans claim the glory for rescuing history's glittering prizes.

The
 film  - directed, co-written and starring George Clooney - follows a group of 
MFAA officers from after D-day until the end of the war and is based on a
 book by US writer Robert Edsel.

The MFAA involved around 345 men and women from 17 nations. It was led by the Americans, but Britain provided the second-largest group of volunteers.

Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville plays the only English role -  a fictional academic called Donald Jeffries.

He is part of the MFAA frontline team led by Clooney's character, George L Stout, and who is based on a real MFAA officer and well known American art collector.

Subject of a new film: George Clooney's movie 'The Monuments Men' follows the heroic exploits of the monuments, fine arts and archives division trying to save works of art at the end of WW2

Despite providing the second-largest consignment of volunteers for the unit, the only English character in the film - played by Hugh Bonneville - is entirely fictional

Reporting for duty: Bill Murray plays one of the experts employed in the team

Balfour was killed aged 41 in early in 1945, at Cleves, in 
north-western Germany while he was trying to  protect historic church 
artefacts with two German civilians. He was killed by a shell while 
trying to save a medieval 
altarpiece.

He
 had recently saved a 14th century archive and had managed to persuade 
Canadian troops not to blow up the medieval Steintor city 
gate at Goch.

Polly Hutchison, 65, one of Balfour's nieces, told The Times: 'He certainly was a very brave man, and could have been a very successful academic.

'He was old enough not to join up, but it was a subject close to his heart. He wasn't saving art for one side, he died saving it for mankind.

This hoard of art, found in a 12th century castle belonged to Heinrich Himmler, the Nazi propaganda minister

Towards the end of the conflict, soldiers began stumbling upon treasure troves of stolen art, including this one in a salt mine at Merkers, Germany, which is being inspected by American General Dwight D Eisenhower

Many of the works, hidden across Europe, are still missing. Last year £1bn worth of art was found in the apartment of German Cornelius Gurlitt

'He probably would have been very shy and modest about it, but as a family we are very proud of him.'

In Germany, he is celebrated and a local archive and a street has been named in his honour. His family accepted a bravery award the Johanna Sebus Medaille, on his behalf, in 1985.

But in his home country, little is known of him  although an archive room is named after him at King's College, Cambridge.

The only other man from the unit to be killed as American architect Walter Huchthausen who was shot near Aachen in April 1945.

It is not the first time that American film producers have rewritten history to the detriment of Britain.

In the 2000 film U-571, an American submarine intercepts a stricken German U-Boat and steals an Enigma code machine, helping decipher the German army's coded messages.

In fact it was a British ship, HMS Bulldog, that boarded the submarine, and their achievement was not capturing the machine (Bletchley Park already had three) but finding the code books.

The film is also set in spring 1942, almost a year after the Enigma code was actually deciphered, and seven months before the US even joined the war.

In another re-write, the beginning of 2001 movie Pearl Harbor features Ben Affleck's character almost single-handedly winning the Battle of Britain after Pearl Harbor attack.

In fact the Japanese assault on the Hawaii base happened after the Luftwaffe's attacks on Britain, and while a few American pilots were involved in the air defence, America as a country was not involved in the war at that point.

Serial offender Affleck also toyed with the truth in Oscar winning Argo, which he starred in and directed.

In the film six American diplomats are trying to escape from Iranian revolutionaries who occupy their embassy. According to Affleck the British refuse to offer them shelter.

In fact the British embassy did offer them refuge, risking being attacked themselves, but were unable to find the US staff in time.

He was old enough not to serve, but volunteered out of a passion for art
