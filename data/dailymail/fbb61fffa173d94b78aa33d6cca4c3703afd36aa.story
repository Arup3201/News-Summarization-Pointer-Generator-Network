Tragic accident: John Coughlin, pictured attending Sunday's Giants game at the Met Life stadium where his brother Tom is coach

The younger brother of New York Giants coach Tom Coughlin, the racehorse trainer John Coughlin, has died following a freak accident when he fell out of a taxi on his way back from watching a game.

John Coughlin suffered a brain hemorrhage after falling from the cab and hitting his head outside his home in Hackensack New Jersey on Monday night. He was 63.

He was rushed to Hackensack University Medical Center but died of his injuries. His brother is understood to have been by his side.

Earlier that day he had attended the 
Manning Bowl III game between the Giants and Denver at the Met Life 
Stadium, where he stood on the sidelines with his brother wearing a 
Giants jacket.

In a 
statement released by the team brother Tom said: 'Our family is thankful
for the expressions of sympathy and prayers for our brother John's 
passing.

'We all appreciate them. John was a friend to all. He loved life, and he will be greatly missed. He left us way too soon.'

John
Coughlin had been a successful racehorse trainer for many years and was
a familiar figure at the Meadowlands racetrack. He trained 154 winners 
raking in over $1.4 million in earnings.

A
New Jersey resident for over 20 years, he owned and operated Coughlin's
Stables at the Meadowlands located just across the parking lot from the
Giants stadium.

He was a 
former member of both the Standardbred Owners Association of New York 
and the Standardbred Breeders and Owners Association of New Jersey.

A
friend and fellow racehorse trainer Larry Remmen, who had joined Mr 
Coughlin at the game, told the New York Daily News: 'As a result of the 
fall, he had a brain hemorrhage.

'It was just a freak thing that happened.'

Besides
his brother, John Coughlin is survived by his companion, Suzanne 
Malloy, and five sisters, Carole Kingston of Canandaigua, N.Y., Kathleen
Troutman of Waterloo, N.Y., Patricia Reed of Waterloo, Luann Coughlin 
of Waterloo and Christine Cohn of East Long Meadow, Mass.
