A reality televison producer arrived in 
Mexico escorted by nearly a dozen agents after being extradited 
from the United States to face trial over his wife's killing.

Former Survivor producer Bruce 
Beresford-Redman landed at Cancun's airport late last night and was whisked away in an 
SUV accompanied by three police vehicles.

He was driven to the state prosecutors' office, which is charging him with the 
death of his wife, Monica, whose naked body was found in a sewer cistern at a 
Cancun resort following an April 2010 family vacation.

The noncommercial jet touched down at around 10.40pm on a separate runway where reporters didn't have access.

The victim's sister, Carla Burgos, said: 'It was a relief. We have been waiting for that for two years.'

Gaspar Armando Garcia Torres, attorney 
general for the state of Quintana Roo, said the suspect will be taken to
a jail in the Caribbean resort. He could see a judge anytime within the next three days.

Reporters couldn't approach Bruce 
Beresford-Redman. From afar, the producer could be seen handcuffed 
wearing a white T-shirt and a bulletproof vest.

Handouts issued later confirmed his outfit.

The legal saga of Beresford-Redman has played out on both sides of the border.

The U.S. Marshals Service turned the 
Emmy-nominated producer over to Mexican federal police Wednesday, 
roughly two weeks after State Department officials signed a warrant 
clearing his extradition.

The producer and his wife Monica 
Beresford-Redman had gone to the resort with their young children in an 
attempt to save their marriage after she learned her husband was 
cheating on her.

Mexican authorities say Beresford-Redman murdered his wife ‘by asphyxiating her’ in their room on April 5, 2010.

Her naked body was found in a hotel sewer three days later.

Bruce Beresford-Redman opted in December
not to appeal a U.S. court ruling upholding his extradition. Mexican 
authorities later said they had reached an agreement for his return.

'Bruce eagerly wants to set the record 
straight, confront the charges in a fair trial and return to his 
children,' spokesman Stephen Jaffe wrote in an email.

Beresford-Redman, an Emmy-nominated 
producer, has denied that he killed his wife and his attorneys have 
attacked evidence in the case.

His U.S. attorneys fought his return to 
Mexico, but two federal judges ruled there was ample reason to send him 
abroad for trial.

Beresford-Redman has also employed 
attorneys in Mexico to challenge the validity of the case there. He was 
arrested on a fugitive warrant in the Los Angeles area in November 2010.

Mexican and U.S. authorities say he left
Mexico without permission, although Beresford-Redman's lawyers have 
claimed he was under no obligation to stay and needed to return to the 
U.S. to help care for his children.

The family of Monica Beresford-Redman 
said the extradition 'marks a major milestone in our journey to ensure 
justice for Monica.'

'After nearly 15 months in United States
custody, Bruce will finally be returned to Mexico to stand trial for 
Monica's murder,' attorney Alison Triessl wrote in a statement released 
on behalf of the family.

Triessl said the family will follow the 
case in Mexico and will ask for the maximum sentence if Beresford-Redman
is convicted. The maximum sentence could be 12 to 30 years in prison.

'He has always stated that he is 
innocent of the charges against him and it is his hope that the court in
Cancun will assure that he receives a fair trial in which, he is 
confident, he will be exonerated,' Beresford-Redman's attorney, Richard 
Hirsch wrote in a statement.

U.S. prosecutors presented statements 
from hotel guests who said they heard loud arguing and cries of distress
coming from the couple's room on the night Monica Beresford-Redman went
missing.

The producer's attorneys have claimed 
the noises came from Beresford-Redman and his children playing loud 
games throughout the night and that there isn't any forensic evidence 
that he killed his wife.
