The most iconic piano in Hollywood history – the one played by Sam in the Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman classic Casablanca – is set to go under the hammer this month.

The famous upright – used in Rick’s Cafe in the 1942 film – is expected to fetch $1million – about £630,000 – as one of the highlights of a film memorabilia auction at Bonhams in New York.

The salmon-coloured instrument, one of two featured in the film, is the one on which the movie’s signature tune, As Time Goes By, is played by Sam (singer Dooley Wilson).

It is one of 30 items from the Second World War drama being put up for sale by a private collector.

The doors of Rick's Cafe America, a final draft of the screenplay, signed cast photos, and passports created for the characters in the film will all go up for auction. 

The sale will also have items from other films including a pinafore and a test dress originally designed for Judy Garland for her performance in the film 'The Wizard of Oz.' 

'Bonham’s is thrilled to represent this remarkable Casablanca collection, certainly one of the most significant film memorabilia collections still in private hands,' said the director of Entertainment Memorabilia at Bonham’s, Catherine Williamson, earlier this year.

Classic: Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca. The upright piano is one of 30 items from the Second World War drama being put up for sale by a private collector

A different 58-key upright piano from a flashback scene between Bergman and Bogart was auctioned at Sotheby's in 2012 and sold for $602,500, below the estimated $800,000-$1.2 million that Sotheby's predicted.

Casablanca took home three Oscars in 1943 for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Director.

In the scene that the piano is played, Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart, storms over angrily having instructed Sam, played by Wilson, to never play that song again and is stunned to see his ex-lover Ilsa, played by Ingrid Bergman, at the bar with her husband, a fugitive leader of the Czech resistance.
