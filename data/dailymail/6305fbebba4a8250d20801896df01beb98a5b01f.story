Pope Francis has spoken about how a nun saved his life while he was suffering from a lung condition aged 21

He is the spiritual healer for millions across the globe, but now Pope Francis has revealed that his life was saved by a nun when he was just 21.

While in hospital with a recurring lung problem, the pontiff says his doctor was not prescribing him enough antibiotics.

However his life was saved by a nun who instinctively tripled his dose, a feat the Pope puts down to her working on the front line and being with the sick every day.

The remarks were made in a new book, I Fioretti di Papa Francesco, (The Little Flowers of Pope Francis), in which Pope Francis talks to Andrea Tornielli, a veteran Vatican journalist.

The former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio's condition came to light during his Papal election in March this year, after his predecessor became the first Pope in 600 years to retire due to poor health.

Francis reportedly had three cysts on his lung, before having part of the organ removed, though Vatican officials have always said they have seen him in nothing other than good health.

Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Tornielli agreed. He said: 'His health is good and he shows great stamina. He works many hours a day and spends many hours a week greeting people in St 
  Peter’s Square in the freezing cold.'

Mr Tornielli also revealed how Pope Francis made a personal phone call to a woman whose son is addicted to drugs after she passed a note written on a napkin to one of his officials.

The incident happened at Bueno Aires airport, after which Francis called the woman and said he would pray for her and her son.

Proving that Francis has always been a man of the people, the book also recounts how he dined with the poor while he was archbishop of Buenos Aires.

After eating with the Pope, one man told the author: 'He looked me in the eyes and said to me: "I like to sit at the tables of the poor because they serve food and share with their hearts."'

In another chapter, Francis reveals how he took a strong stand when priest Father 'Pepe’ Jose Maria di Paolo received death threats over his work with drug addicts.

The former archbishop defended him, insisting that he would rather be killed than see any of his priests suffer.
