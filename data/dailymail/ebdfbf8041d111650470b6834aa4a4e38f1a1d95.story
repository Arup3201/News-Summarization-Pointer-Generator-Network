Forget the Maldives or even Ireland a la Kim Karadashian and Kanye West, two festival fanatics are celebrating life as newlyweds at Glastonbury.

Jack and Bianca Vaughan tied the knot in the local town of Glastonbury before arriving with the rest of the revellers at the iconic music festival in Somerset.

The couple from Reading gazed longingly into each others eyes and walked hand in hand through the sun-drenched fields last night.

Bianca was still wearing what looked like her lace wedding dress, which she teamed with white Hunter wellington boots.

Jack, however, had changed (we hope) into a grey T-shirt and shorts, which he wore with a pair of trainers.

The loved-up pair joined the rest of the crowds as the music festival gathered pace last night.

Come rain or shine, every year the most fashionable - and questionable - of festival goers descend upon Glastonbury for a weekend of well-dressed debauchery.

Lovers: Jack and Bianca, who was still wearing her dress, made their way through the crowds at the iconic music festival last night

How romantic: The loved-up duo walked off into the sunset on the first night of the hotly anticipated music festival

Not only is Glastonbury the world's most
iconic music festival, it is also a catwalk for celebrities and the 
bands' glamorous groupies to showcase their style credentials for all 
the world to see.

Glastonbury may have a 
reputation for mud and rain, but as one of the 
summer's first festivals, it's also a key indicator of what looks will 
pass muster at the rest of the summer's musical events and gatherings and which are better left in the soggy fields of Somerset.

Some
 looks never go out of fashion - like the perennially popular Hunter 
wellingtons, quilted Barbour jackets and floral crowns - and this year 
also saw an explosion of neon and 90s grunge as ravers made some serious 
sartorial effort. FEMAIL has rounded up the good, the bad and the downright bonkers styles on day one of Glastonbury. You're welcome.  

Here comes the bride! No one batted an eyelid as the newlyweds made their way through the crowds

All hail festival fashion! Who needs denim shorts and some wellies when you can dress up as an astronaut and a pair of nuns like these revellers, who opted for fancy dress to enjoy the sunset at the stone circle on day one of Glastonbury Festival

Attention to detail: One diligent festival goer ensured that he had every inch of his body inked, wore some bling on his nipples and even treated his toe nails to a colourful pedicure ahead of the iconic music event

Bottoms up! One stylish female festival goer rocks an on-trend bucket hat, denim jacket and oversized pants, sorry, shorts...

Multitasking: Sophie Gray, 25 and Clara Talbot, 26 from Liverpool arrive with rollers in their hair on the first day of Glastonbury....we hope they packed umbrellas!

Flower power: Floral headbands seem to be the order of the day at Glastonbury
