It was the Saturday that saw more refereeing controversy in the Barclays Premier League as Neil Swarbrick mistakenly sent off West Brom's Gareth McAuley instead of Craig Dawson at Manchester City.

And after that unfortunate incident after just 63 seconds, City cruised to a 3-0 win to trim Chelsea's lead at the top to three points.

Arsenal stayed in touch as Olivier Giroud scored twice at Newcastle United, while Harry Kane grabbed his first Premier League hat-trick in Tottenham's 4-3 win over Leicester City.

There were also wins for West Ham, Swansea, Southampton and Crystal Palace.

Each week, Sportsmail collates the ratings of our reporters around the grounds to bring you the Premier League team of the day.

GOALKEEPER - Boaz Myhill (Manchester City vs WEST BROM) 8

Down to 10 men after just two minutes against a City side determined to prove a point after a recent slump, West Brom were really up against it.

Myhill led the resistance with a succession of excellent saves, in the end limiting the damage to just three goals.

DEFENCE - Jores Okore (ASTON VILLA vs Swansea City) 7

The Denmark international produced one of the more positive performances as Aston Villa slumped to a disappointing home defeat at the hands of Swansea.

DEFENCE - Ashley Williams (Aston Villa vs SWANSEA CITY) 7

At the opposite end, Williams and his central defensive partner Federico Fernandez produced assured performance to earn a clean sheet and keep the Swans in the top half of the table.

DEFENCE - John O'Shea (West Ham vs SUNDERLAND) 7

After the early withdrawal of Wes Brown through injury, O'Shea stepped up and drew on his extensive leadership to marshal the Sunderland defence.

Alas, they couldn't quite hold out and claim a precious point in Dick Advocaat's first game in charge.

DEFENCE - Neil Taylor (Aston Villa vs SWANSEA) 7.5

A hard-fought win for Swansea in which Taylor's block of a close-range Gabriel Agbonlahor effort early in the second-half proved crucial.

Taylor also delivered plenty of crosses from the left, setting up Bafetimbi Gomis, who would later prove Swansea's match-winner.

MIDFIELD - Charlie Adam (STOKE CITY vs Crystal Palace) 7.5

Was his usual dogged self in the Stoke midfield but couldn't inspire a victory as Palace emerged from the Britannia with all three points.

MIDFIELD - David Silva (MANCHESTER CITY vs West Brom) 8.5

The outstanding player in City's comfortable win over West Brom, which cut Chelsea's lead to three points - at least temporarily.

The Spaniard tormented the Baggies defence throughout and scored City's third goal when he turned in Stevan Jovetic's shot.

MIDFIELD - Nabil Bentaleb (TOTTENHAM vs Leicester) 7.5

A crazy game at White Hart Lane but Bentaleb stood out for his performance in the Spurs midfield, protecting the defence and picking passes to free the front-runners.

Was fortunate the referee didn't spot a slap on Leonardo Ulloa, however.

FORWARD - Wilfried Bony (MANCHESTER CITY vs West Brom) 8

A day to savour for the Ivorian, who opened his account for Manchester City with a well-taken goal after 27 minutes.

Having been involved in the game-changing sending off after just two minutes, Bony broke the deadlock with a neat flick turn and finish.

FORWARD - Olivier Giroud (Newcastle United vs ARSENAL) 8

A striker in a real purple patch, Giroud continued his hot streak with a double up at Newcastle to take his run to nine in his last nine matches.

His first may have been a fortuitous deflection on Danny Welbeck's header but his second was an effortless header.

FORWARD - Harry Kane (TOTTENHAM vs Leicester) 8.5

Undoubtedly the player of the day, Kane claimed his first Premier League hat-trick with a bravura performance against Leicester at the Lane.

Taking his season tally to 29 goals - including 19 in the Premier League - Kane was simply unstoppable on Saturday.
