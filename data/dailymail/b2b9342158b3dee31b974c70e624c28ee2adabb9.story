Joshua Bonehill, 22, from Yeovil, Somerset, has been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated harassment and malicious communications

A former public schoolboy has been arrested in connection with a string of anti-Semitic messages sent to an MP.

Joshua Bonehill, 22, who is said to be behind an anti-Jewish rally organised for Stamford Hill, north London, next month, was arrested following allegations of abusive messages being sent to Labour MP Luciana Berger.

Ms Berger, MP for Liverpool Wavertree and shadow minister for public health, has previously called on Twitter to do more to stop online abuse after receiving 2,500 anti-Semitic tweets in just three days last year.

Metropolitan Police confirmed that a man had been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated harassment and malicious communications at an address in Yeovil, Somerset, on Friday.

A Met Police spokesman added: 'Officers investigating allegations of malicious communications sent to a Member of Parliament via a social-media network have arrested a man.

'He was bailed to a west London police station until the end of March.'

Hackney Borough Police also took to Twitter to confirm the arrest, writing: 'We can confirm a 22 year old man from Yeovil was arrested by Hackney officers investigating allegations of inciting racial hatred.

'The man has been bailed with conditions. Any breach of those bail conditions will be dealt with appropriately and proportionately.'

Mr Bonehill wrote about his arrest on his self-titled blog and said he was 'completely shocked and traumatised by the incident'.

He also claimed that his bail conditions prevent him from travelling inside the M25 – meaning he could be unable to attend the Stamford Hill protest if it goes ahead.

He wrote: 'The police officers told me that I was to be arrested for one count of racial hate, one count of political harassment and one count of malicious communications, at this point, I could only assume that it was to do with liberate stamford hill.'

'In other words, I have been banned from London and this is due to last until the 26th of March 2015.'

The 'Liberate Stamford Hill' protest, which has been advertised on social media as the 'Jewification of Great Britain', targets the north London area because of its large Jewish population. It has been planned for March 22.

Earlier this month, a report by the Community Security Trust (CST) revealed that attacks against British Jews have reached a record high.

Officials at the group, which monitors anti-Semitism and provides security for the Jewish community, recorded 1,168 anti-Semitic incidents in 2014.

This was more than double the 535 incidents recorded in 2013 and the highest annual total ever recorded.

The incidents ranged from violent attacks in the street to vile graffiti and criminal damage against synagogues and homes.

The bloody conflict in Gaza and Israel is the single biggest contributor to the rise, the CST said.

A CST spokesman told The Independent: 'We welcome this arrest and hope this puts an end to his supposed march in Stamford Hill.

'We're pleased to see hate on social media is being taken seriously by the authorities.'
