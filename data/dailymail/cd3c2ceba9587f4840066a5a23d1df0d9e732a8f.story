A 17th century stately home has been left partially destroyed after it was ravaged by a fire.

Nearly 100 firefighters battling to save Grade I listed Sydenham House, in Devon, were forced to evacuate the area at one point because it was feared the burning property would collapse.

The roof and much of the first floor have been left in ruins after flames tore through the house yesterday, and the owner now faces having to rebuild parts of the property at a cost of millions.

Battle: At one point yesterday evening, firefighters working to quench the flames at Sydenham House, Devon, were forced to evacuate due to fears the entire building could collapse

Nearly 100 firefighters rushed to tackle the flames when the blaze broke out at historic Sydenham House

An investigation has been launched into what caused the fire, which broke out in a first floor bedroom at around 4pm yesterday

An investigation has been launched into what caused the devastating fire, which broke out in a first floor bedroom inside Sydenham House at around 4pm.

Owner Graeme Hart who bought the property and the surrounding 1,200 acre estate in 1992, learned of the blaze when his secretary telephoned him to say his home was in flames. He said the fire was 'tragic'.

'It could not have been more severe,' said Mr Hart, who had rushed home to see flames 'coming through the roof'.

'I was out during the day. I was phoned by my secretary to say there were flames coming out of the window. Immediately I returned to find the situation. It was tragic.'

Mr Hart said he was determined to restore the building to its former glory in the wake of the blaze.

'It has got to be rebuilt,' he said. 'It is a historic Grade I listed building.'

'Dangerous scene': Firefighters perched on a ladder spray water onto the flames at the house, which is thought to have been built between 1600 and 1612

He also praised the efforts of firefighters who battled to bring the fire under control.

'The firefighters have come from all corners of Devon and Cornwall,' he said.

'They have done a brilliant job.'

A spokesman for Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said the glow from the flames would have been visible for miles around as the roof and most of the first floor of the stately home near Launceston had been 'well alight'.

After: Part of the Elizabethan stately home in Devon has been destroyed by the blaze, which 15 fire crews battled to put out

Fire crews used eight jet hoses to blast water pumped from a nearby lake onto the flames

'Fortunately the house was evacuated when the alarm was raised so there are no injuries,' said the spokesman.

A total of 15 fire crews used eight jet hoses to quench the flames, using water pumped from a nearby lake.

'It
was a dangerous scene. At one point there was a risk the building would
collapse, so we had to withdraw the firefighters,' the fire service 
spokesman said.

Area commander Chris Bridgeman said 'hidden voids' inside the rambling property meant the fire spread rapidly.

'With it being heavily wooden inside it was very unsafe, so we were unable to work inside for any length of time,' he said.

Fire crews said 'hidden voids' inside the rambling, largely wooden building caused the blaze to spread rapidly

Ruins: Charred and blackened tiles on the roof of Sydenham House, near Launceston

Aftermath: Fire trucks outside Sydenham House after yesterday's fire

Before: Sydenham House is seen before the fire broke out on the first floor of the Grade I listed building

Sydenham House was built some time between 1600 and 1612 for Sir Thomas Wise, an MP.

The privately-owned property forms part of the Sydenham Estate, which organises farming and shooting functions.

The sporting history of the building can be traced back to the early 1900s, when it played host to pheasant shoots.

When Mr Hart and his wife Hilary bought the estate in 1992 they were determined to restore it to its former sporting glory, and they introduced shoots once again.

An investigation is now underway at the house to establish what is salvageable following the fire and whether parts of the property may be unsafe.

Imposing: The house, seen before the blaze, was built for the politician Sir Thomas Wise, who sat in the House of Commons in the 17th century
