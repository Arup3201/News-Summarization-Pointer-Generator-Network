Paul Fleiss, the pediatrician father of former Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, has died aged 80.

The beloved doctor, who pleaded guilty in 1995 to conspiring to hide profits from his daughter's prostitution ring, passed away in his Los Angeles home on Saturday with his son Jesse by his side.

Radar Online reported he died from complications after being hit by a car about six months ago.

'He cycled every Sunday with a friend, until he was hit by a car,' a family insider said.

Jesse 
Fleiss heard his dad struggling to breathe and called 911 on Saturday morning, but he was 
pronounced dead at the scene when paramedics arrived.

Although
 Dr Fleiss rose to fame in the 1990s when his daughter's exclusive 
call-girl ring was exposed, he was known to many as a dedicated 
children's doctor.

Dr Fleiss, an avid cycler, was known for his
gentle bedside manner and continuing to make house calls into his old age. He also ran his own medical practice.

While
 he 
was a pediatrician to the children of several Hollywood celebrities, he 
also looked after patients whose families could not afford to pay him.

A
 vocal opponent of circumcision, he penned the landmark 2002 book, 'What
 Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Circumcision', outlining 
misconceptions and myths around the common surgery.

Tributes have poured in on social media for the renowned doctor, with many of his patients describing him as a 'champion of infant health, breastfeeding, and conscious parenting'.

'My children were beyond lucky to have this delightful, gentle man as their pediatrician, Los Angeles mom Erin Riley wrote on Facebook.

'He blazed a path away from old accepted child rearing beliefs, such as corporal punishment, and and a doctor-knows-best attitude to focus parenting and health care on the child as an individual and as a whole person.'

Mom Stephanie Glazer Wieland wrote: 'He gave me the confidence to nurse my daughter, even through emergency gallbladder surgery when she was only 3 weeks old, and when the hospital doctors were telling me I was crazy and should just switch to formula.'

Dr Fleiss was born on September 8, 1933, in 
Detroit. He trained as a pharmacist and osteopath and moved to Los Angeles
wher he completed a residency in 
pediatrics at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. His marriage to Elissa Ash, Heidi Fleiss' mother, ended in divorce.

'Hollywood madam to the stars': Heidi Fleiss, who was convicted on pandering charges in late 1994, appears in court on 30 January 1995 for a hearing to request a retrial

The father-of-six was infamously convicted in 1995 for signing the mortgage to a luxury home used as a base for his daughter's illegal escort business.

Surrounded by hundreds of his supporters in court, Dr Fleiss was sentenced to three yearsâ€™ probation, 625 hours of community service and a $50,000 fine. However he escaped a lengthy prison term and his medical license was not suspended.

'I never intended to cheat or lie or steal,' Dr Fleiss said outside the courtroom. 'I only wanted to help my daughter.'

His daughter apologized for her dad's troubles, saying outside court: 'I'm so sorry. He didn't deserve any of this.'

Heidi Fleiss, who began a prostitution ring in 1990, had call-girls who serviced some of the biggest stars in Hollywood, such as Charlie Sheen and Timothy Hutton.

Fleiss was arrested in 1994 following a police sting in which one of her girls was arrested and cooperated with the police.

She was convicted on a slew of charges, including pandering, which were overturned in 1996. She was later charged and convicted of tax evasion, was imprisoned for 20 months and was released to a halfway house in 1998 where she lived for about a year.

Dr Fleiss was back in the news in October 1996, a year after his sentencing, when he announced outside Good Samaritan Hospital that singer Madonna had given birth to a girl, Lourdes.

Dr Fleiss is survived by daughters Heidi, Amy, Shana and Kim., and son Jesse. His son Jason died in a drowning accident.
