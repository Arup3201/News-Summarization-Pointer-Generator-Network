Shane Watson admits that he was apprehensive batting in the nets on Friday, but is now feeling confident that Australia will have a full-strength XI in the first Test.

Watson and the entire squad remain stricken with grief following the shock death of Phillip Hughes.

But the 33-year-old expects to be mentally ready for Tuesday, when Australia's four-Test series against India starts at Adelaide Oval.

The all-rounder is likewise confident his 10 teammates will find a way to take the field.

'Everyone is progressing well ... competitive juices will be up and running, especially after (losing) the last Test series we played in India,' he said.

Batting has always come easy to Watson - broad shouldered, confident and capable of bludgeoning an attack.

But the past couple of days provided some of his toughest moments as a cricketer.

'There's a lot of inner demons we've had to find our way through,' Watson said of Australia's recent training sessions.

Watson was in the field for NSW when Hughes was struck by a bouncer.

It is a traumatic image that will stay in the mind of everyone present at the SCG on November 25.

Watson has slowly turned his attention to facing India after attending Hughes' funeral on Wednesday.

'It's been the most challenging, mentally, couple of days I've had to go through in my career,' Watson said on Sunday.

'A few things flooded into my head as soon as I went out to bat - I thought I'd processed quite well over the previous week.

'The memories I've got that are very much in the front of my mind.

'You never expect anything to this extent - what happened to Phillip.'

Watson said he was initially apprehensive facing bouncers in the nets.

'But I've got more comfortable with just reacting to what I see and trusting my skill,' he said.

'I'm certainly getting much better. I know by Tuesday that I'll be ready to go.'

The strain has occasionally showed while Australia trained in recent days.

But Mitchell Johnson on Sunday got back to what he does best - sending down a testing bouncer to each of the Marsh brothers.

Watson suggested his own mental struggles were only with the willow.

'For me, bowling's a hell of a lot easier than batting because you have to make sure you hold your nerve while guys are steaming in,' he said.

Watson spent over an hour batting on Sunday, returning for some throwdowns from bowling coach Craig McDermott when most players had shuffled back to the rooms.

'It is not a lack of preparation, it is more about getting my head clear,' Watson said.

'Yesterday I also had a very long session and mentally it is a very big challenge.

'You know that if at any stage you get a ball and you get unlucky, and it hits you in the wrong spot - it can cause some serious damage.'
