It claims to be a survival show in which 13 ‘ordinary’ men are marooned on a desert island to fend for themselves for a month.

Yesterday however TV adventurer Bear Grylls and Channel 4 found themselves embroiled in a fakery row over The Island after it emerged that several of the contestants are professionals used to thriving in extreme conditions – and some of the scenes have been staged.

In last week’s opening episode, the dehydrated camp-mates were seen running out of time to find a source of fresh drinking water.

Bear Grylls' new Channel 4 show, The Island, has been accused of fakery after producers tampered with the environment

Kiff McManus (circled left), Rupert Smith (circled, third from left), Dan Etheridge (circled, second from right) and Matt Bennett (circled, far right) have worked as crew in other extreme programmes before

When they eventually located one, 
viewers were not told that the murky supply was in fact a rubber-lined 
pool put there by the production crew.

It has also transpired that two caimans – a species of crocodile – were let loose for the group to catch.

This was not disclosed in the broadcast.

Introducing
 the first episode of the five-part series, Grylls said he wanted to 
‘find out what happens if you strip a man of all the luxuries and 
conveniences of modern living and then force him to fight for his 
existence’.

He claimed that 
the contestants were ‘ordinary men about to be abandoned on a Pacific 
island with just the clothes they stand up in and a few tools’.

Nine
 were introduced in the first episode: call centre worker Ryan McHugh, 
21; ex-police officer Tony Fletcher, 70; leakage engineer Craig Brown, 
26; hairdresser Dean Smith, 24; neurologist Sam Nightingale, 33; sheep 
farmer Joe Birch, 23; IT trainer Mike Fletcher, 37; actor Sackie 
Osakonor, 28; and business coach Christopher Barrow, 60.

Channel 4 have said they released two caymen onto the island to sustain the men and replenish the natural habitat

The series showed the men capturing and killing the caymen for food as part of their desert island experience

A spokesman for the channel insisted the men still had to catch the animals for food, as seen in the show 

However four other men were not.

They all have experience of surviving extreme conditions and some have previously worked with Grylls.

Rupert
 Smith worked with him on Channel 4’s Escape To The Legion and cameraman
 Dan Etheridge worked with Grylls on Man vs Wild. Sound recordist Kiff 
McManus has ten years’ experience working in hostile conditions, while 
Matt Bennett was part of the team behind Sky’s Ross Kemp On Gangs.

Channel
 4 said in a statement:  ‘It clearly states in the programme voiceover 
that trained crew are part of the experiment, living under exactly the 
same conditions as the other men.

Crew members including Matt Bennett (above left), Rupert Smith (above right), Kiff McManus (below left) and Matt Bennett (below right) have worked on similar shows in the past

‘Like all of the men on the Island, their professions are captioned on screen and their backgrounds are discussed.’

Of
 the claims of fakery, it said the caimans were let loose on the 
uninhabited island to ensure there was enough ‘native wildlife’ to keep 
the 13 men fed.

It 
added: ‘We had to ensure the island’s only water supply, a muddy pool, 
would last through filming in the dry season and that there were enough 
native animals and native vegetation that could sustain the men for 28 
days – as long as they had the ingenuity to find it, catch it and kill 
it.’

A water source on the island was also lined and 'topped up' by crew to ensure they had enough water

Producers of The Island with Bear Grylls - in which 13 men are marooned on the desert island - have been accused of fakery over the issues

It is not the first time Grylls, 39, has been accused of fakery.

In
 2008, he apologised to viewers after it was revealed that during Born 
Survivor, also broadcast on Channel 4, he had stayed in a hotel and not 
camped as the show claimed.

Viewers tweeted their anger at the new revelations.

One said: ‘People are actually shocked that The Island with Bear Grylls is fake?’

Bear Grylls is not the only star to have his TV showed hit by accusations of fakery.

In 2011, the BBC was criticised for including footage of baby polar bears in its Frozen Planet series, which it later emerged was filmed in a zoo.

A voice over by Sir David Attenborough spoke of the cubs being born 'beneath the snow', but the corporation said the script was 'carefully worded' and did not mislead the audience.

The BBC's Frozen Planet was criticised when it emerged footage of two tiny polar bear cubs was actually filmed in a Dutch zoo

The BBC's Top Gear also came under fire last year after it was claimed actors were brought in to replace members of the public during one of the show's stunts.

Viewers watched as a makeshift hovercraft put together by Jeremy Clarkson  and his fellow presenters splashed diners sitting alongside the River Avon, but is was later alleged the people were played by actors.

The BBC refused to comment on the claims but a senior source said at the time: ‘Top Gear is an entertainment programme and I don’t think viewers would have been taken in.’

In January this year, Channel 5 came in for criticism after a crew member was apparently filmed inside the house, holding up cue cards to the housemates, who are not supposed to have contact with the outside world.

Makers of Top Gear were hit by claims that actors were brought in to play members of public during one of the show's stunts last year

A Big Brother spokesman claimed: 'Sometimes members of the task team enter the Big Brother house but they do not communicate with housemates.'

And, earlier this year, TV hit Gogglebox was embroiled in a similar row after one of its stars claimed the programme is scripted.

Makers of the Channel 4 show, which films families watching TV, were accused of telling participants how to react and feeding them funny comments.

A source said to have starred in the show also claimed they were made to change clothes to make it look like the programme was filmed on different days.

A Channel 4 spokesman insisted the cast are filmed two or three times a week and said there was 'no truth' in claims the show is scripted.

Gogglebox was accused of being scripted but star Leon Bernicoff, pictured with wife June, wrote online: 'Nobody tells ME what to say unless it's June. We watch things as they go out or later.'
