A 92-year-old war veteran who shot dead an intruder at his home says he has only one regret - that he didn't shoot the alleged burglar's accomplices.

Earl Jones from Boone County, Kentucky, killed Lloyd (Adam) Maxwell after the intruder broke into his home at 2am on Monday with two accomplices.

He told the Enquirer: 'These people aren’t worth any more to me than a groundhog. They have our country in havoc. We got so many damned crooked people walking around today.'

Jones said that on the night of the shooting, he heard a bang 
coming from the basement and walked eight paces to get his loaded .22 
caliber rifle from behind the bedroom door.

He then returned to his armchair 
in the living room where he had been watching the TV and lay in wait for
 the intruders to enter.

When Maxwell kicked the basement door open 15 minutes later Mr Jones fired off a shot at his chest and killed him.

Maxwell's accomplices Ryan Dalton, 22, and Donnie Inabnit, 20,then fled, dragging the dead man with them.

It was the third time the pensioner, who has worked on the same farm since 1955, has been broken into this year.

Earl Jones said she was only sorry that two others who took part in the raid escaped unharmed.

'I was hoping another one would come up – I aimed right for his heart,' he said.

Jones also showed little emotion over killing 24-year-old Lloyd Maxwell who was gunned down during the home invasion.

'Was I scared? Was I mad? Hell, no.

“It was simple. That man was going to take my life. He was hunting me. I was protecting myself.”

Jones, who served in army during WW2, was alone at his 500 acre ranch in Verona, Kentucky, when he heard noises outside.

Police do not expect to charge Jones 
with a crime as Kentucky as the state has a "stand your ground law" that
 allows householders to use deadly force if they are in fear of their 
lives.

Jones is adamant that he was within his right to shoot the intruder at the home he has lived in since 1955.

The break-in was the third he has experienced in this year.

'I didn’t go to war for nothing. I 
have the right to carry a gun. That’s what I told the police this 
morning.” according to the Enquirer newspaper.

Police said Dalton, 22, and  Inabnit, 20, were arrested later.

The pair called police to report their friend had been shot. They later admitted to taking part in the raid on Jones's home.

Dalton and Inabnit, both from Dry 
Ridge, have been charged with second degree burglary and tampering with 
evidence, but Mr Jones may yet escape conviction thanks to Kentucky's 
'castle doctrine' which is enshrined in law.

Nationally the killing of criminals by individuals trying to defend their property has increased in recent years, from 196 in 2005 to 278 in 2010, according to FBI Uniform Crime Report statistics.

Kenton County Police found Maxwell’s body and two uninjured men in a 2001 Chevrolet Impala who later admitted to being at Jones' home.

In April, thieves stole 90 of Mr Jones' cows from a field behind his property and in August burglars took a television, a several thousand dollars and a personal cheque from his house.
