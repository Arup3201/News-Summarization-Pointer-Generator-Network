It had seemed like perhaps the world's most disastrous marriage proposal.

Thousands watched what appeared at first glance to be mobile phone footage of a hapless romeo asking for his girlfriend's hand in marriage, only to be clumped around the head with a busker's ukulele.

But it appears that tens of thousands of YouTube viewers have been duped - the video is in fact a clever piece of marketing by Cadbury.

I most certainly won't: The moment the man's public marriage proposal goes disastrously wrong when his would-be bride clumps him round the head with a ukulele - but it's all a clever marketing campaign for Cadbury

The cringeworthy footage, thought to 
have been shot in a shopping mall in Dubai, went viral after it was 
posted onto the video sharing website attracting hundreds of comments, 
with some concerned viewers even addressing the jilted man.

But the hilarious clip is actually part of confectioner Cadbury's new Not So Sweet advertising campaign aimed at young adults who prefer dark chocolate that's not so sweet.

The clip shows the man, described as an 'Indian teen', and the girl walk up to a group of buskers in the shopping centre.

As the musicians begin to play he takes a microphone and launches into a gooey speech saying: 'I have a very special message for a very special girl. This is where we met three months ago.

'You are my charm, you are my sweety pie, you are my cutie pie, my absolute everything, and I know you find this cheesy but I want everyone to know, you make me really happy.'

As a crowd gathers things start going badly for the man when a toy town-style mall train drives past, breaking the mood and the embarrassed girl mutters 'Oh my god everyone's watching.'

As MailOnline reported, there was a strong suggestion that the video could be a stunt - the train has a Cadbury Bournville logo emblazoned along its side and the 'Not So Sweet' slogan.

Here goes: The man, backed by a group of buskers, begins his proposal speech in a Dubai shopping mall

Popping the question: He drops down on one knee to ask the girl to be his bride as she begs him to stop

Blam: The furious girl swings the busker's miniature guitar catching the unwanted suitor around the head

Undaunted the man continues: 'I have a little poem for you and I want everyone to hear this.

'When you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while. And my heart ceases to beat and there is nothing else I seek except you.'

As he gets down on one knee the girl begs him to stop but he continues: 'And I Just have one question for you. You truly make me that happiest person on earth.'

Love hurts: The man lies in a crumpled heap on the ground before the girl storms off

But the girl simply cannot take anymore and she snatches the miniature guitar out of the hands of one of the buskers and whacks her suitor round the head with it sending him to the floor in a crumpled heap.

She then throws the instrument onto the ground and and storms off.

The Cadbury 'Not So Sweet' campaign has focused on social media and includes a Twitter campaign called Tape a Tweet.

It encourages Twitter users to tweet a situation that is overly sweet which the company then turns into a short video.

Fooled: The video ties in with a viral campaign to promote Cadbury's Bournville chocolate
