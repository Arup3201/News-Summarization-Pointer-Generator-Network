Accused: Jordan McKay Nelson, 23, has been accused of locking the four children in dog cages

A step-mum has been accused of locking her four young children in a dog cage in a dark basement as punishment, it has been reported. 

Jordan McKay Nelson, 23, also allegedly forced the youngsters to eat dog food, which caused one six-year-old boy to vomit violently.

The children, aged between five to nine years old, were held under 'terrorising conditions', according to court documents in North Dakota, USA.

Nelson is also accused of turning out the lights when the children were locked into the cages as a form of punishment.

During a police interview, one nine-year-old boy drew a picture of himself in the kennel with the words 'Help me'.

A police affidavit says Nelson is in a relationship with the children's biological mother. 

The complaint read: 'The previously stated actions are also enough to cause permanent mental injury to the juveniles.' 

Nelson has been charged with four counts of abuse, neglect of a child and felonious restraint. 

A preliminary hearing has been set for April 13.

Her lawyer has not yet returned phone calls seeking comment on his client. 

She was released on bond and ordered to stay away from the children, who live in the city of Grafton in North Dakota.
