These extraordinary photographs document the fascinating lives of a teen gang living in Brooklyn, New York, in the 1950s.

The images are part of a collection called Brooklyn Gang, and were taken by renowned photographer Bruce Davidson, 80, who has dedicated his career to documenting New York City life and culture.

This collection is especially interesting as it follows a group of teens, who called themselves the Jokers, who lived in the city in 1959.

Gangs of New York: This collection details the lives of a teen gang - who called themselves The Jokers - living in Brooklyn, New York, in the 1950s

In it together: The gang, photographed by the legendary artist Bruce Davidson, pose outside a diner in downtown Brooklyn circa 1959

Young love: One of the gang's couples get amorous on a beach. The photographer was inspired to capture the gang's lives after hearing about fights in the city

When the photographer was 25, he read about a series of fights breaking out in one of the city's open spaces - Prospect Park.

It is thought there were around 1,000 gang members living in New York in the fifties and intrigued, Mr Davidson went to Brooklyn in search of some insight.

Before long, he found these teens who befriended him, allowing him to take photographs of their fascinating lives.

In the images, the group can be seen hanging out in various locations around the city - including diners, down street alleys and in sun-ridden parks.

Concrete jungle: One of the gang members swings on a pipe down a city alley way. In 1959, there were around 1,000 gang members in New York

Cool characters: A gang member chats while leaning against a juke box. The artist said he really got to know each member well over the months they worked together

Killing time: The friends hang out in a park while one girl - around 15 years old - fixes her hair and smokes a cigarette

Sometimes, the male gang members are joined by females, with several of the shots depicting scenes of amorous young love.

The images also give an insight into 
the fashions of the time - with the gang members all dressed in classic 
fifties attire including collared shirts.

The males all support quiffs, while the females have a selection of up-dos.

Writing in the afterword of the collection, Mr Davidson said: 'I met a group of teenagers called the Jokers.

'I was 25 and they were about 16. I could easily have been taken for one of them.'

'In time they allowed me to witness their fear, depression and anger.

Brothers in arms: Two friends and members of the Jokers smile as they lift their shirt sleeves to reveal their tattoos

'I soon realised that I, too, was 
feeling their pain. In staying close to them, I uncovered my own 
feelings of failure, frustration and rage.'

However, the story does not stop there.

In 1998 when a publisher had approached the photographer about his collection, Bobby Powers - the once leader of the gang got in touch with the family.

Over a period of ten years, the photographer's wife Emily spoke with My Powers, speaking with him about his struggle to overcome his drug infested, violent past.

Mrs Davidson wrote a book - called Bobby's Book - about the tales Mr Powers told, following his fascinating life from member of a gang to drug addiction counselor.
