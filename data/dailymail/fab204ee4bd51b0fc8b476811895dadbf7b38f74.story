Louis van Gaal will settle in at Carrington once the World Cup has finished, with his wife Truus already searching for houses in Alderley Edge.

The Dutchman replaced David Moyes as manager after a dismal season at Old Trafford in which they meekly surrendered the Premier League title and failed to qualify for Europe.

Van Gaal has a job on his hands to haul the Reds up off their knees when he assumes control this summer.

But finding somewhere to live doesn't appear to be a problem as Truus sauntered around the leafy village south of Manchester known for its celebrity inhabitants.

The area has forever been a magnet for the players and managers alike from both United and City.

Mario Balotelli rented a mansion there while he was at the Etihad Stadium, with former boss Roberto Mancini also residing there.

The average house price in Alderley Edge is more than a cool £1.5million.

Sir Alex Ferguson had a property there while in charge at United with both Rio Ferdinand and Michael Carrick also in the village.

Van Gaal only revealed on Monday that he was primed to join Tottenham Hotspur before eventually taking the United role.

‘It was very close. Very close,' he said. 'As a little boy I was a fan of Tottenham Hotspur with the team of Jimmy Greaves when he was the champion. Jimmy Greaves was my idol. They had fantastic white shirts. So I was very close.’

Trouble: Van Gaal has to do his utmost to cajole performances from Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata next year
