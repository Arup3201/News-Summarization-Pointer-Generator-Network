News International boss Tom Crone quit as legal boss today after 26 years with the company

Rupert Murdoch has had discussions with News Corp executives about selling off all his UK newspapers, it was revealed today.

In the wake of the hacking scandal, senior bosses met to discuss the pros and cons of disposing of The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times.

The Wall Street Journal - one of Murdoch's own papers - reported that the media mogul had discounted a wholesale sell-off, but will revisit the issue in six months.

Today as the scandal deepened, News International legal manager Tom Crone resigned from the company. Sources told Sky News he had been placed on 90 days gardening leave.

Questions had been raised about how much he knew about phone hacking after he led the first internal investigation in 2007.

The trained barrister had worked for the company for 26 years and signed off some of the News of the World's most controversial frontpages.

News International declined to confirm whether he resigned or was asked to leave.

A source in the legal world close to Mr Crone described him as 'an incredibly professional and very clever Fleet Street lawyer'.

The source said: 'Tom was very much a hands-on man when it came to the News of the World. He was always there on a Saturday.

'He would usually be the only lawyer on a Saturday handling pre-publication reading.

'Tom is very quiet. He doesn't suffer
fools gladly. He can be very abrupt and dismissive of people when he 
thinks they are being stupid.

'He
has always managed the News of the World and the Sun very closely. He 
would very regularly pick up the phone to someone and say "Let's just 
settle this and get shot of it rather than incur huge legal costs".

Rupert Murdoch leaves his home in Mayfair, London, this morning with a copy of the Wall Street Journal by his side as speculation mounted that he could sell off his three British newspapers

'That
was his great art, having a very close sense of when it was sensible to
fight something and when it was sensible not to fight something. On 
many occasions he got it absolutely right.'

Mr
Crone, a family man who is a keen golfer, practised as a barrister for 
five years and worked as an in-house lawyer for the Mirror Group before 
joining News International in 1985.

As speculation mounted that Rupert 
Murdoch could sell all his papers, the Wall Street Journal revealed it 
was under consideration.

'One idea 
contemplated in recent weeks is an option Mr Murdoch has long shot 
down: selling his other British newspapers,' they reported.

'News
Corp has informally explored whether there were any potential buyers 
for its U.K. newspaper unit, News International, according to people 
familiar with the matter.'

This morning Rupert Murdoch was photographed leaving his Mayfair home with a copy of the American paper.

As speculation of a sell-off mounted, yesterday Murdoch's paper The Times said: 'City analysts asked whether News Corps could walk away.'

Les Hinton, the chief executive of 
Dow Jones and one of Mr Murdoch's most trusted aides jetted into London 
yesterday as the phone hacking fallout continues.

He was at the tycoon's Mayfair home yesterday along with Elisabeth Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks.

Yesterday
News Corporation announced a £3billion plan to buy back hundreds of 
millions of shares, which have fallen sharply in value amid the 
escalating crisis at his British newspaper division.

More
than £4.3billion has been wiped off the value of the company since last
week due to fears that fallout from the phone-hacking investigation at 
News International will infect other parts of Mr Murdoch’s business.

News
of the buy-back provided a temporary prop for the sagging News Corp 
share price, which rose for the first time in five days.
