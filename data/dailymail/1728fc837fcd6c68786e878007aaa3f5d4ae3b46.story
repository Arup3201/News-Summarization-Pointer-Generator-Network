General Mills was the only one of the top 10 food and drink companies in the world that had not improved its sourcing policies

The company that sells Haagen-Dazs, Green Giant and Yoplait in the UK has fallen to the bottom of an Oxfam ranking after failing to improve its social and environmental policies, the charity said.

General Mills, which also sells the Old El Paso and Betty Crocker brands, was the only one of the top 10 food and drink companies in the world that had not improved its sourcing policies, Oxfam said.

The charity's 'Behind the Brands' campaign measures the sourcing policies of the 10 biggest food and drink companies, looking at transparency, women's rights and rights of workers, farmers, land, water and climate.

Oxfam said that while progress had been made by some of the companies on land, women's rights and carbon emissions and some leading companies had made 'major strides', overall the 'big 10' had moved too slowly as a group.

It said that before the campaign launched a year ago, none of the 10 companies had policies to ensure their ingredients were not grown on land that had been taken from communities.

Now, six had policies to help ensure their suppliers were not involved in land grabs, seven had committed to improving conditions for women affected by their operations and eight had improved their policies on climate, mainly through better disclosing their emissions and risks related to climate change.

General Mills also sells Petits Filous made by Yoplait. The company has fallen to the bottom of Oxfam's list of companies for not improving its social and environmental policies

The rankings as listed by Oxfam for this year, showing a total score adding up points relating to land, women, farmers, workers, climate, transparency and water, are:1. Nestle 45/702. Unilever 44/703. Coca-Cola 38/704. Mondelez 23/704. PepsiCo 23/706. Danone 22/706. Mars 22/708. Kellogg's 20/709. Associated British Foods 19/7010. General Mills 15/70

Oxfam's campaigns and policy director, Ben Phillips, said: 'Consumer power and investors are pushing most of the top 10 food and drink companies in the right direction and we are beginning to see what this can mean for poor and vulnerable people.

'These companies, with so much power and influence, can do so much more and while some are showing leadership, others are clinging to a business model that is outdated and fails to respect human rights.

'Pressure from consumers is what pushed companies to be more responsible and so much more is possible if people continue to add their voice.'

The top three performers - Nestle, Unilever and Coca-Cola - all improved their scores by the biggest margins, Oxfam said.

A Greenpeace report blames the company which makes Head & Shoulders shampoo for using suppliers accused of clearing Indonesian rainforest

A Greenpeace report has blamed the company which makes Head & Shoulders shampoo for helping to wipe out orangutans. 

Proctor and Gamble, which makes the anti-dandruff shampoo, has been accused of failing to follow other companies by not using suppliers which are clearing parts of the Indonesian rainforest for palm oil. 

A year long investigation by the charity claims to have traced palm oil in Head & Shoulders shampoo and its shaving cream to suppliers accused of destroying the orangutans' habitat. 

The suppliers - BW Plantation, KLK and Musim Mas - were all slammed in the report.

Palm oil is an ingredient of so many day to day products. 

In too many cases rainforest is illegally destroyed to make way for palm oil plantations.

Of approximately 11 million hectares of oil palm plantations globally, about six million hectares are found in Indonesia.

But in many places, these plantations are taking over rainforests, the natural habitat of endangered species such as orangutans.

The Sumatran tiger is also under threat according to Greenpeace. 

Proctor and Gamble, whose Head & Shoulders advert stars England goalkeeper Joe Hart, said it is continuing its pledge that all of its palm oil will be 'sustainably sourced' by next year.

A spokesman said: 'P&G is committed to the sustainable sourcing of palm oil.  We have made a public commitment that, by 2015, 100 per cent of all palm oil purchases we make will be sustainably sourced and we are working with our suppliers to ensure we deliver on this commitment.

'We are strongly opposed to irresponsible deforestation practices and take any allegation of impropriety by our suppliers very seriously.

'We will investigate any allegations made to ensure that our policy on the responsible and sustainable sourcing of palm oil have been, and will continue to be, adhered to.

'P&G is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), we support the RSPO criteria established for sustainable palm oil, and we are part of the working group on sustainable sourcing of palm oil derivatives.'

She quit her role as Oxfam ambassador in a row over her controversial Super Bowl advert for SodaStream - and chose to keep her links with the Israeli fizzy drink firm.

Now speaking for the first time since she severed her ties with the humanitarian group, Scarlett Johansson insists she never saw herself as a role model in the first place.

In an interview with Dazed magazine, Johansson did not directly address the row with Oxfam, but said: 'I don’t see myself as being a role model; I never wanted to step into those shoes.

'How could I wake up every day and be a normal person if I was completely aware that my image was being manipulated on a global platform. How could I sleep?

'You have to have peace of mind. You’ve got to be able to protect those things. How else could you exist? You'd go crazy, anybody would go crazy.'

The row erupted after Johansson featured in an advert for the fizzy drinks firm which featured in the SuperBowl earlier this month.

The 29-year-old actress said she had a 'fundamental difference of opinion' with the charity after it said it opposed all trade from Israeli settlements because they say it is illegal and denies Palestinian rights.

SodaStream has a large factory in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank - a territory captured by Israel in 1967 and claimed by the Palestinians.

Johansson instead chose to keep her role as brand ambassador for SodaStream, saying she supports trade and 'social interaction between a democratic Israel and Palestine'.
