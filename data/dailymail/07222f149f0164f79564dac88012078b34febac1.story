Manchester United are dealing with a mice infestation at Old Trafford.

A hygiene report, seen by Sportsmail, reveals United are working with pest-control contractors to sort out problems with rodents in the North and South stands.

And it is understood that the vermin problem has spread to other parts of the ground, with rodents even spotted in staff offices.

On the back of the news that there is a mouse infestation at Old Trafford, here's our Rodent squad...

Goalkeeper: Andy Nibble 

Defence: Razvan Rat, David Lu-cheese, Mouse Mats Hummels, Thomas Vermin-aelen, Ashley Hole 

Midfield: Vasyl Rats, Mickey Mouse Thomas, Rat Nevin, Edam Hazard, Mathieu FlaMini-Mouse, Curtis Woodmouse

‘They’re a nightmare and they are struggling to get rid of them,’ a source said.

The problem is thought to be linked to the famous stadium’s canalside location.

In 2012, a similar report identified issues with mice in the staff canteen at the Stretford End while in 2010 a mouse was pictured scurrying over the pitch during United’s victory over West Ham.

Six years earlier, Burton players complained that there were mice all over the pitch during their FA Cup clash with United.

The hygiene report, carried out last year, tells staff to ‘continue to act on the recommendations of the pest-control contractor in connection with the mice activity’. It also advises them to make sure no food or waste is left out.

United say they carry out weekly checks and implement ‘immediate and appropriate action’ if mice are spotted.

A club spokesperson said: ‘Manchester United implements a robust pest-control system throughout Old Trafford. As the report acknowledges, weekly checks are made in all catering areas and stringent measures are taken to ensure high levels of hygiene and cleanliness wherever food is stored, prepared and served. If incidences of this nature do occur at the stadium, immediate and appropriate action will be taken.’

Sportsmail has also obtained the latest two hygiene reports from each Premier League ground in which a number of issues are reported, although most clubs were given top marks.

Mould was found in ice machines at Aston Villa and Swansea while Villa were advised that they did not have enough female stewards working on matchdays and told to keep an eye out for female fans smoking in the Holte End toilets. Both reports, however, gave the West Midlands club a 5/5 rating. At Anfield, inspectors found probe thermometers — used to check the temperatures of pies — were not being cleaned effectively between use and Liverpool were told to provide wipes.

Arsenal were told that some concessions staff at the Emirates Stadium were not changing gloves as often as they should, while at Leicester inspectors found droppings in the walk-in chiller. The club was told to remove them and disinfect the floor and the latest report gave them a clean bill of health and a 5/5 rating.

Kevin Keegan was nicknamed 'Mighty Mouse' at Hamburg during his three years at the club between 1977-80

Stoke were found to be using the same vacuum packer for raw and cooked foods at the Britannia Stadium. The Potteries club were warned about cross-contamination. West Brom were also informed of the same problem.

At Crystal Palace, inspectors said an ill-fitting kitchen door could allow pests inside and asked the club to fix it.

At Tottenham, a 2012 report said inspectors found paintwork in a kitchen to be in a ‘poor condition’ while ventilation grills were in need of more regular cleaning. But the most recent report, in 2014, gave Spurs a clean bill of health.

Other than a broken oven door and slight damage to a wall, there were no issues at Hull.

There were very good standards in place at all other Premier League clubs.
