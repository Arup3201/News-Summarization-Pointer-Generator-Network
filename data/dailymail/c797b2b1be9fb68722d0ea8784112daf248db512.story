The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge could tour China next year in a bid to help repair the damage caused by Prince Charles's diary description of Chinese officials as 'appalling old waxworks'.

Discussions are currently underway for the historic tour which would take place following the completion of Prince William's training for his new job as a pilot for the East Anglican air ambulance. 

It is not only seen as a diplomatic coup for the Foreign Office but also an important step to help repair the ill will felt towards the royals after Prince Charles' diary entries, published by the Mail on Sunday in 2006, described Chinese officials as 'appalling old waxworks'.

This year's tour of Australia and New Zealand proved to be massively successful. The couple, along with their son Prince George, were greeted by huge crowds throughout the tour and it contributed to a significant surge in the royal family's popularity.

Kensington Palace said: 'Next year's tours for the Duke and Duchess are currently being considered, discussed and assigned. They will be announced in due course.'

The Sunday Times also reported a spokesperson as saying China was 'looked at regularly because it is an important country that the Foreign Office want to send them to'.

The paper said officials hoped to capitalise on the current goodwill felt towards the couple.

Relations between Britain and China have been strained since a diplomatic row broke out in 2012 when Prime Minister David Cameron met the Dalai Lama.

At the time, China's foreign ministry said the May 2012 meeting between the exiled Tibetan leader, Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg had ‘seriously interfered with China’s internal affairs’.

The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in India since fleeing his Tibetan homeland in 1959 after a failed uprising against Communist rule.

The paper reported the tour would not take place until after Prince William has completed five months of training for his new job as a pilot with the East Anglican air ambulance.

Last summer Kensington Palace announced that the prince had decided to quit the military after seven years’ service, two-and-a-half of which were as a Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley on Anglesey.

He takes up the new job in spring next year and plans to donate his £40,000 salary to charity.

The Foreign Office declined to comment on the tour plans.
