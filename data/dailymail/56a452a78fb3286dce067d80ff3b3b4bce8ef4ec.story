Ever since the Cardiff Express Gareth Bale pulled out of London and into Madrid, English football’s top division has been bereft of a player with the pace, close control and courage to run with the ball from deep. 

Now, thanks to Real Madrid and Barcelona deciding they were surplus to requirements, Angel di Maria and Alexis Sanchez are tearing up the Premier League and terrorising its defences. 

Sportmail takes a look at what makes Manchester United’s No 7 and Arsenal’s No 17 so unstoppable.

PASSING AND VISION

It’s easier to find space in the Premier League than it is in Spain, where almost all teams have two defensive midfielders shielding the back four and often don’t come out of their own half – particularly if they are playing Real Madrid or Barca.

Alexis and Di Maria would have been used to playing tight games against teams camped in and around their own penalty area and neither can probably believe the space they are now finding in England. Cesc Fabregas has spoken about this key difference between La Liga and the Premier League.

'In England opponents come chasing you and it is easier to play a quick one-two and go beyond him into space,' he says. 

'You can’t do that in Spain where you are likely to be up against two very shrewd defensive midfielders.' 

Many of the players who move from La Liga to the Premier League talk about the anarchy of English football with the crowd roaring both sides on and players responding by throwing caution to the wind at the expensive of positional discipline. Both Di Maria and Alexis are bound to benefit.

PACE

It was once said of Lionel Messi that he runs faster with the ball than without it and it is easy to get the same impression watching Di Maria. 

The run down the left that led to Ander Herrera’s goal on Sunday was reminiscent of Ryan Giggs at his best. Alexis is also bursting with pace although perhaps not the same control over longer distances as the United man.

DRIBBLING

Both Sanchez and Di Maria can go past people in tight areas but neither will try to do so if they see a more efficient route to goal via either a shot or a cross. Both players have all the tricks but neither is a showman for the sake of it. The goals and assists statistics from last season prove that – it’s all about end product.

SET-PIECES

Did Di Maria over-hit that free-kick? Surely if he had over-hit it, it would have ended up in the seating behind the goal instead of the back of the net. 

It was a clever delivery perfectly measured to zip over the turf just in that dangerous area between advancing keeper and the back-pedaling defenders; designed to end in the far corner, or if someone got a touch on it, to beat the keeper at his near post. 

Both these two can score from set-pieces and both will be glad of having moved up the pecking order: Di Maria was behind Sergio Ramos, Cristiano Ronaldo and Bale at Real and Alexis behind Lionel Messi, Neymar and Xavi last season at Barca.

END PRODUCT

Sanchez scored 21 goals last season for Barcelona finishing behind only Messi in the scoring stakes.

It’s little wonder he has been increasingly used by his country through the middle, although with Arsenal dominating many of the games in which he plays up front means he spends too much time with his back to goal – a monumental waste of his ability to run into space.

Wenger seems to have realised that with the purchase of Danny Welbeck.

KILLER PASS

Di Maria played the final ball in 17 of Real Madrid’s goals last season and created a staggering 91 chances.

He topped the assist table in La Liga with Atletico Madrid’s Koke creating 68 chances and Cesc Fabregas, in his final season at Barcelona, 58. Sometimes the assist is unintentional.

In the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid last season it was his shot on goal that bobbled up for Bale to head Real Madrid in front. 

Sanchez also made it into double figures at Barcelona with 10 assists in La Liga. His decision making improved across his three seasons at the Nou Camp and Arsenal can now reap the benefits of that.
