A mother has been reunited with her baby after a woman lured her to her home and stole the child from inside her womb, it was reported today.

Brazilian Odete Barreto, 22, was 37 weeks pregnant when Daiana dos Santos, 21, invited her to her house telling her she had baby clothes to give away.

Once inside Santos knocked her out by hitting her over the head with a wooden plank.

Shocking: Daiana dos Santos attacked Odette Barreto and cut her baby out of her womb with a razor blade

The woman then used a razor blade to cut open Ms Barreto's belly before removing the baby.

Leaving the mother for dead, Santos took the baby into the street, claiming the child was hers.

Shocked neighbours ran inside and found Mrs Barreto in a pool of blood.

She and the baby were rushed to hospital and both stayed 15 days in intensive care in Manaus, northern Brazil.

Victim: An ID photograph of the Odete Barreto

According to police, Santos became desperate after being told earlier on September 27 that she wasn't pregnant, as she had believed.

She met her victim at the same health clinic where she had been given the bad news, and convinced her to come back with her to her house.

Police chief Adriano Feliz told Brazil's R7 website: "Doctors told her that she wasn't pregnant but that her bump was actually a myoma, she became hysterical, wanting to get a child any way she could.

'She was terrified that her husband would leave her when he discovered she wasn't expecting after all.'

Ms Barreto saw her baby for the first time yesterday, when both were released from hospital.

Santos is in isolation in Manaus' Anisio Jobin women's prison charged with attempted murder.
