A young couple suspected of using their family home as a cannabis farm were being quizzed by police today after their baby allegedly drowned in the bath.

Bride-to-be Emma Oliver, 20 and fiancee Dale Anderson, 23, were detained after their nine month daughter apparently got into difficulties while in the water with her 20 month old sister.

Oliver raised the alarm after finding little Daisy-Ray Anderson lying lifeless under the surface of the water at their home in Moston, Manchester.

The baby, who was born on Christmas Day
last year, and described as a 'little Princess', was rushed to North 
Manchester General Hospital near her home in Moston, Manchester but she 
died later.

Oliver and Anderson are being 
questioned on suspicion of child neglect and a separate offence of 
cultivating cannabis after 20 pot plants were discovered in a rear room 
of the house.

The couple who are believed to be known to social services were at home when tragedy struck at 12.50pm on Monday.

Neighbours said Oliver, a trainee 
plasterer, ran out of her home to raise the alarm and was hammering on 
doors begging people to call an ambulance.

One neighbour said: 'Emma came running
round banging on all our doors and said the baby was not breathing. I'd
been washing up and saw her running past the window.

'We ran in and Daisy was lying in the hallway with all teddies round her and Dale was trying to resuscitate her.

'Our instincts just kicked in and we 
rang the ambulance and they were there within minutes and tried to 
resuscitate her before they all went off in the ambulance.

'When the police came to the house 
later and we asked if the baby was okay the police woman said 'no, she's
died'. We had hoped that she was going to be okay.

'Emma didn't have a mobile and her pet rabbit had chewed through the landline phone so she couldn't ring for an ambulance'

'They didn't have much but they got on
and everybody stuck together and we all helped each other. It's a 
little community more like a village than an estate.

'Daisy was was born on Christmas day 
and now Emma and Dale are not going to be able to celebrate her first 
birthday or her first Christmas.

'Daisy will never be forgotten. She 
was beautiful and amazing. She was always smiling and I never saw her 
cry. She was obviously too perfect to be here.'

A third neighbour said: 'It was awful.
Emma doesn't have a phone so she came rushing round banging on the door
asking me to ring an ambulance.

'Daisy was an angel. She was such a happy, smiling little girl. She was so beautiful, too beautiful for this world.

'It's devastated this community as 
everyone knew little Daisy and they loved her. She's a good mum as well -
her two little girls were her world and I hate to think what she's 
going through.'

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman 
said: 'At 12.50pm on Monday 24 September 2012 police were called to 
North Manchester General Hospital following the death of a 
nine-month-old girl.

'The girl had been brought in by an 
ambulance crew from a house earlier in the day. An investigation to 
establish the circumstances surrounding the baby's death has been 
launched.

'A man and a woman have been arrested 
on suspicion of child neglect and cultivation of cannabis and remain in 
police custody for questioning.'

Today flowers and teddy bears were 
left outside the property as a mark of respect. A post-mortem 
examination was being held today to determine a cause of Daisy's death.

On her Facebook page Oliver said: 'I 
love my 2 girls my princess Lilly-Ashleigh & Daisy-Ray there my life
2012 wil be the best year ever wachin my 1y old do more things and 
walkin watchin my 2girl do the 1st 12 montsh of her love my kids more

In a message posted on the social 
networking site Ria Tindall said; 'Thinking ov u emma I couldn't emagine
what your goin through I'm always hear if you need me xx.'
