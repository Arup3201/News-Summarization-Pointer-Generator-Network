Our brains are wired to detect and process grammatical errors automatically without us even realising it, according to research from the University of Oregon. 

Previous studies concluded that our brains behave this way, yet neuroscientists from Oregon now have the evidence to back these claims up.

During a study of English speakers aged between 18 and 30, the scientists used  electroencephalography (EEG) to record changes in brain activity during an event, which in this case were short sentences presented visually one word at a time. 

During the grammatical error study at the University of Oregon, researchers tested how the participants' brains responded to sentences that were either grammatically correct, or contained a grammatical error. They recorded these changes in brain activity using EEG sensors, pictured

Electroencephalography (EEG) is the method of recording electrical activity using sensors placed on the scalp.

A brain's electrical charge is maintained by billions of neurons.

These neurons are electrically charged by proteins that send ions across their membranes.

Ions of similar charge repel each other.

As ions push away from each other they create a wave, like the one pictured. 

This process is known as volume conduction.

When the wave of ions reaches the electrodes on the scalp, they can push or pull electrons on the metal.

Since metal conducts the push and pull of electrons easily, the difference in push or pull voltages between any two electrodes can be measured by a voltmeter.

Recording these voltages over time gives us the EEG.

This change in brain signals is known as the Event-Related Potential (ERP). 

Participants were given 280 experimental sentences, including some that were syntactically, grammatically, correct and others containing grammatical errors.

For example, 'We drank Lisa's brandy by the fire in the lobby'  and 'We drank Lisa's by brandy the fire in the lobby.'

A 50 millisecond audio tone was also played at some point in each sentence. 

This could be before or after a grammatical error, or at a random point during a grammatically correct sentence.

According to lead researcher Laura Batterink, this method could show whether awareness was at work during the brain's processing of the errors.

'Participants had to respond to the tone as quickly as they could, indicating if its pitch was low, medium or high.' Batterink said.

'The grammatical violations were fully visible to participants, but because they had to complete this extra task, they were often not consciously aware of the violations.

Laura Batterink is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oregon. She recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) as study participants were given sentences containing grammatical errors. In the majority of cases, the participants processed the errors without even realising it

'They would read the sentence and have to indicate if it was correct or incorrect.

'If the tone was played immediately 
before the grammatical violation, they were more likely to say the 
sentence was correct even it wasn't.'

When tones appeared after grammatical errors, subjects detected 89% of the errors. 

In cases where subjects correctly declared errors in sentences, the researchers found a P600 effect.

The P600 effect is an ERP response in which the error is recognised and corrected automatically in order to make sense of the sentence.

When the tones appeared before the grammatical errors, subjects detected only 51% of them.

Co-author Helen J. Neville said that when the tone was played before the event it created a blink in the participant's attention. 

The key to conscious awareness, Neville continued, is based on whether or not a person can declare an error. 

And the tones disrupted participants' ability to do this. 

However, even when the participants did not notice these errors, their brains responded to them, generating an early negative ERP response. 

These undetected errors also delayed participants' reaction times to the tones.

Batterink said: 'Even when you don't pick up on a syntactic error your brain is still picking up on it.

'There is a brain mechanism recognising it and reacting to it, processing it unconsciously so you understand it properly.

Helen Neville, who co-authored the University of Oregon study looking into how our brains respond to grammatical errors, said that teaching strategies should be changed in light of the results. She added that children pick up grammar rules implicitly through daily interactions with parents or peers. Neville thinks that adults should be taught grammar in a similar way when learning a second language, to make the process easier

'While other aspects of language, such as semantics and phonology, can also be processed implicitly, the present data represent the first direct evidence that implicit mechanisms also play a role in the processing of syntax, the core computational component of language.'

Neville said that the results mean it may be time to reconsider teaching strategies, especially how adults are taught a second language.

Children, she noted, often pick up grammar rules implicitly through routine daily interactions with parents or peers, simply hearing and processing new words and their usage before any formal instruction. 

She likened such learning to 'Jabberwocky' - the nonsense poem introduced by Lewis Carroll in 1871 in 'Through the Looking Glass,'.

During this scene, Alice discovers a book in an unrecognisable language that turns out to be written inversely and readable in a mirror.

For adults learning a second language, Neville said: 'Teach grammatical rules implicitly, without any semantics at all, like with jabberwocky. Get them to listen to jabberwocky, like a child does.'

The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders of the National Institutes of Health supported the research and the study was published in the May 8 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience.
