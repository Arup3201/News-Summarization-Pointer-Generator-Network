If you want to join the likes of Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr and Mother Teresa in having a Nobel Peace Prize it's easy - you just need £50,000 in your back pocket.

A lost prize which surfaced in a South American pawn shop is going under the hammer, becoming only the second ever to be auctioned.

The 23-carat solid gold medal was awarded to Argentina's foreign minister in 1936 for his role ending a brutal South American war which killed 100,000 people.

After he died in 1959, however, the prize's whereabouts were unknown for decades.

Priceless: This Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to Argentinia's foreign minister in 1936, was thought to have been lost but will be auctioned later this month - 20 years after it surfaced in a South American pawn shop

Now it has emerged the medal was traded in at a pawn shop in South America 20 years ago.

Whoever brought the prize to the shop may have had no idea of its true value, instead trading the 222.4g piece for the value of its gold.

Historic: The award was given to Carlos Saavedra Lamas, its first Latin American recipient, in 1936

Instead of revealing it, the pawnbroker sold it to a U.S. dealer who he had done business with before.

He took it back to his home country and sold it to another dealer, who then sold it to the Charles A Wharton collection - a pseudonym for a wealthy collector who died more than 10 years ago.

The man's descendants have now decided to sell it, meaning its history can be revealed.

The solid gold medal will be auctioned in Baltimore by New York's Stack's Bowers Galleries on March 27 and the value of its gold alone is said to be $9,168 (£5,521).

John Kraljevich, a specialist in historical medals and a consultant to Stack's Bowers, told MailOnline: 'The words Nobel Peace Prize are only engraved in French on the edge so they might not have known what they had and thought "oh, it's just another gold medal".

'There are an awful lot of gold medals in the world and most of them are only worth the value of their bullion.

'The dealer who bought it from South America is protecting his source and won't tell us where the shop was, something that's quite common in the antiques and coin world.

'Had the shop owner not recognized that it
 might be worth more to somebody than just the value of the bullion ... 
it would have been melted and thrown in with broken gold earrings.'

The medal has a tiny file mark on the edge, which Mr Kraljevich said was a sign someone had tried to work out how pure the gold was in case it was melted down.

He added: 'I would say it's more famous than an 
Olympic gold medal.

'When you look at the list of past
 recipients, they're obviously some of the most important people to walk
 the face of the globe in the last 100-plus years.

'This was definitely special. What struck me was how heavy it is - it's almost half a pound of gold so it has a significant heft to it in your hand. It's very sculptural.'

Detail: The back of the gold medal, first awarded in 1901, features three men in a fraternal bond with the Latin inscription: 'Pro pace et fraternitate gentium' ('For the peace and brotherhood of men')

Legacy: The front of the medal features the Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the prize

The Nobel Peace Prize was one of five 
created by the Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who invented 
dynamite, and was first awarded in 1901.

Its most famous recipients have included Martin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa.

The other prizes are for chemistry, physics, medicine and literature.

'I can't think of many public 
collections that have a Nobel Prize, never mind a Nobel Peace Prize 
medal,' said Ute Wartenberg, executive director of the American 
Numismatic Society.

'This was definitely special. What struck me was how heavy it is - it's almost half a pound of gold so it has a significant heft to it in your hand. It's very sculptural.'

'This is an incredible rarity.'

Other Nobel awards have sold at auction, but only one other Peace Prize is known to have come under the hammer.

The 1903 medal awarded to Sir William Cremer, the Liberal MP who was a champion of free speech and created Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park through an Act of Parliament, sold for £11,550 ($16,748) in 1985 at Sotheby's.

The 1936 prize is expect to fetch at least $50,000 to $100,000 (£30,106 to £60,212).

The Charles A Wharton collection also owned a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, one of the world's most prestigious journalism and arts awards.

It will be sold alongside the Nobel Peace Prize at the same auction - becoming the first gold Pulitzer medal ever to go under the hammer.

The 14-carat gold medallion was presented to the newspaper New York World-Telegram in 1933 for a series of articles exposing scam lottery schemes.

The newspaper also won the award for stories on veterans' relief, real estate bonds and a campaign urging voters in New York to vote for Democrat Joseph V McKee by 'writing in' his name despite the fact he did not appear on the ballot.

Founded when the New York World and Evening Telegram merged two years earlier, the newspaper only survived for three more decades and was merged into a string of unsuccessful titles in 1966.

The Pulitzer prize is expected to fetch between $15,000 and $30,000 (£9,033 and £18,066). The public service award is the only category of the prize to be awarded a gold medal. All the others receive monetary awards.

Rare: The only other Nobel Peace Prize ever to be auctioned was given to the pacifist and trade unionist Sir William Cremer (pictured) in 1903. He was its first solo recipient and helped found Speakers' Corner in London

Sale: The same collector owned this Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, which will be the first ever auctioned

War: The winner of the 1936 prize helped to end the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay which broke out over several land disputes and killed 100,000 men. Pictured: Soldiers drinking in Paraguay

Held: Some of the 7,000 Paraguayan prisoners captured in March 1935 by Bolivian forces

While Europe was distracted by Nazi Germany in the 1930s, a brutal war was killing tens of thousands of people in South America.

Fought between Bolivia and Paraguay, the Chaco War lasted from 1933 to 1935 over a 100,000 square mile wilderness and was the culmination of tensions which had lasted several decades.

Clashes: Residents of La Paz in Bolivia gather to demonstrate against Paraguay in 1932

When the War of the Pacific ended in 1884, Chile defeated Bolivia and annexed Bolivia's coast, leaving its citizens landlocked and frustrated.

So Bolivia started encroaching onto Paraguay, which initiated a string of clashes in December 1928 - clashes which led to a full-scale war despite the efforts of the United States.

A truce was finally arranged on June 12, 
1935, in a peace conference which included Argentina, 
Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, and the United States.

It allowed Paraguay to have clear ownership of most of 
the disputed region, but Bolivia was given a corridor to the Paraguay 
River and a port, Puerto Casado.

Most of the credit went to Argentina's foreign minister Carlos Saavedra Lamas, who was the key figure behind the truce.

He became the first person from outside Western Europe and the U.S. to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

He was also crucial to Argentina joining the League of Nations in 1932.

In his mid-fifties when he won the prestigious award, he came from landed gentry and gained a PhD in law before becoming a professor of constitutional law.

He won his first elected post aged 30 and later became the Minister of Justice and Minister of Education before heading the country's foreign affairs for six years.

Why the medal left his family and ended up in a pawn shop is a mystery.

Mr Kraljevich told MailOnline: 'He had a son, and his son had a son - but after that the trail goes cold. The grandson died at some time in the '70s.

'It may have ended up in some distant part of the family where they didn't care about it or maybe they just needed the money.

'It does seem odd but sometimes people just don't care about their family history that much.'
