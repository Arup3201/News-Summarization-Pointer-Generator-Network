The National Portrait Gallery has a new exhibition of police mug shots with a difference - they are all criminal suffragettes and one of them bears a remarkable resemblance to the Princess Royal.

Chopper-wielding Canadian Mary Raleigh Richardson – for she is the royal doppelganger – attacked The Toilet of Venus ( better known as The Rokeby Venus) by Diego Velázquez.

She joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), led by Emmeline Pankhurst. On March 10, 1914 she entered the National Gallery in London and slashed the Rokeby Venus with a chopper that she had smuggled into the gallery.

Which one is which? The chopper-wielding vandal Mary Richardson and the horse-riding Princess Royal

Always on for publicity, she had even drafted a press release: ‘I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history.’

Richardson later became the head of the women's section of the British Union of Fascists led by Sir Oswald Mosley.

Formed in 1903, the WSPU's first scandal occurred on January 17, 1908, when a group of suffragettes chained themselves to the railings of 10 Downing Street and were arrested.

In 1912 the suffragettes started a campaign of window smashing and one of the biggest smashers was Evelyn Manesta and she was arrested and sent to Holloway Prison. On her relase she continued her nefarious activities and in March 1914, as part of a concerted attack on art, she and Lillian Forrester attacked paintings of classically ‘beautiful’ women in the Manchester Art Museum.

Look for the woman: 1 - Margaret Scott, 2 - Olive Leared (née Hockin), 3 - Margaret McFarlane, 4 - Mary Wyan (Mary Ellen Taylor), 5 - Annie Bell, 6 - Jane Short, 7 - Gertrude Mary Ansell, 8 - Maud Brindley, 9 - Verity Oates, 10 - Evelyn Manesta

The woman in the case: 11 - Mary Raleigh Richardson, 12 - Lilian Lenton, 13 - Kitty Marion (Katherina Maria Schafer), 14 -Lillian Forrester, 15 - Miss Johansen, 16 - Clara Giveen, 17 - Jennie Baines, 18 - Miriam Pratt

In early 1913, Lilian Lenton and Olive Wharry began a series of arson attacks in London, and Lenton was arrested in February 1913 on suspicion of having set fire to the Tea House at Kew Gardens. Sent to Holloway, Lenton began a hunger strike that lasted for two days before she was force fed. The force feeding caused her to fall ill when food entered her lungs. She was quickly and quietly released.

The Home Secretary, Reginald McKenna, denied that she had been force fed and that her illness was actually caused by her hunger strike.

Lilian Lenton died in October 1972. She never married.

The Government rushed through its 'Cat and Mouse Act' in April 1913, which allowed for the release of hunger-striking suffragette 'mice' to regain their health, when the security forces could re-arrest them.

Clara Giveen (left) was sentenced to three years' penal servitude for setting fire to the grandstand at Hurst Park; Kitty Marion (right) was an actress in pantomimes and became a militant suffragette when faced with the casting couch. She was sentenced to one month's hard labour for breaking a window in the Newcastle Post Office during a visit by Lloyd George
