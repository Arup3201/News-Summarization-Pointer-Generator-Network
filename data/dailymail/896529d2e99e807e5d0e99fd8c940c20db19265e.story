Susan Wilson died in her hospital bed of a massive heart attack after suffering severe internal bleeding

A grandmother bled to death in the 16 hours after her operation because staff were too busy to check on her condition.

Susan Wilson was admitted to Nottingham's Queens Medical Centre to have her gallbladder removed in October 2012.

The 59-year-old spent time on a high dependency unit before being moved to another ward where observations should have been carried out on a four-hour basis.

But a nurse at the hospital failed to carry out the basic checks and the retired care worker suffered a massive heart attack as a result of severe bleeding the day after surgery.

It was only when the nurse checked on Ms Wilson at the end of his shift that he discovered her lifeless, dead in her hospital bed.

Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust has now paid Ms Wilson's family a five-figure sum in an out-of-court settlement after bosses admitted 'failing its basic duties of care'.

An inquest at Nottingham Coroner’s Court last November was told the mother-of-one could have been lying dead on the hospital ward for several hours.

A nurse failed to carry out observations on her for 16 hours and only discovered something was wrong when she was already dead.

Mrs Wilson’s partner Stuart Clift, 67, said: 'The hospital has agreed they were in the wrong and that they didn’t provide the care they should have done.

'I feel that to some extent, justice has been done but obviously there is no price you can put on anybody’s life, especially Susan’s.

'The circumstances of her death left me struggling to stay in the place we were living and I had a feeling of desolation after her death.'

Mr Clift, who still lives in Larkhill Village, Nottinghamshire, added: 'We had moved to Larkhill for our retirement and thought we’d be there for 10 to 20 years.

'I never expected Susan would die within three years.'

Ms Wilson had decided to go ahead with the operation to deal with a painful gallbladder and was aware of the risks because of an existing heart problem.

After the surgery, she spent time on a high dependency unit before being moved to Ward E18, where nursing observations should have been carried out.

Staff nurse Neil Bailey told last year’s inquest he was too busy on his shift to check on Ms Wilson and admitted her requirements were overlooked.

Giving evidence, he said: 'At no point did I make a conscious decision not to attend to Susan.

'When I handed over my patients (at the end of my shift), I became aware I had entirely overlooked Susan’s needs and requirements and went to check her and it was at that time I discovered no signs of life.'

The inquest heard how staffing concerns had been previously raised on the E18 ward, where Ms Wilson died.

Mr Bailey had been caring for ten of the 28 patients on the ward at the time.

Nottingham Deputy Coroner Heidi Connor criticised the treatment and described the situation as 'shocking'.

The 59-year-old was admitted to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre to have her gallbladder removed in October 2012. But after being moved back to the ward following surgery Ms Wilson the nurse in charge of her care failed to make the standard four-hour checks, discovering her dead in bed at the end of his 16-hour shift

Recording a narrative verdict the coroner said staffing was a national crisis that needed to be addressed.

She said: 'It goes without saying this is something the trust needs to prioritise to avoid tragedies like the one we have heard about today.

'To miss or delay one observation is one thing but to have no observations in an entire 12-hour shift and no notes at all is nothing short of shocking.

'It’s clear he (Mr Bailey) felt overwhelmed and I have some sympathy in that respect.

'Staff Nurse Bailey failed to provide the medical attention Susan needed.'

Peter Homa, chief executive of 
Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We reiterate our 
sincere and unreserved apologies to the family for failing our basic 
duties of care and letting Ms Wilson and them down.

'I feel that to some extent, justice has 
been done but obviously there is no price you can put on anybody’s life,
 especially Susan’s'

'Whilst no amount of money can undo the distress the family have experienced as a result of this tragic case or compensate for their loss, we hope the settlement provides some financial security for the future.'

The family received the five-figure sum compensation after taking their case to clinical negligence lawyers Slater and Gordon.

Solicitor Paul Sankey, who represented Mrs Wilson’s family, said: 'Evidence heard at the inquest raised grave concerns about the quality of care Susan received and the processes that were in place at the Queen’s Medical Centre.

'It is clear that Susan’s tragic death was wholly avoidable. It is simply not acceptable that she was left to bleed to death on a hospital ward and it is important those responsible were held to account.

'Despite their loss, Susan’s family have been determined to remember her as the popular, happy, much-loved woman that she was.

'They now hope that important lessons are learned from the events that led to her death and that this will prevent other families suffering a similar tragedy in the future.'

Mr Clift said Susan, who had one son, Sean, 41, had been 'well-liked' by everyone she met.

He added: 'She was an active person and was very bubbly and gregarious.

'She would always talk to people before they had to talk to her. She is missed by all her family and friends.'
