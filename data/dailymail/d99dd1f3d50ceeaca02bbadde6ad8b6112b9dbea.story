These dramatic pictures show the extent of the devastation caused after a suspected gas leak caused an explosion that left an elderly man fighting for his life and his wife in hospital.

Terrified neighbours reported hearing an 'almighty bang' and said that the elderly couple were trapped beneath rubble after the incident at around 5.45am this morning.

The couple, named locally as Robin Cunningham, 77, and his wife Marrianne, 74, were left trapped in their home after the blast in the kitchen area of the house, in Callander, near Stirling, Perthshire.

It is believed the explosion was triggered as Mr Cunningham made his wife a cup of tea.

Twenty local firemen arrived on the 
scene within six minutes of the incident at around 5.45am this morning. 
They took just 10 minutes to rescue the couple.

A 74-year-old woman with minor injuries was taken to Forth Valley Royal Infirmary and a 77-year-old man was taken by air ambulance to the Southern General in Glasgow.

His condition was described as 'serious but stable', but a hospital spokeswoman has since said he is 'stable' - suggesting a slight improvement in his condition. He is expected to remain in hospital over the coming days.

Neighbour Alistair Allan, who lives across the road, told STV News: 'We were all woken up at 6.30am by this almighty bang. 

'I looked out the window and the house across the road was on fire. I ran across and the elderly gentleman was under rubble, I think in the kitchen, and his wife was in another part of the house.

'I could hear her calling out for help. She was saying 'I can't take it any more'. 

The house was flattened after the explosion, which is thought to have been triggered as Mr Cunningham made his wife a cup of tea

Twenty local firemen arrived on the scene to rescue the trapped couple, whose home has now been flattened

'The firefighters were there very quickly. They got the woman out through a window and I think the man was out after about 15 or 20 minutes.

'My daughter came in last night about 8.30pm and said there was a strong smell of gas in the street but we didn't think anything of it at the time.'

He was one of the first people on the scene, answering calls for help from inside the collapsed house.

Mr
Allan said: 'I totally couldn't believe it, to be honest. It's a gas 
explosion, I take it, so there is no wonder there is the devastation 
that there is here.

'(They)
were shouting for help - "Get me out" and "I can't take this any 
longer, get me out, get me out" - but there was no doubt we had to leave
it to the fire services to get them out.'

Bob Palmer, 80, who lives at the entrance of the street, said: 'When I saw the wreckage it is a wonder anyone got out alive.

'My wife an I both jumped out our skin when we heard the bang.

The property was obliterated following the early morning incident. The pair were taken to different hospitals by the emergency services

One neighbour claimed his daughter had smelt gas last night, and believed this had caused the explosion

Nine houses nearby have been evacuated and Stirling Council has set up a rest centre in the town

'It was a real cracker of a bang. The emergency services were here very quickly but we just couldn't believe it.

'There was no fire and you couldn't see any smoke, but the house had just been flattened.

'They always seemed like a really nice couple, just kept themselves to themselves'.

Valerie Adie, who lives nearby, said: 'The explosion was very, very loud, it shook the entire house.

'At first I thought it could have been some kind of earthquake. I just hope the couple are ok'.

Claire Luti, said: 'I live at the other end of town so I didn't hear the explosion, but I heard the helicopter that was sent to take them (the man) to hospital.

'They are an elderly couple in their 70s who are quite well known in the town.'

Nine houses in Murdiston Avenue and nearby Aveland Road have been evacuated and Stirling Council has set up a rest centre in the town.

Chief Inspector Russell Penman, of Central Scotland Police, said: 'We suspect it was a gas leak that has caused this damage, the house has been demolished by the explosion.

'The elderly male was trapped under some of the rubble and the female was in the bedroom.

'The fire service did an excellent job of getting the man out.

'We got the gas turned off and evacuated the near by houses before closing off the street. It took about 30 minutes to get all the residents clear.

'Scotland Gas Networks are in attendance and working with us.'
