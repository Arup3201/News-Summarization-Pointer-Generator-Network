'Jihadist hearts are bleeding': Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri (pictured) has called on militant rebel factions seeking to overthrow President Assad in Syria to stop fighting each other

An Al Qaeda leader has called on militant rebel factions in Syria to stop fighting each other and set up a judicial committee to sort out their differences, according to an audio recording released on Islamist websites.

The small but powerful Al Qaeda-linked Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has been caught up in clashes with other Islamist insurgents in recent weeks, often triggered by disputes over authority and territory.

In a five-minute recording, Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri said: 'Our hearts and the hearts of the (Muslim) nation, which hangs its hopes on you, have bled for the infighting that has spread between the ranks of those waging jihad for Islam.

'We call on all our brothers in all the jihadist groups... to work towards ending this sedition, which will lead to only God knows what.'

The recording emerged as international peace talks on Syria looked close to collapse yesterday after a furious clash over President Assad's future.

Reuters news agency was unable independently to confirm the authenticity of the recording, but the voice bore a clear resemblance to that of Zawahri.

The insurgent groups fighting ISIL range from relatively secular moderates to Islamists, including the Al Qaeda-aligned Jabhat al-Nusra, in the worst rebel-on-rebel violence since Syria's conflict began in March 2011.

In April, the head of ISIL, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi tried to merge ISIL with Jabhat al-Nusra, defying orders from Zawahri and causing a rift.

The fighting since the start of January has killed more than 1,000 people, according to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitors.

The fissures within rebel ranks have helped President Bashar al-Assad's forces claw back territory around the northern commercial hub of Aleppo.

About 130,000 people have been killed and a quarter of Syrians driven from their homes in the civil war, which began with peaceful protests against 40 years of Assad family rule and has descended into a sectarian conflict, with the opposing sides armed and funded by Sunni Arab states and Shi'ite Iran.

High-level mediating has yielded little so far, but Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN mediator who is meeting separately today with each Syrian delegation, said there are signs they might be willing to bend on humanitarian aid, ceasefires and prisoner exchanges.

Amid hostile exchanges at the peace talks
 in Switzerland, Syria’s government ridiculed demands by opposition 
leaders and their Western backers including Britain for Assad to stand 
down, saying it would never happen.

At another Swiss venue, the World Economic Forum in Davos, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called today for a new election in Syria, saying his nation would respect the results.

With renewed fighting in large parts 
of Syria, the opposition insisted the country’s leader lost his 
legitimacy when he crushed a once-peaceful protest movement.

But foreign minister Walid al-Moallem said it was terrorists and foreign meddling that had ripped his country apart.

He clashed with UN chief Ban Ki-Moon, who asked five times for him to stop speaking and leave the podium in Montreux.

Mr al-Moallem told the UN Secretary-General: ‘You live in New York. I live in Syria. I have the right to give the Syrian version.’

US Secretary of State John Kerry intervened, saying: ‘The right to lead a country does not come from torture, nor barrel bombs, nor Scud missiles.’

Yesterday’s session was intended to pave the way for Syria’s government and main opposition, the National Coalition, to sit down face-to-face in Geneva tomorrow for the first time since the conflict began in 2011.
