Uh-oh!

The Campbell Soup company announced that they are recalling 80 cases of soup after the cans which were labeled as containing chicken broth actually held SpaghettiOs with meatballs.

The 1,920 cans were mislabeled as Swanson 100% Natural Chicken Broth, though they actually contained pasta and meatballs.

Campbell's Soup recalled 80 cases of Swanson's 100% Natural Chicken Broth after it was discovered that they actually contained SpaghettiOs

The company pulled the products as soon as consumers started to report the mistake.

'In an abundance of caution, Campbell is retrieving the 80 cases of 
canned pasta labeled as Swanson 100% Natural Chicken Broth from the 
market,' the company published on its website. 'This recall does not affect 
any other Campbell products.'

The total amount of food recalled amounts to 1,740 pounds of pasta and meat, NBC News reported.

Aside from consumers not getting what they purchased, the mislabeled cans pose a potential health threat to the uniformed buyers.

Unlike the pasta with chicken brother, SpaghettiOs with meatballs contain allergens such as wheat, milk, and soy, The Huffington Post reported.

Consumers were dismayed to find SpaghettiOs in what they thought were cans of chicken broth. The mislabeled cans contained allergens including wheat, milk, and soy

The mislabeled food was made in Paris, Texas and then shipped to distribution center that ships the product around the country, according to the website.

Amongst the states with mislabeled cans are Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas.

Though two consumers reported this mistake before Campbell's Soup publicly recalled the cans, according to the Department of Agriculture, the company has not gotten any reports of consumers suffering an allergic reaction, NBC News reported.

Campbell's Soup has asked that any consumers who do receive these mislabeled cans return them to stores for a full refund, according to The Huffington Post.

News of this mishap came right after the company's stock closed at $43.19 at the end of the week.

Campbells, who are the largest manufacturer of soup in the world, just announced a fourth-quarter earning loss leading up to these events, according to NJ.com.
