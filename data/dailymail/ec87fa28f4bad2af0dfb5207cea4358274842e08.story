The son: Andrew Cane is being sought in connection with the death of a his 63-year-old mother Linda

Police are on the hunt for a 30-year-old man suspected of murdering his mother in her home.

The body of Linda Sheard, 63, was discovered by members of her family in her home near Brixington, Exmouth last night.

Her son Andrew Cane, who had recently moved in with her, is being sought by police in connection with her death.

A blue Honda Civic, believed to have been used by Cane, was found abandoned next to the A4 near Bristol today. It had been abandoned next to the A4, Devon and Cornwall Police said.

A police spokesman said Cane could be ‘anywhere in the country’.

Divorcee Linda was found dead in her £250,000 property on Wednesday evening just after 7pm.

It is understood that her son moved into her home some months ago and worked as a roofer at the same Exmouth firm where Mrs Sheard had worked for a number of years.

A neighbour in the small 
cul-de-sac where Mrs Sheard has lived for the past six years described 
Cane as a 'quiet bloke who never seemed much trouble'.

The neighbour also said he knew Andrew's dad, Michael Cane ‘an ex-copper’.

Mrs Sheard had previously lived in Blandford Forum, Dorset, before moving to Exeter and bought her home in Exmouth in 2006.
