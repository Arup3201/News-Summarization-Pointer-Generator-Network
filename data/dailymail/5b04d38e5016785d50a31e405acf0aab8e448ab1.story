Taxi from hell: Former Uber driver Maxime Fohounhedo (pictured) is due in Chicago court on Tuesday to face charges of sexual assault after allegedly raping a 22-year-old passenger last month 

A former Uber driver is due in court today after allegedly raping a 22-year-old passenger last month.

The unidentified woman says driver Maxime Fohounhedo picked her up on November 16 and that she later woke up to him on top of her in an unfamiliar apartment.

The 30-year-old driver faces charges of  sexual assault and criminal sexual abuse. 

Fohounhedo is the latest in a string of sex assault claims against Uber drivers that have been plaguing the taxi app company recently.

The victim was finishing a night of partying with her co-workers when she ordered an Uber X driver around 3am to take her home a bar in Chicago's North River neighborhood, according to a police report obtained byDNAinfo. 

About 20 minutes into the ride, Fohounhedo allegedly asked her to come sit in the front seat since he was unfamiliar with the area. 

When they reached the area of Western and Lawrence Avenues, the victim says the driver started to assault her and that she blacked out. 

Later, she recalls waking up in a residence on the 2600 block of West Lawrence Avenue with Fohounhedo on top of her. 

After he was done raping her, she says he took her home in the same black car and that she texted a friend about the incident back at home before falling asleep.

'I was just sexually assaulted by my Uber driver and I'm supberb (sic) drunk, but I need someone to remind me to follow through to make sure this never happens again,' she wrote to the friend, according to the report. 

The victim was later treated at Swedish Covenant Hospital. 

Safe? The ride sharing app has been criticized by regular taxi unions who claim they don't perform thorough background checks on drivers 

Though Uber keeps a record of their drivers' routes, it took more than a month to arrest Fohounhedo for the crime. 

He was fired from the company in December, in the wake of the allegations. 

In a statement issued on December 9, an Uber spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with the victim and her family. We immediately removed the driver from the Uber platform when we learned of the incident, and are cooperating with the Chicago Police Department.' 

Fohounhedo is just one of several Uber drivers who have been accused of sexual assault since the app was launched in the U.S. in 2011. Another woman in Chicago sued the company earlier this year after her driver allegedly locked her in the car and groped her breast, legs and groin before she escaped. 

Taxi cab union have been critiquing ride-sharing service like Uber and competitor Lyft for their background checks, claiming they aren't as thorough as typical cab services.
