A couple who broadcast the birth of their daughter over the internet have become the victims of a vicious campaign of abuse.

Jonathan and Anna Saccone-Joly, from Cork, Ireland,  were subjected to cruel comments after they posted the video on the internet earlier this month, with one viewer saying they hoped their baby 'would be stillborn'.

Among the other hurtful messages left by internet trolls were 'horrible' comments from people saying they hoped the expectant mother would suffer a miscarriage.

they posted a video on the internet showing the birth of their baby

The Cork-based couple have had 150,000 hits since they posted a video of the birth of their daughter Emilia Thomasina online earlier this month.

Jonathan and Anna have been filming their show, The SacconeJolys, daily for two years now, and said the birth of their daughter was the next step in their life story.

They film every morning to produce a roughly half-hour episode of the show each day and though the birth of their daughter wasn't broadcast live, the 20-minute film was edited into the next day's episode.

It shows Mrs Saccone-Joly in her private room at the hospital texting friends during the labour.

She is then seen inhaling gas and air while describing how she is 'in a lot of pain'.

The camera focuses on Mrs Saccone-Joly during the birth while she holds her husband's hand.

Their decision to film the birth, however, prompted a backlash of nasty comments from online viewers.

'Some of the comments were horrible,' said Mr Saccone-Joly. 'We told our viewers in advance that we were going to film our daughter's birth. People said they were hoping we would have a miscarriage or that our baby would be stillborn.

'Emilia had to be induced so people were saying it was so pathetic that Anna couldn't push her baby out.

'One Irish TV show slated us last week saying it was “disgusting”,' he added. 'It's extremely hurtful but you have to grow a thick skin as the majority of our viewers love us.'

Mr Saccone-Joly said the couple were simply letting people share in their joy and didn't intend to offend anyone with the 'discreet' footage.

'There was nothing outrageous about it,' said Mr Saccone-Joly. 'There is no blood or anything like that, it's all done discreetly.'

The couple have a deal with a US distribution network and have often courted controversy with the broadcast of their engagement and marriage and other daily aspects of their lives over the internet.

Mr Saccone-Joly said they were shrugging off the nasty comments and getting on with their lives saying: 'She (Anna) is busy with the baby, we both are and we are working together under one roof with getting our show done so we help each other out.'
