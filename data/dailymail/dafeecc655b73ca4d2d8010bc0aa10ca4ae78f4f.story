Sleepy or exhausted drivers are in twenty-one percent of deadly car crashes - more so than previously reported, a November study discovered.

The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety said in a study released this month that researchers looked at 14,268 car crashes that took place for 2009 to 2013 that involved a car being towed.

It said 'Results showed that an estimated 6% of all crashes in which a vehicle was towed from the scene, 7% of crashes in which a person received treatment for injuries sustained in the crash, 13% of crashes in which a person was hospitalized, and 21% of crashes in which a person was killed involved a drowsy driver.  

Danger: The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety says sleepy or exhausted drivers are in twenty-one percent of deadly car crashes

'If these proportions are applied to all reported crashes nationwide, results suggest that an average of 328,000 crashes annually, including 109,000 crashes that result in injuries and 6,400 fatal crashes, involve a drowsy driver.'

The foundation points out 'A previous study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that 7% of all crashes in which a vehicle was towed from the scene, 13% of crashes in which a person was hospitalized, and 17% of fatal crashes involved a drowsy driver in years 1999 – 2008.'

AAA Foundation President and CEO Peter Kissinger said in a Monday release 'This new research further confirms that drowsy driving is a serious traffic safety problem. Unfortunately, drivers often underestimate this risk and overestimate their ability to combat drowsiness behind the wheel.'

Fatal: The study also projected sleepy drivers are in 6,400 deadly car crashes across the country each year

'Despite the fact that 95 percent of Americans deem it "unacceptable" to drive when they are so tired that they have a hard time keeping their eyes open, more than 28 percent admit to doing so in the last month,' he added. 'Like other impairments, driving while drowsy is not without risk.'

The Monday release highlighted older findings 'that young adult drivers, ages 19-24, are the most likely to admit to driving while drowsy, with 33 percent reporting doing so in the last month. In contrast, the oldest drivers (ages 75+) and the youngest (ages 16-18) were the least likely to report the same offense.'

The foundation said in the release it 'is highlighting the risks of drowsy driving in support of the National Sleep Foundation’s Drowsy Driving Prevention Week®, which runs November 2-9.'
