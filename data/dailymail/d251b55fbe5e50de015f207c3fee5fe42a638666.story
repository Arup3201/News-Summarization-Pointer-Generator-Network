Labour will hit families with billions more in taxes and borrowing if it wins the election, George Osborne will warn today.

The Chancellor will today publish a ‘dossier’ on Labour’s spending commitments for 2015/6. Sources say it will show Labour will run up a black hole of ‘many billions of pounds’ within months of taking office.

And David Cameron yesterday said the recovery was ‘at risk from politicians who learned nothing from the last five years and who would borrow, spend and tax all over again, taking us right back to square one’.

Today Mr Miliband will hit back at the launch of Labour’s election campaign in Manchester.

‘The Tories damaged the NHS in five years,’ he will say. ‘Give them five more and the NHS as we know it won’t be there.’

But former Labour welfare minister Frank Field yesterday said his leader was ‘scared to tell the truth’ about the NHS.

Mr Field, who is campaigning for a one per cent rise in National Insurance to head off a looming financial crisis in the NHS, went on to say that Mr Miliband was in denial about the scale of the challenge, and that neither Labour nor the Tories had produced a credible plan to avert ‘catastrophe’.

Labour activists have also been ordered to knock on four million doors during the campaign – twice as many as in 2010. And Mr Miliband will pledge to hold weekly ‘People’s Question Times’ in offices and factories across Britain.

Today Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to pledge that he will hold weekly 'People's Question Times every week in the lead up to the election 

Speaking just 48 hours after Labour launched a controversial poster attacking Tory spending plans, Mr Miliband will say: ‘We will win this election, not by buying up thousands of poster sites, but by having millions of conversations.’

In a clear sign that the election campaign is underway, Mr Osborne will hold an extraordinary joint press conference with Theresa May, William Hague, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Culture Secretary Sajid Javid to attack Labour’s spending plans on the day of Mr Miliband’s election launch.

A Tory source said the study of Labour’s plans, which has taken months to compile, has revealed a huge black hole.

The source said: ‘When we took office four and a half years ago, we were left a note by the Labour Party saying simply: “There’s no money left”.

‘The evidence we will produce shows that Labour have not demonstrated the fiscal discipline or economic competence that earns an opposition the credibility to form a government. 

'The chaos of unfunded spending promises, higher taxes and more borrowing offered by Labour is a risk to economic recovery.’

Nick Clegg will also attempt to get his voice heard, by telling voters that a vote for the Liberal Democrats provides the greatest prospect of another coalition government.

The Lib Dem leader will describe Labour as a ‘clear and present danger’ to the economy. But he will also attack the Tories for taking an ‘ideological’ approach to spending cuts.
