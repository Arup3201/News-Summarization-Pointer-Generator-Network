It's certainly one way to race ahead in the festive ratings battle.

The BBC has revealed that it will screen its controversial Top Gear special over Christmas – despite receiving a fresh complaint from Argentina’s ambassador.

The episode sparked fury when it was filmed in the South American country earlier this year, with locals taking offence at the H982 FKL number plate on a Porsche driven by Jeremy Clarkson, believing it was a reference to the 1982 Falklands conflict.

Clarkson, 54, denied the plate was chosen deliberately and claimed that he and his fellow presenters were forced to hide under their beds and flee Argentina after an angry mob searched their hotel and tried to attack them.

But in a show of defiance that risks escalating the row even further, the corporation last night insisted the provocative episode will sit at the heart of its festive programming – alongside more traditional staples such as Doctor Who, Strictly Come Dancing and the last ever episodes of Miranda.

There will also be a string of one-off dramas, including an adaptation of Roald Dahl’s classic Esio Trot starring Dustin Hoffman and Judi Dench.

But it is the Top Gear special that will undoubtedly generate the most discussion. It shows Clarkson and his fellow presenters Richard Hammond and James May driving three V8 sports cars 1,600 miles through Patagonia in southern Argentina.

The announcement of the Christmas line-up came on the same day that Argentina’s ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, wrote to the BBC Trust expressing ‘discontent’ with how the number plate fiasco was handled.

She claimed Clarkson’s behaviour ‘fell well below BBC’s editorial values and standards’ and called for a fresh investigation.

And last night, Top Gear risked fresh controversy after a yellow Ford Raptor pick-up truck apparently driven by Clarkson was spotted in Canada without registration plates on the front or rear.

But a BBC spokesman insisted the team had complied with local law, saying: ‘As a brand new vehicle, the car was being driven with a temporary operating permit which was displayed in the window.’

The programme has been embroiled in a string of controversies over the years, including accusations of racism after Clarkson apparently mumbled the word n***** during an outtake and referred to an Asian man as a ‘slope’ during a Burma special.

In 2011, Hammond prompted a complaint by the Mexican ambassador after he suggested a Mexican car would be ‘lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight’.

In an interview with the Radio Times yesterday, the 44-year-old refused to say whether the BBC have since warned the Top Gear team to be more careful.

But he said: ‘In society as a whole, we love to be offended and have a scapegoat.

‘But at Top Gear we’re the first to put our hands up and say we pitched it wrong. We have apologised.

‘We’re not in the business of genuinely upsetting or offending anyone. We’re in the business of entertainment, and if it fails to entertain, it’s wrong. If the public says we stepped over the line, then we have.'
