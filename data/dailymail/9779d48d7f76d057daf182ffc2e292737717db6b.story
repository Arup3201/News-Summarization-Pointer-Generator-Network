An adult film star known as the 'Queen of Clown Porn' has died after a public battle with breast cancer, aged just 30.

Hollie Stevens, from San Francisco, California, died while holding her husband's hand last Tuesday after the cancer spread to her bones, liver and brain.

Stevens, who married just last month, had performed in more than 170 films and was nominated for 
industry awards. She was also a pioneer of the niche genre, clown porn.

Passed: Porn star Hollie Stevens has died aged 30 after a 18-month battle with cancer that spread from her breast to her bones, ribs, liver and brain. She was best known for her work in clown porn

But before her death, she said she hoped to be remembered as a good wife and friend rather than for her professional accomplishments.

'I hope people know I’m always myself. I take pride in what others think may be weird about me!' she said, BoingBoing.net reported.

'I'd also want people to know what I love most, what what makes me happy, is being a friend and a wife. That's what I would want them to know and remember.'

She was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast 
cancer last Spring and, after undergoing several months of chemotherapy,
had her left breast removed.

Reports after her diagnosis noted 
that she had found a lump in her breast but put off seeking treatment as
she did not have health insurance.

'I noticed it and paid attention to it, but going to the doctor is hard when you don't have insurance,' she had said.

Her friends, family and fans rallied around her, raising $16,000 for her medical bills.

'I cannot believe how many people care, how good my fans are, and how 
much complete strangers have helped me,' she said of the donations. 'This is unreal. Not everyone 
hates clowns after all!'

Among those heading the 
fundraising campaign was dominatrix January Seraph, who asked 
clients to donate money in return for extra time in sessions with her.

Wedding: Stevens married comedian and actor Eric Cash in hospital just weeks before her death

Sense of fun: Her tweets in the days before her death remain upbeat and good humoured

On her blog site 
'missjanuary.com', Ms Seraph offered to provide half-an-hour extra 
bondage time to any client who made a donation of $50 towards The
Hollie Stevens Medical Fund.

In July 2011, she said she was 
encouraging people to help Hollie out because her friend would never 
take the initiative.

She said: 'She's
too proud to ask for help herself, so myself and her other great 
friends are being pushy and helping her out whether she likes it or not.

'Show Hollie that she's loved and appreciated in her time of need. Because no one should feel alone when they are ill.'

But in December 2011, the cancer was found to have spread to her bones.

In March, a spot was 
identified in the actor's leg and she underwent an operation in an attempt to strengthen her leg and hip.

Battle: Stevens initially put off having a lump checked as she did not have health insurance. her family, friends and fans raised $16,000 for her medical bills

Cancerous cells were also found in her liver and several new tumours were discovered on and near the initial site.

She lost her battle on Tuesday July 3 in San Fransisco as she held the hand of her husband, comedian and actor Eric Cash, whom she married in hospital in June.

She had been regularly updating her fans on Twitter and Facebook with snaps taken from inside the hospital, where she appeared to remain upbeat and good humoured.

Images show her hooked up to drips and undergoing blood transfusions, while other messages noted how much she missed her new husband.

As well as working as a porn star, comedian and actress, Stevens also enjoyed painting and exhibited works in the Hyena Gallery in Burbank, SF Weekly reported.
