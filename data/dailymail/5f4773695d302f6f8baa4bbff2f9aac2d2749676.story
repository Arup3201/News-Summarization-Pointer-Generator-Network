In 1997, the towers reached international
 fame as Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in the blockbuster film 'Men in 
Black' blew up the top of the towers, which in the movie were two alien 
spaceships. They were also seen in the 2010 hit 'Iron Man 2'

They were designed as sleek, space-age visions of the future: three towers topped by flying-saucer-like platforms, and a pavilion of pillars with a suspended, shimmering roof that was billed as the "Tent of Tomorrow."

Now the structures are abandoned relics, with rusted beams, faded paint and cracked concrete.

The two space-age looking towers with the New York State Pavilion in front are crumbling remnants of the 1964 World's Fair. The giant metal globe to the right, the Unisphere, has been restored

As the fair's 50th anniversary approaches
 later this month, the remains of the New York State Pavilion are 
getting renewed attention, from preservationists who believe they should
 be restored, and from critics who see them as hulking eyesores that 
should be torn down. Neither option would come cheap: an estimated $14 
million for demolition and $32 million to $72 million for renovation.

'It is the Eiffel Tower of Queens,' says Matthew Silva, who's making a documentary about the pavilion in Queens' Flushing Meadows Corona Park, comparing it to a remnant of the 1889 Paris Exposition that was also threatened with demolition before it was saved.

Designed by famed architect Philip Johnson, the New York structures debuted with the rest of the World's Fair on April 22, 1964, and quickly became among its most popular attractions.

Visitors rode glass 'Sky Streak' elevators to the observation deck of a 226-foot tower — the highest point in the fair. The two shorter towers, at 150 and 60 feet, held a cafeteria and a VIP lounge.

The pavilion's 16, 100-foot-tall concrete columns supported what was then the largest suspended roof in the world, a 50,000 square-foot expanse of translucent, multicolored tiles. On the floor below was a $1 million, 9,000-square-foot terrazzo tile map of the state, with details of cities, towns and highways.

The space-age towers, topped by flying-saucer-like platforms, and a pavilion once called the 'Tent of Tomorrow' are off-limits to the public

In the years after the fair, the 
pavilion was used as a music venue for such acts as Led Zeppelin, the 
Grateful Dead and Fleetwood Mac. In the '70s, it became a roller skating
 rink until the collapse of the ceiling tiles, leaving only bare cables 
behind.

The towers, while still structurally sound, were abandoned as observation decks long ago for safety reasons.

Although
 occasionally opened for tours, the towers and pavilion — the last major
 structures still standing from the World's Fair that have not been 
preserved — have largely served as a stoic landmark for travelers on the
 Van Wyck Expressway. Two pad-locked gates — one chain-link, one metal —
 keep the Tent of Tomorrow shuttered.

The New York State Pavilion was one of the most popular attractions at the 1964 World's Fair

'It
 should be called the "Tent of Yesterday,"' says Ben Haber, who lives 
near the park. 'This is not the Parthenon, it's not the Sphinx, it's not
 the pyramids. ...  So what's so special that we should keep it?'

At
 the heart of the debate is the cost. While the city's Parks Department 
commissioned studies on the cost of scrapping or renovating the complex,
 it is still unclear where that money would come from and, if restored, 
how the structures would be used. If the money comes through, work on 
the city-owned pavilion could begin as early as next year once officials
 make a decision.

Queens 
Borough President Melinda Katz has formed a task force dedicated to 
preserving the pavilion, noting that other structures from the World's 
Fair have been saved, most notably the 12-story-tall metal globe called 
the Unisphere, the Hall of Science and the Queens Museum.

Among
 the ideas are to convert the towers once again into observation decks 
or an elevated garden or even a platform for bungee jumping, with the 
open-air pavilion turned into a performance space with a removable stage
 and bleachers.

While that 
debate plays out, a small group of World's Fair buffs has formed to 
repaint the pavilion so it can be open to the public briefly for an 
April 22 anniversary event.  The towers will still be off limits.

'I
 just loved this pavilion,' says 63-year-old volunteer painter John 
Piro. 'And as the years went on I saw it decay and it just like tore my 
heart.'

Haber, the Queens resident, argues that nostalgia is fine, but the cost of saving the complex is just too much.

'Urban
 parks are the backyards for people who don't have them — so they can 
sit on the grass, look at trees, flowers, water,' Haber says. 'They do 
not want to look at glass, steel and cement structures.'
