Brendan Rodgers sat in Anfield’s trophy room this week and made a statement that had echoes of his first day in June 2012.

‘What people probably don’t get is the pressure of playing for such a big club,’ said Rodgers, attempting to explain Liverpool’s poor form. ‘The weight of the jersey here is heavy for most players. Once you adapt, you become clearer in your thinking.’

Those words struck a chord with Adam Lallana. As one of Liverpool’s marquee summer signings, the £23million fee that brought him from Southampton ensured there would be no gentle settling-in period.

Lallana agrees with Reds manager Brendan Rodgers that the Liverpool shirt can weigh heavily on new players

The 26-year-old came to Anfield carrying an injury but looked fit when he came on against West Ham last week

The Kop expects big-money recruits to make an immediate mark and the fact Lallana, having only just recovered from medial ligament damage, was rusty in his first couple of games against Aston Villa and Ludogorets, did not go unnoticed — most notably by the man himself.

‘It is something you can’t quite explain unless you have experienced it,’ said Lallana, 26. ‘There is that difference when you pull on a Liverpool shirt.’

Slowly but surely, Lallana seems to be finding his stride and he made a difference when coming on as a substitute against West Ham and during the 120 minutes he played against Middlesbrough in the Capital One cup.

The Liverpool jersey can also be a source of inspiration and that is something Lallana intends to take into Saturday’s Merseyside derby.

‘It (the expectancy) is a great feeling,’ he said. ‘You can see the relationship they (the fans) have with the players here and that is something I hope to build myself. The best way to overcome the expectation and pressure is to just try and enjoy your football.

‘Not for one minute did I think it would be easy, coming to such a big club. You have to work twice as hard and that’s what I am doing. I’m sure the other signings are as well.

‘It’s going to take a bit of adjusting, playing with new players, but I am 100 per cent confident we will be better for it.

‘We have had a tough spell but that brings everyone together. We ground out the result against Middlesbrough and we are going to have to show that side of ourselves at the minute but we will get there.

‘I never visualised it was going to be easy but I want to be tested and I want to do well.’

Such was Lallana’s determination to make a positive impression that he stayed in America with the rest of Liverpool’s touring squad rather than heading home for treatment after being injured during a training session.

Lallana made his name at Southampton, who he helped establish as a strong Premier League outfit

A bigger way to impress, though, would be to shine in a game that still has the power to create heroes. Nothing would kick-start Lallana’s Anfield career than a winning goal against the team he followed as a boy.

‘Everton always seemed to be fighting relegation when I was supporting them,’ says Lallana, whose childhood hero was goalkeeper Neville Southall. ‘I didn’t go to see them a lot because of where we lived (in St Albans) but I seem to remember there were a lot of tears.

‘I know they’ve not won at Anfield for 15 years and hopefully we can go on and get the win we need this time, too. My dad used to support Everton in the (Gary) Lineker days, when they were doing well. So that’s the reason I started following them.

‘Playing for Southampton, (my affinity) became less and less. But this is an appetising fixture, one for the fans. It would be a great game to give us that boost we need. How would I feel if I scored the winner? I can’t quite answer that. It has to happen first!’
