The longest continual zip wire in the northern hemisphere opened in a disused quarry today, with visitors able to whiz down a long zip wire suspended 700ft in the air above the Welsh mountains.

Views from Zip World will include Snowdonia, Anglesey and the Isle of Man on a clear day, but riders of the wire may not be able to take it all in as they reach speeds of nearly 100mph.

Today a grandfather-of-six became the first member of the public to experience the zip wire in Penryhn Quarry, Bethesda.

Robert Davies became the first rider to try the zip wire at Penryhn Quarry, Bethesda, today

Robert Davies, 68, who lives near the attraction at the former slate quarry, described whizzing down the mile-long wire as 'one of the most amazing things I've ever done.

'I was just doing some part-time work in the office on the site and all of a sudden they said I would be going down the wire so I didn't have time to think about it,' said the former construction worker.

'I was a bit apprehensive when I got up there but not scared. It really is an amazing view and when you are flying through the air at 95mph it is a fantastic feeling.

'You could hear me screaming the whole way down.'

The Big Zipper also has a smaller counterpart, the Little Zipper

Zip Wire Snowdonia officially opens to the public on Saturday.

Riders will be driven up to the top of 
the quarry, which was 1,200ft deep, in an ex-military vehicle for a tour of the region and a taste of its industrial history before 
being given a weather-proof suit, helmets and goggles for the ride.

The Big Zipper also has a smaller version called The Little Zipper for those who want to take it a little easier.

Seb Thompson, marketing manager for Zipwire Snowdonia, said: 'It's a really exhilarating experience that you don't get anywhere else.

'We're hoping it's going to be really popular and put North Wales on the map as the UK's number one adventure location.'

Zip World in Snowdonia overtakes the Laggan Outdoor Activity Centre in Dumfries and Galloway as the United Kingdom's longest zip line. Riders at the Scottish site can pair up on its double line or do a half a mile long ride.

Plans for a mile-long temporary zip-line in the Lake District were rejected by the Lake District National Park Authority in January.

At the Eden Project in Cornwall, visitors can ride a 0.45mile (740metre line) across the site.

In Kronplatz, Italy, a zip wire is nearly two miles long but made up of smaller lines, unlike the one in Snowdonia.

But none of these match up to the world's longest zip wire is in Sun City, South Africa. Riders speed along a 2,000metre line as high as 918ft above the ground.
