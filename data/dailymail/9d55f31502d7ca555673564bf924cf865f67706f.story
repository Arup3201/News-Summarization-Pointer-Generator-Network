The Turkish gunman who shot his British lover caught her chatting to a man on Facebook and suspected she was cheating on him.

Veli Acar, 46, told police he killed Anne Bury, 56, after he found her talking online to a man from Saudi Arabia.

When Acar, who had been in a relationship with the qualified midwife for six years, questioned her, she told him to ‘mind your business’.

Days later he returned to her Turkish villa with a shotgun and killed Ms Bury while wounding her son, Alex, 24, and her mother Cecilia, 87.

It is unknown whether the man Ms Bury was talking to on Facebook was Iain Cameron, 61, the estranged father of her son who lives in the Middle East.

The Mail on Sunday has discovered Ms Bury and Acar would sleep together in her villa when she was in Turkey but when her family came she hid their relationship by moving him to a villa she owned next door.

Acar told arresting officers he felt ‘humiliated’ by this. Since her death on Monday, Ms Bury’s family has denied they were a couple but last night a photograph emerged of Acar smiling and with his arm around her waist.

The picture was taken in a popular Turkish hotspot in 2010.

Acar told police they met in 2006 on a river cruise in Dalyan. Shortly afterwards they began a relationship and Ms Bury made frequent visits from her home in Saudi Arabia to see him.

Acar divorced his wife of ten years, Glaswegian Ruth McGarry, to be with Ms Bury in 2010. But after Acar racked up debts the couple began to argue and Ms Bury planned to break up with him on her latest visit.

She was horrified when she arrived and found Acar had printed six poster-size pictures of them to hang in his living room.

Ms Bury’ son is in hospital in Turkey and is set to fly home tomorrow. His grandmother has been released from hospital.

Last night Ms Bury’s brother Jerome said: ‘We have been told her killer will spend a long time in prison and that is a comfort to us.’
