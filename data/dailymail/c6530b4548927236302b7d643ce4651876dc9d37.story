Carl Froch has been ordered to fight Andre Ward for a second time within the next four months.

Froch holds the regular WBA super-middleweight world title and Ward the 'Super' version and the organisation has given them 30 days to reach an agreement.

Ward comfortably outpointed the Nottingham Cobra when they met in 2011 but has fought only twice since.

Froch recently relinquished his IBF belt to allow domestic rival James DeGale to fight for the vacant belt.

And the 37-year-old has shown little interest in a rematch with Ward. Indeed, Froch was due to fight Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas next month but had to withdraw through injury.

Meanwhile, Bernard Hopkins has hit back at Froch after the Nottingham fighter suggested a title bout against the 50-year-old American would be a 'lose-lose situation'.

Hopkins, speaking to Sky Sports, said: 'You should put all the pressure on that coward that calls himself one of the greatest European fighters of all time.

'That is not true, that’s an insult to Joe Calzaghe, and let me tell you something - that's an insult to any great fighter that has come out of the UK from the past and the present.

'To hear a guy make excuses for a legitimate force that he knows he will lose against and possibly lose his career, like many other fighters did when they stepped in the ring with "The Alien". '
