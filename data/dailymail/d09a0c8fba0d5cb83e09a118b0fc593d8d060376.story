Mesut Ozil admits he was delighted Arsenal secured the services of 'world class' forward Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona.

The German international signed for the club for a club record £42.5m fee last summer, and is joined at the club by Sanchez this season.

Ozil is looking to kick on in his second campaign in England and believes the Chilean forward has given the whole club a lift.

'Not just me, but I think the whole team are happy because we've added a world class player,' Ozil told Arsenal Player. 

'He played at Barcelona and scored lots of goals so you know he has quality and we're pleased to have him.

'I’m sure we'll see lots of goals from him this season.'

Ozil was criticised by large sections last year after struggling with form and injuries at times. Despite this, the World Cup-winning playmaker still contributed with nine assists and five goals in the Premier League.

The 25-year-old says he is 'proud' by his feats as chief creator, and believes they are just as important as the goals scored. He still wants more though, both individually and as a team.

He added: 'I'm very confident because I know the potential I have. We’ve become more mature and we've learned from our mistakes. If we stay fit and healthy, anything is possible

'We have big ambitions, you can't be satisfied in finishing second or third or making the round of 16 in the Champions League. 

'I missed playing football while on holiday, I'm pleased we are underway, we want to reach our ambitions. We need to be a team, believe. Then we can achieve it.'

Mesut Ozil says he is benefiting in the Premier League because Arsene Wenger trusts him

In a recent interview, Arsene Wenger said 'everything Ozil does is intelligent, absolutely perfect.' While Ozil wasn't so sure about such gushing praise, he was thankful for the trust of his manager. 

'I'm not so sure about the praise, I always have to deliver on the pitch.

' It's important what the boss thinks, he trusts me and he knows my potential, I’m grateful for the faith. If he says I play intelligently, it’s probably right!
