Manchester United will not name Louis van Gaal as their new manager until next week.

The Barclays Premier League club have agreed most of the details of the 62-year-old’s new contract at Old Trafford and had hoped to officially announce the appointment on Thursday.

It is understood, however, that United have not yet managed to agree upon all the specifics with their incoming manager.

Club sources stressed on Thursday 
morning that there is no problem with the deal and they remain sure that
 Van Gaal will be confirmed next week.

However,
 with Van Gaal currently preparing the Holland squad for a 
friendly on Saturday, there is only so much time he can spend in 
conversation with his future employers at the moment.

Once Holland’s friendly with Ecuador is out of the way on Saturday, United hope to sit down with Van Gaal again the next day.

Ryan Giggs meanwhile, has been offered the job as Van Gaal’s No 2 after holding talks at the Dutchman’s penthouse apartment.

Giggs
 was seen coming out of a hotel in the seaside town of Noordwijk, 20 
miles southwest of Amsterdam, and it is understood that the discussions 
took place at Van Gaal’s luxury home a few hundred yards away.

Van Gaal, 62, is said to have offered Giggs the job as his assistant although it is unclear if the United icon has accepted yet.

The
 Holland coach made the most of a day off from his World Cup camp in 
Hoenderloo to return to Noordwijk and meet Giggs, having arranged the 
talks last week.

Dutch training will resume on Thursday when 
more foreign-based players, including United striker Robin van Persie, 
join up with the squad ahead of Saturday’s warm-up game against Ecuador.

Van
 Gaal honoured a commitment to attend a book launch in Amsterdam on Wednesday night but refused to answer questions about United.

Giggs, 
meanwhile, flew in by private jet and was driven to the exclusive Hotel 
Orangerie and then to Van Gaal’s home nearby where an underground garage
 enabled him to arrive unseen. He returned to Manchester to 
attend Wednesday night’s Premier League Under-21 Final between United and 
Chelsea at Old Trafford which the Blues won 2-1.

During their meeting, Van Gaal is 
understood to have emphasised his commitment to playing attacking 
football, as well as outlining the role Giggs would have in the new 
set-up.

The 40-year-old grew disillusioned with United’s cautious
 style under Moyes as well as his own peripheral role in the backroom 
team before taking charge as interim boss for the final four games of 
the season following the Scot’s sacking.

If he accepts the job, 
Giggs will be one of two assistants to Van Gaal, who prefers to have a 
Dutch coach and one with close links to the club by his side, as was the
 case during his time in charge at AZ Alkmaar, Barcelona and Bayern 
Munich.

Van Gaal is keen to draw heavily on Giggs’s knowledge and
 insight of United. He is particularly interested in the youth academy 
and has already picked the former Wales international’s brains over the 
top young players coming through at the club, as well as the senior 
stars who could be coming and going this summer.

In his last home game in charge, it was notable that Giggs gave senior debuts to James Wilson, 18, and 20-year-old Tom Lawrence.

The
 identity of his other, Dutch, assistant remains unclear however. Van 
Gaal has not offered Patrick Kluivert the job and Rene Meulensteen, 
United’s first-team coach under Sir Alex Ferguson, remains a 
possibility.

Frans Hoek is almost certain to join Van Gaal at United as goalkeeper coach along with video analyst Max Reckers.

The
 new management will have a major rebuilding job on their hands after a 
dismal season at Old Trafford descended into bickering and acrimony 
among the players.
