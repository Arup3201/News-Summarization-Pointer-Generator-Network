The victim of a random street attack has shared images of the moment she chased her violent attacker down for a photo that led to his arrest.

Erica Moloney, from Toorak in Melbourne's south-east, was on her way to the train station after a gym class in the CBD when a passing man suddenly punched her in the face.

'I didn't even see it coming because I was on my phone, he knocked the glasses off my face,' Ms Moloney told Daily Mail Australia of the attack, which occurred on Wednesday night.

'I just slumped down, I was so shocked.'

Erica Moloney, from Toorak in Melbourne's south-east, was on her way to the train station after a gym class in the CBD, when a passing man suddenly punched her in the face

Furious and confused, the 32-year-old chased down her assailant to snap a photo of him (pictured). After demanding to know why he had hit her, the man said to her: 'do you want another one, you stupid b****?'

The 32-year-old, who was comforted by a nearby hotel-owner, then did what most people wouldn't.

Furious and confused, she went in search of her assailant.

'I was so confused and didn't know why anyone would do this. My instinct just kicked in and I wanted to see who did it and I wanted to get a snap of him, because that's how you can potentially get the guy,' Ms Moloney said.

'I think adrenalin had kicked in. They say people have either a fight or flight response, but I guess I have third option which is "photo".'

The brave woman then took to social media to share images of both her bleeding face and her attacker, warning others to stay away from the man

Ms Moloney praised police and paramedics for their quick response. The man was arrested within an hour of punching her 

When she finally found her attacker, just up the street, Ms Moloney yelled out to him from 10 metres away, demanding to know why he had hit her. 

'He responded by saying: "do you want another one, you stupid b****?" That riled me up a little bit,' she said.

The brave woman then took to social media to share images of both her bleeding face and her attacker, warning others to stay away from the man.

But within less than an hour, after paramedics had cleaned up her face, the man walked by as she was giving her statement to police.

One day after the attack: 'The bruising will fade, but everyone's love and kindness in the face of senseless violence will stay with me forever - thank you!' Ms Moloney posted to her Instagram account 

'I spotted him and recognised him from the photo and said 'that's him'. The policeman taking my statement just stepped outside, called for back-up and they were on the scene pretty quickly and apprehended him,' Ms Moloney said.

A 33-year-old man has since been charged with a series of alleged crimes committed on Flinders Lane, including two counts of recklessly causing serious injury, The Age has reported.

Still shaken by the incident, Ms Moloney hopes to share her story in an effort to help others get through their own violent encounters.

While she says she has received 'an overwhelming amount of support' since the incident, she admits a few people have warned her about being in 'the rough end of town'.

'It was 7:30 at night. I should be able to walk from a gym class to a train station,' she said.

'I think the thing to take away is that random things can happen and they can be horrible, but don't let it bring you down and don't let it run your life

'Stand up for yourself, don't do anything stupid, but know that some behaviours are unacceptable and if someone does something wrong to you, absolutely speak out.'
