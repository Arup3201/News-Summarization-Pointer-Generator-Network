Scandinavia may be known for its grey, downbeat television thrillers, but something has recently brought a smile to their faces: A contender for the world's most 'ridiculously photogenic' policeman.

Henrik Ruonala posted a photo of himself with a lost puppy on Facebook in a bid to find the animal's owner - and overnight became the most desirable man in Sweden.

Officer Ruonala, who is based at a station in Sk√§rholmen, a suburb south of Stockholm, put the picture of himself and the Yorkshire Terrier on the station's Facebook page alongside the message: 'Is there someone missing this little fellow, we found him Wednesday night and he is now at our police station.'

Ladies' man: Police officer Henrik Ruonala has become the most wanted single man in Sweden after posting a photo of himself with a missing puppy on Facebook last week

Little did he know that the post would go viral and he would be inundated with messages from admiring ladies.

The picture has now been liked by some 25,000 women and over 1,700 comments have been posted commenting on the young officer's Viking good looks.

Its incredible popularity has brought comparisons between Officer Ruonala and the 'Ridiculously Photogenic Guy' meme that went viral in April, making a worldwide star of handsome Zeddie Little.

Under the photo of Officer Ruonala, one lustful lady wrote: 'Too bad the guy in the picture is not missing, I could really think of taking care of him.'

Another said: 'It is war now ladies, the man in uniform is mine.'

Mr Ruonala is shocked by the attention. 
While he has not been on a date with any of the women, he has received 
lots of offers - some more graphic than others - in recent days.

'I'd love two for the price of one. Mmmmmm.'

'I want make him dinner, have him in my kitchen right now.'

'I want to go on a date with the guy in the picture, we can get a dog later.'

'l'lI take the policeman, somebody else can take the dog.'

'It is war now ladies, the man in uniform is mine'

'He can sleep on my stomach. The dog can sleep on the sofa.'

'Never mind the dog, I want to take that little fellow in uniform with me home.'

The officer said: 'I have my own dog, he is a four-year-old Rottweiler named Rex. I guess I have some explaining to do when I 
come home and meet him now.'

The photo has also been shared by more than 2,000 people and some comments have been written by excited women as far afield as Germany and Italy.

At the small 
police station where he works, Mr Ruonala's colleagues are now having some fun at his expense.

Chief Constable Mikael Sundberg said: 'As his superior, I would like to 
tell everyone that Henry is single and I would also like to add that his
superior is also single and even better-looking.'

The puppy, called Chico, has now been reunited with his owners.

They wrote on Facebook: 'We are very happy to have 
our beloved Chico at home again and that he is well.

'We hope that Henrik
now will find the woman of his dreams and live happily ever after. Our 
little dog has really given him a chance, so now it is up to him.'

Admirers: Mr Ruonala's army of female fans stretches way beyond Sweden

The 'Ridiculously Photogenic...' trend began when photographer Will King took a picture of Zeddie Little running the 10km Cooper Bridge run in his hometown of Charleston, South Carolina.

The photograph was posted on Flickr and Mr Little became an internet sensation - even appearing on television show Good Morning America as Ridiculously Photogenic Guy.

He was followed by Ridiculously Photogenic Surgery Girl - also known as Rachel - who became a similar internet sensation after posting a photograph of herself in hospital as she recovered from lung surgery.

The internet's eye was then - bizarrely - drawn to the Syrian civil war, where a handsome soldier carrying a grenade launcher liberated people's hearts with his smouldering looks to become Ridiculously Photogenic Syrian Rebel.

It was only a matter of time before a sports star became the focus of the craze, and New England Patriots wide receiver Brandon Lloyd's smile for the camera as he scored a touchdown three weeks ago was the textbook 'Ridiculously...' photo opportunity.

The moment will be recorded in sports history for nothing more than the six points, but to those in the know it will be forever remembered as the birth of Ridiculously Photogenic Football Player.
