A BBC report about the Dale Farm evictions was biased, according to an internal investigation.

Basildon Council had complained of misleading coverage, saying The One Show had effectively sided with the travellers at the illegal site.

And the corporation’s editorial standards committee has now found that the broadcast breached impartiality rules.

On the show, one traveller had claimed the Essex council was ‘throwing us out on the road’ with nowhere to go.

In fact, Basildon, which was given no right to reply, had offered to rehouse and relocate travellers.

A subsequent studio discussion with presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones and studio guest Neil Morrissey, also broke rules by creating an ‘overall impression’ that was ‘unfair’ to the local authority.

Mr Morrissey suggested the council may have earmarked the site for development and wanted to sell it for a profit. A Panorama programme last month sparked complaints of bias in favour of the travellers, a claim also levelled at some BBC news coverage.

Basildon Council was furious about the report – broadcast in February – calling it biased, badly researched and misleading.

Editorial failing: The One Show was found to have been less than clear about the status of the Essex site

The council said a clip taken from a 2005 documentary about the row had been used to show local residents in a negative light. It added that there was no mention of the unauthorised site being on green belt land.

The BBC Trust rebuke came in an appeal lodged after an initial complaint was rejected.

Yesterday’s report said: ‘It was unfair that the council was not given the opportunity to reply to the accusation relating to its statutory homelessness obligations.

‘The live studio discussion had been unfair to the council because it highlighted the estimated £13million cost to move families and posed the question to the studio guest of whether the cost could be justified. This question had resulted in a response which went unchallenged by the presenters.’

The Trust said the rest of the report was ‘duly accurate’.

Tony Ball, who leads Basildon Council, said last night: ‘The site clearance of Dale Farm has always been about the protection of the green belt, but this was not accurately portrayed by The One Show report, nor the fact that we had made several offers of housing to traveller families.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We note the findings, which we have taken very seriously.’

Protest: The council spent some £20million to evacuate the protesters from the site in October

The six-acre site in Crays Hill was cleared last month.

The number of gypsies and travellers in England has almost trebled over the past 100 years, statistics suggest.

Latest figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government put the number at 18,600 in July 2011. According to the website Genesreunited, 6,985 were classed as travellers in the 1911 census.
