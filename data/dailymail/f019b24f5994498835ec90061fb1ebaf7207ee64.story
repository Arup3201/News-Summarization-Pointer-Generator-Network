An investigation is underway today into the death of a 24-year-old college graduate working as a lead singer aboard a luxury cruise ship after her body was found in Australia.

Authorities say Jackie Kastrinelis of Groveland, Massachusetts was found dead in her cabin aboard Regent Cruise Lines' Seven Seas voyager after the ship docked in Darwin Harbour on Sunday morning.

The cabin was originally being treated as a crime scene but her death is no longer deemed suspicious, according to police while the cause of her death remains unknown.

Accident: The 2010 graduate of the University of Hartford's Hartt School, seen performing on the ship, is said by one source to have hit her head during a rehearsal before found in her room

An unidentified source claims that the 
2010 University of Hartford graduate suffered a head injury during a 
rehearsal the night before and was possibly given medication by a ship 
doctor, Cruise Law News reports.

An autopsy is currently underway while Australian authorities say it could take weeks to months for the toxicology test results to return.

Her family, left without answers, were releasing no comment on Monday pending further information, her brother Andrew Kastrinelis told the Hartford Courant.

They have since flown to Australia to meet her body.

Miss Kastrinelis was the lead singer aboard the cruise liner since 2011, according to Jean Ann Ryan Productions who's responsible for her hire.

Jean Ann Ryan described the young singer as a 'ray of sunshine, a life force and a beautiful person,' according to Boston.com.'...she loved performing, she was a great singer.'

'She made a very big impression on everyone,' Verderame, who lectured aboard Regent ships as an art appraiser told the Courant. 'She won't be forgotten.'

Before her work as a cruise singer, Miss Kastrinelis graduated from Hartford's Hartt School of performing arts with a bachelor of fine arts degree.

‘She was a really bright personality, very engaging, warm-hearted,’ University spokesman David Isgur told the Courant.

During her time in the Hartt School 
she additionally worked as a news reporter for student-run new station 
STN2 who expressed their own grief over news of the young star’s death 
on Monday.

‘It is with 
great sadness that STN2 is able to confirm that former anchor and 
reporter Jackie Kastrinelis, a member of the Hartt [School at University
 of Hartford] Class of 2010 died over the weekend,’ they wrote.

‘Kastrinelis was a popular and talented Hartt performer, and personality at CHANNEL 2.’

A statement released by Regent Seven Seas Cruises said they were mutually ‘deeply saddened by the loss of one of our own,’ adding, ‘our hearts and prayers go out to the family and loved ones.’
