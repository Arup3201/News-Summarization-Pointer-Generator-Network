Seeing the Northern Lights has overtaken the Pyramids and Great Barrier Reef at the top of the typical Briton’s holiday wish list, according to a survey.The poll found that witnessing the Aurora Borealis in Norway has overtaken traditional tourist destinations to become the must-see holiday sight.The study by Travelsupermarket.com found more than half of us (54 per cent) have compiled a ‘Holiday Bucket List’ – a list of places they want to visit before they die.

The Northern Lights, otherwise known as Aurora Borealis, is the new must-see destination, with 37 per cent of travellers putting it on the top of their 'holiday bucket list'

Egypt's ancient Pyramids in Giza is still a top destination for holiday makers, coming second on a new poll by Travelsupermarket.com

However, one in ten of us will never tick anything off our list of holiday ambitions, and 32 per cent are resigned to visiting fewer than half of our must-see destinations.

The top ten destinations are: 1, Aurora 
Borealis (37 per cent);  2, Pyramids (35pc); 3, Route 66 (33pc); 4, 
Great Wall of China (32pc); 5, African safari (31pc); 6, Helicopter ride
 over Grand Canyon (30pc); 7, Caribbean cruise (29pc); 8, Taj Mahal 
(28pc); 9, Venice (27pc);  10, Great Barrier Reef (24pc). 

The Great Wall of China, which dates back to the 7th century BC, remains in the top ten must-visit destinations, with 32 per cent of people wanting to visit before they die

Once-in-a-lifetime opportunities include an African safari and a helicopter ride over the Gran Canyon

Travelsupermarket’s Bob Atkinson said: ‘Ten years ago African safaris and Route 66 road trips were appealing mainly because they were perceived to be once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.

‘The world is a lot more accessible now, so we’re seeing destinations much closer to home become popular because people have decided it’s something they must see.’

While we are most likely to compile a countdown of our ideal holidays around the age of 32, the constraints of settling down and having children force many to think again about travelling to far-flung destinations.Young adults between 18 and 34 are 51 per cent more likely to aim for cultural experiences such as the Rio Carnival in Brazil than those over 55, who prioritise trips closer to home.Explaining why we make 'bucket lists', especially when it comes to dream holidays, behaviour specialist Seven Suphi explains: 'We set goals in all aspects of our lives, from our careers to our relationships and families, and our holidays are no different.'While realising some dreams might be out of our hands, travel can be a great thing to focus on, allowing us to set goals which we can achieve, providing we save and plan appropriately.

'Holiday Bucket Lists can be very 
valuable - having something to look forward to keeps us motivated, and 
pushing ourselves to try something out of the ordinary can be 
exhilarating.'
