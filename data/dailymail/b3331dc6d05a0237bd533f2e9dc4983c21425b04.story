A bungling burglar who stole Â£700 of drugs left his address in a bag near the pharmacy he plundered.

Idiotic Darren Henderson, 31, had only been out of prison for a day when he raided the chemist's in Norwich.

But the blundering late-night crook's plan backfired when police found a bicycle with a bag with his address and ID inside.

Henderson, of Norwich, admitted burgling the Woodside Pharmacy on June 7 before city magistrates yesterday.

The serial offender triggered the shop's alarm at 2am and police found a hole in the building's roof with a ladder hanging down.

Cops found medicines strewn across the floor inside.

Return: Henderson's case was adjourned to Norwich Magistrates' Court for sentencing in two weeks

Officers found a bike nearby with a black bag hidden in bushes containing Henderson's ID.

Police dashed straight to the hardcore junkie's home and arrested the hapless criminal.

They discovered drugs hidden in his shoes and jacket.

James Landles, defending, said Henderson had been freed from prison just the day before and he had burgled the pharmacy to get drugs.

Mr Landles told JPs: 'The root cause of this is his desire to escape from living in the real world.

'He came out of prison still on class A drugs. He was at a low ebb.'

He added: 'He was desperate. He had been released with nothing to go to - nobody for support.'

The case was adjourned to Norwich Magistrates' Court for sentencing for two weeks while reports are prepared.

JPs warned Henderson he had committed a serious offence and he could go straight back to prison.
