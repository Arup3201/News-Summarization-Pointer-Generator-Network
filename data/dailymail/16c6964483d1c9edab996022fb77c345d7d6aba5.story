A man who was once severely obese has shed 390lbs and is now running half marathons.

Brian Flemming, from Canton, Michigan, has undergone a dramatic transformation since 2012, when he weighed 625lbs.

The 32-year-old completed his first half-marathon on July 28, 2013, and is currently gearing up for the Detroit Free Press Half Marathon on Sunday.

Runner's high: Brian Flemming, from Canton, Michigan, has shed 390lbs and is now running half marathons

Mr Flemming, a music instructor, has run nine 5K races and four 10Ks.

'Hopefully, next time this year I'll be running the full marathon,' he told Detroit Free Press.

Before he began his weight loss journey, Mr Flemming was pre-diabetic and had been struggling with depression and alcoholism, drinking a fifth of vodka mixed with a liter of soda each night.

'My typical fast-food meal was a double cheeseburger with a large pop and large fries,' Flemming wrote on his blog.

'That usually wasn't enough, so I would have chicken nuggets with it as well. I also ate Arby's frequently. Large roast beef sandwich, large curly fries and drink, and a side of mozzarella sticks. I ate fast food every day,' he added.

In spring 2012, Mr Flemming was playing Draw Something, a Pictionary-inspired app, which randomly matched him with Jackie Eastham, a woman 20 years his senior in London.

He began chatting with Ms Eastham, who has myotonic muscular dystrophy, a condition that causes progressive wasting of the muscles and other symptoms.

To manage her condition, Eastham follows an extremely healthy lifestyle, and never takes her well-being for granted.

A friendship grew, and Mr Flemming began to confide in her about his weight problems, and about his drinking, a secret he'd kept even from his parents.

He was expecting sympathy, but was thrown by her response.

'She told me that I was wasting my life and that I should be ashamed that I was throwing it away when there are so many people out there who are fighting to stay alive,' Mr Flemming wrote.

'My future is a lot gloomier. I'm trying to make the brightest future I can, and... you're dragging yourself down,' Ms Eastham told CNN she recalls thinking.

On October 13, 2012, he made the decision to quit drinking cold-turkey, and drastically change his diet.

He eventually began walking in place for five minutes.

'I did it little by little,' Mr Flemming said. 'I started walking outside and could barely make it around the block and I added to that little by little. Eventually I walked my first mile.'

With Ms Eastham cheering him on by phone, he got to the point where he was walking five miles every morning.

'I dropped 100 pounds over three months. It came off really fast. I was over 350 pounds still when I started running in little increments at a time,' he said.

Looking good: Mr Flemming hopes to be running a full marathon by this time next year

He also began cycling 44 miles to and from work every Friday.

He and Ms Eastham began a Facebook group, Team 383, to motivate others to achieve their weight loss goals.

Now preparing for his second half-marathon, Mr Flemming has a new outlook on life and even took a trip to London last December to meet his biggest supporter.

While there, he and Ms. Eastham traveled to Paris together and climbed the Eiffel Tower.

'In 18 months, I went from being able to barely climb stairs to climbing the Eiffel Tower,' he said.
