This lion appears to be unimpressed with the recent cold weather - letting out a ferocious roar that emerges in a giant cloud of air.

The male beast, named Ingozi, was captured roaring in the freezing temperatures at St Louis Zoo in Missouri, U.S.

And visitors could see the full force of his temper as his warm breath struck the cold atmosphere - turning into a white mist.

The frosty moment was caught on camera by photographer Lisa Kee, 43, at the zoo in Forest Park.

'It was a cold March morning about 1C (34F) when I decided to visit the zoo and take some photographs of the lions,' she said.

'Ingozi roaring was a powerful sound - but the addition of the frigid air to his warm breath meant it became a spectacular sight as well.

'Suddenly there was steam flowing all around his head. I had no idea I was going to capture such an amazing event.'

Earlier this year, devastating storms and freezing blasts of Arctic air swept across the U.S. - causing widespread disruption, including the cancellation of thousands of flights.

Temperatures reached such extreme lows across the Midwest that Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago was forced to keep their polar bear Anana indoors in a 'climate-controlled' area.

However, the weather has warmed up in recent weeks as the winter gives way to spring.
