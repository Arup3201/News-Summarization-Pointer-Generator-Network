This five-month-old kitten risked losing one of his nine lives today on his very first outing - when he had to be rescued from a chimney stack 30ft high.

It took the RSPCA, seven firefighters, an aerial platform and a very worried owner to coax Archie, a British blue cross, down from the roof of the three-storey house.

He had only been recently adopted from a rescue centre by owner 47-year-old Andy Gillies when he tried to make a dash for freedom.

Stuck: Mischievous moggy Archie found himself in an unfamiliar position during his first foray into the outside world after being recently adopted from a rescue centre

Platform: East Sussex Fire and Rescue needed an 
aerial platform to capture Archie. They said they only come out to cat 
rescues if called by the RSPCA

Tired out: Archie's owner Andy Gillies said his pet had been subdued since his adventure

Instead the mischievous moggy ended up trapped on top of his new home in Brighton and it took more than 40 minutes for him to be rescued.

RSPCA animal welfare officer Steve Wickham said: 'I think he must have been attracted by the warm chimney stacks or was possibly chasing a bird.'

Mr Gillies, an accountant from Brighton, East Sussex said: 'Archie wasn't allowed out as he hadn't yet had his vaccinations.

'We realised he had gone missing last night when we couldn't find him in the house, I went outside looking for him and eventually saw him on the roof.

'I was convinced he must have climbed up the chimney and was calling for him up there and he was meowing back - but he didn't budge.

'I called the RSPCA who told us to wait till morning and see if he moved.

'We started to worry when we heard the seagulls circling this morning in case they pecked him but the RSPCA came round straight away with the fire service.'

East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service confirmed they had a call from the RSPCA this morning.

A spokesman said: 'After a request from the RSPCA we sent a fire engine and an aerial ladder with seven fire-fighters to the address.

'We don't normally attend cat on roof rescues unless the RSPCA contact us.'

Mr Gillies said it is still a mystery how his cat managed to get on the roof.

He said Archie did not smell of soot and may have climbed out of the window.

He added: 'I have no idea how he did it.

'He is much more docile today. I think he realises he has had a bit of an adventure.'
