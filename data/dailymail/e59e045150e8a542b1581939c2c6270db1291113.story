A US doctor's plan to develop a formula for 'vacation breasts' that sees cup size increase for a period of two to three weeks has been met with concern by a top UK plastic surgeon.

New York-based specialist Dr Norman Rowe's research into temporary breast enhancement is set to be developed into a treatment that could give women the ultimate beach body for a holiday.

However, a British surgeon says there are risks associated with the treatment, including infection, severe bruising and even being left with breasts of totally different sizes for an unknown amount of time.

For women who strive for the perfect bikini body, the new temporary boob-job might be welcomed

Dr Rowe, who developed the 24-hour InstaBreast, is now working on a new project, aptly tagged 'vacation breasts' which will extend the lifespan of a saline injection. 

But Dr Ash Mosahebi, director of surgery of the London Plastic Surgery Centre, with over 15 years experience in the field, is sceptical about the process.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline Travel, consultant plastic surgeon and British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) member Dr Mosahebi said: 'I can see why this is being looked at, and sometimes temporary solutions kind of work.

'But for me the main issue is the chance of getting infections and the chance of further complications. 

It is a 'quick fix' for women to boost their cup size, but what are the risks involved with 'vacation breasts'? 

UK-based surgeon Dr Ash Mosahebi has warned their could be problems with such a procedure

'There is much more to consider than it just been a 'quick fix' - if it's not done right there is a chance you could puncture a lung.

The 'vacation breasts' procedure appears straightforward and safe by recent details published in the US media.

However, as with any intrusive action on the human body there are risks to be wary of. 

These could be: 

'If it sounds so simple as just putting a needle in and getting bigger breasts then you will get more and more people not only wanting it done and more and more people who want to do it - but it has to be done correctly.

'The key thing for me is, what you rely on here is that the saline is absorbed, but one side could go quicker than the other. You could be left with one side a B cup and one side a D cup, and who knows how long for.

'These are the risks that are taken as it is not a controlled process.' 

Dr Rowe's hopes are that women will take advantage of the treatment for holidays and special occasions, as well as give them a real feeling of what a potential 'under the knife' operation will feel like day to day.

But Dr Mosahebi believes rather than simply take on-board the short-term benefits and psychological advantages, it's vital any potential customers are aware of the facts.

'Sometimes we do experiments similar (on an artificial breast) on the table in the lab, just to see what it would be like,' added the 46-year-old expert.

It is believed that a two-three week breast size increase could help a woman decide if she wanted to opt for a permanent cup enhancement

'We know of what the results could be, but I can't imagine people would know all the facts about the operation.'

US-based Dr Rowe pioneered the InstaBreast procedure where, after only between 15 and 20 minutes, women's breasts are given a boost by a simple saline injection.

The enhancement lasts for roughly 24 hours before the breasts return to their normal size.
