Hard-partying New York nightlife impresario Vikram Chatwal is fighting to get back the engagement ring he gave his supermodel ex-fiance six months ago - and is taking the battle to the Manhattan Supreme Court.

According to Page Six, Chatwal - the founder of Manhattan's luxe Dream hotels who once dated Gisele Bundchen and Kate Moss and has been linked to Lindsay Lohan - is suing Esther Canadas, best known for being the face of DKNY, for the $300,000 8-carat rock, which is made of emeralds and diamonds.

'The plaintiff, Vikram Chatwal, believed his dream had come true when defendant, Esther Cañadas, accepted his marriage proposal, but his dream morphed into a nightmare when upon the termination of the engagement, the defendant left the United States with the engagement ring as the spoils of the romance,' the suit says.

'The relief sought is the return of the engagement ring from the Defendant or a money judgment of $313,560, plus interest, costs, disbursements and reasonable legal fees, along with such other and further relief as this court may deem just and proper.

The couple were only engaged in September after multimillionaire, 42, proposed to Cañadas, 37, during a visit to St. Patrick’s Cathedral in new York's Midtown.'

Just a few weeks later, the on-again, off-again couple said they were kaput for good.

Cañadas, who was born in Spain, now lives in the tiny resort of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

Chatwal’s celebrity lawyer, Mark Heller, declined comment on the lawsuit.

The privileged son of Hampshire Hotels & Resorts founder Sant Singh Chatwal, Chatwal helps oversee his family’s empire.

On his Vikram Chatwal Hotels website, he calls himself 'an international tastemaker and man-about-town', adding, 'in 2005 he was named as one of the world’s most eligible bachelors by Radar Magazine'.

'He is also well-known for his career as a Bollywood actor and friendships with some of Hollywood’s most influential stars,’ the site says.

Chatwal still has a 'G’ tattoo on his left shoulder from his brief affair with Bündchen and parties on his 150-foot yacht, Fathom.

In 2011, he entered rehab for alcohol addiction.

He was then arrested at a Florida airport in April for drugs after he tried to board a plane with a stash of cocaine, pot and prescription pills — as well as heroin hidden in the crotch of his pants.

He has since completed another stint in rehab.

Police say Chatwal was packing heroin, cocaine, ketamine, pot and an assortment of powerful pills when 'behavior detection officers' flagged him for a search at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in April 2013
