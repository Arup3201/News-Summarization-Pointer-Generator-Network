Inventions from the Wright brother’s flying machine to Apple's iPod are some of the most instantly recognisable in the world and define entire eras.

Now a group of artists have sourced the patents for the game-changing gadgets and recreated their designs in a collection of stylish blueprints to celebrate the iconic designs.

They include inventions as simple as the Lego brick and other more complex designs, such as the first typewriter or a Harley Davidson motorcycle.

A group of artists have sourced the patents for iconic objects and recreated their designs in a collection of stylish blueprints. They include the print for Nintendo's Game Boy (pictured) which together with the later Game Boy Colour, sold almost 119 million units across the world

The designs were the idea of the Florida-based art company Oliver Gal Artist Co, whose works feature not only the intricate designs of the objects, but also the history behind each.

The company hopes that in a world where inventions that are becoming ever more complex, the images will stand as a reminder of the thinking that went into each of the classic designs.

The reworked blueprints include some of our favourite toys such as the Lego brick, which was awarded it’s for U.S. patent for a ‘toy building brick’ in 1961 – and has now expired – meaning that anyone can copy it.

Another design featuring in the series includes the first iPod, which was released on October 23, 2001, just over eight months after iTunes was released. It had just 5GB of storage and because it was expensive and only compatible with Macs, sales were pretty slow until 2004

World-changing inventions such as the gun and first flying machine are also included in the series of blueprints. One of them (pictured) shows the firing mechanism of the revolver handgun, which was patented on December 6, 1881

Since the Danish company began making its interlocking bricks in 1949, around 560 billion have been produced.

The blueprints also feature another childhood favourite - the Slinky - which was patented in 1947. The toy was invented by naval engineer Richard James in 1943 and was a sell-out hit when it launched for $1 two years later. In 60 years it has sold over 300 million units and has been used as a toy, teaching tool, wartime radio antenna and even as a physics experiment by Nasa.

Blueprints of the Rubik’s Cube go some way as to explain its fiendish difficulty to solve. In a classic Rubik’s Cube each of the six faces is covered by nine stickers in white, red, blue, yellow, green and orange and an internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently to mix up the colours.

The way we listen to music has changed dramatically over the decades. A re-designed blueprint for the phonograph record is pictured left, and another for the tape - a symbol of the 1980s - is pictured on the right, showing its intricate method of feeding film between rollers

The retractable ballpoint pen is pictured. Ballpoint pens have been around since 1888 and dispense a viscous ink from an internal reservoir through the rolling action of a metal ball at its point. The mechanism was originally developed as a cleaner and reliable alternative to fountain pens and millions are manufactured and sold every day

Sewing machines were invented during the first Industrial Revolution to decrease the amount of manual sewing work performed in clothing companies. Since the invention of the first working sewing machine, generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790, there have been many designs, including the Wheeler & Dial model (pictured left).  The classic and intricate design of the typewriter is pictured on the right

World-changing inventions such as the gun and first flying machine are also included in the series of blueprints.

One of them shows the firing mechanism of the revolver handgun, which was patented on December 6, 1881.

The ingenious structure of the Wright brothers’ flying machine was patented in 1906 by the two American aviation pioneers who built the world’s first successful airplane and made the first controlled and powered human flight in a machine heavier than air, in 1903.

The Slinky was patented in 1947 and was invented by naval engineer Richard James in 1943. It was a sell-out hit when it launched for $1 two years later. In 60 years it has sold over 300million units and has been used as a toy, teaching tool, wartime radio antenna and even as a physics experiment by Nasa

Photographic viewfinder apparatus by H.A. Bing is included in the collection of re-worked blueprints, (pictured left) along with the design for a compact camera with a zoom, which was awarded a patent in 1932, pictured right, - despite looking more modern than the 1960s design on the left

Blueprints of the Rubik's Cube (pictured) go some way as to explain its fiendish difficulty to solve. In a classic Rubik's Cube each of the six faces is covered by nine stickers in white, red, blue, yellow, green and orange and an internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently to mix up the colours

It is easy to forget that items we take for granted, like the tennis racket, were invented and designed by someone. The method for stringing the racket (pictured left) was patented in 1907 and the design of boxing gloves (pictured right) was patented in 1923

In more modern times, objects such as the vinyl record, the iPod and Nintendo Game Boy are easily recognisable and are part of the series of artwork based on their original blueprints.

The U.S. patent for Nintendo’s Game Boy was awarded in 1993. It was Nintendo’s second held-held games console and together with the Game Boy Colour, sold almost 119million units across the world. The console has been a huge success since its launch, when it sold its entire shipment in the U.S. within a few weeks.

One of the most recognisable guitars in the world, the Gibson Les Paul is a solid body electric guitar that was first sold in 1952. Versions of the famous model have been played by guitar legends including Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townsend, Jimmy Page, Slash and Eric Clapton. A patent of the boom box, which became a must-have of the 1980s and 1990s, is pictured right

The re-worked blueprints include some of our favourite toys such as the Lego brick, which was awarded it's for U.S. patent for a 'toy building brick' in 1961 - and has now expired - meaning that anyone can copy it

While CDs were not widely adapted until the late 1980s, and became the main music format in the 1990s, a patent for the technology (pictured left) was filed in 1960. A patent for the forward lean adjuster mechanism for ski boots is pictured on the right

The iPod might have spawned a hundred imitations, but the original AppleMP3 player was patented as recently as 2008.

The first iPod was released on October 23, 2001, just over eight months after iTunes was released with 5GB of storage but because it was expensive and only compatible with Macs, sales were pretty slow until 2004. Since then there have been six generations of iPod, the largest of which has 160GB of storage, as well as more compact iPod Minis, Nanos and Shuffles and the iPod Touch, which has a touch screen much like the iPhone.

Berliner Gramophone was an early record label, the first company to produce disc 'gramophone records' pictured playing on this intricate gramophone (left) and a version of the 1887 blueprint for an old camera pictured right

The ingenious structure of the Wright brothers' flying machine (pictured) was patented in 1906 by the two American aviation pioneers who built the world's first successful airplane and made the first controlled and powered human flight in a machine heavier than air, in 1903

There have been many tweaks to bicycle design over the years, but this blueprint of the velocipede (pictured left), patented in 1890 still has classic appeal. The yo-yo was patented in 1866 and was first made popular in the 1920s but it was first invented in ancient Greece

Harley Davidson Inc was founded in the first decade of the 20th century and was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression. The motorcycles (pictured) are known for the tradition of heavy customisation that gave rise to the 'chopper' style of motorcycle

It is hard to believe that Apple's first personal compute, which was patented in 1983, (pictured left) led to the development of the company's super slim offerings like the iPad and MacBook Air today.  The blueprint for an elaborate cash register with beautiful art nouveau style detailing is pictured on the right
