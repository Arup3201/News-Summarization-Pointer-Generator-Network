Arjen Robben might have left Sergio Ramos looking stupid as he outpaced the Real Madrid centre back in Holland's 5-1 win over Spain, but Croatia's Darijo Srna has gone one better to be crowned the world's fastest footballer.

And at the age of 32, the Croat full back's record-breaking sprint left Robben's run looking sluggish as he clocked a speed of almost 20.5mph in his side's 4-0 win over Cameroon.

The Shakhtar Donetsk right back surprised everyone with his pace-setter - one of 31 sprints he recorded, revealed in records from the Group A game released by FIFA.

Stats don't lie: FIFA's records show that Srna clocked in a 32.98km/h sprint against Cameroon

While Robben recorded an impressive top speed of 19.3mph, Srna beat the Dutch wing wizard with a sprint that would leave him a whole two kilometres further forward if recorded over an hour-long run, hitting 20.5mph.

The Croatian captain revealed earlier this year that he turned down the chance to join Chelsea and Bayern Munich to stay with the Ukrainian champions.

Croatia beat Cameroon 4-0 on Wednesday to give themselves a good chance of qualifying from Group A alongside host nation Brazil.
