North Korea has issued yet another set of apocalyptic threats as the rogue state refuses to back down in the face of war games between the U.S. and South Korea.

An official newspaper has quoted a war veteran vowing to 'rain bullets on the enemy' while leader Kim Jong Un urged his troops to 'cut their windpipes'.

The 20-something leader has been seen looking increasingly warlike in recent pictures posing next to tanks and guns, prompting speculation he is trying to project a 'hard man' image to shore up his authority ahead of a possible new offensive.

Hard man: Over the past couple of days Kim appears to have projected a tougher image

North Korea's army this week officially cancelled an armistice it signed with the South at the end of Korean War.

The move makes it more likely that recent tensions, prompted by new UN sanctions as well as the joint military exercises which started yesterday, could bubble over into all-out warfare.

Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of Kim's Workers' Party, quoted an 80-year-old veteran of the Korean War supposedly expressed the national mood.

'I am still keeping a bullet that I failed to fire at a trench in the 1950s because the U.S. imperialists and their stooges signed an armistice agreement,' he apparently said.

'Send me to the trench. Give me a rifle. I want to rain bullets on the enemy to my heart's content.'

Kim himself issued a direct threat to the U.S. and South Korea over their long-scheduled drills on the Korean Peninsula.

'As
 the saying goes, a guy who is fond of playing with fire is bound to 
perish in flames,' he told troops. 'All the enemies quite often playing 
with fire in the sensitive hotspot should be thrown into a cauldron once
 I issue an order.

'Once
 an order is issued you should break the waists of the crazy enemies, 
totally cut their windpipes and thus clearly show them what a real war 
is like.'

The leader's 
martial attitude in recent photographs is in stark contrast to the 
laid-back image he attempted to project during the recent visit of 
former basketball star Dennis Rodman to the pariah nation.

Pictures from that visit showed him laughing along with his guest at a sports match and hosting the star at a lavish banquet.

After the start of the military 
drills yesterday, South Korean officials said their northern 
counterparts did not answer two calls on a hotline between the sides, 
apparently following through on an earlier vow to cut the communication 
channel because of the drills.

Pyongyang
 has launched a bombast-filled propaganda campaign against the drills, 
which involve 10,000 South Korean and about 3,000 American troops, and 
last week's UN vote to impose new sanctions over the North's February 12
 nuclear test.

Pyongyang
 isn't believed to be able to build a warhead small enough to mount on a
 long-range missile, and the North's military has repeatedly vowed in 
the past to scrap the 1953 armistice.

North
 Korea wants a formal peace treaty, security guarantees and other 
concessions, as well as the removal of 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in 
South Korea.

South Korean and U.S. officials have been closely monitoring Pyongyang's actions and parsing the torrent of recent rhetoric from the North, which has been more warlike than usual.

North Korea regularly claims South 
Korea-U.S. drills are a preparation for invasion, but Pyongyang has 
signaled more worry about the drills that began Monday.

The drills follow UN sanctions that the North says are the result of U.S. hostility aimed at toppling its political system.

North
 Korea has also warned South Korea of a nuclear war on the divided 
peninsula and said it was cancelling nonaggression pacts.

Under
 newly inaugurated President Park Geun-hye, South Korea's defence 
ministry, which often brushes off North Korean threats, has looked to 
send a message of strength in response to the latest threats.

The
 ministry warned on Friday that the North's government would 'evaporate 
from the face of the Earth' if it ever used a nuclear weapon.

The White House also said the U.S. is fully capable of defending itself against a North Korean ballistic attack.

North Korea has said the U.S. mainland is within the range of its long-range missiles, and an army general told a Pyongyang rally last week that the military is ready to fire a long-range nuclear-armed missile to turn Washington into a 'sea of fire.'

While outside scientists are still trying to determine specifics, the North's rocket test in December and third atomic bomb test last month may have pushed the country a step closer to acquiring the ability to hit the U.S. with weapons of mass destruction.

Analysts, however, say Pyongyang is still years away from acquiring the smaller, lighter nuclear warheads needed for a credible nuclear missile program.

But there are still worries about a smaller conflict. North Korea has a variety of missiles and other weapons capable of striking South Korea.

In 2010, North Korea shelled a South Korean island and allegedly torpedoed a South Korean warship, killing a total of 50 South Koreans.

Both incidents occurred near the disputed western sea boundary, a recurring flashpoint between the Koreas that has seen three other bloody naval skirmishes since 1999.

Kim Jong Un visited two islands just north of the sea boundary last week and ordered troops there to open fire immediately if a single enemy shell is fired on North Korean waters.

Kim was also quoted as saying his military is fully ready to fight an 'all-out war' and that he will order a 'just, great advance for national unification' if the enemy makes even a slight provocation, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency.Â
