These stunning black-and-white photographs taken over 150 years ago helped to persuade US President Abraham Lincoln to preserve California’s Yosemite Valley.

While today’s visitors snap thousands of digital images with ease or pose for playful smartphone selfies, photographer Carleton Watkins had to trek through the valley with a team of mules, a large camera and a mobile darkroom.

He captured the breath-taking scenes in 1861 at a time when Yosemite Valley, around 175 miles east of San Francisco, was an unprotected beauty spot in the young state of California.

Today, Yosemite Valley is part of an iconic national park that lures over 3.5m visitors a year.

Mr Watkins travelled deep into the valley through difficult terrain to create 18-by-22-inch glass-plate negatives – the images later shown to President Lincoln.

The glacial valley in the Sierra Nevada mountains is famous for its waterfalls, Tunnel View scenic overlook and El Capitan vertical rock formation.

In awe of the valley's beauty, President Lincoln signed the Yosemite Grant Act in 1864 after it was approved by the Senate and House of Representatives.

The act preserved the land for public use, helping pave the way for America's National Park System.

This year, the National Park Service celebrates its 100th anniversary, and the Yosemite Valley Grant its 150th anniversary.

To celebrate, Watkins' works have been showcased at Stanford University's Cantor Arts Center, where more than 80 original prints were on display.
