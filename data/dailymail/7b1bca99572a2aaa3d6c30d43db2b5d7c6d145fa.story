Consumer groups and an MP are demanding a police inquiry into Wonga after evidence emerged it sent bullying letters from fake law firms to threaten customers who were behind on repayments.

Britain’s biggest payday lender was yesterday named and shamed by a City watchdog, which ordered it to pay more than £2.6million in compensation to 45,000 customers who received the bogus letters.

But consumer groups say there is clear evidence of a criminal deception and insist the police should be brought in.

Wonga has been slammed for pressurising indebted to customers  by sending letters from fake law firms

Wonga could be investigated for a string of criminal offences, from fraud to falsely impersonating a solicitor and even blackmail, says lawyer Dan Bunting.

It is a crime under the Fraud Act to dishonestly make a false representation, intending to make a gain or cause a loss to another, when you know it is false and misleading.

The Solicitors Act of 1974 makes it an offence for someone to falsely claim to be a solicitor –  although there is usually a six month time limit from the date of this particular offence.

Wonga could also be charged with blackmail under section 21 of the Theft Act 1968 – as a threat to take people to court could be regarded as ‘an unwarranted demand with menaces’.

Mr Bunting said: ‘So, whilst “blackmail” conjures up connotations of masked men making a ransom demand after a kidnapping, this may well be close.’

Shadow consumer affairs minister Stella 
Creasy called for a police investigation of Wonga saying: ‘Aside from 
potential fraud, harassment of a debtor is a criminal offence.’

The MP pointed out that it is also an offence to pretend to be a lawyer under the 1974 Solicitors Act.

She
 added: ‘News that Wonga was sending fake solicitor letters to 
cash-strapped customers who couldn’t afford their fees to frighten them –
 and charging them for these – is further proof of the need for Britain 
to rid itself of these legal loan sharks.’

While the company 
presents itself as the ethical face of the payday loans industry with 
its friendly TV ad puppets, an investigation by the Financial Conduct 
Authority found extensive evidence of ‘thuggish’ behaviour.

Among 
Wonga’s victims threatened by the fake legal team was a woman who missed
 repayments because she was in hospital recovering from a miscarriage.

The
 FCA said Wonga sent letters to customers in arrears from what appeared 
to be two law firms, called ‘Chainey, D’Amato & Shannon’ and ‘Barker
 and Lowe Legal Recoveries’ – but these two companies were invented by 
Wonga to put pressure on customers.

In some cases extra charges were added to the outstanding debt to cover the cost of sending these threatening letters.

Despite
 the damning evidence, the watchdog added that £2.6million is the 
biggest compensation order it can impose on Wonga – because the 
wrongdoing occurred before tougher laws were implemented last year.

Consumer
 Action Group founder Marc Gander said: ‘It seems to me that this was a 
criminal deception. Wonga was inventing lawyers and making demands for 
charges. I am amazed that there is no substantial fine or criminal 
investigation.

‘I don’t think the FCA needs to look very far to find 
evidence of laws that have been broken, the real problem is that they do
 not seem to have the will or the courage.’

 Clive Adamson, director 
of supervision at the FCA, said: ‘Wonga’s misconduct was very serious 
because it had the effect of exacerbating an already difficult situation
 for customers in arrears.

‘The FCA expects firms to pay particular 
attention to fair treatment of those who have difficulty in meeting 
their loan repayments.’

The £2.6million of redress covers a flat 
compensation payout of £50 for each of the 45,000 customers who were 
targeted between 2008 and 2010. Some will also get refunds of charges 
that were unfairly applied.

However, this represents a tiny figure in
 the context of the company’s profits, which are estimated at more than 
£100million a year on the back of making more than four million loans a 
year to more than one million customers.

One of the company’s two 
founders, Errol Damelin, who was chief executive at the time the 
threatening letters were being sent, stepped down from his post as 
chairman just two weeks ago in what appears to have been a damage 
limitation exercise.

Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com 
joined in the attack: ‘This just shows that while Wonga hires expensive 
marketing, PR and public affairs consultants to try to position itself 
as the good guys in a bad industry, it’s all a sham.

‘Using lawyers 
as fake as its puppets, then having the stomach to charge people for it 
is a thuggish tactic, aimed at scaring and intimidating people already 
struggling.’

The firm’s interim chief executive, Tim Weller, said: 
‘We would like to apologise unreservedly to anyone affected by the 
historical debt collection activity and for any distress caused as a 
result.

'The practice was unacceptable and we voluntarily ceased it 
nearly four years ago.’

An order to pay £2.6million in compensation is little more than pocket money to Wonga and its multi-millionaire founders.

Errol Damelin and Jonty Hurwitz set up what is now Britain’s biggest payday loan company in 2007 and within two years had raised £14million from City investors.

Today, the two enjoy luxury homes and lifestyles with Mr Damelin’s personal fortune estimated at more than £34million, while Mr Hurwitz is said to be over £25million.

Their wealth has been built on the back of families who have struggled for cash during a six-year cost-of-living squeeze, during which time the firm has also attracted many critics.

Mr Damelin, 44, originally from South Africa, started his first company in Israel and became an investment banker on arrival in the UK.

He was already a wealthy man when his family set up home in a six-bedroom house in Hampstead, North London, in 2002.

The house was bought for some £580,000 and is worth at least four times that figure today. As the business grew, Mr Damelin reportedly paid himself more than £1million a year while cosying up to City investors who have ploughed a total of £100million into the loans colossus.

While Wonga has been happy to send threatening letters to customers, the businessman has claimed the loans it provides are force for good. He said in 2012: ‘Credit in consumer society is absolutely critical. Without it, you have no social mobility...wealthy people will stay wealthy.’

Despite his financial successes, Mr Damelin has suffered failure in his personal life and it emerged last year that he was splitting from his wife Julie, the mother of their three children, after 15 years of marriage.

Like his partner, Jonty Hurwitz, 44, also originates from South Africa. His background was in technology and he is credited with developing the software that assesses customers on the Wonga site, but now he has stepped back from managing Wonga and likes to see himself as an artist and web entrepreneur.

He married Chloe Lander, a 41-year-old violinist, in 2001 and five years later bought a £950,000 home on the border of  Surrey and West Sussex in order to pursue a leisurely life as a sculptor.

Writing about Wonga, he boasted of having been the ‘thinker, the designer, the visionary’ in the ‘glorious moment’ when the company began trading. His art, he says, is a way to ‘allow my ego to feel fantastic’.
