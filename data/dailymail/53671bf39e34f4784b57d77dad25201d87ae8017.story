A host of hopeless artworks were today unveiled as the entries for this year's 'Turnip Prize' - a spoof competition inspired by the world-famous Turner Prize which annually celebrates Britain's best visual artist.

The Turnip Prize however encourages art that showcases a complete lack of talent, inspiration or effort.

The ten-year-old competition will this year be held at the New Inn in Wedmore, Somerset.

'Egg on Rooney': The competition, organised by a Somerset pub landlord, welcomes entries that demonstrate lack of artistic genius and effort

'Phone hacking': A hack saw slicing through a mobile phone is one entrant's artistic way of commenting on current affairs

'Chip and Pin': Entrants think up tongue-in-cheek creations in a bid to 'take the mick' out of the prestigious Turner Prize which celebrates visual artists

'Play on Words': Between 50 and 60 people have entered this year's competition with quirky pieces of 'artwork'

Landlady Debbie Noon said: 'It's been running for a while, we've had it in our pub now for about six or seven years.

'At the moment there are around 50-60 entries, though tonight is the deadline for entering,' added Ms Noon, who runs the pub with her partner, Frank Sparks.

The 52-year-old doesn't take a hand in judging the competition however, leaving it up to the previous year's winner among other guests of honour such as Trevor Prideux, the competition's organiser.

'It is a bit of a laugh, we do have good fun.

'Sometimes local TV stations join us and there are always people ringing up in the week of the competition asking about it,' she said.

'Just A Jif' and 'Two Bit Tarts' are among the entries that will be whittled down to around ten when preliminary judging begins at the pub on Sunday

'Couch Potato' is created from a holed out potato on wooden legs while 'Fifty Shades of Che' makes reference to the popular erotic novel by E.L. James

'Hair of the dog' and 'Wookie the hole' were other entries in the competition. The landlady of the pub where the contest is held said participants and customers haveÂ  'good time' when the winner is announced every year

Among the entries this year is a work titled 'Egon Ronay' - a tribute to the celebrated food critic which consists of a picture of Wayne Rooney with an egg on top.

Others include 'Chip and Pin' which is made of a potato chip with a drawing pin through it, and 'Smartie Pants' - a pair of pants with a tube of smarties attached.

More controversial entries included a mobile phone with a hack saw through it entitled 'Phone Hacking'.

The coveted first prize is a turnip impaled on a rusty nail, to 'take the mick' out of the prestigious Turner Prize.

Last year's victor, Sarah Quick, will be tasked with handing over the vegetable to the new winner when they are crowned on December 2.
