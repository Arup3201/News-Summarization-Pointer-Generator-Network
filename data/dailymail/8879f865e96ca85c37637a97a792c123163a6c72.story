Dress to impress: Unemployed Palmer, 26, dressed up in court on Friday after leaving her children alone as she went clubbing

She dressed like a would-be footballer’s wife, with ever-present fake tan and designer handbags – even on the school run.

Yet Laura Palmer’s ostentatiously glamorous image was in sickening contrast to the squalor in which she left her children, a court heard.

Her three boys, aged three, four and seven, were left unsupervised for hours in their filthy house as she went out drinking.

Neighbours even found the youngsters playing naked in the street after she left them alone to go out with friends.

On that occasion, the 26-year-old returned home in the morning to find police at the scene and was later discovered hiding in the garden shed, still wearing her clubbing outfit.

Palmer admitted three charges of child cruelty and neglect at Hull Crown Court.

Recorder Paul Miller gave her a ‘constructive’ 12-month supervision order, instead of a prison term, ‘so that nothing like this will ever happen again’.

The judge told her the children were left in a ‘disgusting’ house and that ‘anything could have happened to them’ when she was out.

He added: ‘In the future put your children first – not having a good time.’

The court heard that while Palmer, a former care worker, was always dressed up, she forced her children to live in ‘uninhabitable’ squalor.

Her house was left in a ‘vile state’.  Decaying food and human excrement covered the floors of the semi in Hull and even the bath was full of rubbish.

Appearing in court in full make-up and wearing a pink dress with matching pink shoes, Palmer listened as prosecutor Nick Adlington outlined the shocking circumstances of the case.

Palmer left her three boys home alone at 11.30pm on June 13 last year after putting them to bed.

The
next morning the children climbed out of a window and were seen playing
naked in the street with a scooter near fast-moving traffic at 9.30am.

Numerous neighbours, motorists and passers-by rang the police, the court heard.

Officers arrived and took the youngsters, who were covered in filth, back to the house, gaining access through a window.

‘It was in a terrible state, covered in excrement and dirt and the children could access dangerous areas of the house including the kitchen,’ said Mr Adlington.

‘Officers described the house as being in a vile state.’ He said there was ‘a general air of neglect’ with food all over the living room and no bedding on some of the beds.

‘The defendant was, in due course, found in the garden shed intoxicated having been out the night before and was still dressed for a night out.’

Palmer, who has two cautions for shoplifting and is now jobless, claimed she had fallen asleep on a friend’s sofa and later told police: ‘I have never done it before. I’m devastated. There’s no excuse. I just lost the plot and gave up on the house. Everything was a total tip. I was expecting to be rehoused.’

Social worker Jacqueline Feeney described the house as ‘uninhabitable for children’. She said conditions had become worse since her previous visit a month earlier.

Neighbours said Palmer had been living alone with the three children after splitting up with her partner about six months earlier.

He was described as a ‘good father’ and conditions inside deteriorated after he left. The young children were regularly seen ‘hanging dangerously out of first floor windows’.

One neighbour said she suspected the children were being neglected as ‘I never saw washing on the line and never smelt food cooking’.

‘She told me she had a job as a care worker and I thought, “What is she doing caring for other people when she can’t care for her children?”,’ she said.

‘I believe she left them alone regularly. Certainly any money she had was spent on herself. All her clothes looked designer to me, she was always dressed up to the nines, with false tans and perfect nails. She took the kids to school glammed up.’

The neighbour said her husband had used a ladder to look inside the house after the incident and was horrified by what he saw. ‘They lived in absolute and total squalor,’ she said.
