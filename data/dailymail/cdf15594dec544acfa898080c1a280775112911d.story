Brazil's 1974 World Cup win over Zaire wasn't remembered as a straight-forward 3-0 win when, five minutes from time, right-back Mwepu Ilunga charged towards the stationary ball and booted it upfield.

The Zairian went down in history as fans, commentators and players alike were left baffled as to why Ilunga decided to put his laces through the ball.

And now the Czech First League has its own version after Zbrojovka Brno, defending a free-kick against Banik Ostrava, saw their players rush from the wall and intercept the unmoving ball.

VIDEO Scroll down to see Czech defender recreate the infamous 1974 World Cup free-kick

Ready: The wall is set by the referee in the Czech First League tie between Zbrojovka Brno and Banik Ostrava

Escape: A Brno player charges from the wall towards the static ball as the Banik players look amazed

Appeal: Banik look to the referee for the infringement but play is allowed to carry on as Brno attack

He's away: Brno start a counter-attack while Banik players look towards the referee for a little help

Counter: A four-on-two attack emerges from the bizarre free-kick that replicates Brazil vs Zaire in 1974

But unlike Ilunga 40 years ago, Brno decided to create a counter-attack and nearly scored as a result as the referee allowed play to continue.

Banik wound up winning the match 1-0, but it will be remembered more for the bizarre interception.

The referee can only have suspected Banik touched the ball before the free-kick was struck. Either way, it makes for strange viewing from the Synot Liga.
