Luke Shaw is hoping to make his Manchester United debut this weekend against QPR after recovering from a hamstring injury.

Shaw joined Manchester United for £31.5million in the summer from Southampton – but has yet to play a competitive game for his new club.

The England international was put on a special training programme after returning from the World Cup by new manager Louis van Gaal who claimed he was not at the right fitness level.

Ready for action: Luke Shaw is in contention to make his Manchester United debut against QPR

Getting fit: Shaw is believed to be back in full training after being sidelined for a month 

Shaw did feature for United in their pre-season tour of America but has been out of action for the last month with the hamstring problem.

The 19-year-old has now returned to full training with United and could make his Old Trafford bow alongside fellow new signings Daley Blind and Radamel Falcao who joined the club on transfer deadline day.
