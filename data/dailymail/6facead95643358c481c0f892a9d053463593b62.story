There are more super-rich people living in London than in any other city around the world, a report into the habits of the global elite reveals today.

The report, from the estate agency Knight Frank, said around 4,200 people live in the capital who are defined as ‘ultra high net worth individuals’.

To qualify, a person must have at least £18million in net assets, excluding the value of their main home, although it could include the value of their other homes.

On the up: Some parts of London have experienced explosive growth in popularity

A typical ‘ultra high net worth 
individual’ has 2.4 homes, such as a home in a city and one in the 
countryside, while many also have a home by the sea and a property in a 
ski resort.

Overall, 
Knight Frank’s authoritative ‘Wealth Report’ says there are 4,224 
super-rich people in London, which significantly overshadows the 
population in any other city.

By comparison, Melbourne has 445, Oslo has 470, Milan has 235, Dublin has 365 and Berlin has 464.

Tokyo, which comes second to London for the number of super-rich residents, has 3,525, followed by Singapore with 3,154.

The
 report predicts London will remain top of the premier league of 
super-rich people over the next decade, with the numbers set to rise by 
nearly 20 per cent over the next decade.

By 2023, it expects the capital’s population of super-rich will be just short of 5,000 people.

In the shade: New York is lagging behind London as well as giant Asian cities

It states: ‘Globally, the UK is considered the number one destination for those seeking a new domicile, although American is still more popular with the super-rich from Asia.’

Knight Frank's Liam Bailey attributed London's success to its cosmopolitan reputation and status as a hub for the wealthy from all sorts of different places.

'London wins over New York,' he told the Guardian. 'It's more diverse. There are more nationalities living here and it's a more global city.'

However, Asian cities are set to overtake the West in future years, with places such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing competing to become Asia's top hub.

Despite the ravages of the financial crisis and global recession, the number of the super-wealthy around the world is expected to increase at a sharp pace.

There are set to be 30 per cent more people with at least £18million in assets by 2023 - and in Africa, the number is forecast to double over the decade.

Soaring: Since the depths of the financial crisis, London's 'prime' property prices have risen 50 per cent

The consequence of London’s popularity is the crippling cost of a home in the capital.

A home in the most exclusive area, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, costs an average of £1.2million, according to the Land Registry.

1) London - 4,224 'ultra high net worth individuals'

2) Tokyo - 3,525

3) Singapore - 3,154

4) New York - 2,929

5) Hong Kong - 2,560

A decade ago, the same home would have cost £490,000.

Knight Frank examined what you could buy in cities around the world for $1million (around £600,00).

In ‘prime’ London, you could buy just 25.2 square metres, which is the equivalent of just a double bedroom. London is beaten only by Monaco and Hong Kong which are even more expensive.

Of the 20 cities which were investigated, property is cheapest in Cape Town where $1million would usually buy a 215 square metre home with five double bedrooms.

Knight Frank's report suggests a number of factors which could transform the international property market - including the tantalising possibility of sub-orbital space flight.

These flights, which could allow the ultra-rich to travel from London to Sydney in just two hours, would help far-flung areas at the expense of more centrally located regions such as western Europe.
