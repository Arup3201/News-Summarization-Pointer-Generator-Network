Film director Richard Attenborough has moved into a care home with his wife because of his failing health.

The 89-year-old, who won eight Oscars for his 1982 epic Gandhi, has been confined to a wheelchair since suffering a stroke five years ago.

But he has now become too unwell to care for himself and has joined his wife, actress Sheila Sim, in a specialist charity care home for elderly or sick entertainers in west London.

The couple have sold their home, in 
Richmond upon Thames, south-west London, for £11.5million. The 
director’s brother, naturalist Sir David Attenborough, 86, said it 
‘simply wasn’t practical’ for them to keep it.

Lord Attenborough’s son Michael, 63, added: ‘The truth is that for over 15 months my mother and father have been living in a home for elderly people specifically from the theatrical profession, which my parents helped to run for many years.

'As a consequence, they recently sold their Richmond home.'

Lord Attenborough spent several days in a coma after his stroke in 2008.
 He joked at the time: ‘I scared the living daylights out of Sheila, had
 some time in hospital. They were all fussing around.’

But his family said he has never fully recovered and continues to struggle to communicate and move around.

Describing the accident in a 2011 
interview, Sir David said: ‘He fell downstairs and damaged his brain, so
 was unconscious for a long time. He’s now back, but he’s in a 
wheelchair.’

‘You can have a conversation with 
him. I go down and see him at the weekend. We have our jokes, the ones 
we’ve had since we were kids.’

The couple met at the Royal Academy of
 Dramatic Art in London when they co-starred in a production of The Lady
 With The Lamp. Lord Attenborough later recalled: ‘I had the lead male 
role opposite three Florence Nightingales.

One of them was a girl called Sheila Sim – she was stunningly attractive, without any airs or graces.

Over rehearsals we got to know each other and embarked on an old-fashioned courtship.

‘Until I asked her recently, I 
couldn’t remember how or when I asked Sheila to marry me. She informed 
me that while we were at Rada I’d asked every day, first thing in the 
morning.

‘But we both knew we were playing a 
game and it was far too early to settle down.’ He added: ‘Both our 
careers took off in the immediate post-war years as the whole population
 went crazy over a crop of young film stars.

‘It wasn’t to do with acting or 
talent. We just happened to be in the right place at a time when the 
public wanted an escape from years of austerity.’

He went on to enjoy a hugely 
successful career as an actor and director, gathering 74 acting credits 
after appearing in 1942 war film In Which We Serve, directed by Noel 
Coward.

He also starred in Jurassic Park, Miracle on 34th Street, Elizabeth, Brighton Rock and Flight of the Phoenix.

He made his directorial debut with 
1969 musical Oh! What a Lovely War, following it up with Oscar-winning 
epic Gandhi in 1982. His 1987 film Cry Freedom, starring Denzel 
Washington, told the story of anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko.

During the Second World War, Lord 
Attenborough served with the Royal Air Force, and was seconded to the 
newly-formed RAF film unit at Pinewood Studios after initial pilot 
training.

He appeared in the 1943 propaganda 
film Journey Together before qualifying as a sergeant and flying on 
missions all over Europe filming the outcome of Bomber Command sorties.

He and Miss Sim, who married in 1945, co-starred in the original West End production of Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap in 1952.

They had a son and two daughters, but
 their elder daughter Jane and her daughter Lucy were killed in the 
South Asian tsunami on Boxing Day in 2004.
