Fighting back: Karen Mooney is considering taking legal action

A high-flying businesswoman may sue cosmetics firm Clarins after red sores broke out all over her face when she used its expensive beauty products.

Karen Mooney, 52, discovered she had an allergy to methylisothiazolinone (MI), a preservative in the Clarins creams.

She is among the latest victims of what dermatologists say is an epidemic of allergies caused by the compound.

Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed experts are calling for an immediate ban on MI.Doctors at St Thomas’ Hospital in London blame the compound for a massive surge in patients with skin problems.

Karen’s skin began breaking out in welts after regularly using Clarins products, such as the Lait Demaquillant Cleansing Milk and Extra-Firming Day Cream.

The dating agency boss from Surrey had been using Clarins products for cleansing and moisturising for two decades.

She said: ‘I’ve always had really healthy skin so I was terrified by the sores and made an appointment to see my GP. I assumed it was stress. My doctor agreed.’

The doctor prescribed hydrocortisone cream but it made no difference. Two months later the welts were so painful she couldn’t cover them with make-up.

Finally Karen saw Dr Olivia O’Gorman-Lalor, a consultant  dermatologist at Ashford and St Peters Hospital in Surrey.

Tests found Karen had a severe allergic reaction to MI and to Clarins’ Lait Demaquillant.

Karen’s allergic reaction came as no surprise to Dr O’Gorman-Lalor. She said: ‘I’ve seen more and more cases like these in the past two years. The general feeling is that it’s due to MI being used more widely and at higher concentrations.’

Karen now avoids MI and her condition is under control, but she struggles to find MI-free products. She says: ‘I have to be incredibly careful.

‘It’s hard because the same preservative is called by many different names. It’s in so many things it’s difficult to avoid – I’ve only found two shampoos without it and can’t find a suntan lotion so have to stay out of the sun.’

The preservative was first approved for use in skincare in 2005. Two studies presented at the British Association of Dermatologists’ conference last week showed a sharp rise in reactions to MI over the past three years.

Consultant dermatologist Dr John McFadden said: ‘This is one of the worst outbreaks I have ever seen. There hasn’t been anything on this scale before. We just don’t know when it will peak.’ 

Manufacturers have ignored calls for immediate action, but legal experts warn they could become liable for compensation claims.

The Cosmetic Toiletry and Perfumery Association – the trade association representing UK manufacturers – this week met dermatologists to ‘plan further meetings to discuss the most appropriate step to undertake’.

But Clarins dismissed concerns, claiming that cases of MI allergy are isolated. A spokesman said: ‘It is inevitable that someone, somewhere will be unable to tolerate a particular ingredient or combination of ingredients within a product formula.’

The company insists its ingredients are approved by the European Commission and its safety is reviewed by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety. Clarins would not, however, confirm whether it had recently changed its formulations to include MI.
