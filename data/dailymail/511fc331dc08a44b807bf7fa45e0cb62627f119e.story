Chicago is once again the hub of American travel, according to new data released by the Federal Aviation Administration.

The Windy City's O'Hare International Airport reported the highest number of flights of any U.S. airport for the year of 2014, despite a slight decrease in travel at the airport. 

But because it's main competitor, Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, suffered an even greater loss in traffic, Chicago won back the title of highest-trafficked airport - an honor it lost to the southern city in 2005.

Busy, busy: Chicago's O'Hare International Airport is again the most highly-trafficked airport according to new data released by the FAA

However, O'Hare doesn't have that much of an edge over Atlanta. Atlanta is expected to maintain the highest total passenger count when those figures are released later this year. 

The Chicago Sun-Times said that these numbers are 'the traditional yardstick by which the title of "world's busiest" has to be bestowed'. 

One reason that Chicago traffic is up this year is because O'Hare and Midway airports have added six new international airlines servicing dozens of destination in the last 18 months, city officials said.
