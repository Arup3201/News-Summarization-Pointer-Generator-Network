It may look like a set of incredible close-up photographs of exotic wildlife and nature – but these pictures actually feature people who have been cleverly painted from head to toe before strategically posing for the spectacular shots.

The astonishingly detailed artworks have been created by the world’s number one body painter, Johannes Stoetter.

The 35-year-old artist, who lives in Italy, used five people to recreate the lifelike tropical tree frog – which has quickly become one his most impressive creations.

The fine-art painter spends up to five months painstakingly planning and perfecting each one of his amazing creations.

Each work of art then takes up to eight hours to complete using special breathable paint.

The stunning creations, which include fruit made from painted heads, have earned Johannes the World Body Painting Champion title.

Mr Stoetter used five people to recreate this lifelike tropical tree frog. One person can be seen in the centre, acting as the frog's backbone, while two others can be seen crouched on the floor, acting as the frog's back legs. Two others are sat upright either side of the 'backbone' with their arms and hands strategically placed to replicate the front legs

The 35-year-old artist, who lives in Italy, plays tricks with the mind thanks to his incredible talent for body art in which he makes his subjects disappear into their backgrounds. Here, the centre pineapple - which is a person's painted head, is almost a replica of the fruits either side

Mr Stoetta was crowned the World Body Painting Champion in 2012 after spending years demonstrating his incredible talent for including intricate detailing when painting human bodies. In his latest set of pictures his artworks replicate exotic nature and wildlife shots

Mr Stoetter, from South Tyrol in Italy, said: 'I did my first body painting experiment in 2000. Five years earlier I had the idea to paint a human body but it took me until I was 23 to try it'

The incredible artworks created by Mr Stoetta are mind-blowing and demonstrate the intricate and painstaking attention to detail he applies to each of his creations

Mr Stoetter, who first started body painting in 2000, said: 'The experience was so special that I wanted to do it again immediately - I wanted to try it with different colours, a different model and a different motive'

Mr Stoetter, pictured, who lives in Italy, dedicates his life to creating the extraordinary masterpieces which take up to five months to plan and create. The 35-year-old lives in Italy and says friends are often astounded at his clever creations
