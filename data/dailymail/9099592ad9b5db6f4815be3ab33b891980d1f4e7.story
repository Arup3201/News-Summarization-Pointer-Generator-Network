Former Pakistan cricket star Imran Khan said aid money was being used to make the wealthy wealthier

British aid money is being used to line the pockets of wealthy Pakistanis with links to the country's corrupt regime, minsters have been warned.

Former cricket star Imran Khan said Pakistani politicians were syphoning off cash from the multi-million pound budget handed over by the Department for International Development.

Mr Khan, head of Pakistan's Tehreek-e-Insaf opposition party, said the cash was going to those who did not need it and 'never reaches' deserving people.

The remaks, to the Sun on Sunday newspaper, come after a report revealed aid spending had done nothing to help the economic and political freedoms of people in the countries which get the cash.

It examined the progress of 28 countries which have had a share of the aid financed by British taxpayers and found that the money 'does not have any discernible impact on freedom in developing countries'.

The report produced by the TaxPayers' Alliance found that twice as many countries lost freedoms after receiving British aid than improved the political and human rights conditions for their citizens.

Mr Khan's remarks are likely to further deepen suspicion of aid spending among Tory right-wingers who are unconvinced by David Cameron's commitment to increasing the aid budget to 0.7 per cent of gross national income.

The pledge pushed aid spending close to £12billion last year and means further sharp increases over the next few years.

The Prime Minister has given his personal support to a LibDem-backed private member's bill which would write the 0.7 per cent target into law – a decision which means Mr Cameron faces the prospect of seeing many of his backbenchers vote against him.

Pakistan is one of the biggest recipients of UK aid. Up to £310million is being handed over in the next year, dwarfing last year's £253million.

But Mr Khan warned that in Pakistan, corrupt politicians 'have made millions through kickbacks'. The country is rated 37th out of 174 countries on the corruption index.

The former cricket star told the Sun on Sunday: 'They are filling their own pockets. DFID and others have played a big role for us but the money has to be used honestly. The British Government and other donors must have a major say in the implementation of proposed projects.

'When I say the DFID money is misused, I mean our system is not using it rightly. The money must be used for welfare projects rather than making billionaires even more rich.'

Thousands of Pakistanis took to the streets this year calling for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to step down amid anger over corruption. But Mr Sharif's government continues to receive millions of pounds in UK aid money

Mr Khan added: 'This is the most corrupt government we have ever had so whatever they get from donors they will try to distribute among their family members or favourites.

'We want more schools, hospitals, small businesses and employment opportunities. This government has to go if we want any change.

'Otherwise the money provided by the DFID and others will only help the rulers and never reach deserving people. They even bribe the media with this money.'

Billionaire Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is facing accusations he stole from public coffers, while former president Asif Ali Zardari was twice jailed for corruption — yet remains Pakistan's second-richest person.

Less than one per cent of the population pays income tax and only 30 per cent of MPs contribute.

A DFID spokesman said Mr Khan's allegations were 'unfounded'. He said: 'Strict financial checks and close monitoring mean aid money only goes to those who need it.

'UK aid is changing Pakistan for the better — for example, 400,000 girls in the Khyber Pakhtunkwa region alone can now go to school because of it.

'Ultimately, this work is in Britain's interest. A thriving, stable Pakistan will help safeguard against terrorism and be a trading partner for the future.'
