Queens Park rangers want to sign Leicester full-back Ritchie de Laet. 

The 25-year-old was a target for Harry Redknapp in the summer and the QPR boss is ready to resume his pursuit in January. 

De Laet, formerly of Manchester United and Stoke, has started the season well at Leicester after Nigel Pearson signed Danny Simpson from QPR to increase competition at full-back.

Meanwhile, Redknapp has told Adel Taarabt to reduce weight and get fit if he wants to become a Barclays Premier League star.

Redknapp said: ‘He’s twisted his ankle, it’s sore again, so we’re back to square one with him. We just can’t get him fit.

‘It’s difficult, he keeps trying to come back and it goes again. Do you rest him for a few weeks? But then while he’s resting, is he going to put on weight? How’re you going to get him fit? It’s such a difficult job with him.
