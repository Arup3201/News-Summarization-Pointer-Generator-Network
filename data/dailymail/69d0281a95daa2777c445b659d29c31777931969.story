When Su Guiying placed a heartrending little note in her local paper asking for people to turn up at her funeral when she died, little did she know how it would change her life.

The 90-year-old, who tragically lost all of her 17 children shortly after they were born or while they were still young, has finally been gifted the family she always craved after dozens of people decided they didn't want to wait for her funeral to show they cared.

Used to spending the New Year festival alone, all of a sudden Su's home in the village of Hongxia on the outskirts of Ruichang City in southern China's Jiangxi province, was overrun with well-wishers touched by her lonely plea.

A meal to savour: The 90-year-old is having food made for her for New Year for the first time in 40 years

Allow me: Dozens of well-wishers have arrived at Su's home in Hongxia on the outskirts of Ruichang City

A friendly face: the village in China's Jiangxi province has been overrun with strangers touched by Su's plea

All smiles: Su has already enjoyed one feast (right) before the actual day of Chinese New Year this Thursday

She was so overcome at the attention after years of isolation that, with the day itself fast approaching on February 19, she burst into tears and declared it already the best New Year's festival she has ever had.

Su said: 'I married when I was young, just 17, but I lost my first two children and then my husband abandoned me saying I was unlucky.

'Then I remarried but the next nine children which I had almost every year died at birth or not so long after. 

'My second husband died when I was 33. But I married a third time and we had six children together, though I stopped hoping after that about having a family. 

'My child who lived the longest was aged three when he died, it broke my heart. I lost all the children and then my third husband died.'

Desperate and alone, she adopted a girl at the age of two, but when the girl was 19 years old she tracked down her original parents, a wealthy couple from the Chinese capital Beijing, and left Su never to return.

For the last 40 years since then she has lived on her own with no immediate family or friends but when her sad story was published in the run up to Chinese New Year, when families traditionally get together, she was inundated with offers of people who wanted to visit her. 

It means that her home has been decorated for New Year for the first time, people have started turning up bearing gifts for a New Year's feast, and there has been music and laughter from her new-found family.

Struggling to get by: Su had a hard life on her own but now has a family after the community embraced her

Shut away: Su has been lonely since her adopted daughter left aged 19 after tracking down her original parents, a wealthy couple from the Chinese capital Beijing, and going back to them instead

Here to help: Volunteers touched by Su's plight have rushed to her village to start the New Year party

One young man, Wang Wen, 25, has put up a tent in her loft and promised to spend the entire New Year with her.

Another visitor, Heng Wan, 29, said: 'I lost both my parents in a car accident so when I heard about this woman I was very happy to visit her and give her what she never had. 

'She really is a wonderful and remarkable woman.'

And Fang Kung, 30, who also visited, said: 'I live near my family and I will be spending New Year with them, but I wanted to take one day to visit this woman and give her a little something as well to also honour my own family.'

Su is not somebody who complains and she gets by on a pension of just £100-a-month and some help from her neighbours, who bring her food and help her occasionally around the house.

She said: 'I managed to save up enough money for a coffin and gravestone, and I only spoke to the paper because I wondered if they might be able to help me to find somebody to mourn at my grave. 

'I wasn't expecting anyone to care or to turn up like this.' 

Here to stay: Wang Wen, 25, has put up a tent in Su's loft and will stay for the whole New Year with her

No trouble: Volunteers decorate in preparation for the festivities, for which Su now has plenty of company

Scraping by: Su is not somebody who complains and she manages to live on a pension of just £100-a-month

Tragic: Su incredibly lost all of her 17 children shortly after they were born or while they were still young

In the styx: Su lives on her own in the village, but now has company thanks to her local paper
