The father of murdered backpacker David Miller has said his son died a hero, trying to help fellow victim Hannah Witheridge.

Ian Miller said last night that his ‘wonderful boy’ was probably killed attempting to save the 23-year-old.

‘It has become clearer and clearer that it is quite likely David was stepping in to help a girl who was in trouble,’ the 57-year-old, from St Helier in Jersey, said. ‘That would be absolutely in his character.’

He spoke as it emerged Miss Witheridge may have been raped by two local men before she was killed on Koh Tao island.

But Thai police said they ‘still believe sexual jealousy is at the heart of this crime’. 

Colonel Kissana Phathanachareon cited ‘fresh evidence which could lead to a new suspect who may have had a relationship or one-night stand with Hannah or one of her friends or David’.

The Bangkok Post last night reported police had narrowed their inquiry to two suspects – a Thai national and a Burmese worker.

The bodies of students David Miller and Hannah Witheridge were found last Monday on Sairee Beach, Thailand

The bodies of the students, who were staying in the same apartment complex, were found last Monday on Sairee Beach.

Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, was bludgeoned with a hoe found nearby while Mr Miller, 24, was battered with an unknown ‘metal weapon’.

DNA from Miss Witheridge’s body came from two Asian men – but did not match any of 12 suspects.

It is claimed she may have spoken with her attackers before being dragged to her death, with Mr Miller killed after coming to her aid.

Officers said it appeared one killer had left his blue shorts at the scene, putting on Mr Miller’s ‘better quality’ beige pair. Last night James Isaacs, a tourist, claimed two British women were recently mugged by a Thai motorbike gang at the spot where the bodies were found.

Mr Miller, a businessman, said the family has not been kept informed by Thai police. He added: ‘We have had very little information here about how they are getting on there. We know they are busy but we haven’t got any inside track.’

What can the DNA tell us?

DNA found on Miss Witheridge’s body is thought to be from two Asian men. One of the men’s DNA was found on a cigarette butt.

What about CCTV?

Mr Miller and Chris Ware were filmed leaving a bar at 12.55am. Mr Ware told police they returned to Ocean View guesthouse. Mr Miller went out again at 1am to buy cigarettes, he said. Another friend said Mr Miller ended up in AC nightclub with Miss Witheridge and a friend.

What happened next?

CCTV shows Mr Miller walking towards Ocean View alone. There is no more footage of Miss Witheridge. She may have walked on the beach and met her killers. Police do not know if she saw Mr Miller or if he heard her scream.

What were the weapons?

The killers appear to have found a garden hoe and a metal bar lying near the beach. The metal bar has not yet been located by police.

What mistakes have Thai police made?

The island was not locked down quickly after the bodies were found. Crime scene was not taped off, and full statements not taken from friends. Many conflicting statements by police. Chances of finding killers shrinking rapidly.
