Next time someone criticises you for playing too much Candy Crush, you can tell them you’re actually solving a complex mathematical problem.

Australian researcher Toby Walsh wanted to test whether the game was what’s called NP-hard - or difficult to solve without a computer.

To test this theory, he constructed a theoretical board of candies and was able to turn it into a logical math puzzle - meaning the strategy could be classified alongside other complex problems, confirming it is NP.

Australian Toby Walsh wanted to test whether Candy Crush was NP-complete, or difficult to solve without a computer. To test this theory, he constructed a theoretical board of candies and turned it into a logic puzzle. The high number of possible outcomes he uncovered proves the games complexity

Put simply, if a starting board of 
candies has two instances where a row of three can be made, the player 
has to decide which row to complete first.

Once they have selected this row, it sets off a chain reaction and directly influences which candies fall where as the game continues.

Once
 the game is solved, the player would need to start again, but this time 
choose the other row option, to determine which route scored the highest 
points.

To make an 
informed, mathematical decision about which row to choose, however, 
requires knowing what candies will appear once the row has been 
completed.

Each time candies fall, they create a number of new row options, increasing the number of possible outcomes.

To
 check the best score, the player would have to go back over each 
possible outcome, and the rows that follow - producing a puzzle that 
can’t be solved manually.

Candy Crush Saga is a hugely popular game in which players move different coloured candies around a board to create lines of three in a row.

Once a line of three matching candies is completed, they disappear and candies drop from the top of the screen to fill the gaps.

Early rounds involve making a number of swaps in a set timeframe, or to achieve a minimum score.

Due to the large number of variables, Toby Walsh from NICTA and University of New South Wales, wanted to see whether the game was a P math problem, or an NP problem.

P problems are puzzles that are easy to solve, while NP problems are much more difficult and can only be solved by a computer because of the large amount of data produced.

To test this theory, Walsh constructed a theoretical board of candies, in which the size of the board was unrestricted.

He then tested whether it was possible to create a sequence of swaps (k) that obtained a specific score (s). 

If a board of candies has two instances where a row of three can be made, the player has to decide which row to complete first. This sets off a chain reaction and directly influences future moves. Once the game is solved, the player must start again numerous times to try all the possible swap options

This turned the game into a mathematical problem. In the process of trying to solve this formula, Walsh concluded the variables and possible outcomes for each level were so high only a computer would be able to process the information – making the puzzle not only NP, but NP-complete.

NP-complete puzzles have solutions that can be applied to all other NP problems, but finding that one solution is difficult.

For example, if Walsh found the solution to the Candy Crush problem, in theory, this same solution could be applied to other puzzles with large number of variables and outcomes.

The same strategy was also used to prove games including Super Mario Brothers and Zelda are also NP-hard.

'Part of its addictiveness may be that Candy Crush is a computationally hard puzzle to solve,' concluded Walsh.

NP is a problem that is difficult to check, or can only be solved with a PC

They then tried to establish a generic formula for solving each puzzle

This involved trying to prove whether a certain score could be achieved with a set number of swaps

It wasn’t easy to solve, meaning the game was classified as NP-complete
