Get set to press record. Two of our favourite TV shows could be battling it out on Christmas Day.

At 8pm, Call the Midwife fans will settle down to watch a 75-minute festive special on BBC1.

Downton Abbey viewers will be switching on to ITV at 9pm.

And if you want to watch both? There will be a 15-minute clash in which you won’t know which way to turn – unless you have a recorder.

Both dramas have pulled in some of the highest ratings of the year.

EastEnders and Coronation Street, which usually broadcast specials on Christmas Day, have suffered dwindling audiences in the past 12 months.

Instead, viewers have fallen for the charm of Call the Midwife, which features Vanessa Redgrave, Miranda Hart, and Jenny Agutter, and was a surprise success for the BBC when the first series aired in January.

Downton Abbey, which has just completed its third series, remains a firm favourite with fans both here and in the US.

Call the Midwife is based on the late 
Jennifer Worth’s memoirs about midwifery in London’s East End in the 
1950s, and pulled in more than 8.5million viewers a week.

In the festive special, viewers will see a heart-wrenching story tackling teen pregnancy, the horrors of the workhouse, and child mortality.

In contrast, Downton Abbey will be in summer holiday mode for its Christmas special.

Lord and Lady Grantham will be enjoying a summer break with their Scottish cousins at Duneagle Castle, accompanied by servants Bates, Anna, and O’Brien.

This is the home of Lady Rose, played by newcomer Lily James, who was sent home in the last episode of series three after her dalliance with a married man.

There is a suggestion of new romance for Lady Edith and even cook Mrs Patmore, and more  arguments for Matthew and Mary.

A BBC insider said the final touches were still being made to the Christmas schedule, adding: ‘We are still finalising schedules and will avoid any overlap if we can.’

Other festive season highlights on the BBC include a Doctor Who special and an episode of the comedy Miranda.

That means viewers will have a double helping of Miss Hart at Christmas.
