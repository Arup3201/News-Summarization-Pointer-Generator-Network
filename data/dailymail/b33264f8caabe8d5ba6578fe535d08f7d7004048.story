Thrill-seekers will rate it as one of the best observation decks in the world while the less adventurous might say it is a bridge too far. 

If you suffer from even the slightest vertigo then this new 'Skywalk' observation deck in Yunyang County, southwest China, is probably best kept off any list of potential holiday destinations.

The cantilevered platform in Chongqing will give visitors a 720 degree view of the canyon below - all while standing at a vantage point 1123 meters above sea level, reports the People's Daily.

Overhang: The cantilevered platform in Chongqing measures 27 metres from the edge of the cliff and 718 metres above the river in the basin below

The spectacular viewing area protrudes nearly 27 metres from the cliff face at the Longgang scenic area - which is five metres longer than a similar tourist attraction at the Grand Canyon in America. 

Work on the £3.7 million structure started in March last year and workmen can still be seen putting the finishing touches on the terrifying stage.  

Under construction: Workman stand on the incredible new viewing platform in Yunyang County, China. The observation deck on a 718-metre cliff will be open to anyone who dares in May

Daredevils will no-doubt flock to the transparent structure to get a dizzying peak at the valley floor, a staggering 718 metres below them. 

It will open to anyone who is brave enough to venture out in May.

Rival: The cantilevered platform in Chongqing, China, is five metres longer than the skywalk at the Grand Canyon, pictured
