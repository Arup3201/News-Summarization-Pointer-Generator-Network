Elizabeth Cowhig, 22, has won nearly £13,000 in damages after being sexually harassed at Digital Maintenance Ltd by sales manager Owen Kennard

A young woman had her bottom slapped in the office by her boss, who told her: ‘Sorry I couldn’t resist,’ an employment tribunal heard.

Married Owen Kennard, 41, told 22-year-old Elizabeth Cowhig she had ‘the best legs’ of all his staff and repeatedly made inappropriate remarks about her being ‘fit’ and ‘sexy’.

He pestered her over the course of five months, but after it became clear that she was never going to give in to his advances he sacked her without any warning.

Yesterday Miss Cowhig, from Aughton in Lancashire, spoke of her relief after being awarded £13,000 in compensation for sexual harassment.

She said: ‘I was treated in a disgusting and despicable manner. I felt embarrassed and humiliated by Mr Kennard’s behaviour and comments but was afraid of losing my job if I complained.

‘I kept telling him I wasn’t interested – he was old enough to be my father – but he refused to take no for an answer.’

She added: ‘It was never about the money, but about making sure that he couldn’t get away with treating other women the same way. Now I’m just relieved it is all over.’

Miss Cowhig’s ordeal began in August 2011 only a few weeks after she started working in a call centre for Digital Maintenance Ltd – an electronic sales firm in Liverpool.

After a few weeks Mr Kennard started ‘lingering’ at her desk, rubbing her shoulders and even kissed her forehead.

On one occasion he asked her to spend the night with him in the luxury Malmaison hotel.

He also told her: ‘You’ve got the best legs in DML.’

In December 2011 he slapped her on the bottom, saying: ‘Sorry, I couldn’t resist that.’

Owen Kennard , 41, told Miss Cowhig she had 'the best legs' of all his staff and repeatedly made inappropriate remarks, a court heard

Miss Cowhig, who said the case had left her depressed and anxious said: ‘I was shocked and angry. He did it in full view of my colleagues, which was humiliating.

‘It was totally inappropriate and left me feeling violated.'

The sales assistant also claimed she attempted to phone the firm’s managing director to complain, but was reprimanded by Mr Kennard for trying to make the call.

'Violated': Elizabeth Cowhig's legal advisor said they hoped the case would inspire other women who suffer sexual harassment to come forward

In January 2012, Mr Kennard called her into his office and sacked her without giving her any warning.

During the tribunal the father of two denied all the allegations, claiming her poor performance was behind his decision to let her go.

But an employment panel rejected his claims and found in Miss Cowhig’s favour.

In
a written judgement, they concluded: ‘Mr Kennard took the decision to 
dismiss the claimant because she had refused to accede to his sexual 
attention.

‘The suggestions that were made by Mr Kennard were sufficiently serious to constitute sexual harassment.’

Miss
Cowhig’s legal advisor Michael McDonough said: ‘We are very pleased to 
have been able to obtain some justice for Elizabeth’s appalling and 
distressing treatment.

‘We 
hope that this case is going to provide some inspiration to other women 
who are suffering sexual harassment to take action and not to tolerate 
this behaviour.’
