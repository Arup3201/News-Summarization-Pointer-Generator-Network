A man with learning difficulties and his disabled mother have died after he jumped into her lap at a train station, inadvertently hitting the control toggle of her motorised wheelchair which drove on to tracks.

Bertha Nellie Kelly, 66, died at the scene after her wheelchair became stuck between carriages at Gresham City Hall station, Portland, while her son John Paul Kelly, 48, passed away later in hospital.

Staff at the TriMet rail service say the chair became trapped as the train was pulling away from the platform on Saturday, and that the driver may have been unaware of the accident until reaching the next station.

The wheelchair became stuck between two carriages as the train moved away, and transport workers say the driver may not have been aware of the accident until stopping at the next station

John Kelly lived in an adult care home but often spent the day with his mother, when the pair would visit a farmer's market, according to The Oregonian.

At 11.25am the pair were heading to a branch of Kmart when he became excited and jumped into her lap, hitting the control toggle and moving the wheelchair forwards.

Terra Schaller, who lived two doors down from Bertha Kelly, told the paper: 'He liked to jump in her lap when he was happy. That's just what John Paul did. He liked going for a ride on her wheelchair.'

Schaller added that John Kelly had been born with the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, depriving him of oxygen and leaving him with severe learning difficulties.

Ms Kelly's best friend and next door neighbour, Sue, was at the train station  when the accident happened and tried to stop the wheelchair, but was unable to grab it.

The chair rolled off the platform and fell three foot on to the tracks where it became jammed between coupled train carriages. 

Neighbours of Ms Kelly said her son, who had severe learning difficulties, liked to jump into her lap and driver her wheelchair when he was excited. Friends have today laid tributes at her doorstep (pictured)

Police were called to the scene at 11.35 am but were unable to save Ms Kelly, a retired nurse, or her son. Officers from Gresham police are now investigating. 

Transport workers said they are not sure how the driver became aware of the trapped wheelchair, but may not have realised until pulling into the next station, nearly a mile away.

'Our thoughts and condolences go out to the family and loved ones of those affected and to our operator,' TriMet said in a statement.

At Ms Kelly's house in Portland today, neighbours and friends had laid stuffed animals and flowers in tribute to 'a sweet, sweet lady'.

She is survived by another son, two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
