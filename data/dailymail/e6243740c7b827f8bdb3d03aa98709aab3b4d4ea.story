Controversial Hollywood director Oliver Stone has announced his involvement with the new Martin Luther King biopic has abruptly ended, claiming producers 'won't go with' the story he wrote about the civil rights activist.

The three-time Oscar-winning filmmaker - whose has built a reputation for transforming politically-minded issues and stories into big screen hits, as seen in films Platoon and JFK - said he is saddened by the creative differences that brought about the end of his work on MLK, for which Jamie Foxx was attached to star as the title character.

While producers Dreamworks and Warner Bros. are yet to comment on the new development, film pundits are reporting they feared the movie would seem like a 'smear campaign' against King.

Stone - who wanted to deliver a more humanized story about King, dealing with his alleged infidelities and flaws - took to Twitter Friday to confirm the news.

Saddened: Hollywood director Oliver Stone has had his involvement with an upcoming Martin Luther King biopic ended amid reports his version of the story would appear like a 'smear campaign' against the slain civil rights activist

Oliver Stone said he wanted to deliver a look at Martin Luther King that was less saint-like and more humanized, dealing with his flaws and infidelity

‘Sad news. My MLK project involvement has ended. I did an extensive rewrite of the script, but the producers won’t go with it,’ he wrote.

‘The script dealt w/ issues of adultery, conflicts within the movement, and King’s spiritual transformation into a higher, more radical being’

‘I’m told the estate & the ‘respectable’ black community that guard King’s reputation won’t approve it. They suffocate the man & the truth.’

‘I wish you could see the film I would’ve made. I fear if ‘they’ ever make it, it’ll be just another commemoration of the March on Washington’

‘Martin, I grieve for you. You are still a great inspiration for your fellow Americans—but, thank God, not a saint.’

Stone and Foxx were announced as attached to the project three months ago, Variety reported.

Film blog FIMO is reporting the screenplay Stone produced was too contentious.

'You want to present MLK in an honorable and truthful light,' the site reported.

'You want to emphasize the good the man did for the world.

'You don’t want to create a smear campaign.'

Political biopics have enjoyed a resurgence following the popularity of 2013 Oscar favorite Lincoln, starring Daniel Day Lewis.

The MLK project is likely to continue without Stone, as the left-wing director suggested in his Tweets.

The story was expected to follow the slain Civil Rights hero from his rise all the way to his assassination in 1968.

While Stone seemed an obvious choice to man the movie, he is notorious for igniting controversy and debate through his work by challenging ideas.

His JFK film, which was released in 1991 and starred Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones, created a new wave of conspiracy theories surrounding the president's assassination in 1964.

In the film, Stone suggests that there were a number of witnesses along the Dallas parade route who thought that they saw someone on the ground - and not Lee Harvey Oswald, who was on the sixth floor of the Texas Book Depository- who fired shots from a inconspicuous spot near a fence.

Stone has continually debunked the government-backed 'single bullet theory' used to explain Kennedy's death.

It's said that one bullet hit Kennedy in the back and exited his body through his throat, before hitting Governor John Connally in the front seat and breaking two different bones in Connally's body.

'Now, I've been in the infantry and I've seen enough combat to tell you that in all the craziness of war, this Alice in Wonderland scenario defies physics and common sense,' Stone, who served in the Vietnam War, wrote in an editorial for USA Today in November.

'The American people are not stupid.'

More recently Stone hit headlines with The Untold History of the United States, a 10-part Showtime series.

Starting with World War I and ending with the first Obama administration, the series was lauded by some but slammed by others as 'mendacious' and 'misleading'.

Stone has won three Oscars.

The films he has directed have been nominated for 31 Academy Awards, including eight for acting, six for screen writing and three for directing.
