A mother has spoken of her disgust after staff at a medical centre refused to treat her unconscious five year-old son because he wasn’t registered at the practice.

Natalie Midgley, 27, desperately tried to revive her son Junior after he collapsed just a few yards from the centre.

But when a family friend ran in for help she was told to phone 999 because the youngster wasn’t registered there and wasn’t known to them.

Ms Midgley was with her son when she dropped the friend off for a medical appointment at Petersgate Medical Centre, near Scawthorpe, Doncaster.

Her son, who had been suffering from undiagnosed seizures for nearly six months, then suddenly collapsed.

Emergency services were alerted and Junior recovered consciousness just as an ambulance arrived to take him to Doncaster Royal Infirmary.

Ms Midgley said: 'It was the worst experience of my life. Junior had been at A&E just a few hours earlier in the morning because he’d been going pale and having seizures for the past few months.

'He is still undergoing tests to find 
out what is causing the seizures. On the way to drop off my friend he 
started going really grey and I knew what was going to happen.

'He kept lapsing in and out of 
consciousness and he wasn’t responding to my voice. My friend ran into 
the medical centre for help. I thought I was in the best place possible 
because I needed help quickly.

But
 when they discovered he wasn’t registered with them they refused to 
help us. I was absolutely disgusted, I couldn’t believe they would 
refuse to help a five year-old child who was lying in my arms 
unconscious.

Last week a two-year-old bleeding heavily from a severe head wound was refused emergency first aid at an NHS urgent care centre – even though he suffered the injury in the waiting room.

Apo Bakan tripped and banged his head on a chair, leaving a gash on his forehead that exposed his skull. His mother Linzi pleaded for help but a nurse and a GP told her to go to the nearest A&E unit instead because they didn’t deal with ‘things like this’.

Mrs Bakan, 27, said: ‘Apo was covered in blood. When I saw his skull I was hysterical. I begged staff to help but they wouldn’t. There was no comfort, no care and no compassion.’

Mrs Bakan had taken Apo to the Doctor Piper House Urgent Care Centre in Darlington with her husband, also called Apo, in May 2012 to ask about a skin complaint. 

The boy’s wound was later stitched up at The University Hospital of North Durham.

'My worst fears were that he might die. It was very scary and no one even came out out to look at Junior or help us.

'The ambulance people tried to talk us through what to do while they were on their way. It took about 10 minutes for them to arrive and they were the longest 10 minutes of my life.'

Ms Midgley's friend Storm Styles, 38, said: 'I told the receptionist that Junior and his mum were not registered with the practice but she said there was nothing they could do and suggested I phone 999. No one even came out to check his condition. It was disgusting.'

Junior was checked at hospital and is due to have a follow up appointment in an effort to discover the problem. Doctors have suggested he could be suffering from a form of epilepsy.

Ms Midgley, who has two other children Coben, nine, and three-year-old Jenson, is now making an official complaint to the medical centre which employs five doctors, four nurses, five reception and administration staff and a community midwife.

A spokesman for Petersgate Medical Centre said; 'We are sorry to hear about this incident and hope that the child has made a full recovery.

'We are unable to comment further at this point of time, but will ensure that if a complaint is made it will be fully investigated.'
