Liverpool will lay down the law to Mario Balotelli over what they expect from him as he closes in on a £16million move to Anfield.

Brendan Rodgers’ summer-long search for a top-class striker has led him to Balotelli, the Italy forward who he said two weeks ago would ‘categorically not be at Liverpool’.

However, an about-turn by Rodgers has seen Liverpool agree a deal with AC Milan to sign Balotelli. They initially enquired about taking him for a season but were quoted an exorbitant loan fee.

Liverpool believe the 24-year-old is value for money at £16m, given some of the prices quoted for other strikers who have moved during this window, and have offered him a deal worth £90,000 a week.

Nevertheless, Liverpool officials met Balotelli’s representatives in a city centre hotel on Thursday night and made it clear that they would expect absolute commitment from the former Manchester City Milan forward, on and off the field.

Balotelli’s career has been littered with bizarre episodes, such as setting off fireworks in his bathroom, and they want guarantees from him there will be no more erratic behaviour. If Balotelli is not willing to accept, Liverpool would walk away and look at other targets, headed by Samuel Eto’o.

This move, though, comes after Liverpool have done significant research into his character and Rodgers believes Balotelli has the tools to help his side develop in the Barclays Premier League and the Champions League. More significantly, it is felt he will thrive in the environment at Liverpool’s Melwood training base, where Rodgers has built a tightly knit group that is strong enough to cope with the arrival of such a larger-than-life figure.

Some will wonder why, after selling Luis Suarez, Liverpool are prepared to take another gamble but Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher feels Rodgers’ man-management would help Balotelli.

‘The main thing for any player is what he does on the pitch,’ said Carragher. ‘Both players had issues off the pitch, but I think it’s fair to say Suarez did a lot more on the pitch. Would Balotelli be the final piece of the jigsaw? Would he make the starting XI if everyone was fit and firing? Who knows?’

Although Balotelli was a controversial figure off the field at City, he was a relative success on it during his three years at the club between 2010 and 2013. After his £24m move from Inter Milan he helped City win their first Premier League title, won the FA Cup and Community Shield and scored 30 goals in 50 starts.

Having invested £101m to give their squad depth during this window, Liverpool have been the Premier League’s biggest spenders but the one problem area for Rodgers was finding a top-class front man to work alongside — and provide competition for — Daniel Sturridge.

They initially had a deal in place for Loic Remy of Queens Park Rangers but called it off at the 11th hour because of a discrepancy with his medical. Liverpool then turned to Monaco’s Radamel Falcao, whom they would have paid £12million to take for a season. Falcao never gave any encouragement, which then led them to Eto’o and finally Balotelli. Should talks continue to run as smoothly as they have done, there is potential for the deal to be completed at some point during the weekend.

The move would leave Milan in the market for a new striker and may cause a domino effect that could see Tottenham misfit Roberto Soldado head for the San Siro, to be replaced at White Hart Lane by Remy.

Soldado has not been a success since his £26m move from Valencia last summer, Thursday night’s goal against Limassol notwithstanding. He is set to continue under new manager Mauricio Pochettino as understudy to Emmanuel Adebayor in a system with only one central striker. Spurs are keen to move for unsettled France striker Remy, but they have such a large squad that they do not want to bloat it further without moving players out.

Vlad Chiriches is another who is available and Roma are interested if they sell centre-half Mehdi Benatia, who is closing in on a move to Bayern Munich after rejecting Manchester United.

Roma officials have been in England this week. They like Chiriches and have a familiar route of negotiation through Tottenham’s technical director Franco Baldini, but are also looking at Manchester City’s Matija Nastasic.

Pochettino has been chasing Villarreal defender Mateo Musacchio but have hit a snag unravelling the Argentine’s complicated ownership history, and are also considering Sevilla’s Federico Fazio, another Argentine.
