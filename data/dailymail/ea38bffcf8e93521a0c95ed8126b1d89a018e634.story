Engineers from Sichuan University have designed an LED projector that can be fitted to bicycles and help cyclists see the road ahead more effectively at night.

Lumigrids projects square grids onto the ground in front of the bike.

As the road surface changes, the grid bends, curves and changes shape to highlight the potential hazards ahead.

Lumigrids, an LED projector that can be fitted to bicycles to help cyclists see at night, has been designed by a team of engineers from Sichuan University. Lumigrids projects square grids onto the ground in front of the bike, as the road surface changes, the grid bends, curves and changes shape to highlight the hazards ahead

The Lumigrids projector is fixed to a bicycle’s handlebars.

It can be powered by either an internal battery, when the bike is waiting at traffic lights or stationary.

When the bicycle is moving, the rotation of the wheels can also power the gadget.

Lumigrids only uses one button so that the rider isn't distracted when trying to use it while cycling.

The
 first press turns it on, the second press changes the mode of 
projection, and holding the button down for two seconds turns the gadget
 off.

Lumigrids has three modes with different grid sizes that can be used to adapt to different situations.

These are normal mode (14x18cm), high-speed mode (14x26cm), and team mode (30x20cm).

Lumigrids has now been awarded the Red Dot Design Award for 2012 in the 'best of the best' category.

The Chinese designers came up with the idea because they thought traditional bicycle lamps hindered the rider's judgment.

In the award entry, they said: 'It can be difficult for night cyclists to get a good sense of the condition of the terrain ahead, even with a typical bicycle lamp.

'In many cases, a bicycle lamp will cast shadows on both concave and convex areas of the ground.

'This can hinder the rider's judgment of the road surface ahead, and increase the potential for danger.'

On a flat road surface, the Lumigrids is made of standard squares. On a rough road surface, the grid's squares deform to correspond with the shape of the hazard in the road, or hole. Cyclists can monitor the motion and deformation of the grids and read the road ahead

Cyclists can monitor the motion and deformation of the grids to read the road ahead.

The grids can also make the bicycle more visible, making it easier for pedestrians and vehicles to notice the bicycle and reduce the chances of collisions and road accidents.

They have not released details of when the Lumigrids will be available to buy, or how much it will cost.
