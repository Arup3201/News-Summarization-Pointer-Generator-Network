Alan Pardew has revealed that the man who potentially saved his job – Papiss Cisse – should NOT have played against Hull City.

The Senegal striker came from the bench to score twice in 13 minutes and rescue a point – and perhaps more – for Pardew.

But the advice of United’s medical staff was not to include Cisse, who hasn’t featured since last season after breaking his kneecap in April.

The pressure was mounting on Pardew until Cisse saved the day by scoring two late goals 

Pardew, though, gambled by naming the 29-year-old on the bench and he scored twice to save a 2-2 draw.

And the boss – whose position is now safe in the short term - said: ‘Cisse should not have played. My medical staff did not agree that he should be included. He’s trained five days.

‘But myself and John looked at him on Thursday and thought “he’s fresh, he’s bright, he’s not ready for 90 minutes but he knows how to carry the jersey”.

‘That’s where I felt some sympathy for Manu. He’s not ready to carry that jersey yet full-time, it’s heavy that No 9. He’s had too much responsibility.

‘That was great to see Papiss take that chance, that little movement and pessimism in the box.’
