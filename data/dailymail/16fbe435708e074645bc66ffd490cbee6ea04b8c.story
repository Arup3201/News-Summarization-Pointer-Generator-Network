A Good Samaritan haunted by the face of a dying man who had been savagely beaten committed suicide less than 12 hours after trying to save him

Sean Lyons, 24, was so traumatised about witnessing the killing, he hanged himself after telling friends and family: 'I can’t get that man's face out of my head.'

His body was later discovered under a footbridge by a dog walker moments after he was spotted by another passerby leaning against the rails with 'glazed eyes.'

He had called police just 30 minutes before his death to tell what he witnessed and to say he would attend a police station to give a full statement.

The tragedy began at 7pm on May 30 when the labourer - described by friends as a 'star who lived life to the full' - was being driven through Levenshulme, Manchester, following a training session at a local boxing gym.

Michael Dolan told an inquest how he called an ambulance as Mr Lyons tried to revive the victim

He saw 40-year-old Glen Delaney being beaten up in the street and told his friend Michael Dolan to stop the car and call an ambulance, before he tried to revive the victim as the killers fled.

Despite the efforts of the two men Mr Delaney died that night in hospital from severe facial injuries.

Mr Dolan, 24, told the hearing in Sale: 'We saw a man in the street and he was being badly beaten.

'His face was a mess and we rang an ambulance. It came and we were told later the man had died.

'At the scene Sean had been sick at the side of the van. But it was more him looking after me that night.

'We went back to my girlfriend’s and he seemed OK at this point.

'We stayed up late but I had work in the morning. He seemed fine when I'd left him and we had made plans for the next day.

'Sean had seen a group of men across the road so was going to speak to the police.

'Next thing we were aware of is when we got a phone call from Sean's mum saying he hadn't come home.

'There was no indication he had something on his mind.'

Sean’s mother, Bridget Lyons, from 
Reddish, near Stockport, said: 'At about 7pm on Thursday, May 30 he rang
his dad on his mobile.

'On his way back from boxing with Michael he said he had seen someone collapsed in the street and people were running away.

'He was very subdued on the phone. He wasn’t talking much only about the guy who died after being beaten up.

'He put Michael on the phone and he was very talkative.

'They were telling us what they saw. They tried to resuscitate him.

'We could tell he was affected by what he had seen, he was very sensitive. He had never seen anything like what he described that night.

'They had gone out after coming across that incident. Sean had gone back to Michael’s girlfriend’s and I told him to come home.

'He seemed fine. He was concerned for Michael after what they had seen and in my opinion Sean felt he was needed.

'I would have expected him to be home by 1.20am. I said he needed to come home and he said he would be home soon.

'He said "I can't get that man’s face out of my head".

'He had texted his dad next day about 
going into police station. We then fell asleep and realised he hadn’t 
came home when we woke up.'

The hearing was told how after leaving the home of Michael’s girlfriend, Sean came across a group of four young women camping in a field in Stockport.

Ailish Hession told the inquest: 'He told us about the man earlier and he didn’t want to go home to sleep because he couldn’t get his face out of his head.

'He went to speak to someone on the phone at about 5.20.

'You wouldn’t know anything was wrong with him. He seemed happy. He said he wasn’t tired and he was going to go.

'He said he was going to go to a friend’s house and was going to come back if we were still awake.'

In the minutes before his death Sean took some pictures of himself smiling at 6.15am on his mobile whilst stood on the footbridge.

He also had sent his father, Andy, a text saying: 'Sorry I haven’t come home. Was with Michael and didn’t want to wake you up.'

Police said Sean also made a six minute 999 call at 5.40am to an operator to report he had witnessed the murder

Inspector Laura Escott said: 'I listened to his call and had a transcript prepared.

'There was nothing in the call that would give cause for concern. His first words to the call taker were "Hiya love".

'He said he was prepared to be a witness and would come into the police station later that day. He gave his name, date of birth and address.

'I made a conscious decision not to speak to the call handler who took the call.

'I didn't believe she was at fault. I listened to the call myself.

'I thought I might distress her by telling her a person who spoke to her had taken their own life a short time later.'

Recording a suicide verdict Coroner Joanne Kearsley said: 'It’s difficult to know what to say where there is clearly so little indication that something so tragic was going to occur.

'He told police about what was such a distressing incident. He had met a group of people and there’s nothing unusual about that.

'But he leaves there at 5.30am and texts a number of family and friends and there’s nothing to give any indication.

'To all Sean’s family can I just offer my condolences. He was a young man with so much to live for.'

A man is awaiting trial over Delaney's murder.
