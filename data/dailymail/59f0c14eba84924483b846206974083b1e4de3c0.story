The couple held hostage by Somali pirates for more than a year are planning to finish their round-the-world sailing trip.

Rachel and Paul Chandler said they had the support of family and friends who raised half a million pounds of ransom money for them.

They were kidnapped in the Indian Ocean in October 2009 and held separately for more than a year. Mr Chandler said those around them had been 'wonderful'.

'They want us to get our lives back, and life for us at the moment is travelling and sailing,' he told BBC Radio Five Live.

'I think they are relaxed about it, I 
don't think they would be very positive if we were to be captured again,
but we had bad luck, we were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and 
the chances of it happening again are incredibly small.'

Mrs Chandler said: 'From day one, our 
close family and friends were very keen that we should get back to 
normal, they were very worried that would be permanently scarred by what
had happened to us.

'I think it was reassuring to them 
that, having found out that we had our boat back, that the Navy had 
brought our boat back for us, for them to know that we did actually want
to restore it, and get back to cruising to get our lives back again, 
was reassuring to them.'

Terrifying: The couple were held hostage by gun-toting pirates who stormed their yacht, Lynn Rival, near the Seychelles

When they have spoken previously about their plans to finish their round-the-world journey, they said they would steer clear of the head to the Caribbean.

The couple spent 388 days in captivity
after armed raiders boarded their 38ft yacht, Lynn Rival, as they 
sailed from the Seychelles to Tanzania in notoriously dangerous waters.

The retired pair, from Tunbridge Wells in Kent, were released in November 2010 after a ransom was paid.

They have been busy repairing Lynn Rival, the yacht they were sailing 
when they were kidnapped, and are preparing for an Atlantic voyage.

Last year, Mr Chandler has posted 
pictures online repairing the decking on the vessel and fitting new teak
strips - the wooden cladding which appears on top.

Retired civil engineer Mr Chandler 
and his wife, now aged 60 and 57 respectively, had left their Kent home 
and were near the Seychelles when they were kidnapped from their 38ft 
yacht on October 23, 2009.

Describing
their story later to the Daily Mail, they recalled their terror as the 
gun-toting pirates stormed their yacht, their anger that a nearby Royal 
Navy ship failed to intervene and their brutal treatment at the hands of
their captors.

They revealed how their family paid 
£280,000, only for the pirates to refuse to let them go, and how they 
were told they were going to be killed days before they were finally 
freed.

They were released on November 14, 2010 – after 388 days – when a ransom of £625,000 was paid.

They were reunited with the Lynn Rival at a boat yard at Buckler’s Hard, near Lymington, Hampshire.

In a book recounting their ordeal, Mrs Chandler wrote: ‘This is where the insurers have brought her for restoration.

‘Paul checks her out with his 
engineer’s eye. As I go down the steps and glance around, there’s a 
tiny, chilling sense they haven’t quite gone: Scrabble tiles on the 
floor, grease and rice spilled all over the galley.

‘I know I’m not fit enough yet but I 
can’t wait to start clearing up! It will take a lot of work to exorcise 
the ghosts, but I’m happy that she will be ours again.'
