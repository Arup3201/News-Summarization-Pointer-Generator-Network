More than 400 injured servicemen and women will line up to take part in the Invictus Games this week.

For each of them, competing in the Games is the latest turn in a long road to recovery from devastating injuries sustained in war.

Among them will be British Royal Marine Reservist Lance Corporal John James Chalmers, whose arms were blown to pieces in an IED attack in Afghanistan in 2011.

Lance Corporal John James Chalmers had his arm grafted to his stomach as part of his long treatment after he was caught up in an IED explosion in Afghanistan in 2011. He is now set to compete in the Invictus Games

Lance Corporal Chalmers was serving as a Royal Marine reservist with 42 Commando in Helmand province when he was injured in the blast, which killed two of his comrades

He was flown home after the attack - which killed two of his comrades - and, after waking up in a British hospital, has since undergone nearly 30 operations.

The 26-year-old, from Edinburgh, is still having treatment and will only be able to compete thanks to an operation which saw his arm sewn to his stomach for six weeks.

Lance Corporal Chalmers lost two fingers, had his right elbow destroyed and suffered facial and leg injuries in the blast in May 2011.

Describing the moments after the explosion, he told the Daily Mirror: 'I went to move one of my arms after I was hit and it just wasn't there – it was hanging off.

'Then I brought my other hand up and I saw all of my fingers either gone or hanging off and I just thought; 'What can I do for myself now?''

After an agonizing wait for help to arrive, Lance Corporal Chalmers - known to friends as 'JJ'- was rescued and flown home, waking up 10 days later in hospital in Birmingham surrounded by his family.

Despite initially hoping he might be able to return to the front to fight, the intervening years have been a hard battle through a series of operations, some up to 14 hours long.

As well as having tissue transplanted from his leg to his arm, he also had his arm grafted to his midriff, in what he describes as a 'sling created out of my own skin'.

Three years after the blast which nearly killed him, Lance Corporal Chalmers is now preparing to compete in the cycling, volleyball and athletics in the Games, which start in London tonight.

The Games will kick off a year of celebration for the commando, who is planning to marry fiancée Kornelia Chitrusko, 27, in the New Year.

He said: 'The Invictus Games have given a whole international community of wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women something to strive for.

'For us it's about much more than four days of sport. We'll be ready to show our Invictus spirit in the sporting arena.

'That all starts with the opening ceremony and we hope the public will be there to give us their support. It promises to be quite a show and will set the tone for what's to come.' 

The opening ceremony will feature a flypast from the Red Arrows over the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London this evening.

The 5,000-strong audience will include Prince Harry, his brother the Duke of Cambridge, their father the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.

After gathering on the south lawn of the park, they will watch a competitors' parade, as well as displays by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery and the Queen's Colour Squadron, and bands from the Royal Marines, Army and RAF.

The Duchess of Cambridge, who is expecting her second child and is suffering from acute morning sickness, will not be able to attend.

The Invictus Games have been championed by Harry and backed by William and Kate as well as the Ministry of Defence.

Over four days, both serving military personnel and veterans from 13 nations will go head to head in nine adaptive sports in London.

Teams have travelled from the USA, Denmark, Estonia, France and Italy, Canada, Holland, Australia, Afghanistan, Georgia, New Zealand and Germany for the games, which were inspired by the United States' Warrior Games.

Harry confessed to a few 'sleepless nights' in the run-up to the games, but said he had been humbled by the experience.

He said: 'I think everyone should be humbled. The reaction I have seen today for all the organising committee has reminded us exactly why we have done this. The difference it's going to make for these guys to be part of these games is huge.

For British Armed Forces team captain Dave Henson (pictured, right), the Invictus Games is a showcase for what injured servicemen and women can do.

The 29-year-old, who lost his legs when he was blown up by an IED in Helmand Province in 2011, is competing in the sitting volleyball at the Games, as well as the 100m and 200m.

He said: 'I want people to think "Yes, that was a fantastic competition", but also, "These servicemen and women are something else, what can we do to make sure that this display and show of strength of character is a regular occurrence?".

'I want people to be thinking "What else can these guys do if we start giving them jobs or other focus - what else can they achieve?".

'Most of all, I want people to see that we're here, and recognise these military guys and girls.'

Mr Henson, from the Royal Engineers, said it was a 'huge honour' to have been selected to captain Britain's team, which he insists is looking good and is 'raring to go'.

He said his own training has gone well, adding: 'I'm slightly ahead of where I thought I was going to be for the 200m, which is good.

'I feel strong, I just hope I don't fall over. It's always a risk when you're running on two blades.'

Mr Henson, from Southampton, told how sport had helped him in his own journey to recovery, along with many of his team-mates.

He said: 'It's something I found since these Games were announced in March, you see people on their different journeys.

'You can see a change in someone from a year ago, it really can play such a positive role in someone's recovery, it's fantastic to see.'

The military-themed opening ceremony is set to take place outside London's Olympic stadium later today

Ahead of the opening ceremony, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'This is a momentous day for the British team who demonstrate the remarkable spirit and determination that defines our Armed Forces.

'They are testament to the excellent care and support that is available through our world-renowned Defence Rehabilitation process.'

'Our Armed Forces have played a major role in making the Games happen - not just our inspiring competitors but also the 500 service personnel in a wide range of roles who will be supporting their comrades.'

Barack Obama has wished the teams well in a video message of support for wounded servicemen and women.

In a pre-recorded message played to teams ahead of the Games, the US President said : 'I know it's going to be a fiercely competitive few days but the truth is that everyone of you in these games, every service member and veteran, has already earned our highest admiration and our deepest gratitude.

'When your countries asked you to serve, to risk everything to protect our safety and our freedom, you and your families answered the call and just as you inspire us with your courage on the battlefield, your grit and resilience when you take the playing field, your incomparable souls inspire us today.'

Tickets for the games can be bought at www.invictusgames.org and members of the public can donate £5 to Help for Heroes by texting SPORT to 70900.
