Killer: Joseph Wood gasped for nearly two hours as he was being executed for murdering two people

Bungling Arizona executioners administered at least two full doses of a lethal injection cocktail to double-murderer Joseph Wood in a desperate attempt to finish him off, it emerged today.

Doctors and government officials watched the convicted killer let out hundreds of blood-curdling 'snorts and gasps' for 117 minutes as the deadly drugs coursed through his veins on Wednesday.

But when the first batch did not achieve the desired effect, they decided to pump a second dose into his body, Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Zick told Reuters.

Even so, state corrections officials pushed back against any suggestion the procedure was botched, saying Wood was fully sedated and never felt any pain.

Wood - who gunned down his former 
girlfriend and her father in 1989 - was put to death at the state prison
 in Florence after losing a last-minute appeal.

Witnesses described seeing Wood struggling to breathe and gasping for air almost the entire time.

But, during an emergency hearing conducted mid-execution at the request of defense lawyers, Zick told a judge that the condemned man was unconscious and having an 'involuntary' reaction, according to a transcript provided by defense attorneys.

'That involuntary reaction continues, but I am told that Mr. Wood is effectively brain dead and that this is the type of reaction that one gets if they were taken off life support,' Zick said, according to the transcript. 'The brain stem is working but there's no brain activity.'

Defense lawyers, in demanding an outside review into what they say was 'the most prolonged bungled execution in recent history,' want to determine in part which drugs were used and in what amounts.

'It is important for the people of Arizona to get answers, and only an independent investigation can provide the transparency needed following an execution cloaked in secrecy that went wrong,” defense attorney Dale Baich said.

He said later he had no information about the second dose of drugs given to his client: 'It appears from what the AG said that at least a second dose was administered. We expect this information to come out during an independent investigation.'

It comes as Arizona Senator John McCain, himself tortured for years while held captive in a Vietnamese prison, branded the execution as a form of 'torture.'

Inhumane:
 Arizona Republic justice reporter Michael Kiefer describes how Wood 
gasped and breathed heavily before he died. Media witnesses agreed they 
had never seen an execution like it

'I believe in the death penalty for 
certain crimes. But that is not an acceptable way of carrying it out. 
And people who were responsible should be held responsible,' McCain told
 Politico.
 'The lethal injection needs to be an indeed lethal injection and not 
the bollocks-upped situation that just prevailed. That’s torture.'

McCain
 spent five years in the 'Hanoi Hilton' - a nickname for the Vietnamese 
prison camp where he was held captive - after his plane was shot down. 
He eventually was released, but was tortured repeatedly while a prison.

As Wood gasped for air, his lawyers filed an emergency appeal in federal court demanding that it be stopped. The appeal said Wood was 'gasping and snorting for more than an hour'

Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne's office says 
Wood was pronounced dead at 3.49pm - an hour and 57 minutes after the
 execution started.

Wood was sentenced to death for 
killing Debra Dietz and her father, Eugene Dietz, in 1989 at the 
family's automotive shop in Tucson.

A relative of Wood's victims said she did not believe the killer had suffered - especially compared to the victims.

Desperate: Arizona's highest court on Wednesday temporarily halted the execution of the condemned inmate so it could consider a last-minute appeal. Wood's death was one of a number of botched executions

'You don't know what excruciating is,' Jeanne Brown told KTLA after the execution. 'What’s excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood, seeing you sister laying there in a pool of blood. This man deserved it. And I shouldn’t really call him a man.'

Before the murders, Wood
 and Debra Dietz, 29, had a tumultuous relationship in which he periodically 
assaulted her. Dietz tried to end their relationship and got an order of
 protection against Wood.

On
 the day of the shooting, Wood went to the auto shop and waited for 
Dietz's father, who disapproved of his daughter's relationship with 
Wood, to get off the phone. Once the father, 55, hung up, Wood pulled out a 
revolver, shot him in the chest and then smiled.

Wood
 then turned his attention toward Debra Dietz, who was trying to 
telephone for help.

Wood grabbed her by the neck and put his gun to her 
chest. She pleaded with him to spare her life. An employee heard Wood 
say, 'I told you I was going to do it, I have to kill you.' He then 
called her an expletive and fired two shots in her chest. 

Torture: Senator John McCain says the nearly two hours it took to execute Joseph Wood amounts to 'torture'

Relief: Jeanne Brown, whose sister and father were killed by Wood in 1989, is pictured at a news conference after the execution as her husband Richard Brown listens. She said that Wood had deserved to die

On Wednesday, Wood looked around the 
death chamber and glanced at the doctors as they made preparations for 
his execution, locating the proper veins and inserting two lines into 
his arms.

Wood then uttered his final words, smiled at the victim's family members and made eye contact with a deacon.

Just
 after declaring that he was at peace with his death, he smiled at the 
deacon, but for a second, a subtle look of panic took over his face.

Protest: There are growing calls in the US for the death penalty to be repealed

Officials administered the lethal drugs at 1:52 p.m. Wood's eyes closed. About 10 minutes later, the gasping began.

Wood's
 jaw dropped, his chest expanded, and he let out a gasp. The gasps 
repeated every five to 12 seconds. They went on and on, hundreds of 
times. An administrator checked on him a half-dozen times.

Troy Hayden, who witnessed the execution as he covered it for KSAZ , likened Wood’s breathing to a 'fish gulping for air'.

'It was tough for everybody in that room,' he said.

Wood could be heard snoring loudly when an administrator turned on a 
microphone to inform the gallery that Wood was still sedated, despite 
the audible sounds.

As the 
episode dragged on, Wood's lawyers frantically drew up an emergency 
legal appeal, asking federal and state courts to step in and stop the 
execution.

'He has been gasping for more than an hour,' the lawyers pleaded in their filings. 'He is still alive.'  

The
 Arizona Supreme Court convened an impromptu telephone hearing with a 
defense lawyer and attorney for the state to decide what to do.

Wood
 took his last breath at 3:37 p.m. Twelve minutes later, Arizona 
Department of Corrections Director Charles L. Ryan declared Wood dead.

The state court was informed of the death while its hearing was underway.

It
 took one hour and 57 minutes for Wood's execution to be completed, and 
Wood was gasping for more than an hour and a half of that time.

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer had told 
the Department of Corrections to review the process, saying she was 
concerned by the length of time it took to carry out the injections.

Still, she said, there was nothing unlawful about the death.

She
 said: 'One thing is certain, however, inmate Wood died in a lawful 
manner and by eyewitness and medical accounts he did not suffer.

Going forward: A fence surrounds the state prison in Florence, Arizona where the execution of Joseph Rudolph Wood was scheduled to take place on Wednesday

'This
 is in stark comparison to the gruesome, vicious suffering that he 
inflicted on his two victims — and the lifetime of suffering he has 
caused their family.'

After the death, a federal judge ordered officials to preserve all physical evidence in Wood's execution for an investigation.

The lengthy
 execution quickly re-ignited the death penalty debate as critics 
denounced it as cruel and unusual punishment and said it raised grave 
questions about the two-drug combination Arizona uses for lethal 
injections.

Wood had 
waged an intense, last-minute legal battle that challenged the state 
over key information about who supplies the drugs and how they are 
administered.

The execution came after the U.S. Supreme Court denied several appeals seeking details about the state's execution methods.

There have been several controversial 
executions recently, including that of an Ohio inmate in January who 
snorted and gasped during the 26 minutes it took him to die.
