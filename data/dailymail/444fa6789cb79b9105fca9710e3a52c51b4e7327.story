Forgiveness: Daniel Brown, pictured, was knocked out and needed surgery on his skull after an unprovoked nightclub attack - but has said he forgives the man who hurt him

A man who had to have part of his skull removed and replaced after being punched has forgiven the attacker who left him fighting for his life.

Daniel Brown suffered life-threatening brain injuries when he was attacked in a bar - but has said he is prepared to forgive the man who almost killed him.

The 20-year-old was knocked unconscious when he was punched by Jamie Robinson, also 20, in the early hours of September 7.

Robinson knocked Mr Brown out at the Britannia bar in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire with a single punch, which sent his victim sprawling down a a single punch to his head caused him to fall down a staircase.

The blow caused Daniel to the floor and left him with a fractured skull, swelling, bruising, a bleed on his brain and a blood clot.

Daniel needed an operation to remove part of his skull and his family was told there was a strong possibility he could die.

Jamie Robinson, 20, from Scunthorpe, was recently sentenced to 30 months in a young offenders’ institution after admitting inflicting grievous bodily harm.

Daniel said: 'I forgive him because I believe in forgiving, but I won’t forget and he is certainly someone I will never have any time for.

'I wouldn’t wish what happened on anyone and I am a better person than that. I will never get the last six months back and I will have the scars with me forever. But I am not ashamed of the scars because it wasn’t anything of my doing.'

Mr Brown was given craniectomy surgery at Hull Royal Infirmary to remove part of his skull and relieve the pressure from his swelling brain.

Speaking of his time since the unprovoked attack, he said: 'It has been hell. I have not been able to do the things I would normally do, such as social things with friends, going on nights out or going to football matches.

'I am hoping it is all behind me now and I can get back to normal life. Daniel who works as a waiter said he had little recollection of the events leading to the incident in the Britannia.

'Scared we would lose him': After the attack Mr Brown's parents Lisa and Ian had to prepare for the possibility that he would not survive

'I remember on the night it happened, I finished work at Domino's and drove to my friend’s because we were going out in town that night.

'We had a couple of drinks and got a taxi up to town, but I don’t remember going into any clubs or anything like that.

'All I can remember since is what my family and friends who were there at the time have said.

'I woke up in Hull Royal Infirmary with no idea of what had gone on... I was in there and had no idea why. I thought I had been cheated by life really.

'I have been in the Britannia a lot and it is not a rough club. Of all the places for it to happen, that would not have been one of my top guesses.

'For someone who is not a violent person at all, it is painful, but we are all happy that justice has been done.'

Mr Brown had an operation last week to replace the section of his skull which was removed in the craniectomy.

He is due to have the staples from the procedure removed in early April, before attending an outpatient appointment in Hull in around six weeks.

When he was first able to get out of bed in hospital, Daniel struggled to walk, which he described in a court statement as a 'huge setback'.

Venue: Mr Brown was knocked out with a single blow from his attacker in the early hours of the morning at the Britannia bar in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire

'Cheated': Mr Brown has spoken of the pain of missing out on the six months he spent recovering from the attack

But speaking after the case, he said: 'The thing that has kept me going all along is getting back to how things were.

'Some people you see with brain injuries are motivated and others not so much.

'I have always said I am a firm believer that I have got to wake up every day wanting to get better and get back to my life because if you don’t want it, you are never going to get it.

'I feel lucky that I have had no major lasting injuries such as memory loss or lack of mobility.

'I feel cheated that I have lost so much of my life but grateful to be here with my family. I am most annoyed at what he put the people I care about the most through, like my family.

'From the start, I wasn’t really aware of it but it is not just one person, it is everybody.'

His father Ian Brown, 45, described the feelings the family had when they were told about his injuries and during his recovery process.

Me said: 'It is hard to put it into words how we felt. To be told to prepare for the worst and then have to come home and tell the rest of the family is something I wouldn’t wish on anyone.

'We had to sit down with our other three children and explain how poorly their brother was and how there was a very strong possibility he might not make it.

'To take them over to Hull on the Sunday to see Daniel because it might be the last time they saw him alive was heartbreaking.

'To spend the next two or three weeks visiting Hull and watching Daniel have to learn to do everything again was an awful time.

'It is hard to put into words the feeling of helplessness, but we helped where we could and we carried out a bedside vigil.

'To us, it has been six-and-a-half terribly long months, but in the bigger scheme of things, it is a remarkable recovery.'

Scott Slingsby, owner of the Britannia bar, said: 'It is the worst incident I have known in my 25 years in the licensing trade.

'Robinson has been barred for life from the Britannia and he has been put under a five-year ban by other members of the Scunthorpe Pub Watch. '
