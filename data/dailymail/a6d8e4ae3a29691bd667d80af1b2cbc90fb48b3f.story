Oregon Senate candidate Monica Wehby harassed her husband, slapped him, pulled his hair and threw objects at him as they were going through a divorce, he told police.

The accusations have emerged in a 2007 police report that was made public on Monday - less than a week after another report showed an ex-boyfriend claimed she was stalking him.

The news also comes as the Tuesday deadline approaches for voters to return their ballots in Oregon's all-mail primary.

The latest report, dated December 2007, said Wehby's ex-husband, Jim Grant, called police saying his 'soon-to-be ex-wife' was throwing items at him inside the Portland home they still shared.

Accused: The ex-husband of Monica Wehby, a Senate candidate in Oregon, called cops on her in 2007, claiming she had harassed him and was throwing items at him during an altercation at their home

The report, which was first reported by The Oregonian, says Grant told an officer he 'is tired of the ongoing harassment by his wife'. He said that they were just weeks away from finalizing their divorce.

Grant, now 49, told police that over the previous year, Wehby had pulled his hair, slapped him and thrown items at him. On the night he called, he said Wehby slapped him with a pad of paper.

He also admitted to the officer that he'd 'been violent with her' over about three years. The report does not elaborate, and Grant could not be reached for a comment by MailOnline.

Wehby, who said she had a couple of drinks at a party earlier that night, denied hitting Grant with a pad of paper and said Grant had began swearing and yelling at her while she was on the phone.

Family: Wehby has 4 children with her ex-husband (three pictured). No charges were filed after he called cops

She confirmed that he had been physical with her in the past and had documented it with her doctors, but that she had never called police about it.

The report, which notes their four children and Wehby's mother were also home at the time, did not result in any charges. It added that the couple agreed to return to their separate rooms.

Another report from December 2009 shows that Grant also called police on her, saying she was refusing to leave the house until she saw the children.

Report: Wehby's ex, Andrew Miller, called police last year reporting that she was stalking him

It noted that they shared custody of the children, but that she often let herself into Grant's home so that she could see them.

The report says that she refused to leave the house until she could say goodbye to her children, as she was going on a trip. When Grant told her they were already in bed, she continued to bang on the door until they came downstairs.

On Friday, a separate police report had showed Wehby's former boyfriend, Andrew Miller, called police last year reporting that she was stalking him and harassing his former employees.

Miller later funded a super PAC attacking Wehby's Republican primary opponent, Jason Conger, and said he regretted calling police.

'Like a lot of women, I've gone through a divorce that was a trying time in my life for me and for my family,' Wehby, 52, said in a statement. 'I'm deeply saddened that such a personal matter, which bears no relevance to my Senate campaign, has been used as a political weapon to attack my character.'

In previous primaries, fewer than half the ballots were cast in the last two days of the election, so the impact of the latest revelations on Wehby's fortunes will be limited.

Through Sunday, 24 per cent of registered Republicans had cast a ballot.
