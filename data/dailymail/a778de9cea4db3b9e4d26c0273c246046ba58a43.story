Hoax victim: Followers of famed Lakewood Church Pastor Joel Osteen were fooled into believing he had denounced God and was quitting his church in an elaborate online prank

An internet message and news reports claiming that a famed televangelist was to renounce God and quit his church have been revealed as an elaborate online hoax.

Followers of Pastor Joel Osteen were fooled into believing that the 50-year-old preacher had lost his faith and resigned from his ministry.

But an online statement purporting to be from Mr Osteen claiming that there is 'zero evidence "God" even exists' and a series of fake news websites carrying reports of his resignation turned out to be the handiwork of pranksters.

The unknown perpetrator of the hoax set up a fake blog, an identical copy of Mr Osteen's website and a false Twitter and YouTube account to announce the Pastor's apparent resignation. 

The statement posted on the fake blog read: 'I have been accused of altering the "message" to fit my own doctrine and dogma. Others have accused me of preaching "feel good Christianity".

'I have also been accused of profiting greatly from my ministry, with my books and television deals.

'Many of their criticisms are legitimate.

'What they don't know is that deep down in my heart, for a number of years now, I have been questioning the faith, Christianity and whether Jesus Christ is really my, or anyone's, "saviour".'

It added: 'I believe now that the Bible is a fallible, flawed, highly inconsistent history book that has been altered hundreds of times.

'There is zero evidence the Bible is the holy word of God. In fact, there is zero evidence "God" even exists.'

As well as the pseudo-website, subsequent stories appeared on bogus versions of news outlets including CNN, Yahoo.com and the Christian News Network.

Prank: An announcement purporting to be from the Pastor appeared on a false version of his website

'Lost faith': The false announcement claimed that there 'is zero evidence "God" even exists'

Elaborate: A YouTube video was also created to spread the false rumour that Pastor Osteen had quit

A fake CNN banner story carried the headline: 'Pastor of mega church resigns, rejects Christ'.

But the false Twitter feed has since been removed and one of the fake websites set up, joelosteenministries.wordpress.com, suspended for violating the website's terms of service.

Officials at Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas, where Mr Osteen has been chief pastor since 1999, told The Houston Chronicle that they were aware of the hoax and 'false rumour'.

Fake: As well as the hoax statement, false versions of several top news websites were created to carry the story

Convincing: Although the Lakewood Church says that it is aware of the hoax and 'false rumours', no one has claimed responsibility for the prank

Pastor Joel Osteen's sermons reach over seven million broadcast media viewers weekly in more than 100 nations around the world.

His popularity saw him featured as one of ABC News' 10 Most Fascinating People of 2006 and he was also named Most Influential Christian in America in 2006 by The Church Report.

Mr Osteen has written more than 20 books and has been criticised in the past for his apparently lavish lifestyle.
