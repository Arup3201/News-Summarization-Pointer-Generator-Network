George Groves is a 'fraud' who does not deserve a shot at the WBC world title, according to the current champion Anthony Dirrell.

Londoner Groves makes his return to the ring on Saturday when he faces Christopher Rebrasse at Wembley Arena in his first fight since being knocked out by Carl Froch in their record-breaking clash on May 31st.

On the line is the European super-middleweight title as well as the nominal WBC silver strap – but most importantly, the winner will become the mandatory challenger to American Dirrell.

But the 29-year-old, who won the belt by beating Sakio Bika in California last month, says Groves is not a worthy challenger even if he takes care of little-known Frenchman Rebrasse on Saturday.

Talking exclusively to Sportsmail, Dirrell said: 'Who is this French guy? Seriously I've never heard of him. How can Groves fight him and then be my mandatory? He's a fraud.

'He wants a fight with me? He's just lost twice to Froch. Tell him he needs to fight someone in the top 10. He's fighting a bum.

'I won this belt the hard way and now he thinks he's going to get a shot without fighting anyone. It's not going to happen.'

Groves, meanwhile, has been sent a letter from the WBC stating that the winner of Saturday's bout at Wembley Arena, just across the road from the Stadium where he was brutally stopped by Froch, will be guaranteed a shot at Dirrell.

That means 'The Dog' will have to either face 'The Saint' or vacate the title.

Groves and his promoters, Team Sauerland, will do all they can to get any world title challenge on home soil, but Dirrell insists he will not be crossing the Atlantic to face Groves.

Dirrell says Groves' defeats to Froch, who also beat Dirrell's brother, means he doesn't deserve a title shot

Dirrell's older brother, Andre, was beaten by Froch on a split decision in Nottingham back in 2009 – incidentally for the same WBC belt currently held by his sibling.

And it's a decision which still rankles with the younger Dirrell. He added: 'Everyone saw what happened to my brother, he got a bad deal in the UK. It's in the past now but that doesn't mean I'll let the same thing happen to me.

'There's no way I'll be going to the UK. I'm the champ. If they make Groves the No.1 contender then he's going to have to come here and try and beat me. And he won't do it.

'I won't be giving him a shot in his own country. Everyone knows what happens over there - I won't be going over there to fight.'

Champion Dirrell said that if he does have to fight Groves the Eglishman is going to have to cross the Atlantic

And in a further taunt to Groves, Dirrell revealed he would rather try to avenge his brother's loss and set up a super-middleweight unification fight with WBA and IBF king Froch, who is still yet to decide his next move following his victory at Wembley.

Dirrell said: 'The Froch fight would be an option. I want to fight the best - and George Groves is not the best.

'Froch though, he's one of the top guys, a good fighter who has beaten Groves twice in a row, he's more deserving but we don't know what he's doing yet.

'We got to wait and see. Anthony wants another shot at him but if the money was right then I would love that fight.'

Dirrell's last WBC Super Middleweight World Championship fight was against Sakio Bika last month
