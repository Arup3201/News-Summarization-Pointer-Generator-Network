Lord Sugar has been accused of homophobia after asking a Twitter user who insulted him when he planned to 'come out'.

The Apprentice star responded angrily when William Bridges aimed a tweet at him which read: '@Lord_Sugar you are thick as s***'.

The 66-year-old retorted with asking the man when he 'planned to come out' after referring to Bridges' Twitter profile picture, in which he was pictured with a friend.

The ex-Spurs chairman tweeted: 'Your twitter pic. When are you 2 coming out?'.

War of words: The Twitter row descended into a bitter flurry of insults from the businessman

He then branded him a 't***' and called another Twitter user a 'dimwit' when they accused him of being homophobic.

The Labour peer agreed with people who said others were needlessly trying to make it into a row over sexuality.

He called another Twitter user a 't***' for saying that they were 'disappointed' that the entrepreneur had used 'sexuality as an insult'.

Lord Sugar called followers who accused him of homophobia a 't***'

When one person said the insult was homophobic, Sugar replied: 'you dimwit refer to original insult from sender before you stand high and mighty'.

Despite the outraged responses to his insult, the TV presenter remained defiant and refused to apologise.

The original Twitter user who had insulted him has now deleted his account.

It's not the first time that the businessman has come under fire for his Twitter account.

In October Lord Sugar was investigated by police after being accused of posting a racist Twitter message.

The outspoken entrepreneur and Apprentice star posted a photograph of a crying Chinese child to 3.2 million Twitter followers, joking that the youngster was upset after being told off for leaving Apple’s iPhone production line – a reference to the Asian factories where the phones are made.

The tweet prompted a single complaint to the Metropolitan Police from a Twitter user, who referred to the Labour peer as a ‘vile racist’.

Police contacted the complainant twice, urging her to make a statement at a police station, which she eventually did, and yesterday police confirmed that officers from Merseyside’s Hate Crime Investigation Unit took several days to decide whether a crime had been committed by the Labour peer’s tweet.

However, the remark was in the end classed as a ‘hate incident’ – which means no further action will be taken, although details will be kept on file.
