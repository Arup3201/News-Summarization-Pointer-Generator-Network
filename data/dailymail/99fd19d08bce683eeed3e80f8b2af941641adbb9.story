A mother of two from Massachusetts says a JetBlue flight attendant did nothing to help when her 3-year-old had a bathroom emergency on the plane - and then publicly humiliated her when the child could not hold it in.

Jennifer Devereaux, a photographer from West Newton, was returning home from New York Monday when she says the 30-minute trip aboard JetBlue Flight 518 turned into a nightmare for her and her two daughters. 

The plane was sitting on the tarmac at John F Kennedy International Airport for about 30 minutes when Devereaux's daughter Summer said she needed to use the restroom.

The mother asked a flight attendant if her toddler could use the bathroom, but in response the woman allegedly 'snapped' at Devereaux, ordering her to 'sit down.'

But little Summer could not wait any longer and ended up relieving herself in her seat.

‘It wasn’t about bad customer service at that point, it was about bad human decency. My daughter was sitting in a pool of urine and I couldn’t do anything about it,’ Deveraux told CBS Boston. ‘And as a mom it just broke my heart.’

The married mother of two had no napkins or towels on hand, so she was forced to use her own sweater to soak up the mess.

As she was trying to tidy up, Mrs Devereaux said the flight attendant yelled at her.

‘And I said, “Please give me a break. My daughter had an accident because you wouldn’t let me take her to the bathroom. After I clean it up I will sit down.” She turned around and reported it to the pilot,’ said Devereaux.

As the plane was turned around and returned to the gate, the captain’s voice came on the PA system announcing that there is a non-compliant passenger who will be removed by security guards.

Jennifer Devereaux, who was traveling alone with her two daughters, grew fearful, but fortunately for her an off-duty pilot who was sitting in front of her was able to convince his colleagues in the cockpit to let her stay.

Upon returning home to West Newton, the mother of two penned a complaint to the airline demanding an apology for the flight crew's behavior towards her family.

JetBlue responded with a statement saying that they are investigating the incident.

Mrs Devereaux also took to Twitter, saying that in the 10 years she has been flying JetBlue, Monday's trip was the worst experience of her life.

She also called on the airline to fire the flight attendant, whom she identified as 'Karen,’ for treating her family 'like garbage.'

The company tweeted back at Devereaux, apologizing for failing to provide her 'the JetBlue experience' and asking to hear more details.

In a later tweet, JetBlue promised to have a customer representative reach out to her as soon as possible.

‘They can't treat kids and families like this,’ she told the station WCVB. ’It's completely crazy.’

Other Twitter users came to the mother’s defense, calling out the airline for the staffer’s conduct.

In response to a tweet by user Greg Zollo, who inquired if it was a normal operating procedure to have a 3-year-old pee in the seat, JetBlue responded that they are bound by very strict FAA regulations when a plane is on the tarmac. 

Jennifer Devereaux said JetBlue eventually offered her a $50 credit, but it will likely go unused since she has vowed never to fly with the airline again.
