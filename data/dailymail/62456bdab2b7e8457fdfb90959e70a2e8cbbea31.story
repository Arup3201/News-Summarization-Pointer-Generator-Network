Hundreds of teachers are spending all or part of their time on union work, costing taxpayers £15million a year.

Some union representatives are paid teaching salaries of up to £70,000 yet many have not taken a class for years, a survey has shown.

Their salaries are paid by local authorities and schools receive no extra money to cover for the union reps – meaning  they have less to spend on educating pupils.

Conflict: Michael Gove has been at war with teaching unions over pay and pensions

Under the system, trade union 
officials can take ‘reasonable’ paid time off for union work, known as 
facilities time, such as  representing members in employment disputes.

But the definition of what is reasonable is wide open to interpretation.

Now the Department for Education is to investigate the issue at a time when Education Secretary Michael Gove is effectively at war with the two biggest teachers’ unions over pay and conditions.

The DfE said it was taking action due to demands by local authorities and headteachers and insisted the timing was coincidental.

A source said: ‘The view is by the end of the year we will be issuing robust advice.’

The situation has also created vast differences in the amount of money being diverted to union causes.

The Department for Education, headed by Michael Gove, has said it will issue robust guidance on the issue

A TaxPayers’ Alliance survey of public
 funding for all unions last year found Birmingham, which has 1.1million
 residents, spends £458,000 for ten full-time equivalent education reps.
 Yet Kent, with a population of 1.5million, diverts around £144,000.

The
 study suggested that, overall, at least £14.5million is spent on more 
than 427 full-time equivalent posts each year. Official figures have 
never been compiled.

NUT General Secretary Christine Blower has said that the representative are essential

Schools minister David Laws yesterday signalled at least half of union reps’ time should be spent teaching. ‘It is reasonable to expect all trade union representatives in schools to spend the majority of their working hours carrying out school-based jobs.

‘They should not be spending all their taxpayer-funded time out of the classroom.’

The DfE said there were no plans to change the rules but said it was necessary to clarify how they are implemented.

It added: ‘A large number of union representatives are paid as teachers but do not spend any of their contracted time teaching.

‘This creates additional work for the very many hardworking teachers across the country.

'Some of these local, regional and national union representatives have not taught in a school for many years.

'This represents a significant cost to the taxpayer of many millions of pounds.’

The National Union of Teachers and NASUWT, which represent 90 per cent of teachers between them, have been holding regional strikes over issues including payrise caps, the introduction of performance-related pay and changes to pensions.

Two more are planned next month before a national walk-out nearer the end of this term.

NUT general secretary Christine Blower said union reps were essential for maintaining good relationships between employers and employees.

She added: ‘We will of course take part in the review to present the excellent case for maintaining facilities time.’

Russell Hobby, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘It is not for the government to specify how unions should organise themselves.’

Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The schools budget should be spent on educating our children, not subsidising unions.’
