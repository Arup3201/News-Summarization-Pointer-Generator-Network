Goals from Andrew Surman and Ryan Fraser gave new Sky Bet Championship leaders Bournemouth a 2-0 victory at Sheffield Wednesday that extended their winning run to seven games.

Following a fairly even first 45 minutes, the turning point came in the 60th minute when Wednesday's Royston Drenthe was dismissed after receiving a second yellow card.

Surman and Fraser scored soon afterwards and the hosts never threatened to mount a comeback.

Drenthe was in the thick of the action early on, firstly seeing his 20-yard effort comfortably saved by Artur Boruc and then having a defected long-range shot kept out by the visiting keeper.

The home side continued to have the better of the opening exchanges with Giles Coke's long-range shot deflected wide and Jacques Maghoma trying an effort from distance which was saved.

Coke also headed wide before Bournemouth enjoyed a good spell.

The Cherries' first real opening came when Simon Francis' low cross found Callum Wilson whose shot was saved by Keiren Westwood, with the keeper gathering the ball at the second attempt.

Marc Pugh then put a rising shot over while Matt Ritchie had a low shot saved.

Maghoma put a fierce shot off-target before the visitors threatened again.

Wilson found himself in space inside the area and will have been disappointed to have screwed his shot wide.

Ritchie then tested Westwood with a firm drive which was well saved by the keeper, who dived to his left to turn the ball wide.

Wilson wasted another good opportunity when he missed the target from a good position inside the area after Brett Pitman ran at the heart of the defence and slipped the ball to him.

Wednesday were reduced to 10 men on the hour mark when Drenthe was shown the red card after picking up his second booking for a foul.

Bournemouth soon made the numerical advantage count when Wilson found Surman, who picked his spot to score with a measured finish.

The visitors went further ahead four minutes later when Westwood was left exposed by his defence and Wilson squared to substitute Fraser who scored with ease.

The Wednesday players wilted after the second goal went in and posed no problems for the Bournemouth rear-guard.

Cherries substitute Yann Kermorgant had a late chance to make the victory more comprehensive, but he shot well over the bar.

Bournemouth's impressive recent run continues with just one defeat in their last 10 games.

Wednesday, meanwhile, have now gone eight games without a win.
