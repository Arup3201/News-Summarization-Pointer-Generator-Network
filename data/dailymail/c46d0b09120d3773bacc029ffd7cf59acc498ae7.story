Shrien Dewani, the British businessman accused of ordering his wife's killing on their honeymoon in 2010, has appeared in court in South Africa.

A judge in Pretoria set October 6 as the start date for his trial and ordered more psychological examinations to be carried out over 30 days to asses his fitness to stand.

Dewani fought extradition for three years on the grounds that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress and depression in relation to the death of his wife, Anni.

In court today, a clean-shaven Dewani, wearing a 
black suit and white shirt, was brought up from the holding cells for five minutes before being led back down.

'We have no doubt that he is fit to 
plead,' defence lawyer Francois van Zyl said.

Anni died after being shot in the neck during an allegedly staged car-jacking on the outskirts of Cape Town in November 2010 while she and Shrien were on their honeymoon.

The 34-year-old was implicated in his wife's death by three co-accused who agreed to testify for the state in exchange for lesser sentences. He has denied any involvement in the killing.

Relatives attended the hearing for Dewani inside the court, where it was determined that he will stand trial starting on October 6

Dewani's father, Prakesh, was in court today to hear that his son will go on trail on October 6, almost four years after his wife Anni was killed in November 2010

Dewani's family, including brother Preyen (right), saw him for five minutes as he was brought out of the holding cells. The judge also ordered more psychiatric tests

Millionaire businessman Dewani faces a minimum of 25 years if found guilty.

The
 Western Cape High Court heard last month that his condition had 
improved but he would remain in Valkenberg Hospital in Cape Town, with 
the case being adjourned to today.

Dewani,
 from Bristol, was extradited from the UK in April to face trial charged
 with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating 
circumstances, murder, kidnapping, and defeating the ends of justice.

In the pre-trial conference at court 
on May 12, Francois van Zyl told how his client had fared in his month 
as a hospital patient.

He 
said: 'I am informed that he has been fully co-operative and that his 
condition has improved. We have been told by treating psychiatrists not 
to consult with him for longer than 30 minutes at a time.'

He said Dewani lacked the ability to 
concentrate for longer than this time but he remained hopeful that his 
client would improve enough to 'instruct us properly'.

Dewani's family were in court today to support the businessman who faces 25 years in jail if he is convicted

It is the South African state's case 
that he conspired with Cape Town residents Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe
 and Xolile Mngeni to kill his wife.

Tongo, Qwabe, and Mngeni are already serving jail terms in connection with the murder. Dewani has not yet been asked to plead.

He claimed he and his wife Anni were kidnapped at gunpoint as they drove through Gugulethu in Cape Town in a taxi in November 2010.

The couple had been on honeymoon in the country. He was released unharmed, but his wife's body was found in the abandoned car the next day. She had been shot dead.

The South African authorities have been waiting for more than three years to get Dewani into the dock.
