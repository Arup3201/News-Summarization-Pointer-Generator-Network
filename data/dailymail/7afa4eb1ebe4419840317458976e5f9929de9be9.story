The neo-Nazi who killed six worshippers at a Sikh temple on Sunday morning died after turning the gun on himself, it was revealed today.

It was originally believed that Wade Michael Page had been killed by a police officer who was wounded after responding to the shooting.

Special agent Teresa Carlson told reporters in Milwaukee that the 41-year-old gunman shot himself in the head after the second police officer responding to the scene shot him in the stomach.

The disturbing moment was caught on camera. A motive has not yet been given for the senseless massacre.

Violence and hate: Wade Michael Page turned the gun on himself after being shot in the stomach by a responding police officer

Felon: Misty Cook, the former girlfriend of 
Wisconsin Sikh temple shooter Wade Page, has been arrested after police 
found a gun at her home

Oak Creek Police Officer Sam
Lenda - the second officer who 
responded to the scene - has been credited with shooting Page in the stomach.

'It is an amazing shot and thank goodness,' Carlson said today.

The first responding officer, Lt Brian Murphy, was 
shot nine times but survived the shooting.

Oak Creek Police Chief John 
Edwards said at the news conference that Murphy has started walking 
around again.

Carlson said the FBI had received 101 leads 'worldwide' during its 
investigation but reaffirmed that no one else other than Page has been 
connected to the shooting.

It comes on the same day as Page's 
former girlfriend Misty Cook, from Milwaukee, was arrested after a gun 
was found at her home. She and Page were said to have broken up shortly 
before the Wisconsin massacre.

Wade Page was said to have harboured white supremacist views and would rant 
about a 'racial holy war', according to an old friend of his from the army.

The gunman was a 
'gentle young man' when growing up, according to his mother - but by the
time he enlisted in the Army in Milwaukee in 1992, he was already a 
neo-Nazi sympathiser.

Christopher Robillard, another former
soldier, told CNN that Page was his 'closest friend' in the military, 
but that even then he had troubling political beliefs.

The future killer was 'a very kind, 
very smart individual' who 'loved his friends', according to Mr 
Robillard, who added that Page was 'one of those guys with a soft spot'.

But Mr Robillard said that his friend
was 'involved with white supremacy,' and continued: 'He would talk 
about the racial holy war, like he wanted it to come.

'But to me, he didn't seem like the type of person to go out and hurt people.

'I never pictured him as someone who would do anything. I thought maybe he was just saying it for attention.'

After Page was discharged from the 
Army in 1998 for turning up drunk at parade, he apparently moved to 
Denver, where he 'was basically living on the streets'.

During this difficult time, according
to Mr Robillard, Page became more involved in the supremacist movement,
joining his first racist band - but the group kicked him out after his 
girlfriend left him for a bandmate.

Mr Robillard began to lose touch with
his fellow veteran, and could not understand the increasing violence of
Page's political views.

'I asked him why he was aligning himself with this stuff,' he said. 'He really didn't answer. He would duck it.'

Page's mother Laura Lynn told the 
MailOnline that she has had no contact with her son since she and his 
father Jesse Alvin Page divorced.

She said: 'He was such a precious little boy, 
that's all I can say, he was a very fun-loving, typical little boy. He was 
just a very soft spoken, gentle young man.'

Asked if the army had changed her son, she said: 'I have no idea I had not been in contact
with him that much. Actually in the last 12 years I have not been in 
contact with him at all since his dad and I divorced.

'I just found out this morning when another newspaper called me. Of course I'm devastated.

'My heart goes out to all the people who lost 
their loved ones, that's all I can say, I am so sorry.'

Gunman: Former solider Wade Michael Page is said to be a frustrated 
neo-Nazi who had been the leader of a racist white-power band called End Apathy

Home: Page moved recently to a duplex in the 3700 block of E. Holmes in Cudahy which was cordoned off for a time on Sunday night as officials investigated inside, and residents were evacuated from their homes

Victim: The president of the temple, Satwant Kaleka, was shot by the gunman as he tried to tackle him to the floor with a knife

Loss: Mohan Singh Khatra, who lost his uncle

Hero: Lieutenant Brian Murphy shot dead Wade Michael Page at the Sikh temple, despite himself being shot eight or nine times. He is currently recovering in hospital

The
Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that has studied hate crimes for 
decades, reported on Monday they had been tracking Page since 2000.

Also
on Monday, a volunteer human-rights group called Responsible for 
Equality And Liberty (R.E.A.L.) found links between Page, his band and a
white supremacist website called Stormfront, reported the Journal 
Sentinel.

Page moved to
a duplex in the 3700 block of E. Holmes in Cudahy two weeks ago, which 
was cordoned off for a time on Sunday night as officials investigated 
inside, and residents were evacuated from their homes.

It is about six miles from the temple where the shooting took place.
