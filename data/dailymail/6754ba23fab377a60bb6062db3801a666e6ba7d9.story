Adventurous World Cup fans have slept in favelas in Brazil, campsites in South Africa and airports or train stations around the globe while following their national teams around a host country.

They will have another unusual choice when the colossal event is staged in Russia in 2018.

To accommodate an influx of tourists in Saransk, one of 11 host cities, there are plans to set up a 'portable hotel' during the 32-day tournament.

Special delivery: Snoozebox has signed a preliminary deal to provide a 'portable hotel' for a World Cup city

Pop-up hotel: The modified shipping containers can be stacked to accommodate more guests

FIFA World Cup organisers in the city 400 miles east of Moscow have signed a preliminary deal with London-based Snoozebox to provide a temporary complex called Snoozebox Football Village, the Moscow Times reported.

The pop-up hotel – a series of modified shipping containers that can be stacked on top of each other – will have 2,000 rooms and be situated on the shore of the Lukhovka reservoir in the city of 300,000.

The reservoir is located near Saransk Airport and about 10 minutes from the site of a 45,000-seat stadium that is being built for the World Cup.

To keep visitors busy, Snoozebox Football Village will include restaurants, shops, a large screen that will show World Cup matches, and venues for entertainment and recreation, Interfax reported.

Snoozebox guest rooms include two beds, an en-suite wet room, wireless internet access, a safe, flat screen television and key card entry.

Location, location, location: The portable hotel in Saransk will be set up 10 minutes from a World Cup stadium

The UK company has provided temporary hotels for travellers at a number of major events, including the London 2012 Games, Glastonbury Festival and this summer’s Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games in Normandy, France.

As it is with every World Cup, the availability of affordable accommodation is one of the concerns for tourists and organisers.

Fans will also face vast distances between host cities in a country that is facing increasing doubts about whether it should be allowed to host the tournament, given the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine and long-standing complaints about racism and anti-gay discrimination.
