The Christmas Day revelations of life for German prisoners of war in 1917 were contained in the diary of German Army officer Johannes Rienau

It was a Christmas Day to savour.

A festive feast including game and lobster, a sing song amongst friends relaxing in front of a cosy fire and of course the giving of gifts.

Astonishingly, this was how German prisoners of war spent Christmas in 1917 at a luxurious camp in the Yorkshire Dales.

While their comrades were being slaughtered in the trenches, the captured soldiers enjoyed snow ball fights, tobogganing and even ‘yodelling.’

For the 500 or so men held at Breary Banks camp at Colsterdale, the terrors of the Western Front were quickly forgotten.

Fascinating details of life in the cushy camp have emerged througha long lost journal kept by German Army officer Johannes Rienau. He joined up in 1915, aged 19, and was taken prisoner in April 1917.

Rienau soon discovered life as a prisoner was far better. Instead of fighting, prisoners indulged in a variety of leisure activities.

As well as music, art classes and a library of 800 books, there were football, hockey and volleyball matches on the prison sports field. The camp was for officers – along with some orderlies to tend to their needs – and they weren’t put to work at all. 

Christmas was a magical time. Rienau wrote: ‘Outside there still lies deep and gleaming snow. This morning on the way to breakfast all stood spellbound at the splendid scene. It was a snowscape more glittering, brilliant and stirring than I have ever seen.

‘Snow ball fights carry on. In the south of the camp, tobogganing is taking place with much yodeling with primitive sleds or benches or tables. The snow balling has so far cost us a number of window panes.’

Christmas Day began in the early hours when a ‘quartet of orderlies gave a serenade to the whole camp.’

The soldier recorded how the camp commandant greeted prisoners at morning roll call with: ‘I wish you all a merry Christmas.’

On Boxing Day he wrote how they had spent Christmas in front of coal fires in their huts.

‘Having a rest – doing nothing,’ he recorded. ‘On Christmas Eve, one of my comrades finally received his guitar from his aunt in London. So yesterday morning we played in time together from the new guitar book.’

Lunch for the inmates comprised of ‘game with red cabbage and other fine things.’ These included Stollen – a traditional German fruit cake – and coffee.

There was more to come. Rienau wrote: ‘On Christmas Day evening, we dined once more to excess – lobster in mayonnaise, spinach and scrambled egg, bread, cheese, and dripping and a cup of coffee. Then presentation of gifts to the orderlies.’

Regular food parcels from home also kept the prisoners supplied with chocolate cake, cocoa, honey, sweets, stock cubes, sugar and flour to supplement their generous prisoner rations.

The officers even had their own camp bakery and vegetable plots on site.

There were plenty of activities to exercise both body and mind. Rienau continued: ‘My body has been put back to rights. Volleyball in the morning, football in the afternoon.’ He also wrote: ‘After morning parade, I fought out a match of the long running chess tournament. The first game was lost the second was won with checkmate. ‘Outside hockey is being played. I have only taken part one so far, as goalkeeper.’

Dr Jonathan Finch, of York University, who has been piecing together the history of the Breary Banks camp at Colsterdale, said it was the best camp in the country in terms of lifestyle and conditions

Set on grassy slopes in picturesque countryside, the camp was originally set up in 1903 for 700 workers constructing local reservoirs.

The Leeds Pals Regiment was posted there early in World War One before it became a POW camp.

Dr Jonathan Finch, of York University, who has been piecing together the history of the site, said it was the best camp in the country in terms of lifestyle and conditions.

He said: ‘It had piped water, electric lights and it was like a mini town or village, with all the mod cons of the time.’ When the first German prisoners arrived in January 1917 ‘they were virtually starving,’ he said.

‘There were two distinct types of officer. There were those who were very eager to find out how the war was going. But there was another group, including artists and musicians, who were glad to be out of the fray.’

A Red Cross report in 1917 stated ‘a certain chivalrous attitude is maintained between the British officers and the prisoners’ and named it as the ‘best camp’ for officer POWs in the country.

After the Armistice, Rienau became a tutor and then took up ecclesiastical work back in Germany. His diary was inherited by Chris Taylor, from York, the grandson of one of the prison guards.

He had the hand-written diary translated into English and later returned it to Rienau’s three children back in Germany - where the former soldier had died in 1971.
