Roberto Mancini wants to get back into the Champions League with Inter by winning this season’s Europa League – but insists his new team must become more attacking.

The former Manchester City manager has returned to San Siro, where he won three Scudettos between 2004 and 2008, and earned a 1-1 draw with city rivals AC in his first match back.

Mancini admitted he does not know a good number of his squad aside from watching television but that he must get results quickly.

Inter are currently ninth in Serie A, five points behind Napoli in third, but four points clear at the top of group F in the Europa League. For the first time winning that competition means entry into the Champions League.

‘The tactical aspect of the team needs to be changed but I don’t even know a lot of them, just from TV, so I need to get to know them. The attitude was right so I’m happy about that,’ Mancini said after the draw against AC.

‘We have a lot of things to do. This Inter has been built up for a certain type of game with no offensive strength so now we have to change. And a lot of the players have to sacrifice their role in order to sustain this type of team.

‘There are two ways to qualify for the Champions League, one is arriving because we are in a good place in the Championship, or we win the Europa League. But it is still a long way.

‘I’ve had some very tough times in the last 48 hours, when you arrive like this, and start with the derby, you have no certainties. We have tried different tactical schemes but I changed them at the very last, it has been very engaging in the last two days.

‘For what comes next we’ll do our best as soon as we can, football has narrow times.’

Mancini kept Nemanja Vidic on the bench throughout. ‘I know Vidic very well even if he plays on the other side of Manchester,’ said Mancini. ‘He will be very helpful to this Inter side soon.’
