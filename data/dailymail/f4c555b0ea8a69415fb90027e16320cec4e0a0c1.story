A man known as 'Wolf Boy' because of a rare condition that gives him hair all over his face will perform at a 'freak show' in the UK.

Wolf Boy Jesus 'Chuy' Aceves, from Mexico joins the new Circus of Horrors Show at Wookey Hole in Somerset today and tomorrow for its Halloween special, which will then tour Europe.

Jesus has a condition known as Hyper Trichosis, which affects very few people in the world.

He is the first Wolf Boy to set foot in Great Britain for 30 years and his arrival has been a closely guarded secret.

The Circus of Horrors reached the finals of Britain's Got Talent last year.

Judge Simon Cowell said: 'I loved it and I'm sure the royal family would love to watch this’, while David Hasselhof added: 'Fantastic, that’s what I call entertainment'.

The self proclaimed freak show, which has a Berlin in the 1920s theme, brands itself as 'hair-raising entertainment and bloodthirsty burlesque'.

It is famous for its gruesome stunts, including Garry Stretch and his record-breaking elastic skin, contortionists, acrobats and The Dwarf Demon Dan, who had to have surgery to remove a vacuum cleaner hose after he tried to drag the appliance with his genitals during a 2007 show.

The show's website proclaims: 'If Quentin Tarantino had directed Cirque Du Soleil then you would be only half way there.'

A total of 24 people in the football fan's family have the condition, with varying degrees of severity, inlcuding his sister Lili and his cousins Danny and Larry.

His daughter daughter Carla is one of them.

Hypertrichosis (also called Ambras syndrome) is an abnormal amount of hair growth on the body. Extensive cases of hypertrichosis have informally been called 'Werewolf Syndrome'.

Hypertrichosis can be either present at birth or acquired later in life.

Several circus sideshow performers in the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Julia Pastrana, had hypertrichosis. Many of them worked as freaks and were promoted as having distinct human and animal traits.

The first recorded case of hypertrichosis was Petrus Gonsalvus of the Canary Islands in 1648. Two daughters, a son, and a grandchild in Gonzales' family all had the condition.

Macabre: The Circus of Horrors is a self-proclaimed freak show. But does it bring back memories of the fairground tradition in which crowds once flocked to gawp at victims of deformities?
