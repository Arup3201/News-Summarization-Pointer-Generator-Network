Incoming New York Times chief executive Mark Thompson has been drawn into a scandal surrounding a late British television presenter who is believed to have sexually abused children.

Mr Thompson, who is due to start his new role next month, was director-general of Britain's public broadcaster, the BBC, when its Newsnight current affairs programme dropped an investigation into allegations against Jimmy Savile.

Savile, the eccentric host of the BBC's Top Of The Pops music show, died in October last year at the age of 84. Police have since described him as one of Britain's worst sex offenders.

Mr Thompson, who left the BBC after eight years last month, today said he would be happy to give evidence to British politicians investigating the scandal.

He denied any knowledge of the details of Newsnight's investigation into Savile.

He said he only learned about the planned documentary at a party last December when another journalist told him: 'You must be worried about the Newsnight investigation.'

Mr Thompson said he did not ask for any more details, but made informal enquiries from BBC News the next day and was told that the programme had been dropped for 'journalistic reasons'.

He added that he did not ask what allegations against Savile were being investigated, and only found out about them almost a year later after he had stood down from the BBC.

After Savile died, BBC journalists for the Newsnight programme spent six weeks investigating allegations that the presenter abused pupils at a school in Surrey, south-east England.

They spoke to at least four women who claimed they had been abused or knew about abuse at the school, but the programme never aired.

More allegations came to light when a rival British broadcaster, ITV, aired a programme about Savile's behaviour.

British police have received a flood of claims since the ITV documentary was shown, and more than 200 alleged victims have come forward.

'Exceptionally grave': Mr Thompson denied any knowledge of the Newsnight investigation in a letter to Conservative politician Rob Wilson (pictured)

It is alleged that Savile abused victims in hospitals and on BBC premises.

Details of Newsnight's aborted investigation into Savile were revealed on Monday in another television documentary, Panorama, shown on the BBC.

In a letter to the Conservative MP Rob Wilson, Mr Thompson described the claims about Savile as ‘exceptionally grave’ but said that the Director-General very rarely became involved in investigations before they were broadcast.

He said: 'Given the many hundreds of investigations the BBC does every year, the personal involvement of the DG (Director-General) in a given investigation would inevitably be unusual and noteworthy and could therefore have a distorting or chilling effect on the journalism involved.’

The Newsnight expose was also not in a list of 'potentially sensitive programmes' drawn up as part of BBC’s editorial policy as far as he could recall, he said.

Mr Thompson added that, during his time as Director-General of the BBC, he never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Savile, adding: ‘His name scarcely came up at all.’

He said he finally heard about the claims when the ITV programme was publicised last month, after he had left the BBC..

This was despite reports about the BBC's decision to drop the Newsnight investigation having previously appeared in five newspapers, including the Daily Mail.
