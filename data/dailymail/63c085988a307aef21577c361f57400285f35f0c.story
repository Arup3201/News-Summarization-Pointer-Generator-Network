Clutching onto her relatives in heartbreaking despair, an anguished mother climbs into her son's grave, grief etched across her tear-stained face.

Just moments earlier, she had watched mourners desperately cling onto her child's coffin as it passed through their close-knit mining village, lovingly draped in a Turkish flag.

Her son was among 18 workers who were trapped 11 days ago, when water surged through a coal mine in Karaman, southern Turkey. 

Today, emotional scenes unfolded as the community of Asagi Caglar in Karaman, came together to bid farewell to two of the victims.

Her son was one of the 18 workers who were trapped 11 days ago when a water flooded a coal mine in Karaman, southern Turkey 

The relatives were visibly distressed as the community came together to pay their respects to two of the victims, whose bodies were retrieved from the mine yesterday 

Family members and friends clutched onto the coffins as they passed through the village, draped in the red and white Turkish flag

The service came less than 24 hours after authorities pulled the bodies - the first two to have been retrieved since the accident - from the Has Sekerler mine in the Ermenek district of the town.

As mourners stood together in visible grief, two politicians reached across to console Sukru Haznedar, the father of miner Kerim Haznedar, one of those killed in the disaster.

Lutfi Elvan, Turkey's transport, maritime affairs and communications minister and the minister of energy and natural resources Taner Yildiz were among those paying their respects. 

The miners were trapped more than 1,000ft below ground on October 28 after a sudden flood.

Rescue teams, including divers, have continued their work at the mine, amid efforts to pump out 12,000 tons of water from the mine.

But, within hours of the tragedy, hopes had all but faded that any of the trapped workers would be rescued.

A huge crowd gathered to offer prayers for the miners during their funerals. Their deaths have left the community heartbroken 

Mourners carry the coffins of the two miners. Their funerals came 11 days after the incident, which unfolded when the workers were trapped 300 metres underground 

Energy minister Taner Yildiz told reporters that the level of the water that flooded the mine had surpassed the area were the miners were situated, just hours after the incident.

There has been no contact with the 18 men since they were trapped.  

The flood occurred around 3 p.m  when
workers were eating their lunch at the site, which is about 70 miles north of Turkey's Mediterranean coastline.

It was the second major industrial accident at a Turkish
mine in six months.

Turkey's deadliest disaster occurred in May
in the western town of Soma, where 301 miners were killed.

The disaster sparked violent protests across Turkey, directed at mine owners accused of ignoring safety for profit. 

Governor Murat Koca said the incident occurred at the Has Sekerler mine near the town of Ermenek in Karaman province, 300 miles south of Ankara close to Turkey's Mediterranean coast

There was also outrage directed at Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government, which is seen as being too close to industry bosses.

The incident exposed poor safety standards and superficial government inspections in many of the country's mines.

It also exposed the country's shoddy worker
safety record. Hundreds of labourers die every year. 

The incident led to more than two dozen arrests
