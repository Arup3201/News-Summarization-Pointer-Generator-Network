An acrobat has taken his risk-taking a little bit higher - by performing an incredible handstand 24-storey up a tower block in Singapore.

Conor Friedmann-Kenny captured the terrifying view from the high rise building using a camera attached to his ankle.

The 22-year-old, who is from London, is training to be a stunt man - but gets his thrills travelling the world to perform flips and tricks.

With years of training under his belt, Conor control is clear as he moves into a handstand position 

But warning copycats against replicating his daredevil stunt he posted on YouTube, he says: 'I would just like to take a minute to explain, this for me is in no way a risk.

'I have been training my body and mind for years to achieve just this and I am in no way doing these 'stunts' just for views or likes.

'I am doing them for myself and to push my mind and body past the limitations that we put on ourselves in day to day life.'

Conor has been performing as a professional acrobat for the five years and also competed in gymnastics and cheerleading.

He has appeared in adverts and television shows including BBC's Tumble, where celebrities take a leap into the world of professional gymnastics.

He's also taken part in London's Olympic opening and closing ceremonies. 

He adds: 'I absolutely love my life and strive continually to improve myself and my skills. 

'This career path I have chosen is exhilarating and exciting and allows me to see the world which continually forces me to adapt, overcome and strive for perfection in everything I do.'

Conor, who is training to be a stunt man, holds the position for about 30 seconds before dropping back down
