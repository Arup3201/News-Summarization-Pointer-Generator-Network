Ryan Giggs has played down suggestions that Manchester United should retire their number 11 shirt to mark his 23-year career.

Giggs wore the number throughout his time at Old Trafford, as he won 13 Premier League titles with United, as well as two Champions Leagues.

He retired at the end of last season, and wants a new player to make the shirt their own now that he has become part of the coaching staff under new boss Louis van Gaal.

Number 11: Giggs has had the shirt since United introduced squad numbers in 1993

Fan favourite: Giggs has been extremely popular with the Old Trafford crowd during his career

'There are obviously special cases but it just depends on the club really,' Giggs told Manchester United's TV channel MUTV.

'I don't think it's [right] for United where they constantly churn over great players.

'I haven't thought about who will take over the number 11 shirt - that's a good question. 'They're under pressure, aren't they?!'

Precedent: Legends like Paolo Maldini (left) and Bobby Moore have had their number retired at other clubs

'I look forward to seeing who takes it and wish them all the best.'

Giggs often wore the number 11 in his early career, but set squad numbers were not introduced until 1993 - he wore it every season subsequently.

Clubs that have retired shirts for legends include West Ham, who retired Bobby Moore's number six, and AC Milan, who no longer use the number three in honour of Paolo Maldini.
