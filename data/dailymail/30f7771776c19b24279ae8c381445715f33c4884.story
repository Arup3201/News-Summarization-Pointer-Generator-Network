A wildlife photographer has accused Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher of re-processing his image of a monkey holding a mobile phone and posting it to Twitter.

Marsel van Oosten from Holland snapped the picture of the Japanese macaque, who stole the phone from a tourist, who got too close to the animal.

The picture, has now helped Mr van Oosten earn a nomination in the Natural History Museum's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition.

But earlier this month, the Two and a Half Men star, posted the picture to his own official Facebook page, with the caption, 'always working'.

According to Mr van Oosten, the image was reprocessed with the actor adding his own watermark and not crediting him as the photographer.

Mr van Oosten tweeted: 'Ashton Kutcher stole my picture, re-processed it, removed my watermark, and then added his own.'

On the photographer's Facebook page, he went into more detail, explaining: 'Interesting. Ashton Kutcher - the actor from Two and a Half Men, and the guy that plays Steve Jobs in the movie Jobs - has posted a filtered version of my snow monkey image on his FB page.

Mr van Oosten took to Twitter after realising the actor had used his picture, removed his watermark and added his own

'I am not credited as the photographer. However, there is a tiny watermark near the bottom of the frame: aplusk.

'I just found out that aplusk is Ashton Kutcher's screen name on Twitter and Instagram. In other words, Kutcher has personally re-processed my picture and then added his own watermark. WTF?'

However, the picture now appears to have been taken down from the actor's official page.

Mailonline has contacted the actor's representatives.

The picture of the macaque is one of 50 that have been shortlisted by the Wildlife Photographer of the Year jury.

Members of the public are now being asked to vote for their favourite, with the voting closing on September 5 and the winner announced in October.
