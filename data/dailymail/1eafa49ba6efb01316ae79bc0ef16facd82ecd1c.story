A horse riding charity is helping wounded British soldiers to cope with their injuries - by teaching them cowboy skills.

They invited servicemen and women coping with amputated limbs or psychological problems after serving in a war zone to spend a few weeks in the beautiful surroundings of Aboyne, Aberdeenshire.

During the course they learn how to 
ride Western style, as well as how to herd on a range. They also receive adventure training and bush craft skills.
The horses help them to increase their mobility as well as providing a therapeutic benefit.

The founders of Horseback UK,  Jock and Emma Hutchison, said their courses gave soldiers re-found confidence and a more positive outlook on their futures.

They started the charity three years ago and their team includes some ex-military volunteers. They use American Quarter hoses, which are known for their calm temperaments.

Mr Hutchison said the courses gave people time to consider what they wanted to do next.

A recent attendee was Pte 
Scott Meenagh, of the Parachute Regiment, who lost both legs after 
stepping on an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan in 2011.

The 23-year-old's friend and colleague
was killed trying to reach him, but despite the tragedy Mr Meenagh has 
taken up several sports including ice hocked and sailing to raise money for veterans.

Testimonials on the website revealed that working with horses had helped many come to terms with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Another course attendee said: 'I have learnt that I am stubborn but determined and still able to 
learn. I can laugh again and know what fun is. I thank you so much for
this chance as I now realise I am not on the scrap heap and have a 
chance at life again.'
