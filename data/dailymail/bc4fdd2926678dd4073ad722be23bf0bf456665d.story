Michael Phelps swam the last solo race of his Olympic career with yet another win, as the U.S. picked up three gold medals in 13 stunning minutes at the London Aquatic Centre.

The world's most decorated athlete touched the wall first in the men's 100m butterfly.

And in the minutes on either side of Phelps' grand exit, two teenage compatriots etched their names in Olympic history with incredible victories.

About five minutes before Phelps jumped off the starting block, Missy Franklin not only won a gold medal, but the 17-year-old shattered a world record in the 200m backstroke.

Several minutes after Phelps's win, Katie Ledecky, at just 15, dominated in the 800m freestyle, nearly setting a new world record herself.

Phelps has won an astonishing three 
golds and two silvers in five races in London. Franklin also has three 
golds and a bronze. They are the only triple-medallists of the 2012 
games.

Franklin clocked in at 2 minutes, 4.06 seconds, 0.75 quicker than the mark set by 
Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe at the 2009 world championships in Rome in a
 now-banned bodysuit.

It was the seventh world record of the games.

Add to that the success of Ledecky, who won the 800-meter freestyle by a full two seconds.

The youngest member of the U.S. swim team narrowly missed a world record in the blistering race, falling off pace on the last lap and finishing in 8 minutes, 14.63 seconds.

Mireia Belmonte Garcia of Spain touched in 8:18.76 to take the silver medal and defending champion Rebecca Adlington of Great Britain finished in 8:20.32 for bronze.

Adlington set the world record of 8:14.10 at the 2008 Beijing Games.

Despite her amazing feats, Franklin has refused to accept cash prizes or sponsorship deals.

Instead she is holding on to her amateur status so she can swim for a college team - when she is old enough.

And her aggressive performances in the water could not be further from her gentle demeanor when she climbs out, reverting back to the modest school girl who looks almost surprised to be there.

'I dreamed about this moment my whole life,' Franklin gushed after winning the gold medal in the women's 100-metre backstroke – her first - on Monday. 'I finally got one after 17 years!'

A As her parents are Canadian, they offered their daughter the option to swim for Canada, but their daughter refused, pointing out the support she has had from her hometown and high school.

Franklin manages to squeeze hours of training around her schoolwork, exam prep and social life at Regis Jesuit High School in Aurora, Colorado, but admitted in a recent interview that it's not always easy.

'Swimming - there's so much energy you 
have to put into it and I want to go to practice and work hard, so 
there's days when I can't stay out late, I can't go out with my 
friends,' she said.

True grit: Phelps and Lochte show off their new Olympic accessories poolside after their 'duel in the pool' on Thursday

But the story of the day is most likely Phelps, who completed his last individual swimming event with 21 gold medals - 17 of them gold.

Phelps's final race will take place tomorrow night in the 4x100 medley relay.

In the last clash of the swimming 
titans in London yesterday, Phelps showed why he's the greatest Olympian
 of all time in his final race 
against friend and rival Ryan Lochte.

The 27-year-old Phelps picked up gold
 in the 200m individual medley, as Lochte
came in right behind him.

The Olympic swimming sensation has made no secret about the fact that he plans to retire after the London games.

One more win: Michael Phelps won yet another gold medal in his last solo race, the 100-meter butterfly

Rumours have swirled that Phelps may be heading to a career in television after the London games.

Though
 Phelps hasn't divulged post-retirement plans, America's top TV networks
 are reportedly falling over themselves hoping to land Teams USA's 
golden boy as a sports commentator.

TMZ reported
 that NBC, ESPN and ABC are preparing to capture Phelps as a future 
Olympics commentator with huge contracts that could be worth millions - 
in a possible bidding war.

Michael Phelps has been swimming since he was seven years old, and while he has 
been subjected to more than a decade of training, his body is 
tailor-made for swimming.

His
 6'7" wingspan is longer than his 6'4" height, giving him a reach 
advantage. He also has an unusually long torso and extremely flexible 
ankles.

Tack on his size 14 feet, and there is a practically unbeatable swimmer.

Though he made the finals in the 200m butterfly in the 2000 Sydney games, Phelps - at just 15 years old - could not place higher than fifth.

It would be another four years before he could make a splash.

At the Athens games in 2004, he picked up six gold medals and two bronze at 19.

But
 it was in Beijing in 2008 when Phelps captivated the nation and 
rocketed to worldwide fame when he grabbed eight gold medals in all 
eight races.

In fact, Phelps' performance at the Beijing games was so impressive that many tried to persuade him to retire.

But rather than leave competition on a high note, Phelps said he would swim in London.

There
 were bumps along the way, most notably the notorious bong photo that 
appeared in the pages of the now-defunct News of the World in early 
2009.

Phelps eventually admitted 
'regrettable' behaviour and 'bad judgment' after the image, which showed
 him inhaling from a marijuana pipe, surfaced.

In
a statement released by one of his agents amid the scandal, Phelps 
said: 'I engaged in behaviour which was regrettable and demonstrated bad
 judgment.

The statement 
went on: 'I'm 23 years old and despite the successes I've had in the 
pool, I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a manner 
people have come to expect from me. For this, I am sorry. I promise my 
fans and the public it will not happen again.'

Phelps is believed to rake in more than $40million a year in
endorsements with brands like Speedo, Subway and Nike.

The New York Post reported that the swimmer is currently single, having broken up with his former
Miss California USA girlfriend Nicole Johnson in January.

At the height of his fame, Phelps also started the Michael Phelps 
Foundation, which is dedicated to promoting healthy lives and an active 
lifestyle among children through swimming.
