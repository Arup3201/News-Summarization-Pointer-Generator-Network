Susanna Reid's move to ITV appears to have gone from bad to worse after the audience for Good Morning Britain slumped to just 328,700, with viewers continuing to tune in to rival BBC Breakfast.

The programme drew about a quarter of the viewers that Reid's former show attracted yesterday morning, with 1.06million tuning in for the BBC's Bank Holiday Monday breakfast broadcast.

The result signals something of a ratings disaster for Good Morning Britain - which only launched last week - as the ITV show attracting just 11.9 per cent of the UK audience share, compared to BBC Breakfast's 31.5 per cent.

While all channels suffered a slight Bank Holiday Monday blip, the slump hit Good Morning Britain far worse than it did the BBC, according to official BARB audience figures.

During Good Morning Britain's launch week, the ITV show had an average of about 690,000 viewers, while BBC Breakfast maintained a steady 1.5million.

During the launch show, Good Morning Britain had a disappointing 800,000 viewers, but that fell to 735,000 on Tuesday, 636,000 on Wednesday, 671,000 on Thursday and just 611,000 on Friday.

The fall was reflected in a declining 
audience share for ITV, peaking at 18 per cent on Monday - compared to 
the BBC's 35 per cent - and falling to 15.7 per cent on Friday.

BBC
 Breakfast's enduring popularity was compounded by an additional 200,000
 viewers tuning in for the last half hour at 8.30 - when Good Morning 
Britain ended.

Not a good start: ITV chiefs will no doubt be concerned as the high profile launch of Good Morning Britain came after its predecessor, Daybreak, was dropped for low audience ratings

ITV chiefs will no doubt be concerned as the high profile launch of Good Morning Britain came after its predecessor Daybreak was dropped for low audience figures.

Daybreak was attracting an average of around 600,000 viewers in the months before it was axed.

Reid was Good Morning Britain's big signing to launch the new show after being lured from the BBC, where she had proved to be a popular figure.

Her profile increased hugely late last year in the wake of her appearances on last year’s Strictly Come Dancing.

Reid has been joined on the weekday ITV 
show by Ben Shephard - a familiar face for ITV breakfast viewers from 
his GMTV days, and Charlotte Hawkins and Sean Fletcher - who were both 
poached from Sky.

Twitter storm: Many people took to social media sites to voice their discontent about Good Morning Britain looking similar to Good Morning America

For viewers, one of the biggest changes to predecessor Daybreak - along with the presenting team - was the introduction of a glass desk at which the hosts were seated for much of the show, although they moved to sofas later in the show.

Many observers have interpreted the discussions around the desk as more of a US-style approach, taking its cue from ABC’s popular Good Morning America.

Viewers were divided on the show, with some lamenting the passing of its predecessor while others praised its fast pace and gloss.

Ms Reid’s ITV debut initially drew mixed 
reactions, with criticism that the show looked too similar to its U.S 
counterpart and that Ms Reid’s figure was obscured by a desk.

The big reveal: Several launch show viewers complained on Twitter about Susanna Reid hiding her figure behind a desk. Later in the programme she moved to an armchair

As the show began viewers took to Twitter to complain that the legs of the 43-year-old - whose pay for the role has been reported as £400,000 and as much as £1million a year - were hidden from view.

One viewer commented: 'Why has ITV paid so much for @susannareid100 only to put her behind a desk? Its like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the garage #gmb.'

Another wrote: 'You don't hire Susanna Reid and then stick her behind a desk #getyourpinsout #GoodMorningBritain.'
