The Reverend Paul Peverell’s flock happily contribute to collections during Sunday services.

Yesterday, however, he turned the tables.

Rev Pev, as he is affectionately known by his congregation, handed a £10 note from the church coffers to each parishioner who attended his Harvest Festival services.

Pays to pray: Reverend Paul Peverell gave £10 to every member of his congregation who attended a harvest festival service at Christ Church in Great Ayton, North Yorkshire

In return, the recipients were expected to use their windfall imaginatively towards acts of goodwill in the local community.

His idea could be said to have 
biblical origins. Some likened it to the Parable of the Talents, in 
which a man shares out his wealth among three servants in a test of how 
well they can use it in the service of God.

Rev Peverell, vicar of  Christ Church 
in Great Ayton, North Yorkshire, said: ‘It might be that they use that 
£10 to buy ingredients to bake, then drop their efforts off where they 
would be appreciated.

Queuing up: Reverend Peverell said he wanted to keep the feel-good factor of the Olympics and Jubilee going and encourage acts of goodwill in the local community

Take note: The Rev Peverell instructed his parishioners to spend the money on someone in need

‘Or they might take someone who is lonely for a coffee or to the cinema. I have given them lots of ideas.’

He expected to give out £1,500 in total but was keeping some money in reserve in case turn-out exceeded expectations.

He said: ‘We have had a very positive
reaction from the congregation. No strangers turned up. I think they 
thought they would have stood out like a sore thumb.

A few people have refused to take the 
money but said they will instead use their own to take part. It  seems 
the wrong way round, as usually members of the congregation give to the 
church.’

The vicar said he felt the initiative
might help sustain the feelgood factor left over by the Olympics and 
Jubilee celebrations.

He said the church often gave money 
to big charities but this was a way of  helping the immediate community.
Rev Peverell said that he had faith that most of the money would be 
passed on.

He added: ‘There’s obviously a chance someone won’t  pass it on. But for the ones that do, it will be worth it.’
