Hatem Ben Arfa has been ‘humiliated’ by Newcastle United, according to his agent.

The French forward has been made to train with the reserves this summer and did not join Alan Pardew’s squad on this month’s tour of New Zealand.

Ben Arfa fell out with the United management team towards the end of last season and is not part of their plans entering the new campaign.

He was fined on his return to training last month for allegedly being 1.5kg overweight, although he will appeal against that sanction.

Ben Arfa has one year to run on his current deal and, while he would prefer a return to France with Lyon, he could also run down the remainder of his contract in the reserves.

The 27-year-old’s representative, Michel Ouazine, said: ‘We don’t know what the problem is. Pardew in the past has said Hatem was extraordinary.

‘Hatem has done everything for Newcastle, every effort has been made to discuss the problem. We are in a situation where there doesn’t seem to be a solution.

‘He is simply doing his job: he trains well, he enjoys training with the reserves where he has a great coach in Peter Beardsley.’

He went on: ‘It’s unfair and humiliating. We will challenge the fine. We asked Newcastle to give us the player’s physical records.

‘Hatem went on vacation with a personal trainer, he has worked to prepare for this season. That 1.5 kg? Yes, it is a pound of muscle and 500 grams of fat.

‘He lost 2 per cent body fat. We therefore challenge the fine.’

Ben Arfa could even play a waiting game and Ouazine says Pardew could well be gone before his player.

‘Hatem doesn’t have to leave,’ he told SoFoot.com.

‘He can go on a free after his contract is over – six months, or a year, this is not a problem. Who knows how long Pardew will be at Newcastle. In two months, he may not be here. Hatem love this club, he is idolised by fans.

‘Hatem will remain professional and is working hard. He prefers a return to Lyon, but it is not economically feasible. Lyon is his first club, so there is a level of attachment. He loves Bernard Lacombe.

‘However, for me, it is very difficult financially – Newcastle want a lot of money for Hatem.’
