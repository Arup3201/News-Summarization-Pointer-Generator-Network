American cable networks Showtime and HBO are preparing to charge a record $99.95 (£65) for a pay-per-view subscription to watch the richest fight in history between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. 

A bidding war is under way for TV rights in at least 200 countries outside the US, the UK included with Sky, BT, BoxNation and perhaps ITV in contention for the bout, which is due to take place in Las Vegas on May 2.

With the combined purse for Mayweather and Pacquiao totalling at least $250million, projections for the value of the event are rising from an initial $300m to close on half a billion. 

Floyd Mayweather has  confirmed he will face Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2

If that comes to pass – and there are 10 weeks of promotional hype and hysteria to come - the rewards for the combatants will increase.

Come May 2, all the MGM properties will screen closed-circuit transmission on giants screens with entrance fees reaching $200 (£130) plus.

Millions in the Philippines will also watch on giant screens in city squares and parks. 

This was an offer that Mr Moneybags could not refuse. Not that the world would let him.

The MGM sold out all its 5,005 rooms within 15 minutes of Mayweather firing the starting gun online. The base room rate for the nights of May 1 and 2 is upward of $500.

Accommodation is already hard find all over the Strip.

Tickets for ringside seats, expected face value $5,000 (£3,300), are already appearing on the black market at up to $20,000 (£13,000).

The fight has been years in the making and, after the hype was ramped up when the boxers were pictured together at a basketball game in Miami last month, Maywetaher finally delivered the news last week via shots.com.
