USA goalkeeper Tim Howard was the busiest goalkeeper in World Cup history on Tuesday night as Belgium hammered at his goal but there was no way the stopper was going to be beaten.

The American was forced to make 16 saves - the most in a World Cup game since records began in 1966 -Â  and was in inspired form. Nothing was going to get past him as the stopper produced one of the greatest American goalkeeping displays in World Cup history.

Single-handedly forcing the tie into extra-time, whatever Belgium threw at him, the 35-year-old was up to the task; save after save after save.

Brick wall: Howard's shot-stopping capabilities and command of his area forced the game into extra-time

With the attacking talents of Eden Hazard, Divock Origi, Dries Mertens all peppering his goal Howard was in the form of his life and showed his prowess between the sticks.

On the hour mark, Howard's shutout became intriguing as his Everton team-mate Kevin Mirallas was introduced for the Red Devils. Would the Toffee frontman's know-how of how the Blues stopper operates see Belgium take lead? No chance.

Mirallas found himself clean through on goal minutes after coming on but was denied by the left boot of Howard as the keeper stayed big, stopping everything that was thrown at him.

Commanding his goal with authority, Howard was often left with little help from the back-line employed to protect him and had to bellow at his team-mates on more than one occasion.

Unfortunately USA's one-man show couldn't
 go on forever and Belgium finally broke the deadlock as former Chelsea 
man Kevin De Bruyne turned cleverly to create space for himself in the 
box and struck the ball past Howard and into the far corner of
 the net.

After acting like a brick wall for the 
entire opening ninety minutes, Howard was helpless to stop Belgium from 
doubling their advantage as Romelu Lukaku, who played with the keeper at Goodison Park last term, powerfully curled the ball inside the post.

Following 
the match, the performance of America's No 1 - perhaps one of the best 
goalkeeping displays in recent World Cup history - had clearly impressed
 Belgium captain Vincent Kompany who tweeted: 'Two words: TIM HOWARD. Respect.'

Meanwhile, USA manager Jurgen Klinmann paid tribute to Howard and said: 'What Tim played tonight was just phenomenal, outstanding - he kept us in that game for a long time. We are proud to have him with us.

'It was an absolutely amazing match tonight and you can give him the biggest compliment in the world.'

After some sterling saves and one of the performances of his career, it's a shame Howard had to be on the losing side as his World Cup dream came to an end.

At the age of 35, Howard may have one last summer tournament in him - and who could deny him that chance having performed so courageously for the Stars and Stripes.

Now though, after
 a well-deserved break, Howard's focus will return to club action with Everton 
and Toffees supporters will hope their main man 
between the sticks can take his World Cup form long into the new Premier
 League campaign.
