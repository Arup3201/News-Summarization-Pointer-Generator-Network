Liverpool want to cut short Divock Origi’s loan at Lille and have recalled highly-rated winger Jordon Ibe from Derby.

Manager Brendan Rodgers is determined not to rush England striker Daniel Sturridge back from injury and is trying to boost his attacking options.

Rodgers insisted that Mario Balotelli will not be sold in this transfer window just six months after a £16million move from AC Milan.

Divock Origi could be on his way to Anfield this month following his season-long loan spell with Lille

And Liverpool later confirmed that they had activated a break clause in Ibe’s season-long loan at Derby to bring the teenager back to Anfield for the second half of the campaign.

They are also in talks with Lille to negotiate an early return for Origi, who was loaned back to the French club for this season under the terms of his £10million transfer last summer.

Lille are demanding an extra £5m to release the Belgium World Cup star and have lined up Ajax striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson as a £4m replacement. Origi, 19, has struggled at Lille, where he has been booed by supporters after failing to score for the last 14 games.

‘He will certainly be here next summer,’ said Rodgers. ‘Whether he’ll be here in January, there have been discussions. The agreement is with Lille for him to stay there, so we’ll see how that works.

‘If not we’ll work with what we’ve got.’ 

Balotelli posted a video on his Instagram account of himself and Desmond N'Ze (above)

Asked about Balotelli, who is yet to score for Liverpool in the Premier League, he added: ‘He certainly won’t be going anywhere in January. Mario hasn’t scored the goals that he or we would have wanted, but we’re determined to help him find the solution here.’

Rodgers is wary of putting too much pressure on Sturridge, who has not played for Liverpool since August due to thigh and calf injuries.

The 25-year-old has broken down twice while attempting to come back from injury, and spent Christmas with the Boston Red Sox medical staff trying to get to the root of his persistent thigh problems.

‘He’s been out so long there’s no point putting a timeline on it when we don’t know exactly what that is,’ said Rodgers.

‘He’s into the final stages of his rehab and hopefully over the next few weeks he will improve on that.

‘People do have to be more realistic. First he has to get fit, generally. There’s match fitness and football fitness, so it will take a wee bit of time.

‘Just having him on the field to begin with will be critical to the team because his threat is obvious. It’s the only way we will get him back up to speed.

‘We have called in experts from different parts of the world, so we’re hoping it will allow him to stay fit for longer and a more consistent period.’

Rodgers also told Inter Milan that they would be wasting their time following up interest in Lucas Leiva with a formal offer this month.

‘It’s not something I would be willing to do in January,’ he said. ‘Of course, at the end of the season everything is looked at again but the team is in a good momentum.’

Meanwhile, Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre has insisted that the prospect of reduced playing time and not contract issues was behind Steven Gerrard’s decision to reject a new deal. The Liverpool captain is leaving for LA Galaxy at the end of the season.

Ayre claimed that the club made Gerrard a ‘substantial’ offer, adding: ‘The fact that he would have signed a contract last season actually doesn’t make any difference.

‘His point was that after playing every week, playing a bit-part role is not how he wanted to finish his career.’
