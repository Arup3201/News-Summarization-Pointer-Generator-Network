A 17-year-old skater has died after accidentally stumbling onto train tracks into the path of a train, police said.

Tyler Bailey was 'partying' with four friends when he was struck near the Dundas Street underpass in Toronto, Canada about 7pm Monday.

The teen's grief-stricken mother said she'd spoken to her son only moments before the tragedy.

'The last thing he said to me was, ‘Bye, mom, I love you’,' Shelley Bailey told Toronto Sun. 'That’s how we ended all our conversations. I’m just totally devastated, this doesn’t feel real.'

Tragic: Skater Tyler Bailey, 17, was 'partying' with four friends by the train tracks when he was fatally struck by a train in Toronto on Monday night

The mother-of-three described her son as bright and happy: 'Ever since he was little, everybody that met him loved him so much.'

Tyler's 20-year-old sister, Chantelle, said: 'My little brother was an amazing child and he did nothing but make people smile and laugh and make smiley faces.'

Police, who described Tyler's death as 'avoidable', said he'd walked close to the tracks.

His friends, seeing the approaching train, called for him to get out of the way, but he tripped onto the tracks and was hit.

'There was just no time for anyone to react,' Detective-Constable Stu Parsons, of the Traffic Services Division, said.

A witness told the Toronto Sun she heard teenaged boys 'having a good time' on the tracks before the accident.

'They were being very loud and partying,' the woman, who asked not to be identified, said. 'I was actually quite scared for them because I knew rush hour traffic was coming.'

CBC News reported the GO Transit train left Union Station 6.50pm, about 10 minutes before Tyler's body was found.

Tyler's friends remember him as an 'outgoing' person who loved to ride his scooter.

He was a regular at CJ Skateboard Park and School, a skate park in Etobicoke.

'The kids loved him. He just - I don't know how to describe it,' friend Michael Punkris told Hamilton Spectator.

'(Riding scooters) was his main passion. He just fell in love with it, trying tricks.'
