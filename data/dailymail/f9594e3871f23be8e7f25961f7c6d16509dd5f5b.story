Top New York television meteorologist Bill Evans who has been arrested for allegedly assaulting his estranged wife claims it was she who attacked him and scratched his private parts during a violent dispute about moving cars.

Bill Evans and his soon-to-be former spouse of 19 years, Dana Evans, offered radically different accounts of the domestic incident that took place inside their Connecticut home last month.

According to an affidavit by the responding police officer, Evans' wife grabbed the waist band of his underwear and reached for his scrotum with her free hand, subsequently scratching it (his scrotum), which resulted in bleeding.'

The 52-year-old WABC meteorologist claimed that the fight started on May 14 when Dana Evans humiliated him in front of the couple's children, telling him that he does not live with them and they he is not wanted in their home.

Mr Evans' daughter then asked him to move the car, and he replied that he would do it after he changed, according to the affidavit by Greenwich police officer Kristin Lindstrom that was cited by The New York Post.

The domestic dispute escalated when Dana Evans, 48, stormed into the room, emptied her husband’s work bag onto the bed and grabbed the car keys, the document states.

When Mr Evans asked for his keys back,
'Dana then punched him with her right hand on the left side of his face
while holding the keys and then slapped him,' the WABC weatherman told 
police.

According to the 
52-year-old man, his wife attempted to 'karate kick' him, but slipped on
the hardwood floor. Undeterred, the woman allegedly reached into his 
underwear and scratched his testicles, drawing blood.

Mr
Evans said he pushed his spouse away, but she attacked him with a 
wooden clothes hanger, striking him in the back and buttocks.

Dana Evans, however, has offered a wildly different version of events.

Mrs
Evans said she wanted to move cars outside their driveway so they would
be able to leave on time the next day, and asked her husband for the 
keys - but he refused, an affidavit for her version of events showed.

When
she reached for the keys, her husband grabbed her by the hand and she 
attempted to throw the keys out of the door - but they landed in a 
closet and they both scuffled for them, she said.

According to the wife, Bill Evans 
shoved her, so she attempted to kick him away, but the weatherman 
grabbed her leg, causing her to fall.

Dana Evans said her spouse punched 
her in the right eye with a closed fist, and she defended herself by 
striking him with a clothes hanger.

Dana Evans, who has also been arrested, sought counseling at a domestic-violence center after the fight on May 14 at their home in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Evans, 52, who works for television station WABC-TV, and Dana, 48, both surrendered to Greenwich police last week and were released after promising to appear in court.

They have been charged third-degree assault and disorderly conduct charges. Both were ordered by a judge to keep away from one another.

'Bill and Dana are presently going through a difficult divorce,' Evan's lawyer, Philip Russell, said in a statement.

The New York Post reported that court papers showed the row was sparked by moving parked cars.

But Bill Evans said it was their daughter who had asked him to move the cars, and he agreed to dress and help her.

But his wife 'began to insult him in 
front of their children and told him he does not live there nor is he 
wanted there,' his version reads.

She then went to the room and grabbed
his keys, and when he asked for them back, she punched him on the face 
and then slapped him, he said.

Russell added
that more than two weeks after the argument, Mrs Evans was advised by 
her divorce attorneys to file the complaint, and a police investigation 
was launched.

'After seeking counseling at a 
local domestic violence center, Dana reported the incident to the 
Greenwich police,' Dana Evans' lawyer Mark Sherman said in a statement.

'Obviously, divorces can get emotional, 
and we expect Dana to be cleared of these charges in due time. The 
safety, privacy and welfare of her family continue to be her primary 
concern.'

Connecticut law requires that all reports of domestic arguments are reported to the Superior Court.

But the weatherman's lawyer said in a statement: 'We expect that Bill will be exonerated and this case will be quickly forgotten.'

Evans, who grew up in Mississippi, has worked for WABC since 1989 and is a published author. The couple has four children together.
