'Horrendous record': David Archer, 57, has committed over 300 offences and is thought to have spent 28 years in prison

One of the country's most prolific petty crooks - who claims to have spent almost half his life in prison - is back behind bars and facing his 16th Christmas in jail.

David Archer, 57, already has more than 300 offences on his 'horrendous record', a court heard, mostly for theft.

Yesterday a judge sentenced Archer to a further three months in prison for breaching an Anti-Social Behaviour Order after he threatened a female Police Community Support Officer.

Archer, of Rhyl, North Wales, who has stolen charity collection boxes in the past, hurled abuse at the PCSO when she tried to speak to him about selling alcohol in the street at Llandudno Junction, Caernarfon Crown Court heard.

When she approached him the thief retorted: 'Why don't you get a proper job? I've spent 28 years inside, do you know what I'd like to do to you - slit your throat.'

Last summer the same court was told Archer had committed 333 offences during his life of crime, and had breached his ASBO nine times.

He was handed an indefinite ASBO in 2006.

Judge Peter Heywood said Archer had a 'horrendous record', but expressed hope at yesterday's hearing that the career crook could yet turn his life around.

'It seems there is some window of hope for you,' the judge said.

'I've seen a letter from your brother who seems to be bending over backwards to give you teh chance of a job in the Leeds area.'

When defence barrister Andrew 
McInnes had mentioned the support on offer for Archer in Leeds, Judge 
Heywood remarked: 'That may give some respite to North Wales 
police.'

Archer had already spent the equivalent of two months in prison on remand, which will count towards his three month sentence. He is expected to be released later this month, but it was not clear whether he will be a free man before Christmas Day.
