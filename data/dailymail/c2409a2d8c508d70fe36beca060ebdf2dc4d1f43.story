A teacher at a California high school arrested over the weekend for having sex with her students may have more victims.

Amy Corinne Bramlett, 46, was arrested at her home on the 3,400 block of Parkside Drive on suspicion of sex with two boys aged 16 and 17.

She was also arrested on suspicion of oral copulation of a child under age 18 and penetration with a foreign object.

Arrested: Bramlett is being held on $1 million 

According to the Press Enterprise, she was booked into Central Detention Center and bail was set at $1 million.

The alleged incidents occurred between January and June of this year.

A news release said the encounters took place between January and June in the 7200 block of Sunrise Court in Highland. Records show Bramlett lives on Sunrise.

Bramlett was a program specialist at Indian Springs High School when the inappropriate relationships occurred.

The 17-year-old was a former student at the school, the 16-year-old was not.

Now, detectives say there may be more victims.

Bramlett's next court appearance is scheduled for September 16.

'The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s requested the assistance of the district police department regarding an investigation into allegations that an Indian Springs High School teacher engaged in inappropriate behavior with a current student and a former student,' district spokeswoman Maria Garcia wrote in an email to the San Bernadino Sun Monday morning.

'Indian Springs High School administrators learned of the allegations on Friday, Sept. 12 when they were informed of an impending arrest.'
