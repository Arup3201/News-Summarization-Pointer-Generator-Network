Four years ago bodybuilder Justin House was lifting weights in the gym when he felt what he describes as a bang in his lower back.

He was rushed to hospital where doctors discovered a massive cell tumour had been growing inside one of his 
vertebrae. The bang he felt was his spine bursting under the pressure.

It took three surgeons 14 hours to remove the cancer during which time Justin, 41, from south London, was given seven litres of blood.

The ex-Calvin Klein model was lifting weights in the gym when he felt a 'bang' in his back. Doctors discovered he had a huge tumour which had burst out of a vertebra in his spine

But the ordeal didn't end there. Justin was prescribed opiate painkillers and after a year of taking them he had become addicted.

In
an attempt to wean himself off, he switched to over-the-counter 
paracetamol and ibuprofen that eventually destroyed both his kidneys.

But now
Justin has been given a second chance thanks to pioneering 
surgery, one of the most expensive drugs in the world, and a new kidney 
donated by his older brother, Gavin.

Earlier this week, surgeons
at Guy’s Hospital in London performed the kidney transplant and Justin is said to be doing well.

But doctors will be keeping a close eye, as Justin has a high chance of rejecting
the kidney thanks to a particular type of antibody – usually found in 
pregnant women – which he has picked up after having multiple blood 
transfusions.

To combat
this he has been given 108 hours of treatment over the last 12 days 
pumping his blood through a machine designed to filter out the antibody 
and give him a better chance of success.

And to ensure the kidney is accepted, he is being used as a guinea pig for an 
experimental American drug called Eculizumab, designed to suppress his 
immune system.

Justin, who is only the fifth person in the UK to be given the drug, had his first injection this week which cost £24,000.

Depending how many he needs, the treatment could spiral to more than £200,000.

Mr House had to have a 14-hour operation to remove the tumour and then spent 104 days in hospital recovering during which time he developed an infection in his leg and two collapsed lungs

He was given opiate painkillers but after a year he started to become dependent on them so had to wean himself off them and start taking over-the-counter medications instead

He
said: ‘This is a case of third time lucky. The operation has been 
postponed twice before due to health complications and my surgeon has 
warned me that it could still be put off at the last minute if the 
blood-work doesn’t look good, but I’ve got to stay positive.

‘My
brother has never had so much as a broken bone so the first time he 
goes into hospital will be to have an organ removed and given to his kid
brother.

Over-the-counter painkillers caused Mr House's kidneys to fail meaning that he was dependent upon dialysis and needed a kidney transplant

‘It’s a big thing he’s doing for me but he’s doing it because he knows I’d do the same for him.

‘It’s scary stuff but with this special kind of surgery, and with the drug, Guy’s have had a 100 per cent success rate so far.’

Following the tumour surgery in 2009, Justin spent 104 days in hospital having metalwork fitted in place of the shattered bone and he lost all feeling from the waist down.

He also suffered two collapsed lungs and pneumonia.

Doctors were even forced to carry out an unusual procedure in which one of his lungs was stitched to his ribcage to stop it from collapsing again.

Speaking about the traumatic 
experience, the former Fitness First personal trainer said: ‘The last 
few years have been really tough. I do talk to myself most of the day, 
in the car and when I’m walking around.

‘It’s
a good cop bad cop scenario playing out.

'Once voice telling me none of 
it will work and I’ll be on dialysis forever, and the other telling me 
that everything will be fine and I can still have a normal life.

‘I sob every day. Not just a little sob, but real genuine crying.

‘I have insomnia so I don’t sleep much, and even when I do I get vivid nightmares and wake up screaming.'

‘If it wasn’t for my loving family and my wonderful girlfriend, I wouldn’t have made it this far.’

Even
though Justin has to go for dialysis three times a week, goes to the 
gym, and still sees clients from his personal training business, he does
manage to find time for himself.

‘I love to go to the movies on my own during the middle of the day and watch anything - action, romcom, thriller, whatever.

‘The
people at the box office must think I’m some sort of saddo going there 
on my own, but I sit there by myself in the empty theatre and for two 
and a half hours I’m gone. I don’t have to think about any of it.’

Mr House (right) has been given a new kidney by his older brother, Gavin (left). To stop his body rejecting the kidney he may have to take extremely expensive immune suppressing drugs

If the operation is a success, Justin
will still have to spend another nine months going back for check-ups, 
blood tests, and biopsies on his new organ to make sure he is no longer 
at risk.

Even though 
there is every chance the surgery could fail or be postponed again, 
Justin is now starting to look forward to a better quality of life.

He said: 'As soon as I’m done and 
they’ve given me the ok to fly, me and my girlfriend Lou have some 
friends in America we’d love to go and visit. We’d also like to expand 
our business and open up a gym maybe.

'If
there’s one thing this experience has taught me is to live without 
hesitation. A lot of the time you hear people talking about doing things
one day, but never getting around to it. I’m determined not to do that.

'I
was materialistic and got up tight about things that didn’t matter. But
I have learnt now that the things that really matter are your health 
and your family.'

Justin House, 41, a former bodybuilder, needed a kidney transplant because he developed kidney failure after having a tumour removed from his back

The drug - Eculizumab - costs £244,000 per patient, per year. It is one of the most expensive drugs in the world and Mr House would be only the fifth person in the UK to receive it

Mr House says that if the operation is successful he and his girlfriend, Louise Alford (pictured), will go and visit friends in the U.S.
