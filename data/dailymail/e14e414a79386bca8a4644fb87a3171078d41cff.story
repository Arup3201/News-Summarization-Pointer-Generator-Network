She's got one of the most envied bodies in showbiz but Millie Mackintosh has revealed that it takes a lot of hard work and dedication to look as good as her.   

The fitness enthusiast and TV star shared her health and fitness regime as she showed off her honed physique in a new Reebok shoot.

Speaking about how often she works out, the 25-year-old said: 'Anywhere between two and six times a week. Ideally I do four to five sessions but I don’t beat myself up if I have a really busy week and cannot stick to that. 

'If I have events or parties to go to, I try to balance it out with a healthy weekend and be flexible with it.'

Millie Mackintosh, who follows an extremely healthy lifestyle, has partnered with Reebok and shared her tips to getting a toned body like hers

Millie, who is a walking advert for the healthy lifestyle that she preaches, said she loves working out so much because it's like 'therapy for the brain'. 

She said: 'No matter how stressful your day is, you have to focus when it comes to your workout and you come out feeling refreshed. It wakes you up and I feel like it gives me loads of fresh thoughts. 

'It’s also the benefit of feeling fit and healthy, it’s not about weight loss for me, it’s about balance; I like to go out, I like to eat good food, so it’s about balancing off those naughty calories.'

Millie, who is a walking advert for the healthy lifestyle that she preaches, said she loves working out so much because it's like 'therapy for the brain' and says if it doesn't hurt, it's not working

Millie says she tries to do two weights-based sessions a week and loves trying different fitness classes

The fitness fanatic is even thinking about getting a pull-up bar installed in the house she shares with husband, Professor Green, to boost her athletic ability 

Millie said anyone who wants to follow her lead must make it part of their lifestyle and be consistent. 

'It’s quite addictive when you start to see the positive change in your body and whilst it takes time, you have to commit to it,' she maintains. 

The entrepreneur, who found fame on Made In Chelsea, explained that she tries to do two weights-based sessions a week and loves trying different fitness classes the rest of the time.

'I really like the high-intensity, high-energy workouts with no rest,' she said. 'You sweat, you feel sick, but it’s set to music, you’re in a group and it pushes you, so it's a lot of fun. 

'I tell myself that there’s no point showing up if I’m not going to push myself, it has got to hurt. If your workout is easy, it's not going to be doing anything for you and you’re not going to get the results.'

Millie is so enthused by working out that she's thinking about getting a pull-up bar installed in the house she shares with husband, Professor Green.

Millie, who is getting set to unveil the second drop from her new fashion range, said anyone who wants to follow her lead must make it part of their lifestyle and be consistent

The star, pictured at fashion week last month, said that working out isn't about weight loss, it's about balance. 'I like to go out, I like to eat good food, so it's about balancing off those naughty calories,' she said

Millie has partnered with Reebok to launch #BreakYourSelfie, a social campaign which aims to challenge the notion of what beauty is.

#BreakYourSelfie encourages fitness enthusiasts to rebel against the millions of shiny, happy selfies and instead post images to of themselves at their most depleted, raw, broken post-workout state. 

Speaking about the campaign as she showed off her natural beauty in the pictures, she said: 'Encouraging women to do a really hard workout and to be fit is a really positive message, especially as anyone can take part. 

'It’s not about looking pretty and whilst I do post selfies when I am made-up for shoots, with fitness, it’s a really healthy message and I want to see lots of broken selfies!'.
