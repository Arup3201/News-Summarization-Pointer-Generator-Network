A New Jersey couple have been found dead in their home.

Morris County Prosecutor Fredric Knapp said Jefferson Township Police were called to the home at 12 Log Road in Lake Hopatcong at around 1 a.m. Sunday morning on a report of two unconscious adults.

There, officers Tim Hecht and Dave Wroblewski discovered husband and wife, Julian Knott, 45, and Alita Knott, 47, deceased inside the property.

There was no evidence of outside intrusion into the home, Knapp said.

There is 'no cause for concern to the community,' he added.

Dead: Husband and wife, Julian Knott, 45, and Alita Knott, 47, pictured, were found dead in their New Jersey home

It's not clear how the couple died or whether it is being investigated as a murder suicide. No cause of death for the couple has been released.

The Star Ledger identified Alita Knott as a sales associate at Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in the Chester/Hackettstown Office.

Spokeswoman Aglaia Pikounis told the newspaper: 'We are terribly saddened by the 
news.' She refused to comment further citing the ongoing investigation into the deaths.

Mrs Knott's agent profile on the real estate website says she was born in the Philippines and worked as a teacher there for a few years.

She then moved to Bahrain and was able to travel extensively with her job.

'After 
meeting my husband while working in London, I married, had three 
children and started my own pre-school nursery business, which I still 
own,' she writes.

Her profile said her husband's work took them to Dublin, Ohio, and then more recently to New Jersey.

Neighbor Agnes Mysliwiec, 44, told the 
Star Ledger late on Sunday that she didn't know the couple personally, but they had 
moved to the street recently.

The family home was purchased in May for $600,000.

The two story, 4,250sqft home has 4 bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms.

Authorities did not reveal who first discovered the bodies and called police.

The couple have three children, though it's not known if any were home at the time of the deaths.

No further information is being released to the public at this time, Knapp said.

The Morris County Sheriff's Office CIS and Major Crime's Unit assisted at the scene.
