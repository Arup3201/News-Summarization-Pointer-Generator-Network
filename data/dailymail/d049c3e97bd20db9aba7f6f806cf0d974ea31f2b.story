An 18-year-old man was today charged with the rape of an 11-year-old girl who was on her way home from school, police said.

Opemipo Jaji was also charged with attempted rape following the attack on the schoolgirl in Enfield, north London, on Friday.

He will appear at Enfield Magistrates' Court today, Scotland Yard said.

Scene of the attack: A police car patrols outside Jubilee Park in Enfield, where an 11-year-old girl was subjected to a 'brutal' sexual assault on Friday evening

Jaji was arrested in Edmonton on Monday evening and police were yesterday given more time to quiz him.

Another man, 26, who was also held in connection with the attack has been released on bail until late December.

Police appealed for witnesses after the schoolgirl, who was wearing her uniform, was attacked in Jubilee Park, Enfield, on Friday afternoon.

The girl, who police described as petite, returned home at around 8pm and was taken to hospital where she needed surgery.

Detective Inspector Simon Ellershaw said it was 'a horrific and unusual attack of a defenceless schoolgirl'.

Violence: This section of the park was closed off as police searched for clues following the attack shortly after 4.15pm on Friday

The girl was raped as she walked home along a busy shortcut after getting off a bus on Friday afternoon.

She realised she was being followed and tried to zig-zag across the road, but the attacker grabbed her and pulled her into Jubilee Park, where the assault took place.

The victim told her distressed parents what had happened and they took her to hospital.

The park lies opposite a row of smart houses in the affluent north London suburb.

Up to 60 officers working on the investigation. Detective Inspector Simon Ellershaw, who is leading the investigation for the Sapphire Command, said: 'She says the attack happened for some considerable time - possibly in the region of two to three hours.'

Local residents spoke of their disbelief that such an attack had happened within yards of commuters walking home.
