Real Madrid:

Atletico Madrid: 

Host commentator

That rather meandered along in the second half but Diego Simeone will be delighted. Atletico - thanks to substitute Arda Turan's late goal - have recorded back-to-back victories at the Bernabeu for the first time in their history. 

Cristiano Ronaldo had levelled earlier from the spot after Tiago gave Atletico the lead, but Real never got a head of steam. Problems for Carlo Ancelotti going forward.

Into stoppage time... only two minutes!! 

Greizmann should've finished it! Did Pepe a kipper down the right but only fires int the sidenetting! Big, big chance. 

Suarez yellow card after bringing down Modric. Are we to get a quality ball in? 

Kroos... and Moya wanders out to collect. Deary me. 

Miranda has a yellow to his name now as Real Madrid push forward... free-kick on the edge of the box, right-hand side. James Rodriguez must step up and deliver.

Clipped in with no conviction. Awful. 

Booking for Modric now as the visitors stand over a decent set piece here. 

Wasted though. Five minutes to go. 

83mins: Ronaldo now shooting from anywhere. Desperate for Real Madrid, this, and Atletico will just throw bodies in front of those efforts.

If Atletico manage to hang on for the next ten minutes it'll be the first time ever they've won consecutive league matches at the Bernabeu. 

Real look to be lacking ideas here, worryingly for Carlo Ancelotti. 

Good area on the right. Needs a delivery... but Kroos' centre is palmed away by Moya. 

Well, I did say it suited Atletico and it's Arda Turan who's put the visitors back in front! A nice stepover by Raul Garcia inside the box and the substitute sweeps into the far corner. Wonderful, wonderful passed finish. 

Those 50 (yes, fifty) travelling fans are delirious. 

This has opened up somewhat, which suits Atletico on the counter you would've thought. And Arda Turan again! Juanfran's whipped cross isn't met by the substitute and Arbeloa heads over for a corner. 

Chance! Arda Turan cuts in from the left, opens his body up and just drives wide! 

72mins: Here comes Isco, replacing the largely ineffectual Gareth Bale. 

Into the final 20 minutes now and we've barely had a chance after the break. I won't lie, this has disappointed me since eight o'clock.

And how Hernandez picks up a yellow card. This is ridiculous! 

Seven for the night. 

Javier Hernandez, by the way, scored on his debut for his previous two clubs. 

Arbeloa in the book now! It's not been that kind of game really. 

Changes: Hernandez on for Benzema and Greizmann is on for Gimenez.  

Real panic stations with Ramos at the back who hacks for a needless corner. 

Godin gets above his marker - Pepe, incidentally - at the back post but nods over. 

Chance for Bale but his header floats into Moya's arms. Rodriguez's centre was too drifty and behind Bale. 

Meanwhile, Arda Turan is coming on for the booked Gabi. 

A little bit niggly here. Atletico trying to slow the game down, but they have a free-kick in an advantageous position. Ah, but it comes to nothing. They aren't potent enough, with Mandzukic not wining enough in the air. 

54mins: Booking for Gabi, who tactically hauls down Rodriguez as he rampaged on the counter. Clever. 

Bit of territory for Atletico now. Juanfran launches a throw-in towards the six-yard box but the hosts easily clear. 

51mins: And there's another from way out - this time from Pepe - that flies over. Tepid start. 

47mins: First shot in anger during this second half and it comes from James Rodriguez who blasts over from 30 yards. 

Right, here we go. Will Atletico come out more? They kick us back off and clear to touch. Ominous. 

The referee has blown slightly early there. Bit odd. Anyway, Tiago gave Atletico the lead with a superb near post header early doors before Ronaldo bought - then scored - a penalty to level it up. 

Real have been guilty of missing a number of opportunities and should be leading here. 

Atletico have - somewhat disappointingly - sat in and absorbed too much pressure here. Was expecting them to come out a little bit more. 

Mandzukic in the book for a late one in midfield as Real win a corner. Pepe tries to steer towards the back post but nothing comes of it, despite Ronaldo's best efforts. They're getting closer though... 

Benzema tries to make amends for that fluff before but slides an effort wide after nicely cutting inside on the edge. 

Can't have helped that half the Bernabeu were jeering him as he shaped to shoot. Madness. 

Horrible touch Benzema! Ronaldo streams forward on the left, plays in the Frenchman who has all the time in the word but he miscontrols and Moya is out to thwart him. Really poor, that. 

Well, I expected Real to flood forward after the goal but it's been a fairly subdued five minutes or so. 

Ronaldo doesn't miss many, and he sends Moya the wrong way to level it up. Cool as you like. 

Game on!

Ronaldo goes over the challenge of Siqueira and it's given! Could barely hear the whistle and it's barely a foul. Think Ronaldo has bought that. 

Godin hauls down Ronaldo on the edge and picks up a booking for his troubles. 

Good area this... Ronaldo over it. Surprise, surprise. 

Oh, no! It's Bale! And what a save by Moya, diving to his left to deny the Welshman. Vicious dip and swerve. 

Poor from Gabi, who gives away the ball in his own third, but Real cannot capitalise - largely because two or three defenders then harry to win back possession. 

Tame header is comfortably saved. The Bernabeu is a touch restless. 

James Rodriguez is in the book for protesting after not being awarded what appeared to be a clear free-kick on the edge. Harsh. 

Juanfran marauds down the right and earns a corner. Can Real defend? They struggle again but Benzema eventually hooks away. Very nervy at the back. 

Chance for James Rodriguez - teed up by Ronaldo - but he can't direct a tricky volley towards goal. The Colombian struck it into the ground and it bounces harmlessly over. 

You fancy that Real need a quick reply. 

14mins: Ronaldo looks a touch miffed at that early goal, drives at the away area, but flashes an effort over the top. 

Good from Siqueira down the left... corner... and GOAL! Thiago was ignored at the near post - Coentrao, Benzema and Ronaldo the guilty parties - and he nods home from a wicked Koke delivery. 

First bit of work for Casillas, who plucks a Koke cross out of the air confidently. Different goalkeeper this season! 

Atletico are superb at pressing high and forcing mistakes. We've seen that already as the visitors turn possession over in Real's third. 

This is not only one of the biggest clashes in Spain, but on the continent now. I was lucky enough to be in Lisbon for the Champions League final a few months ago and you don't realise how much this particular fixture means until you sample it first-hand. 

So here we go at the Bernabeu, Real get us underway... 

Well done all. 

Casillas; Arbeloa, Pepe, Ramos, Coentrao; Modric, Kroos, James; Bale, Cristiano, Benzema

Moya, Godín, Siqueira, Tiago, Koke, Raul Garcia, Mandzukic, R. Jimenez, Gabi, Juanfran, Miranda
