Pauline Chai told the High Court her vast shoe collection was proof the UK was her home 

The Malaysian wife of a retail tycoon fighting to have her divorce carried out in British courts cited her vast collection of designer shoes as proof that she lives in the UK. 

Former beauty queen Pauline Chai told the High Court that keeping more than 1,000 pairs of shoes in her sprawling Hertfordshire estate meant the country mansion was her permanent home. 

The 67-year-old and her husband Khoo Kay Peng, who is also from Malaysia, are embroiled in a sensationally expensive divorce battle, with their respective lawyers already racking up bills of £2million. 

Dr Peng, who is the billionaire chairman of Laura Ashley, was not in court to hear his estranged wife's  claims.D

The 75-year-old is trying to have the divorce ruled in Malaysia, where Ms Chai would likely receive a lesser settlement than in the UK. 

'I have got like 1,000 pairs of shoes,' Ms Chai told the court. 'All these were added up from 43 years. I accumulate them.' 

Dr Peng's lawyer presented photographs of her wardrobes in Kuala Lumpar, claiming she had just as much designer fashion elsewhere. 

But, Ms Chai, who was Miss Malaysia in 1969, said some of them were out of style and 'heavy'. 

She also revealed she had bought her estranged husband a padded toilet seat. 

'He will sit on the toilet for four hours and read and do his work... And he got backache there, so I got the idea of the padded toilet seat.'

The court heard how the couple, who have five children, settled at Rossway Park, near Berkhamsted, in 2009 after years of travelling, though Mr Peng does not consider it their home. 

They had lived there for four years when divorce proceedings were launched, with Ms Chai claiming she needed to get out of the 'abusive' marriage. 

She told Mr Justice Bodey: 'I just wanted to get away from an abusive, oppressive relationship which I could not take because of my age.

'When I was younger I could recover. Now it was too difficult to overcome it because of the violence and the fear he was putting on me.'

She added: 'For those reasons. None of the finances bothered me. I knew he had enough to go for the rest of our lives so that never occurred to me. 

'The reason I wanted freedom from him was because he was getting violent and I was very fearful.'  

Among the claims made in court yesterday were that her husband was investigated by a 'corruption agency' in Singapore 25 years ago. The claim was denied by Dr Khoo's lawyer.

Beauty queen: Ms Chai was named Miss Malaysia in 1969 and has since lived in Australia, Canada and the UK

She told Mr Justice Bodey the family had been living in Perth, Australia, at the time and they uprooted and moved to Canada.

Ms Chai did not give detail of the investigation - which she said took place in the late 1980s - but said two of her estranged husband's friends had been jailed.

'He was being investigated,' she said. 'There was a lot of panic. He was frightened.

'There was a lot of discussion about moving out of Perth to a country which has no extradition treaty with Singapore.' 

She added: 'A short while later the family just flew to Victoria (Canada) and we stayed there.

'I know he didn't leave Canada ... for a long time. He avoided Singapore for five years.'

Dr Khoo was not in court and has yet to give evidence - but a lawyer representing him told the court: 'I suggest that is completely false. Dr Khoo was not personally investigated.'

Ms Chai also said her family left Australia in the late 1980s after one of her children was 'beaten up' during an attack which had a 'racial undertone'.

She said she had took the children out of a Perth boarding school, where they had been placed after the family moved from Malaysia.

'I believe there was a white policy in Australia in the seventies and they had just got rid of that policy,' she told the judge. 'But in fact it still remained and there was this racial undertone.

'Because of that one of the boys was just beaten up by about ten other boys after being called racial names.

'We decided to take the children out of the boarding school.'

Battle: Despite consisting only of 'skirmishes' the battle at the High Court (pictured) has already cost £2m

Mr Justice Bodey is expected to rule at the end of the current round of hearings on where the case will be held.

Ms Chai said she would be at a 'huge disadvantage' if she had to fight in Malaysia. 

Richard Todd QC, for Ms Chai, said she lived on a 'beautiful English estate', had a taste for English TV shows and valued what was 'quintessentially' English.

He told Mr Justice Bodey that she was fulfilling a 'legitimate desire to be here'.    

At an earlier hearing Mr Justice Holman said Dr Khoo owned a 'chunk' of Laura Ashley and had properties in England and Malaysia worth more than £50million.

He said that, on any 'feasible' view, Ms Chai would get tens of millions of pounds for the part she had played in their 42-year 'matrimonial partnership'. 

The hearing continues.
