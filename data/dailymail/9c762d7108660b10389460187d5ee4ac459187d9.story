The manager of an Iowa fast food restaurant has lost her job after a customer posted pictures of the woman making food in the kitchen barefoot and sweating.

The Des Moines Register reports that 31-year-old Melinda Halvorsen was fired from the Taco John's restaurant in Charles City in August after Danielle Tiesmessen posted the picture to Facebook.

Tiesmessen says she was in Charles City Taco John's when she saw Halvorsen enter the food preparation area with no shoes, gloves or uniform.

Food prep nightmare: A customer took this photo of the manager of a Charles City Taco John's preparing food while barefoot and allegedly sweaty

'This is in Charles City Iowa Taco John’s!! This woman was preparing food with bare feet, no uniform, her bra and chest hanging out all over the place, she was pouring sweat, wiping it off with her hands and not washing them.

'I asked for the manager — she WAS the manager!! She was extremely rude because I was upset with her appearance and behavior,' Tiesmessen posted along with the picture.

According to the Des Moines Register, Halvorsen, a team leader who was employed at the restaurant for five years, had mowed the grass outside the franchise prior to entering the restaurant. She was apparently preparing food for herself and some friends when Tiesmessen spotted her.

After the franchise owner Linda Johnson reviewed security footage of the incident, Halvorsen was fired for her conduct, which violated company policy as well as state health regulations.

She also failed to pay for the food she prepared for herself and her friends.

Halvorsen recently lost her appeal to collect unemployment benefits because officials ruled she violated health codes and hurt the restaurant's business.

Taco John's is a fast food restaurant chain that serves Mexican inspired food (what the company has trademarked as 'West-Mex') in 25 states around the central and north central section of the United States.

Franchisee Johnson says business has declined more than 25 per cent since the August 8 incident and that her franchise agreement with Taco John's could be in jeopardy because of Halvorsen's conduct.

Tiesmessen's photo quickly went viral around the Midwest, garnering media attention and more than 1,000 negative comments about Taco John's.

The picture appears to have been removed from the Taco John's site where it was initially posted.
