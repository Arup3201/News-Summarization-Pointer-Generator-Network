A man has been spared jail after he hid a camera in his shopping basket to film up women's skirts in a supermarket, a court heard today.

Timothy Cordell, 56, smuggled the device inside a tablet box and propped it up using a bottle of milk, before prowling the aisles of a Sainsbury's store to get footage of unsuspecting women's underwear.

His scheme was uncovered when customers complained to staff about Cordell sidling up to them and the bizarre way he was holding his shopping basket.

Sneaky: Timothy Cordell hid a camera inside his shopping basket and used it to film up women's skirts at Sainsbury's in Taplow

The secret camera was discovered when Cordell was stopped and searched on December 19 last year.

Police later searched his house and found a USB stick which held 48 indecent images of children, Reading Crown Court heard.

A second memory stick contained 639 
images and a laptop had a further 675, with an additional three videos. 
All were of children aged between 13 and 16.

He admitted three counts of making indecent photographs of children and one count of committing an act outraging public decency.

The court heard he was a family man of previous good character who was 'humiliated' at being exposed.

'Gross invasion': Female customers complained to staff about Cordell sidling up to them at the supermarket

Judge Zoe Smith said the supermarket victims were probably unaware they had been filmed.

But she added: 'It was nevertheless a gross invasion into someone else’s privacy.'

Cordell, from Maidenhead, Berks, was given a three-year community order and must attend a sexual offenders’ group programme.

He was ordered to pay court costs of £500 and was placed on the sexual offenders' register for five years.

A five-year sexual offences prevention order means 'risk management software' will be installed on his computer.
