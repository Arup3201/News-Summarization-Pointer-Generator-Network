Sir James Munby who oversees the shadowy Court of Protection, indicated the rules should be changed to make it more transparent

The controversial court which can make life-or-death decisions and send people to jail in secret, came a step closer to being opened up to public and media scrutiny last night.

Addressing a conference in London, Sir James Munby, one of the country’s most senior judges who oversees the shadowy Court of  Protection, indicated the rules should be changed to make it more transparent.

The president of the Family Division of the High Court said it should be treated in the same way as the family courts where media are allowed to attend proceedings. 

Lord Justice Munby was asked to 
consider what steps could be taken to increase the court’s transparency 
by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling earlier this year.

It
was subject to an outcry following revelations by the Mail about Wanda 
Maddocks, who was jailed in secret after trying to remove her father 
from a care home.

The
judge said: ‘My starting point is that, unless there is very good 
reason to the contrary, the [Court of Protection] rules should start off
in the same way [as those governing the family courts], with the same 
starting point, and proceed in a similar fashion.

'One
very striking difference is that, in the family court, any accredited 
media representative has the right to attend all family proceedings 
. . . the starting point in the Court of Protection is completely the 
other way round.

'My 
feeling is that the starting point should be the same in both, so that 
there should be the same kind of presumptive right of media access to 
Court of Protection proceedings, as there are in family proceedings,' the Guardian reported.

Controversial case: Wanda Maddocks was jailed in secret after trying to remove her father from a care home

This
month one of the country’s most senior judges, Lord Neuberger, 
president of the Supreme Court, praised the Mail for exposing the secret
jailing of Mrs Maddocks by the court, which was set up in 2007 under 
Labour’s Mental Capacity Act.

It gave the State draconian powers to intervene in the lives of those deemed unfit to look over their own affairs.

The Mail highlighted Miss Maddocks’s shock when police arrived at her father John’s care home to ‘cart her off to jail’.

She had been sentenced in secret for disobeying court orders by trying to remove him from the home. She served six weeks.

The case forced Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, to order that no one else should ever be jailed in private without the sentence and reasons for it being announced outside the closed courtroom.

Lord Justice Munby is keen to further open up the family courts – which journalists can now attend but are more often than not prevented from reporting the details of a case.

He said that while there were differences between the family court and the Court of Protection, they should be part of a single system. More judgments should be published, so that the public could have confidence that justice was being done.
