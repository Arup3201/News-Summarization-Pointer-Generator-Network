It's not likely to be a day they'll ever forget but new mothers are increasingly asking their partners for 'push presents' to mark the occasion they gave birth.

The trend from the U.S is catching on in the UK, fuelled by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian. She was reportedly given a £500,000 diamond ring from Kanye West after she gave birth to their daughter North this year.

Analysis of conversations on parenting website the BabyCentre's online community over the last three years found that mentions of push presents had increased by 41 per cent in the past 18 months, compared to only a two per cent increase between 2011 and 2012.

A poll of 1,200 BabyCentre mothers also revealed that more than a quarter (27 per cent) were expecting, or had already received, a 'push present' this year.

Diamonds were the most popular gift in the form of an eternity ring with the prices spent ranging from £500 to £1475.

Tablet computers, charm bracelets and designer watches and handbags were also popular gifts to celebrate a new arrival.

Linnea Ingham-Jeffries, from Kent, received a charm bracelet from her husband after her son, Orlan, was born.

She said: 'When
 Orlan was born my husband surprised me with a charm bracelet and three 
charms - a mum one, one with the initial of our son and an owl charm, 
which is the theme of our nursery. I wasn't expecting anything so it was
 such a lovely surprise. My husband bought it for me simply so I'd have 
something unique as a thank you for giving birth.'

Sarah Barrett, BabyCentre's managing editor said the rise in popularity of the trend shows how fathers want to reward their partner for the 'huge physical and emotional changes' they've been though in order to give birth.

She said: 'Whilst Mums are becoming more vocal about push presents this trend also shows a shift in Dads' understanding around the huge physical and emotional changes that their partner has been through. 

'Whilst having a baby is the ultimate present, many Dads want to show how proud they are of their new family and all that Mum has been through with a special gift.'   

Push presents have been common currency in the U.S. since 2007 when a survey of more than 30,000 respondents found that 38 per cent of new mothers had received a one.

It's now the latest trend to cross the Atlantic following 'sip and see' parties - where friends and family are invited for drinks to meet the newborn for the first time.

Baby showers are another pregnancy rite of passage for mothers-to-be that are also becoming more popular in the UK after starting in the U.S.
