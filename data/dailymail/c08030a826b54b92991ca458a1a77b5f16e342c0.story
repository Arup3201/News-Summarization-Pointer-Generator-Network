Police are hunting a pack of women who allegedly dumped a box of live rats into a love rival's Philadelphia home after smashing her windows with baseball bats.

Investigators said an ongoing dispute over a man escalated about 11pm Wednesday, when a woman in her 20s, her mother and about nine other women attacked a 30-year-old woman in her South 28th Street home.

The women allegedly bashed in windows and the outer front door before releasing a number of white rodents.
