A mother-of-two drank herself to death after downing 330 units of alcohol a week, including vodka for breakfast and five bottles of wine a day.

Vicky White's family have just experienced the agony of their first Christmas without her, after she died in July.

The 38-year-old succumbed to liver failure following a 25-year battle with her addiction.  

And for her partner Steve Hough, alcohol was a stark reminder of a missing face at the Christmas dinner table this year.  

Now her children, Jack, 17 and Mia, who celebrated her seventh birthday three days before her Ms White's death, must grow up missing their mother.

Vicky White died of liver failure in July after battling an alcohol addiction for 25 years. She had appeared on the BBC show Panorama to highlight the dangers of excessive drinking

The mother-of-two, 38, from Liverpool managed to quit alcohol several times, but sadly relapsed

Mr Hough, 43, from Liverpool, said: 'Vicky didn't want to drink and she tried so hard to stop, but it just controlled her. She became a different person. 

'She didn't have alcohol secretly stashed around the house - and there was no pattern to her drinking other than she would just hammer it for five or six hours at a time.

'She started drinking again two weeks before she died and she refused to take her medication. I knew from experience that trying to stop her would make her worse.

'Like every family with young children, we always loved Christmas. But this year, our first without her, was hard.

'All Mia wanted for Christmas was to have her mum back again.' 

He said he called an ambulance four days before his partner's death, when she became disorientated.

By the time she was admitted to hospital, she could no longer recognise him, and was vomiting blood.  

'I didn't want the children to see her, but Jack insisted on visiting,' he said.

Shortly after her son's visit, Ms White slipped into a coma and later died from liver failure.

Her partner, Steve Hough, said he hopes telling Ms White's story will help others receive treatment

Mr Hough said: 'My heart breaks for the kids. It took days for me to find the courage to tell Mia that her mummy is an angel in the sky and she was sobbing.

'I just want Vicky's story to be a lesson for others.'

Ms White's partner Steve Hough said there was no pattern to her drinking other than she would just 'hammer it for five or six hours at a time'. 

'She didn't have alcohol secretly stashed around the house and I couldn't say she always drank in the morning or evening,' he said.  

Ms White had been drinking heavily since she was a teenager and by 2011, she came close to death after downing vodka for breakfast followed by five bottles of wine every day – a staggering 330 units a week. 

'She was so bloated that people kept asking when the baby was due,' Mr Hough said.

'Her eyes and skin were yellow and I was really worried about her.'

Ms White, from Liverpool, began drinking cider at 13 with her friends in the local park and by the time she was 18 she was drinking every day.

By her own admission, she came from a stable, loving home and had no problems, yet she found herself addicted to alcohol.

At 18, she met a new boyfriend and at 20, gave birth to Jack, and stopped drinking during her pregnancy.

But after Jack was born, she started turned again to alcohol.

When he was nine months old – on her first night out since the birth – she had a glass of wine with friends.

Soon, she found herself drinking each night.

She progressed from cider to vodka and regularly drank during the day. Her son often missed school and before his Holy Communion ceremony his mother drank two bottles of cider, to the shock of her family. 

In August 2003, just before Jack's eighth birthday, Ms White's mother, Debbie, insisted he went to live with her.

But the decision triggered another downward spiral in Ms White's life and, despite her determination to win him back, she just drank even more.

Having given up alcohol before Mia's birth, Ms White relapsed shortly afterwards, drinking five bottles of wine each day, as well as vodka 

In 2004, aged 28, she met her partner, Steve, then 33.

Ms White told him about her drinking, but did not reveal how serious her problem was.

'I really had no idea she had a problem. I thought she was a social drinker, like me,' he recalled.

The following year, Ms White's drinking escalated and she would down half a bottle of vodka for breakfast.

Doctors warned of the damage her drinking was causing her liver and kidneys.

The wake-up call worked, and Ms White stopped drinking for a time, and her son Jack returned home. 

In July 2007, she and Mr Hough had a daughter, Mia, who despite her mother's addiction was born perfectly healthy.

But soon after Mia's arrival, Ms White found herself drawn in once again by her addiction, drinking five bottles of wine each day as well as vodka.

'She was so bloated that people kept asking when the baby was due,' Mr Hough said. 'Her eyes and skin were yellow and I was really worried about her.'

In Spring 2011, she came close to death after downing vodka for breakfast followed by five bottles of wine every day – a staggering 330 units a week.

She was rushed to hospital and diagnosed with liver failure and acute kidney failure.

Doctors drained 42 litres of fluid from her organs, leaving her five stone lighter.

Mr Hough: 'Vicky so bloated that it took 22 firemen and paramedics to get her down the stairs.

'They had to dismantle the banisters and take the back door off. It was humiliating for her.'

Mr Hough said: 'She was our whole world. I know she tried so hard to stop drinking and I can't feel angry or resentful towards her. I just feel a terrible sadness'

Alcohol causes and contributes to a wide range of serious health problems, accidents and deaths.

The charity Alcohol Concern warns that:

• Alcohol accounts for 80 per cent of deaths from liver disease

• It is the second biggest risk factor for cancer after smoking

It also causes and contributes to numerous health problems including:

• Liver and kidney disease

• Cancers of the mouth and throat, liver, laryngeal, colon and breast cancer

• Pancreatitis

• Heart disease; high blood pressure; stroke 

• Depression

• Foetal alcohol syndrome

In most cases, the relationship between alcohol and disease is 'dose-dependent' - that is the more alcohol consumed, the greater the risk of disease. 

Her plight was featured on Panorama to warn of the dangers of binge drinking. And she was given the stark warning that one more drink could kill her.

This time, she finally took notice.

After two months in hospital, she came home on a walking frame – but full of determination to change her life. Once again, she quit drinking.

But she fell off the wagon again last year, despite doctors' warning that her body could not take much more strain.

'When she wasn't drinking, she became such a good mum,' Mr Hough said: 'She loved walking Mia to school. She wanted so much just to be normal and to care for her family.'

Tragically, she was unable to meet the challenge and, after yet another relapse, sparked by a series of minor upsets, she found herself in hospital again in July.

Four days later, she slipped into a coma and her liver failed, followed by her other major organs. Her family were by her bedside as her life support was withdrawn.

Mr Hough said: 'I feel absolutely lost. I didn't know how to help Vicky when she was alive, and I certainly don't know how to carry on now she has gone.

Alcohol increases the risk of a number of fatal diseases, particularly when consumed in high doses, as this table from the charity Alcohol Concern shows 

'She was our whole world. I know she tried so hard to stop drinking and I can't feel angry or resentful towards her. I just feel a terrible sadness.

'Mia cries all the time and asks for her mummy. I worry how she will cope with the news that Vicky drank herself to death, when she is older.

'Jack is withdrawn and angry. He doesn't drink at all. He's seen what damage it can do.

'Our first Christmas without her was very tough.

'I hadn't made any plans because I couldn't face the day without Vicky - and I had fallen out with her family following her death,' he told MailOnline. 

But to his surprise, on Christmas Eve, Vicky's parents, Chris and Debbie, and sister, Christina, arrived at his home and decorated the house. 

They also cooked a big Christmas lunch and celebrated together, before visiting Ms White's grave in the evening.

Mr Hough said: 'All I tried to do was give the kids the best Christmas I could.

'I know Vicky will be looking down on them, wherever she is - their own guardian angel.'
