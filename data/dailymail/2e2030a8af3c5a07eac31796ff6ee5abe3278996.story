Her job is to report on baseball action, but NESN interviewer Jenny Dell inadvertently became part of the story last night.

Braving the rain, the glamorous television journalist interviewed Boston Red Sox player Jonny Gomes after the team beat the Seattle Mariners to clinch the baseball series.

But the light drizzle was the least of her worries.

Caught in the middle of post-match celebrations, Dell was accidentally drenched with liters of freezing water intended solely for Gomes.

Splash! Mid-interview, a water-cooler was dumped over Red Sox player Jonny Gomes, a TV interview custom

Video of the incident shows Dell chatting with Gomes before he is hit with a bucket-load of icy water.

Dell, caught in the cross-fire of the post-match ritual, also gets saturated.

After a very brief pause, the experienced reporter brushed off the surprise splash. 

Proving her professionalism, Dell kept the interview going with a slight flick of her a hair and a wry smile, without mentioning the mishap.

BostInno reported Dell didn't even mention her 'impromptu involvement' in the player ritual during a post-game press conference.

The good sport later tweeted: '#NeverQuit #RedSox RT @MLB: Good times. #Walkoff', with a picture of the incident.
