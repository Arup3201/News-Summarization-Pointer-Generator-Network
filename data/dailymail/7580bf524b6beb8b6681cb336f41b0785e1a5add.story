Jailed: Driving instructor Ben Holloway has been sentenced to six years in prison for dealing Class A drugs

A Driving instructor turned Breaking Bad-style drugs dealer has been jailed for six years after being caught with cocaine and amphetamines worth £5million he planned to sell to save his  family home.

Benjamin Holloway, 26, claimed he turned to drug dealing to raise £20,000 to stop his property being sold to pay for debts he incurred when his business went under.

Birmingham Crown Court heard that the ‘hard-working’ instructor became increasingly desperate to provide for his family and became mixed up with dangerous drugs gangs.

The case echoes the plot of the hit US TV crime drama Breaking Bad, in which respectable chemistry teacher Walter White turns to drug dealing to provide for his family after learning he has terminal cancer.

White, played by Bryan Cranston, sets up a laboratory making the drug crystal meth to make a lot of money fast.

Holloway was arrested after police pulled over his Ford Focus during routine checks on motorists in Birmingham on August 14.

Officers discovered a huge haul of cocaine and amphetamines in his car.

They then swooped on his £130,000 home in Redditch and found more than 50kg of amphetamines in his garden shed.

Police also recovered drug-making 
equipment and five phones that had been used to make calls to gang 
members in Spain and Holland.

Sentencing
 Holloway, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine and 
amphetamine, Judge Roderick Henderson said: ‘You are a hard worker who 
had never been in trouble with police but you became involved in 
desperately serious offences.

‘You were more than just a courier and had played a significant role in the conspiracy.’

Police
 found Holloway was living beyond the means of a driving instructor, 
with two flat-screen TVs and a baby grand piano in his modest 
semi-detached home.

Defending, Imran Shafi said that more
 powerful drug dealers had exploited Holloway, who was initially 
vulnerable thanks to his financial troubles and then became tempted by 
drug money.

Parallels: The case has some similarities to Breaking Bad, in which chemistry teacher Walter White and his former pupil Jesse Pinkman start manufacturing and distributing methamphetamine

Speaking 
after the case, local driving instructor Donna Scott said that Holloway,
 who had been teaching people how to drive for five years, had behaved 
recklessly.

'He appeared a bit of a wide boy but I never thought he was able to get mixed up anything like this,' she said.

'I
 knew him to say hello to at the driving centre and wasn't too sure 
about him because he used to drive like an idiot, which wasn't good for 
the learners.'
