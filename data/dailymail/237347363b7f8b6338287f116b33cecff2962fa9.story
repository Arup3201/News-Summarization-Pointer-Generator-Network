The Polar Medal awarded to an explorer who came within 12 miles of rescuing Scott of the Antarctic and his team will be auctioned for £30,000 tomorrow.

Apsley Cherry-Garrard was haunted for the rest of his life by not being able reach the four men perished as they returned from the South Pole.

He was one of the party who found the frozen bodies of three of his friends and later wrote in his autobiography the horror of realising how close he came to saving them.

The rare medals are expected to fetch at least £30,000 when they go under the hammer tomorrow

The young explorer's life was shadowed by his Antarctic experiences

When he returned from the Antarctic, he was awarded the Polar Medal and the Royal Geographical Society’s Scott Memorial Medal, which are now going under the hammer.

They have been in the hands of a renowned collector of gallantry medals for the last 50 years and he is now selling them.

Christopher
Hill, of medal specialists Dix Noonan Webb of London, said: 'Cherry-Garrard wrote a book about the expedition and called it "The 
Worst Journey in the World."

'It completely reveals the hardship suffered and the type of character required of the men who went on these expeditions.

'It
is a sad thing in Cherry-Garrard’s case that his life was forever 
shadowed by what could have been had he carried on that bit further.

'Birdie Bowers and Edward Wilson were very close friends of his and he was deeply affected by what happened.'

Captain Scott, Edward Wilson, Lawrence Oates, Henry Bowers and Edgar Evans made it to the South Pole on January 17, 1912, only to find Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had beaten them to it a month before.

On their return journey, the five men endured dreadful conditions and suffered from a lack of food and frostbite.

Meanwhile Cherry-Garrard, who was a 
member of the 11-strong support party, had been ordered to the supply 
depot to re-stock it with food and was meant to meet the group after 
their historic trip.

However, after days of waiting he followed 
orders given to him and returned north to the expedition’s headquarters 
in order to spare the sledge-dogs.

Had he carried on south, and killing 
one dog at a time to feed to the rest after running out of food, he 
would have found the remaining men stranded in their tent after 12 
miles.

Cherry-Garrard left the One Ton Depot on March 10, 1912. Lawrence Oates died on March 16 after famously walking out of the tent to give the others a chance of survival.

Scott, Edward Wilson and Henry ‘Birdie’ Bowers all died on or around March 30.

PO Evans had died on February 17.

Eight
months later, at the end of the Antarctic spring, Cherry-Garrard was a 
member of the search party that went out and found the three men dead in
their tent alongside their diaries.

In a letter dated six months later, 
Cherry-Garrard described his horror at finding the frozen bodies of finding his three teammates.

Cherry-Garrard was a 24-year-old zoologist and went on the expedition to help gather penguin eggs.

Four months before Scott set off on 
his ill-fated trip to the pole, Cherry-Garrard, Bowers and Wilson 
undertook a 60 mile trek to Ross Island to secure three eggs.

The men endured temperatures of -77F and Cherry-Garrard’s teeth chattered so much that many of them shattered.

In his famous journal, Scott wrote on August 2, 1911: 'Cherry-Garrard is slightly puffy in the face and still looks worn.

'It is evident that he has suffered most severely - but Wilson tells me that his spirit never wavered for a moment.'

Cherry-Garrard's collection of 27 letters he sent home from the South Pole went under the hammer with a guide price of £80,000 in October.

In them he wrote: 'We have found the bodies of Scott, Wilson & Bowers, and all their records... Their death was, I am quite sure, not a painful one – for men get callous after a period of great hardship – but the long fight before must have been most terrible.'

He added: 'Theirs is a fine story... Wilson & Bowers had died very quietly, probably in their sleep.'

The then 26-year-old told his mother he had endured 'about the worst time I have ever had... it has been an absolute hell'.

The moving letters, that were auctioned last year, were dated about a year before the doomed trip
