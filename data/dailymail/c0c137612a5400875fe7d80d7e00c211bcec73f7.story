Kieran Richardson is expected to have a medical at Aston Villa on Friday ahead of his proposed transfer for an undisclosed fee.

The 29-year-old had been the subject of interest from West Ham, West Brom and Crystal Palace, but Villa now seem poised to sign him.

Richardson had seemed keen to stay in London following Fulham’s relegation, but the arrival of Roy Keane at Villa Park as Paul Lambert’s number two is believed to have swayed his decision.

Born: London, October 21 1984 (age 29)

2002-2007: Man United (41 apps, 2 gls)

2005-2005: West Brom (loan) (12 apps, 3 gls)

2007-2012: Sunderland (134 apps, 14 gls)

2012-NOW: Fulham (44 apps, 5 gls)

2005-2006: England (8 caps, 2 gls)

Keane was captain of Manchester United when Richardson was emerging through the ranks at Old Trafford, and made him Sunderland’s record signing in 2007 while manager.

Owner Randy Lerner has made it clear to Lambert there will be little funds for new signings in this transfer window.

And the acquisition of the former England midfielder is seen as an astute piece of business due to his versatility that allows him to play left-back, midfield and in an attacking role.

Fulham are still dealing with the financial ramifications of their relegation from the Premier League and will let the former Black Cat midfielder leave for a modest fee.

The news of Richardson’s likely switch to Villa Park will come as a blow to West Brom where he is still fondly remembered after playing an integral role in helping retaining their Premier League status in 2005.
