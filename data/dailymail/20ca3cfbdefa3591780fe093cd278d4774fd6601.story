A 15-year-old girl abducted by three teenage boys, including her ex-boyfriend, was miraculously rescued from the trunk of a stolen car - after calling for help on her cell phone.

The teenager's harrowing two-hour ordeal began at 7.30am this morning when the masked juveniles - one carrying a handgun - pulled her into the car as she walked to school in Yakima, Washington.

But in a stroke of luck, the boys failed to take the frightened girl's phone or tie her up, leaving her free to give directions to a 911 dispatcher.

Frightening: The teenage girl's harrowing ordeal began in a quiet neighborhood near 64th and Terry Avenues in Yakima, Washington

On the ball: Yakima Police Spokesperson Rod Light said information provided by the girl about road surfaces and sounds helped cops track her down

Yakima Herald reported the driver traveled west on the State Route 410 for some time before dropping off two of the kidnappers at Highland High school.

The car then traveled to Weikel Road before taking a back way to Naches and heading west to Chinook Pass near Bumping Lake.

About two hours after being snatched from the street, troopers saved the girl after stopping the car on State Route 410.

Yakima
 Police Department spokesman Captain Rod Light told KIMATV.com police found the girl by tracking her cell phone. She was unharmed.

'She wasn't able to give accurate 
directions. She was able to give some information as to the road 
surfaces, the sounds,' he said.

Captain Light said the girl provided a key clue when she reported seeing snow through a hole in the trunk.

'I think when they're up in the mountains now, there's only two ways to go,' Light said.

'I mean generally from here if you're going to the mountains when there's snow, it's going to be White Pass or Chinook Pass.'

Police arrested the teenage boys, with Captain Light saying the girl was lucky to be alive.

'Weâ€™re not even sure what his (the kidnapper)
intent was, but obviously it wasnâ€™t good,' he said.

'So, thank goodness, she
 had a cellphone. A good ending to a bad situation.'
