They are the fearless Russian freedivers who enjoy nothing more than a dip in freezing Arctic seas with little more than a wetsuit and gloves to keep out the cold.

Hardened swimmers gather ever year for a bone-chilling plunge at the Arctic Circle Dive Centre by the White Sea in Karelia, Northern Russia.

Despite temperatures in the water dipping as low as minus two, the people who take part insist they actually enjoy the experience.

Weightless looking divers seem to glide effortlessly through the green, staring at the camera in front, as if ready to embrace it

A diver takes deep breaths with arms stretched out preparing to plunge in to the icy waters of Arctic Russia. This swimmer is one of many Russian free divers who gather each year at the Arctic Circle Dive Centre by the White Sea in Karelia, Northern Russia

Bottoms up: A swimmer flips over and heads for the depths for a dive lasting up to 20 minutes in the bitterly cold water

They were joined by photographer Franco 
Banfi, 56, from Cadro, Switzerland, who had flown with friends to 
Kuusamo in Finland, before driving to the centre.

Using a spidery looking underwater camera, he captured the scenes as groups of divers took it in turns to brave the icy depths.

Wearing just seven millimetre thick wetsuits, the divers enter waters of minus two degrees for 15 to 20 minutes - before they are forced to leave and warm themselves up.

The sea water can reach sub zero temperatures due to its salt-content while the ice that covers it contains very little salt.

Below the surface, an ethereal world of green waits to greet them.

The striking emerald colours are created by hundreds of microscopic planktonic algae that comprise the core of marine life.

Absorbing the red light of the sun's rays, the algae spreads to create a striking green glow across the water.

Franco said: 'The more life there is in the sea, the more phytoplankton there is. This is what, strangely, turns the White Sea green.'

The sea water may be below zero but despite the clear blue skies above, temperatures above ground dipped to almost minus 20 degrees Celsius

Thick-clothed spectators peer through the triangular holes cut in the ice - known in Russia as 'maina'

His striking images capture the tranquil scenes both above and below the ice.

Russian freedivers train themselves at the Diving Centre to stay outside for even longer, diving deeper and deeper in the icy water

With temperatures above ground dipping to almost minus 20 degrees, Franco said he could only stay outside for an hour before his hands got too cold to work the camera.

Yet the brave - or crazy - Russian free divers will go inside the dive centre and train themselves to stay outside for even longer, diving deeper and deeper in the icy water.

Franco said: 'It's very good fun and people do really enjoy it, especially when there is good weather and the outside temperature increases!'
