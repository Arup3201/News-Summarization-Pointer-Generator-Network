A man and a boy have been found dead after they were swept off rocks near the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco yesterday afternoon.

The pair, 37-year-old Juan Escamillo-Rojas and his son Juan Carlos Escamillo-Monroy, 9, were pulled into the ocean by large waves while they were fishing just before 5pm.

Southern Marin fire Battalion Chief Matt Barnes said a third man was also swept off the rocks into the frigid waters but he managed to get back to shore.

The trio was on a rocky coastline just northwest of the bridge in the Marin Headlands. The area is exposed to large swells that roll in from the Pacific.

'It's not an ideal place to fish, it's real rocky there,' Barnes said.

After he fought his way to shore, the survivor ran to a nearby parking lot where he flagged down a passerby who called 911.

The bodies of the victims were plucked from the water at about 5.25pm by a Tiburon Fire Department boat and the Coast Guard.

They were about 100 yards offshore when they were found and had spent more than 30 minutes in the icy waters before rescuers pulled them onto a fire boat.

The pair was brought to the Coast Guard station at Horeshoe Cove, where they were pronounced dead, according to SFGate.com.

'The water is very cold out there,' Barnes told the news website, noting that a cause of death had not been determined. 'The air is very cold this time of year. Hypothermia could have played a factor.'

Barnes said the survivor was treated and released at the scene.

It is not clear whether the father and son were related to the third man. Barnes said the survivor didn't speak English, which prevented an immediate interview.

The Marin County Coroner's Office is investigating the deaths.
