It may have taken 36 years but the iconic holographic chess game from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope just took a step closer to reality thanks to a pair of augmented and virtual reality specs.

The castAR system uses a pair of glasses fitted with a micro-projector on each lens that beams images in 3D onto a specially-designed flat surface.

These images can then be moved and interacted with using a remote control wand.

Holochess was a game played in Star Wars. This scene shows the game being played by C-3PO, pictured left, and Chewbacca, right. It used holograms of playing pieces, such as aliens. The rules differed from regular chess, as it was played on a circular board, rather than square

CastAR's system is made of a pair of glasses and a surface.

The frames of the glasses are fitted with two micro-projectors - one for each eye.

Each projector beams a 
perspective view of a stereoscopic 3D image onto the retro-reflective surface.

A tiny camera, fitted between the projectors, scans for infrared 
identification markers placed on this surface.

The camera uses these 
markers to precisely track a player's head position and orientation in the 
physical world.

The so-called Magic Wand can be used as a joystick and a '3D input device.'

The handheld part of the wand has buttons, a trigger, and a thumb 
stick. The wand also tracks its own movement in 3D space, allowing players to interact with virtual environments.

A Kickstarter project has now launched in the hope of raising $400,000 (£250,000) to fund production of this system. 

'CastAR is a projected augmented reality system that displays 
holographic-like 3D projections right in front of you,' said the system's Washington-based maker Technical Illusions.

'Star Wars: 
Episode IV – A New Hope sparked our imaginations of what might be 
possible in the future by showing R2-D2 and Chewbacca playing a 
holographic chess-style game.

'It has taken years for this technological dream to come to reality, but 
with castAR, that reality can be yours.'

CastAR's system is made of a pair of glasses and a surface. The frames of the glasses are fitted with two micro-projectors - one for each eye.

Each projector beams a 
perspective view of a stereoscopic 3D image onto the retro-reflective surface.

A tiny camera, fitted between the projectors, scans for infrared 
identification markers placed on this surface.

This
 camera has a built-in tracking system that detects slight movements of a
 player's eyes and hands, and moves the images so they stay in line with
 their head.

This means a player's eyes 
focus on the projected image at a 'very natural and comfortable viewing 
distance.'

A tracking grid sits 
underneath the retro-reflective surface and when used with tags, or specially created game boards, can track
 physical objects including miniature figures, cards, game pieces, or 
anything else that fits on top of the surface.

The camera uses these 
markers to precisely track a player's head position and orientation in the 
physical world. Software can then adjust how the 
holographic scene should appear.

The glasses get its video 
signal through an HDMI connection and the camera is connected by a USB 
port to a PC.

Technical Illusions said it is still experimenting with linking the glasses to other mobile devices.

The Kickstarter project runs until 14 November and has already raised more than half the target amount.

According to the pledge information, a Magic Wand costs $60 (£38) and a starter pack that includes the glasses and the surface is $189 (£118).
