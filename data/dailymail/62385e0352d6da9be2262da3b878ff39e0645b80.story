England may have recorded just one victory in six matches, but that doesn't appear to have dampened these supporters’ spirits ahead of Monday night’s clash in Switzerland.

The Three Lions begin their qualification campaign for Euro 2016 with a tricky trip to Basle.

And Roy Hodgson’s side start the match on the back foot after a tortuous World Cup campaign and a lacklustre 1-0 win over Norway on Wednesday.

I'll drink to that: The fans appeared to be in good spirits despite England's poor run of form

But the travelling support appeared to be enjoying their time in Switzerland ahead of England’s Group E opener.

Fabian Delph is in line to make a shock start for the away side with Hodgson set to deploy the Aston Villa midfielder in a 4-3-3 formation.

Delph has played just 21 minutes of senior international football, after replacing Jack Wilshere at Wembley on Wednesday.

Jordan Henderson, Jack Wilshere and Delph are expected to be the three in England’s midfield as Hodgson attempts to add some more muscle in that area, while Danny Welbeck is in for injured Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge.

Henderson was taken off in training on Sunday night with an injury to his right leg, but Hodgson is hopeful the Liverpool man will be fit. James Milner would be the likely replacement if Henderson fails to recover.

Captain Wayne Rooney said: ‘Us as a team, not just myself, we back Roy 100 per cent.

‘We made that clear after we went out of the World Cup — he brings ideas to us.

‘We know that the World Cup was a disappointment, but I still feel we can move forward as a team

'We're progressing all the time. I think that will show in the next two years. The lads are working hard to get the best out of the ideas Roy is showing us.'

All smiles: Wayne Rooney will lead England out against Switzerland in tonight's qualifier
