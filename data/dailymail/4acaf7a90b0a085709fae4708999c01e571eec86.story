On the dancefloor, they were a picture of athleticism.

Away from it, however, it is a slightly different story for the Strictly Come Dancing stars.

Actresses Denise van Outen, 38 and Dani Harmer, 23 and Lisa Riley, 36, were all seen puffing away on cigarettes as they took a break from rehearsals ahead of the Strictly tour.

Even professional dancers Pasha Kovalev, 32, and James Jordan, 34, snuck out to smoke with ex-cricketer Phil Tufnell, 46.

Kate Thornton, 39, who is hosting the live shows, nipped out for a quick smoke while chatting on her phone.

And judge Craig Revel Horwood, 48, also enjoyed a cigarette as he sparked up outside the studios.

The group are all preparing for the Strictly Come Dancing live tour which begins later this month.

They will be joined on the tour by Tracey Beaker, presenter Fern Britton and former England Cricket captain and legend Michael Vaughan.

Denise van Outen once claimed she didn’t smoke saying: ‘I don’t smoke and rarely drink because I hate hangovers.

'I suppose I’m a girl with no vices.’

The latest series saw Olympian Louis Smith triumph beating Girls Aloud star Kimberly Walsh in the final.

The series, which finished last month, attracted an average of just under 11 million viewers.
