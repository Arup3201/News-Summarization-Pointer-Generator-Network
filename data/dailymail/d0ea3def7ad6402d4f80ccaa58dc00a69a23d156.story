It was a bit of a stretch, but a new record was set for the World’s Largest Prenatal Class in China when 505 pregnant women practised yoga together.

Dressed in purple leotards, the women made for quite a sight in Changsha, the capital of southern China's Hunan Province.

The 505 women, who all produced medical proof showing they are 12 weeks or more pregnant, did the group yoga in Juzizhou Park for 37 minutes and 28 seconds under the watchful eye of Guinness Record officials.

Purple pose: Over 500 women practicing yoga as they attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the largest prenatal yoga class, in Changsha, central Hunan province

And stretch: The 505 women, who all produced medical proof showing they are 12 weeks or more pregnant, did the group yoga in Juzizhou Park for 37 minutes and 28 seconds

They broke the previous record of 423 pregnant women doing yoga together that was set in Shenzhen, southern China's Guangdong Province, in 2013.

The achievement follows the news that two of the U.S.’s biggest denim brands are claiming that yoga pants are encroaching on their territory – and affecting their sales as a result.

GAP’s CEO Glenn Murphy and Levi’s President and CEO Chip Bergh have both made comments about how the leggings’ popularization as an everyday item has lessened consumers’ demand for jeans.

‘We’re actually losing consumption to yoga pants,’ Mr Bergh told Yahoo! last week, adding: ‘What used to be a premium jeans occasion for women is now socially acceptable to be a yoga pants occasion, and shame on us as a category leaders for letting that happen.’

The brand’s numbers tell that exact story. Levi’s has experienced a near $3billion fall in revenues since 1995, which have now stalled at $4.6billion.

The demand for yoga pants during the work day has become so intensified that in January, Betabrand released a stretchy dress pant that could be worn at a desk or on the floor of an asana room.
