Christian Estrosi, deputy mayor of Nice and a member of the conservative UMP party, signed the municipal order, citing 'intolerable behavior that disrupts public tranquility.'

'Since the beginning of the World Cup, we are unfortunately confronted with intolerable behavior that is harmful to the public peace. We cannot accept these excesses,' Mr Estrosi said in the statement.Foreign flags will be banned from 6pm until 4am.
