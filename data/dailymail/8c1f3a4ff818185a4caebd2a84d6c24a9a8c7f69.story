George Groves and James DeGale had to be pulled apart after a heated exchange of words following the weigh-in for their respective fights on Saturday night.

Both Groves' wife and DeGale's mum were involved in the melee which saw the warring pair go head to head backstage.

Both camps waded in before the respective security personnel intervened.

The two super-middleweights have been bitter rivals since they were both amateurs at the same gym.

Groves beat DeGale in 2011 at the O2 in London and a rematch next summer appears inevitable.

Promoter Eddie Hearn told Sportsmail: 'The two camps came together and James DeGale and George Groves were face to face.

'Family members and team members were involved and both fighters' security were called and they were pulled apart.' 

Groves takes on Denis Douglin at the Echo Arena on the undercard of Nathan Cleverly's grudge match with Tony Bellew while DeGale faces former world title challenger Marco Antonio Periban.

Both opponents failed to make weight but while Douglin lost the excess 4oz, Periban was still 1lb over 90 minutes later.

DeGale was happy for the fight to go ahead but will be much the smaller man in the ring.
