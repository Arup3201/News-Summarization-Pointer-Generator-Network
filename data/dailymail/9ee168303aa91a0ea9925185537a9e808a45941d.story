Death: Deborah Levey, 44, was found dead at her home in Chichester, West Sussex in January 2013

A mother was murdered by her ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ lover weeks after she had a hysterectomy to beat cervical cancer, a court heard.

Phillip Brown allegedly smothered Debbie Levey, 44, in the living room of her country cottage, having told her: ‘You’ve taken away our chances of having a baby.’

Friends said the couple’s on-off relationship veered from ‘a Mills and Boon romance to a Stephen King horror’.

Miss Levey tried to break up with Brown, whom she had described as a Jekyll and Hyde character, two months before her death after finding out he stole £10 from her.

However, the ‘obsessive’ Brown would not take no for an answer, Lewes Crown Court heard.

The prosecution told how Miss Levey, a care home worker from East Ashling, West Sussex, was bombarded with text messages.

Mark Dennis QC said Brown would proclaim his love for the mother of one – but then send aggressive messages. In some he threatened to kill himself, and sent a picture of his own slashed wrists.

Mr Dennis continued: ‘Most hurtful and spiteful of all was a message prior to her operation in which he expressed the hope that she would die [afterwards], adding that “you’ve taken our chances away of having a baby”.’

The pair, who had both been married and divorced twice before, met through work in January 2012 and began ‘an intense and highly charged relationship’, the court heard.

Claims: Miss Levey (pictured) and Brown had an 'intense and highly charged relationship', the court heard

The
 couple had talked about getting engaged, and Miss Levey had an earlier 
sterilisation procedure reversed in the hope of giving Brown a baby.

However,
 she tried to break things off that November, just before her 
hysterectomy, when Brown sold some jewellery for her only to 
short-change her by £10.

The
 court heard that on the night before her death last January, Miss Levey
 told neighbour Alison McQuaid: ‘I fear for my life with that man.’

The witness added: ‘He was a constant presence, constantly abusive to her. She said she was at her wits’ end.’

'Foul play': Following the murder, Brown allegedly tried to cover his tracks by sending text messages to Miss Levey expressing concern that she was not replying

Miss
 Levey was found dead at Cherry Tree Cottage the next morning with fresh
 love-bites on her neck when a colleague called in on her ahead of a 
planned trip that day.

The victim’s mobile phone was in the fish tank.

Mr
 Dennis said a post-mortem examination found no natural cause of death 
but there were ‘tell-tale signs’ of asphyxia by suffocation.

The prosecution said Brown’s DNA was found on Miss Levey’s face, hands and left foot, and matched the saliva on her neck.

Mr
 Dennis said: ‘Having spent time together, both drinking and engaging in
 no doubt earnest conversation about their future, there came a point 
when the fragility of their relationship was exposed once again.

Denial: Brown, who denies one count of murder, says he was not at Miss Levey's house on the night  she died

'The
 deceased, who was by then heavily in drink, would have been in no 
position to have resisted a sudden outburst of aggression at the hands 
of the defendant.’

The 
prosecution said Brown then tried to cover his tracks by sending text 
messages to Miss Levey expressing concern that she was not replying.

Brown, who denies one count of murder, says he was not at Miss Levey’s house on the night of her death.

The trial continues.
