Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova is out of the Australian Open, beaten 6-4, 7-5 by 19-year-old American Madison Keys.

At 5-5 in the final set, Keys, coached by three-time Grand Slam singles champion Lindsay Davenport, got the pivotal break of serve. 

She held in the next game, screaming with delight when Kvitova netted a backhand on match point.

'My hands are still shaking,' Keys said in an on-court interview. 'I'm really happy that I served that (last) game out. Right now I can't even process anything. I am just so excited and excited to play Maddy in the next round.'

World number 35 Keys, who will celebrate her 20th birthday next month, is coached by three-time grand slam winner Lindsay Davenport and Davenport's husband Jon Leach.

'Lindsay and Jon have been amazing,' she added. 'It's been a great off-season, I learned a lot and I'm just really happy they are here supporting me.'

World No 1 Serena Williams is also in the same half of the draw as her US compatriots

Keys will play another American, Madison Brengle, in the round of 16, guaranteeing at least one U.S. player in the quarterfinals. 

Serena and Venus Williams also remain in the singles draw, also in the same half as Brengle and Keys.

Last year, Thailand's Luksika Kumkhum, playing just her second Grand Slam tournament, upset Kvitova in the first round at Melbourne Park.
