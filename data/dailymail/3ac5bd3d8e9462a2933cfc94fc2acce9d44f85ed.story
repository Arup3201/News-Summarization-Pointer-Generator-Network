A grandfather has been arrested in connection with the death of a baby over 40-years-ago.

Gary Warwick, 62, was snagged Thursday at a Portage, IN., restaurant by authorities from three separate agencies. He has been charged with murder in connection with the death of Joseph Henry Abernathy III, a one-year-old toddler found dead on Dec 30, 1972.

Mr Warwick’s arrest was carried out by US Marshals, Portage Police and the St Clair County Sheriff, according to reports.

The wanted man was long-suspected in the baby’s brutal beating death, according to BND.

Long-since gone cold, the case was reopened last year by the Sheriff after seeing a YouTube video titled ‘Justice for Joey.’

A
subsequent investigation spanning Indiana and Arkansas led 
investigators to arrest Mr Warwick at the Texas Roadhouse restaurant in 
Portage last week, said the Times.

Despite a history of not fleeing, the 
accused baby-killer’s bail was set at a whopping $5million, according to
reports, to which attorney James Gomric vehemently protested.

‘Warwick lived in the same city for decades with his wife, children and grandchildren. He did not flee even though he knew charges were possible,’ Mr Gomric told BND.

‘The setting of a $5 million bail is inappropriate in this case,’ the lawyer said to BND, declining to comment further.

An assistant softball coach with Purdue University, Mr Warwick initially faced murder charges over the toddler’s death in 1973, which multiple reports said were dismissed. 

Officials reportedly believed that the baby hit his head falling out of the crib, causing him to die, according to Northwest Indiana Times.

‘Back in 1972, if you told someone a baby fell out of a crib, then that's what people thought had happened,’ Sheriff Rick Watson told the St Louis Post-Dispatch, according to the Times.

In the time since, Mr Warwick has seen his family grow to two married daughters and three grandchildren, according to the school’s website. Mr Warwick was not related to the baby, but lived in the same house as him at the time of his death.

Investigators are still building their case against their man, but are confident.

‘It's finally been brought to closure, but it's never over. It's innocent until proven guilty, and that's why the investigation continues,’ the Sheriff told NWI.
