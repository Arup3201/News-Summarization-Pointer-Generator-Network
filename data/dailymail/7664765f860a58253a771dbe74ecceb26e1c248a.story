The parents of Shane Montgomery, a 21-year-old student who went missing in the early hours of Thanksgiving after leaving a Philadelphia bar, have confirmed that his body has finally been found.

Karen and Kevin Montgomery watched as diver's pulled their son's body from the Schuylkill River in Manayunk about 12.15pm on Saturday.

The sad scene brought to an end a widespread month-long search for the West Chester University senior, with a $65,000 reward on offer for information concerning his disappearance.

'Today we have done what we have promised,' Karen Montgomery told NBC Philadelphia today.

'We have found and we brought Shane home.' 

Found: The body of Shane Montgomery, pictured, was recovered from the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia on Saturday, close to where he was last seen on November 27

Search: Teams had been searching the nearby canal for the last month but turned up no signs. Montgomery's body was found Saturday in the water behind the Manayunk Street Brewery

Bittersweet: His heartbroken parents, Karen and Kevin Montgomery,spoke with the media after their son's body was discovered today

Recovered: Different clues lead search crews to Montgomery's body, especially the discovery of a set of keys nearby (left) in the Schuylkill River two weeks ago. Manayunk is a neighborhood of Philadelphia (top right)

Two weeks earlier divers found a set of keys belonging to Montgomery in the same section of water after they were tested on his parents' house. 

Montgomery was last seen leaving a bar in Manayunk in the early hours of Thanksgiving Day, having returned home from college for the holidays, and was caught on surveillance footage heading towards a parking lot.

The search predominantly focused on the nearby Manayunk Canal, with police not suspecting foul play. 

His heartbroken parents were sure something unfortunate had happened to their son. 

'My son is somewhere in that river, and I need to find him and I need to bring him home,' Karen Montgomery previously said. 

Montgomery had been escorted out of Kildare's bar in Manayunk - a neighborhood of Philadelphia  -at 1.50am on November 27 after he stumbled over the DJ's table.

Last seen: The student was seen on surveillance footage crossing a footbridge, pictured, over the Manayunk Canal on November 27 - although the actual footage has not yet been released by police

Search: His disappearance has sparked a huge search involving the FBI, K-9 units and helicopters

He had spent the night of November 26 there with friends. 

It later emerged that he had a tab for $17 at the bar, indicating that staff had not served him an excessive amount of alcohol. 

The bar's owner said that he did not seem drunk and, when he accidentally bumped into the table, he was polite about it.

One of the bar's employees walked him to the exit and saw him leave.

Surveillance footage captured him walking across a footbridge over the Manayunk Canal to a parking lot on the other side. He was not seen returning.

The footage has been withheld by authorities. 

Missing: Montgomery, a student at West Chester University, had a distinct Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder

The FBI has joined the search and K-9s, helicopters and marine units have been used to help find the student - but there has been no sign of him.  

His father, Kevin, previously told NBC: 'We're waiting for him to walk in the door, but you realize that each hour goes... it's just harder and harder.'
