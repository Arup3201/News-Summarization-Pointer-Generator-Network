Chinese president Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan were welcomed at Government House in Canberra for a cuddle with a cute wombat, a tour of the grounds to see the kangaroos and to sign a ground breaking trade deal which will eventually see 95 per cent of Australian exports will enter China tariff-free.
