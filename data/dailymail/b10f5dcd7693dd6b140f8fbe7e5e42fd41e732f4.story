Today show star Savannah Guthrie has admitted she and her fianc√© Michael Feldman are now finally planning their wedding - after months of 'procrastinating'.

The slender TV host, 41, got engaged to her boyfriend of four years, political consultant and former Democratic adviser Mike Feldman, in May during a trip to the Turcs and Caicos Islands

And when asked about their wedding plans, Savannah told MailOnline today: 'It took us four years to get married - we're huge procrastinators!

'When we started to talk about the kind of wedding we wanted, we didn't know how many people to invite, where to have it, small or large...and then we'd give up and go and watch reality TV.

'But now we're going to start organising, we will get married soon! Mike's a great guy, he's very smart and sweet.'

Mr Feldman, 44, was a former aide to Al Gore and heads up a successful communications advisory firm based in Washington, D.C. and New York.

And Savannah recently admitted to Elle magazine: 'I would love to have kids. I hope so, if we're lucky and blessed, but who knows what life holds, you know? I'm 41 years old.'

While she works in a newsroom, Savannah admitted no-one noticed her large diamond engagement ring after she returned to work following Mike's proposal.

Laughing, she recalled: 'I came in to work, I thought people would notice, but when they didn't, I lifted my hand up, and it wasn't until I was on set that a producer came over to me before we went on air and said 'what is that on your finger?!' They'd all been zooming in on the ring in the control room.'

Her co-star Matt Lauer, she said, insisted that he HAD noticed the ring - but said he had not wanted to be the first to ask if she was engaged. However, he was the first to tweet a picture of the amazing sparkler.

After a troubled year, where the NBC breakfast show lost its top slot title to ABC's Good Morning America and was embroiled in a row over former host Anne Curry's firing, Savannah said: 'I feel like it's just clicking now.'

Although Matt's NBC contract expires 
at the end of 2014, he insisted he had no 
plans to leave Today, adding: 'The new direction of the show has me more 
invigorated than I've been in a long time.'

On Monday, Matt and Savannah will launch the newly revamped Studio 1A at Rockefeller Plaza, featuring a mostly orange high-tech set and updated sunrise logo, as part of a huge bid to revamp the actual show.

New NBC News president Deborah Turness, a Brit who has been in the job for five weeks after running ITV News in London, insisted:
'We are a news show. The No. 1 reason (viewers) tune in to our show is 
to find out what's going on in the world. It's about setting the agenda 
and getting the exclusives. We can do this better than anyone else.'

She referred to a string of recent exclusives including Matt's interview with shamed TV chef Paula Deen, Savannah's chat with disgraced New York Mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner and an interview with Bradley Manning's lawyer David Coombs who revealed his client now wanted to be known as Chelsea - and was transitioning to a woman.

The set is not yet finished yet- and the actual desk which will now be placed on a revolving floor has yet to be moved in, and Savannah said: 'I think we'll be here all weekend, we'll need to have some rehearsal, we need to work out what looks good, and the crew need to work things out. But it's exciting for all of us.'

For the past month, the Today show gang have been hosting outside on Rockefeller Plaza.

But now Al Roker gets his own huge interactive 
weather screen and new Today show member Carson Daly, announced today, 
will be running the Orange Room, a new digital studio, that will be used
to monitor social media discussion.

And the set was not the only thing to have a makeover lately as Savannah recently debuted red hair.

She revealed she had not told any of her producers and did not ask for any permission, saying: 'I just turned up and they said 'why did you do that?!

'I didn't go into the salon with this in mind - I was this close from going blonde. But I like it.'

Joy: Savannah drank champagne with Kathie Lee and Hoda as they chatted about the engagement
