Thirteen people have been taken to hospital, two with serious injuries, after a coach carrying passengers home after a work party in London collided with a Tesco lorry.

The crash took place on the A1 northbound carriageway between Buckden and Brampton, Cambridgeshire, at 5.35 this morning.

Two people suffered serious injuries in the crash, which involved the articulated lorry and a Redwing Coach traveling to Newcastle with two drivers and 45 passengers on board.

Damage: The front of the coach, which was traveling from London to Newcastle, was completely smashed

Collision: Two people were seriously injured in the crash, which happened on the northbound A1 carriageway between Brampton and Buckden, Cambridge. 11 others were taken to hospital with more minor injuries

The injured were taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.

Another 11 people with less serious injuries were taken to Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Cambridge.

29 passengers were assessed for injuries at the scene before being taken to a centre in St Neots.

The coach driver, from London-based company, is being hailed a hero for spotting the lorry and preventing an even more serious accident.

A driver, who witnessed the crash but did not want to be named, said: 'I saw lots of young people standing on the side of the road, all dressed up as if they had been on a big night out.'

Poor weather conditions - including heavy rain overnight - may have been a contributing factor.

Hurt: 29 passengers of the coach were treated at the scene before they were taken to a centre in St Neots

The service added they were on the scene within six minutes, saying: 'Two patients were taken to Addenbrookes Hospital with serious injuries and eleven patients were taken to Hinchingbrooke Hospital with minor injuries.

'A further 29 people were taken to a local reception centre in St Neots.'

The ambulance service initiated its major Incident plan due to the potential number of patients involved, but this was stood down at just after 7.30am when all people involved had been transported away from the scene.

Aftermath: The Tesco lorry came to a stop on its side across the A1 dual carriageway, pictured

Recovery: This afternoon, crews began working on the wreckage of the crash, pictured, which remains at the side of the road

Five ambulance crews, three rapid response vehicles, four officers and the hazardous area response team (HART) were sent to the scene.

Cambridge Fire and Rescue Service added: 'At 5.35am on Sunday two crews from St Neots and one crew from Huntingdon was called to a road traffic collision on the A1 northbound between Little Paxton and Buckden.

'The lorry was overturned and across the carriage way.  Due to the impact both the driver and co-driver of the coach were trapped and all the other occupants were suffering various degrees of minor impact injuries.

'Owing to the large number of casualties, the ambulance service declared a major incident and triage was established at the scene. 

'As a fire and rescue service we began supporting our colleagues with the large volume of casualties whilst simultaneously extricating the two casualties using specialist cutting equipment.  None of the casualties are believed to have life threatening injuries.'

Rescue: Fire and Ambulance services arrived on the scene, pictured, shortly after the crash at 5.35am
