American fur designer Dennis Basso is launching a collection of luxury clothing for girls aged four to 12; which includes a sable fur coat priced at an eye-watering £30,000.

'In today’s world, we’re getting to a point where people are doing what they want to do,' Mr Basso, 60, told WWD. 'For some, it’s too much. For others, it’s not.'

The collection, which will debut this autumn at Harrods in London - Europe's largest and most extravagant department store - also features a £2,500 embroidered party dress.

His dark brown, knee-swinging coat is crafted from the skin and fur of a sable - fluffy Russian mammals which somewhat resemble stoats or ferrets - and is modelled by a pretty but decidedly sulky-looking young girl.

Mr Basso - who launched his business 31 years ago selling animal pelts out of the trunk of a rented car, and now counts Debra Messing, Mary J Blige and Olivia Palermo as customers - correctly identifies that his kids collection is not to be larked around in.

'These are not the kind of clothes to go to school in or to go out and play in,' he said. 'These are dresses for special occasions and weddings.'

The line is sprinkled with beading and feather embellishments and Mr Basso says he has attempted to translate the same 'quality and sophistication' over from his women's collection, which has its flagship store on New York's Madison Avenue, and sells for tens of thousands of dollars.

Mr Basso, who is married to long-time partner Michael Cominotto, is on the board for a number of children's charities, and holds them particularly close to his heart.

He claims he designed the collection after attending numerous social events and noticing a lack of suitable attire for young girls.

'I love happy things, so designing for beautiful little girls was an easy decision for me,' he said.

Happy is not an adjective animal rights campaigners PETA would use to describe Mr Basso's latest fashion endeavour.

'Sales of fur and other animal skins are on a continuous decline'

'Dennis Basso fails to understand that children have a natural empathy for animals, so his fur coats for young girls couldn't be more out of touch,' PETA director Colleen O'Brien tells MailOnline. 'Sales of fur and other animal skins are on a continuous decline, as more and more people see PETA's videos of fur farms.

'Many don't want to contribute to the suffering of animals who are confined to cramped, filthy cages for life and then finally drowned, beaten to death, strangled, electrocuted, or even skinned alive.

'Role models ranging from Carrie Underwood to Kesha shun fur, and their millions of fans follow suit. No young girl in her right mind would ever see this cruelty as a "happy thing."'
