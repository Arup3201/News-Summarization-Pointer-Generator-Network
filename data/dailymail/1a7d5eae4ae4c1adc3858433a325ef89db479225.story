Tom DeLay says he has God to thank for his acquittal on charges he laundered money for the Republican Party.

The disgraced politician turned Dancing With the Stars alum said he was on his knees in prayer Thursday when he learned his conviction on charges he funneled corporate money to Republican candidates had been overturned.

The Texas 3rd Court of Appeals deemed the evidence ‘legally insufficient’ and reversed a jury’s 2010 decision to convict.

First of all, I'd like to thank God: Disgraced former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay thanks God for his overturned money laundering conviction

While lunching in the Capitol with prominent religious conservatives, the 66-year-old Texan said his lawyer called with the news.

'We were all basically on our knees praying and our lawyer calls and says, "You're a free man,"' he said. 'This was an outrageous criminalization of politics and I'm so glad that they wrote the ruling that they did.'

The attorney, Brian Wice, said DeLay felt validated by Thursday’s ruling.

‘He’s ecstatic. He’s gratified. He’s just a little bit numb,’ Wice said. ‘I’m hoping with today’s victory, he will be able to resume his life as he once knew it.’

DeLay was found guilty of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering for helping illegally funnel corporate money to Texas candidates in 2002. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but his sentence was on hold while his case made its way through the appellate process.

Wice was thrilled, as well.

If the trench coat don't fit: DeLay is seen leaving an Austin, Texas jail after posting an appeals bond in 2011. On Thursday, his 2010 conviction was thrown out by a Texas appeals court that called the evidence 'legally insufficient'

According to the American-Statesman, the lawyer said he told his client: ‘When I see you, I’m going to dump a Gatorade bucket over your head. We won the Super Bowl.’

Wice said the state could appeal to the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals, the state’s highest criminal court. Wice said he was confident DeLay would win again if necessary.

Meanhile, Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg promised, 'We are absolutely going to appeal.'

Star turn: Here, DeLay smiles as he leaves a lunch meeting on Capitol Hill, Thursday. Since his 2010 conviction, one of the former Congressman's more notable turns in the spotlight came with a 2009 appearance on Dancing with the Stars

A jury in Austin had determined that DeLay conspired with two associates, John Colyandro and Jim Ellis, to use his Texas-based political action committee to send a check for $190,000 in corporate money to an arm of the Washington-based Republican National Committee. The RNC then sent the same amount to seven Texas House candidates. Under state law, corporate money cannot be given directly to political campaigns.

Prosecutors said the money helped the GOP take control of the Texas House, enabling them to push through a DeLay-engineered congressional redistricting plan that sent more Republicans to Congress in 2004, strengthening his political power.

But in a 22-page opinion, the appeals court said prosecutors “failed in its burden to prove that the funds that were delivered to the seven candidates were ever tainted.”Gregg Cox, the Travis County prosecutor whose office convicted DeLay, did not immediately return a phone message Thursday.
