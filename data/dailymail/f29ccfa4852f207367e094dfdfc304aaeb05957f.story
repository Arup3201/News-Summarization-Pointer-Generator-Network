Police looking for missing student Megan Roberts are using specialist sonar equipment to scan a river they believe she may have fallen into.

Miss Roberts, 20, has not been seen for more than a week since she disappeared during a night out with friends in York city centre.

North Yorkshire Police said earlier this week they believe the most likely explanation for her disappearance is that she got separated from her group while under the influence of alcohol and fell in the River Ouse near to York's Lendal Bridge.

River Ouse: More than 30 officers are searching the water around the Lendal Bridge where the student was last seen last Thursday

They are now using sonar equipment to search the river for the missing student

Concern: Officers have launched an urgent search after the disappearance of Megan Roberts, 20, last week

Divers: The Yorkshire search team have complained of 'really difficult conditions' with 'no visibility in 'fast flowing and very cold' water

Divers from the regional police underwater search unit have been searching the river since Miss Roberts, who is from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, was reported missing on Monday.

A spokesman said the team was now using special sonar equipment to scan the water from Lendal Bridge downstream to Naburn.

The operation has supported by firefighters using a boat.

The spokesman said: 'Over the weekend officers will conduct searches along the banks on both sides of the river.'

Megan was last seen on CCTV on the corner of Rougier Street and Lendal Bridge at around 2.20am on January 23.

A week after her disappearance, Superintendent Phil Cain said: 'The strongest and most probable line of inquiry being pursued by police is that Megan, affected by alcohol, has entered the river.'

Mr Cain stressed that there was ‘no evidence to indicate foul play’, adding ‘on balance, this presents as a group of young friends on a night out that is likely to have ended in tragedy’.

The officer said Miss Roberts was with a group of friends who had been drinking for 'several hours' before leaving the Popworld nightclub, in York city centre, at around 2.10am on Thursday morning.

Search: Police are hunting York for Megan Roberts who has been missing since last Thursday morning after a night out in the city with friends

Last sighting: At 2.10am CCTV footage shows Miss Roberts with a group of people on the corner of Rougier Street near Lendal Bridge, left. Ten minutes later they crossed to the other side, right, but Megan was gone

Mr Cain explained how the group were spread out and some of them ran down a street called Tanner's Moat, past The Maltings pub, where Miss Roberts - the last in the group - was spotted bumping into a row of cycle racks.

'CCTV evidence does not show Megan running back up the same street with the others to rejoin the main group,' he said.

Mr Cain said the group of friends has been extensively spoken to and officers are confident that none of them is directly responsible for Miss Roberts's disappearance.

Miss Roberts is described as around 5ft 6in and of medium build with long dark brown hair.

When last seen she was wearing a cream knee-length dress which had large brown and orange flowers on it and black plimsolls-type shoes.
