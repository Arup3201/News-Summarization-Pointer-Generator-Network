Why do lighthouses so fascinate people? Despite the fact that they are located on remote coastlines and are impractical to live in, a pack of prospective buyers queue up whenever one comes on the market.

This question is one that Robin Beckmann, 54, is in a good position to answer.

He is selling Point Lynas lighthouse on the north-east coast of Anglesey in North Wales, where he has lived with his wife Iona, 46, and their two adult children for 11 years.

‘There’s so much more to a lighthouse than a normal house,’ says Robin, who works in education administration.

‘There’s all the history that comes with it, and there’s an air of mystery and danger about being on a little bit of land confronting the sea.’

Robin’s own story of how he came to buy this lighthouse is a romantic one. It began in the 1980s when he and Iona would come to Anglesey on holidays.

‘We would walk by the headland and we’d always talk about what it would be like to live in the lighthouse – it was special to us,’ he recalls. ‘Then, in 2002, Iona saw it was for sale. We just had to have it.’

Financially, it seemed like a madcap idea. The lighthouse, which was on the market for £230,000, came with three keepers’ cottages but these dwellings were virtually falling down and they were not allowed to live in the lighthouse tower itself.

When Robin bought it, he had to lease it back to Trinity House and Mersey Docks and Harbour Board at a peppercorn rent so that they could maintain it.

The lighthouse is still in use. The 1,000-watt lamp shines for nine seconds out of every ten, 24 hours a day. Its beam can be seen for 18 nautical miles.

Robin spent £700,000 restoring the cottages, rented two of them out as holiday homes and lived in the third with his family.

All three cottages have three bedrooms. Robin charges £350 a week in the low season and £950 in high season for the two holiday homes. The lettings made a gross profit of £42,000 last year.

While other holiday cottages can be difficult to let out in winter, he found plenty of interest at this time of the year because holidaymakers are keen to witness the dramatic storms that lash this stretch of the coast around Christmas time. As a result, he found he was able to let out the cottages for 40 to 45 weeks of the year.

But Point Lynas has always been more than a simply an investment to Robin. Over the years he has become obsessed – ‘to the point of nerdiness’ – with everything to do with lighthouses. He has joined the Association of Lighthouse Keepers, an organisation of like-minded enthusiasts that runs visits to lighthouses around the country.

He has also researched Point Lynas’s history with academic diligence, finding the grave of its first keeper, a certain Captain Beaver, in the nearby Llaneilian churchyard.

It transpires that as a young man in the 1750s, Beaver was a pirate who caused havoc in the Caribbean. Robin has also made contact with the son of a former keeper and the wife of another. ‘The curious thing is that both of them often walk around this way,’ says Robin. ‘It’s as if the lighthouse continues to cast its spell over them.’

A number of lighthouses have gone on the market recently. Strathy Point and Tod Head, on the east coast of Scotland, sold for above their asking prices of £75,000 and £145,000 respectively.

And along the North Wales coast from Point Lynas, at Talacre Bay in Flintshire, the Point of Ayr Lighthouse found a buyer at £90,000. As the tower is cut off from land at high tide, the new owners will experience the thrill of waves breaking all around them. As a permanent dwelling, it is unusable, having no mains services.

Anyone looking for a more realistic buy-to-let opportunity might be interested in The Old Lighthouse at St Ann’s Head in Pembrokeshire. Currently used as two holiday lettings, its observation lounge in the former lens room gives fantastic views over the islands of Skomer and Skokholm. It is for sale for £975,000. Point Lynas’s price of £1.375 million is obviously going to put it beyond the budget of many people.

Would it be possible to buy the cottages individually?

‘I’d be reluctant to split them up because they are worth more as a single business than as separate cottages,’ says Robin, who is leaving to take up a new job in mid-Wales. ‘Also, there is a reason why there are three keepers’ cottages here.

‘In the 1800s there were two keepers at The Smalls lighthouse off West Wales and one of them died. The other tied the dead body in some tarpaulin and hung the corpse outside the window.

‘By the time the survivor was picked up, he had been driven raving mad and the authorities stipulated that every lighthouse in the country must be manned by three keepers.

‘To break up the three cottages would be going against this old lighthouse keepers’ code.’
