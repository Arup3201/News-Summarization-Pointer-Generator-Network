Forget trying to catch waves, this brave paddle boarder appeared to be hitching a ride on the back of a whale.  

Mark Jackson was floating just off shore near Kailua-Kona, in Hawaii, when the colossal creature emerged from the water just a few feet behind him.

Totally unaware of the massive mammal, Mr Jackson  continued to circle the bay in a leisurely fashion before the whale surfaced alongside him.

Mark Jackson appeared to be riding the whale just off the shore near Kailua-Kona in Hawaii

Mr Jackson had been unaware of the giant mammal in the water until it breached the surface just feet away

David Warren, pictured with his wife Sue, captured the images after spotting the strange encounter from his deck some 1200ft away, saying 'it looked like the boarder was surfing on the whale'

Even more surprised by the encounter was David Warren, who was watching it unfold from his deck, some 1200ft away, and was so amused by what he saw that he got out his camera.

Mr Warren, who was on holiday with his wife Sue from Scotland, even tracked down Mr Jackson who had been completely unaware of the giant mammal, which had its calf in tow.

The 65-year-old said: 'At first glance it looked as if the boarder was surfing on the whale.'

Mr Warren said he had noticed Mr Jackson paddling around the bay, where he and his wife had earlier seen whales breaching in the water, as he ate his breakfast.

He said: 'I then saw a whale swim past the boarder, who did not seem fazed at all, a cool dude obviously, and he then paddled back to shore.

 Mr Warren tracked down Mr Jackson who said there was two humpback whales in the water with him

Mr Jackson was said to have been 'amazed' at the images, completely unaware how it looked from the shore

'I tracked down the paddle boarder after he arrived back on shore. He said the whale got very close but even he was amazed at the picture.

'He says there were two humpback whales, probably a mother and juvenile. However, only one breached near him. 

'It was an amazing spectacle to witness.'
