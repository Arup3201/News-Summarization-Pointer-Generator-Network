Edwin van der Sar believes that Louis van Gaal and Ryan Giggs are the perfect match to take Manchester United forward from their dismal campaign.

The 43-year-old former goalkeeper, who made 266 appearances for the club in a six-year spell, told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek that Giggs can only improve working under the veteran Dutch manager.

'I'm sure under the guidance of Louis he [Giggs] can become an even better coach or manager in the future,' Van der Sar said.

Oranje: Louis van Gaal was Van der Sar's manager at Ajax and for the Netherlands

'Even when I played with him he was busy with his coaching badges and the philosophy of the club is in the right hands with him.

'Ryan is going to be there as assistant manager and that should be enough, with his experience, to bring United in a better frame than this year.'

As well as playing for Man Utd, Van der Sar also played under Louis van Gaal at Ajax in the mid-90s and during his first spell as Netherlands manager between 2000-02.

'The main thing is he has the pedigree,' Van der Sar said of his old boss.

'He's won trophies in Spain and he did an excellent job in Germany with Bayern Munich, that's also not an easy club to go to with all the powerful people that are there in the stands.

'He also has experience with the national team being at the World Cup so he has the respect of the players I presume.

'He likes attacking football, he's tactically very strong and he likes to prepare teams to the smallest detail.

'He has a very clear vision on how he wants to play and I think that's very important at United.

'I've been there six years and the way the supporters want Man Utd to play, I think that's very important to bring United back to the place where it belongs.'
