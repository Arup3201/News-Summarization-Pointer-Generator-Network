Charged: Jacob Daniel Drotning has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly setting light to his wife in May

A South Carolina man has been charged with attempted murder after police say he covered his wife in gasoline and set her on fire - causing third-degree burns to 70 percent of her body.

Emergency personnel responded to a call at 10:46 pm on May 16 to find Katie Drotning, 31, lying on the porch of her Seneca house severely injured and she told them that her husband, Jacob Drotning had attempted to kill her.

She told police she had not idea why he attempted to kill her but Drotning told deputies that it was an accident caused when he tried to start a barbecue by using gasoline.

Officers checked his grill and in said they were cool to the touch and had dew on them in their report.

Drotning also did not have any injuries himself that would be consistent with his story.

After an investigation that lasted almost a month, police charged Drotning on Thursday.

Katie Drotning's parents, who live in Hopkins, Minnesota, said their daughter was a victim of repeated domestic violence.

'I
 said if you guys are arguing.If there is anything you cannot handle if 
you need to get away even just for a little while come home. You can 
come home,' Katie's mom, Ruby Cook said on Wednesday to Kare11.

Inexplicable: Katie Drotning told police that she couldn't explain why her husband set her on fire and said it happened out of nowhere

Injuries: Katie Drotning suffered third-degree burns to 70 percent of her body and is in intensive care in South Carolina

Drotning has two son's from a previous relationship.

Katie is in acute-intensive care in South Carolina and will be for at least three months.

Last week she nearly lost her life to an infection and in the last three weeks she has had 15 surgeries.

Her sister Jennifer has created a fundraising website for anyone who would like to help out.
