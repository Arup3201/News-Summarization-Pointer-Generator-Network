Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich is reportedly addicted to alcohol and can’t get to sleep without having a drink.

A source told the Chicago Sun-Times the ex-politician drinks himself ‘into a condition’ to get some sleep but is not addicted to sleeping pills.

The claim comes as his lawyers asked to have him placed in a drug abuse programme when he starts his 14-year prison sentence for corruption.

Addicted to alcohol? A source told the Chicago Sun-Times former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich drinks himself 'into a condition' to get some sleep

Blagojevich and his lawyers have not publicly identified any problems with drug abuse in the three years since his arrest in December 2008.

The request could be a move to cut time off his sentence. Many criminals ask to join the drug rehab or other programmes, legal experts say.

His lawyers are trying to cut down his sentence, and if it turns out he has alcohol or drug problems then a rehab programme could reduce his term.

Prisoners in the programme generally live apart from other inmates, work fewer hours and are eligible for up to a year in reduced prison time.

Judge James Zagel will recommend him for the programme but federal prison officials get the final say on whether he can enter it.

Blagojevich faces 14 years in prison for corruption, including charges he tried to sell or trade the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama.

The disgraced politician was also convicted of trying to shake down hospital and racetrack executives and of lying to the FBI.

Judge Zagel agreed on Tuesday to recommend Blagojevich for the low-security Englewood prison in Littleton, Colorado, near Denver.

About 60 inmates out of about 800 are in the residential drug abuse programme. Blagojevich is scheduled to report to prison on March 15.
