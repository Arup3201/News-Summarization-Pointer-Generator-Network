Arturo Vidal scored twice as Juventus comfortably beat Cesena 3-0  to become the first team in Serie A history to win their opening four matches without conceding a goal.

Vidal, a Manchester United target in the summer, converted a controversial penalty in the 18th minute.

He then found the net from beyond the area in the 64th minute and Stephan Lichtsteiner added Juve’s third late on after a counter attack.

While not exactly routing opponents, with seven goals in four matches, Juventus’ defence has been superb even without injured center back Andrea Barzagli.

‘Vidal came back after a long time out and even if he wasn’t at his best he was decisive,’ Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said.

The three-time defending Italian champions are also yet to concede in Europe, having opened their Champions League campaign with a 2-0 win over Malmo.

Stephan Lichtsteiner added a third for the Italian giants to round off a comfortable evening 

‘I inherited a squad with great organization and the results have shown that,’ said Allegri, who replaced Antonio Conte in July.

‘Football matches are won with solid organization and great players - not tactics.’

Inter Milan beat Atalanta 2-0 at the San Siro with an impressive acrobatic goal in the 45th minute from on-loan Southampton striker Dani Osvaldo and a free kick that went in off the post from Hernanes in the 87th minute.

Osvaldo came on in the first half for Mauro Icardi, who limped off after a defender drove a knee into his right thigh.
