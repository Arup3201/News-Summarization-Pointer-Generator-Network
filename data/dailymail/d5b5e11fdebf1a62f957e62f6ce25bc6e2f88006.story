For those flying home for Thanksgiving today can expect around 17 per cent of flights to be delayed.

According to statistics averaged between 2005 and 2013, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving sees around 17 per cent of flights delayed, while those travelling on the Tuesday experience an average of 18 per cent of flights running behind schedule.

And the most problematic part of the journey is returning home, with up to a quarter of flights delayed on average on the Monday following the holiday weekend. 

The statistics were gathered by eBay after analyzing average flight delays over key holiday periods.

For those willing to travel on Thanksgiving itself, delays drop to around eight per cent on average with just six percent of airlines reporting delays on the Friday.

But passengers travelling at Christmas can expect further hold-ups.

The infographic, created by eBay, shows that the worst time to travel during the Christmas break is on December 22, when an average of 37 per cent of flights have experienced delays over the past eight years.

The peak time for delays on flights is between December 20 and 23, while Christmas Day sees them drop to an average of 20 per cent.

If you are about to fly home for Thanksgiving, you would do well to steer clear of American Airlines and United, which appear  the highest average numbers of delays, according to the infographic.

And America, Delta and JetBlue seem to experience the greatest delays over the Christmas period.
