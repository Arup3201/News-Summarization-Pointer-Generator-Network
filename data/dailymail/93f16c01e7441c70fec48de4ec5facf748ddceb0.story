A taxi industry trade newspaper has threatened to out five 'secretly gay' Chicago City Council officials unless they ban smartphone ride-sharing services which it says are threatening drivers' jobs.

Publisher of The Chicago Dispatcher, George Lutfallah, said the industry was under siege and, in an editorial in his latest issue, set out a list of 10 demands.

Mr Lutfallah said his trade publication 'has learned 
that five of the city’s 50 aldermen are closeted homosexuals. In the 
next issue of this newspaper, set to be published early next month, we 
will disclose their names unless our demands are met'.

'The
 city is moving forward and will steamroll our industry if we don’t act 
in earnest,' he said.

'They did it to my grandfather more than 100 years ago 
when they destroyed his horse-drawn-carriage business by allowing 
horseless machines to carry people around the city.

'The five aldermen we will expose next 
month will only include those who have concealed their gay lifestyle to 
their constituents.

'They are public servants who have a duty to 
truthfully disclose their sexuality to the voters. They are living a 
lie.'

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's moves to change the city's taxi industry are proving unpopular

He added that if the city does allow ride-sharing - when fares are booked using apps such as Uber, Lyft and SideCar - cars would require GPS
 tracking 'so that our 
informant can keep telling us when Aldermen are taken from their homes 
and dropped off in Boys Town'.

Bizarrely, Mr Lutfallah also urged the city to ban the internet and rename the landmark Willis Tower the Sears Tower, prompting suspicion his threat may not be serious, according to CBS Chicago.

He said ride-share drivers should be 
required to get annual chest X-rays, 'like the city-endorsed doctor had 
me do to renew my chauffeur’s license last month. The riding public has 
no idea if ride-share drivers have tuberculosis'.

Also on Mr Lutfallah's hitlist were female ride-share taxi drivers, who he said should not be allowed behind the wheel.

'One company boasts that 40 percent of 
its drivers are women. Taxi driving is a male-dominated profession and 
it should remain that way,' he said.

'The last place for a woman is behind the 
wheel. If a woman needs a ride somewhere, she will only feel safe if the
 driver is a man.'

The controversial editorial comes as aldermen 
consider a move by Mayor Rahm Emanuel to impose new regulations on ride-sharing companies including insisting they have insurance, pay a 
$25,000-a-year fee and pay a $3.50-per-day-per-vehicle tax.

Regular cab 
companies argue those fees are insignificant compared to the $350,000 cost of simply getting a licence.

They have previously sued the city over the lack of regulations for ride-sharing
 companies, noting they can operate vehicles that are 
not accessible to the disabled.

Bernard Cherkasov, CEO for Equality 
Illinois, condemned what he 
called an 'outrageous attempt to blackmail the city of Chicago and 
scornfully humiliate members of the Chicago City Council'.

'However
 this article was intended, it is no joking matter. We call on the 
publication to immediately retract its extremely offensive article and 
apologize to the city’s LGBT community, women drivers and customers, the
 City Council and the public at large.

The
 Illinois Transportation Trade Association, which represents cab 
companies and taxi medallion holders, said: 'The 
ITTA and our affiliated taxi companies unequivocally condemn the piece 
that ran in today’s Chicago Dispatcher and the hateful message it sends.

'This misguided attempt at parody has no place in this discussion and 
demonstrates an extreme lack of judgment or sensitivity.'
