She might be a no-nonsense countrywoman but even the Duchess of Cornwall couldn't resist a grimace when handed a plasticised dog heart during a visit to a London vet.

The heart, which did come from a real animal, had been preserved with chemicals and was being used as a teaching aid by professors at the Beaumont Sainsbury Animal Hospital.

Luckily for pet-loving Camilla, the visit wasn't all animal parts and surgery, with the Duchess breaking into a smile after finding some living animals to pet.

Ugh! The Duchess looks aghast after being handed a plasticised dog heart to hold

One of them was a lurcher named Dogmatix, who thumped his tail hopefully as the Duchess approached.

She immediately obliged, with the dog, who was at the hospital for a routine examination, looking beseechingly up at Camilla while she patted him.

Another pet waiting in the consulting room was Jessica, a fluffy feline whose less-than-impressed expression was enough to rival Grumpy Cat's.

Owned by the Fluin family, the cat spent the royal visit staring moodily at the table and refused to engage with either nurses or Duchess.

Camilla, who was elegant in a blue cashmere suit by couturier Roy Allen, had more luck with a bearded dragon named Nugget, which was happy to be petted by the Duchess.

Gruesome: The heart, which is a real one, is used as a teaching aid by professors at the veterinary hospital

Much better: The Duchess looked far happier when meeting Dogmatix, a lurcher in for a check-up

Quick pat: The Duchess, a dog owner herself, gave the grizzled pet a pat

And one for you too! A bearded dragon named Nugget also got a quick scratch from the Duchess

Not amused: Jessica the cat, perhaps disliking being at the vets, looked grumpy throughout

Cross: The pet remained unmoved by the royal visit, despite Camilla's best efforts

Having toured the wards, Camilla ventured into the teaching part of the hospital where she encountered a familiar face - a horse named Foxhunter which had been through the same plasticisation process as the dog heart.

'I do remember seeing him jump many years ago!' said the Duchess of the horse, which was part of Britain's show jumping team at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

Foxhunter, a 16.3hh golden bay gelding, took bronze during that event and went on to amass several more medals before dying in 1959.

Camilla's visit to the Beaumont Salisbury Animal Hospital came as part of her work with the Animal Care Trust, of which she has been patron since 2005.

Hello there: The Duchess peered into one of the clinic cages for a better look at a sick iguana

Shy: Rather than face the cameras, one ginger cat chose to hide behind its blanket instead

Model student: Jess Mullard showed the Duchess a horse head she had made from cloth

Enjoying herself: Camilla chatted to student Jade Johnson during a reception at the end of the visit

The ACT is the Royal Veterinary College’s  registered charity and it raises funds to support research into improving veterinary treatment and training budding medics.

Speaking after the visit, Professor Stuart Reid, principal of the Royal Veterinary College, said: 'The generous donations to the ACT are invaluable in helping us to deliver the best possible care to our patients and world-leading veterinary education to our students. 

'We were delighted to welcome The Duchess of Cornwall to our teaching hospital in Camden so that she could see just how much of an impact these donations have on the work that we do.'

Meanwhile... Prince Edward survives a security scare in Belfast

Unscathed: Prince Edward had a security scare during a visit to the Titanic Belfast but emerged unscathed

Moving on: As a result, he was able to carry on to the Belfast Royal Academy to present some awards

Scheme: He was presenting Duke of Edinburgh gold award winners with their certificates

The Duchess of Cornwall isn't the only royal who has been busy this week, with Prince Edward spending the last two days in Belfast.

Edward was there to present certificates to local students on behalf of the Duke of Edinburgh Awards scheme but also fell victim to a security alert.

The scare came as the result of the presence of a mysterious package outside the Titanic Belfast, which he was touring at the time.

Happily, police fears proved unfounded and Edward was able to continue on to his next engagement at the Belfast Royal Academy.
