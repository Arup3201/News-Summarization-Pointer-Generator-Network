Charlotte Ponce has been dreaming of putting on a pair of earrings for most of her young life - and now she can finally fulfill her wish.   

The 12-year-old Michigan girl, whose face was mauled by a pet raccoon when she was a baby, is celebrating the completion of two years' worth of reconstructive surgical procedures.

Since August 2012, she has had her upper lip repaired, her nose rebuilt and been given a new right ear. She underwent skin graft surgery last week on the arm where her ear was harvested.

Dream come true: Charlotte Ponce, 12, can now finally wear earrings following a reconstructive surgery to rebuild her right ear (right) mauled by a raccoon more than a decade ago 

Work in progress: Charlotte will require a few follow-up operations to give her ear (pictured) more definition

Treasure chest: People from around the country have been sending the 12-year-old earrings for her to wear after her final major surgery 

'I can finally wear earrings,' Charlotte said from her hospital bed in suburban Detroit. 

On Monday, Charlotte, her adoptive parents and the surgeon looked back on her journey.

'I kept my word. I told her we'd give her nose back, lip back and ear back, and so we did,' Dr. Kongkrit Chaiyasate, Charlotte's surgeon, told WXYZ-TV.

On April 15, surgeons at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan spent seven hours embedding rib cartilage, shaped into an ear lobe, into Charlotte's arm where it grew for months.Before the complex procedure, which has only been performed twice before, Dr Chiayasate said he practiced on a potato.

He told WBIV: 'As plastic surgeons we need to think outside the box a little bit - what can we do to make a life long reconstruction for her. 'I've been practicing carving potato last weekend using this as a template. It's not easy.'

Charlotte has undergone at least 10 operations since 2012 to restore her face. She previously had a prosthetic ear fitted but it was not an ideal solution and soon became infected and uncomfortable.

The girl was just an infant in 2002 when the family's pet raccoon climbed into her crib while her biological 18-year-old mother and 23-year-old father left her home alone with the animal in the western Michigan community of Ravenna.

New family: Charlotte has been living (from left) with her great-uncle Tim, great-aunt Sharon and brother Marshall, ever since her parents lost custody of her

Long time coming: Charlotte lived for a decade without a reconstructed nose, lips and right ear

High hopes: Charlotte is excited to go back to swimming, playing soccer and gymnastics 

 

The raccoon was thought to have escaped from its cage after a door was left open when food had been dropped in, and no one was there to save the baby when she was attacked. 

Charlotte's parents were charged with owning a dangerous animal that caused serious injury and were placed on probation.

In 2005, the state terminated Charlotte's biological parents' parental rights. After that, Charlotte and her older brother Marshall were adopted by Sharon and Tim Ponce, their great-aunt and great-uncle.

The Ponces believe the raccoon, which later was put down, was after Charlotte's bottle.

Charlotte will require a few follow-up operations to give her ear more definition. But now that the big reconstructive surgeries are behind her, she is ready to get back to playing soccer, swimming and doing gymnastics — and this worries Tim Ponce.

'Dad's afraid I'm going to break my neck one of these days while doing gymnastics,' Charlotte said.

As for adorning her brand-new ear, Chaiyasate supplied his patient with a short-term fix.

During last week's procedure, the doctor surprised Charlotte by piercing her new ear and fashioning a makeshift earring from IV tubing.

Revolutionary: The rib cartilage was molded into the shape of an ear and inserted into Charlotte's arm during the April 15 surgery

What a change: Before the surgery, the little girl only had a hole where her right ear was supposed to be 

Almost there: Beaumont Health Systems posted this photo on Twitter last month with the caption, 'Charlotte is doing well as Dr. Chaiyasate transfers the molded ear from her arm to her head'

But the 12-year-old girl won't have to wear the plastic tube for long: well-wishers from across the country have overwhelmed the Ponce family with dozens of earrings for the girl to wear, as well as hundreds of 'get well' cards. 

'I have enough to last, like, 20 years,' the budding fashionista boasted to Fox 17 about her growing collection of accessories.

Beyond the trinkets, Charlotte said she has a bucket list that includes a few serious goals, chief among them 'get married, then have an only child.'
