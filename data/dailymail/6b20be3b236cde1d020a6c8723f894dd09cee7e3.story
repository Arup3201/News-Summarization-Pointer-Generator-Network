While Kristen Stewart and her married
 director paramour Rupert Sanders have both issued grovelling apologies 
for their exposed affair, Robert Pattinson has remained resolutely silent.

Even the cuckolded wife, British 
model Liberty Ross, has taken a few swipes via cryptic Twitter postings, 
but sources close to Robert, 26, say the actor is too devastated to yet 
formulate a response.

Paradise lost: Kristen Stewart, 22, cheated on Robert Pattinson with married director Rupert Sanders, 41 - but you would never have guessed from her demeanour on Sunday at the Teen Choice Awards

Married man: Rupert can be seen with his wedding ring at a Snow White screening in Los Angeles in May

In fact, they say that the Twilight star is still in 'shock' after learning about his partner's transgression.

'Rob is in shock that Kristen cheated on him, he is absolutely devastated,' a source close to the actor told RadarOnline.com.

'But right now he doesn’t want to say anything in public until he figures out what he’s going to do.'

'Rob is really hurt by Kristen,' the source added. 'Catching her cheating is not at all what he expected from her.'

Kristen and Rob were out together
 just three days ago on July 22 at the Teen Choice Awards were they 
seemed happy and in love.

Just two nights earlier they had held hands as they arrived at a Hollywood bar to catch a gig. 

But that previous Tuesday, July 17, unbeknownst to Stewart, she'd been photographed in an embrace with the married father-of-two at a deserted beauty spot.

The actor made his feelings regarding
 infidelity clear in April, telling Vanity Fair: 'There's a thing I've 
never got: That is, why do people cheat?'

He explained that while he 'can 
understand the impulse' to cheat, he doesn't comprehend 'how you can 
keep two relationships going at the same time for long.'

'I'm not the casual-affair kind of 
guy,' he said. 'If I choose to be with someone, it's because I really 
want it. When I have a relationship, I'm 100 percent into it.'

Before the drama: Liberty was seen posing up with Kristen, as well as Charlize Theron and Lily Cole, at the London premiere of the movie last month

Kristen said in her apology statement: 'I love [Rob], I’m so sorry.'

She certainly looked to be in love with the hearthrob when she appeared with him at the Comic Con convention in San Diego the weekend before, but it remains to see if Rob will find her sincere. 

Meanwhile, the young heartthrobs new movie The Rover has been given the green light by Screen Australia, according to The Hollywood Reporter!

Set in the Australian desert, The Rover is a futuristic western that 'tells the story of Eric (Guy Pearce), who has left everything, everyone and every semblance of human kindness behind him, as he’s forced to join an injured gang member, Rey (Pattinson), to hunt down Rey’s gang after they steal the last of Eric’s possessions.'
