There aren’t many coaches whose team barely musters a noticeable support for home games and has the measly total of only five home goals all season — whose predecessor was just ‘sold’ for €4million to a Chinese team — who is sufficiently confident the day before facing the reigning European champions to claim: ‘I really don’t think I’m far off coaching Real Madrid’. 

But the fact is that Quique Sanchez Flores is a bit special. A quality which will need to be flooding out of him like a river in spate if the beleaguered mob he’s just taken charge of, Getafe, are not to feel the whiplash of a displeased Madrid side facing their third derby match in less than a fortnight. 

Perhaps, if your memory is elephantine, you may recall Quique for his Getafe side beating the Galáctico Real Madrid of Iker Casillas, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane and Michael Owen just short of 10 years ago during his previous single season in charge of this club. Much more likely is that you know Quique for having seeded the Atletico Madrid revolution.

Goalkeeper David de Gea was given his big break at Atletico Madrid by Quique Sanchez Flores

He gave Diego Costa his debut, was brave enough to establish 19-year-old David de Gea as first-choice keeper, won the Europa League in 2010, knocking out Sporting, Valencia, Liverpool and then beating Fulham in the final — plus his Rojiblancos then defeated treble-holders Inter Milan for the European Supercup. 

It ended in tears. Doesn’t it always? 

But notwithstanding Diego Simeone’s brilliance, the Argentinian largely inherited a ‘made’ squad when he succeeded Quique three years ago. So, the 49-year-old carries a bit of Madrileño football baggage into this lunchtime’s derby match at the Alfonso Pérez Coliseum (Sky Sports 5, 10.55am). 

But the fact is that he’s actually a minor royal in the Real Madrid dynasty. 

To explain. Quique’s father (Isidro) was a quadruple Spanish title-winner with the almighty Real of di Stéfano, Gento, Puskas and del Sol. Quique’s mother (Carmen) and aunt (‘Lola of Spain’) were both massively famous singers, flamenco dancers and movie stars.

 And as far as children of the 1960’s go, there could barely be a better Godfather than Don Alfredo di Stéfano — the legendary Blond Arrow himself. Quique’s cousins all became famous in music, television or cinema, such that the family Sanchez/Flores must, at times, have felt that ‘Spain belongs to us ... Spain loves us’. Little wonder that Quique isn’t short of some natural assurance. His stock is both gypsy, and thoroughbred — his life has been spent in the elite. Not spent without trials and tribulations however.

Just as he was performing well enough as a full-back to be picked for Spain [he went to Italia ’90] Atlético tried to sign him from Valencia — coached by none other than di Stéfano. Things went a bit Pete Tong as di Stéfano warned Valencia he’d quit if they sold the boy. 

It became a national cause célèbre as Quique’s mother Carmen put in a two-footed, studs-up challenge — demanding to her husband’s best pal, di Stéfano, that her son should be allowed to better himself (and return to the family home in Spain’s capital). 

‘That row over Atlético trying to sign me really stunned me,’ Quique revealed years later. ‘My mother got involved in the furore because I wasn’t around and she felt someone had to say something. Because she’s so famous, it had more repercussions. I felt embarrassed.

‘I try to dodge the celebrity magazines which are meat and drink to the rest of my family.’ 

Then, when Quique won his only trophy as Madrid’s starting right-back, it was blemished with family tragedy.

It was 20 years ago and Real were about to break Barcelona’s ‘Dream Team’ run of four straight championships under Johan Cruyff. Just at that theoretically sweet moment his aunt, Lola, died of cancer.

Massive parts of the nation just adored her, so Spain had barely finished mourning, 15 days later, when her son Antonio (Quique’s cousin) was found dead at home from a drug and alcohol overdose. 

The Spanish title which Madrid and Quique lifted the following week was a sombre triumph for him. 

Perhaps being pitted against the biggest club of his career at this stage is too soon to expect a win. But if he really expects to coach Real in the near future, then what better way to attract their attention?
