Bernie Ecclestone has said that Qatar’s extravagant plans to host a Formula One grand prix could be thwarted by a handshake deal he did with the country’s Middle Eastern neighbours, Bahrain.

Despite Qatar unveiling images of a proposed new street circuit in Lusail, the city that has been named as the venue for the final of the 2022 football World Cup, Ecclestone said: ‘There is a problem.

‘When I did the deal to have a race in Bahrain I shook hands with them – promising not to have another race in the area unless they agreed to it.

Bernie Ecclestone has revealed that Qatar's plans to host a Formula One race may never get off the ground 

‘Then Abu Dhabi came along and said they wanted a race. I said I couldn’t help them unless Bahrain agree to let them join the calendar. If they agreed, fine. They did agree.

‘Now Bahrain needs to agree to a race in Qatar. If that can be sorted, fine. If not, we can’t do anything about it.’

Qatar’s plans has the support of the Emir, Sheikh Tamim Ben Hamad Al Thani, and their ambitions are underlined by plans for an all-new circuit in preference to using the Losail circuit that has staged Moto GP for the past decade.

Qatar hope to run an F1 race in 2016, and failing that in 2017. They have built good links with the FIA over the last few years as shown when the sport’s official end-of-season gala awards dinner was staged there last month.

But Bahrain have indicated that they are not keen to acquiesce to Qatar’s proposed entry. ’My personal opinion of having another race – wherever it is – I don’t think we are ready for that,’ said Bahrain’s F1 chief executive Sheikh Salman bin Isa Al Khalifa.
