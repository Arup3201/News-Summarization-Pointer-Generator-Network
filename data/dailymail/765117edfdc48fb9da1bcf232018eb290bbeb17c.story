The Colombian women's cycling team were meant to be showing the world what they were made of as they posed in their new kit this week.

But they appeared to show a little too much as all eyes were drawn to the bizarre new flesh-coloured design stretching across their lower torso.

As the smiling athletes took to the stage, they seemed blissfully unaware of the blunder, which left them looking completely exposed at the groin.

Strip-tease:  Colombian women's cycling team proudly pose in their startling new kit design in Italy this week

The Colombian team, which is sponsored by the country's capital city of Bogota, was wearing the outfit to take part in a cycling competition in Italy.

The race is held in honour of former Italian champion, Michela Fanini, whose promising career was cut short when she died in a car crash in 1994 at just 21 years old..

It is difficult to ascertain whether the outrageous new strip was a publicity stunt or a genuine fashion faux-pas but the team may think twice about turning out in it again. 

The design has caused a stir on social media - with many ranking it among the worst kits ever seen at a sporting event.

Some joked on Twitter that they had gone out to buy the kit, while others criticised the stunt for going too far.

Comparisons were also made with other sporting fashion mishaps- such as the Scottish team's kit at this summer's Commonwealth Games which involved a strange tartan and blue spotted design.

The Footon Servetto Fuji Tour de France 2010 squad had a similarly embarrassing moment when they revealed their kit - complete with a ridiculous bulging groin
