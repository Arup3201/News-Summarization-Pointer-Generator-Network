Deals: Lucy Adams, the BBC's Human Resources chief, approved all agreements over £75,000, including a £680,400 payment to former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson

BBC executives who authorised severance payments of £369million to their own staff may be investigated by the police, an MP warned last night.

As corporation bosses insisted there was no need for a ‘witch-hunt’, pressure grew on those responsible for the debacle to face internal disciplinary action and to meet the full force of the law if any of the deals proved to be fraudulent.

There were also calls for executives to ‘name and shame’ those who received excessive payments but have refused to return them.

In a report published on Monday, the National Audit Office found payouts were made to 7,500 staff over eight years, including £61million to 401 senior managers.

It said the corporation had paid staff more than they were entitled to in almost a quarter of the cases it reviewed, putting ‘public trust at risk’.

Yesterday, it emerged that many of the payments were signed off by the BBC’s head of human resources, Lucy Adams.

According to senior insiders she had a ‘blank cheque book’, allowing her to authorise a £680,400 farewell payment to former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson and a £949,000 payment to former deputy director-general Mark Byford.

MPs on the influential Public Accounts Committee called for ‘full accountability’ yesterday, and castigated the ‘greedy and excessive payments’ paid by a ‘self-serving elite’ at the head of the BBC.

It came as:

Mark Thompson: Personally approved some of the most controversial payments

LUCY ADAMS

Criticism: New director general Tony Hall admitted the BBC had 'lost its way' with big money pay-offs for senior staff

Criticism: Tory MP Rob Wilson accused the BBC of being 'secretive and evasive'

Writing to the NAO’s head, Amyas Morse, 
Mr Wilson asked whether it had unearthed any evidence of fraud, 
collusion in fraud, misuse of public funds, or other wrongdoing’.

He said: ‘In the event that you 
consider that criminal offences may have taken place, I would be 
grateful if you would inform me whether the evidence is sufficient to 
warrant a wider investigation as to the possibility of fraud, misuse of 
public funds, or other wrongdoing in relation to severance payments at 
the BBC in recent years.’

He added: ‘Based on the reply I 
receive, I will consider whether there are grounds to refer this matter 
to the police.’

But the BBC’s newly appointed director of news and 
current affairs, James Harding, yesterday claimed licence fee payers did
 not want the corporation to be ‘apologetic’.

The former Times editor said: ‘The BBC
 has rightly made its fair share of apologies over the past year. I, 
both as a licence-fee payer and a future employee don’t want an 
apologetic BBC, I want an ambitious BBC. You don’t want to be apologetic
 about the BBC, you want to be ambitious about the BBC, that’s the 
essential choice.’

Out: George Entwistle received  £475,000 after just 54 days as Director General, double what his contract stipulated

The BBC's incompetent use of public 
money was revealed after it emerged one ex-boss had given his vast 
pay-off back 'out of principle'.

Roly
 Keating was handed £375,000 to leave as director of archive content, 
despite his post not being made redundant and him having another job to 
go to.

He was awarded a 'termination payment' of £250,000 and six months’ pay in lieu of notice of £125,000.

He
 told BBC chiefs he was considering a new job as chief executive at the 
British Library, a post he now holds with a salary of around £140,000.

But
 after learning the decision to award the money was described as 
'seriously deficient' by the National Audit Office, he has returned the 
money.

Mr Keating wrote a 
letter to director-general Tony Hall and enclosed a cheque saying he 
wanted to give it back 'as a matter of principle'.

The
 BBC agreed to pay the money 'on the grounds that it believed the 
individual would not otherwise have accepted the job offer, which had a 
lower salary', according to today’s report.

In
 his letter Mr Keating said of the compromise agreement: 'I entered into
 and signed this agreement in the belief that the BBC had proposed it in
 good faith and for good reasons, and that it had been properly 
sanctioned and authorised.'

The BBC’s director of strategy and 
digital, James Purnell, is the only member of the corporation’s 
executive committee to give an interview on severance payments since the
 NAO report was published.

Appearing on BBC2’s Newsnight on 
Monday, the former Labour minister resisted calls to point the finger of
 blame at individuals responsible for agreeing the payments.

He said: ‘It was a collective 
decision. On things like this you can have a witch-hunt or you can learn
 from your mistakes and that is exactly what we are going to do.’

Pressed by presenter Jeremy Paxman, he
 said one particularly contentious deal had been ‘signed off by a 
combination of HR, finance and, er, they got it wrong’. He added: 
‘There’s no glossing over the fact they got it wrong. It was a mess.’

But yesterday, Tory MP Richard Bacon, 
who sits on the public accounts committee, said: ‘What we have found is 
that you need to find out exactly who is responsible. Unless and until 
people are named you will not get accountability.’

He added: ‘At the top of the BBC there
 is a self-serving elite who just look after themselves. These payments 
were greedy and excessive.’

The NAO report revealed that the BBC 
still plans to make 15 further severance payments of more than £150,000,
 even though Lord Hall promised to scrap such deals in April. Mr Purnell
 said it would be illegal to unpick them because those involved had been
 sent letters setting out their severance terms.

But the committee’s chairman, Labour 
MP Margaret Hodge, urged Lord Hall to scrap the deals, saying: ‘He needs
 to be very firm. He cannot back down on these payments.’

She promised her committee would probe
 the issue further in a special hearing next Wednesday, which will hear 
evidence from Lord Hall, human resources chief Miss Adams, BBC Trust 
chairman Lord Patten and the Trust’s finance director, Anthony Fry.

The NAO said yesterday that it had not
 found any evidence of illegality during its investigation of senior 
managers’ severance deals.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The NAO report 
found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing and we strongly refute any 
claims to the contrary.’
