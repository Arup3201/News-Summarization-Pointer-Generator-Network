Ashley Sulla, 18, said she has been in a relationship with Brenna Machus since April and that they lived together at a home in Romulus.

Sulla said she last spoke to Machus, whom she said she has known since childhood, before 7 p.m. Monday. When Sulla came home about 1 a.m. and saw Machus wasn’t there, she said she assumed Machus had gone to her mother’s house.

'I hope she’s fine,' Sulla said. 'I wonder what’s going through her mind.'

Ryan Machus described his sister as a smart, social butterfly with aspirations of becoming a crime-scene investigator.

'Brenna is one of the sweetest, most caring people that you would meet,' he said. 'She makes friends with anyone.'

He said his family is still hopeful she will be found safe, but his biggest fear is that she won’t be.

'You know, we’re not naïve,' Ryan Machus said. 'That’s why, you know, we’re trying to get as much out as we can as soon as possible.'
