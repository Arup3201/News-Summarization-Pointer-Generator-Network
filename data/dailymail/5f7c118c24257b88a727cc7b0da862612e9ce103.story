Wales prop Rob Evans has extended his contract at Scarlets, three days after making his first international start.

Evans has made 19 appearances for the Scarlets this season and was rewarded with his first Wales start in the 61-20 Six Nations win over Italy on Saturday.

The length of Evans' contract is not known but the 22-year-old said he is delighted to have committed his future to the club.

'It's a fantastic opportunity for me to continue my development with the Scarlets and I'm pleased to have signed a new deal to stay with the region,' Evans told Scarlets' official website.

'I've grown up supporting the Scarlets and am really enjoying my rugby with the region at the moment.

'I'm looking forward to finishing what has been a great season so far, for me personally, on a high helping the Scarlets secure our place in the top six and next season's top flight of European rugby.'

Evans, in action for the Scarlets, takes on Saracens centre Nick Tomkins at Allianz Park in November 

Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac added: 'We are pleased to announce that Rob has extended his contract with us here at the Scarlets.

'He has made great strides this season and will undoubtedly have developed further having had a little international experience and coming up against some of the world's best props during this season's European Rugby Champions Cup campaign.

'We are developing strength in depth at front row with a good crop of home-grown talent that will continue to develop together over the coming seasons ensuring a bright future for region.'
