One of Britain's most historic country mansions has gone on the market for a bargain £2.5 million.

With its own minstrels' gallery, 18th century classical library and vast Italianate gardens, Apethorpe Hall has all the trappings of a palace fit for a king.

But there is just one thing missing that no monarch could live without ... a throne of porcelain and a bath to match.

The princely pile, near Oundle, Northamptonshire,  has no bathroom and carries a £100,000-a-year maintenance bill.

Conditions of sale stipulate that the new owner must also keep the hall open to the public for at least 28 days a year.

The 48-room house is being sold by English Heritage after it bought it for £3 million eight years ago.

The Long Gallery: Originally built in 1470-80 by Sir Guy Wolston, it then sold to Sir Walter Mildmay and stayed in his family for 350 years

The great hall: Ravaged by years of neglect with dry rot its only permanent resident, the Government spent over £4 million on pulling it back from the brink of ruin

Ravaged by years of neglect with dry rot its only permanent resident, the Government spent over £4 million on pulling it back from the brink of ruin.

The house was developed as the focal point and power base of leading Tudor and Jacobean families, closely involved with the Court of England's ruling monarchs for over 150 years from Edward IV to Charles I.

Courtyard from the south: Experts estimate another £4 million is still needed to restore it to its full former glory

Originally built in 1470-80 by Sir Guy Wolston, who served as constable of the nearby royal castle at Fotheringhay, Esquire of the Body to Edward IV, and sheriff as well as MP for Northamptonshire.

It then sold to Sir Walter Mildmay, an English statesman who would serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Queen Elizabeth I. It stayed in his family for 350 years.

From the windows on the east side of the hall, it is said that Mildmay watched the arrival of the Queen. Apethorpe was one of the Queen's favourite overnight stops on the Great North Road.

Apethorpe was one of the Queen's favourite overnight stops on the Great North Road.

It was also a favourite haunt of monarchs James and Charles I who enjoyed magnificent feasts of venison and wine.

James I himself is believed to have enjoyed homosexual trysts when he visited the home 10 times between 1614 and 1624.

The restoration work uncovered a secret doorway leading from the king's bedchamber to the bedroom used by his 'sweetheart' and favourite courtier George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham.

It was at Apethorpe Hall that the pair are thought to have met for the first time.

Once described as Britain's most neglected Grade I country house, the hall's more recent owners include the Catholic Church - which used it as a school - and a millionaire Libyan who fled the UK following the shooting of WPc Yvonne Fletcher.

Once described as Britain's most neglected Grade I country house, the hall's more recent owners include the Catholic Church - which used it as a school - and millionaire Libyan Wanis Mohammed Burweila.

After the shooting of WPc Yvonne Fletcher during the Libyan Embassy siege in 1984 Mr Burweila was among the many Libyans who fled the UK.

He had been negotiating to sell the property to a consortium led by Harold Winton, the honorary life president of Queen's Park Rangers football club, which reportedly bought the property for £1.35 million.

But two days later, on account of its dilapidation, the Department of Culture Media and Sport served the compulsory purchase order and took it off their hands.

After years of wrangling and a lands tribunal, the Government was eventually forced to pay £3.18 million for the house.

The house has been used for filming scenes of various television historical dramas as well as the 1984 film Another Country, starring Rupert Everett and Colin Firth.

The latest sale has sparked anger amongst campaigners who have accused the Government of wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers money by selling the house at a huge discount on what it originally paid for it.

Emma Boon, Campaign Director of the Tax Payers’ Alliance said: 'It’s devastating that taxpayers have ended up paying millions only to see the property go back into private hands.

'This shows that Apethorpe should have been left to be restored properly by the property developer it was bought from in the first place. We all want to see historic buildings like this preserved as far as possible within reason,but this sorry saga means a huge loss to taxpayers at a time when the country can least afford it.'

A spokesman for English Heritage said: 'Following many years of neglect and decay, Apethorpe Hall had fallen into a state of significant disrepair and was in danger of being lost forever. As the government’s protector of England’s unique legacy of historic buildings, it was crucial that English Heritage took action to save Apethorpe Hall before it was too late.

'Following service by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport of a full Repairs Notice in 2001 and a Compulsory Purchase Order in 2002, English Heritage took over the property in September 2004 and subsequently carried out a programme of major repairs.
