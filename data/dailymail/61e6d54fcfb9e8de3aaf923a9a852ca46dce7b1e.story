A New York police officer accused of stopping and frisking, then arresting a black man because of his race is being held in protective custody and fears for his family's safety.

Michael Daragjati, 32, searched the man in April on Staten Island without proper cause before arresting him, according to a criminal complaint.

During a brief appearance in Brooklyn Federal Court yesterday to adjourn a bail hearing while he finds a new lawyer, his father Loro Daragjati expressed his support for his son.

Charges: Michael Daragjati, 32, allegedly stopped and frisked a black man in April on Staten Island without proper cause before arresting him. He is being held in protective custody and fears for his family's safety

He told reporters outside the hearing: 'He's my son and I love him.'

Daragjati's lawyer Michael Martinez revealed that his client is concerned for his family's safety.

Daragjati, who is white, allegedly arrested the man when he complained - and filed a false report saying he had resisted arrest.

Federal authorities say they later 
intercepted a phone call between Daragjati and a friend, when he allegedly said: 
‘Another n****r fried, no big deal’.

Daragjati is charged with violating 
the man’s civil rights - and with extortion as well as wire fraud in 
incidents relating to an off-duty snowplough business..

If convicted of all charges he could be jailed for up to 60 years and face a fine of up to $850,000.

The man complained about his treatment by the officer and was at first allowed to walk away, reported the New York Daily News.

But the man allegedly shouted insults at Daragjati, which prompted him to cross the street and handcuff him.

‘The power to arrest (must) be used fairly, responsibly and without bias,’ Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said.

‘Motivated by racial animosity, the defendant allegedly abused this power and responsibility.’

Daragjati has served with the NYPD for eight years.

The man was kept in jail for around 36 hours before being released.
