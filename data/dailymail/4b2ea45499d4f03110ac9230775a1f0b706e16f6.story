President Obama today presented 24 Medals of Honor to commemorate acts of bravery by servicemen - most of whom were previously overlooked because they were Hispanic, Jewish or African-American.

'Today we have the chance to set the record straight,' the president said at the rare ceremony at the White House on Tuesday.

The 24 recipients span three wars - from World War II to Korea to Vietnam - and just three of the veterans are still alive.

The two dozen servicemen were 
identified following a congressionally mandated review to ensure that 
recipients of the country's highest recognition for valor were not 
bypassed due to prejudice.

Obama said that a Medal of Honor ceremony 'is always a special occasion, ut today it is truly historic.'

'This ceremony reminds us of one of the enduring qualities that makes America great, that makes us exceptional,' he said.

'No nation is perfect. But here in America, we confront our imperfections and face a sometimes painful past, including the truth that some of these soldiers fought and died for a country that did not always see them as equal.'

Eight of the men fought in the Vietnam War, nine in the Korean War and seven in World War II.

The three living veterans all attended the ceremony on Tuesday, where they were greeted and applauded by President Obama.

Celebrated: Master Sgt. Class Jose Rodela was among the men previously overlooked due to their race

Honor: Sgt. First Class Melvin Morris was awarded the Medal of Honor for his courage in South Vietnam in 1969

Thanked: Sgt Santiago J. Erevia was cited for courage during a search and clear mission near Tam Ky, South Vietnam, on May 21, 1969. The recipients had been previously overlooked due to prejudice

Sgt 1st Class Melvin
 Morris from Cocoa, Florida was commended for courageous actions during 
combat operations in the vicinity of Chi Lang, 
South Vietnam, on September 17, 1969. He was wounded three times while 
recovering the body of his fatally wounded master sergeant.

Sgt Santiago J. Erevia, a former military radio operator of San Antonio, 
was cited for courage during a search and clear mission near Tam Ky, 
South Vietnam, on May 21, 1969.

Master Sgt Jose Rodela of San Antonio, was cited for courage while 
serving as a company commander during 18 hours of combat operations in 
Phuoc Long province, South Vietnam, on September 1, 1969.

The Medal of Honor was presented posthumously to the families of the 21 soldiers who have died.

Each of the soldiers had previously 
received the Distinguished Service Cross, which is the nation's second 
highest military award.

But in 2002, Congress called for a 
review of Jewish American and Hispanic American veteran war records from
 World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, to ensure those 
deserving the Medal of Honor had not been denied it because of prejudice
 at the time.

Saying thanks: The men were applauded during the ceremony in the East Room of the White House

During the 
review, records of several soldiers who were neither Jewish nor Hispanic
 were also found to have criteria worthy of the Medal of Honor, and 
these men have also been honored.

In
 an interview last month, Morris, who is black, said it never occurred 
to him that his race could have prevented him from receiving the top 
accolade.

When the Army contacted him last May and arranged for a call from Obama, he said he was astounded.

'I
 fell to my knees. I was shocked,' Morris said. 'President Obama said he
 was sorry this didn't happen before. He said this should have been done
 44 years ago.'

The Medal of Honor is awarded for personal acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty.

Fewer
 than 3,500 of the medals have been awarded to soldiers, sailors, 
airmen, Marines and Coast Guardsmen since it was created in 1861.
