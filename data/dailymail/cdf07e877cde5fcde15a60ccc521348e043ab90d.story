A matter of trust: British president and CEO of Formula One racing Bernie Ecclestone and his ex-wife Slavica

Bernie Ecclestone is accused today of avoiding a potential £1billion-plus tax bill after the UK tax authorities scrapped an inquiry in return for just £10million.

But the secret deal could now be overturned – and Formula One supremo Mr Ecclestone, 83, could again face a colossal tax bill – thanks to associated claims that his ex-wife Slavica mysteriously pays him £60million a year.

Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs last night refused to discuss the allegation that it spent nine years probing the tycoon's affairs and links with offshore family trusts before quietly reaching an agreement.

But the case focuses a fresh spotlight on complaints that the taxman is all too ready to agree 'sweetheart deals' with the super-rich and big businesses.

Last night Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry called for a new investigation into Mr Ecclestone and his family trusts by HMRC, saying that £10million was insignificant compared to potential tax bills.

Mr Ecclestone refused to answer detailed questions about his tax affairs but insisted that he had always paid his fair share and denied any wrongdoing.

His tangled financial affairs are under scrutiny in a German court where he is charged with giving banker Gerhard Gribkowsky a £27million bribe to ensure Formula One shares were sold to a company which supported Mr Ecclestone. Gribkowsky has already been jailed for eight and a half years over the cash, half of which appeared to have come from Mr Ecclestone, and half from the family trusts.

Crucially, fabulously wealthy sports mogul Mr Ecclestone admits making a huge payment, but denies it was a bribe, instead claiming he was being blackmailed by Gribkowsky. The banker, he says, was threatening to make untrue allegations to HMRC which could have cost him a fortune.

His potential tax bill hinges on offshore family trusts established by Mr Ecclestone in 1996, when he handed over ownership of his Formula One holdings.

The trusts – which have links to tax havens including Liechtenstein, Jersey, and elsewhere offshore – reputedly contain several billion pounds in profits from TV rights sales, from which the HMRC has received nothing in tax payments.

Mr Ecclestone last week told the Munich court he created the trusts legitimately to avoid ultimately paying out huge sums in inheritance tax, which he said would have been 'very unfair'.

According to him, they are entirely for the benefit of his jet-set daughters Tamara and Petra and ex-wife – and he neither has anything to do with the management of the funds involved, nor benefits from them. As a result, he says, he is not liable for any tax relating to the trusts.

But if it were to be proved that he did benefit from the trusts or help manage them, he could face a monumental tax bill – which he said in court could amount to more than £1billion. A long HMRC inquiry into the trusts, however, suddenly ended when £10million was handed over, BBC1's Panorama is to report tonight.

According to the programme, court documents reveal that one of the lawyers who runs the family trusts, Swiss solicitor Frederique Flournoy, told German prosecutors in 2011 that the long-running investigation by HMRC into the Ecclestone family trusts was settled in 2008.

She reportedly said: 'The Inland Revenue offered to conclude the matter if we paid £10million. Without knowing the legal basis that had given rise to this offer, we decided to pay up, without discussing things in great detail.'

Miss Flournoy is also said to have revealed that since Mr Ecclestone and his wife divorced in 2009, she had been paying him around £60million a year – a surprise to those who assumed it was he who had given her a massive payoff when they parted.

She said the payments were from his ex-wife directly, rather than from the family trusts – although she added that Slavica Ecclestone had herself taken about £700million from the trusts.

There was no answer at Mr Ecclestone's palatial home overlooking Hyde Park in Central London yesterday.

When approached by Panorama, Mr Ecclestone refused to answer detailed questions about the trusts. He did, however, deny any wrongdoing, saying he personally stumped up almost £52million in tax last year, and had always paid his fair share.

Mr Ecclestone said: 'Other Britons with my wealth and means have chosen to live abroad to avoid paying British taxes. However, I am proud to be British, proud to live in Britain, and proud to make my contribution by paying my taxes here.'

Mr Ecclestone said his divorce was a 'private matter', but there was nothing contrived or artificial about the transfer of assets to his wife in 1996.

A lawyer for the family trusts, meanwhile, said: 'Mr Ecclestone has not exerted, and has never sought to exert, any control over the management of the trusts.' The lawyer also said that the transcripts from the German prosecutor contained errors – but did not say what they were.

Slavica Ecclestone's lawyer said the family trusts were managed by appointed trustees who did not include Mr Ecclestone.

COMMENTARY by TOM BOWER

Money has always been Bernie Ecclestone's prime motivation.

Born in comparative poverty in East London, he became one of Britain's richest tycoons by transforming Formula One from a sport for car enthusiasts into a global brand producing profits of more than £1billion a year.

During that journey, he has learnt to duck and dive as he pocketed at least £2.5billion for himself.For a man who left school at 15 to trade motorbike parts while employed by the Gas Board, and who honed his skills by haggling over the prices of used cars with criminals, the fruits of his wealth have been sweet.

They include a large yacht, racehorses, fabulous houses across London and in Switzerland, a private jet and even his own airport in Biggin Hill.

With typical swagger, Ecclestone always pays in cash, often peeling off 500-euro notes from a wad. Indeed, he has been known to carry $1million (£600,000) in cash in a plastic bag – and then leave the bag in a room by mistake. With his vast fortune, $1million is petty cash.

Of course, it should be no surprise that someone who has amassed such wealth should come under intense public scrutiny – he is currently accused in a German court of paying a £27million bribe to a banker to secure the sale of a stake in Formula One to a company he favoured. Now he faces Panorama's allegations of a secret agreement to avoid £1billion in taxes.

For his part, Ecclestone, an inveterate gambler, is unfazed. Last night he told me: 'Everything about my taxes is clear and straight, yet everyone is looking for a mystery. It's not there.'

In the tycoon's view, Panorama is sensationalising an ordinary and legal arrangement.

Others, of course, may see  matters differently.

The story behind the BBC team's allegation started in 1996, when Ecclestone, then 66, was trying to raise £1billion by selling part of his Formula One empire.

During the negotiations, lawyers told him that his then wife, Slavica Malic, a statuesque Croatian model he met during the Italian Grand Prix in Monza, couldn't inherit his fortune without paying inheritance taxes because she was not domiciled  in Britain.

So, to avoid his family losing nearly half his fortune on his death, Ecclestone legally transferred his wealth to a trust in Switzerland which would be completely controlled by his wife for the benefit of herself and their two daughters. To guarantee that no inheritance taxes could be claimed by the Inland Revenue, Ecclestone would have no control over the trust.

Also, for the tax avoidance to be watertight, he had to live for another seven years.

The scheme nearly collapsed in 1999 when he required heart surgery. He survived but there was another hitch in 2008: Slavica decided to file for a divorce.

Suddenly, Ecclestone faced a major dilemma.

His lawyers advised that he could claim 50 per cent of the Swiss trusts from Slavica but that would ruin the perfect tax protection plan he had created. So instead, he asked Slavica to pay him what she thought 'fair'. Slavica duly agreed to give her ex-husband £60 million a year for ten years.

That crisis may have been overcome but it also coincided with an inquiry by the Inland Revenue into Ecclestone's private use of his company's cars, plane and homes.

In the Revenue's opinion, Ecclestone should have paid more tax on the benefits. In due course, both sides agreed to settle for a payment of £10million.

At the same time, Slavica agreed to settle her own outstanding taxes for having benefited from the trust, and she also paid the taxman £10million.

But it is the management of the family trust which has resulted in Ecclestone standing trial in Germany, charged with bribery.

In 2002, the then majority-owner of Formula One, a German TV tycoon, became bankrupt. His shares were seized by a German bank which had loaned him the money for the original purchase.

In a complicated case, the German authorities allege that Ecclestone bribed the German banker controlling the shares to ensure that Formula One was sold to a private equity group of Ecclestone's choice.

The prosecution alleges that by securing the sale of the stake to the company, Ecclestone would remain in charge of Formula One and its commercial rights, broadcast payments and sponsorship deals.

Ecclestone, who once advised me: 'Never threaten – just do it!', admits making the payment but says he was the victim of blackmail connected to the issue of whether he controlled his family trust in Switzerland.

Having transformed himself from a second-hand car dealer into the owner of one of the world's most popular sports, he admits he breaks rules – but not laws.

Controversially, he has said: 'First get on, then get rich, then get honest,' and, 'In Formula One, everyone cheats. The trick is not to get caught.'

Competitive to his core, with steel-tipped elbows, Ecclestone – like so many other tycoons – always wants to win.

'Show me a good loser,' he has said, 'and I'll show you a loser.'
