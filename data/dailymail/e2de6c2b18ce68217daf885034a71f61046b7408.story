A Bollywood actress is being used as a honey trap to lure English cricketers into fixing matches, according to an undercover investigation.

Bookmakers on the Indian subcontinent are using elaborate methods to target the domestic county game, which is televised around the globe, amid claims it is a soft touch.

llegal betting rings are prepared to offer up to £750,000 to change to outcome of games  in order to make huge sums on the results.

A sting by the Sunday Times alleges that a web of match-fixers are increasingly focusing their attention on the English county game and players because ‘nobody monitors them’.

Undercover reporters videoed Delhi bookmaker Vicky Seth boasting: ‘English county cricket is a good new market.

'They are low-profile matches and nobody monitors them. That’s why good money can be made there without any hassle if we can get the players to play for us.’

The investigation found those willing to influence a match could earn tens of thousands of pounds.

An official or player who could guarantee the outcome of a match could earn £750,000. A batsman could receive around £44,000 for slow scoring and bowlers might get £50,000 to concede runs.

Jailed: Three Pakistani cricketers (Mohammad Aamer, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt) were jailed for offences including bowling no-balls

The International Cricket Council, which is responsible for policing the game, refused to elaborate on claims it was aware of the Bollywood actress’ approaches to players or that it had launched its own probe into the developing scandal.

Colin Gibson, the ICC’s Head of Media and Communications, said: ‘We do not comment of Anti Corruption and Security Unit matters.’

A statement on the ICC’s website said: ‘Betting on cricket in the legal and illegal markets continues to grow rapidly and, with many, many millions of dollars being bet on every match, the threat of corruptors seeking to influence the game has not gone away. It is for these reasons that the ICC’s Anti Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) continues to pursue the three objectives of investigation, education, and prevention’.

A Met Police spokesman said: ‘We are not investigating this at the moment. But if the ICC were to come to us with evidence further down the line, we would consider opening an investigation, if we were the relevant force.’

This is the latest scandal to rock the already sullied reputation of cricket world-wide. 

Scandal: Mervyn Westfield of Essex was jailed for spot-fixing in which he agreed to concede a pre agreed number of runs

Last month, Essex cricketer Mervyn Westfield - once tipped as a future England bowler - was given a four-month prison term after admitting he had received £6,000 to concede at least 12 runs in his first over in the Natwest Pro40 game against Durham in 2009.

Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria was named in court as the man who allegedly corrupted him. Although Kaneria subsequently denied that allegation.

Three Pakistan internationals, former Test captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer, have also been imprisoned for match-fixing.

Jailing the men at Southwark Crown Court in November, last year, the judge Mr Justice Cooke told them: ‘It is the insidious effect of your actions on professional cricket and the followers of it that make the offences so serious.

The three players were jailed alongside agent Mazhar Majeed, who was caught orchestrating the scandal in an undercover sting by the News of the World.

They agreed to bowl three no-balls at specified points during a Lord’s Test match last August in return for £150,000.
