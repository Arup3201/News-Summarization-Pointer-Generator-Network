The old maxim goes that if men rather than women had to have babies, the human race would have died out long ago.

Now those birthing pains are being felt by men in China.

A hospital in the city of Jinan in eastern China's Shandong Province is hooking men up to a childbirth simulator to see what their partner's go through.

A hospital in the city of Jinan in eastern China's Shandong Province is hooking men up to a childrbirth simulator to see what their partner's go through.

The electronic device which simulates the experience of having a baby.

Technicians at the hospital use the device to stimulate muscles in the male abdomen with electric shocks to make it contract and at the same time simulate the pain endured by mothers during childbirth. 

Most of the volunteers are partners of pregnant women.

The hospital said they want to show men how much women suffer through childbirth, and to give men greater respect for what women go through.

'The event was aimed at creating awareness and more respect for childbearing women, especially highlighting the entire laborious nine-month process leading up to birth,' a hospital spokesman told CEN.

To recreate the contractions and pain of childbirth, hospital technicians used machines to stimulate the men's abdomens with electric shocks to make it contract.

Some men seemed reluctant— having been dragged there by their partners— while others were more enthusiastic, CEN reported.

'My wife is expecting a baby in three months, and we had a row when I told [her] not to make such a fuss,' father-to-be Guang Liao, 29, told CEN. 

'When she found out about this project, she told me had to sign up for it, so I also know what is was all about.'

Many of the participants were reduced to tears by the experience, and could only last a few minutes

The hospital said they want to show men how much women suffer through childbirth, and to give men greater respect for what women go through.

'I must admit I was curious and if what I experienced is really what she goes through, then I have to say I have changed my attitude. 

'It was really incredibly painful and I only had it for a few minutes. 

'If it went on for hours I don't know if I'd be able to bear it,' he told the news agency.

Technicians at the hospital use the device to stimulate muscles in the male abdomen with electric shocks to make it contract and at the same time simulate the pain endured by mothers during childbirth.

It is not the first time the system has been used.

On Mother's Day, male volunteers in Nanchang City, in south China's Jiangxi province, were hooked up to complex machines that provided them with a painful taste of what women go through in labour.

Some 20 men went on a local TV show to submit to the pains that women endure.

The challenge consisted of ten levels of pain with an agony scale from 50 to 500.

Electric shocks were sent into the abdomen of the male volunteers - including British singer Iain Inglis, 31, who lives and works in China - who gave up when the pain-o-meter hit 100.

'It was too much for me,' he said. 'The pain was terrible!'

Another man, Lee Hao, said: 'This was incredible. I couldn't stand much of it all. I understand now why my wife screamed for drugs when she was giving birth.'

Zhou Nan successfully stuck to the end and hit the 500 mark.

'I am the father of triplets and wanted to understand the great pain my wife experienced when she was giving birth,' he said.

'It was horrible. I have nothing but deep admiration for all mothers after this ordeal.'

Agony: The daring volunteers included British singer Iain Inglis, who lives and works in China. He gave up when the painometer hit 100

The simulated pain in the show lasted for a maximum of 30 seconds but women often have to endure it for hours or even days.

'This can help people realise how great mothers are,' said the event organiser.
