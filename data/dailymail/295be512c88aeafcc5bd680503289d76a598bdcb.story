British dressage star Charlotte Dujardin broke her own grand prix world record on the London International Horse Show's opening night at Olympia.

The reigning Olympic, world and European champion returned to competitive action just 48 hours after finishing fourth in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.

And the 29-year-old delivered a blistering performance on multi gold medal-winning wonderhorse Valegro to take the Reem Acra FEI World Cup grand prix class with a score of 87.460 per cent.

It eclipsed the combination's previous best of 87.129 per cent set at the World Cup final in France earlier this year.

And they will now set their sights on Wednesday's freestyle to music competition, which saw them post new world record figures of 93.975 per cent at Olympia 12 months ago.

The world number one dressage combination hold every on of the sport's major championships, including all three of the sport's world records - grand prix, grand prix special and freestyle.

Gloucestershire-based Dujardin emerged grand prix victor by a seven per cent margin from Holland's Edward Gal, riding Glock's Undercover, with another Dutch combination - Danielle Heijkoop and Siro - third.

Kauto Star, meanwhile, was back in the limelight at Olympia, when the five-times King George VI Chase winner and dual Cheltenham Gold Cup hero was ridden by British three-day eventer Laura Collett in a dressage demonstration that showcased how the 14-year-old gelding has adapted to his new career since being retired from racing.

The Clive Smith-owned Kauto Star retired from racing in 2012, but has been retrained in dressage by Collett.

He will be back on more familiar ground when he parades at Kempton on Boxing Day ahead of the William Hill King George VI Chase, which he made his own with victories in 2006-2009 and 2011.
