Google has announced a new smartphone and tablet, as well as the company's first TV streaming device.

Both mobile devices will run the new version of the firm's mobile operating system, Android 5.0, which has been confirmed to have the name Lollipop.

The Motorola-made Nexus 6 smartphone comes with a 5.96-inch Quad HD screen and a 13 megapixel rear-facing camera.

Google has announced a new smartphone - the Nexus 6 -  and tablet, the Nexus 9 - as well as the company's first TV streaming device in a bid to compete with Apple and Amazon

The Nexus 6 also has dual front-facing speakers designed to offer better quality audio, says Google. 

The handset sports a feature called Turbo Charger, which can give the phone up to six hours of battery life from just a 15 minute charge. The phone also boasts new hands-free voice activated functions.

It will come in two colours: midnight blue and cloud white and two storage options, 32 or 64GB.

Meanwhile, one day before Apple unveils its updated iPad family, the search giant has shown off its new Nexus 9 tablet, made by HTC.

The tablet, which is smaller than an iPad, but larger than and iPad Mini, is built for multi-tasking and has a brushed aluminium frame with a ‘soft grip’ back.

An upgrade in terms of size as well as internals on Google's existing Nexus 7, the new Nexus 9 has a 8.9-inch screen, and weighs in at 420g, making it 50g lighter than an iPad Air.

Because the 9 was built by HTC, it also takes advantage of their BoomSound speaker technology, complete with two front-facing speakers in the device, as opposed to the traditional down-facing output. This is for better quality audio, Google says. 

It is the first Nexus device to have a 64-bit processor for increased performance in terms of speed, particularly when playing games.

There is  an 8 megapixel rear-facing camera and, like the Nexus 6, the Nexus 9 will be accessible hands-free thanks to a new feature that enables voice command to be accessed without touching the phone.

Just saying 'Ok, Google' will activate Google Now, even when the phone is asleep, and while the voice command and personal assistant already existed on Android, with Lollipop it has been pushed to the front of the interface.

The Nexus 9 also has Turbo Charger functionality with a 64bit dual core processor to make switching between tasks fast.

Google's senior vice president of Android Sundar Pichai said: ‘Advances in computing are driven at the intersection of hardware and software. That's why we've always introduced Nexus devices alongside our platform releases.

In a less expected move, Google also announced the company's first full TV streaming device that will run their Android TV software, the Nexus Player.

The new streaming box enables users to watch TV shows as well as stream content from other devices to their TV, such as an Android phone, tablet or Chrome-based desktop computer.

The Nexus Player also comes with a video game controller and can be used to play games from the Google Play Store on TVs. 

Amazon has recently introduced a similar device, called the Fire TV. 

Sitting alongside Google's existing streaming device, the Chromecast, the Nexus Player is likely to be aimed at more premium users than the £30 Chromecast.

Google confirmed that the Nexus 9 will be available to pre-order in the UK from October 17 and will go on sale on November 3. It will come in three sizes: 16GB, 32GB and 32GB LTE.

The Nexus 6 smartphone will also arrive in November, with pre-order beginning on October 29.

The Nexus Player will be available to pre-order from October 17. UK prices have not yet been confirmed. 

The tablet has an 8.9-inch screen and HTC's BoomSound front-facing speakers.There is also an 8 megapixel rear-facing camera and, like the Nexus 6, the Nexus 9 can be voice activated without opening any apps

While Lollipop is being promised to be a redefining update by Google, we are yet to see it in action, thanks to a purely blog post-driven launch. 

The firm's latest Android operating system is designed to be flexible and to be used on different devices. It can now power a watch, TV and even a car. 

The new Turbo Charger is an impressive addition when combined with more detailed battery settings, and Google says this will lead to longer lasting devices. The battery saver feature extends the life of device by up to 90 minutes.

The support for 64-bit processing for the first time on Nexus devices is also an upgrade, with some of Google's native apps like Chrome and Gmail supporting this feature, essentially meaning they will run faster and smoother than before.

Songs, photos, apps and recent searches from one Android device are immediately accessible on another.

Content responds to people's touch and their voice.

The operating system is designed to be more intuitive and better at multi-tasking. For example, users will be able to read an email alongside seeing their inbox.

Users can adjust their settings so only notifications from certain people and apps can get through and they will appear on the lockscreen. 

Devices can be secured using a pin, password or pattern - or now they can be linked to a trusted device like a watch or smart lock. 

Google has also confirmed that as well as being built into their new devices, Lollipop will be available on the existing Nexus 5,7 and 10 devices 'in the coming weeks'.
