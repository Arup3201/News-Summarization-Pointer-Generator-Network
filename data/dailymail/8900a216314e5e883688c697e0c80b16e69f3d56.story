Psychologist Stephen Kellaway was caught after the Mail tracked him down to Thailand.

He had been living under an assumed name after swindling £43,000 in housing and council tax benefits.

Family holiday: Stephen and Nelli Kellaway during their trip to Russia

Kellaway faked his death during a family holiday to Russia, where his wife had breast enlargement surgery.

He bribed a Moscow mortuary worker 
with a bottle of vodka to place his passport on a dead tramp and got his
wife to identify the body as his.

He later fled to Bangkok using a 
false passport in the name of a boy who had died, and lived off the 
rental income from his £1million London property portfolio.

The father of two planned to bring 
his family out to Thailand to live with him by cashing in three life 
insurance policies worth £1.7million.

However his time on the run came to an end when the Mail discovered he was alive and confronted him.

Thai authorities later deported the 
54-year-old back to Britain where he admitted a string of benefits fraud
and false documentation offences.

Yesterday, jailing him for two years 
and eight months at Croydon Crown Court, Judge Shani Barnes said he had 
carried out a ‘cynical and selfish plan’.

She said: ‘It struck at the very 
heart of the benefits system. People such as yourself who criminally 
steal from those who rely on benefits and from the taxpayers who pay for
them, undermine that system and demolish its credibility.’

Hammersmith and Fulham Council, which
brought the prosecution, praised the Mail for helping to bring Kellaway
to justice, describing our role as ‘British investigative journalism at
its very best.’

Kellaway began planning his scam in 
2008 after being inspired by the case of fraudster John Darwin, who fled
to Panama after supposedly dying in a canoe accident.

Kellaway at one point earned £100,000
a year from his counselling service in West London. He and his 
Russian-born wife Nelli, 42, owned five houses and flats which the court
heard made money in ‘large measures’ through rent and rising house 
prices.

But to help pay their multiple 
mortgages and children’s school fees, they also fraudulently claimed 
housing benefit on their portfolio.

Realising the net was closing in on 
them, they went on holiday to Russia, where Mrs Kellaway had her breast 
operation. The ‘widow’ was arrested as she returned to London in 
November 2008 carrying an urn which she claimed contained Kellaway’s 
ashes and his three life insurance policies.

She later convinced a court that her 
‘abusive’ husband had forced her into the fraud and escaped with a 
suspended sentence. Meanwhile Kellaway used the birth certificate of a 
seven-year-old from Belfast who died of heart problems to get an Irish 
passport.

He returned to the UK under his new 
identity, and was spotted  several times visiting his parents in 
Brighton, before jetting off to Sri Lanka and then to Thailand.

In Bangkok, he lived on rental income
he received from the UK for several months before he was mugged and 
lost his false passport – meaning he had no identification to collect 
his payments.

When the Mail caught up with him last
summer he was living rough at the city’s airport and begging for food. 
He admitted his fraud, explaining: ‘Parts of my life on the run were 
very James Bond, but parts were also very squalid, and I wouldn’t 
recommend what I have done.’

Kellaway admitted three counts of benefit fraud and possession and use of a false identification document yesterday.

Judge Barnes described his scam and 
fake death as ‘well thought out and professional.’ She said: ‘You 
planned it in a way that was persistent and intelligent. You used a 
false identification to cynically hide your real identification from the
police and avoid detection for your abject dishonesty.

‘What a sorry mess this all is.’
