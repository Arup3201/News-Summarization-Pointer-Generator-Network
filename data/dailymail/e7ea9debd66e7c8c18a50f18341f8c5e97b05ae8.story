Celebrities might looks smug in suggestive photographs but they might not be enjoying themselves as much as they would have us believe.

New research suggests that many racy photos and messages, known as sexts, are sent out of obligation to a partner, instead of for fun.

Young people in committed relationships regularly send and receive unwanted sexts out of necessity and men are just as unenthusiastic about them as women, according to a study.

University students in committed relationships regularly send and receive unwanted explicit messages and photos out of necessity and men are just as unenthusiastic about them as women, a new study suggests

U.S. scientists behind the study have dubbed the messages not sent for pleasure as ‘requisexts’.

The research reveals that just as some 
couples go along with sex to please their partner or avoid an argument, 
the same is true of e-sex and sexts.

Psychologists from Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne polled 155 undergraduates, who were in committed relationships, about their sexting habits and discovered that sexting is common among young adult undergraduates.

A graph showing the frequency with which women and men engaged in unwanted but consensual sexting. The study found 55 per cent of female participants admitted to sexting when not in the mood, while 48 per cent of men said they had done the same as a way to please a partner

Their study, which will be published in the journal Computers in Human behaviour, found 55 per cent of female participants admitted to sexting when not in the mood, while 48 per cent of men said they had done the same as a way to please a partner.

The numbers are similar to a previous report about ‘compliant sexual activity’ which revealed that 55 per cent of U.S. women and 35 per cent of men had had sex to keep their partner happy when they weren’t feeling like it, The Huffington Post reported.

The psychologists believe gender role expectations could help to explain the behaviour, as men are more likely to engage in unwanted sexting because joining in is ‘relatively easy and does not require them to invest more into the relationship’.

Women insecure in their long-term relationship who feared being dumped were more likely to be requisexters, perhaps in the hope the act make their partner seem less distant, the study said

They also think that women might be turned off by sexting as it does not help them reach relationship ‘goals’, but when polled, some of the survey’s participants said they simply did it because they were bored.

People mostly participated in an exchange of X-rated pictures for ‘flirtation, foreplay, or to meet partner’s needs,’ as well as boosting intimacy, the study said.

The researchers wrote: ‘Consenting to avoid an argument was a mediator in the relationship between anxious attachment and consenting to unwanted sexting.’

The perfect recipe for love used to be eyes meeting across a crowded room followed by hours of scintillating conversation but now it seems that stimulating chats have been replaced by 140-character tweets.

According to a recent study, Twitter is now the most common way of winning over a potential new partner and has even overtaken texting and phone calls.

On average, it now takes 224 tweets, 163 text messages, 70 Facebook messages, 37 emails and 30 phone calls to seal the deal.

The study, which was conducted by electronics retailer PIXmania, found that within the space of a single generation, the amount of time taken for love to blossom has more than halved.

Couples aged 55 and over said on average their courting process took more than two and a half months (78 days) whereas for those under the age of 25 it takes just under one month (24 days) for them to refer to each other as boyfriend and girlfriend.

As a result, researchers believe that this could signals the end of the traditional 'three day rule' where would-be lovers wait for 72 hours before calling a date back.

Instead, it's now closer to three hours, with two thirds saying they were happy to contact their new beau within four hours of their first date.
