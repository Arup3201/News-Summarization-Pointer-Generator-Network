Rescue teams failed to find any sign Monday of three men missing after a ridge saturated with rain collapsed, sending mud sliding for 3 miles in a remote part of western Colorado.

Clancy Nichols, 51, a county road and bridge employee, his son Danny, 24, and Wes Hawkins, 46, have been missing since Sunday after the ridge collapsed. They went to check on damage from an initial slide near the edge of Grand Mesa, one of the world's largest flat-topped mountains, after a rancher reported that his irrigation ditch had stopped flowing, Mesa County Sheriff Stan Hilkey said.

'Everyone on this mountain is praying for a miracle right now,' Hilkey said.

Wreckage: Hundreds of trees are knocked down where a massive mudslide happened near Collbran, Colorado. Rescue teams are searching for three men missing

Damage: the aftermath of the Mesa County mudslide is seen from a plane on Monday nearly Collbran, Colorado

The search near the small town of Collbran has been hampered because only the lower third of the slide is stable. Even at the edges, the mud is 20 to 30 feet deep. It's believed to be several hundred feet deep and about a half mile wide.

Deputies estimate that the entire ridge had been moving for most of Sunday before someone called to report the slide at 6:15 p.m., describing it as sounding like a freight train.

Hilkey believes runoff from Grand Mesa from recent rain triggered the slide. A hydrologist from the Natural Weather Service and a geologist from the U.S. Geological Survey were helping authorities assess the situation.

Hawkins' cousin, Bill Clark, said he went along with Clancy and Danny Nichols to check on why an irrigation ditch had stopped flowing because he works for an area water district. He said he has a family and young children.

Clark, who visited the canyon where the slide struck, said it was completely filled with mud. He said the slide struck with so much force that some also spilled over into the neighboring draw.

'I've never seen so much earth move like that in my life,' he said.

From a distance of about 10 miles, the slide looked like a funnel, narrowing into a culvert below. It cut a giant channel through trees. The creek that once gradually flowed down the ridge now spurted down like a waterfall. Roads in the area, where some cattle grazed, were muddy from rain.

'How in the devil could this happen?' said Collbran resident Lloyd Power, gazing out at the slide.

He said residents were praying for the missing. 'That's all we can do,' Power said.

While the surrounding area is popular place for fishing, hiking and camping, the slide hit on land with an access gate that isn't open to the public. No one else is believed missing and no homes were damaged.

Energy companies were monitoring oil and gas wells in the area, part of the productive Piceance Basin, but so far the mud has only come up to the edge of one pad operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp. The three wells there have been shut down, said David Ludlam, executive director of the West Slope Colorado Oil & Gas Association, a trade group.

Hilkey said he'd received a telephone call from authorities in Washington state, where a March 22 landslide swept a square mile of dirt, sand and silt through a neighborhood in Oso, about an hour northeast of Seattle. That slide leveled homes and killed at least 43 people.

The Mesa County sheriff's department estimated the slide is about 4 miles long, 2 miles wide and about 250 feet deep in many places.

'This slide is unbelievably big,' Mesa County Lt. Phil Stratton said.

The site is in a
 rural part of the county and there were no reports of any structures 
damaged or major roads affected, McCammon said.

A
 unified incident command was established between Plateau Valley 
Fire Department and the Mesa sheriff, to handle the slide and search for
 the people possibly caught in it.

Authorities said the heavy rains that fell over the weekend contributed to the slide.

The
 avalanche occurred about two months after a massive mudslide hit the 
Washington state community of Oso on March 22, killing 43 people.

The National Weather Service in Boulder, Colorado issued an advisory 
this month warning that monsoon rains which caused flooding in the state
 last September could increase the possibility of landslides as the 
state's deep snowpack melts.

'The September 2013 rains likely 
destabilized hillsides and steep slopes, so increased landslides and 
rock slides will also be possible this spring, particularly with heavier
 or prolonged rainfall,' the weather service said.

Roadblocks have been set up to keep people from the rural area. Conditions are described as 'very unstable' by authorities.
