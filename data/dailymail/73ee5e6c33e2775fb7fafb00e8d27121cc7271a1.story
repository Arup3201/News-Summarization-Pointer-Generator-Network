She launched her new lifestyle website Preserve amid great fanfare this week, admitting: 'I’m no editor, no artisan, no expert'.

But Blake Lively's foray into foraging for the best of 'Main Street, USA', is having some teething problems as it draws critics over her top, somewhat eccentric, picks to buy.

Perhaps the most bizarre object for sale so far is a $95 Porter Cycling wooden crate, similar to one you could pick up at the market. In flowery raptures, the boxes are described as: 'The bones of old New York get a new lease on life in these Dutch-style bicycle crates.

'Built to 
last a lifetime from reclaimed local wood sealed with natural tung oil, 
each beautiful Brooklyn-made piece is imbued with its own unique 
character. Caboose it onto your bike to carry the day’s produce, 
impromptu flowers for your sweetheart, or whatever you need to transport
 in a stylish manner—emission-free!'

Indeed, as the Guardian points out, similar crates are on sale on ebay for just 99 cents, as writer Eleanor Robertson said the site just makes her 'want to each the rich'.

Preserve: Blake Lively's new lifestyle website hasn't gotten off to the best start

Similarly, there is a crystal bowl for $450 by Jon McCoy designs that Blake assures us will impart 'beauty, imagination and warmth to those who welcome these captivating crystals into their home.'

However, so far, many of the products on that site that seems to take inspiration from Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle haven, Goop, have imparted scorn.

Fashion blogger BryanBoy tweeted: 'After visiting Blake Lively's new site, I'd like to preserve my dignity by preserving my opinions where the sun doesn't shine.'

Salt-wise, the artisan salt collection by Laguna Salt is for sale at $40 is billed with the message: 'It's been said, variety is the spice of life.

'Diversify yours with this sensorily sophisticated set of splendid seasonings.' The pack includes a 'fantasia of far-flung flavors' including Tahitian Vanilla, Wild Ginger, and California Red salt, while varying flavors start at $10.

And for budding chefs, pick up a $140 Butcher's Apron or $110 Bistro Apron, from By The Country Cat, with the description: 'Running a restaurant is messy business' adding that aprons include 'classic pinstripe fabric and pockets convenient for 
both chef and wait staff.'

While Bitchin BBQ Sauce and All Purpose Rub By Stuart and Co ($25) will leave you 'a legend of backyard barbecues, your culinary star rising among all who savor your victorious victuals.'

And of course there's pickles.'Anytime is a good time for a great pickle!' according to Preserve, which is selling The Real Dill Pickles by The Real Dill for $18.50. 'Enjoy them straight out of the jar, or chop them up and add 
flecks of capricious character to tuna salads and deviled eggs.'

Flavors
 include Caraway Garlic, Habanero Horseradish and Jalapeno and the site declares: 'Oh, the crunch of a punchy pickle! Flush with fresh dill and dripping with delicious brine.'

Along with a pricy 'Heart Marquee' (a 
fancy wall light) by Scott Coppersmith for $300, Preserve has also 
curated thought bubbles by the same designer priced between $250 and 
$300, because 'any thought merits a spot on the board'.

Indeed,
 the site urges you to 'spark your bulb and bring a fresh light to your 
thinking process with the Thought Bubble. Make sure to jot down that 
brilliant idea!'.

If you're in the mood for a sailboat bow tie, it's yours for $70, as is a cactus flower necktie for $100. 'Crafted exclusively in 
the Northeastern U.S., their creations combine modern whimsy with the 
exacting standards of old fashioned quality,' Preserve boasts.

'Oh the crunch of a punchy pickle!': Dill pickles on sale for $25 on Preserve - and the $95 wooden crate

'A legend of backyard barbecues': Indulge in $18.50 BBQ sauce and meat rub - and a $40 salt collection

'Captivating crystals': a bowl on sale for $450 and the salt set, with flavors including Tahitian Vanilla, Wild Ginger, and California Red salt

Meanwhile, a blue bandana is on sale for $62 - as are 'Mr & Mrs' branded Spoons for $25.

For coffee table fans, the website also has on sale a first edition hardcopy book titled Love Letters From New 
Orleans, with the note: 'Whether it's white sugar sprinkled on top of beignets like 
fresh snowflakes, a fiery festival complete with torches, or a jazz 
musician pouring his soul through a trumpet, this tome celebrates the 
creative circus of the city that is New Orleans.'

It's not just the carefully curated and crafted items for sale that have drawn scorn. An introductory video clip, which was created by Brian Rowland, which features a young girl writing in a journal underneath a tree while The Nature of Consciousness, a work by late British philosopher Alan Watts, is read aloud in the background, has been called a 'nightmare' by New York Magazine, which called the entire site a 'horror movie'.

It seems Blake, 26, who made her name on TV hit Gossip Girl, gained inspiration for the website's name from her wedding day.

The
 star wore a couture Marchesa gown when she ecretly tied the knot with 
actor Ryan Reynolds at Boone Hall Plantation in Mt. Pleasant, South 
Carolina, two years ago.

And
 she recently revealed that the custom-made dress was damaged at her 
wedding reception - though Ryan helped her cope with the disappointment.

Just what you always wanted! Speech bubbles by Scott Coppersmith range from $250-$300

'Florence Welch was singing at the reception, and they brought out these sparklers, and I’m watching her sing. I look down and my wedding dress has a big burn mark from one of the sparklers. Right on the front! And it was just so heartbreaking to me,' she tells Vogue in the magazine's August issue.

She continued: 'And later, my dress was hanging up and Ryan said, "Isn’t that beautiful?" I said, "What?" And he pointed to the burn. My heart just stopped, because it was such a sensitive little subject. And he said, "You’ll always remember that moment with Florence singing and the sparklers. You have that forever, right there, preserved." Now that’s my favorite part of the dress.'

She admits 
she has found it hard to launch the site, writing in her editor's 
letter: 'I’m more intimidated than I should probably admit. I’m no 
editor, no artisan, no expert. And certainly no arbiter of what you 
should buy, wear, or eat.

'I am hungry, though... not just for enchiladas. I'm hungry for experience.

'I'm
 comfortable with the knowledge that I'm not a teacher, but rather, a 
student. I don't do any one thing perfectly. I do a lot of things 
though. Some well, some not-so-well.'

Happy couple: Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, seen here at Cannes in May 2014, have been married almost two years

If you want to be a SERIOUS chef, you need a $110 Butcher's apron - and perhaps a book of love letters to New Orleans for $35

According to Blake, she and her team think of the site not as a lifestyle website but a 'new street.'

'A sort of greatest hits of "Main Street, USA". While the whole world races to keep up with technology, we tighten our laces, join the race, but our end goal is to preserve what's already there.

However, now that they both have lifestyle sites, don't expect Blake to start a war with Gwyneth. The Gossip Girl star recently name dropped her fellow online retail blogger, telling Vogue she is always in both the actress's and Martha Stewart's corner.

Blake said: 'I’m always the first person to defend Gwyneth Paltrow. Or any woman in a position of power, like Martha Stewart or Oprah, who gets burned. Because they have paved the path for so many other women who are doing something they believe in.'
