A zookeeper has been suspended after allegedly punching a seal when it struggled as handlers tried to weigh it.

The South American fur seal put up a fight as staff tried to lift it on to a weighing machine during a routine health check.

But bosses at Bristol Zoo Gardens have now launched an investigation after it emerged a senior animal keeper punched the seal to keep it still.

The zoo's head vet has examined all the seals at the popular tourist attraction and the seal is believed to have made a full recovery.

All the seals remain on public show in their enclosure.

A Bristol Zoo Gardens spokeswoman said: 'A senior animal keeper at Bristol Zoo Gardens has been suspended pending further investigation of an alleged animal welfare incident that has recently come to light.

Bristol Zoo Gardens was founded in 1835 by a group of eminent local citizens and opened to the public a year later - making 2013 its 177th anniversary.

It has around 165 staff and more than 300 volunteers to run its activity centre and animal encounter sessions, and to care for more than 400 different specials of animals.Â 

As well as being home to South American fur seals, the zoo also has African penguins, flamingos, Pygmy hippos, Asiatic Lions, Red Pandas, meerkats, as well as a bug world, butterfly forest and an aquarium.

'As this is an ongoing investigation, Bristol Zoo is currently unable to discuss the details of the incident.

'However, the zoo has acted rapidly and comprehensively by instigating an immediate, formal and extensive investigation in line with its internal policies and legal welfare requirements.

'Michelle Barrows, head of veterinary services, has examined the seal family and all individuals are behaving normally, engaging happily and playfully with keepers and guests in their enclosure.

'The animal has been, and continues to be, on full public show.

'Bristol Zoo would like to make it very clear that it has a zero tolerance towards such behaviour and takes its commitment to the highest standards of animal welfare and conservation seriously.'
