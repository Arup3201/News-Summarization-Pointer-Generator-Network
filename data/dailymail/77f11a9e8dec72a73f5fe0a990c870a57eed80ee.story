The expectations. The stress. The disappointments. The heat. The boisterous crowd shouting like maniacs as you try to concentrate at match point. It’s all enough to send anyone to breaking point.

Temper tantrums are nothing new for the sport, with many tennis professionals channeling their inner-child in the middle of crowded arenas.  

Serena Williams threatened the line judge in 2009 and Xavier Malisse’s had a hissy fit in 2005, lying on the ground and refusing to get up and resume the match.

Of course, it would be remiss not to mention the most famous on-court dummy spit: John McEnroe’s ‘You can not be serious’ tirade at Wimbledon in 1981.

Each were memorable for all the wrong reasons and the 2015 Australian Open Grand Slam has been no different.

Several competitors this year have revealed a less-than-flattering side of their personalities whilst Down Under, succumbing to meltdowns on the hot Melbourne courts.

On Saturday night, 19th seed John Isner took his rage to centre stage following his shock straight-set loss to unseeded Gilles Muller.

An irate Isner threw his tennis racquet across the court twice, running after it to give it another serve to ensure his equipment was sufficiently destroyed.

With all the force he could muster the US tennis star slammed the tennis racquet across the floor, where it bounced several times before laying crumpled and useless.

It’s not the first time the fiery American has caused some serious damage on court.

He showed similarly undesirable traits in 2012 –whacking a tennis ball forcefully into the stands and maiming yet another tennis racquet following a disagreement with the chair umpire.

Then, the tennis champ received a warning for 'unsporstsmanlike conduct' and lost the match in five sets.

Homegrown hero Nick Kyrgios was the one being reprimanded this year.

In Round One, the up-comer lost his cool, smashing his tennis racquet in frustration at the sidelines.

During his temper tantrum, the youth struck his racquet repeatedly against the floor whilst swearing in frustration.

The 19-year-old received a new racquet - as well as a $4500 fine for racquet abuse and audible obscenity.

However the new racquet was used to win the match and overcome his back pain, which possibly could have triggered his ugly spat.

When Serena Williams faced off against 20-year-old Elina Svitolina on day six of the Australian Open, it seemed an early exit may be imminent for the world number one.

Young Ukrainian Svitolina quickly put herself ahead 4-1 in the first set.

Despite her opponent furiously fighting back to 4-5, Svitolina secured the first set.

Clearly Williams felt her form slipping and was not afraid to show her anger with each error in the opening minutes of the match.

The passionate tennis player yelled in her heated frustration.

However, the 33-year-old was able to maintain the rage and quickly got back on top, taking out the next two sets 6-2 and 6-0 to proceed through to the fourth round.

There was heat from both sides of the net when Aussie Lleyton Hewitt and German Benjamin Becker faced off for their round two clash on Thursday night.

Hewitt was knocked out of his 19th and possibly last Australian Open despite a strong start, winning the first two sets essentially uncontested.

In the most frustrating of circumstances, the 33-year-old went on to lose the next three sets to Becker.

Hewitt also threw his racquet and was not amused at he watched it bounce back over his head.

Despite his triumph, the gruelling match became too much for Becker, who also threw his racquet after losing a point to Hewitt – obviously unaware that his luck was about to change. 

With the Tennis Australia ready and waiting to hand out hefty fines to discipline poor conduct, the cost of a tantrum often adds up to fare more than just the price of a replacement racquet.
