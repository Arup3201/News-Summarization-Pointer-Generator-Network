For crime fans, they are an unlikely pairing.

One is a ‘feelgood’ detective drama set in picturesque English villages, while the other is the Nordic noir genre of brutal violence and twisting plots.

But the producers of Midsomer Murders have decided to join forces with hit Danish series The Killing and Borgen for a special anniversary edition.

Long-running British drama Midsomer Murders is teaming up with the Danish producers behind The Killing to film its 100th episode

The cast of Midsomer will be dispatched to Copenhagen for the show’s 100th episode.

It will be the first time that the ITV drama has been filmed outside of the UK.

Two
Danish actresses - The Killing's Ann Eleonora Jorgensen and Borgen's 
Birgitte Hjort Sorensen - will feature in The Killings At Copenhagen.

Danish crime drama The Killing and political series Borgen, both shown on BBC4, have proved a hit with British viewers.

The episode, to be shown in the forthcoming 16th series, will be made with DR, producer of The Killing.

DR's series acquisitions executive Kaare Schmidt said: 'Midsomer Murders is a benchmark in television entertainment and Danish viewers' favourite programme for more than a decade.

'It's an honour and a thrill for us to be able to contribute to the series' distinguished line of murder victims and police detectives.'

Viewers will see DCI Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) and DS Nelson (newcomer Gwilym Lee) travel to Denmark after a body is discovered which links back to a family in Midsomer in the one-off episode, which will also be filmed in Midsomer's first UK murder location, Badger's Drift.

Executive producer Jo Wright said: 'Midsomer Murders is incredibly popular on prime-time Danish television.

The Killings At Copenhagen will also feature Pernille Birk (Ann Eleonora Jorgensen, third from right)

'It is known as Barnaby and has been running for 12 years, winning 40% of the audience share.

'The idea to shoot in Denmark came about because we wanted to do something special to mark the 100th episode, and it's great to be working with DR, producer of the award winning series The Killing.'

In 2011, Midsomer's producer was suspended after sparking a row when he claimed part of the show's appeal was an absence of ethnic minorities.

Brian True-May, the drama's co-creator, said that the ITV1 programmes 'wouldn't work' if there was any racial diversity in the village life.

'We just don't have ethnic minorities involved. Because it wouldn't be the English village with them. It just wouldn't work....We're the last bastion of Englishness and I want to keep it that way,' he said.

He was later reinstated but stepped down from the show the same year.

The programme, based on the books by Caroline Graham, was launched in 1997 and is sold to 225 territories around the world.
