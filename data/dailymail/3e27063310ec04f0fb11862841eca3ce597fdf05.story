A pair of robbers dubbed the 'clumsiest crooks' in Texas are being sought after they were caught on security video bumping into each other and then firing their weapons while raiding a 24-hour adult store.

Houston Police Department spokesman Jeff Brieden said the duo were the most amateur thieves he'd ever come across - though they still managed to elude authorities.

'I have to say that in the seven years that I've been investigating robberies, these are by far some of the clumsiest crooks that I've seen in a long time,' he said in a press conference Wednesday.

Clumsy: A pair of robbers dubbed the 'clumsiest crooks' in Texas are being sought after they were caught on security video, pictured, bumping into each other and then firing while raiding a 24-hour adult store

The men were among three suspects who walked into a Katz's Boutique - a 24 hour adult store - in the 9800 block of the North Freeway at around 3a.m. on April 13.Â 

Police said two of the men were armed and the video footage shows a suspect holding a revolver apparently bump into his accomplice, who was holding a rifle.

The knock caused the rifle to discharge, 'which then spooked both the suspects,' Brieden told reporters.

Both men then began shooting, seemingly 
under the impression that they were being attacked. In reality, all the 
gunfire was coming from them.

After firing nearly a dozen rounds, the video shows one suspect shooting through a mannequin and the shop's glass window before they both flee the scene.

Brieden described the pair as extremely dangerous, 'because of how unpredictable they were during the robbery.'

'And just discharging their weapons so freely in any direction; this case easily could have turned into a capital murder,' he added.

No customers were inside the lingerie store at the time of the robbery. Two workers hid and were not harmed, police said.

Authorities are appealing for any information on the whereabouts of the suspects, who they believe were aged between 18 and 25.
