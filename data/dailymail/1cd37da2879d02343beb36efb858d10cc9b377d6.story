More than a quarter of a million car insurance claims are made each year in the US alone for damages caused by hail stones. 

And now an inventor has devised a 'bouncy castle-inspired' system to protect vehicles from these storms.

Called Hail Protector, the cover inflates within five minutes to surround a car or truck and stops stones damaging the chassis beneath.

The inflatable protector was inspired by a bouncy castle and was designed by Texas-based Michael Siciliano. It works with an early warning app that gives drivers up to 30 minutes notice about the chances of a hail storm at four different locations. These locations can include the driver's home or office, for example

The protector was designed by Texas-based Michael Siciliano.

It works with an early warning app that gives drivers up to 30 minutes notice about the chances of a hail storm at four different locations. These locations can include the driver's home or office, for example. 

But the process isn't quick.  

The driver must get to their vehicle, unpack the cover and place it over their car, plug in the remote control and hit a button to start inflating it - which alone takes five minutes.

Once inflated, though, its makers claim the cover can protect cars from hail stones as large as 2lbs (1kg).

The button on the remote is powered through a car battery or plug socket and it activates four blowers typically used as cooling fans in desktop computers.

Once forewarned, the driver must get to their vehicle, unpack the cover and place it over their car (left), plug in the remote control and hit a button to start inflating it - which alone takes five minutes. Air flow remains constant throughout the storm and once it passes, the cover can be compacted to fit in a boot (right)

Air flow remains constant - much like a bouncy castle - throughout the storm and once it passes, the cover can be compacted to fit in a boot.

Depending on the length of the storm, this could also have an impact on the car's battery life - especially when stationary.

Mr Siciliano, 48, said: 'Physically, the Hail Protector System uses similar principles to bouncy castles.

'In 2009 it came to me that there is no solution for protecting vehicles from the damaging effect of hail.

'I was working in renewable energy at the time, but throughout my career I would look at an issue or problem and ask 'why don't they come up with something that will fix this?''

The system has been publicly tested against air cannons, cantaloupes, coconuts, watermelons and baseball pitching machines.

Additionally, the system has been tested in winds in excess of 60mph (97km/h) and comes with an instructional video of how to use it.

The Hail Protector is available in six sizes - three for sedans, hatchbacks and wagons and three for SUVs, vans and trucks. 

These range from vehicles 10ft (3.3 metres) up to 22ft (6.7 metres) long.

Prices start at $349 (£226) and the inventors are in talks to set up distribution centres in Europe. 

Mr Siciliano added: 'We are in the final development of a new option for The Hail Protector System.

'The option will enable activation and deactivation of the system via a text message from anywhere in the world.

'We are also developing a mobile app for the system which will provide alerting in a more informational way and will eventually enable the user to press a button within the mobile app to activate and deactivate their system.

'The mobile app is between three and 12 months away from launch.'
