The husband of the housekeeper who worked for Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade filed a court complaint that his wife was being kept in 'slavery-like conditions' and his family was threatened with being kidnapped, it has been revealed.

Philip Richard, husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard, filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. 

Mr Richard also said the consular 
official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family 
saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug 
charges.

The release of the new document this week reveals that a legal complaint was lodged against Devyani Khobragade in her home country prior to charges of visa fraud being filed against her in the U.S. this month. Mr Richard's claim was dismissed later in July because the Indian court had 'no jurisdiction... on foreign soil'.

Consular official Dr Khobragade was arrested this month as she dropped her children off at their Manhattan school. She is accused of lying on a visa application for Mrs Richard with prosecutors claiming she only paid the servant $3 per hour.

In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com, a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions or keeping a person in bondage.'

The petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.'

Mr Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of what the woman took.

Mrs Richard's daughter Jennifer also wrote a letter to U.S. officials saying that her mother was unhappy and wanted to return to India but the diplomat refused to let her go.

Mr Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, because the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on foreign soil'.

The case has escalated into an international incident with Indians reacting with fury over the treatment of Khobragade who claims she was strip searched at a New York jail before being held in a cell with drug addicts and sex workers.

Prosecutors allege that Khobragade falsely signed visa documents for the worker saying that she would be paid $4,500 a month.

Then, when the housekeeper came to the U.S., Khobragade told her that she would be making only 30,000 rupees a month - less than $600, according to prosecutors.

India's foreign minister has demanded the U.S. drop charges against Khobragade.

Although Secretary of State John Kerry made a phone call to Indian officials last week to placate the situation, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara released a 
statement saying that 
the charges would not be dropped.

Uttam Khobragade, father of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade, has been accused of harassing the family of her housekeeper after they complained about her treatment

The statement read: 'One wonders why there is so much outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian national accused of perpetrating these acts, but precious little outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian victim and her spouse?'

Attorney Dana Sussman, who is 
representing Mrs Richard though the non-profit victim assistance agency Safe 
Horizon, spoke on Sunday of her ‘frustration and disappointment’ that 
focus had slipped from ‘crimes that were committed’ to ‘the criminal 
defendant.

She pointed out that the case was about Dr Khobragade allegedly lying to the federal government about the wages she was paying Mrs Richard.

Mrs Richard has claimed she as paid just $3.31 an hour, below minium wage.

Ms Sussman refused to comment on her client and her family’s whereabouts since Mrs Richard walked out of her job in June.

Dana Sussman, who is representing Sangeeta Richard, she says the real story of the alleged fraud has been lost in the diplomatic row

Mrs 
Richard’s husband Philip and parents flew to the U.S. two days before 
police swooped on Khobragade and arresting her at the gates of her 
daughter’s Upper East Side school.

U.S. diplomats in India swiftly found 
many of their privileges rescinded and safety barriers removed from 
their embassy in New Delhi.

Secretary
 of State John Kerry expressed his ‘regret as well as his concern’ over 
the incident in a telephone call to Indian National Security Advisor 
Shivshanker Menon.

He spoke of his hope that the ‘close and vital 
relationship with India’ remain unharmed.

But
 nothing short of dropping the charges – one count of Visa Fraud one of 
False Statement – against Dr Khobragade seems likely to satisfy Indian 
authorities in the case which has now been raised in the nation’s 
parliament.

Against this 
backdrop Mrs Sussman’s statement continued: ‘Mrs Richard is not on trial
 here and we think that the message here has been lost in the fact that 
there are charges against Khobragade for violating US law and those 
charges relate to the underpayment of wages to a domestic worker.

‘That is the story that has been lost in the diplomatic row that has erupted between US and India.’
