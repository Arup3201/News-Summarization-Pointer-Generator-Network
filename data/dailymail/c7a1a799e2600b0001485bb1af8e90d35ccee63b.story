Prescription drug addicts are abusing the NHS to feed their habits by ‘doctor shopping’ around different GP surgeries, MPs warn today.

The Home Affairs Committee report revealed as many as 1.5million people are addicted to prescription drugs in the UK.

It found fears many visit multiple GP practices to secure drugs and feed their habit. Among the most popular are painkillers such as diazepam and Tramadol.

Diazepam: Drug addicts are feeding their addiction by 'doctor shopping' at different surgeries

The committee urged GPs to start collecting data on patients they suspect are hooked on prescribed drugs so the problem can be combated.

They warned of ‘catastrophic consequences’ if nothing was done.

Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘There are currently 1.5 million people addicted to prescription drugs in the UK.

‘The abuse of these types of substances is taking place in the shadows and its extent is still unquantified.

‘Local GPs need to report their suspicions and collate information to illuminate this problem.’

Data should be made anonymous to ensure patient confidentiality is protected, the report said.

The cross-party group of MPs concluded: ‘We recommend that medical practices start an anonymous data collection of those patients who have been proven to be, or a medical professional has reasonable suspicion of being, addicted to prescription drugs and how they are being supplied.’

The report also warned that GPs nurses and other health staff could escape prosecution even if they illegally supply prescription drugs.

Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee said: ‘GPs already play a key role in treating patients in the community suffering from the impact of drug addiction.

‘It is a devastating medical condition that ruins lives, families and communities and it is right that we continuously look at how we can improve drug addiction treatment.

‘However, the identification of individuals addicted to prescription drugs is not straight forward and whilst we should do all we can to support their withdrawal from such drugs, we also need to ensure that patients are confident that their sensitive personal data will remain secure.’

Legal highs: Legal high abuse is more significant in suburban and rural areas

Deaths from the drugs - which mimic the effects of banned substances like cocaine and ecstasy but are designed to stay outside the law - have increased by 80 per cent in just a year.

The report warned the problem will get worse and new drugs will continue to emerge unless ‘immediate action’ is taken.

Legal high abuse is more significant in suburban and rural areas, it warned - and called for tougher action to target suppliers.

Ministers have launched a review of the laws governing legal highs.
