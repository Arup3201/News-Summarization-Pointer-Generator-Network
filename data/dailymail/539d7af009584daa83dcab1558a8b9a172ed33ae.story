Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has struck a deal to reinvent the Charles James label – the subject of this year’s Costume Institute exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

A spokesperson for Mr Weinstein confirmed the Miramax co-founder’s ‘partnership’ with James’s relatives to MailOnline this evening.

He has installed his wife and Marchesa co-designer Georgina Chapman, as well as her brother Edward, to come on board as creative consultants.

Sources tell MailOnline that in striking the deal, Mr Weinstein has also partnered with the MET to transport the Costume Institute’s Charles James: Beyond Fashion retrospective – whose opening was feted last evening with the museum’s annual star-studded gala -  around the country as a traveling exhibit.

They said that ‘In taking the exhibit around the country, [Harvey’s] hope is to reinvent Charles James, and bring it back to being a luxury label that stands alongside Oscar de la Renta and Christian Dior.’

It is understood that Mr Weinstein’s ‘partnership’ with Mr James’s relatives is a licensing contract, which will allow him to extensively develop the brand.

Charles James, a British designer who passed away in 1978, was the choice couturier of mid-century American socialites including Babe Pailey, Millicent Rogers, and Austine Hearst.They favored his designs for their swan-appropriate appearance. In utilizing yards of precious fabrics, James was able to create ball gowns that were majestic in texture, shape, and color.But aesthetics aside, the designer himself took a greater pleasure in fashion design's constructional complexities. It allowed him to play with dimension, shadow, and weight - using fabric as the figurative means to a larger experiment.

James's work was a favorite among mid-century American socialites, and is best recalled through this Cecil Beaton photograph, which captures the designer's creations and muses as if they were part of the Eighteenth century French court

The MET’s exhibit showcases James’s interest in construction – using modern technology including robotic cameras and X-ray animations to, somewhat ironically, highlight the inner workings of his gowns’ old-world glamor.

But while his body of work was successful from a cachet perspective, James lacked the extensive business panache required to sustain a fashion label.

Throughout his career, the Charles James brand encountered numerous financial disasters – which forced the designer to embark on multiple licensing deals, a taboo at the time. Due to his many monetary pitfalls, James died penniless and alone – his name as a designer nearly forgotten.

But the MET’s exhibit, which opens to the public on May 8 and runs until August 11, hits a more positive note by focusing on James’s golden period from the Thirties to Sixties.

Luckily, this angle seems to have worked. Chatter surrounding Charles James has been endless since the exhibit’s initial announcement in September – exacerbated by a flood of very public teasers released by the MET, as well as Vogue.

However infinite these promotional efforts may have been, they helped create an opportune time for a revival of the Charles James aesthetic.

The concept of bringing a label back from the dead may have seemed daunting in previous years, but the recent reboot of Schiaparelli– a fabled brand that rose from extinction in 2013 with help from Tod’s CEO Diego Della Valle – made the prospect of an actual James resurgence seem not so far-fetched.

It seemed like only a matter of time before a buyer came forward. And today he did.

In restarting the Charles James label, Mr Weinstein has wife Georgina, the co-designer of Marchesa to help guide the brand’s likely ballgown-heavy ship.

Ms Chapman herself is an avid fan of eveningwear. Her label, which she designs with Keren Craig, is known for its heavily-embellished gowns that are favored by starlets like Blake Lively and Diane Kruger.

Mr Weinstein has a bit of fashion experience himself too. In 2007 he attempted to restart Halston – the iconic label that served as an archetype for the Seventies’ disco fashions.

While accomplished, James (pictured) unfortunately died alone and penniless following years of life in solitude and numerous business fall outs

The project began with good intentions – and an impressive creative team that included Jimmy Choo’s Tamara Mellon and Rachel Zoe – but it never seemed to quite get off the ground.

Following multiple changes in design leadership (which at one point even included Sarah Jessica Parker as chief creative officer) and a lack of financial promise, Mr Weinstein departed the label in 2011.

Coincidentally for Mr Weinstein – or perhaps something of a nightmare - Charles James actually was a mentor to Halston founder Roy Halston in the late Fifties, when he was still an unknown.

The two later presented a joint collection in 1970, which Halston hoped would revive James’s career – one that had already lost steam following numerous financial downturns.

Sadly, the collection was panned, and is said to have permanently soured their friendship.

Hopefully Mr Weinstein’s attempt at resuscitating the Charles James name will result in a more positive outcome.
