A pair 17,000-year-old skeletons have been brought to life by a sculptor who has spent seven years creating silicone models of them by studying their pre-historic bones.

Elisabeth Daynes has created 'Chancelade Man' and the 'Woman of the Pataud Shelter' based on remains found in France's Dordogne region in the 18th millennium BC.

Ms Daynes became an expert in palaeontology after starting out as a make-up artist and creator of masks at the Theatre North in Lille.

The creation by Ms Daynes, right, which was based on studying his bones, shows a grey and balding man with blue eyes and wrinkled skin 

Now she says she gives flesh to the faces and bodies of fossils from all ages of evolution, some from millions of years ago through a collaboration of forensic science, anthropology and art.

The skeleton of the 'Chancelade Man', measuring 188cm tall, was discovered in 1888 in the south-west of the country with a curved posture, below the floor of a rock shelter.

After years of studying casts of the skeleton's skull as well as carrying out detailed anthropometric surveys, Ms Daynes has created a silicone reconstruction of what the man would have looked like.

The bones of the woman were discovered in France's Dordogne region and date back more than 17,000 years 

And the result is a grey and balding looking man with blue eyes and wrinkled skin, who has been created in a pose similar to that of Rodin's 'The Thinker'.

Ms Daynes, who creates he models in her Paris apartment, said: 'My work is done just like a forensic investigation from casts of skulls, which are reconstituted exactly as composite sketches by police.

'These anthropometric surveys deliver a wealth of information such as age and sex.'

As well as the 'Chancelade Man', Ms Daynes has also created a female version of a pre-historic human based on the skeleton of a woman also found in the Dordogne region.

The silicone model shows a woman, who is thought to have died aged 20 with brown eyes and a rounded face.

An exhibition entitled 'Chairs de Orgines' in Bordeaux is where the two silicone models will be on show 

The skin coyote stole worn by the female model is also a close representation of what a pre-historic woman would have worn, although she admits the dreadlocks and skin markings are her artistic impressions.

She explained: 'My art is a synthesis between scientific observation and imagination.'

The models are set to go on show in a exhibition entitled 'Chairs des Origins - our ancestors as you've never seen'.

The exhibition will be displayed at a gallery in Bordeaux until December 5.
