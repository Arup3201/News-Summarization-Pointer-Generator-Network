Care worker June Downer has been jailed for eight months after admitting mistreatment of patients

A former care assistant who systematically abused three vulnerable residents at a nursing home has been jailed for eight months.

A court heard June Downer, 61, who was dismissed from her post in February last year, slapped a 65-year-old woman across the face, smacked a 58-year-old resident with learning difficulties and also hit a Down's Syndrome sufferer.

Prosecutor Paul Reid told Bradford Crown Court that only four of the 17 residents at the Ashfield House nursing home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, were able to communicate and Downer's behaviour towards in 2012 them caused concern among other staff members.

Mr Reid said: 'She would be loud and rough with residents. It is the prosecution's case that she would be violent towards them.'

The court heard how the 65-year-old victim, who was unable to communicate, had been on a day trip when one member of staff jokingly described the resident as being a 'terror'.

Downer then walked over and slapped the woman hard across the face with her open hand as she sat on the toilet, the court heard.

Mr Reid said the woman lost her balance on the toilet and Downer then wagged her finger in her face saying: 'You better behave yourself the next time.'

In a later incident involving the same victim, Downer slapped her hard on the thigh even though the woman was asleep in bed having been sick earlier in the day.

Downer remarked herself that the slap was 'a bit hard' and the court heard that the slap left a hand-print on the complainant's thigh.

On a further occasion, when the same complainant threw herself onto the floor because she did not want to go to day-care, Downer got a wheelchair, grabbed the woman by the back of her trousers and yanked her up before putting her in it.

Most of the residents at Ashfield House nursing home in Bradford were unable to communicate

Mr Reid said as the woman tried to kick her shoes off Downer slapped her on the thigh saying 'keep those shoes on'.

Downer, 61, of Pudsey, West Yorkshire, pleaded guilty last month to three offences of ill-treating residents who lacked mental capacity.

A fourth allegation involving another elderly woman was ordered to lie on the file.

When Downer was questioned by police about the allegations she denied slapping any residents, but could give no reason why other members of staff would say she had.

Her barrister Tony Kelbrick said he could not give any explanation for the offending and Downer herself had no real memory of doing what she had now admitted.

Other members of staff at the home raised concerns about Downer after witnessing her violent abuse

He said: 'This is a lady who has been in the care profession for many years and I have calculated nearly 5,000 days employment in that particular field.'

The court heard that Downer had no previous convictions but Judge Neil Davey QC said the series of offences represented the systematic abuse of elderly and vulnerable people.

He said Downer's actions were a gross breach of the trust placed in her by the victims themselves and their families.

'The facts of these offences themselves are serious enough, but they are made all the more serious by the fact that the people you abused were in your care,' the judge told Downer.

He said she had not shown any remorse and had to jail her as the public needed to be reassured that imprisonment awaited those who chose to ill-treat residents in their care.
