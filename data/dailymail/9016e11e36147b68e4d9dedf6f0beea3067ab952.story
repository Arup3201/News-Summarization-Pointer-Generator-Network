Watchdogs have told discounts website Groupon to clean up its act following a deluge of complaints from disgruntled customers.

The company has been banned from exaggerating the savings promised in its daily voucher deals.

It will also have to make sure that the firms offering discounted goods and services – from fish pedicures to cupcakes – can cope with demand.

In addition, claims made about any 
beauty or health products it promotes will have to be substantiated. A 
system for swift refunds will also be put in place.

The crackdown follows an  
investigation by the Office of Fair Trading, which yesterday announced 
that the company has signed legal undertakings to improve its conduct.

If Groupon fails to make the aforementioned changes within three months, it could face legal action and fines.

The company was referred to the OFT 
by the Advertising Standards Authority, which found evidence that 
customers had been misled by at least 48 deals promoted by Groupon and 
its partners in just 11 months.

The American company acts as a 
middleman for businesses across the country and offers online vouchers 
for their products and services.

It sends more than six million 
British subscribers a list of these offers via email each morning, 
promising both luxuries and essentials at what appear to be bargain 
prices – but the deals are only valid if a certain number of people sign
up.

Some customers have been left 
disappointed by smaller companies who are overwhelmed by demand, while 
others have complained about Groupon exaggerating the size of the 
discounts it offers.

Cavendish Elithorn of the OFT said: 
‘Collective buying and discount schemes can offer real benefits for both
consumers and merchants.

‘The market is growing rapidly, but 
it’s important that consumers benefit from consumer protection law as 
well as from the discounted offers.’

He continued: ‘Groupon has 
co-operated fully with our investigation and is making changes to its 
business practices to address our concerns. We will be monitoring the 
situation closely to ensure that consumers benefit from these 
improvements.’

Groupon said it would willingly implement the changes recommended by the OFT.

‘Many of their suggested changes were already under way, and the rest we will implement with haste,’ it said.

‘To the Groupon customers that 
experienced the negative side effects of our growth: we’re sorry. We 
believe that the only way to build a company that lasts is to provide 
the best customer experience in the world, and it pains us when we fall 
short.

‘Our commitment is this: we are going
to get this right. We won’t stop until we are  known for having the 
best customer service in the UK.’
