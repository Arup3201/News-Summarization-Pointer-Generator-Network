Emma Mullings, 33, from Mascot in Sydney's south east, conquered her battle with depression

On the surface, there was nothing wrong with Emma Mullings.

She was 29 years old, had a supportive husband, two beautiful young children and an established career in the media.

But every day Ms Mullings was fighting the desire to kill herself.

She first realised something was seriously wrong when someone she knew committed suicide and her first thought was 'how did they do it?'

'Then I started Googling to find out more about how she had done it and I think that was the first time I thought "Hang on Emma, this is not cool",' Ms Mullings told Daily Mail Australia.

'But there was something about that point, I was in such a dark place that I thought if someone else can do it I can too.'

Her husband Terrence noticed Ms Mullings was different, but she was too ashamed to talk to him about her depression or tell him how extreme it had gotten.

'I guess I didn't want to say it out loud, I felt like "What's wrong with me, how can I even be having these thoughts?"'

It had been six months of numbness, with Ms Mullings going through the motions at work and taking care of her children without really feeling present.

Then one day at work a little Gmail chat icon popped up on her computer screen.

When Ms Mullings was 29 years old she was constantly fighting the desire to kill herself. The idea of leaving her young children without a mother was the only thing stopping her

'Hey, how are you today?' it read.

It was her friend Tamara McDonald, who she had been close friends with in her early 20s, but had lost touch with since having children.

At first Ms Mullings gave short, cheery but dishonest answers.

'I'm fine,' she would reply.

But Ms McDonald was persistent, and kept checking in with Ms Mullings every day.

'It was pretty random, but if you ask her now she just says she felt like something wasn't right,' she said.

Eventually Ms Mullings' replies became more honest.

In the middle of her depression Ms Mullings' old friend Tamara McDonald asked her how she was out of the blue over Gmail chat

She lied at first, but they kept chatting and over the next four months Ms Mullings eventually told her friend about her suicidal thoughts

'Because she was a chat icon it just felt safer,' she said.

'I think I just started saying things like, actually I'm finding things a bit challenging, sometimes I just feel really flat and I don't want to get out of bed.'

Before long she had become brutally honest, and would say things like: 'I want to die the only thing that's stopping me is how it will affect my children'.

Ms Mullings said up until that point, the idea of leaving her young children without a mother had been the only thing stopping her from acting on her suicidal thoughts.

'My mum died of cancer when I was four, so I was very aware of what that feels like.'

But one night, about four months after Ms Mullings and Ms McDonald first started chatting, she had a dark dream.

'In my dream it was almost like I was making a strategy to commit suicide,' she said.

'Something was there telling me "You can write them a letter explaining that mummy's mind is sick".'

The next day, she spoke to Ms McDonald and told her all about it.

'I was almost excited because finally I had a plan, and I had a way out,' she said.

With her friend's support, Ms Mullings eventually sought counselling and conquered her battle with depression

This was the most serious that Ms Mullings had ever been, and Ms McDonald knew it was time to take action.

'She called my husband and booked me in to see someone,' Ms Mullings said.

'They were all things she was suggesting for ages but she just took the action.'

Ms Mullings started seeing a counsellor, kept talking with her friend, and slowly her suicidal thoughts started to diffuse.

'It takes a lot of energy to push through but I just kept pushing through,' she said.

'I guess with her encouragement I felt like I had a renewed determination.

'I know it might sound weird but I know she had a lot of people praying for me, and it just slowly started to lift.'

She started living a healthier, more active lifestyle and started choosing to banish negative thoughts from her head.

In July 2012, after more than a year of counselling, it was her 31st birthday and Ms Mullings was sitting at a caf√© with some of her closest girlfriends overlooking the beach at Manly when it struck her that she was feeling really positive and strong on the inside.

'That was the first time I thought wow, I actually made it out, I might be on the other side,' she said.

Now 33, she is sharing her story ahead of R U OK Day on Thursday in the hope that she will inspire others who are battling with depression.

'I actually want them to know that they can get better, that it's not permanent,' she said.

'People say you'll always struggle with it and I actually don't believe that, I think you can get 100 per cent healed.'

She also hopes to inspire those who suspect a friend or relative is suffering from depression, because it was so important for her to have someone constantly checking in

She also hopes to inspire those who suspect a friend or relative is suffering from depression, because it was so important for her to have someone constantly checking in.

'Once she cottoned on to what I was going through that she continued to follow up,' Ms Mullings said.

'Now that I'm out of it I feel like that was really clear and strategic, but at the time I was in such a cloud that I wasn't really aware.'

Her advice is to simply start a conversation.

'Make it a safe space for them to be able to talk about how they're feeling,' she said.

'And be patient, even though sometimes it can be frustrating.

'Eventually they will talk if you keep creating the space.'
