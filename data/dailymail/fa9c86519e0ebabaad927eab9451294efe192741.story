A woman has been charged after a 16-year-old boy was killed in a hit-and-run fourth months ago, authorities said.

Dianna Vandyne, 46, was arrested on Thursday after being stopped by state troopers. She was charged with felony hit-and-run and tampering with evidence.

Vandyne is being held in connection with the death of Anthony Weakland. He was killed by a car while walking to his sister's home with a friend on July 17 in Springfield Township, Ohio.

The teenager was thrown around 15 feet in the air by the impact of the vehicle and died in his friend's arms.

Family and friends had pleaded with the driver to come forward at the time of Anthony's death.

John Williams, who is close to the family, told Fox: 'It’s so disrespectful. You couldn’t get out and see if he’s alright, call an ambulance, own up to  your mistakes? It’s wrong.'

Vandyne, of Mogadore, is in Summit County Jail and is due to be arraigned at Akron Municipal Court today.

Court records showed that the 46-year-old had previously been arrested for drug possession and driving under a suspended license.
