Three members of security at the Commonwealth Games have been sacked after taking a photograph with Usain Bolt.

The incident occurred when the Jamaican sprinter was training beside Hampden Park ahead of his country's 4x100m relay heats on Friday night.

Volunteers at the 2014 Glasgow Games have now been warned by supervisors to remain professional at all times, in light of the controversy.

Star attraction: Three Commonwealth Games security staff were sacked for taking 'selfies' with Usain Bolt

Scene of the crime: The incident happened while Bolt was training beside Hampden Park

In addition they have also been told not to approach Bolt or any other athletes for 'selfies' with the competition near to a close.

One volunteer at Hampden told the Evening Standard that this wasn't the first-time that Bolt had been approached by staff asking for a picture with him.

'The [supervisor] was saying we shouldn’t be doing that with out mobile phones,' the volunteer said.

'Everyone was taking photographs of him but these two guys got punted [sacked].'

Bolt, the double 100m, 200m and 4x100m Olympic champion, arrived in Glasgow on Saturday but was thought not to have played any part in the three security guards' dismissal.

A Glasgow 2014 spokeswoman said: 'Sword Security can confirm three members of contract security staff have been removed from roles at Glasgow 2014’s training facilities at Lesser Hampden after breaching conditions of their employment.

'All three are still employed by the company but are no longer working at Glasgow 2014. Sword Security’s polices are designed to ensure the privacy of athletes is fully respected in the lead-up to and during competition.'
