Fish faux-pas: Venezuelan president Nicholas Maduro muddled the word for 'fish' with 'penises'

Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro appeared to make a mistake of Biblical proportions this week - when he muddled a well-known religious quote and said Christ multiplied loaves and 'penises'.

Maduro made the unfortunate error during a speech on education at the Miranda stadium, in the country’s capital, Caracas.

Referring to the iconic story of when Christ multiplied fish and loaves to feed the populace, Maduro said his government would help expand education in the country, 'school by school, child by child, high 
school by high school, community by community — to embed ourselves in 
there.

'To multiply ourselves like Christ multiplied the penises — sorry,
the fish — and the bread.'

The Spanish word for 'penises' (penes) is just one letter away from the word for 'fish' (peces).

The Venezuelan premier, who was dressed in a bright red, blue and yellow Adidas track suit - to reflect the colours of the national flag - immediately sparked a storm among Twitter users.

Sofy Cortez wrote: 'Hahaha so I just read about Nicolas Maduro's speech and Christ did what?!?!? He multiplied "penises"?!?!? God bless!'

Another user, LayNG, wrote: 'Panes + Peces = PENES #EpicFail @NicolasMaduro'.

Maduro took over as interim president of Venezuela following the death of Hugo Chavez on March 5.

He later won an election against the opposition candidate Henrique Capriles.

Despite only being in power for five months, Maduro has courted controversy on more than one occasion.

He has been blamed for a toilet paper shortage throughout the country, apparently slept in Chavez's mausoleum, has made a number of anti-gay slurs and offered asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden.

Maduro also made a lingual faux pas earlier this month when, according to the Latin Times, he incorrectly pronounced the Spanish word for 'millions', making it a feminine noun instead of a masculine noun.
