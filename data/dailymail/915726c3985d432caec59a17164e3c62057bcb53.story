Medical marijuana may soon be available to Orthodox Jews in New York as rabbis work with companies  seeking to sell kosher edibles to Jewish patients in the state.

New York's Orthodox Union is in discussion with companies aiming to provide kosher, edible marijuana products to Jews in the state -- but only those with medical needs, the Jewish Daily Forward reports. 

The medical marijuana is expected to go on sale  next year.

Rabbi Moshe Elefant, COO of the OU’s kosher certification agency, told the Forward that the agency would have no problem certifying medical marijuana because of its clear medical benefits.

Elefant said the OU was approached several weeks ago by a company with marijuana factories in Colorado, where both the medicinal and recreational use of the drug are legal, according to the New York Post. 

Kosher certification is not necessary for the plant itself, according to the Forward, but medical marijuana patients will not be allowed to smoke it due to Health Department regulations in the state where companies are vying for licenses to grow and sell the drug.

Instead, patients will have to ingest it in other ways, such as food, drinks, or capsules, which require kosher certification for Orthodox patients.  

While many Orthodox rabbis seem to accept medical marijuana, the same can not be said for their stance on recreational use of the drug.

Rabbi J. David Bleich, an authority on medical ethics at Yeshiva University in New York, told the Forward that while medical marijuana is 'a perfectly acceptable use of a plant that grows in God’s garden,' recreational use of the drug would be solely for pleasure purposes, and is 'certainly not that to which a Jew should aspire.'

But, he added: 'I can't tell you the 614th mitzvah is thou shalt not smoke pot.' 

This effort marks one of the latest endeavors among Progressive Jews -- as opposed to traditional Orthodox Judaism.

Progression: Many progressive Jews view the legalization of marijuana as a social justice issue arguing that drug policy in the U.S. criminalizes otherwise law-abiding citizens

Ean Seeb, owner of a Denver, Colo. marijuana dispensary, is one of several Jews who pushed for the legalization of marijuana in the state where the drug was legalized in 2012.

'We have shown here in Colorado that you can effectuate social change without the world crashing down on you,' Seeb said.

He compared the Jewish involvement in marijuana activity to that of its involvement in the civil rights movements of the 1960s and prohibition in the alcohol industry, according to Forward.

Many Progressive Jews view the legalization of marijuana as a social justice issue arguing that drug policy in the U.S. criminalizes otherwise law-abiding citizens.

Marijuana is legal in nearly half of the U.S. and a handful of states allow recreational use of the drug as well.
