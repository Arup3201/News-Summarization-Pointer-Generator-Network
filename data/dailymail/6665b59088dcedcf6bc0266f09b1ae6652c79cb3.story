There won't be any trick-or-treating in the northeastern Pennsylvania area where authorities continue searching for a suspect accused of killing a state trooper.

Officials in rural Barrett Township in Pennsylvania canceled the beloved Halloween ritual and the annual parade because of the police manhunt for Eric Frein.

But kids did get to 'trunk or treat' over the weekend. The event held at a school parking lot included candy, a costume contest and car trunks decorated for the spooky holiday.

Still at large: Frein (left and right), a self-taught survivalist, allegedly used a rifle to open fire outside the state police barracks on September 12, killing Corporal Bryan Dickson and wounding Trooper Alex Douglass

Organizers called it a success, saying hundreds of children and adults attended. 

Still, Halloween parade chairwoman Betty Oppelt says the community is missing a major tradition this year.

Frein is charged with opening fire outside the Blooming Grove barracks on September 12, killing Trooper Bryon Dickson and seriously wounding Trooper Alex Douglass. 

The search for Frein - who allegedly used a high-powered rifle to open fire outside the state police barracks on September 12 - has reached its 48th day. 

Frein was identified as a suspect in the barracks shooting on September 16 after his disabled SUV was found abandoned a mile away, according to The Morning Call.

Officials believe the self-taught survivalist - who allegedly prepared for the ambush and his escape for months - is hiding out in the woods on the border of Pike and Monroe Counties.

Although hundreds of families attended the 'trunk or treat' event, Halloween parade chairwoman Betty Oppelt says the community is missing a major tradition this year because a killer is still on the loose

Hundreds of state police and federal agents have been involved in the widespread, intensive search that reportedly continues to exceed $1million a week. 

On September 21, investigators discovered a gun belonging to him. The search team has largely shut down the area near Canadensis, Pennsylvania, where he lived with his parents.

Although a 'shelter in place' order has been lifted for residents, citizens have been urged to avoid the woods and take caution when outside of their homes.

Law enforcement officers wearing bulletproof vests and armed with rifles can still be seen marching the streets, while unmarked helicopters regularly fly overhead.

Frein belonged to the rifle team at Pocono Mountain High School, and as an adult joined a group that performed military re-enactments of Eastern European conflicts in the modern era. 

He even played a small role in a 2007 movie about a concentration camp survivor - earning him a mention in the movie database IMDb - and helped with props and historical references on a documentary about World War I.

'He was a very friendly guy to me,' said Jeremy Hornbaker, who hired him for the documentary. 'We left on very good terms.'

Frein's father, retired Army Major E. Michael Frein, told police that he had taught his son to shoot.

He 'doesn't miss,' the father told state police during a search of the family home, when he also disclosed that an AK-47 and a .308 rifle with a scope were missing. 

A copy of the book, 'Sniper Training and Employment,' was found in his bedroom.

Frein had for a time attended nearby East Stroudsburg University and held a number of jobs over the years but never any for very long, authorities said.

Police have not yet determined what may have led to the suspect's apparent hatred of police.
