For cyclists wanting to be seen among the traffic in a big city, it’s a unique solution - putting a large roadsign on their back.

The Seil backpack allows cyclists to trigger a range of displays, including indicators, stop signs and even their own custom messages for particularly irritating drivers.

Commands are triggered via a Bluetooth controller on the handlebar and can be designed with a special mobile phone app.

Designer Lee Myungsu has been working on the bags since 2010, which he designed to try and make the roads a safer place for cyclists. The bags show the intentions of a cyclist as well as warning signs and messages

‘The Seil Bag is designed in order to illustrate traffic signals such as the cruise signal, stop signal and emergency signal directly on the backpack,’ says Lee Myungsu, the Korean designer behind the project.

He has been developing the idea since 2010, and has now launched a Kickstarter project to put it into production after winning a major design award.

It uses a specially developed flexible LED display Mungsu says is also waterproof, so should survive British weather.

It will be available as both a backpack and a bum bag and both can be used for maximum effect.

He hopes it will be used to make cycling safer, but admits the design can also be used to transmit fun messages and even emoticons to passers by.

The bumbag will cost $199, and the rucksack $299
