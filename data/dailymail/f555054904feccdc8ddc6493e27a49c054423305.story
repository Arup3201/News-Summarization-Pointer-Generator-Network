At first glance, it looks like any other F-16 fighter jet - except for one difference.

Boeing's new QF-16 is a actually a retired US Air force jet converted into a drone.

The pilotless plane can be controlled from the ground, and will used for target practice by 'top gun' pilots.

Where's the pilot? Boeing has revealed video footage of an F-16 jet converted into a drone.

126 of the converted planes will be used by the US Air Force as flying targets to train top gun pilots.

Length: 49 ft, 5 in.

Span: 32 ft, 8 in.

Takeoff weight: 37,500 lbs

Max speed: 1,500 mph

Max altitude: 50,000 ft plus

Range: 2,425 mi

Engine: One 27,000-lb-thrust Pratt & Whitney F100 

The first production Boeing QF-16 optionally manned target drone has been delivered to the US Air Force (USAF), Air bosses have revealed. 

Aircraft QF-007 arrived at Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida on 11 March, ahead of being pressed into service by the 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron (ATS).

Boeing has delivered six pre-production QF-16s, and in all, the USAF expects to receive 126 QF-16s.

The unmanned McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II currently used is no longer truly representative of the air-to-air threats USAF pilots are likely to encounter on future operations.

The QF-16 will be able to represent threats in the class of the MiG-29 'Fulcrum' and Sukhoi Su-27 'Flanker', bosses say.

In tests, two U.S. Air Force test pilots in a ground control station at Tydall remotely flew the QF-16, which is a retired F-16 jet modified to be an aerial target. 

While in the air, the QF-16 mission included a series of simulated maneuvers, reaching supersonic speeds, returning to base and landing, all without a pilot in the cockpit.

'It was a little different to see it without anyone in it, but it was a great flight all the way around,' said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Ryan Inman, Commander, 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron. 

'It's a replication of current, real world situations and aircraft platforms they can shoot as a target. Now we have a 9G capable, highly sustainable aerial target.'

For more than 40 years, the F-16 Fighting Falcon has proven itself as the world's most capable 4 generation multi-role fighter, serving as the workhorse of the fighter fleet for 28 customers around the world. 

The drones have been adapted from F-16 jets that have been retired by the Air Force.

For more than 40 years, the F-16 Fighting Falcon has proven itself as the world's most capable 4 generation multi-role fighter, serving as the workhorse of the fighter fleet for 28 customers around the world. 

The F-16's most innovative design feature is its 'fly-by-wire' control system, the first on any aircraft.

The F-16 is designed to maneuver at up to nine g's. 

This allows it to turn tighter than other fighters, a big advantage in a dogfight. But at such high g-loadings, the pilot is crushed down into his seat by almost a ton of force, and can barely lift a finger. 

So the F-16 has a small side-mounted control stick on an armrest. Instead of moving back and forth, the F-16's fixed joystick responds to hand pressure. 

In a tight, high-g turn, an otherwise immobilized F-16 pilot can literally fly with the twitch of a finger.
