The humble hot dog - we know it as the cheap snack you can pick up for a few dollars on the street or during half-time at a baseball game.

So you might be more than a little shocked if you decided to buy one from a food van in Seattle, only to be charged $169 (£102).

The Junni Ban is what you might call a haute dog, and is the creation of Japanese food fusion specialists Tokyo Dog.

World's dearest dog: Tokyo Dog's Junni Ban costs $169 and is topped with truffles, caviar and foie gras

The mouthwatering foot-long smoked cheese bratwurst is topped with butter teriyaki grilled onions, maitake mushrooms, wagyu beef, foie gras, shaved black truffles, caviar and Japanese mayonnaise, all served up in a brioche bun. 

Chefs need two weeks notice to order and prepare the ingredients, yet despite this and the hefty price tag, five people have already jumped at the chance to sample the world's dearest dog. 

Tokyo Dog owner Eugene Woo told local media: 'It's an amazing hot dog - it is savoury and tastes fabulous.

'We didn't want to just throw together a load of ingredients, but instead put some real research into it. There was a lot of trial and error to make it a really awesome hot dog.

'So far our buyers have loved it.'

Along with fellow creators Samson Kwong and Rocky Weh, it took Mr Woo a year to perfect the gourmet hot dog.

Alan Chang from California was the first to fork out for it, and with four others also buying, the Junni Ban has so far brought in $845 (£510) for the Red Cross, where all proceeds are being donated to.

It has been crowned the most expensive on the planet by Guinness World Records, beating the previous record by $23.51 (£14).

Mr Woo said: 'The previous record was $145.49, and we thought it would be fun to break that record.

'But it is also for fundraising. We gave away every single penny to the Red Cross.'

Although the Junni Ban is officially recognised by Guinness as the world's most expensive hot dog, that does not mean it actually is.

Many restaurants decide not to go through the hassle of submitting their dishes for records, as the process can be long and expensive.

Tokyo Dog sent their evidence in, including photos and videos,  back on February 23, but only now has the record been recognised.

In 2012, New York's 230 Fifth restaurant released a $2,300 creation made out of 60-day dry-aged wagyu and topped with vidalia onions caramelized in Dom Perignon, caviar and sauerkraut braised in Cristal.

Hot dogs are not the only fast food which have been given expensive makeovers for the famous Guinness book - the world's most expensive pizza can be found at Gordon Ramsey's Maze restaurant in London and costs  £100.

The thin-crust, wood fire-baked pizza is topped with onion puree, white truffle paste, fontina cheese, baby mozzarella, pancetta, cep mushrooms, freshly picked wild mizuna lettuce and garnished with fresh shavings of a rare Italian white truffle, itself worth a whopping £1,400 per kilogram.
