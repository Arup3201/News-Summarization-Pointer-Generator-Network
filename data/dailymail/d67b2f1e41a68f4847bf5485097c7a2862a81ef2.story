A New York tattoo artist has died after he attempted to surf an elevator, according to reports.

Tito Morales, 20, was unconscious when he was found wedged between the elevator car and the wall of the shaft at an apartment block in the Longwood neighborhood of the Bronx on Monday morning.

Police told the New York Post that the man, who was heading to pick up some cigarettes after visiting his girlfriend in the building, might have been riding on top of the elevator to 'surf' it when something went wrong.

Killed: Tito Morales, 20, was found wedged between an elevator car and the wall of the elevator shart in an apartment block in the Bronx in the early hours of Monday. He was pronounced dead at the scene

Morales tried to jump from the top of one elevator to another when he misjudged the distance and became stuck between the 18th and 19th floors, sources told Sky News.

Emergency services were called to the grisly scene around 4am on Monday. They managed to pull Morales out from the shaft but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Medical Examiner will determine cause of the death and investigators are still trying to determine exactly how he entered the shaft.

Other residents told the Post that the elevator was unreliable and often became stuck.

About 30 people gathered to see the body being taken out of at the Adams Houses as friends and family hugged each other and sobbed, the New York Daily News reported.

One woman was screaming, 'Mi niño! Mi niño!' ('My child! My child!') as others tried to calm her.

Evangelita Presinal, 22, said she had 
just visited Morales' girlfriend, Joann Sanchez, who lives with her two 
children in the building.

Humble: Morales, who loved tattooing, had just been visiting his girlfriend in the block when he was killed on Monday morning. Police sources said he had been surfing the elevator when something went wrong

Concerns: Other residents said that the elevators in the Bronx building, pictured, were always unreliable

'I just came from her house. She's devastated,' Presinal said. 'He was just a humble person, stuck to himself.'

She added that Morales, who went by the nickname 'Bebo', loved his work as a tattoo artist and had tattooed her brother.

His Facebook page shows tattoos he completed on himself as well as numerous pictures of body art he completed on others.

His older brother mourned the loss of Morales on his own Facebook page, writing: 'Feelin like iam in a dream... God wake me up when u readyy .. Please tell me u aint take my lil brother from mee !! '
