An OAP ended his life with a sawn-off shotgun because he found a disease that left him feeling like he was ‘drowning’ in his own bodily fluids too much to bear.

Michael Durrant, 73, from mid-Wales, suffered from an extremely rare medical condition called Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), which left him housebound.

Aberystwyth coroner’s court heard that MCS caused him to feel as though he was ‘drowning’ in his own body fluids if he came into any kind of contact with substances like smoke, perfume or shampoo.

Hearing: A coroner's court in Aberystwyth heard that Michael Durrant killed himself after finding his rare condition, which left him feeling like he was drowning, too much to bear

He was found dead with a gunshot wound in a layby on a quiet country road earlier this year.

In a heartbreaking note left to his wife, Mr Durrant, from Llechgron, near Aberystwyth, wrote: 'My life is not worth living. Clearly this decision is not one that I can take with equanimity.

'I’m heartbroken, and weeping with grief.'

The inquest heard how a passing motorist, Eifion Jones, spotted a red Volkswagen Golf in the layby of the B4577 near Bethania, at around 7.45am on January 12 as he was on his way to work.

Mr Durrant’s body was lying behind the car - which was owned by his wife - and there was a sawn-off shotgun on the ground nearby, prompting Mr Jones to call the police.

Another witness, Vicky Sweetland, noted that Mr Durrant had 'extensive' injuries to his head.

Pc Nia Owen, from Lampeter Police Station, told the inquest that she had been called out to the scene and found a packet addressed to the police and coroner, along with a USB memory stick.

Multiple Chemical Sensitivity is an unusually severe sensitivity or allergy-like reaction to many different kinds of pollutants including solvents, VOC's (Volatile Organic Compounds), perfumes, petrol, diesel, smoke, 'chemicals' in general and often encompasses problems with regard to pollen, house dust mites, and pet fur. 

What sets an MCS patient apart from other allergy sufferers is that they react to both large and minuscule levels of irritants.

Sometimes these levels are so low that others are completely unaware that there's anything potentially troublesome in the vicinity.

Multiple chemical sensitivity - unlike true allergies where the underlying mechanisms of the problem are relatively well understood and widely accepted- is generally regarded as 'idiopathic' - meaning that it has no known mechanism of causation and its processes are not fully understood.

She added: 'The gun was registered to Mr Durrant.

'The scene was examined and at approximately 8.53am armed response officers attended his home address.

'Mrs Durrant was asleep in bed and was unaware that he had left at all. There was a letter left in the house, identical to the one found in the car, as well as a letter to Mrs Durrant.

'The letter was about his illnesses. Christine Durrant explained about the circumstances leading up to his disappearance and said he was behaving normally the day before, although he was agitated and was downloading things from his computer.

'He had intended to walk around the block and Mrs Durrant requested that she go with him, but he declined.'

Recording a verdict of suicide, Ceredigion coroner Peter Brunton said: 'How he had borne these difficulties for so long is very difficult to comprehend, and it’s remarkable that he carried on for so long.'

Addressing Mrs Durrant, he added: 'I can only marvel at the fortitude with which you both bore these difficulties for so long.'
