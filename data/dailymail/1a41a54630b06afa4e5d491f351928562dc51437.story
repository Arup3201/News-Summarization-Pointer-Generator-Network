A Sydney financial director who allegedly stole more than $7 million from his company has finally run out of luck.

Jason Graham Boatwright is accused of swindling millions from his former employers, online payment service epay while based in Sydney, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. 

The 38-year-old had been on the run for three years, but thanks to the perseverance of NSW Police, the FBI and Fraud Risk Management Service he was arrested in Los Angeles last week. 

It all allegedly began when Boatwright fraudulently deposited epay cheques worth nearly $150,000 in February 2011.

Police allege he then allegedly took a total of $7,120,769 by moving it to his personal bank account in five instalments between May and October that same year. Online betting agency Centrebet accounts allegedly showed Boatwright gambled and lost more than $5 million of this.

The police claim he carried out the crime by having an authorised signatory to approve the payment of accounts to regular suppliers. 

After losing millions gambling Boatwright transferred $300,000 from his ANZ account to the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas

Court documents allege Mr Boatwright began his stealing spree by writing three epay Australia company cheques to the value of $138,475.

He then deposited the cheques into his personal Westpac bank account without detection.

After this he transferred $9,865  through the company's payroll system straight into his regular bank account.

Boatwright is also wanted in Britain for allegedly defrauding Red Bull while he worked for them in London

Police will allege these thefts were just for starters as Boatwright went back to the company's coffers for a multimillion-dollar feast.

Court documents allege the former employee organised for five fraudulent electronic transfers totalling $7,120,769 to go into his personal bank account. 

Online betting agency Centrebet documents allegedly showed that Boatwright gambled away and lost more than $5 million between June 7 and November 5, 2011.

It is alleged that Boatwright fled to Las Vegas after transferring money there from Australia

Police allege that Boatwright panicked after losing these millions and transferred $300,000 from his ANZ account to the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, on November 15, 2011.

The following day he did not show up for work and immigration records confirm he flew out of Sydney to the US.

On Saturday morning he arrived back in Australia and was escorted from Sydney International Airport by two police officers.

Boatwright was refused bail before Parramatta Bail Court later that day after being charged with nine counts of dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception.

He is also wanted in Britain to face claims of fraud against Red Bull for whom he worked in London. 

He is next expected to appear before Central Local Court in late January. 

Epay provides an electronic payment service to more than 23,000 Australian retailers. 

It's unknown how much money Boatwright lost in Las Vegas, but in Australia he allegedly gambled away $5 million
