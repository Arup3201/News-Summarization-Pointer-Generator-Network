Detained: Patrick Rock, a key adviser to David Cameron and deputy director of the No 10 policy unit, resigned and was arrested almost three weeks ago

Downing Street was last night facing allegations of a cover-up over the child porn arrest of one of David Cameron’s oldest friends.

Patrick Rock, 62, deputy director of the No 10 policy unit, resigned and was arrested almost three weeks ago.

But Downing Street said nothing, only choosing to confirm his arrest and departure after being questioned on Monday by the Daily Mail.

Not even senior ministers had been informed.

Officials yesterday confirmed Mr Rock had also previously been the subject of a formal sexual harassment complaint understood to involve a high-flying woman civil servant.

She moved out of No 10 to another department after the case had been examined by Mr Cameron’s chief of staff Ed Llewellyn.

Yesterday, Labour insisted it was extraordinary that a senior figure could resign in such circumstances without any public announcement.

No 10 faced also awkward questions about why Mr Rock was confronted with the child pornography allegations and allowed to quietly resign hours before the police were called in.

Incredibly, outside Mr Cameron’s close circle, only Home Secretary Theresa May was informed of Mr Rock’s resignation.

On a dramatic day in the affair:

Downing Street was first made aware of a potential offence on February 12, when the matter was apparently brought to Mr Cameron’s attention.

Mr Rock – who has been closely involved in drawing up Government policy on internet porn filters – resigned later that day and was reported to the National Crime Agency. He was arrested at his home in West London in the early hours of February 13.

Police were also invited into Downing Street to examine IT systems and the office used by Mr Rock.

The senior No 10 aide quizzed by police over child porn offences has also faced a serious sexual harassment allegation, it was confirmed last night.

Until now Downing Street has  refused to comment.

Patrick Rock was accused by a woman civil servant who worked on major matters of government policy.

Highest level: David Cameron's chief of staff Ed Llewellyn treated the case of Mr Rock's alleged sexual harassment of female colleague 'very seriously'

The woman is understood to be younger than Mr Rock and has worked across Whitehall.

However, in another example of the secrecy surrounding the Rock affair, officials have refused to say when the complaint was made and what the details of her allegations were.

But, such was the sensitivity of the case, it was treated ‘very seriously’ by David Cameron’s chief of staff Ed Llewellyn.

It is understood the woman  has now transferred to another Whitehall department following consultation with Mr Rock. The allegation is not, however, thought to be  related in any way to Mr Rock’s arrest.

The woman’s identity is known to this newspaper but is not being published to protect  her privacy.

Officials yesterday flatly refused to discuss any of the details  of the claim against Mr Rock  and whether he faced any  formal censure.

Last night No 10 dismissed rumours that the complainant had been unhappy with the handling of the case.

A spokesman insisted it had been ‘appropriately resolved’ with the ‘consent and in consultation with the individual that raised the issue’.

‘I can confirm that a complaint around alleged inappropriate behaviour was raised.

‘The matter was dealt with very seriously at senior levels in  full accordance with the Cabinet Office’s human resources  policy,’ the Prime Minister’s spokesman said.

Asked why it had taken so long for No 10 to come clean about the resignation of such a senior aide, Mr Cameron said: ‘First of all, I have to be careful what I say about this issue because there is a criminal investigation underway.

From yesterday's Mail

'Obviously when I heard these allegations I was profoundly shocked and I remain profoundly shocked. 

‘In terms of the release of this information, I do not think it would be right to pre-emptively speak about a criminal investigation and that is why we did not do that.

'As questions were asked and as questions will inevitably be asked, we have given very full and straightforward answers, which is absolutely the right way to handle this situation.

‘I’ve been clear right along, when I was first told about this issue – pretty much as soon as it was discovered – that we must handle this in absolutely the correct way.

'I am satisfied that this is what No 10 has done. He did play an important role at Downing Street.’

'I have to be careful what I say': David Cameron, left, said he was 'profoundly shocked' by the allegations. But Labour MP Tom Watson, right, said the PM cannot just bury his head in the sand and hope the issue goes away

A senior Labour source said Mr Rock’s departure was ‘clearly in the public interest’ and questions were being asked about ‘whether Downing Street sat on this information in order to exploit what was happening with Harriet Harman’.

Miss Harman has faced controversy in recent weeks over links between a civil liberties organisation she used to work for and a paedophile group.

A Labour source said questions had been asked about whether No10 'sat on' information to exploit the outcry over Harriet Harman's links to PIE

Tom Watson, a senior Labour MP who is 
calling for a public inquiry into child abuse allegations, said: ‘I 
fully understand No 10 has a duty of care to a former staff member who 
hasn’t yet been charged. People expect answers to their legitimate 
questions though.

'Did Mr Rock go through developed vetting [for security clearance]? Why did he appear to have advance notice of police involvement? Mr Cameron cannot put his head in the sand and hope this goes away.’

Mr Rock has yet to comment on the allegations against him, and has not been charged with any offence.

A Downing Street source said: ‘Any decision to proactively announce the arrest is clearly a matter for the National Crime Agency.

'It would have been completely inappropriate for us to have ignored the police and made such an announcement, not least because it might have jeopardised the investigation.’

Mr Cameron and Mr Rock worked together as special advisers to Michael Howard in his time as home secretary in the mid-1990s. Mr Rock later worked for Lord Patten during his time as a European commissioner in Brussels. The Prime Minister brought him back into government in 2011.

In the policy unit, Mr Rock helped broker a deal with internet firms which means millions of households are being asked if they want family friendly filters to screen out porn from their computers.
