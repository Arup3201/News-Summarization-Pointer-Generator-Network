A 17-year-old Instagram photographer spends less time snapping selfies and more time taking breath-taking and often illegal views of New York City.

Humza Deas, 17, spoke with New York Magazine about the growing popularity of urban exploration, the incriminating drive to take the perfect photograph of New York City, and about receiving death threats for speaking with the media.

Deas and other Instagram outlaws, namely one named Last Suspect, compete against one another for followers and frighteningly gritty urban snapshots.

Urban explorer: Humza Deas is most known for climbing New York's bridges

New heights: Last Suspect also spends his free time scaling bridges and skyscrapers to take the perfect photograph

Walking the line: Climbing to the top of buildings is bothe dangerous and illegal but that's what makes urban explorers who they are

Deas has 31,000 followers just trailing behind last Suspect's 51,000.

New York magazine explains that both Deas and last Suspect are part of a group of Instagram users called a 'K' or someone with over 10,000 followers so that the last letter of the number of followers is replaced with a K.

Not only do they shoot alike, they dress alike and can be seen wearing photographer's backpack's and Nike shoes so that they can climb the tallest building or even scale the top of a bridge.

Two other well-known Instagram outlaws go by the name of demidism and Konstenn and their work reflects the same adventurous  qualities.

New York Magazine says urban exploration is no new trend. Adventure seekers have long been trespassing onto New York's most coveted landscapes.

Instead of merely observing the structures, however, modern urban exploration has taken the social media trend with it and is becoming more and more about taking the perfect photograph than secretly enjoying city views.

Urban Instagrammers are more like graffiti artists than they are the urban explorers of a decade ago.

Instead of thriving on just an experience, they photograph the structures and leave their mark by posting a photo on Instagram--or leaving a little something to remember them by.

Deas' name blew up on July 22 after a mysterious someone changed American flags on the Brooklyn Bridge to big white flags.

Deas, who is known for scaling bridges, didn't change the flags but woke up to thousands of messages from fans asking him if it was him.

In reality two German artists Mischa Leinkauf and Matthias Wermke changed the flags and admitted it to the New York Times this week.

Deas publicly said that he didn’t change the flags but the stunt got Deas an interview nonetheless.

Deas' friend Neil cuts the hair of a WPIX reporter who wanted to do an interview with an Instagram bridge-climber.

Deas told the reporter the best time to scale bridges is at night and he mentioned his Instagram rival Last Suspect who he said jokingly took credit for the flag prank.

He then shared a snap of Last Suspect with the words 'you shouldn't take credit for someone else's work.'

Last Suspect asked his followers to later boycott Deas and Deas received death threats.

People accused Deas of trying to sneak his way to the top of Instagram fame by exposing coveted secrets.

Believe it or not, Deas didn't start scaling buildings until earlier this year after seeing a video of Russian daredevils climbing a 2,073-foot Shanghai Tower.

'I was like, damn, this is so dangerous,' he said of seeing the video for the first time.

New York magazine explains how it was so dangerous he wanted to try it out on his own.

'I’m thinking, Hey, they’re in China, they’re not in New York...I can show New York this kind of photography.'

In April, Deas made the decision to climb the Brooklyn side of the Williamsburg Bridge. It only took him 15 minutes.

He went on to climb the Queensboro Bridge, Hell Gate Bridge, and the Manhattan Bridge, and the Williamsburg Bridge another six times.

He later advanced to climbing New York's tallest skyscrapers.

Though Deas walks the narrow bridge between legal and illegal, he seldom gets caught and has a plan for when he does.

Deas once got caught photographing a girl from the 53-floor Eventi Skyscraper on Seventh Avenue.

When cops arrived, Deas told them he had a New York State Regents exam the next day and so the police let him off with a warning.

'I knew he wouldn't arrest me because I had a test in the morning,' Deas quipped.

'He's a dad.'

New York Magazine reports that Deas has been trying tom keep a low profile following the white flag incident.

As he and a reporter passed the Manhattan Bridge he said, 'If I really wanted to, I could do it,'

'The NYPD is not superhuman.'
