A man kicked and crushed to death a 6-pound Yorkshire Terrier that ran from her owner and now claims it was self defense and police agree with him.

Precious, a 6-year-old toy Yorkie, got loose from owner Donna Limbaugh, 72, while she was reading the newspaper in front of her home and ran down their Olathe, Kansas street.

He began barking at Limbaugh’s neighbor Carl Henrichson and his much larger Labrador when Henrichson launched him four feet into the air with a swift kick and then crushed him under his boots.

Self-defense? A man stepped on and killed this 6-pound Yorkie named Precious and claims it was in self-defense and in defense of his Labrador

A tearful Limbaugh recounted her side of events to KSHB:

‘He put his foot on her and then he raised the other foot so that he actually stood on her. It actually reminded me of if you were going to step on a bug.’

While they both agree that Henrichson stepped on the dog, Henrichson claims he did so on accident.

But Precious’s injures might tell a different tale.

Aggrieved: Donna Limbaugh says neighbor Carl Henrichson kicked her Yorkie and stomped her with both feet but police gave her a citation, not Henrichson

‘I picked her up. She was crying, screaming, making these terrible noises,’ Limbaugh said. ‘[She was] having trouble breathing and he said to me: Donna, you need to have better control of your dog.’

Precious was taken to veterinarians with lung and brain injuries and later died.

Henrichson also blamed Limbaugh when he, too, was interviewed by KSHB.

‘It was an extremely unfortunate incident’ he said. ‘But if Ms. Limbaugh had had her dog on a leash, her dog wouldn't have attacked my dog, wouldn't have attempted to bite my dog and frankly you and I wouldn't even be talking today.’

Didn't mean to: Carl Henrichson says Precious was a nuisance dog and does not deny stomping her, but says it was an accident

Police investigated the incident, reports KCTV, and they too are blaming the aggrieved Limbaugh.

Olathe police issued her citations for not having a license, not having her dog on a leash, and nuisance violation.

Now neighbors are taking sides and filing police reports, some in support of Henrichson and others supporting Limbaugh.

Limbaugh, meanwhile, will file a restraining order against Henrichson and says she no longer feels safe in the neighborhood.

Though Limbaugh does not deny her dog ran toward Henrichson, she does deny there was any way he truly believed 6-pound Precious was a threat.

‘Precious was little, sweet…loving,’ Limbaugh said. ‘She was my baby.’

Unsafe: Limbaugh has set up a this memorial on the sidewalk where Precious was fatally injured. She says she no longer feels safe in the neighborhood and intends to get a restraining order against Henrichson
