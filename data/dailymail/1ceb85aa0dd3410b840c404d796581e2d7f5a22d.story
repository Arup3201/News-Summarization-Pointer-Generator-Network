Aliens have arrived and they've challenged us to a game of football. Don't panic... it's purely a hypothetical scenario, spectacularly depicted in this new all-star advert.

The world best players - along with Victor Moses and Bolton's Lee Chung-Yong - have been summoned to defend Earth as part of the Samsung Galaxy XI.

VIDEO: Scroll down to see the spectacular advert featuring Messi and Ronaldo

Picked: Real Madrid superstar Ronaldo walks away from his game of volleyball against five girls after being called up

Lionel Messi is Captain Planet, stopped on his morning run in Barcelona by an entourage of blacked-out vehicles with the team's manager, Franz Beckenbauer handing him the armband.

And his strike partner? Cristiano Ronaldo.

The Real Madrid man may well eclipse the Argentine superstar as the No 1 footballer in the world next month.

Manager: Franz Beckenbauer

The former Manchester United star is the favourite to be named winner of the prestigious Ballon d'Or award for the first time in his career, that would deny Messi a fifth consecutive crown.

Ronaldo cuts short a game of foot-volleyball in the video to accept his invitation.

And he is reunited in the team with Wayne Rooney.

The England striker is shown sparring in the ring, landing some heavy blows on his opponent.

But his rival is handed some respite from a barrage of punches when the United ace is interrupted by a call from Germany legend Beckenbauer.

The 28-year-old celebrates his inclusion as the only English player in the line-up wildly.

Tested: Zenit's Aleksandr Kerzhakov and LA Galaxy's Landon Donovan are put through their paces

'It's a great honour to be selected for the team alongside some of the world’s greatest football players,' said Rooney. 

'Hopefully I'll be able to bring my qualities and English spirit to the team and 2014 is going to be a huge year for me with club, country and now the GALAXY 11, so keep watching.'  

Rooney's not the only Premier League star in the line-up, however. Chelsea playmaker Oscar is playing darts in a pub before he is picked. And Liverpool loanee Victor Moses muscles in too (presumably because he is standing with the Brazilian).

Although to be completely fair to Nigeria international Moses, he is an African Nations Cup champion and an ambassador for technology giants Samsung, who sponsor his parent club Chelsea.

Monaco forward Falcao completes the fearsome attack while there's room too for former Everton man Landon Donavan and Bayern Munich's Mario Gotze.

China midfielder Wu Lei and Bolton winger Chung-Yong are also selected, along with Russia forward Aleksandr Kerzhakov and AC Milan's Stephan El Shaarawy - who is another attacker.

On paper, it seems that Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas will have his work cut out against the intergalactic opposition.

Perhaps they'll play Rooney at centre-half...
