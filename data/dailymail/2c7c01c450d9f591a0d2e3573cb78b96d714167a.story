Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been mocked online after he posted a cringeworthy snap of him and 'true friend' Japanese leader Shinzo Abe posing in front of a giant tyre in Western Australia's Pilbara region.

The embarrassing tourist-like snap shows Mr Abbott and Mr Abe standing with one leg up, a hand on their left knees, goggles on their eyes and a big grin on their faces, as they show off their shiny RM Williams boots.

The photo comes after Mr Abbott was accused of being hungover on live TV after he spent the night drinking wine with Mr Abe at a formal dinner at Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday night.

Cringe: Posted a snap of him and 'true friend' Japanese leader Shinzo Abe posing in front of a giant tyre in Western Australia's Pilbara region

The pair were celebrating after signing agreements to boost trade and defence ties between Australia and Japan.

Continuing their blossoming bromance on Wednesday, they stopped by Rio Tinto's 'Mine of the future' project - a joint Japanese-Australian venture - at West Angelas.

They gleefully stood in front of the Komatsu 930E hauling truck tyre and Mr Abbott then posted the cheesy photo on Twitter.

He wrote: 'PM Abe wearing his gift from Australia - RM Williams boots. Both proud to be wearing them today #RMs.'

Stop the boots: Parodies of Mr Abbott striking the same pose on an asylum seeker boat sprang up online

Twitter users responded in disbelief.

'I have no idea what putting a leg up on that yellow bar achieves, it serves no useful purpose,' Marc Fearby wrote.

Emma Belfield, responded: 'Good grief, Tone.'

Rupert H joked Mr Abe said: 'Why is this strange awkward man making me do this.'

And Peter Taggart tweeted US president Barack Obama, joking: 'This could be you at the G20 if you play your cards right.'

Parodies of Mr Abbott striking the same pose in other situations also sprang up online.

Poking fun at his highly criticised 'moral blackmail' comment about an asylum seekers' suicide attempt, one photo showed Mr Abbott attempting to sink a boat full of asylum seekers with his foot with the caption 'stop the boots!'.

On Wednesday it was reported that a dozen mothers have tried to kill themselves on Christmas Island after deciding their children would have more chance of making it to Australia without them.

Mr Abbott responded to the report on Channel Nine News saying: 'No Australian government should be subjected to the spectacle of people saying 'unless you accept us, I am going to commit self harm','

'I don't believe any thinking Australian would want us to capitulate to moral blackmail.

'This is not going to be a government which has our policy driven by people who are attempting to hold us over a moral barrel â€“ we won't be driven by that.'

Mr Abbott also refused to say where a group of 153 asylum seekers were being held by Australian authorities, or whether they will be returned to Sri Lanka.

Mr Abe's trip Down Under is the first bilateral visit by a Japanese leader to Australia in 12 years.

And Japan and Australia are officially even better friends thanks to the vist, after the PMs swapped compliments at an official dinner in Perth on Wednesday.

Mr Abbott said the partnership with Japan had deepened in extraordinary ways in the past few days.

He said Mr Abe was his friend.

'But more importantly I can say with certainty and confidence that Japan is Australia's true friend and that Australia is Japan's true friend. We should never set limits on what we can achieve,' he said at the dinner.

Done deal: Tony Abbott and Mr Abe signed agreements to boost trade and defence ties between Australia and Japan

Mr Abbott said he and Mr Abe had seen what had been achieved in their visit to the Pilbara.

'I look forward to Australia and Japan marching together into the future,' he said.

Mr Abe said he was much impressed with the vast size of Australia and the five hours it took to fly from Canberra to Western Australia.

'I was able to discuss a lot of topics with Mr Abbott and so five hours I think even made both countries' relationship much closer,' he said.

Mr Abe said Australia had Japan had lifted the relationship with the signing of agreements on economic partnership and defence co-operation.

He said 57 years ago his grandfather visited Australia and signed the agreement of commerce.

'Since then both countries became true friends,' he said.

'I came away with the impression this time that the Australia people are very much convinced that Japan is a true friend.'
