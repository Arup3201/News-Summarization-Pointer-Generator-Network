An 11-year-old girl is tackling the Philadelphia Archdiocese after it banned her from playing on the Catholic Youth Organization football team because of her gender.

Caroline Pla has played football since she was five, but the all-star offensive guard has now been told this will be her last season with the Romans in Bucks County due to an 'all boys' rule.

'I felt that they thought I wasn't good enough,' Caroline, a sixth grader, told Fox 29. 'It was discrimination, it just didn't feel good.'

The CYO explained in a statement that its decision was based on a policy that football is 'a full contact sport designated for boys'. They said the policy is being reviewed to make the rule clearer.

But speaking with ABC 6, Caroline said: 'It's not just a safety issue for girls. It could be a safety issue for anybody. As long as we know how to play 
and play right.'

She added that she was about the same size as her fellow players - 5 feet and 95 pounds in her first season, and 5-foot-3 and 110 pounds this last season.

And many opposing players didn't even know they were playing against a girl due to her skill and how she presented herself on the field, she said.

'I had my hair pulled up,' she told the Philadelphia Inquirer. 'And I kept my helmet on except at halftime and the end of the game. There was never a time when I couldn't handle myself.'

But she added: 'Sometimes, they used 
curse words and made fun of me for being a girl and made fun of my 
teammates for playing with a girl.'

Still, the star player said that she does not want to give up her beloved hobby - or her friends.

'My
 favourite thing was probably all the friends that I made through it and
 they are all like my brothers now and that's the best part,' she said.

'At first, everybody was like "whoa there's a girl," but then they accepted me. If I feel I want to stop, I will just stop, but as of now I want to keep going if I can.'

An online petition against Caroline's treatment, entitled Allow Girls to Play, has now garnered more than 7,000 signatures.

And Caroline's parents, George and Seal Pla, said their daughter also has the support of her teammates, her coach and other young girls who look up to her.

'She really wants the rule changed, not just for herself, but for the girls who have come up to her and said I'm going to play football,' Caroline's mother said.

The Archdiocese said the policy is under review, but Caroline's father George said he does not believe it will change 'an archaic and discriminatory' rule.

'The decision whether or not you put a 
child on a football field or any other field should be up to the parent 
and the coach, and the assessment of the kid's ability should be done 
objectively,' he said.

Her teammate and neighbor Jake Kueny 
said she was a valued member of the team, explaining: 'She is really 
good. She can kick my butt sometimes and I
 can kick her's sometimes.'

Her coach, Jim Reichwein, said she was a skilled player and an inspiration to the team.

'If you can tackle, if you can block, if you can run, it has nothing to do with whether you are a girl, or a boy, or live in a mansion or are homeless or the color of your skin,' he said. 'Football figures it out.'
