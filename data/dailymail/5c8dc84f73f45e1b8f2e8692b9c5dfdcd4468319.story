Capital cities on the east coast of Australia have experienced their coldest winter mornings in years as temperatures plummeted over the weekend.

In Melbourne the mercury dropped to just above 1 degree, the coldest recorded temperature in 16 years.

Though the city itself managed to stay just above zero, some of the outer suburbs were a little chillier, and Richard Carlyon from the Weather Bureau told the ABC the drop in temperatures was due to clear skies and light winds.

Melbourne and Sydney have woken up to their coldest mornings in years after snowfall across the weekend

The coldest suburb in the Melbourne-Geelong area was Avalon at -3C degrees, while further west Ballarat got down to -5C, the lowest temperature since 2002.

In the mountains the cold weather continued, and the mercury at Mount Bulla dropped to 8 degrees, the coldest of any of the ski resorts.

It was also a frosty start in Sydney, which woke up to its coldest morning in four years - with a low of 5.5 degrees.

On Thursday Sydney was at the other end of the scale when it reached 25 degrees, just shy of the record July 24 date, set 14 years ago, when the city was hit with a top of 25.9 degrees.

Despite the plummeting temperatures in some parts of the state, in northern NSW bushfires have destroyed homes and still threaten many more on the far north coast.

Hundreds of firefighters battled blazes through the night and the number of homes lost it yet to be confirmed. The emergency alert for Kremnos in far-north NSW has been downgraded to advice.

More than 90 fires are burning across the state and on Saturday afternoon three people were rescued by air from the out of control blazes.

Elsewhere Australians have experienced a wild weekend of winter chills as a cold-snap brought snowfall and extreme winds to many parts of the country.

Residents living in Sydney's scenic Blue Mountains were treated to a splattering of snowfall on Friday night, as the first pictures of white atop the ranges appeared on Twitter around the Katoomba and Lithgow region.

Further afield it was Bathurst, about three hours from the city, which copped an unexpected overnight overnight drenching of snow as residents braved the plummeting temperatures.

The opening of the heavens ended Sydney's spell of above average temperatures which peaked on Thursday with a top of 25 degrees celcius.

Senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology Peter Zmijewski told the Sydney Morning Herald that snow had been forecast to fall down to 600 metres across the Blue Mountains and Central Tablelands.

'It's cold enough, so it's no surprise to us [that it's snowing],' Mr Zmijewski said.

The state's snow resorts also copped a fresh coating of powder with up to 15cm falling at Thredbo on Friday and 27cm bucketing over Perisher in the past 72 hours, but none in the last 24.

In Victoria, residents of Ballarat froze through a night of below-zero temperatures with the temperature gauge plummeting to -5.

The cold-snap brought snow, blanketing the town with 5cm of icy powder making for some of the heaviest snow fall in Ballarat in recent years.

A Weatherzone spokesperson said the 'super cold temperatures' were produced in the wake of a vigorous cold front which not only swept across Victoria.

Canberrans and South Australians were also met with minor snow falls and weather experts are anticipating more ahead for the weekend.

Weatherzone meteorologist Sam Brown said he had heard reports of snow falling around the Canberra region on Friday although he said any sighting would have been fleeting.

'I've heard reports that there has been snow falling around the Canberra region, but most likely around the elevated areas and higher peaks around Canberra, not the city itself,' he said.

The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast 'a brief snow shower' around the higher peaks of the Adelaide Hills and Flinders Ranges in South Australia. region.

Peaks of up to 600m at Mt Lofty and 700m further north are in line for snow fall.
