German football club MSV Duisburg had to change plans for their warm-weather training camp in Turkey - after finding themselves booked in the same hotel as 400 Russian models.

The third division outfit were forced to alter their winter break at Turkey's Antalya because the resort had doubled booked a beauty contest.

A statement released by Duisburg with a smiley face on their official website said: 'We want to calmly prepare for the spring series. MSV team manager Michael Meier has therefore rescheduled.'

They will now stay at the Royal Holiday Palace instead of the Hotel Royal Wings following the mix-up

The German club changed hotels after finding out and said: 'We want to calmly prepare for the spring series'

They will now stay at the Royal Holiday Palace between January 8 and 16 instead of the Hotel Royal Wings following the mix-up, just down the road from the hundreds of models. 

Should they fancy watching Duisburg in action, though, they will be able to do so when the Zebras take on Belgian outfit Royal White Star Woluwe and German club SG Sonnenhof in friendlies.

The German football season, unlike its English equivalent, goes on a break during winter before returning on January 31.
