More than 8,000 motorists in the UK are driving despite having picked up enough penalty points to be banned from the roads, it emerged today.

Drivers who collect 12 points on their driving licence should face an immediate ban.

But shocking figures obtained from the DVLA show a staggering number have escaped disqualification and are legally driving around despite exceeding the limit.

More than 8,000 motorists in the UK are driving despite having 12 points on their licence, which should lead to an immediate ban

This is because courts can a rule that a motorist who faces losing their licence could face ‘exceptional hardship’ and escape a ban.

Incredibly, one unnamed motorist from Warrington, Cheshire is driving around after racking up a total of 36 points - three times the disqualification figure.

And there are three individuals with 33 points and another driving around with 30.

The eight drivers with more than 30 points on their licences come from Greater London, Colchester, Southend, Romford, Oldham, Huddersfield and Doncaster.

Points can be put on a driver's licence for a variety of motoring offences, from speeding to drink driving and they stay on a driving licence for up to four years.

Bans can last between six months and two years for those who have more than 12 points on their licences and if a driver is banned for more than 56 days they must apply for a new licence before being allowed back on the roads.

There are 33 drivers who have more than double the amount of points required to get disqualified - 19 of these have 24 points.

The DVLA said they have no say in how sentences and bans are imposed on drivers. A spokesman said: ‘The DVLA's role is to record the information provided by the courts.

‘The courts are able to use their discretion to decide whether or not to disqualify a driver. However, the statistics are likely to include cases where drivers have served their period of disqualification and successfully reapplied for their driving licences.’

The Magistrates' Association, which represents magistrates in England and Wales, said about 30,000 drivers a year reach the 12-point mark with nine per cent of these escaping disqualification.

They also said in some instances drivers with a large amount of points may be ‘anomalies’ who have benefited from poor communication between organisations.

A spokesman said: ‘The Association has previously written to the Transport Minister about communications failures between HMCTS, DVLA and some fixed penalty offices which resulted in inaccurate driver records and the possibility that courts did not have full details of a driver's history in front of them.

‘There's a problem that the DVLA have no way of recording exception hardship on their computer system we're hoping that they will change this when they revamp their computer system.’

Peter Rodger, chief examiner and head of driving standards from the Institute of Advanced Motorists said drivers who are close to 12 points need to improve their driving.

He said: ‘It's difficult to turn around and say there's a direct danger caused by it but on the other hand it is also the case that if everyone thinks this is what happens then the respect for the rules of the road and for obeying the law on the road will be removed.

‘If you're in the position where you've got points on your licence and the next set of points are going to take you into the realms where you would expect a ban then you need to sort your driving out, you shouldn't be behaving like that.

‘There isn't a good reason for people to be behaving like that.’

In total the figures revealed there are 8,099 drivers with 12 more or penalty points on their driving licences.

CR00 - Croydon - 6,855

SL06 - Slough - 5,884

LE02 - Leicester - 5,874

NG05 - Nottingham - 5,204

ML06 - Motherwell - 5,114

LE03 - Leicester - 4,989

BN03 - Brighton - 4,773

BN02 - Brighton - 4,711

WA05 - Warrington - 4,559

CF14 - Cardiff - 4,499

This is a slight decline from 2011 when there were 10,000 drivers who could have been banned but were not.

However the Institute of Advanced Motorists said it has become easier for motorists to keep their licences when they have 12 points.

Mr Rodger added: ‘It does appear that that has become more flexible than it used to be. The grounds on which people are allowed to retain their licence do appear to have been relaxed.

‘I don't think there's been a sudden relaxation but it's one of those things that has gradually happened over time.’

There are more than 3.3 million road users in the UK who have penalty points on their driving licences.

Figures from the DVLA show more than 2.5 million have picked up in excess of three points.

Motorists in Croydon are the worst behaving, with 6,855 drivers living in the CR00 postcode having penalty points and one motorist racking up 24 points.

Following Croydon are small areas of Slough, Leicester, Nottingham and Motherwell, who all have more than 5,000 drivers with points on their licences.

Rodger said the total number of drivers with points on their licence ‘indicates how endemic our misbehaviour has been.’
