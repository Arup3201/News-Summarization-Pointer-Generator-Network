Australian airline passengers will be affected by tightened airport anti-terror checks on electronic gadgets, the government has confirmed.

Tests on mobile phones, laptops and tablets that had been limited to passengers flying from the UK to the US will now be massively expanded to cover destinations around the world.

Although the extra measures will not be in place at Australian airports, passengers travelling through affected terminals will have their devices tested, creating possible delays.

A dramatic escalation of airport anti-terror checks on electronic gadgets was announced by ministers

The new measures are understood to affect hundreds more flights to and from the Middle East and volatile parts of Africa and Asia, including popular summer holiday destinations such as Egypt.

Qantas code-shares with Dubai-based Emirates, meaning flights from Australia could be affected.

'The extra measures have been implemented due to concerns around a heightened terrorist threat to aviation for direct flights to the US and UK and mean that travellers departing these locations on US and UK-bound flights may experience additional security screening either at the main security checkpoint or at their boarding gate,' a spokesman for Federal Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said.

'These measures may apply to passengers departing and transiting through affected airports, including Australian carriers – Qantas and Virgin Australia and their code-share airlines. 

'At this stage, the Australian Government is not requiring additional security measures for any international inbound or outbound flights to Australia and the National Public Terrorism Alert Level remains unchanged at MEDIUM.'

Under the measures, travellers will have to prove their electronic devices – some with a notoriously short battery life – are working normally, following fears that terrorists could pack the battery compartments with explosives.

The development, which comes at the start of the European summer holiday season, is based on US intelligence amid fears of an attack by Islamist extremists.

Security officials are concerned that a booby-trapped electronic device could be smuggled onto a plane and used as a bomb by Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or the Islamist Nusra Front, Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria.

In 2009, Yemen-linked explosives expert Ibrahim al-Asiri was behind a similar plot and built an ‘underwear bomb’, used in a failed attempt to bring down a plane from Amsterdam bound for Detroit.

Tests on mobile phones, laptops and tablets will now be expanded to cover destinations around the world

Passengers were first warned last week
 of extra checks on phones, and on Monday British Airways said it would 
ban travellers from boarding US-bound flights if their electronic 
devices were not charged.

It
 performed a partial U-turn yesterday, announcing that anyone whose 
devices had a flat battery could still fly – but they would have to 
leave their gadgets behind, and pay for them to be sent to their home 
address.

Official advice to 
travellers from the UK's Department for Transport had previously been limited
 to those ‘flying to the USA’.

It now affects those ‘flying to and from 
the UK’, and states: ‘Make sure your electronic devices are charged 
before you travel. If your device doesn’t switch on, you won’t be 
allowed to bring it on to the aircraft.’

Gadgets packed in checked luggage will
 continue to be scanned as normal. Passengers whose devices are deemed 
to be suspicious could be prevented from leaving them in the hold – and 
could be barred from getting on flights altogether.

UK Transport
 Secretary Patrick McLoughlin  said yesterday that ‘passengers may 
notice additional security measures on some routes both to and from the 
UK’.

A DfT spokesman added:
 ‘In line with the US advice, passengers on some routes into and out of 
the UK may now also be required to show that electronic devices in their
 hand luggage are powered up or face not being allowed to bring the 
device onto the aircraft.’

Mr
 McLoughlin told the House of Commons that the new advice ‘is in line 
with that issued by the US, and we have updated our official advice to 
passengers accordingly’.

Checks will affect hundreds more flights to and from the Middle East and volatile parts of Africa and Asia

His
 written statement continued: ‘For obvious reasons we will not be 
commenting in detail on the measures or the routes affected.

'We will 
work with the aviation industry to minimise disruption as far as 
possible.’

Mr McLoughlin stressed there was no change to the terror 
threat level, which remains at ‘substantial’, but warned: ‘We face a 
constantly evolving threat from terrorism and must respond accordingly.’

The escalation in security
 checks came hours after British Airways ditched its own ‘no charge, no 
fly’ rule, announcing that passengers whose devices had a flat battery 
could still board planes – but without their gadgets.

The airline will 
now see checks extended far beyond the 35 daily flights from the UK to 
the US which were first affected.

A
 BA spokesman said: ‘We would advise that all customers flying on routes
 into and out of the UK, as well on flights from the UK to US cities, 
ensure that their electronic devices are powered up, as there may be 
extra searches and checks before boarding.

'Our flights continue to 
operate as normal.’

They 
added: ‘Safety and security is our top priority at all times and we 
continue to work closely with airports and governments around the 
world.’

BA also announced 
measures – similar to those of rivals Virgin Atlantic – to allow 
customers to have their devices returned at a later date.

As in Virgin’s case, the cost of a courier will be covered by the passenger.

BA said it was ‘liaising with UK airports with a view to  finding a workable solution’.
