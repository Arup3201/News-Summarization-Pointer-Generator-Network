Shoppers are in revolt at Swedish clothing giant H&M's decision to ban people from entering the store with their shopping trolleys.

Customers have vented their outrage on the brand's global Facebook page after being refused entry to H&M's new store in Indooroopilly, in Brisbane's western suburbs, with their trolleys.

The store opened in the local shopping centre on March 5. 

Customers have taken H&M's global Facebook page in anger after being refused entry to H&M's new store in Indooroopilly, in Brisbane's western suburbs, with their trolleys

One woman said it was 'rude' she was not allowed to bring her trolley in but others with prams were welcomed.

'When I questioned why, the guy told me someone could get hurt by the trolley, because it made out of steel,' she wrote.

'When I pointed out that prams are also made of metal and are just as bulky as a trolley and someone could also get hurt by them.

'He just replied it the company policy for both our stores. 

'Do you also stop people in wheelchairs entering your store cause they are made of steel? Shame Shame on your Stores [sic].'

One woman said it was rude for shoppers who had trolleys to be turned away while those with prams were allowed

A man said he had a similar experience saying he took his business elsewhere because of the snub

A representative of H&M replied to her Facebook message and apologised for the 'negative experience', but echoed the response the woman got in the store.

'Currently our policy does indeed restrict trolleys within the store, however we are always looking to improve our experience for customers and are currently reviewing this,' the representative said.

They added: 'Please email us at info.au@hm.com if you would like to discuss this matter further.'

Dissatisfied with the response, the woman said she would not be shopping with the retailer again.

'I will never again try and enter your store,' she wrote.

'I think your store needs too show some respect to the consumer.'

While another woman said she 'won't bother returning again' because she was refused entry for having a trolley

A H&M spokeswoman said a higher incidence of accidents happened when trolleys were inside the store 

A spokeswoman for the retailer told Daily Mail Australia they had experienced a higher incidence of trolley-related injuries when they were allowed in store. 

'However we do appreciate the feedback we have received from our customers so we are continuing to evaluate this policy,' she said.

The spokeswoman further clarified: 'This policy is in no way related to our customers with prams or in wheelchairs who are of course welcome in all of our stores.'

But there were others who expressed displeasure about H&M's no trolley policy.

One man said he had planned to spend $500 in the store until he was told he could not enter.

'I had my special needs 4 year old in the trolley to keep her contained... the trolley was to have room for the big purchase i was going to make. all that money went elsewhere [sic],' he said.

While another woman also felt compelled to share her experience online and said she would not attempt to shop at H&M again.

'I was so excited to check out your Indooroopilly store today but was refused entry because I had my 2 children in a trolley. I won't bother returning again,' she said.
