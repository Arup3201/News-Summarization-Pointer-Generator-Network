Paul Pogba has posted a photo of himself signing his new contract with Serie A giants Juventus.

The 21-year-old, whose previous deal was due to expire in 2016, recently put pen to paper on a deal that will keep him at the Italian club until June 2019.

The former Manchester United midfielder had been the subject of considerable interest from around Europe, leading the Turin club to treble his wages to around £70,000 per week.

Juve had been keen to tie the 21-year-old central midfielder down as he has become the target of several top European clubs. 

'We have just signed Paul Pogba's renewal until 2019,' Juve club administrator Giuseppe Marotta said during a shareholders meeting in Turin on Friday.

Pogba, who was named the young player of the tournament at the World Cup in Brazil in the summer, moved to Turin two years ago on a free transfer from Manchester United.

He has formed a solid partnership with Italian veteran Andrea Pirlo, which has contributed to Juve's back-to-back Serie A titles.

Marotta announced earlier his month that Juve had turned down several lucrative offers for Pogba in the summer.
