Gangsters who plotted to murder Justin Bieber and castrate him with a pair of garden shears were offered a bounty of $2,500 for each of the teen heart-throb's testicles, it has been claimed.

Jailed Dana Martin, who has a tattoo of the star on his leg, is accused of offering the reward after recruiting two men to kidnap the singer along with his body guard and two other victims.

According to police Martin hatched the grisly plot because he felt Bieber had snubbed his efforts to contact him.

Target: Two men who planned to kill and castrate Justin Bieber after 
his November 28 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York (pictured) were offered $2,500 for each of the singer's testicles it has been claimed

Plot: Dana Martin (left) is said to be obsessed with the pop singer, and has a tattoo of Bieber on his leg; he recruited Mark Staake (right) to carry out the plot

He allegedly ordered his accomplices to first 
strangle the victims with a paisley tie as it was his 'calling card' 
which he had used in previous attacks.

Martin met Mark Staake, a fellow 
inmate at Las Cruces state prison in New Mexico years ago. While there, 
Staake agreed to enlist his own nephew in order to carry out the 
murderous plot. 

Tooled up: One of the gang was picked up in possession of pair of garden shears he allegedly planned to use to carry out the castration

Staake and Ruane were alledly poised 
to strike while the Canadian singer was in New York for a performance at
Madison Square Garden on November 28. But for unknown reasons, Martin told 
jail wardens about the plot and Staake, 41, was arrested in Vermont on 
an unrelated outstanding warrant while driving with 23-year-old Ruane.

Ruane was released but was later recorded discussing plans with Martin on the phone.

According to court documents obtained by the Sun Newspaper, when Mr
Martin asked what Staake had bought to castrate the victims, Ruane said
he had bought a pair of hand-held hedge clippers.

When Ruane was arrested in New York on
November 20 police discovered a brand new pair of Fiskars Durasharp 
pruning shears in his car.

A police document sates: 'In response 
to Mr Staake’s reluctance to follow through with the castrations, Mr 
Ruane stated he was going to do it and get ‘five large for each one I 
get’. Mr Martin confirmed that Mr Ruane was going to get $2,500 per 
testicle.'

Mastermind: Dana Martin was arrested for raping and killing a 15-year-old girl in 2000 (seen here), but since spending time behind bars, his newest teenage target appears to be the Canadian singer

Criminal relatives: Mark Staake (left) met Martin in prison and agreed to take on the assassination plot with the help of his nephew Tanner Ruane (right)

Martin is currently serving two life sentences for raping and killing a 15-year-old girl in 2000.

In an affidavit enclosed with Tanner 
Ruane's warrant Martin explained that had plotted the attack because he 
was upset that Bieber had snubbed his attempts to make contact.

According to the arrest warrant Martin
had asked Ruane if they had bags to put the testicles in and had 
suggested hiding them in the engine compartment of the car to avoid 
detection should they get pulled over by police.

The court papers state: 'When asked to
explain why Victim 3 (Bieber) was to be killed, Mr Martin stated that 
Victim 3 has a measure of fame and that he had become infatuated with 
Victim 3.

Turning against them: Martin was the one who reported the plot to police, even though he planned the whole operation, including the instruction to use paisley ties (right) since those were his 'calling card'

'Mr Martin stated he had attempted to solicit correspondence on numerous occasions and that Victim 3 never returned in kind.

'This perceived slight made Mr Martin 
upset and, coupled with Mr Martin’s perception of being a ‘nobody’ in 
prison, led him to begin plotting the kidnap and murder.'

As Martin is already serving life 
sentences it is not known if he will face further charges. But a New 
York State Police spokesman said he may be responsible for other 
kidnaps and murders across America.

A spokesman for Bieber, 18, who has sold more than 15million albums since bursting on the scene in 2009, said every precaution was taken to protect the star and his fans.
