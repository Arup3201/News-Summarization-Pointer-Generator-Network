Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has criticised the sacking of Tim Sherwood and claimed the high turnover of managers will affect the quality of the Premier League.

Tottenham boss Sherwood became the second Premier League manager to lose his job this week, following West Brom's decision to part company with Pepe Mel on Monday.

Wenger is the longest-serving manager in the Premier League and has outlasted 10 permanent Spurs bosses since his appointment in 1996.

Secure: Wenger is the longest-serving manager in the Premier League, having been at Arsenal since 1996

During
 his six months in charge at White Hart Lane, Sherwood pleaded to be 
given the time to develop Tottenham into a side capable of challenging 
Arsenal for a place in the top four but was dismissed after delivering a
 sixth-placed finish.

Rather
 than bask in the failure of another Spurs manager, Wenger instead 
chose to highlight the high turnover of managers and warned Arsenal's 
north London rivals that they are stifling their own progress by 
changing manager so often.

He
 said: 'Tottenham manager or any other manager, it's always sad when 
someone loses their job. The worrying thing is the rotation of managers 
is very good and that is not good.

'I believe technical stability is important for the quality of the game.'

Clapping him off: Sherwood wanted the chance to develop Spurs but instead was sacked after six monthsÂ 

Wenger also revealed that nothing had changed regarding the future of Bacary Sagna, but believes the player is focused enough to play for Arsenal in the FA Cup final against Hull on Saturday.

Sagna's contract expires at the end of the season and he has been linked with Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea all linked but Wenger has not given up hope of convincing the France international to remain at the club.

He said: 'I have told you many times. The ball is in his court.'

Asked if he had any doubts about selecting him against Hull at Wembley, Wenger added: 'None at all. I don't doubt his integrity or commitment.'

In doubt: Bacary Sagna has been linked with a move to Man City, Liverpool and Chelsea
