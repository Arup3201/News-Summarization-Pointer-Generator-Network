Questionable parenting: Heather McAuliffe, 39, of Florida, emailed her son's teacher that she had given the boy 5mg of her ADHD drug and asked for updates on his behavior

A Florida mother has been arrested on suspicion of child abuse after police say she had slipped her 6-year-old son Adderall to see if it alters his behavior.

Heather McAuliffe, 39, of Boca Raton, was taken into custody Thursday and released from Palm County Jail later that day after posting a $3,000 bond.

According to investigators, McAuliffe emailed her son's first-grade teacher about her Adderall experiment and asked her for updates on any changes in his conduct.

‘I tried something today… I gave (son’s name) 5 MG of my Adderall just to see if there is a noticeable difference,' she wrote in the message cited by Sun-Sentinel. ‘ He does not know because i crushed it up in his yogurt.’

Adderall is a prescription drug used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

McAuliffe concluded her message by asking the teacher to email her if she notices 'any changes' in the 6-year-old's behavior in class.  

On Thursday, police went to McAuliffe’s home in the 22000 block of Palms Way West to question her about the email.

The 39-year-old mother allegedly confessed to giving her son Adderall, saying she did it to help him.

Stimulant: Adderall is a prescription drug used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder containing amphetamine and dextroamphetamine

Arrest: When officers came to McAuliffe's home on Palms Way West, she admitted to giving her son Adderall

The medicine, which is a central nervous system stimulant combining amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, comes with a long list of side effects and may cause slow growth in children.

Under Florida state law, teachers are required to report any instance of possible child abuse.
