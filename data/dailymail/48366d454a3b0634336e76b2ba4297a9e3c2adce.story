You might be only a pretty face, but it seems that’s all you need to get on in today’s world of work.

A study has found beautiful people do better in their careers – even after their youthful good looks have begun to fade.

At each career stage studied, pretty people held more prestigious jobs than plain Janes. 

Destined for success? Sociologists found that beauty played a role in what job a person got and how successful they were, even when taking into account IQ, level of education and parents' education

The researchers said attractive sorts may gravitate to good jobs because they are more confident.

Alternatively, the plain may be penalised by employers.

The
 British and Italian team used decades of data on more than 8,000 men 
and women who left school in Wisconsin in the US in 1957.

This
 included information about employment at various points in life, school
 photos that were used to rate their looks and information about their 
education and their parents’ social class. 

Those
 rated the most attractive on leaving school tended to have better jobs 
and more prestigious careers, even when close to retirement.

The finding held even when other factors, such as intelligence and education, were taken into account.

Researcher
 Gundi Knies, of Essex University’s Institute for Social and Economic 
Research, said good looking people may benefit from a ‘beauty premium’.

She
 added: ‘We found facial attractiveness is important in determining 
people’s occupational prestige at the beginning of the career as it is 
in the middle or at the end.’

The study tracked the career outcomes of more than 8,000 people and found the best looking were more successful throughout their whole lives

'Or, in other words, the so called beauty premium is stable throughout people's employment history and pretty people are doing better even as they age.'

Writing
 in Research in Social Stratification and Mobility, Dr Knies said 
employers may be drawn towards attractive staff. It is also possible the
 good looking have the confidence to aim higher.

Previous studies have shown that attractive people are usually hired sooner, get promotions more quickly and earn up to four per cent more than their colleagues who are less aesthetically pleasing.

The latest findings, published in Research in Stratification and Mobility, offer a fresh perspective to the study of social inequalities and could improve understanding of whether looks affect employment.

Together with colleagues from the University of Milan Biococca, Dr Knies relied on data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, which graduates from the local university in 1957.

A panel of experts assessed their high school yearbook photos and awarded each a beauty score and then tracked their careers by analysing their employment history.

Those with the highest beauty scores were found to have the better jobs and more prestigious careers over those with lower scores, despite other differences in socioeconomic background, parent education and even their own IQs.

'Our facial features are largely genetically determined and the research raises a number of questions regarding the processes that underlie the reproduction of social inequalities, said Dr Knie.

'For example, do beautiful men and women have higher occupational prestige because employers discriminate against plain people?

'Or is it that beautiful men and women choose more prestigious occupations, for example, because they enjoy a higher self esteem and are more self confident.'
