It's that time of year when it's easy to accept the endless stream of food on offer without giving your waistline a second thought.

From politely accepting a few mince pies, to treating yourself to an extra glass of mulled wine, it's not hard to see how the calories add up.

So to avoid months of additional work in the gym in 2015, nutritionists advise being conscious of eating habits over Christmas.

Tim Hart, head nutritionist at Reebok Sports Club in Canary Wharf, London, told MailOnline: 'Many of us treat Christmas as a "write off" and go well and truly over the average daily calorie intake, snacking on endless Christmas nibbles.

'But this can lead to months of extra work trying to shed the pounds.' 

Here, Mr Hart reveals the time and exercise it would take to burn off popular Christmas meals and snacks...

Tim Hart, head nutritionist at Reebok Sports Club in Canary Wharf, London, has calculated how much time it would take to burn off some popular Christmas foods, and recommended which exercises will do this most efficiently

ONE MINCE PIE

Calories per serving: 289

Time taken to burn those calories: 30-45 minutes

Recommended exercises: 5k run in under 35 minutes, jogging for 45 minutes.

Best alternative: 6 squares of dark chocolate has half the calories. If you must have a mince pie, at least avoid the added cream!  

Mr Hart suggests swapping Christmas pudding, which is 300 - 400 calories a serving, for a lower calorie dessert: jelly embedded with fruit

SINGLE SERVING OF CHRISTMAS PUDDING  

Calories per serving: 300-400

Time taken to burn those calories: 45-90 minute

Recommended exercises: Fast swimming 45 minutes, A 60 min indoor spin class, 60 minute jog without rest and at moderate pace, 90 minute cross trainer session

Best alternative:  One of the lowest calorie deserts worth serving is jelly embedded with fruit. Not a traditional dish but easy to get away with serving at buffets and Xmas parties!

TURKEY DINNER

Calories per serving: 1,450

Time taken to burn those calories: 2-5 hours

Recommended exercises:  A half marathon in 2 ½ hours. 3 football matches, Jogging 3 miles at a moderate pace, every day, for a week

There are a whopping 1,450 calories in a Turkey dinner, which would take up to five hours to burn off

Best alternative: Avoiding Christmas dinner is almost impossible! Just try and avoid calorific foods such as roast potatoes, bacon wrapped sausages and bread sauce, and replace with alternatives such as boiled potatoes, turkey meat and gravy made from granules. 

ADVENT CALENDAR

Calories per serving: 528

Time taken to burn those calories: 1-2 hours

Recommended exercises: A 60 minute circuit class or cross training class completed at high intensity throughout. 

Best alternative:  Try a small helping of plain popcorn per day. Or replace with chocolate raisin. If serious get an advent candle instead!

GLASS OF MULLED WINE 

Calories per serving:  106

Time taken to burn those calories: Just over 20 minutes

Recommended exercises:  20 minutes of interval exercise or ice skating for an hour

Best alternative: Mulled wine has great benefits it has lots of antioxidants, stick to 1 0r 2 as it still contains sugar 

YULE LOG SERVING 

Calories per serving: 160

Time taken to burn those calories: Just over 45 minutes

Recommended exercises: A high intensity circuit, a dance class for an hour or a 50/50 workout – half cardio half weights

Best alternative:  If buying try and an buy an healthier option or stick to one slice only. 

To burn off the 160 calories in a Yule log serving, take a high intensity circuits class, or an hour long dance class, Mr Hart advises
