A mother has revealed her humiliation after she was told to cover up while breastfeeding her baby on a Delta Airlines flight.

Casey Yu was traveling from Atlanta to Tallahassee on Flight 2655 this weekend after attending a family funeral in Connecticut.

She said that after a long day of traveling, she settled into her seat to feed her hungry and sleepy son. The mother said she unlatched her bra strap and fed her son with minimum exposure to other passengers.

Casey Yu, pictured with her one-year-old son Will, has demanded an apology from Delta Airlines after two members of cabin crew told her to cover up while breastfeeding on a flight this weekend

She was quickly approached by a female flight attendant who gave Ms Yu a blanket to cover herself and her one-year-old son Will.

Ms Yu told WTXL: 'I asked what it was for because I didn’t 
ask for a blanket and she said it was ''for you to cover up while you’re 
nursing.'' I said I don’t need that, thank you. She said ''well, we’re 
getting complaints about this.'''

The mother, who has two other children, said this is the first time she has ever been reprimanded for breastfeeding.

A second flight attendant, who Ms Yu described as 'really aggressive' then ordered her to cover up. She responded that it was within her rights to breastfeed her baby.

The mother also added that it was late at night and no one was sitting next to her, so she was unsure who allegedly complained.

The mother-of-three posted an account of her ordeal on Twitter after being ordered not to breastfeed on a flight by Delta flight attendants

Ms Yu vented her anger at the situation on social media where she was met with resounding support.

She tweeted: 'Hey @Delta @DeltaNewsroom @DeltaAssist on flight 2655 to TLH and 2 flight attendants told me to cover up while nursing my baby. NOT. OK.'

She later posted: 'My baby and I decide when to nurse. MY BODY, not yours.'

When the flight landed, Ms Yu asked to see a supervisor. The Captain joined the discussion and apologized, Ms Yu said.

She said that the flight attendant then changed her story and denied saying there had been a complaint.

Ms Yu tweeted: 'I have never been so disrespected before in my life. Male FA said I was showing people (WHO??) my entire front side. #feedwill'

Dozens of people offered their support to Ms Yu. ‏@maryblau responded: '@caseyyu I'm incensed on your behalf. That's absurd. Terrible.'

@cataltmaier wrote: '@caseyyu Oh my God. How did you not slap him?! And even if you were (though I know you weren’t), IT’S YOUR RIGHT TO BREASTFEED!'

In a statement to MailOnline today, Delta said: 'We have spoken with our crew members and have reached out to the passenger to express our apology and provide a ticket refund.'

The company's website states: 'Delta fully supports a woman’s right to breast-feed on board Delta and Delta Connection aircraft and in Delta facilities.'
