Kevin Lee, who helps to manage the office of Labour MP Andy Burnham (pictured), is paid through a private company - an arrangement used to avoid tax 

Labour is under fire for employing a senior adviser on an ‘off payroll’ arrangement which is often used to avoid tax.

Kevin Lee, who manages the office of shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, is not on a typical staff contract but is paid through his own private company.

These sorts of deals have been criticised by Labour, because they allow both the employee and the employer to get out of paying National Insurance contributions.

If Mr Lee - who worked at HM Revenue and Customs in the 1990s – was paying himself out of company dividends, he could also avoid income tax and just pay Corporation Tax at a lower rate.

These arrangements are legal but Margaret Hodge, a Labour grandee and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, has lambasted the widespread use of them at the BBC and in Whitehall.

She said two years ago: ‘If you work in the public service, its beholden on you to lead by example. Hardworking families up and down the country are paying lots of money in tax and its wrong that individuals working in the public service whose money comes from the tax those families pay aren’t paying their due share.

‘I do think that it’s an issue which somehow people got away with in better times, but now in the austerity era its obviously hugely important that every penny due is collected.’

A Labour party spokesman said they ‘do not comment on staffing matters’. Mr Lee, through the party, denied the pay arrangement for the last two years was for financial gain.

One other – unidentified - political adviser, to a different MP, is understood to have similar arrangements. Both Mr Lee and the other adviser and are being moved onto staff contracts this year.

Mr Lee, 50, is a former Labour party staffer who ran Mr Burnham’s failed leadership bid, and loaned money to it, in 2010.

He was hired to head Mr Burnham’s office in October 2011, for two-and-a-half days a week, paid for by the Labour party.

The arrangement is legal but has previously been lambasted by Margaret Hodge, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee and Labour grandee

The rest of the week he worked for Hazel Blears MP, and was paid for that by Ipsa which regulates MP’s expenses.

Party sources said his off-payroll status dates back to when he worked for both MPs, and it is an anomaly which was not rectified when he went full-time with Mr Burnham in summer 2012.

When he was appointed, Mr Lee’s job with Andy Burnham was attacked as a ‘huge conflict of interest’ because his PR firm – Lee Communications and Public Affairs – had several NHS trusts as clients.

His LinkedIn page boasts of his ‘political acumen, excellent public affairs knowledge, and significant experience and understanding of stakeholder engagement with politicians.’

A Tory source said: ‘Labour want to put up National Insurance and hit families and businesses across the country – so it’s pretty galling that they don’t want to pay it for their own employees.

‘This is yet another classic case of Labour saying one thing and doing another. Burnham should apologise.’

Danny Cox head of financial planning at Hargreaves Lansdown explained: ‘Charging fees through a service company is far more tax efficient than being self-employed.

‘This is primarily because the employee pays some or all of their own salary in dividends – which are subject to a lower rate of income tax and no employee or employer national insurance.’
