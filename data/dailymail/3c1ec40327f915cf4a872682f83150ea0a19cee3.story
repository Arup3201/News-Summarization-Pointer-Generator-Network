They arrived in their thousands, leaving their husbands and children at home and ready to relive their teenage past.

But the excitement of seeing their idols in concert proved too much for hordes of Take That fans of a certain age.

More than 100 women were admitted to hospital after marathon drinking sessions and alcohol-fuelled brawls before the one-time boy band took to the stage.

Take That and party: Two fans frolic in the streets after the band's Cardiff concert

Over-excited: The pop fans were already having a very good time before it even started to get dark

The fans' antics led to them being branded worse than drunken football hooligans.

But they did win praise from Take That singer Robbie Williams, who is now teetotal following a long battle with drink and drugs.

'We used to have the record for the number of girls fainting,' the 37-year-old told the crowd at their concert in Cardiff on Wednesday night.

'Now we have the record for the most middle-aged boozed-up women. I, Robbie Williams, am proud of you.'

What a spectacle: Take That fans were rewarded with an awesome Alice In Wonderland-themed show

Exposed: So much for modest behaviour - many women looked a little worse for wear after the gig

Shoes off, masks on: Lots of girls had taken off their uncomfortable high heels, and a pair of fans hid behind masks of their idols

Earlier, hospital staff in Manchester had said they had been inundated with drunken women from the Take That concerts at the City of Manchester stadium, which ended on Sunday.

And the middle-aged women carried on with their binge at the group's latest show in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium.

Fans sprawled out in the streets 
after all-day drinking sessions before the sell-out 64,000 capacity 
show. Some had to be carried home by patient partners, while others were
so drunk they could not even walk home.

One steward said: 'This lot are worse than the rugby fans we get here. They've been boozing for ages and are hammered.'

Young... at heart: Other fans channeled their latent raver as they danced through the streets in pink wigs

Could it be magic? Lots of women opted for fluffy headwear

A
spokesman for the Millennium Stadium said a handful of fans were 
ejected for 'misbehaviour' but that the majority were well-behaved.

Singer Gary Barlow, 40, also joined in the jokes, making reference to the fact that both Williams and bandmate Mark Owen have fought alcohol addiction.

He handed out glasses of red wine on stage for himself, Howard Donald and Jason Orange – but laughed as he said: 'It's milk for Robbie and Mark.'

In Manchester, the level of drinking led to a spike in numbers attending the A&E department at Manchester Royal Infirmary.

Souvenirs: Some fans had stocked up on merchandising including T-shirts with the same dasign as the cover of Take That's latest album

Dressed for the occasion: Some women looked the part - without getting dangerously drunk

Casualty number one: All the excitement and revelry has left this woman shattered

Casualty number two: It's all too much for this fan

At least 65 women, most in their 
thirties and forties, were thrown out of the band's eight Manchester 
gigs, which were attended by almost half a million fans over the run.

Some were treated for alcohol poisoning while others broke their wrists or sprained their ankles in drunken falls.

Police
had 22 reports of crime in or near the venue, including five public 
order offences, three assaults, several thefts and one sexual assault.

Inspector Mike Coombes said: 'A small minority were able to drink to excess to the extent they spoiled the evening for others.'

Stewards said many female fans in the standing areas arrived hours early to get a position near the stage.

They added that by the time fans had waited for Take That to begin their gig many had had too much to drink.

Pubs around the ground complied with a police request not to sell alcohol to concert-goers.

But alcohol, including £18 full-size plastic bottles of wine, were on sale inside the ground during the concerts.

Take That are still to visit Glasgow before they perform at Wembley Stadium next month.

Cowgirls: Many had made T-shirts or accessories especially for the concert including coordinated whistles and hats

Helping hand: Some women were helped home after the gig

Calm and collected: Some fans watched fellow Take That lovers getting drunk while tucking into a MacDonalds

I'm proud of you: Robbie Williams on stage with Take That at Cardiff Millennium Stadium congratulated his fans for being boozed up

Creating problems: More than 100 women were admitted to hospital after marathon drinking sessions and alcohol-fuelled brawls before the one-time boy band took to the stage
