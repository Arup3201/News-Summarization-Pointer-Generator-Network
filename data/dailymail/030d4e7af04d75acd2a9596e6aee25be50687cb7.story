Despite being the mastermind of a $20 billion investment fraud, Bernard Madoff was no good at maths, according to a former employee.

David Kugel, a former supervisory trader for Madoff, told the jury in the Manhattan federal court that the fraudster ‘had trouble with long division’.

Madoff, 75, is serving a 150-year prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2009 to defrauding investors in his investment firm, considered to be one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in US history.

No good at maths: Bernard Madoff, the mastermind of a $20 billion investment fraud, 'had trouble with long division' a former employee told the court

Kugel, 68, told the court that soon after he was employed to trade convertible bonds by the firm in the 1970s, Madoff got him to figure out rates of return for similar deals he was brokering with private clients.

According to The New York Post, when asked by assistant US attorney Matthew Schwartz’s whether Madoff was ‘good in math’, Kugel said: ‘In some aspects, yes, in some aspects, no.

‘He had trouble with long division.’

Kugel was in court as the first of five government witnesses, all former Madoff employees, to provide evidence on how defendants Annette Bongiorno and Joann Crupi used falsified information on customer accounts.

Under suspicion: Kugel said he was asked to provide outdated trades for defendant Joann Crupi

A lawsuit filed by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission has said that from 2004 through 2008 Crupi 
accumulated $270,000 in expenses on the firm's credit card for which she
never reimbursed the company.

Kugel said Madoff’s secretary 
Bongiorno asked him for out-of-date pricing data in the early 1970s. He 
also laid out this information for Crupi in the late 1980s early 1990s.

He told the court that Bongiorno kept 
back issues of The Wall Street Journal to reference historical prices in
order to ‘fabricate’ trades.

Kugel said his suspicions were 
realised when he opened a personal investment account with the Madoff 
firm to invest $25,000 after the sale of his father-in-law’s house, and 
found his out-of-date trades on his personal statement.

The witness claimed never to have 
suspected a Ponzi scheme and when he questioned Madoff about where the 
money was going, Madoff told him it was invested in foreign currency, 
shopping centres and other such investments.

Kugel said: ‘He was my boss and he asked me to do something. I knew it was wrong, but I just didn’t question him.’

In 2011, Kugel pleaded guilty to 
creating the outdated trades which boosted the fraud after his personal 
account grew to $10 million at one stage.

Other employees: Daniel Bonventre (left) , the director of operations for the firm, and portfolio manager Annette Bongiorno (right) are also listed as defendants in this case

The man’s son, Craig Kugel, also pleaded guilty to being involved in the scheme while working in Madoff’s human resources.

Earlier in the trial, Assistant U.S. 
Attorney John Zach showed jurors Crupi's corporate credit card 
statements for 2004, 2005 and 2006, noting that she took cruises and 
trips to Las Vegas with family members.

Another lavish expense included her 
trips to a liquor store called the Wine Library in Springfield, New 
Jersey, where she spent almost $2,000 on one occasion.

Zach asked a witness from the firm 
whether she observed any behaviour by Crupi that would have explained 
the expenditures as legitimate business expenses, to which they 
responded no.

The government said she also wired 
$2.25 million from the firm's main account to an outside account in late
2008 so she could purchase a beach house in New Jersey.

In addition to Crupi, the defendants 
include Daniel Bonventre, the director of operations for the firm; 
Annette Bongiorno, another portfolio manager; and Jerome O'Hara and 
George Perez, both computer programmers.

All five pleaded not guilty and their 
lawyers have said they did not know about Madoff's scheme or were merely
puppets under Madoff's spell.

Kugel will take the stand again on Monday as the case continues.
