A house painter denies ambushing a San Diego sports anchor who was riddled with bullets outside his home in Scripps Ranch last week.

Mike Montana, 54, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a charge of attempted murder on KFMB-TV's Kyle Kraska, whose home Montana had been hired to paint months earlier. 

Prosecutor Rebecca Zipp said that Montana 'ambushed' Kraska, hitting him six times as he shot up the sportscaster's silver Mercedes.

Montana also was charged with making a threat against another individual, but prosecutors did not go into details about that case.

Police say Montana was in a dispute with Kraska over work done on the reporter's home. Montana surrendered to authorities the same day after a SWAT standoff at his home in El Cajon, a city east of San Diego.

Zipp said the attack on Kraska was 'willful, deliberate and premeditated.' The judge set bail at $750,000.

According to the CBS affiliate, Kraska is making good progress in his recovery at a local hospital.

Todd Villalobos, a KFMB sports producer and friend of Kraska, told the station that the anchor hired Montana to paint the exterior of his house after seeing him work in the neighborhood.

Villalobos said Kraska was dissatisfied with the painter's work. But Kraska he paid the painter, and the two agreed to part ways.

Months later, Montana began leaving notes on Kraska's door, Villalobos said, according to KFMB.

Kraska is the sports director at KFMB, where he has worked since 1999. He has been  the station's evening sports anchor since 2003 and hosts the San Diego Chargers postgame show.

The Boston native began his career as weekend sports anchor in Watertown, New York, during his senior year at Syracuse University before working at stations in California, Florida and Texas.

In a January 2014 filing for personal bankruptcy protection, Montana identified himself as self-employed and the sole owner of Superior Painting Corp.
