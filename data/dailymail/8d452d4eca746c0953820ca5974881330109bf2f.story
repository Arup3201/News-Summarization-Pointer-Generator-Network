Hundreds of balloons and discarded metal canisters found during the V Festival clear-up have revealed the widespread abuse of 'laughing gas' by teenage music fans.

Increasing numbers of revellers were seen taking legal high nitrous oxide at the Hylands Park site in Essex - unaware of its potentially lethal effect, especially if used in confined spaces.

The gas, either carried in balloons or inhaled directly from a canister, leaves users feeling euphoric and relaxed with some people experiencing hallucinations.

Thousands of tonnes of rubbish including balloons and discarded metal canisters, which carried legal high nitrous oxide, are being collected by volunteers at V Festival

Nitrous Oxide, known as 'laughing gas' or 'hippy crack', is carried in balloons or inhaled directly from canisters

More than 72 people were arrested at this year's festival, including seven for selling 'legal highs' such as laughing gas.

Volunteers from St John Ambulance treated around 500 people over the course of the weekend and 10 people were taken to hospital.

With the last tired revellers heading home this morning, the operation to clear the Chelmsford site is well under way.

Police believe those taking nitrous oxide, legitimately used in dental work to numb pain, risk death as it restricts a person's intake of oxygen

Amongst the litter, there was overwhelming evidence of the increased use of laughing gas amongst festival goers. 

Scientists from the government's Centre for Applied Science and Technology will analyse samples of substances found at the Chelmsford event, including nitrous oxide.

One teenage festival-goer said: 'We're all using it. It's legal and makes you feel good, so what's the problem?

'There were loads of people doing it here - you only have to look at the amount of people carrying balloons around to realise that.

'It's safer than taking ecstasy and cheaper than cocaine so that's why it's everywhere.'

Essex Police, Essex County Council, Trading Standards and Chelmsford City Council issued a joint warning this week ahead of V Festival in Hylands Park and Brownstock Festival in Stow Maries. 

Donna Martin, substance misuse trainer for the Drug and Alcohol Partnership, said: 'I strongly urge festival-goers this summer to take the advice that legal highs could at best ruin your festival experience and at worst be fatal to you or your friends.'
