There's a new Instagram trend and it doesn't involve posting pictures of Hollywood abs after finishing a juice cleanse. Summer 2014 is officially the moment of the #Fatkini.

The #Fatkini is exactly what it sounds like, voluptuous women posting photos of themselves in bikinis to promote self-acceptance and love via the internet.

#Losehatenotwight coined by Virgie Tovar is another popular hashtag linked to the social media trend and is aimed at teaching women to love their bodies no matter what size they are, reports BuzzFeed.

Big risk:  Many women fear posting pictures of themselves on Instagram for fear they aren't perfect but #Fatkini hopes to change that all

The publication Colorlines spoke with a few popular plus-sized advocates and bloggers who explained why they decided to lose their insecurities and proudly display their bigger bodies.

'Fat people of all genders are just like, "We see it happening, we’re gonna do it, we’re gonna take selfies.'

Our other fat friends are gonna be so affirming and you have this little cocoon of love around you,' said #Fatkini advocate Laura Luna P.

In addition to building self-confidence, plus-sized participants of the Instagram frenzy hope that by creating tolerance for bigger women in bikinis they will fuel more people to design clothing for bigger bodies.

Green living: Instead of envying impossibly thin models, this girl is promoting self love by posting a curvier photo of herself in a swimsuit

'I remember walking in and seeing a two-piece bathing suit in the plus-size section and I started crying. It just became this symbol of a shift, it was so symbolic and meaningful, said #losehatenotweight creator Tovar.

Currently, affordable clothing chains like Forever 21 just started carrying sizes for larger women.

#Fatkini comes at a time when millions of Instagram users are obsessively looking at photos of celebrities and models and hoping to emulate them to an unhealthy extent.

The selfie movement heralded by Kim Kardashian and other celebrities has driven people to strive for the perfect selfie even if it means getting plastic surgery, as the Mail Online reported on in a story in March of this year.

A survey conducted by the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery found that one in three plastic surgeons saw an increase in people wanting facial procedures so they could look better online.
