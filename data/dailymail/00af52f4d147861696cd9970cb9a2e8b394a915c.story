On Thursday, the first victim of the crash was returned to her family, one of many painful reunions to come, as search crews struggled against wind and heavy rain to find more than 150 people still missing.

Police said body B001 was identified as Hayati Lutfiah Hamid by surgical scars, fingerprints, a necklace containing her initials, and a red name badge pinned to her uniform.

Her body, in a dark casket topped with flowers, was handed over to her family at a brief ceremony at a police hospital in Surabaya. A family member cried as she put both hands on the coffin.

Search teams have recovered two more bodies on Thursday, bringing the total to nine, after they resumed operations following bad weather which has so far hampered efforts.

Crews have been unable to investigate an object resting 100-165ft below the sea which is believed to be the remains of the Airbus A320-200, as officials have warned it could be a week before the plane's black box recorder can be recovered.
