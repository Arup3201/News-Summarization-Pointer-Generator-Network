Manchester United will not be pursuing a return for Nemanja Vidic.

Silvano Martina, the player's agent, refuted suggestions of a return to Old Trafford last week but reports continue to emanate from Italy that the former United captain is unsettled and yearning for a return to Manchester.

The 33-year-old is understood to be unhappy at being overlooked by Roberto Mancini and it is suggested they will have talks after the weekend. However, despite the Serb's discomfort, United have no plans to ride to the rescue.

They are intent on moving forward. Louis van Gaal continues to take stock of his current defenders and they are alive to fluctuations in the market with Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels struggling amid his club's current demise and Atletico Madrid open to offers for Diego Godin and Jose Gimenez.

The obstacle for the latter is in any proposed January sale would prompt an angry reaction from coach Diego Simeone hence the more likely nature of a summer deal when the Argentina is also expected to depart.

Juventus, meanwhile, have considered reviving interest in Radamel Falcao but they would struggle to meet the financial requirements.

Derby County are ready to launch an ambitious bid to sign Ross McCormack from Championship rivals Fulham.

The Scotland forward joined Fulham from Leeds for £11million in July but their poor start under Felix Magath has left them 10 points adrift of the promotion contenders.

They are willing to listen to bids for McCormack, who has scored five goals this season, and use the money to re-shape their squad.

Derby manager Steve McClaren has been looking to bolster his side to give them the edge in a tight promotion race.

They have money to spend and McClaren and his scouts have been looking at players in England and in Holland.

Fulham would want to recoup their outlay on McCormack but some of the fee to Leeds was based on them gaining promotion. Derby may plan to offer half the fee up front with more promised on their own promotion. Talks are expected soon.

Derby also want a winger with Blackburn Rovers' Ben Marshall understood to be a potential target. Marshall, 23, is also wanted by West Bromwich Albion among others.

West Ham United scouts attended Nantes against Bordeaux on Saturday to watch Ludovic Sane.

The centre back has been on Sam Allardyce's radar for 18 months and Hammers manager wanted further reports as he contemplates bringing in a new defender for January.

Scouts also watched Nicolas N'Koulou of Marseille a week ago and will view other potential targets this week.

Bordeaux defender Sane, 27, did not have the most impressive of afternoons, however, as Nantes won 2-1. 

French-born Sane is a Senegal player who can also play as a defensive midfielder and Allardyce wants cover with doubts remaining over Winston Reid, who has yet to agree a new contract.

Although Reid has plenty of interested clubs, it is understood no bids have yet been received.

Inter Milan have yet to firm up their interest in Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic.

The 21-year-old, who joined team-mates on their Christmas party at Manchester's Gorilla bar on Wednesday night, is surplus to requirements at the Etihad.

Inter coach and former City boss Roberto Mancini is a confirmed admirer but it is their city rivals AC Milan and German side Schalke who have shown the strongest interest so far.

The German side want cover with Arsenal monitoring Benedikt Howedes. Nastasic is available for around £10m but Milan would prefer an initial loan.

City will take stock of injuries to Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic before making any move in the January transfer market. All are expected to make full recoveries and City do not have immediate plans to buy but are wary of leaving themselves short in the title run-in.

New signings though would not be able to join their Champions League squad owing to restrictions to their submitted list laid down by UEFA.

City will resume talks with James Milner's representative, Matthew Buck of the PFA next month, but agreement over a new contract has yet to be reached.

Wigan Athletic's Ali Al-Habsi is one of the names at the forefront of Newcastle United's thinking as they push the Premier League to allow them to sign a goalkeeper on emergency loan.

Manchester United's Ben Amos is another under consideration, as is Mark Schwarzer at Chelsea.

Manager Alan Pardew said: 'It is something we might have to look at because there is no way that a 17-year-old that's our fourth-choice should be allowed to go in goal at this level.

'We will perhaps talk to the Premier League about Jak's situation.'

Harry Redknapp has travelled to Malaysia with Les Ferdinand to meet Queen Park Rangers' owners for talks about prospective transfers and plans for the season.

Although Redknapp would like Peter Crouch of Stoke City and Jermain Defoe from Toronto, the owners are unlikely to give the go-ahead for more veteran players on healthy contracts to join the Loftus Road club.

QPR are, however, showing a keen interest in Atletico  winger Cristian Rodriguez.

The Uruguay star, nicknamed 'The Onion', was a target for Sunderland last summer and QPR are hopeful of striking a loan deal.

Atletico are £400m in debt and want to trim  their wage bill. The 29-year-old Rodriguez has more than 80 caps and previously played for Porto, Benfica and Paris Saint-Germain.

Swansea City are in talks over a £2.5m deal for Colombia midfielder Alexander Mejia.

Manager Garry Monk wants the holding player to help protect his defence and club officials are working on a fee with Mejia's club Atletico Nacional.

They face competition from Mexican side Monterrey but Swansea are confident, with Nacional willing to accept the fee in two payments.

Monk hopes the work permit application for Mejia is also straightforward. The 26-year-old has 12 caps and is a regular in the Colombian squad.

Crystal Palace have been offered Morocco left back Achraf Lazaar.

The 22-year-old Palermo defender can also play as a left winger and Neil Warnock believes a deal could be done for £3m. 

Although he has six caps for Morocco, Lazaar moved to Italy with his family at the age of 11 and progressed through Varese's youth team.

Palace and Burnley have been offered the chance to sign AC MIlan's former Italy forward Giampaolo Pazzini, 30, next month.

Swindon Town are keen on Doncaster Rovers defender Jamie McCombe.

Manager Mark Cooper is looking to add experience to his squad as they head into the crucial stage of the season - pushing for automatic promotion to the Championship.

The 31-year-old McCombe is 6ft 4ins tall so would add physical presence but is also technically adept, to blend in with Cooper's footballing style.

Ipswich Town are weighing up a move for Charlton Athletic defender Morgan Fox.

The Tractor Boys want cover as they brace themselves for offers from Arsenal and Chelsea for £10m-rated Tyrone Mings.

Fox, 21, a Wales Under 21 defender, has progressed through the ranks at The Valley, was on loan at Notts County last year and has made 15 appearances for Charlton this season.

Tottenham Hotspur are not pursuing a deal for Porto striker Jackson Martinez.

Reports in Portugal on Thursday indicated that they are stepping up interest for the highly-coveted Colombia star. 

However, club sources say they have other targets and, with Martinez, 28, costing a minimum £27.5m transfer fee, plus the striker demanding £70,000 a week wages, Spurs do not want to go through the complication over who owns his playing rights.
