A treasure trove of more than 100 love letters sent from a lovestruck teenager to his sweetheart has brought the couple back together after more than 30 years apart.

Loraine Atkins, 47, received the first letter from Terry McGurk in 1982 when she was 16 while they were both pupils at The Queens School in Bushey, Hertfordshire. 

They dated for two years after meeting in the school playground and Terry wrote Loraine letters nearly every day. Some of the letters were more than 20 pages long.

Terry declared his undying love for his girlfriend time and time again. When he was 15 he wrote: 'I think I'm falling for you - I really mean it.'

The pair went their separate ways when Loraine left school a year ahead of Terry and got a job as a shopworker. 

They each went on to marry other people, but Loraine kept the letters as a keepsake of her first love, hiding them under her bed for more than three decades.

She said: 'The first letter that Terry sent to me was put in my locker, just to say hello. 

'As the letters came in I collected them in a tin box. As I grew older I didn't want to throw them away, so I still kept the box under my bed. 

'Terry was my first love, and the letters were a big part of my life.'

Other messages contained in the letters, which are dated from the early 1980s, include 'I can't bear another day without seeing you', 'I'll be dreaming of you' and 'I love you more than ever and will make sure we never split'. 

But faced with the question of what path she wanted her life to take after leaving school, Loraine dumped Terry in 1983 and the pair completely lost contact. 

She went on to marry another man in 2003 but by 2008 her marriage was in difficulties and she was facing divorce. 

In her sadness, she turned to the letters beneath her bed. 

She said: 'I wept as I re-read the heartfelt letters from all those years ago. I thought about all the time which had passed, and how happy I'd been with Terry.

'I realised I had to know how he was, what kind of person he'd become, what sort of life he was leading.' 

Loraine, an office administrator, took to Facebook and in October 2011 she found Terry, who was now living just 12 miles away. 

She did not know that school caretaker Terry, who had divorced in 2001 after an 11-year marriage, and who had been with a new partner since 2002, was also facing difficulties in his own relationship.

Terry, 46, said: 'When Loraine first contacted me on Facebook, I was excited, but I panicked. I was going through a messy break-up.

'I deleted my Facebook account and tried not to think about her, but after six months, I got back in touch. I couldn't help it, but she was always on my mind.' 

Loraine said: 'I had so many questions. It was great to talk to him, but I never imagined in my wildest dreams that we would get back together.'

From Terry: 'for a while there I thought you fancied Soggy. I was really jealous thinking I might lose you'

But as their conversations continued, Loraine found herself falling back in love with her long-lost boyfriend. 

'I was still technically married, but I knew Terry was the one for me. In my heart, I had known it all along.' 

The pair eventually arranged to meet and had a day out in Henley on Thames in April 2012.Terry said: 'I was nervous, but she brought along some of the letters I had written to her when I was in school. 

'I was flattered that she had kept them. It was as if we'd never been apart.' 

Loraine said: 'I knew instantly that I still loved him.

'As soon as I saw his cheeky smile I knew Terry was still the same man from all those years ago and my heart melted.

'He was all I had ever wanted. Why else would I have kept those letters? It sounds cheesy, but I knew he was the one for me.'

Loraine finalised her divorce and, six months after they reunited, Terry moved into her Watford home.

Their renewed relationship has the support of Loraine's mother Barbara and Terry's daughter April, 26. 

Although they are not yet engaged, Terry wasted no time in signalling his intentions in typical fashion - with a love note which he hid in her fridge. 

'To my fiancee-to-be,' the note said. 'I'm in love with you.'
