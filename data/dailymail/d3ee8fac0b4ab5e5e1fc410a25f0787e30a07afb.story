A US Customs and Border Protection helicopter stopped a boat believed to have been smuggling marijuana into the country by firing at a vessel that refused to yield.

The Blackhawk fired the rare warning shots near Catalina Island, 22 miles southwest of Los Angeles, after the suspicious boat was spotted by the Coast Guard after 10pm on Saturday.

The incident was the first time that shots had been fired at a boat from the air on the West Coast, Mitch Pribble, Director of Air Operations for CBP in San Diego, said.

A Coast Guard aircraft, two Border Patrol boats and the helicopter all followed the panga boat - a small fishing vessel about 22ft long - where crew could be seen throwing bales believed to be marijuana overboard.

The boat refused to yield, but 'stopped immediately' after the Blackhawk shot across its bow around 11pm.

US Customs and Border Protection said that protocol was followed to make sure the shots would not hurt the boating public.

'You always want a vessel to stop when they are first directed to do so. However, when a suspected criminal chooses to flee, the ability to fire those warning shots gives us another option,' Pribble said.

Marijuana smuggling gives billions of dollars to violent drug trafficking organizations, largely based in Mexico

The patrol boats caught up to the suspicious vessel after it stopped and took the three men on board into custody.

The agency also seized the panga boat and the Coast Guard helped look for the dumped goods.

The boat's seizure is part of an ongoing struggle to stop drug trafficking from Mexico into the United States, a business that makes billions of dollars and has caused gang violence near the southern US border.

Smugglers have used the waters near Catalina Island for their operations before. 

It is thought some smugglers transfer drugs from the panga boats to recreational vessels common at the popular sailing destination so that they can more easily ship the contraband onto the mainland.

One ton of marijuana worth $1million was confiscated from smugglers in 2012 after seven people were arrested trying to move the drugs onto a small sailboat near Catalina.

US border agents seized 23,335lb of marijuana at border crossings with Mexico in the fiscal year 2014. 

The illegal Mexican drug trade is thought to receive between $19billion and $29billion each year from US demand.
