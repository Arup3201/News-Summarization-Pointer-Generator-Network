Revisted: Comedian Tony Hancock was the main character in the 1950s sitcom. Lost episodes will be played in November to mark the 60th anniversary

It has long been revered as one of the most important British radio comedies of all time, yet the BBC still managed to mislay several episodes.

However now there is good news for fans of Hancock’s Half Hour, who will once again be able to listen to the travails of the struggling comedian and actor.

This November the BBC is to broadcast lost episodes of the classic 1950s sitcom on Radio 4, to mark the 60th anniversary of the show’s first transmission.

The Missing Hancocks will feature a new cast re-recording material from the original scripts, with Pirates of the Caribbean actor Kevin McNally playing the lead role as Tony Hancock.

Mr McNally, 57, has also played various parts in Doctor Who, Downton Abbey and Midsomer Murders.

Hancock’s Half Hour, which was originally broadcast on the BBC Home Service between 1954 and 1959, centered on a fictionalised version of Tony Hancock’s life.

He was joined by his dim Australian lodger, played by Bill Kerr, and dodgy businessman Sid, played by Sid James.

In all, 103 episodes were recorded and a TV version followed in 1956 which ran for five years and more than 60 episodes.

The programme was the first hit for writing partners Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, who went on to create Steptoe and Son.

They have chosen five out of the 20 missing episodes that will begin recording this evening at the BBC Radio Theatre in central London.

Star: Kevin McNally will play the lead character and will join a cast reading scripts from older episodes

The cast will also feature Simon Greenall, Kevin Eldon and Robin Sebastian.

The idea came about when series co-producer Neil Pearson, who was researching original Tony Hancock scripts for a rare book catalogue, found out many episodes had disappeared from the BBC archive.

He told the Guardian: ‘We will be re-creating as closely as possible the experience you would have had listening to your radio all those years ago. The scripts are perfect and timeless.

‘We will be recording the programmes in front of a live audience at BBC Radio Theatre and, rather thrillingly, the BBC Concert Orchestra will be re-recording the theme tune for the new series.’
