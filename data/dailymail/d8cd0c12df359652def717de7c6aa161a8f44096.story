A town judge on Tuesday refused to dismiss a drugged-driving case against Kerry Kennedy, ex-wife of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, clearing the way for a fall trial.

Kennedy ‘cut a wide swath of danger and risk’ when she was arrested in July after her Lexus swerved into a tractor-trailer near her home north of New York City, Justice Elyse Lazansky wrote in a ruling filed in North Castle Town Court.

The judge acknowledged Kennedy's public service but said a trial did not have to end that.

‘It is safe to say that Kerry Kennedy is not a typical criminal defendant. She has achieved a great deal and is dedicated to good works ... other gifted powerful and wealthy politicians and celebrities too numerous to mention have faced a wide variety of criminal charges and have gone on to do their jobs or serve the public in many important ways,’ Lazansky said.

No trial date was set, but a trial would be in October at the earliest.

Kennedy, dressed in a blue dress spangled with small white flowers, appeared dour as she stood outside the courthouse after the hearing flanked by her lawyer and one of her three daughters, as well as her sister-in-law, Molly Kennedy. 

When asked how Kennedy felt about the decision, defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt said Kennedy was ‘not happy about it, but it is what it is.’

‘We are very disappointed and we disagree with it, but we have every confidence that Ms. Kennedy will be exonerated,’ Lefcourt said.

Drugged driving: Kerry Kennedy was charged with driving under the influence in July and now says she accidentally took sleeping medication

Police said the daughter of the late 
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy failed sobriety tests. A small amount of a 
sleeping drug was found in her blood. She said she believed she 
accidentally took a sleeping pill that morning instead of thyroid 
medication.

Prosecutors had argued that dropping the charge would feed the perception that famous people are treated differently.

Kennedy
and her lawyers had argued in court papers that fairness demanded a 
dismissal. They said she took the sleeping pill accidentally and the 
only harm done was to Kennedy's own pride and her famous name.

They recounted her work for social justice and included a large file of glowing letters from friends and relatives.

Kennedy's
mother, Ethel Kennedy, wrote that ‘Human rights defenders in need from 
the tomato fields of Florida to the slums of Port au Prince, the desert 
of Western Sahara and the still homeless of New Orleans have come to 
rely on her compassion, keen insight, judgment and support.’

Other letters came from her brothers, sisters and in-laws, several priests and an assistant secretary of state.

Lefcourt
noted that the assassinations of Kennedy's father and uncle, President 
John F. Kennedy, meant Kennedy ‘experienced more tragedy by the age of 8
years old than most people experience in a lifetime.’

He
wrote that Kennedy's accident caused no injuries or damage to other 
vehicles, and ‘any harm is limited to the humiliation and embarrassment 
inflicted on Ms. Kennedy, and the damage to her reputation because of 
her community standing and family name.’

Justice Elyse Lazansky said in her ruling that going to trial will not prevent Kerry Kennedy from carrying on with her humanitarian work

However,
the Westchester County District Attorney's Office opposed a dismissal, 
saying that ‘would feed a public perception that people of wealth and 
privilege are treated differently than others.’

The
defense said that position held Kennedy to a higher standard ‘because 
of her family name and purported wealth and notoriety.’

Kennedy is due back in court October 8 for a pre-trial appearance. The judge has yet to set a trial date.

In court documents filed in March, 
Kennedy argued that she inadvertently took the drug zolpidem, a form of 
Ambien, instead of her daily thyroid medication, prior to the July 13 
incident.

The filing claims the two bottles 'are virtually identical in size, shape and appearance.'

Kennedy,
who was once married to New York governor Andrew Cuomo, crashed her 
Lexus into a tractor-trailer in North Castle, New York, at around 8am as
she was heading to the gym.

Police say the 53-year-old mother of three then fled the scene and was found at an exit ramp.

Kennedy failed a sobriety test and 
was allegedly slurring her words. A small amount of the sleep-inducing 
drug was found in Kennedy’s blood.

The driver of the vehicle that was 
struck by Kennedy's Lexus, 47-year-old Rocco Scuiletti, pleaded guilty 
last November to a count of disobeying a traffic device and was later 
fired from his job, Chappaqua-Mount Kisco Patch reported.

Letters
of support from famous family members and friends, including her mother
Ethel Kennedy, were all part of the 99-page motion.

“I
have too much regard for the lives of others, as well as my own, to 
place them at risk by driving under the influence of zolpidem,’ Kennedy 
wrote in an affidavit.

Equality before the law: Prosecutors opposed a dismissal of Kennedy's case, saying that would feed a public perception that people of wealth and privilege are treated differently than others

The Kennedy family has been prominent in the news in New York's northern suburbs over the past year.

Kerry Kennedy's sister-in-law and close friend, Mary Kennedy, hanged herself a year ago at her Bedford home.

Her
brother Douglas Kennedy was acquitted in November of child endangerment
and harassment charges stemming from a scuffle in a hospital maternity 
ward in Mount Kisco.
