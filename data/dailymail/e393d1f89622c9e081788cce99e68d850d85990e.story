The saga surrounding the body of radio DJ Casey Kasem appears to have taken another bizarre turn after reports emerged that his wife is making arrangements to have the body flown to Norway - against the wishes of his family.

Kasem, host of America's Top 40 and voice of animated television characters like Scooby-Doo's sidekick Shaggy, passed away in June at the age of 82 following a battle with dementia and Lewy body disease.

His declining health sparked a bitter family feud over his care and treatment.

Jean, his second wife of 34 years, had already been embroiled in a bitter row with his three children from his first marriage.

His daughter from a previous marriage Kerri and the rest of the Kasem family have no clue where Casey’s body has been taken.

It’s believed it was moved from a funeral home in Washington to one in Montreal, Canada.

Now TMZ, citing sources close to the family, reports Jean is planning to take the body abroad, possible to Oslo in Norway. 

On October 2013, Kasem’s children with his former wife, actress Linda Myers, as well as Kasem’s brother and a business associate, went public over their fears for his health.

The group held a protest outside Kasem’s home, alleging Jean wouldn’t let any of them see Casey and had been rebuffed in their efforts for three months.

In May 2014, Jean told a judge that Casey was no longer in the United States, however, he turned up several days later in Washington state.

On June 6, a Washington state court recognized the legal rights of Casey’s eldest children to see their father and gave daughter Kerri full conservator control of his affairs.

Haney & Young initially won a ruling on Jean’s behalf that same month, when a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordered the legendary broadcaster to continue to be cared for at the Washington state hospital.

That decision was reversed two days later when the judge authorised Kerri to remove her father from life support.
