Sex abuse campaigners have slammed a judge's decision to let a man who admitted to having sex with a 13-year-old girl walk free after only eight days in custody, saying race played a hand in the final sentence.

First-time offender Trent Maralunga, from the remote Northern Territory town of Maningrida, received a 16-month suspended sentence after he pleaded guilty to having sexual intercourse with person under 16 on April 8. Maningrida is located 500km west of Darwin.

He was granted bail eight days after he was arrested in April and the judge let Maralunga - who had a girlfriend at the time of the offence - walked free from the court on the same day he was sentenced. 

Being found guilty of having sexual intercourse with a minor can attract a sentence of up to 16 years in jail in the Northern Territory.

NSW Rape Crisis chief executive Karen Willis said the sentence sent the wrong message to offenders and coupled with previous cases it also showed sex crimes against indigenous people were not treated with the same seriousness as those involving those who were non-indigenous.

Trent Maralunga, 23, only served eight days for having sex with a girl known as TH who was 13 at the time

In his November ruling, Judge Graham Hiley told the state's Supreme Court that the victim, TH, was 'willing for you [Maralunga] to have sex with her'.

He also noted Maralunga - who was 19 years old in April - did not force himself on TH or cause her any physical harm.

'So I regard your offending on this occasion as towards the lower end of offending for this kind offence,' Judge Hiley said.

Maralunga was sentenced alongside another man who was involved in the same incident, Ziggy Williams.

Sex abuse campaigner Karen Willis said the sentence of Maralunga sent the wrong message to offenders and said: 'My guess is that if this girl was a white female the outcome would be different'

Williams - who was 22 years old at the time of the offence - was handed a six-month sentence for the less serious charge of indecently dealing with a person under 16, with some of it suspended.

He did not have sex with TH but he exposed his penis to the 13-year-old with the intention of having intercourse, but was stopped by the girl who said he was 'too old'.

A third man was also involved in the incident, which took place in a house that no one was living in at the time.

He cannot be named because he was 17 years old at the time of the crime.

The man pleaded guilty to having sexual intercourse with a minor and was given a sentence of 18 months, with some of it suspended.

Williams had only been in custody for four months when walked free on the same day he was sentenced, while the other man had been held in custody for seven months and was released the next day.

In his ruling, Judge Graham Hiley of the Northern Territory Supreme Court said the girl had been 'willing' to have sex with Maralunga

While Judge Hiley said Maralunga's punishment for having sex with a minor needed to 'warn all men that they must not have sex with people under the age of 16', Rape Crisis New South Wales' chief executive officer Karen Willis said this sentence did the exact opposite.

'Firstly any concept of having sex with 13-year-old child... is a crime,' Ms Willis told Daily Mail Australia.

'All children deserve to be safe and have a life free of violence, and the criminal justice system is one tool we have in protecting children. The other and far bigger is the adults in this country.' 

Ms Willis also believed the victim's cultural background played a part in the judge's final ruling.

'Another thing that is disturbing about this is that the girl and the offenders were [indigenous],' she said.

'My guess is that if this girl was a white female the outcome would be different. 

'I think that we really need to move away from concepts of a person’s cultural background when it comes to crime. 

'I wouldn't be surprised if there was similar examples of discriminatory sentencing in NSW.

'If a child is sexually assaulted, there has to be desperate justice involvement because it is a serious crime.'

But Ms Willis said the policing of sex crimes against children and domestic violence had gone through significant changes in the Northern Territory.

'They occupy more police resources than any other crime and they are the crimes we're not seeing an increase in. Police have undertaken training and procedural processes to change this. Northern Territory police are doing a great job,' she said.

Ms Willis told The Australian previous cases demonstrated sex crimes involving non-indigenous victims ended with more severe consequences in court than those with indigenous ones.

In 2007, six of nine men involved in a case where they raped a 10-year-old girl living in the indigenous shire of Aurukun in Queensland did not have convictions recorded against them.

Only three men were handed suspended sentences but a appeal later saw a majority of them serve time in prison.
