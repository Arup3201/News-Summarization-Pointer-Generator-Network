A computer hacker has been spared jail after selling virtual items he had stolen breaking into the accounts of fantasy game players.

Steven Burrell, from Northampton, spent 16 months hacking profiles on RuneScape, an online game where more than 200 million players live in a medieval fantasy world and collect armour and food.

The 21-year-old accessed accounts almost 4,000 times, using the money he made to pay off his gambling debts, Northampton Magistrates' Court was told.

Fantasy: Items similar to the type Steven Burrell, 21, stole from more than 100 players of the online game RuneScape. He sold his hoard of items like capes, swords, gold and armour on fan forums for up to £3,000

Popular: The game has run since 2001 and has more than 200 million users who 'train up' and fight monsters

Northampton Magistrates' Court heard Burrell sold his victims' virtual items on auction sites and forums to raise up to £3,000.

Many of his victims complained to the game's developer, Jagex - taking up 1,000 hours of the company's time.

RuneScape was launched by British brothers Andrew and Paul Gower in 2001 and has since become the largest online role-playing game in the world.

Its 200 million players gain skills like mining, cooking, fishing and fighting and collect hundreds of items ranging from lobsters to swords.

The most dedicated players are fiercely competitive and spend real-world money to help them gain fantasy 'skills' more quickly.

One user on sythe.org was selling 30 million gold pieces for $11.88 (£7.27) - a practice banned by administrators but hard to police.

Another sold a rare commemorative Christmas hat, which has no function other than kudos with the online community, for $40 (£25).

One full account for sale on eBay today had more than 25 bids topping £40.

But these amounts are chicken feed compared to the wealth of the game's founders - who together were ranked Britain's 740th richest people in this year's Sunday Times Rich List.

Andrew Gower, 34, sold his stake in the game for £88m in 2011 while Paul, 36, and his family retain a stake worth £14m.

Yet Burrell was charged with hacking, not theft, because the items he stole existed in a fantasy world.

Databases and password-cracking software were found 
on Burrell’s computer, which the court was told he went to 'great lengths' to hide.

The 21-year-old was cautioned in July 2012 by Yorkshire Police in 
relation to compromising a Facebook account of a Jagex employee.

He was then arrested in April this year, after which he emailed Jagex to apologise.

But he later hacked their game another 27 times, leading to a second arrest in July and criminal charges.

He pleaded guilty to two charges of unauthorised computer access after the court heard he accessed player accounts 3,872 times, modifying 105 accounts.

The game is the largest of its kind in the world.

Prosecutor Russell Tyner said: 'This activity relates to an online game called RuneScape.

'It is recognised as one of the largest games currently in existence, taking place in the realm of a medieval fantasy world.

'Players have characters and they acquire resources. They have a real-world value.

'What the prosecution say is Mr Burrell has acquired some of these unlawfully.

'To do this, he accessed other players’ accounts, and has gone on to sell the items on auction sites and forums.

'By
his own admission, he has made between £2,500 and £3,000. It is quite 
clear he has invested quite a lot of time and energy in this pursuit.

'His principal motivation was to gain 
kudos among people on the internet. Once a player has lost gaming 
resources, there is no redress.'

Kudos: Characters are respected in the online world for fantasy skills such as mining, fishing and cookery

Players trading for virtual money. The court heard Burrell was 'foolish' but made up to £3,000 in real money

Online world: The game is popular and has made its founders, British brothers Andrew and Paul Gower, £100m

Stuart Jeffery, defending, said Burrell was 'foolish' and used fantasy to deal with problems in the real world.

He added: 'He is a normal, rational human being, whose course of conduct has clearly caused a lot of trouble.

'He used a fantasy world to try to deal with problems in the real world, which were financial and related to gambling.

'It is clear he did not consider the long-term consequences because that world was not real.'

Burrell was handed a 12-month community order and made to perform 150 hours of unpaid work.

He was also ordered to pay £100 costs and a £60 victim surcharge, and to forfeit his two computers.

Another hacker was arrested for accessing RuneScape accounts in 2009 in what was, at the time, the first arrest of its kind.

And in May this year Kieron Belmont, 19, from Swansea, was given an eight-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £16 compensation to a friend whose RuneScape money he stole.

Burrell refused to comment outside court.
