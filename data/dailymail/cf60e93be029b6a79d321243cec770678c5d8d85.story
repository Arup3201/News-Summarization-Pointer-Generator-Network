A convicted killer who allegedly murdered and mutilated a teenage girl was arrested 30 years later after his 'terrible secret' was discovered following a DNA match, a court has heard.

Colin Campbell, 66, who is already serving a life sentence for the manslaughter of Deirdre Sainsbury, denies murdering Claire Woolterton in August 1981.

The 17-year-old’s naked body was found one morning on the promenade by the River Thames on Barry Avenue in Windsor, Berkshire, by a man on his way to work.

Killer: Colin Campbell pictured by police in 1981 is already serving a life sentence for the manslaughter of Deirdre Sainsbury but denies murdering Claire

Victims: Deirdre Sainsbury, left, was murdered in December 1984 and her body dumped on a golf course in  Buckinghamshire, it is believed that Campbell may also have killed Claire Woolterton, right three years earlier

Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said the teenager had been initially attacked at another, unknown, location and was found to show physical signs consistent with having been strangled into unconsciousness.

Addressing the jury at Reading Crown Court he recounted gruesome details of how she said she had then been sexually assaulted and then murdered.

He told jurors, who were shown photographs of the teenager’s body, they would hear evidence 'inevitably distressing and unpleasant to receive by way of detail.'

He added: 'You’re going to hear evidence of two terrible crimes in which two young women met an untimely and dreadful death.

'One of which the defendant has already admitted his responsibility for, namely Deirdre Sainsbury.

'At the time, DNA comparison didn’t even exist.

'For 32 long years the identity of her killer remained unknown, her murder unsolved. But her killer had left his mark on her body.

'Little did he know then the advances in medical science and scientific technology would eventually be his undoing.

Mr Wright told the court an 'adhesive tape lift' had been used on Claire’s body to take 'debris from the surface of her skin.'

It was then stored by police for 30 years until the case was reviewed in 2011.

The court heard that Claire, left, was last seen alive walking towards Hanwell after spending the evening in Ealing while 29-year-old Deirdre while hitchhiking in December 1984

Behind bars: Colin Campbell is currently serving a life sentence for the murder of Deirdre Sainsbury

He told jurors that expert scientists now believe the DNA discovered was 'one million times more likely to have been obtained from Colin Campbell', while another found it 'one billion times more likely.'

The court heard that Claire, who lived in Northolt, north west London, with her mother and her mother’s partner, was last seen alive at around 10pm on August 27 1981, walking towards Hanwell after spending the evening in Ealing with the older married man she was seeing.

Usually after meeting her he drove her home, dropping her off nearby.

Mr Wright went on: 'Sadly, on this night, she and he having had a disagreement, she decided to make her own way home and set off at around about 10 o’clock that evening.

'It was a journey, sadly, that she did not complete.'

Claire, who had left school at 16, was reported missing by her worried mother the next day. That evening she saw that a girl’s body had been found and realised it could be her daughter, the court heard.

Mr Wright said Campbell, who pleaded guilty to hitchhiker Ms Sainsbury’s manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, killed the 29-year-old in December 1984.

Her body was found in a wooded area of Denham Golf Course in Buckinghamshire, after Campbell picked her up in his car in Upper Richmond Road, Roehampton, on the evening of December 22.

Mr Wright told jurors there were many similarities between the two killings: both women had been mutilated with sharp instruments, both had their clothes removed by their attacker and both bodies had been left in public places where they could easily be found.

The trial continues tomorrow.
