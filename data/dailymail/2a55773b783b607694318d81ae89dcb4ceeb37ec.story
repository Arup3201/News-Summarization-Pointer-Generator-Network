These two lovebirds are really on an all time high.

Husband and wife Grant Engler and Amanda Volf have just tied the knot - in the world's first jet pack wedding

In the grandest of entrances the couple flew in to their ceremony each wearing a $100,000 (£63,000) Jetlev R200 water-powered jet pack system.

Landing on Newport Beach, California, they greeted their amazed wedding guests.

Tying the knot: The newly weds look happier than ever after being declared husband and wife following their unconventional service on Newport Beach, California

'Grant and I are kind of outdoorsy, adventurous-type people,' said bride Mrs Engler, originally from Weed, California.

'As you can imagine, to do something like this you'd have to be.'

To keep with tradition as closely as possible, Mrs Engler, 26, a sales assistant, wore white board shorts with a white veil and a surfing rash vest.

She landed on the beach next to father Roger who walked her down the aisle before giving her away.

Wedding vows: The couple zoom across the bay using the water-powered jet packs, with the groom flying higher than the bride who prefers to skim across the surface of the water

Groom Mr Engler wore a black wetsuit complete with a bow tie.

The whacky service took place at the seaside location yesterday afternoon.

After exchanging vows the newlyweds performed an airborne first dance - above the water - to Frank Sinatra's 'Come Fly With Me'.

The daring couple, from Grand Rapids, Michigan, became engaged on an adventure holiday to Mexico in April.

Their trip had been organised by adventure travel company Zozi.

Mad marriage: The couple hold hands as a registrar conducts the service, wearing a pair of equally extravagant green glasses fit for the occasion

You may kiss the bride: After all the splashing around in the sea, the couple get to the highlight of the ceremony and seal the ceremony with a kiss

The wedding picture: Most people are surrounded by the ornate architecture of a church, but Mr and Mrs Engler's wedding picture will be that of sea and wetsuits

Still time for tradition: The now Mrs Engler throws her bouquet to relatives watching the service

Audience: Friends and relatives - some of whom were concerned about the extreme wedding - look on teary-eyed as the couple are married

Wedding dance: The couple have the equivalent of a jet pack dance on the water, to the sound of Frank Sinatra's Come Fly With Me

And
it was 25-year-old hotel manager Mr Engler's choice of T-shirt - one 
bearing a Zozi logo during his proposal to his beloved partner - that opened 
the door to their bizarre service this week.

He
had enlisted a stranger to photograph his proposal on the Mexican 
shoreline and later sent his picture to the adventure company to say 
thanks for providing the perfect setting.

The company later approached the pair and offered them the chance to wed by jet pack.

Zozi's offer was eventually was accepted - but not before some cautious words from Mr Engler's new in-laws - parents Roger and Anna.

Beaming bride: Mrs Engler is all smiles at the wedding. Her white surfing vest provided an alternative to a flowing white dress

Mrs Engler poses with her mother Anna who was initially quite reluctant for her daughter to be married wearing a jet pack, but came round to the idea after being assured it was safe

Together: The couple stroll along the beach, with the groom in his black wetsuit and white bow tie

'They were kind of quiet,' said Mrs Engler. 'They were curious if it was safe.'

She added: 'They're not ultra conservative, but they just didn't want to miss out on any of the traditions that as parents I'm sure they were looking forward to once I was engaged.'

The Jetlev R200 retails at an introductory price of $99,500, according to Jetlev's website.

The jet pack ostensibly straps to the user, and is connected by a 30-foot hose to a boat unit that feeds water to power the device.
