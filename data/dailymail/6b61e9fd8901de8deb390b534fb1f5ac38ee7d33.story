A 20-year-old, father-to-be has been arrested for the attempted murder of his teenage girlfriend and their unborn baby. 

Raheem Wright, 20, allegedly took his girlfriend, 16, for a walk along a remote Mississippi river path and had his friend, 17-year-old Shalik Allen, lie in wait on top of a levee with a gun.

The pregnant teen, who has not been identified, was shot in the neck, chest and back, according to  New Orleans police in an arrest warrant on Tuesday.

The suspects then fled, leaving the 16-year-old for dead, according to the warrant written by Detective Robert King Jr and seen by NOLA.

The victim, from Gretna, managed to run to a nearby home where the owner called 911.

She was taken to hospital in a critical condition and was unable to speak following the shooting. Both she and her unborn baby have now been stabilized, police said.

When interviewed by detectives about the shooting, the young woman was able to give the police a thumbs-up when asked if her boyfriend had been involved in her murder attempt. She also confirmed the identity of Allen.

Both suspects were booked on Tuesday on attempted second-degree murder and attempted first-degree feticide.

They are being held at Orleans Parish Prison on half a million dollars bond.
