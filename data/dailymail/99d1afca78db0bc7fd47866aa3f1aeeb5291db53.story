Remarkable moments often win big matches but Leeds Rhinos winger Ryan Hall claims he will never remember his.

Hall is one of rugby league’s most incredible athletes. Built like a prop forward, the England international possesses a dexterity that belies his enormous frame.

Sometimes, though, it’s brute strength and force of will that get you through and that is how it was on Saturday at Wembley as two bulldozing tries — both from standing starts — enabled Leeds to end a run of six Challenge Cup final defeats by beating Castleford in the sport’s showpiece.

‘Out there you don’t think about individual things, you just want to do what is best for the team,’ said Hall. ‘I can’t remember the second try. I will have to watch it on video to realise what really happened.

‘At the time you do it and then you are, like: “What’s going on? How have I done that?”,’

Hall, 26, is one of the brightest players in Super League. He knows, therefore, that when coach Brian McDermott calls him a ‘freak’ it’s a compliment.

One of the best: Hall, dubbed among the world's finest wingers say his team-mates, described scoring tries at Wembley as 'magical'

‘He has called me that before,’ he smiled. 

‘Everyone has attributes and these are mine. I play the hand I have been dealt. I am a robust guy and I make the most of it.’

Hall pipped team-mate Danny McGuire to the Lance Todd Man of the Match trophy. While Hall honoured his media commitments, McGuire lay in hospital with three busted ribs.

Castleford were not at their best on their big day and coach Daryl Powell will always regret that. ‘We got rattled and I don’t know why,’ he admitted.

Leeds led early through Tom Briscoe and were never caught. 

A try from second row Oliver Holmes brought Castleford to within six points early in the second period but Hall left three opponents on the floor to stretch Leeds’ advantage again in the 67th minute and a McGuire drop goal finished things off.

Rhinos forward Jamie Jones- Buchanan said: ‘Sometimes it’s good to have no common sense. Ryan hasn’t got any. 

'He just steamrolls everybody and puts that ball down. He is phenomenal. He’s a world-class athlete.’
