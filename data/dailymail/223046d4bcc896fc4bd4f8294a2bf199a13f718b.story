Caterham have been given dispensation to compete in 2015 with this year's car should a buyer be found for the team.

The key decision was taken during last week's Formula One Commission meeting in Geneva, and allows administration-hit Caterham an opportunity to be on the grid next year.

For a potential purchaser it now means there is no pressure to build a car for 2015, particularly as time is of the essence, and all the inherent costs that would apply.

With the decision to be ratified by this week's meeting of the World Motor Sport Council in Doha, it would allow a new owner to at least be in F1 with a base on which to build for 2016.

Caterham will be allowed to compete in the 2015 Formula One season should they find a new buyer

Speaking to Press Association, administrator Finbarr O'Connell said: 'The F1 Commission and FIA agreed if it would assist the weaker teams they can use the 2014 car next year, so giving them more time and options.

'That is of interest to all the parties I'm talking to because it gives them a choice, an easier start to get into F1 if they chose that route. It helps.'

Following Leafield-based Caterham's appearance at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi last month, O'Connell had stated a deal before Christmas was crucial if the team were to survive.

The F1 Commission's decision has now taken some of the burden off of O'Connell to conclude a sale prior to the festive season.

'Before Christmas would still be ideal,' added O'Connell.

'It now doesn't have to happen by then, but the earlier the better from my point of view, and I'm encouraging people as much as I can.

'It's a very difficult purchase decision for any party because of the huge costs involved in running a F1 team.

'I'm still talking to a few interested parties, and I'm hoping one of them can do the deal.

'The number of people I'm talking to has increased, with two very strong candidates, and a third less strong.

'All I can do is show what I have, show the team, the assets and the facilities, and facilitate in any way I can with them making a decision.

'I remain confident something will be done.'
