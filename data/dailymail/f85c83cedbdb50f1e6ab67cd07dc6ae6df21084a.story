Police say they arrested a man in Delaware who had 15,000 baggies of heroin in his car during a traffic stop.

Delaware State Police say troopers pulled over 32-year-old Davon Tucker of Paterson, New Jersey, on Tuesday for speeding in Milton.

A trooper asked Tucker about an odor of marijuana. Police say Tucker then handed over a plastic bag of pot.

During a search of the car, police say troopers found 15,000 small, wax-paper baggies containing heroin worth about $150,000 in the trunk. 

The baggies are slightly bigger than postage stamps and weighed 225 grams in total.

Master Cpl. Gary Fournier says the heroin bust is among the department's largest during a routine traffic stop.

Tucker is being held on multiple drug charges. It's unclear whether he has an attorney.

He could face up to five years in jail and a fine of $10,000 if found guilty.
