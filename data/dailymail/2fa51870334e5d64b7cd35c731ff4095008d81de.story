Playing and splashing about, these polar bears took to their new home like, well, polar bears to water.

Entertaining themselves at Copenhagen Zoo, Denmark, this pair have been spotted diving through the pool and enjoying breakfast in their swish new pad.

Ivan, an eight-year-old male and Noel, a
10-year-old female, have shown off their fun side since the move, according to senior adviser Frank Rønsholt, who took the pictures.

The new enclosure, nicknamed the Arctic Circle, means visitors can see the magnificent creatures up close from the glass tunnel under the bears' pool

Noel and Ivan, two polar bears at Copenhagen Zoo, love exploring their new enclosure which gives them more room for playtime

He said: 'Playing like this is not something that 
they ever seemed to do in their old enclosure, so you can clearly see 
that the polar bears are enjoying their new habitat.

'The new enclosure for these bears is 6 metres deep, and we are able to see them from only 17 centimetres away.

'It's great because they can now see us as closely as we can see them, and they seem to absolutely love it.'

Polar bears are often regarded as marine mammals, spending most of their time at sea, so it's no surprise that Ivan and Noel were keen to get in the water.

With male polar bears growing as long as 10ft and females reaching between six to eight feet long, they need lots of room when it comes to play time.

The bears live in the new enclosure, named the Arctic Circle, along with North Atlantic birds and seals.

Visitors will be able to see the bears up close from a glass tunnel under the pool.

At 3,200sqm, the Arctic Circle is not only far bigger than the existing enclosure, but will be able to satisfy the bears' urges to dig and seek food on land and in the water.

No wonder these polar bears were thrilled to check out their new surroundings.

Mr Rønsholt said: 'The bears were playing around with ease, it was almost like watching ballet.

'It was very impressive to see them act so calm.'
