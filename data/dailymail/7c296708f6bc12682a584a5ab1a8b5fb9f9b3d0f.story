A mother who drowned her two young children in a bathtub in Canada has jumped to her death from a bridge in Australia just months after being released.

Allyson McConnell, 35, was deported back to her native Australia in April after serving just 10 months in Alberta for the killings of two-year-old Connor and 10-month-old Jayden in 2010.

On Wednesday, McConnell's Canadian lawyer said police were in little doubt the body found beneath the Brain McGowan Bridge in West Gosford was his former client, as she had identification papers with her.

The body was found washed up on some rocks by a passerby at 11am local time on Tuesday. Police said that a former identification would be released on Friday.

McConnell, who had suffered from a long history of depression and suicide attempts, had previously said she did not want to get well and would continue to try to take her life.

Her murdered sons were found by their father, Curtis McConnell, in their home in 2010. At the time, the couple was going through an acrimonious divorce and custody battle.

The day the boys were found, McConnell seriously injured herself jumping 
off a freeway overpass.

At the trial last year, a judge found McConnell not guilty of the second-degree murder of her young sons but guilty of their manslaughter, and sentenced her to six years in prison.

McConnell spent just 10 months in the Alberta hospital psychiatric ward after the courts reduced the length for time served.

Keeping quiet: After arriving back in the country, she stayed with her mother and was largely reclusive

Appeals were lodged against the verdict and sentence, and her husband had said he hoped she would be forced to stay in Canada until they were heard - but she was deported.

She was pictured ashen faced as she arrived in the airport in Sydney earlier this year and returned to her mother's home in Gosford.

Peter Royal, the lawyer who represented McConnell in Canda, said he spoke with McConnell's mother early Wednesday morning, CBC reported.

He said the news was 'very depressing' and that he remembered her as vulnerable.

'I won't ever forget the evidence she gave in court,' he said. 'It was very moving and upsetting. She didn't see any future and believed she would continue to try to kill herself.'

Ill: McConnell tried to kill herself on the day the bodies were found but survived jumping from a bridge

Happier days: Curtis McConnell still lives in Alberta and had been fighting for his ex-wife to face greater penalties

Robert Ovadia, a senior reporter with Seven News in Sydney, told CBC that McConnell had been reclusive since arriving in Australia.

'She hasn't been on any sort of watch list from authorities or any sort of scrutiny whatsoever,' Ovadia said.

'Her history of suicide attempts is obviously very well-documented. I'm told that she has expressed suicidal thoughts since arriving home as well. So as sad as it to say, I guess that today seems somewhat of an inevitable conclusion.'

McConnell had said in court that her 
suicide attempts began when she became pregnant by her father when she 
was 15. She later suffered a miscarriage and told no one about it, she 
said.

A psychiatrist had testified McConnell had likely meant to kill herself, but was so close to her children that she considered their lives extensions of her own, CBC reported.

'Mental illness makes victims of all,' 
Alberta's deputy premier, Thomas Lukaszuk, tweeted on Tuesday evening. 'Sad 
end to what already was a tragedy.'
