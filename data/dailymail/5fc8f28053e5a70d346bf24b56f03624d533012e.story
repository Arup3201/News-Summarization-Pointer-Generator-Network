The Queen today gave England and Australia's cricketers a treat as she turned up at Lord's to meet the batsmen and bowlers lined up ahead of today's Ashes Test match.

The monarch walked out onto the cricket ground's famous pitch to greet the players, set to go head to head in the eagerly anticipated match.

Wearing a sky blue dress with neat white jacket with contrasting trim, the Queen topped off the elegant ensemble with a statement bonnet in a vivid blue.

The
famous ground is the home of cricket and is owned by Marylebone Cricket
Club (MCC) - the guardians of the laws and spirit of the game.

Smiling: The Queen looked to be enjoying the tour of the famous cricket ground - which she visited after travelling back from a tour of Kendal in Cumbria this morning

Elegant: The Queen wore a bright blue straw hat for the occasion - appropriate given the temperatures in London were forecast to reach 30c

It will celebrate its bicentenary next year after being established by cricketer and businessman Thomas Lord in 1814.

As the last of the sell-out crowds 
took their seats for the second Test, England captain Alistair Cook 
introduced the Queen to his players.

Among the team were the leading 
performers of the first Test at Trent Bridge which England won - bowler 
Jimmy Anderson, who took the last wicket in a nailbiting finish, and 
batsman Ian Bell, who scored a century.

The tourists were 15 runs from victory when their last player was dismissed by the home side .
But Australian have discovered their own star in 19-year-old spinner 
Ashton Agar, who made 98 runs on his Test debut, the highest Test score 
by a number 11 batsman.

solo: The Queen usually makes her traditional visit to Lord's during 
the Ashes with keen cricket fan Prince Philip, but as he is currently 
convalescing at Windsor she went alone

The Queen got to grips with cricket’s controversial new system for deciding if players are out or not - thanks to the England women’s captain.

Charlotte Edwards found herself explaining to the Queen the hotly disputed decision review system (DRS) when the monarch visited Lord’s cricket ground in central London to watch the second Ashes Test.

With keen cricket fan the Duke of Edinburgh convalescing at Windsor Castle after his recent operation, the Queen had made her traditional trip to meet the teams alone.

When she last attended an Ashes test at Lord’s in 2009 two quick Australian wickets fell and later the Aussies suffered a batting collapse.

But this time England were the side losing wickets - three in around 15 minutes including the captain Alastair Cook.

Smiles: The Queen met the players before start of play of the second Ashes test match between England and Australia

Former Australian prime minister John Howard was sat next to the Queen in the pavilion and he could not contain his excitement when Cook’s wicket fell and clapped enthusiastically.

When England batsman Joe Root was given out leg before wicket the decision was referred to a third umpire behind the scenes who used technology to check the decision.

The England women’s captain talked the Queen through what was happening as images showing the heat marks left by the ball on the batsman’s bat and were screened for the sell out crowds.

The sportswoman, who in a few weeks will lead her players against Australia in the women’s Ashes series, said: “I was trying to explain the DRS and I think she understood it.

'I was telling her if the ball hits the pad first its out, even if the ball goes on to hit the bat.

Respect: The Queen shakes hands with England's Kevin Pietersen at Lord's Cricket Ground, London

'Having her here makes it an extra special day, the excitement around the ground this morning grew when she arrived.'

Philip’s absence was missed by senior figures from the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) - the guardians of the laws and spirit of the game - which owns Lord’s.

But the Duke appears to be making good progress after last month’s exploratory abdominal surgery as Buckingham Palace said he would travel from Windsor Castle to join the Queen in Scotland during August.

The Queen will be travelling to Balmoral for her traditional summer break next week but it is not thought Philip will be among her party.

When the Queen first arrived at Lord’s she met the players on the pitch chatting briefly to the two sides.

The famous ground is the home of cricket and will celebrate its bi-centenary next year after being established by cricketer and businessman Thomas Lord in 1814.

The Queen, the MCC’s patron, met senior officials from the world of cricket in the pavilion’s committee room before settling down to watch some of the morning’s play.

Her trip was hosted by MCC president Mike Griffith, who regretted that Philip could not make the visit.

He said: 'It’s a shame the Duke could not be here, I guess he’s watching it at home.'He was our president twice, first in 1949 and then in 1974 but it’s wonderful to have the Queen here.'

It was a busy day for the monarch, 
who had earlier paid a visit to the Cumbrian town of Kendal where she 
was met by thousands of well-wishers lining the streets in the sunshine.

Hand shaking: Queen Elizabeth II was introduced to all of the players in both teams before the game began

Delighted: Members of both teams were seen to be ecstatic to have met Her Majesty
