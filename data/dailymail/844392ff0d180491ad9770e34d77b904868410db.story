South Sydney hooker Issac Luke will miss Sunday's NRL grand final against Canterbury after the judiciary upheld his one-match ban for a dangerous throw.

Luke bowed his head and looked at the floor after the verdict was read out by judiciary panel member Mal Cochrane, who spent 11 minutes deliberating with the two other panel members Chris McKenna and Michael Vella on Tuesday night.

Judiciary chairman Paul Conlon echoed the thoughts of all Souths fans, officials and players when he immediately addressed Luke.

'We all know what that means,' he said. 'It is very unfortunate.'

Luke was hit with the charge following a 38th minute tackle on Sydney Roosters forward Sonny Bill Williams in the Rabbitohs' 32-22 preliminary final win over the premiers at ANZ Stadium on Friday

'The position player Williams was put in meant his head or neck could have been the first contact point with the ground' judiciary prosecutor Peter Kite said

Luke declined to comment as he left League Central following the decision.

Rabbitohs coach Michael Maguire didn't answer questions from the phalanx of reporters and cameramen assembled but only gave a short statement.

'Obviously not the result we were after,' Maguire said.

'But I know I have a squad that are looking forward to preparing well all week and getting into Sunday's game.'

Penrith-bound back-up rake Api Koroisau filled in capably for Luke earlier this year when the 27-year-old suffered a shoulder injury, and is likely to be called upon again to fill his role in the decider.

Luke was hit with the charge following a 38th minute tackle on Sydney Roosters forward Sonny Bill Williams in the Rabbitohs' 32-22 preliminary final win over the premiers at ANZ Stadium on Friday.

With the guilty verdict, Luke is hit with 200 penalty points, with 100 points equalling a one-match suspension, meaning he will also miss the Kiwis' opening Four Nations match against Australia in Brisbane on October 25.

From the outset judiciary prosecutor Peter Kite argued the tackle on dual international Williams was 'a classic grade one dangerous throw'.

'There was an unacceptable risk of injury,' he continued.

'The position player Williams was put in meant his head or neck could have been the first contact point with the ground.

'A dangerous position was achieved.'
