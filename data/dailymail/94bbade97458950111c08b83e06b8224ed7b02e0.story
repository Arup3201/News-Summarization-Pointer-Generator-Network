British scientists are tracking an iceberg eight times the size of Manhattan in a groundbreaking bid to prevent a disaster.

Experts are monitoring the massive iceberg - which broke off a glacier in Antarctica - following fears it could drift into world shipping lanes.

The giant iceberg measures roughly 270 square miles (700 square km).

The huge chunk of ice could survive for a year or more and the researchers hope to stop it becoming a hazard by predicting the path it will take.

Icebreaks around this size split from glaciers on average every two years worldwide, but this is the first tracking attempt of its kind.

Using satellite technology, it’s being funded by a 50,000 pound urgency grant from The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

Expert Dr Robert Marsh, from Ocean and Earth Science at the University of Southampton, Hamphire, is investigating as part of the project.

He says the iceberg could cross into a ship’s path in the Southern Ocean.

Dr Marsh said: 'The primary reason to monitor the iceberg is that it’s very large.

An iceberg is a large chunk of frozen of freshwater ice that has broken off a glacier or an ice shelf and is floating freely in open water.

The word 'iceberg' has its roots in the Dutch word 'ijsberg' which means 'ice mountain'.

Because of the density of pure ice is lower than that of sea water, typically only one-ninth of the volume of an iceberg floats above water.

In addition to this, the shape of the underwater portion can be difficult to judge by looking at the portion above the surface.

When a piece of iceberg ice melts, it makes a fizzing sound called 'Bergie Seltzer'.

This sound is made when the water reaches ice that contains trapped compressed air bubbles.

As this happens, each bubble bursts, making a 'popping' sound. The bubbles contain air trapped in snow layers very early in the history of the ice, that eventually got buried to a given depth (up to several km) and pressurised as it transformed into firn then to glacial ice.[

'An iceberg of this size could survive for a year or longer and it could drift a long way north in that time and end up in the vicinity of world shipping lanes in the Southern Ocean.

'There’s a lot of activity to and from the Antarctic Peninsula, and ships could potentially cross paths with this large iceberg, although it would be an unusual coincidence.'

The team will use their results to more accurately model the paths of future large icebergs.

These are likely to become more common as global warming encourages glacier calving - where ice breaks off of the end of a glacier.

Investigators from Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, are tracking the iceberg using earth observation satellites TerraSAR-X from the German Space Agency (DLR).

Principal investigator Professor Grant Bigg says large amounts of freshwater from the melting iceberg could affect ocean currents.

Prof Bigg, of the University of Sheffield, said: 'If the iceberg stays around the Antarctic coast, it will melt slowly and eventually add a lot of freshwater that stays in that coastal current, altering the density and affecting the speed of the current.

An iceberg twice the size of Manhattan (ringed) tore away from one of Greenland's largest glaciers in July last year. Nasa satellites revealed when broke away completely, freeing an iceberg measuring 46 square miles

'Similarly, if it moves north it will melt faster but it could alter the overturning rates of the current as it may create a cap of freshwater above the denser seawater.

'This glacier is not large enough to have a big impact, but it could have an effect.

'Particularly if these events become more common, there will be a build-up of freshwater which could have lasting effects.'
