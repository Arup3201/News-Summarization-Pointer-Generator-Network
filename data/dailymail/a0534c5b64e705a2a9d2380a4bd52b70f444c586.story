West Brom legend Laurie Cunningham's historic first England cap is to be sold at auction to raise money towards the Celebration Statue in the town centre.

Cunningham, who was previously the first black player to represent England at any level after playing for the Under 21s, won the first of his six international caps against Wales at Wembley in 1979.

Cunningham's mother Mavis gave the cap to local businessman Jim Cadman who is determined to give supporters an opportunity to see it before it is put up for sale in late summer.

Speaking to the Birmingham Mail, he said: 'The family are absolutely delighted with the statue and she told me we could have a cap.

'To then discover it was his first cap is extraordinary. When it comes to memorabilia it is a real piece of history.

'It is far too valuable to auction off straight away, so having spoken to the PFA and Cyrille Regis and Brendon Batson we want the fans to see it first.

'We will take it on a mini tour with the help of the Albion Supporters Club and then auction it in the late summer early autumn with all the proceeds going to the final phase of the statue funding.'

Cunning scored 21 goals in 86 appearances for the Baggies as part of the so-called 'Three Degrees' alongside Cyrille Regis and Brendan Baston before being sold to Real Madrid where he won the La Liga and Copa del Rey double in 1979-80.
