It turns out there is a reason raccoons are masked like bandits.

Like a seasoned burglar, this crafty critter manages to outsmart a homeowner and steal food from a trap that was set up to catch it.

A night vision camera shows the determined raccoon as it carefully slips its dexterous front paws through the bars of the metal cage and grabs a bowl containing its eventual late-night snack.

Moments after sniffing around and surveying its surroundings to make sure the coast was clear, the wild animal tips over the container, spilling some of the food into its paws, and begins to chow down without stepping foot in the trap.

It turned out to be a futile attempt to catch the pesky home invader.

Martin Sebastion, from the Canadian province of Manitoba, filmed the moment on a night vision camera that he left in his attic.

The furry intruder has been living in Martin's home for weeks but has managed to elude capture despite repeated attempts to trap it.
