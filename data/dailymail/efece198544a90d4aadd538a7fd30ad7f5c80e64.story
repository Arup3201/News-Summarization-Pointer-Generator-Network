Council worker Maria Spruce, 40, spent £3,500 of taxpayers' money on iPads, phones a laptop for her 'spoilt' son

A disgraced council worker who used taxpayers' cash to go on a £3,500 spending spree on iPads and mobile phones for her 'spoilt' teenage son has been spared jail.

Maria Spruce, 40, was trusted with a local authority credit card but used it to buy the top-of-the-range products and a laptop computer.

Town hall bosses at Wolverhampton City Council became suspicious while Spruce, an electoral registration assistant, was on a three-week holiday to Australia last November.

They discovered that she had made 47 unauthorised purchases on the card, totalling £3,517, over a six-month period last year.

Spruce admitted once count of fraud by position but was spared jail when she appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Friday.

She was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.

Judge John Warner said: 'You had been trusted with the credit card but used it in a dishonest way.

'I accept that you were under pressure at home in relation to your son but many people have those sorts of pressures but get on with their life without resorting to dishonesty.'

The court heard that Spruce, of Bilston, in the West Midlands, bought the items for her son who was 'very controlling and aggressive'.

Prosecutor Joanne Barker said: 'A colleague covering the duties of the defendant opened a credit card statement and saw it had been used for purchases that were not legitimate office business.

'She told her employer that she had bought the items for her son who was very controlling and could be aggressive towards her.'

Wendy Miller, defending, said: 'This was not a sophisticated fraud and was always going to be detected.

'She was trying to satisfy her only son who is difficult to control. The items bought for herself were few and far between.'

The court was told that her son is now living with his father and Spruce will have to sell her house because she is unable to pay the mortgage after losing her job.

A former neighbour of Spruce said: 'She bent over backwards for her son. He was very spoilt but she never gave him the discipline he needed.

'She probably felt guilty about being a single mum but she allowed herself to be completely manipulated by him.'

Speaking after the sentencing, Wolverhampton councillor Paul Sweet said the sentence sent out a 'strong message'.

'The city council operates a zero tolerance policy on fraud and corruption and takes all allegations of fraudulent activity made to us extremely seriously,' he said.

'We will not hesitate to take action if we suspect fraud has been committed against the council - and, as a result, taxpayers - and we will make every effort to recover all monies stolen from the council.'
