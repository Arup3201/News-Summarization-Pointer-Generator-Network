BT is in talks to buy back mobile firm O2 in a £10billion deal that would give it an unprecedented share of the telecoms market.

The former state-owned monopoly already offers TV services and is the largest provider of landlines and home internet in the UK.

Now it wants to add the mobile phone business in order to offer consumers a single package of all four services – known in the industry as ‘quad-play’.

BT has raised its £2billion move into sports TV – including a weekly chat show starring Clare Balding – by raising the price of line rental by 6.5 per cent last year to £15.99 a month – or £191.88 a year

BT confirmed yesterday it was also in talks with EE, which is Britain’s biggest mobile provider with 27million customers.

However, experts warned that any such deal could lead to price rises for some households as BT seeks to fund discounts in other parts of the business.

O2’s owner, Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica, yesterday confirmed talks were going on, although BT said discussions are at a ‘highly preliminary stage’. O2, which has more than 24million users, was owned by BT under the Cellnet brand before it was sold a decade ago. Any buyout is likely to require clearance by European competition watchdogs.

If it goes ahead, it is likely BT would then try to sell other products from across its business to mobile customers – increasing its size even further.

Imran Choudhary, senior analyst at research group Kantar Worldpanel, said: ‘Acquiring one of the largest networks in the country would give it instant access to an established customer base, allowing it to tap into and cross-sell its internet, TV and landline packages.’

BT is likely to face a hefty bill in the spring when the next auction for the rights to show Premier League matches takes place

Some analysts have claimed that the move could see prices for consumers drop. James Barford, of Enders Analysis, said those who signed up for so-called quad play services in France and Spain were offered ‘deep discounts’.

But there are also fears that existing BT customers could see prices rise as the firm raises the cash to pay for discounts in other areas.

The company already offers phone lines to ten million homes and has almost a third of all home broadband customers in the UK, while more than a million households also pay to take TV from the group. 

But it has funded its £2billion move into sports TV – including a weekly chat show starring Clare Balding – by raising the price of line rental by 6.5 per cent last year to £15.99 a month – or £191.88 a year.

It is also likely to face a hefty bill in the spring when the next auction for the rights to show Premier League matches takes place. Ernest Doku, of price comparison site uSwitch, warned that the creation of a large player in the market could have a ‘significant impact’.

He said: ‘There are so many different bundles available that it can be hard to compare providers, and subsequently know if you are getting a good deal.

‘It will be down to them to ensure packages are clear, transparent and competitively priced for customers if quad play is to succeed.’ BT has faced criticism over its dominance of the physical network of cables that runs across the country. Openreach – the national grid of phone and internet lines – is owned and run by BT but has been criticised for its pricing.

EE – which was formed from Orange and T-Mobile – is jointly owned by France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, which want to sell the business.

Future market leader? A takeover frenzy among telecoms and mobile companies has been sparked after it emerged that BT is in talks to buy either O2 or EE
