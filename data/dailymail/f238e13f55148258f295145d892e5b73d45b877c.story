It seems that the subject matter of the Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview was a problem at Sony long before they were hacked by a group hoping to stop the film's release. 

In emails that were leaked on Thursday, Sony Corporation Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai writes Amy Pascal asking that scenes from the movie featuring Jong-un be removed or edited.

Pascal then shares this information with the film's star, writer and director, Seth Rogen, who is none too happy.

'This is now a story of Americans changing their movie to make North Koreans happy,' wrote Rogen in an email to Pascal obtained by Bloomberg News.

'That is a very damning story.'

Pascal tried to explain herself to Rogen, saying; 'As embarrassing as this has been from my point of view, you have to appreciate the fact that we haven't just dictated to you what it had to be.'

She then adds, 'This isn't some flunky. It's the chairman of the entire Sony Corporation who I am dealing (with).'

Indeed, in one email, Hirai tells Pascal: 'I’ve given this a lot of thought and would like to go ahead with a variation of version 337. 

'It would be much appreciated if you could push them a bit further as you mentioned in your e-mail. Also, please ensure that this does not make it into the international version of the release.'

In another email Pascal cites the proximity of North Korea to Japan as another reason changes might be necessary.

'I haven’t the foggiest notion how to deal with Japanese politics as it relates to Korea so all I can do is make sure that Sony won’t be put in a bad situation and even that is subjective,' she tells Rogen. 

Rogen agrees to make the changes, though Pascal does put in an email to Hirai that there was some 'resistance from the filmmakers.'

The changes, which have to do with a major plot point, seem to take some time to deal with, and Rogen completes the task to Hirai's liking it would seem by October, writing in his final email, 'Please tell us this is over now.'

And while he may have been annoyed and angered, Rogen is still very much a fan of Pascal, praising her Thursday evening at the premiere of the film.

'We want to thank Amy Pascal for having the balls to make this movie,' said Rogen. 

Ironically, however, the film is not set to open in Asia. 

The Daily Beast reports that a 'softer' version of the film - edited to take out gore - got approval from executives overseeing Mexico, Sweden, Russia, Belgium, Brazil, and France.

Executives from Australia and New Zealand, however, asked for the unedited versions - saying they wanted to 'sock it to 'em' - presumably referring to North Korea. Execs from the Netherlands and Spain wanted to gorier version, too. 

The changes are also described in the emails, though they spoil the film, which is set to open on December 25. 

This is just the latest email leak from a group calling themselves The Guardians of Peace, who, as previously mentioned, want to stop the release of The Interview.

Pascal said in an interview Thursday that every employee's email from the past 10 years was obtained in the hack, meaning these leaks could go on for weeks or even months.

It is believed that a group from North Korea is behind the hack. 

The scenes that were changed are detailed in the emails, and show what an amusing and out there film The Interview will be 

WARNING: Spoilers!

Sony executives ordered Rogen to tone down a scene in which Kim Jong-un is hit  with a tank shell, causing his head to explode.

In one email, Pascal writes to Harei: 'In shot #337 there is no face melting, less fire in the hair, fewer embers on the face, and the head explosion has been considerably obscured by the fire, as well as darkened to look less like flesh.'

She then adds, 'We arrived at this shot (#337) after much cajoling and resistance from the filmmakers.'

In another email, Doug Belgrad, president of Sony Pictures Entertainment motion picture group, wrote to Pascal; 'In the interest of getting this approved, I would still like to see them eliminate the tendril of flesh on the left side of his forehead that comes just before the fireball.'

Harei also requested that the scene where Jong-un's head explodes not be shown in any versions of the film outside the United States.
