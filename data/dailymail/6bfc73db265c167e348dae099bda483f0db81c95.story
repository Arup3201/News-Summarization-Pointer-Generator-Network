IT consultant-turned-travel blogger, Tom Ayzenberg, sure knows a thing or two when it comes to packing lightly.

In this viral video, which has been viewed over eight million times, the Birmingham, Michigan native, demonstrates a bundled wrapping method of packing - otherwise known as 'clown car style'.

'I'm going to pack all this stuff into this bag,' he says at the beginning of the video, displaying a month's worth of jeans, shorts, and t-shirts alongside a small backpack-like carry-on bag.

The 28-year-old explains that he had learned this particular packing hack from his mother.

Since the video first was uploaded, Ayzenberg has since gone on to become a successful travel blogger with his site, 'I'm Flying Around the Country.'

To replicate Tom's space-saving method, first lay all of your clothes out flat, with trouser legs and shirt arms hanging out of the bag.

Then, fold them on top of one another, tucking them in as you go.

Want even more space-saving inspiration? We talked to A Lady in London travel blogger, Julie Falconer, to get her in-the-know secrets:

1. Rolling clothes is key to saving space.

2. Opt for travel sizes of your favourite toiletries.

3. Only bring one pair of shoes.

4. Swap your larger noise-cancelling headphones for an in-ear style. 

While it may be a bit confusing at first, Ayzenberg's video does offer a pretty easy-to-understand step-by-step display of the process.

Never again will you have to decide between your two favourite pairs of jeans during a quick mini-break holiday. 

In fact, you'll even be able to fit in a full-size beach towel if you play your cards right. 

Best of all, by packing the clothes in so tightly, not only will you save loads of space, but there's also a far lesser chance that your clothes will arrive at your destination full of wrinkles.
