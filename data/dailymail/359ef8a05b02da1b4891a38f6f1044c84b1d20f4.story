A man shook his five-week-old son so violently after losing his temper that it caused a fatal brain bleed, a court heard today.

Simon Hathaway, 32, shook Jordan Hathaway
so severely that he stopped breathing and died within 90 minutes from 
internal injuries, jurors were told.

They heard that after the 
assault the baby’s mother, Anne Hathaway, waited almost 40 minutes 
before making an emergency 999 call to try to save their son.

Hathaway denies manslaughter and his wife, Anne, 21, denies willful neglect of the child.

Anne Hathaway, who was 19 at the time, was asleep upstairs in their one-bedroom home on February 22 2011 when the alleged assault is said to have happened, Reading Crown Court heard.

She was shown her son when Simon Hathaway brought him to her and he was floppy and not breathing.

Joanna Glynn QC, prosecuting, said that Anne Hathaway called her GP surgery at 8.47am and told the receptionist her son was not breathing. The receptionist advised her to call 999 immediately.

'She did not do that,' Miss Glynn said. 'The next clear point in time is 9.25am when we know that Anne Hathaway called 999.

'There was a delay of about 38 minutes between her calling the GP surgery and calling 999.

'The charge of neglect is her failure to seek medical help during the 38 minutes between the calls.'

Miss Glynn said that Jordan, who was described before his death as thriving, healthy and a quite normal baby, would have been very unwell immediately after he was allegedly shaken, causing bleeding called a subdural haematoma.

She told the jury that there was a 'golden hour' where aggressive intervention could have helped Jordan, but that the damage may have already been enough for him not to survive.

The barrister explained said that Jordan had other 'crucial injuries' including fractures to both his legs and one arm and injuries to the back of his eyes that she claimed were caused by Simon Hathaway when he shook him.

'The Crown say that Simon must have lost his temper with him (Jordan) and shook him in temper, only briefly, and that is what caused the injury to his brain,' Miss Glynn said.

Jordan Hathaway was shaken so severely that he stopped breathing and died within 90 minutes from internal injuries, jurors at Reading Crown Court were told

When Jordan was found by paramedics he was blue and had a weak pulse. He was rushed to hospital but died an hour and a half later.

Both parents were arrested.

Simon Hathaway denied any assault and said his son was fine but he had been crying that morning and had a big sneeze just before he became ill.

He said that after the call to the GP surgery he became responsive again, flinging his arms around, and they thought he was fine.

He said that Anne Hathaway went upstairs to get dressed as she was going to take him to the doctors but he collapsed again.

Anne Hathaway had, in effect, given the same account, Miss Glynn said.

But the barrister told the jury that the force used to inflict the injuries 'was beyond any normal or even rough handling' and that there was not medical evidence that a sneeze could cause such an injury.

The trial of the pair, both formerly of Colnbrook, Slough, but now living in Hayes, west London, is expected to last three weeks.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
