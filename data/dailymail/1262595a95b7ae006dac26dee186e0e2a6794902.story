A community reeling from the stabbing of two nine-year-old boys in an apparent murder-suicide has paid tribute to the twin brothers.

Sheila Cagney, the principal of the school attended by Thomas and Patrick O'Driscoll, described the boys as 'loving, energetic and full of fun'.

The brothers were found dead in their small, detached bungalow on the edge of Charleville, County Cork, Ireland, yesterday in what appears to be an appalling family tragedy.

The brothers were found dead in their small, detached bungalow on the edge of Charleville, County Cork, Ireland, yesterday in what appears to be an appalling family tragedy

The bodies of the twin boys were discovered in separate bedrooms by their younger brothers who are aged three and five. It is thought that they both suffered multiple stab wounds to the upper body

It is thought that the twins were stabbed to death by their 22-year-old brother Jonathan, who fled the scene and was found dead around an hour later about 10 miles from the home in a wooded area next to a river just outside Buttevant. It appears that he took his own life.

Thomas and Patrick were in third class in Banogue National School just over the county border in Croom, Limerick, and had been attending the school for just over a year.

As the whole community struggles to come to terms with the deaths, staff and pupils at the school are said to be deeply shocked and saddened by the twin boys' deaths.

Ms Cagney said: 'This is a terrible tragedy for the family, the school and the whole community. We are deeply saddened by this event.

'Our sympathy and thoughts are with the family and friends at this terrible time.'

In a statement, she added that the focus of the staff today and in the coming weeks was on the pupils in the school who are trying to come to terms with the loss of young friends.

'We will help the children to the best of our ability,' she said.

Experts from the national education psychological service of the Department of Education have been called in to the school to support staff in dealing with the tragedy.

Ms Cagney said the focus of the staff should be on the children and she appealed for privacy.

Candles burned on a low wall at the front of the property today as emotional scenes greeted the removal of Tom and Paddy's bodies in separate hearses from the house.

Father Naughton offered prayers at the roadside while relatives and friends of the family openly cried and comforted each other.

It is understood the O'Driscolls were settled members of the travelling community with adopted children and had been living in the Charleville area for many years.

Parents Thomas and Ellen O’Driscoll, who have six children, had been on a shopping trip - to the town of Kilmallock just six miles away -  when the tragedy happened.

Jonathan has been tasked with picking up his younger brothers and taking care of them while his parents were away from the house.

Local reports suggest police removed two knives from the river near to where Jonathan was found, which are now being examined to establish if they were used as the murder weapons.

Bishop of Cloyne William Crean extended his sympathy to the O'Driscoll family and urged people to pray for them.

'I speak for our faith community, and for all people of good will, when I say how shocked and greatly saddened I was to hear of the tragedy that has befallen the O'Driscoll family,' he said.

'Such loss of human life is extremely difficult to comprehend. I pray that the Lord will strengthen the family during this terrible time.

'I ask the priests and people of the diocese to pray for Thomas and Helen, for their surviving children, their extended family, and for the community of Charleville.'

Post-mortem examinations are to be carried out on the three family members at Cork University Hospital. 

Garda detectives are not seeking anyone in connection with his death. 

Sources close to the investigation said: ‘This is the most horrific crime we’ve ever had to deal with. It is hard to see what would spark something like this.’

There was speculation last night that Jonathan had recently learned that he was adopted, and that he killed his brothers in a fit of rage, but details about the tragedy are still emerging.

The family had been living in a pink and white bungalow in Deerpark, Charleville, County Cork

Health chiefs said specially trained counsellors were working in the town to support families and children affected by the tragedy.

'The Health Service Executive (HSE) wishes to extend its deepest sympathy to the family,' a spokesman said.

The HSE is working with suicide charity Console, the specialists from the Department of Education and other agencies to provide support, assistance and counselling, it said.

Community health workers with the Travellers of North Cork association were also in the town supporting members of the community, relatives and friends.

Counselling and support services are being set up in the area by the group alongside the HSE to help the immediate and extended family and they are expected to remain in place for several days into next week. 

If the murder-suicide suspicions are confirmed, it will be the second incident of its kind in Ireland in just over six weeks.

Two brothers died at their home in rural Sligo in late July. Nine-year-old Brandon Skeffington was found with stab wounds in the family home at Banada, Tourlestrane near Tubbercurry, before the body of his elder brother Shane junior, 21, was found in a shed beside the property.
