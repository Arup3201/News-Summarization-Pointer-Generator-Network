Before the 18 Bundesliga clubs can catch their breath over a six-week winter break, they have one final game which may determine how relaxing that break is going to be.

Disregarding the runaway league leaders Bayern Munich, the Bundesliga has split in half with all clubs either in the hunt for a place in Europe next season, or fighting to avoid relegation.

Seven sides are packed within five points below second-placed Wolfsburg while nine sides are grouped within the same number of points at the bottom of the table.

That group includes Borussia Dortmund, who head to bottom-placed Werder Bremen on Saturday aware that another defeat - their seventh on the road this season and 10th overall - could see them propping up the rest of the division leading into 2015.

Coach Jurgen Klopp hopes that will not be the case, but for the first time in his most difficult season at the club, he has hinted that he may have to consider stepping aside.

"The time will come in my life when I am no longer coach of this team, but what I know now that I will most definitely miss, and what is absolutely extraordinary, is the way the fans have supported us," Klopp said after his side were held to a 2-2 draw by Wolfsburg in midweek.

"It's just fantastic. There are plenty of stadiums in the world with great atmospheres, but not when you are 16th in the standings."

Klopp tried to clarify that statement on Thursday when he said it was not by any means preparation for his resignation.

He said he hopes that day will come later rather than sooner, "but not so late that I am no longer in a fit state to have any memory of the good times here.

"And I'm not saying that I am ill now either."

His club are certainly not in the best of shape, though, currently occupying their worst league position for this stage of a season in 30 years, and travelling to a Bremen side who have never been as low as they currently are after 16 games of the season.

Northern Germany rivals Hamburg are also in the thick of a relegation battle ahead of their trip to Schalke while Stuttgart could do with winning two games in a row for the first time this season when they host Paderborn.

On Sunday, the last of those strugglers - Freiburg - will bring the curtain down on the Bundesliga action for 2014 aware of that they need against Hannover to ensure a more relaxing festive period.

At the business end of the table, Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Monchengladbach are both vying for third place with goal difference currently the only thing separating them.

Leverkusen host Eintracht Frankfurt while Gladbach travel to Augsburg, who have made way for both Gladbach and Leverkusen by losing their last two games, while this weekend's other match is between Hertha Berlin and Hoffenheim on Sunday.
