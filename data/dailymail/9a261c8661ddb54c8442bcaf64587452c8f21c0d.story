Tragic: Landslide victim Susan Norman died in Looe, Cornwall last Friday having warned her council about the dangers two months ago

This is the grandmother who died when her home collapsed in floods, just months after she warned her council about the mortal danger her community faced should heavy rains strike.

Susan Norman’s ground floor flat was 
flattened last Friday as the three-storey building collapsed just before 6am after 
violent downpours hit Looe, Cornwall.

Tragically the mother-of-two was the only resident who did not escape.

Ms Norman had previously warned Cornwall County Council about the danger and
had contributed to a 65-page dossier put together by neighbours 
outlining their flood concerns.

On Friday more than a dozen local residents were forced to evacuate the street over fears more properties were at risk of damage. But
Ms Norman was the only one who could not be found.

Her children, Helen, Matthew and Rachael, had not heard from her since she went to bed at 7pm last Thursday after a long journey.

They had clung to the faint hope she 
was alive until authorities told them they had found Mrs 
Norman’s body in the rubble. Her daughter Rachael Boden said that the 
family was ‘extremely numb’. 

Neighbours said they heard 'windows 
popping' at the three-storey property under the pressure of a torrent of
surface water which had been washed down the road behind the building, 
split into three flats.

Retired police officer Pete Temlett, 59, who compiled the dossier 
with local residents, said it was handed to officials in February - two 
months before she died.

He said the dossier outlined problems dating back over ten years 
including blocked drains and poor curbing which were exposing the 
building to a serious risk.

The council had a ten day period to respond to the residents which 
they failed to meet eventually saying they would come back to them by 
today.

But before they responded Susan was killed and pulled from the home after a search by rescue teams and sniffer dogs.

Mr Temlett said: 'The police are now investigating the dossier and 
have advised us not to disclose anything from it. The council has failed
to act on information given to them.

'We put in all the evidence with photographs, letters, and e-mails received from the council.

'They refused to accept that we were vulnerable here and we even 
asked them if we could be engulfed by the road above and they said they 
had surveyed it and were quite happy with how things were.

'Mrs Norman did contribute to it, she told us about her concerns and 
safety with water at the back of her house and the water running over.

'She had made it very clear that she had concerns for her safety in 
her house as a result of the landslips that had already happened and we 
were very aware of that.'

Investigation: Emergency workers with the springer spaniel sniffer dog helping them with the search

The property, named 'Veronica', is 
one of a number of detached homes along the road, overlooking a sheer 
drop to the picturesque Looe Valley railway line.

Sandplace
Road, which runs along the entrance to the properties, has been closed 
to traffic for months after a landslide nearby just before Christmas.

The
road running along the back of the homes, a main road into the coastal 
town of Looe, was said to have been carrying excess surface water which 
locals said was caused by a combination of heavy rainfall and uncleared 
drains.

Location: The house that collapsed is in Looe, near to Plymouth in the eastern part of Cornwall

Devon and Cornwall Police say it has launched a joint investigation with the Health and Safety Executive.

A police spokesman said: 'Work is currently on-going to make the site
safe, in order to allow further specialist examinations to take place.'

Friend Edwina Hannaford described Ms 
Norman as 'a happy, lovely lady'. She said: 'Susan was well-known in the
town and was an active volunteer. She was a very happy lady, very 
friendly and smiley, and would always say hello.

'The
whole town has been on tenterhooks waiting for news, and sadly the news
that a body has been found is what we had been fearing.'

Cornwall County Council said: 'This is a very tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family and friends of Mrs Norman. The Council is continuing to work with the police and the Health and Safety Executive to carry out a thorough investigation into the cause of the landslip.

'We are providing information relating to the highways and drainage systems in the area to the police and Health and Safety Executive as part of the investigation.'
