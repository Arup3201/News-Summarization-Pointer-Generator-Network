Marion 'Suge' Knight is being questioned over the alleged murder of a friend today after turning himself into police in the early hours of this morning.

The hip hop mogul was named as a wanted man after he was  involved in a fatal hit-and-run incident in California that left one man dead and another injured.

Police believe Knight and some other men were involved in an argument on the set of the upcoming N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton on Thursday afternoon. 

When the men went to lunch at Tam's Burger's in Compton 20 minutes later, Knight, 49, is believed to have followed the men in his red pickup truck.

The incident ended with him reversing over one man and hitting another. Both were friends of Knight and police named the dead man as Terry Carter, 55. The injured man is actor Cle Shaheed 'Bone' Sloan, 51.

Mr Carter, a businessman, was a married father of two daughters. He lived with his wife Lillian, 55, near Inglewood, in Los Angeles.

Mrs Carter was said to be 'devastated'. A family spokesman said: 'We are just trying to get through the next few hours. This is a very emotional time for us all.' 

Knight's lawyer said his client 'accidentally' hit the men but the incident is being treated as a homicide by police.

Knight was declared to be wanted on suspicion of murder by police in Los Angeles on Thursday afternoon.

A bulletin issued to all police in California said he should be considered armed and dangerous, TMZ reported. 

Around 3am this morning he was  seen arriving at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department West Hollywood station with his attorney, James Blatt. 

Homicide detectives interviewed the Death Row Records founder for about three hours, the Los Angeles Times reported. 

Detectives formally 'arrested Marion 'Suge' Knight for murder'. Bail was set at $2million bail, according to a police statement.

Blatt admitted Knight was driving the truck but said he was 'confident that once the investigation is completed, he will be totally exonerated'.

'He was in the process of being physically assaulted by two men and in an effort to escape he unfortunately hit two (other) individuals.

'He was in his car trying to escape.' 

Blatt said the dead man was Knight's friend, 55-year-old Terry Carter. The second victim, actor Cle Shaheed 'Bone' Sloan, 51, was not seriously hurt, ABC 7 Los Angeles reported. 

Lt. John Corina of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department detective's unit said: 

'Looks like he drove backwards and struck the victims and drove forwards and struck them again.

'The people we talked to say it looked like it was an intentional act.

'They obviously knew each other.

'They got into some kind of verbal altercation and it escalated.' 

Robert Smith, 17, who witnessed the argument said. 'To see the argument happen, it's one thing.'

'Seeing the car incident, that was shocking.'

Knight's empty truck was found late Thursday night in a West Los Angeles parking lot. 

Authorities believe Knight was driving this truck yesterday. It was found  in a West Los Angeles parking lot

Knight, the dead man, and the injured actor were all friends.

Sloan and Knight had both been on the set of Straight Outta Compton before the argument.

The documentary is a bio-pic being made of the group N.W.A., which included Ice Cube -  the dead man's business partner - and Dr Dre. Neither were on set yesterday.

The injured man, Sloan, is a former gangster who has dedicated his life subsequently to filmmaking and anti-gang activities.

He was born in Los Angeles and is known for his work on Training Day, End of Watch and Brooklyn's Finest, according to his biography on IMDB.

The actor, who was featured in Eve's Gangsta Lovin' music video and served as a technical advisor for television shows Southland and Sons Of Anarchy, is a former member of the Los Angeles Bloods street gang.

He also directed an HBO documentary, Bastards of the Party, which examined the history of gangs in Los Angeles.

'I've put in a lot of work. I mean, unfortunately my hands got a lot of blood on them, you know, what I mean?' Sloan told National Public Radio. 

'And so people still look at me, you know, with that persona.

'So you see me on the block, you see me having some, you know, some success and it stimulates, you know, a dialogue between me and the homies - knowing that, you know, I'm a filmmaker and I am a Blood.'

The incident occurred in the parking lot of the fast-food joint yesterday (above) and Knight was charged with murder after turning himself in early on Friday morning 

This is  just the most recent in a string of legal problems and police run-ins for Knight.

He was shot six times in August at a Los Angeles nightclub at a party hosted by Chris Brown.

Two other people - a  man and a woman - were shot at the pre-MTV Video Music Awards party.

1987: Knight was arrested for domestic violence, allegedly stealing a car, carrying a concealed weapon and attempted murder.

1990: Knight pleaded guilty to two battery charges.

1991: Rumor has it Knight held Vanilla Ice over a balcony to get him to sign over his publishing rights - which he reportedly did. 

1992: Charged with assault and battery.

1996: Knight was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with rapper Tupac Shakur at a Las Vegas, Nevada, hotel. The beating came shortly before Shakur suffered fatal gunshot wounds.

1997: Linked to death of Notorious B.I.G.

2002: Knight was jailed for violating his probation by associating with gang members in Los Angeles.

2003: He went back to jail on a parole violation after punching a parking lot attendant outside a Hollywood nightclub.

2005: Knight was shot in the leg during an MTV Video Music Awards pre-party in Miami. No arrests were made.

2006: Death Row Records filed for bankruptcy, and a Los Angeles judge ordered a trustee to take it over because of gross mismanagement.

2015: Knight was arrested on suspicion of murder in a hit-and-run wreck that killed a man and injured another.

After he was shot, Knight reportedly calmly walked outside and asked a cop for help before he was rushed to hospital.

A source told the New York Post: 'It was organised chaos, Suge was shot right after talking to Chris Brown.

'Suge was talking to Brown who was on a podium. 

'They seemed to be having a friendly conversation that lasted a few minutes. About 30 seconds later shots rang out and Suge was hit.

'The shooter definitely wasn't aiming for Chris, because he was right there, stood above everyone, front and center.' 

No arrests were made in connection with the shooting.  

Following Knight's release from the hospital, he and comedian Katt Williams were arrested in October and charged with felony robbery for allegedly stealing a camera from a woman who was taking photos of the two.

The actual incident took place on September 5, just over a week after Knight had been shot.

He had been scheduled to appear in court this week after pleading not guilty in that case and being set free on $500,000 bail.  

In 1996 he was driving with his friend Tupac Shakur when the rapper was shot and killed in the passenger seat, a case that to this day remains unsolved.

In 1997 he was sentenced to nine years in prison after being convicted in an assault case, and was released in 2001. 

He was sent back two years later for violating his parole - after he hit a parking attendant. 

Some believe Knight was behind the 1997 killing of rap star Christopher Wallace, best known as Biggie Smalls or Notorious B.I.G.

In his book Murder Rap, former Los Angeles Police Department Detective Greg Kading wrote that Knight supplied money to an associate in exchange for killings Smalls.

Police have made no arrests in the case. 

Knight's name has also famously been linked to 90s rapper Vanilla Ice, aka Robert  Van Winkle.

According to hip hop lore, Knight held the Ice Ice Baby star over a balcony to convince him to sign over his publishing rights.

The legend also holds that Knight then used the money to start Death Row Records. The record company is now defunct. 

Lt. John Corina of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department detective's unit (above) said that Knight and and Carter and Sloan 'clearly knew each other'

Van Winkle partially denied the story during an interview with Interview Magazine: 

'That's a lie. 

'I read the story, and I heard it, and I had to defend it nine million times, but he never took me to the balcony, threatened to hang me over, or anything. 

'I did go to a balcony, so there is a little bit of truth to it. 

'Yes, Suge Knight took some money from me, and he did take me to the balcony, explained it to me. 

'He was actually nice to me.

'I look at it like I've invested in some of the greatest hip-hop music in the world. I mean, from the money that Suge got from To the Extreme [Vanilla Ice album] from me, he started Dr. Dre.

'The Chronic record came from the funding from my record; Tupac came from the funding of my record; Snoop Dogg came from the funding from my record.'
