Dr Rowan Williams yesterday made his most powerful intervention yet in the assisted suicide argument

A new law to legalise assisted dying would be a ‘disaster’, the Archbishop of Canterbury declared yesterday.

Dr Rowan Williams said that condoning assisted suicide would undermine the sanctity of life - and he compared its effects to the legalisation of abortion a generation ago.

The Archbishop told the Church of England’s parliament, the General Synod: ‘The default position on abortion has shifted quite clearly over the past 40 years.

‘To see the default position shifting on the sanctity of life would be a disaster.’

His warning came as the Synod voted overwhelmingly to condemn the ‘Independent Commission on Assisted Dying’ led by former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, which called last month for laws to allow doctors to help the terminally ill to kill themselves.

Its members said Lord Falconer’s panel was not independent and had endangered the vulnerable and the disabled.

Yesterday Dr Williams made his most powerful intervention into the argument over assisted suicide, which has assumed growing political importance over the past nine years.

In that time around 150 Britons have travelled to die at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. No relative or friend has been prosecuted for helping, despite the fact that assisting with a suicide is a crime that can attract a 14-year prison sentence.

Dr Williams said: ‘Law exists so that people may be protected, especially the vulnerable. Law exists to provide equality of protection for all. What we are faced with in these proposals from the Commission is a legal outcome in which protection is diminished not only for vulnerable individuals but also for medical professionals.’

The Archbishop drew a connection between abortion and assisted dying which suggests he thinks that any assisted dying law would lead to very large numbers of deaths. Abortion was legalised in 1967 with safeguards to assure doubters that it would only be permitted in a small number of cases where a pregnant woman was at risk.

However, there are now 200,000 abortions every year and abortion ends more than one in five of all pregnancies in England.

Dr Williams said of the proposals from Lord Falconer’s Commission:  ‘To change the law on this subject is to change something vital in our sense of the value of life itself.’

He added: ‘We are not committed to the notion - the eccentric notion - that Christians believe we should cling to life at all costs.

‘We are committed as Christians to the belief that every life in every imaginable situation is infinitely precious in the sight of God. To say that there are certain conditions in which life is legally declared to be not worth living is a major shift in the moral and spiritual atmosphere in which we live. We can be realistic, we can be compassionate, in the application of the existing law.’

The Archbishop said that palliative care for the dying was now at a level in this country where it was the envy of Europe. ‘Anything which changes this level of care is to be resisted with all our power,’ he said.

‘Anything which has the effect of minimising our protection of the most vulnerable is not something to which I believe we could ever assent.’

The law against assisted suicide has been effectively eroded by prosecution guidelines published by Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer in 2009. These broadly said that no family member is likely to be charged with assisted suicide if they have helped a love one to die out of compassion rather than greed.

Lord Falconer’s Commission proposed a system under which someone given 12 months or less to live would be able to ask a doctor to provide them with poison and help them take it. A series of safeguards to prevent abuse would include checks on the family and on the soundness of mind of the person asking to die.

But the Synod was told the Commission’s members were almost all known to be in favour of assisted dying and many influential individuals and charities had declined to help it by giving evidence.

Synod member Sarah Finch said: ‘The Commission’s proposals are essentially no different from those presented a few years ago to the House of Lords, where they were rejected on the basis of concerns about public safety.’
