Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will be counting down the days until he can call upon the services of star striker Daniel Sturridge once again.

With Sturridge sidelined and his former strike partner Luis Suarez now in Barcelona, the Reds are crying out for a potent finisher. 

Incredibly Rodgers' side have had a staggering 44 shots at goal in their last three Premier League outings against Arsenal, Manchester United and Sunderland. But they have managed to score only two goals in that period.

In fact, only 21 of those 44 shots were on target which is a frightening statistic considering  Rodgers signed two international strikers in Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert in a bid to fill the  void left by Suarez's departure.

Liverpool ran riot against Arsenal at Anfield last season with Martin Skrtel and Sterling both scoring twice while Sturridge was also on target in an emphatic 5-1 thrashing.

But the Reds are no longer striking fear into the opposition and only claimed a point against a lacklustre Arsenal on Sunday thanks to a 97th-minute equaliser by Skrtel.

Indeed they were just minutes away from losing their eighth league game of the campaign. In contrast they lost just six league games during the entirety of last season.
