A record 3,100 people every day are finding work as Britain’s jobless total falls at the fastest rate in 17 years.

The number of unemployed tumbled to 2.32million – falling by 167,000 between September and November, the biggest drop since 1997.

Yesterday the Office for National Statistics said the unemployment rate is now at 7.1 per cent after falling faster than any economist or the Bank predicted.

But the Bank of England insisted interest rates are not on the brink of their first rise in nearly seven years despite governor Mark Carney saying it would consider raising rates if the jobless rate fell to 7 per cent.

In an unusually political statement, the Bank also said the Coalition’s benefits clampdown may have pushed more people into looking for work, rather than continuing to rely on State handouts. It said: ‘A tightening in the eligibility requirements for some State benefits might also have led to an intensification of job search.’ 

The number of people claiming the dole plunged by more than 300,000 people over the last year, the biggest annual drop in Jobseeker’s Allowance claimants since 1998.

There are now just 1.25million people on JSA, the lowest figure since January 2009 – and there are enough job vacancies for half of them to find work.

Overall, the ONS said an extra 
280,000 people started working between September and November, raising 
the workforce to an all-time high of 30.2million.

Of
 all the jobs created, eight in ten were full-time positions, reversing a
 long-term trend of workers forced to accept part-time jobs.

With inflation at its target of 2 per cent, the Bank said it sees ‘no immediate need to raise bank rates even if the 7 per cent unemployment threshold were to be reached in the near future’.

Esther McVey said young people should be prepared to work in places such as coffee shops rather than expecting their dream job immediately

The base rate was cut to 0.5 per cent in March 2009 and has remained at this level – the lowest in the Bank’s 320-year history – ever since. For the first time, the Bank also said any increase in the base rate will be slow and steady, rather than a rapid rise back to more normal levels.

At a speech in Nottingham yesterday, Ian McCafferty, a member of the Bank’s committee, said the 7 per cent figure has always been ‘only a threshold, not a trigger.’

John Cridland, director general of business lobby group the CBI, said: ‘Now is not the time to raise interest rates.’ Yesterday David Cameron hailed the employment figures as evidence the Government’s austerity drive is working, but added there should ‘not be one ounce of complacency’.

He said: ‘We are securing Britain’s future and it would be put at risk by Labour’.

The Prime Minister called on Labour leader Ed Miliband to apologise for ‘the mess you left us’  Mr Cameron said: ‘You are like an arsonist who goes around setting fire after fire and then complains when the fire brigade aren’t putting out the fires fast enough.’

The figures cast fresh doubt on Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls’s view in October 2011 that it is ‘a complete fantasy’ the private sector could mop up the public sector jobs cull.

Since May 2010, the private sector has grown to a record 24.4million, equal to more than 80 per cent of the country’s workforce.
