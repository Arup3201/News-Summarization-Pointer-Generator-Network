Mother's Day is a chance to show the most important woman in your life just how much you care.

It’s also a golden opportunity for companies to cash in with some truly wacky present ideas.

If you’d like to surprise mum with something a little different this Sunday, here’s our alternative Mother’s Day gift guide...

Is she still pacing the floors worried about what 
you’re getting up to? Then she may as well get them clean at the same 
time, with these multitasking slippers.

Just £3.99 from findmeagift.co.uk

Let all the neighbours know that a living 
legend resides in their street. Snap up a bespoke heritage plaque to say
 thanks to your mum. Apart from the wording, it looks just like the real
 thing.

From £109.99 at firebox.com

Say it with a cup of coffee. Just pop one of these 
hand-made acrylic stencils (which comes in pink, turquoise, lilac, 
purple and fuschia) over foamed milk, dust it with cocoa powder and ta 
da, love in a mug.

£12.50, notonthehighstreet.com

Whose mother would want tastefully engraved 
jewellery when she can have a bespoke wooden spoon with her name and 
‘face’ engraved into it?

£5.50 from notonthehighstreet.com

Glamorous gloves

Show her you care with a pair of pink latex 
washing-up gloves, complete with lacy trim and ‘special mum’ in curly 
writing. Just don’t expect any inheritance.

£3.49, eBay.com

A heart-shaped cheeseboard personally dedicated to 
the best woman in the world should cut it for those who don’t like 
traditionally sentimental presents.

£29.99 from gettingpersonal.co.uk

Okayest mum mug

One for mums with a good sense of humour and who don’t mind being being complimented on how average they are. 

£9.95 from zazzle.co.uk

She slaved over a hot oven throughout your childhood. 
Return the favour with a Mother’s Day cake that comes in a tin. Just add
 water, pop in the oven and watch your mum’s face as she ‘marvels’ at 
your baking prowess.

£3.99 from thefoodministry.com
