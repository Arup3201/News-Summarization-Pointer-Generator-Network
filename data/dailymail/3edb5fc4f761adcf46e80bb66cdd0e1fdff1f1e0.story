Five horses found bony, diseased and malnourished have been rescued from a Delaware farm three months after authorities say their owner was warned to take better care of them.

Found 153 to 333 pounds underweight suffering now long-term dental and other health problems, the horses' discovery came after SPCA officers in Camden received an anonymous call last week reporting their dangerous conditions.

The four mares and single gelding between four and 14 years of age were removed from the farm last Wednesday.

Rescued: Five horses seen boney, diseased and malnourished were removed from a property in Camden where officials say the animals had been abused

Owner's care: Animal officials say the owner of the horses were ordered to see a veterinarian and take better are of them in July but a meal plan prescribed to them was not followed

Their owner, who has not been identified, faces numerous charges of animal cruelty.

It was only last July according to the Kent County SPCA that the owner was ordered to provide nutritional and dental care for the horses.

The owner complied with that order to seek veterinary care and received a specific nutrition plan to put the horses on a path of recovery, SPCA Major Brian Whipple told Delaware Online.

They failed to follow the plan, however, with officials now finding the horses each 153, 203, 308, 315, and 333 pounds underweight.

Diseased: In addition to being found malnourished, the horses also suffered rain rot, a skin disease that causes their coats to develop scabs and lesions

Starved: The horses were each found 153, 203, 308, 315, and 333 pounds underweight, their hip bones and rib cages easily visible

Moving forward: Once the animals' health is improved they will be up for adoption while their owner faces numerous animal cruelty charges

Seen with spotted coats, they also had developed rain rot, a skin disease that causes a matted coat and bumps that can escalate to scabs and lesions.

When more healthy their dental problems will also require anesthesia, said Major Whipple.

Once that is complete they will be available for adoption.
