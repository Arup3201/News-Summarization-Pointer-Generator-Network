An Arizona woman was charged with felony child abuse after police say she forced her boyfriend’s 3-year-old daughter to eat her own feces as a disciplinary measure.

Nicole Renee Candelaria, 27, had her initial court appearance Monday and her bond was set at $5,400.

Ms Candelaria was arrested Saturday in Tempe. Authorities say she is the primary caregiver for her boyfriend’s three girls, ages 3 and 5, while he is at work.

Stomach-turning:  Nicole Candelaria, 27, is accused of forcing her boyfriend's 3-year-old daughter to eat her own excrement as punishment for defecating in the bathtub

Cruel punishment: Candelaria, pictured here with two of her boyfriend's three daughters, allegedly held the girl down on the toilet seat and put soap in her mouth

Court records show Candelaria became upset Friday when the 3-year-old child in her care defecated in the bathtub and the 27-year-old woman allegedly forced her to eat the excrement as punishment for the mishap.

The victim also accused her caretaker of forcibly holding her down on the toilet seat and putting soap in her mouth.

The alleged incident took place while the three sisters were staying with their father in Tempe for a week, ABC15 reported. When the girls returned home Friday night, the 3-year-old complained to her mother about Candelaria.

Baby sitter: Candelaria often looked after the 3-year-old twins and their 5-year-old sister (right) when the girls' father was at work

Her version: The 27-year-old told police the alleged 3-year-old victim lied often and denied forcing her to eat feces or holding her down by force

The child's story was corroborated by her 3-year-old twin and their 5-year-old sister.

The 3-year-old girl was taken to a hospital for a check-up where a forensic medical exam revealed that she had bruises on her back, chest and legs consistent with forcible holding. 

Doctors also found that the toddler suffered an injury to her vagina, the cause of which remained unknown.

Truth comes out: The 3-year-old's twin sister and older sibling both corroborated her tale of abuse, and a medical exam determined that the child suffered bruises all over her body

When questioned by police about the abuse claims, Candelaria, whose Facebook profile states she works at 'Mommyhood Inc,' replied that the 3-year-old victim 'lies often' and denied the feces-eating incident altogether.

Ms Candelaria has since been released from jail on bond. She is due back in court May 23.
