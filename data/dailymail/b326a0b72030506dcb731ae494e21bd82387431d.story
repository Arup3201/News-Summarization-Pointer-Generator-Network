West Ham have been given a boost with news that Andy Carroll has returned to first-team training following injury.

The 25-year-old hasn't kicked a ball all campaign after picking up an ankle problem in the Hammers' pre-season tour of New Zealand, but his arrival on Thursday was confirmed via the club's official Twitter account.

Carroll is pictured grinning from ear-to-ear as he is put through his paces along with the rest of the West Ham squad.

Andy Carroll returned to first-team training with West Ham on Thursday after an ankle injury

The England international won't feature in the club's home clash against Manchester City on Saturday with his comeback likely to be in November.

Carroll's eventual return will come as a welcome addition to boss Sam Allardyce despite the club's impressive early-season form.

The Upton Park outfit sit fourth in the Premier League having collected 13 points from eight games to date.

Summer signings Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia have adapted to life in England brilliantly so far with the pair having scored seven goals between them in England's top flight.

Injury-plagued Carroll will find it hard to displace the duo upfront on current form, but the £15million striker's return will give Allardyce a welcome selection dilemma when fully-fit.
