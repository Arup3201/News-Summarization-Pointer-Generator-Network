After spending his third Thanksgiving in five years in jail, a judge will today decide whether the world's most arrested man will remain incarcerated for the holidays.

Henry Earl, 64, from Lexington, Kentucky, has been arrested more than 1,500 times in his career of criminality, which began in the 1970s at the tender age of 20.

However, his epic law-unabiding - mostly public drunkeness - has made the homeless man nicknamed 'James Brown' something of a legend in his city of 300,000, and many of the locals are hoping for a 'Christmas miracle.'

Christmas in the clink: After spending his third Thanksgiving in five years in jail, a judge will decide Thursday whether the world's most arrested man, Henry Earl, pictured left and right, will remain incarcerated for the holidays

Arrests: Earl, 64, from Lexington, Kentucky, has been arrested more than 1,500 times in his career of criminality, which began in the 1970s at the tender age of 20

Earl, who also spent his 64th birthday behind bars in October, is scheduled to appear in a Fayette County court for a probation revocation hearing today after being arrested for alcohol intoxication last week.

'He is somewhat of a superstar in his own little world,' Fayette County Detention Center Officer John Casey told ABCNews.com.

Earl's arrest history goes as far back as July 1970 when he was in his twenties for carrying a concealed weapon, according to The Smoking Gun, which has followed his career. He would go on to be arrested 33 more times that decade.

Since then, Earl has been gradually increasing his frequency of arrests.

In the 1980s, Earl picked up the pace
with 230 arrests, most due to public drunkenness or disorderly conduct.
But it wasn't until 2008, that Earl gained national attention when he 
found himself in court for his 1000th arrest for public intoxication.

Judge Gary Payne made it an occasion by sentencing Earl to 1000 days in jail 'for your anniversary'.

While
Judge Payne was under the impression that it was Earl's 1,000th arrest,
The Smoking Gun later discovered that it was actually number 1,333. The
website tallied that he has spent some 6,000 days in jail for his 
arrests.

'It's a weekly, if not every-two-or-three-days thing,' Lexington police spokeswoman Sherelle Roberts told CNN. 'He's never doing bad or illegal things purposely... He's just so highly intoxicated that he's posing a danger to himself.'

There have even been times when Earl was released from the Fayette County Jail - which The Smoking Gun believes should be renamed in the man's honor - in the evening, only to return by midnight.

Earl's sentences were shorter enabling him to rack up dozens of arrests in a year, jail spokeswoman Jennifer Taylor told CNN.

However,
these days judges have begun handing down harsher sentences, some of 
which have lasted up to three months. As such, he's only been arrested 
five times this year.

'Most people on the streets of Lexington know who he is,' Taylor said.

One person who is praying for his release, and him to turn around his wayward antics, is Ginny Ramsey, co-founder of Lexington's Catholic Action Center, who calls the 'very pleasant' Earl her friend.

'You can't help but love him, I tell you. ... He's as honest as the day is long,' she told CNN. 'With Henry Earl, you're going to hear the truth.'

She said, when he's not in the clink, the man, who local band the Dangles, even wrote a song about, occasionally drops by the center for a bed or a bite to eat. But she said he was 'pretty independent.'

She said the center's staff were 'within an inch' of getting Earl to kick his booze habit last year, but Earl told her, with a trademark smile on his face, 'I'm not ready,' she said.

She's hoping this year will be different.

'I don't think it's going to take many more winters, and this one may be the one,' Ramsey told the network. 'There's never going to be a time when I'm not going to find something, even if it's one of our couches, for Henry Earl.'
