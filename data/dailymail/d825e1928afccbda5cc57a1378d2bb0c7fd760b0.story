A coffee connoisseur from Florida has smashed the world drinks records for the biggest and most expensive Starbucks drink by ordering himself a 101-shot latte which cost an impressive $83.75.

Political consultant and talk show host William Lewis told the Today Show that the feat had started as an online challenge and added that he was more than happy to accept because he feels that Starbucks' 31oz maximum drinks policy is a direct contradiction to their promise to fulfill any customer's customization request. 

It is not the first time that Mr Lewis has gained notoriety through a Starbucks stunt. The would-be comedian regularly updates his Facebook fans about his morning coffee order - usually a six-shot Venti, four-pump vanilla, one-pump mocha, extra-hot, extra fat, upside down latte. 

Caffeine overload: William Lewis smashed world drinks records by ordering the 101-shot latte

That's once pricey cup of coffee! The mega beverage set Mr Lewis back $83.75. Thankfully he had enough reward points stored up on his Starbucks card to cover the cost

However Mr Lewis' close friend Rico Petrocelli insists that this latest challenge is his best yet.

'This is the apex of his Starbucks career,' Mr Petrocelli told the Today Show. 'It's like pulling up to McDonald's drive-thru and saying, "give me 600 hamburgers".

And it's not just Starbucks which keeps Mr Lewis' Facebook fans entertained. The Florida native is also a keen coupon collector, a hobby which helped him to cover the cost of the 'mega' latte as it is now known. 

Thanks to his continued custom at Starbucks, Mr Lewis was able to pay for his beverage using the remaining reward points on his Starbucks MyRewards loyalty card, which grants a free drink of the customer's choice after every 12 coffee orders. 

'I advised him not to drink it': Mr Lewis' barista admitted that she didn't think it was wise for him to drink the entire latte 

Above average: Starbucks usually insist that no hot beverage can be served larger than a 20 ounce Venti size

Despite Mr Lewis' enthusiasm about completing the challenge, not everyone shared his optimism - with Starbucks barista Danielle Strachan admitting that she advised him not to drink it, even though she thought her words of wisdom might land her in trouble with her employer.  

Starbucks spokesperson Linda Mills told the Today Show that the company's policy is that its hot beverages can't be served larger than a 20oz Venti size.

She insisted that Mr Lewis' beverage was 'naturally against our policy' and advised that he exercise caution with regard to such excessive caffeine consumption. 

It seems their advice may have had impact however; after posing for photographs, Mr Lewis invited two of his close friends to share the 'mega' latte with each third portion coming in at around 32oz per man - just a fraction more than Starbucks' 31oz Trenta cup.
