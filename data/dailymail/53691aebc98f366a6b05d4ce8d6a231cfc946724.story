Osama bin Laden wanted to give Al Qaeda a new name with more of a religious element

Osama Bin Laden was missing his old friends and believed that Al Qaeda had an image problem which could mean it would have to change its name, an extraordinary letter written by the terror mastermind reveals.

In a fascinating and unprecedented insight into the thinking of the 54-year-old Al Qaeda chief in the months before his death, he laments that the organisation was suffering from a marketing problem and that his group had killed too many Muslims – this was bad for business, Bin Laden confesses.

The undated letter was discovered among the 'treasure trove' of documents and data found in his hideaway in the Pakistan garrison city of Abbottabad when U.S. Navy Seals raided the fortress-like compound, killing him and two Al Qaeda couriers.

Details emerged in Washington as U.S. investigators completed the initial review of documents seized from the compound although intelligence analysis will continue for months.

Its contents were described by senior Obama administration and national security officials on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the material.

The image it portrays of Bin Laden is one that his supporters and many in the Islamic world are likely to question – a terrorist chief struggling to sell the holy war for an organisation in crisis.

The letter suggests Bin Laden believed the West was winning the public relations fight and remarkably needed a fresh beginning under a new name.

The problem with the name Al Qaeda, Bin Laden wrote was that it lacked a religious element, something to convince Muslims worldwide that they are in a holy war with America.

As Bin Laden saw it, the problem was that the group's full name, Al Qaeda al-Jihad, for The Base of Holy War, had become short-handed as simply Al Qaeda. Cutting out the word 'jihad,' he wrote, allowed the West to 'claim deceptively that they are not at war with Islam.' Maybe it was time for Al Qaeda to bring back its original name, he mused.

Perhaps something like Taifat al-Tawhed Wal-Jihad, meaning Monotheism and Jihad Group, would do the trick, he wrote. Or Jama'at I'Adat al-Khilafat al-Rashida, meaning Restoration of the Caliphate Group.

Bin Laden wrote his thoughts about renaming Al Qaeda as a letter but, as with many of his writings, the recipient was not identified.

U.S. intelligence officials say with the need for absolute secrecy, Bin Laden only communicated with his most senior commanders, including his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, and his No. 3, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid.

Because of the courier system Bin Laden used, it's unclear to U.S. intelligence whether the letter ever was sent. His two most trusted couriers – the men who are unwittingly said to have led the CIA to Bin Laden’s hideout where he lived with his wives and children - were shot dead by the US Abbottabad raiding party. One of Bin Laden’s sons also died.

Al-Yazid was killed in a U.S. airstrike last year but Egyptian-born Zawahri has replaced Bin Laden as head of Al Qaeda and is believed to be planning a spectacular revenge attack at a time when the uprisings across the Arab world have helped to undermine the terror network.

In one letter sent to Zawahri within the past year or so, Bin Laden said Al Qaeda’s image was suffering because of attacks that have killed Muslims, particularly in Iraq, officials said.

In other journal entries and letters, officials said, Bin Laden wrote that he was frustrated that many of his trusted longtime friends and comrades, who he'd fought alongside in Afghanistan, had now been killed or captured.

Using his courier system, Bin Laden could still exercise some operational control over Al-Qaida, the letter shows, but increasingly the men he was directing were younger and inexperienced.

Frequently, the generals who had vouched for and directed these young fighters were dead or in prison.

Unable to leave his walled compound some 30 miles from the Pakistan capital Islamabad, Bin Laden was annoyed that he did not know so many people in his own organisation.

At the White House, the documents were taken as positive reinforcement for President Barack Obama's effort to eliminate religiously charged words from the government's language of terrorism.

Words like 'jihad,' which also has a peaceful religious meaning, are out.

'Islamic radical' has been replaced by descriptions such as 'terrorist' and 'mass murderer.' Although former members of President George W. Bush's administration have backed that effort, it also has drawn ridicule from critics who said the president was being too politically correct.

'The information that we recovered from Bin Laden's compound shows Al Qaeda under enormous strain,' Obama said on Wednesday in his speech to the nation on withdrawing troops from Afghanistan.

'Bin Laden expressed concern that Al Qaeda had been unable to effectively replace senior terrorists that had been killed and that Al Qaeda has failed in its effort to portray America as a nation at war with Islam, thereby draining more widespread support.'

A mobile phone also recovered from the raid contained numbers of militant group tied with Pakistan's intelligence agency.

The discovery indicates that Bin Laden used the group, Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen, as part of his support network within the country.

U.S. officials say it also raises questions over whether the Al Qaeda chief was being sheltered by elements within the spy agency.

Analysts tracing calls made on the phone have found that Harakat commanders called Pakistani intelligence officials and that the agency had mentored the group and allowed it to operate within the country for 20 years.

It is not known if the calls were to discuss Bin Laden and there is no proof that Pakistan's intelligence agency protected the terror chief.
