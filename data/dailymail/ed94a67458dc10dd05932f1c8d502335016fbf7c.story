A 16-year-old girl was arrested on suspicion of trying to smuggle $100,000 worth of marijuana into the US from Mexico

The teenager was detained with two women, aged 23 and 24, after officers allegedly found 185 pound haul in their Volkswagen sedan.

A narcotics detection dog patrolling the boarder crossing in the Port of Lukesville, Arizona, picked out the vehicle for a secondary search, according to azcentral.com. 

A 16-year-old girl has been arrested trying to smuggle 12 bags of marijuana into the US from Mexico

Officers from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers examined the car and discovered 12 packages of marijuana.

The find was said to be worth an estimated $92,550, according to a spokesman for the CBP.

The teenager from Glendale, Arizona, who was reportedly driving the car, and the two women were not named by officials.

Both the drugs and the dark coloured sedan were seized as part of the investigation.

The trio have now been referred to immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations. 

Cannabis was legalized in the state of Arizona for medical use in 2010 following a ballot.

A growing number of states, including Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and Alaska, have voted to allow people to possess limited amounts of marijuana.

Supporters of the legalization campaign in Arizona hope to have a vote on the issue next year.
