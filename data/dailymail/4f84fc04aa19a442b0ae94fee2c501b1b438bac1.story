Any boyfriend intending to propose to his better half would be thrilled if he could preserve the moment forever with a secretly taken photograph - as long as she says 'yes' of course.

But one loved-up man went to extreme lengths to ensure he would have a permanent record of that life-changing moment - by hiding a photographer in a nearby bin.

Adam Puckrin popped the question to his girlfriend Bailey Carson at the Peterborough Zoo in Ontario, Canada, on Saturday morning.

He wanted to capture the moment but, to maintain the surprise, he had to hide his snapper.

Pop the question: Adam Puckrin gets down on one knee to girlfriend Bailey Carson

Spot the snapper: Unbeknown to her, photographer Chance Faulkner was hiding in a bin nearby

Tight fit: Mr Faulkner insisted his hiding place wasn't too much of a squeeze 'as I'm a relatively small guy'

With no obvious places to hide, photographer Chance Faulkner ingeniously decided to hide in a green bin.

Mr Faulkner said: 'There weren't too many places to hide so I jumped in the bin.

'I'm a relatively small guy so it wasn't too bad a fit.

'Adam got Bailey to walk down towards the lake, where I was already hiding ready to take photos.

Busted: After saying 'yes' Miss Carson spotted the friendly voyeur who was positioned just yards away

Snapped back: She took her own picture of him hiding in the bin to remember the day by

Diamond idea: Miss Carson shows off her engagement ring after the unusual proposal

'A few romantic words later, Adam proposed, and Bailey said yes!

'All of a sudden she spotted me and couldn't stop laughing.'

Mr Faulkner is a wedding and engagement photographer and arranged with Mr Puckrin to plan a fake date at the zoo.

Once the happy couple got to the side of the lake, Mr Puckrin lowered down on to one knee and popped the question.

As the couple celebrated, Miss Carson spotted Mr Faulkner cowering in the bin with his woolly hat on to ward off the cold.

Fortunately, she found it funny and started taking her own pictures to capture the happy moment. 

Downside: Mr Faulkner wasn't lucky enough to find an empty bin, and snapped the rubbish inside his hideout
