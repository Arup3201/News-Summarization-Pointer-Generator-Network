Under pressure: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg only blocked key Tory policies to bolster his own support against a Vince Cable coup, claims Michael Gove

Nick Clegg’s leadership of the Liberal Democrats was in turmoil yesterday as Michael Gove claimed he was blocking key Tory policies purely to head off a plot to have him replaced by Vince Cable.

The Education Secretary suggested that the Deputy Prime Minister’s threat to veto childcare reforms last week was an attempt to ‘show a bit of leg’ from a leader desperate to cheer up his own party rather than a principled objection.

Lib Dem sources dismissed Mr Gove’s claims as ‘loopy’, but he insisted the party’s former Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott was behind attempts to have Mr Clegg ousted in favour of Business Secretary Mr Cable, his friend and ally.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond upped the pressure by agreeing it was clear that Mr Cable, who suggested yesterday he was not too old for high office despite turning 70 last week, was an ‘ambitious and distinctive’ figure.

Some Tories are privately in favour of Mr Clegg being removed before the next election and replaced with Mr Cable.

They say only a break with the past under a new leader is likely to help the Lib Dems recover sufficiently to head off the threat from Labour in their northern seats and help prevent it from winning other Tory/Labour marginals.

Mr Clegg has objected to a number of Tory policies in recent months, including Mr Gove’s attempts to scrap GCSEs and bring back the O-level and an extension of secret courts.

Last week, the Deputy Prime Minister said he was also against plans to allow some nurseries to relax the ratio of adults to children in an attempt to bring down costs for working couples.

In remarks that will open up new divisions in the Coalition, Mr Gove said yesterday it was clear Mr Clegg was trying to derail another previously agreed government proposal because of party politics.

Vowing the reforms drawn up by his childcare minister, Elizabeth Truss, would go ahead with minor ‘tweaks’, Mr Gove said: ‘I don’t think we can understand Nick Clegg’s position without also appreciating the position that he’s in because of internal Lib Dem politics.

‘There’s a campaign being run at the moment being led by Matthew Oakeshott, this Liberal Democrat in the Lords, to try to destabilise Nick Clegg because Matthew Oakeshott wants Vince Cable to succeed him. And Nick understandably needs to show Lib Dems he’s fighting hard.’

Mr Gove said Mr Clegg was a ‘reasonable guy’ and he believed he would agree to a compromise on childcare. ‘Lord Oakeshott is on manoeuvres, he’s trying to promote Vince,’ he added.

‘It’s understandable that within the Lib Dems these things go on. Nick has to show a bit of leg, as it were, on these issues.

‘But we’ve seen these situations arise in the past and we’ve managed to resolve them in the national interest.’

Front line: Vince Cable, who turned 70 last week, says he has no intention of stepping away from politics. Friends describe him as 'ambitious'

From September, the ratio for under-ones had been due to rise from three per adult to four in pre-schools that want to take part. Each adult would be able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four.

A government analysis suggests relaxing the rules would reduce costs by 12 per cent, saving the average parent £1,329 a year per child in full-time care.

David Cameron is under growing pressure to overrule Mr Clegg and implement the reforms, which do not need legislation, despite his objections.

Mr Gove’s intervention, an unprecedented attack on Mr Clegg by a Tory minister, caused deep anger in Lib Dem ranks.

A senior Lib Dem source said: ‘We appreciate that Michael Gove has ambitions of his own and is keen to distract attention from his party’s divisions on Europe.

‘But he knows our concerns are based on the overwhelmingly negative response from experts and parents to the Government’s consultation.’

Lord Oakeshott said it was ‘old news’ that he preferred Mr Cable to Mr Clegg, ‘but there’s no plot – members decide who leads us’.

A source close to the Business Secretary said: ‘It seems clear the only person with leadership ambitions is Michael Gove.’
