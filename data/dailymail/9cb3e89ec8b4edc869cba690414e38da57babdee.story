Rangers full-back Lee Wallace has admitted he has all but given up hope of playing for Scotland.

The 27-year-old defender, who last played for his country in a 0-0 draw with the United States last November, is set to miss the trip to face World Champions Germany in next month's 2016 Euro qualifier when Scotland boss Gordon Strachan names his squad on Monday morning.

Conceding he sacrificed his international ambitions to stay with Rangers and help them back up the leagues, Wallace revealed he has also received a phonecall from Strachan explaining his situation.

Realistic: Lee Wallace knows his chances of playing for his country again are very slim

Focus: Lee Wallace has no regrets over sacrificing his international career to concentrate on his club career

And asked if he expects to feature against the Germans, he admitted: 'Probably not, no. I'm still probably a bit behind. There are guys who have been in it who are way ahead of me at this stage — guys who play their football down south in strong successful sides.

'I'll never hold much hope for it but I'm not going to get too downbeat about it, either, as I'm just going to concentrate on Rangers and always will do.

'When I stayed with Rangers after what happened, I knew that [playing in the lower leagues] would be a stumbling block [for international call-ups] and Craig Levein had said at the time it would be difficult to select someone in the bottom tier of Scottish football.

'I accepted that and understood it at that level.

'I was aware of that and it was a sacrifice I made. Rangers is the one for me and I want to play a part in their history over the next few years.'

The emergence of Andrew Robertson at Dundee United led to the young left-back making a £2.5million move to Hull City this summer.

And the 20-year-old, who has made an impressive start in the Barclays Premier League, now looks to be Strachan's first pick, with Wallace adding: 'I kind of got the message in some of the last few squads - although the manager did phone me one time to say he wanted to look at other people and they've gone on to bigger and better things, playing their football in one of the best leagues in the world.
