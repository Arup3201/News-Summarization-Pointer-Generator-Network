Prime Minister: Schools, hospitals and other public service organisations will be told to cut down on imported food and buy British instead under new guidelines unveiled by David Cameron today

Schools, hospitals and other public service organisations will be told to cut down on imported food and buy British instead under new guidelines unveiled today.

Public bodies – including the Armed Forces and government departments – currently spend £400million a year on cheap imported produce that could easily be grown in the UK.

But Government rules that make price the overriding factor in catering contracts are to be scrapped and replaced with new guidelines that prioritise other factors, including local sourcing.

From 2017, all food that can be bought locally will be – even if it is more expensive.

Whitehall will lead the way by launching the policy in its own departments, as well as the Armed Forces and prisons.

External bodies such as schools, hospitals and council-run care homes will be expected to follow suit.

David Cameron said last night: 'Our long-term economic plan is all about 
backing the do-ers and the hard-workers – and no one does more or works 
as hard in Britain today than our farmers.

‘By opening up these contracts, we can help farmers create more jobs, invest in their businesses and make sure people have a healthier lifestyle.’ 

‘It’s a triple win – and will mean a brighter future for our country.’

Britain currently imports 40 per cent of its food, including many products which could be produced domestically.

The Government is desperate to reduce imports, to support UK farmers and to end our reliance on unreliable foreign supply chains.

Ministers want to reduce the volume of foreign food we ship in that could easily be produced on home soil, such as New Zealand lamb, Spanish cucumbers and Danish bacon.

Former Environment Secretary Owen 
Paterson, who lost his job in last week’s reshuffle, has repeatedly 
highlighted the problem - and urged shoppers to choose British over 
foreign food.

But UK farmers have been unimpressed with a mismatch between rhetoric and reality.

This is because for all ministers’ words, the fact remained that Government departments were themselves buying £600million worth of foreign food - £400million of which could be produced in Britain.

The farmers claimed that a major problem was the Government Buying Standards, which include an overarching rule dictating that the cost of food trumps all other factors.

But the new guide will make clear that price is not the only factor, and aspects such as nutrition, and how and where food is produced should be taken into account.

Minette Batters, deputy president of the National Farmers Union, welcomed the plan as a ‘significant step in the right direction’.

She said: ‘I am delighted to have such 
support across Government departments enabling them to more easily 
source British produce.

‘Of course saying that more British food is sourced to our standards of production is one thing - to ensure that this happens on the ground, it is important that public sector buyers and caterers know that they can easily meet the plans aims by simply sourcing food to Red Tractor standards, the widely recognised mark of British food production standards.’

Liz Truss, the new Environment Secretary, added: ‘This move will mean that food served in canteens across the public sector can be more local, seasonal and tastier.

‘It will help drive growth in Britain’s first class food and drink industry and benefit the environment through reduced waste, higher take-up of meals and less unappetising food left on plates.

‘This is a huge boost to British farmers and producers and for students, patients and employees who want to enjoy fantastic food.’
