A lawyer for a woman who says Michael Jordan fathered her teenage son has withdrawn her paternity suit, but left open the possibility that it could be refiled.

Pamela Smith 'stands by the facts alleged in her original filing,' Atlanta attorney Randall Kessler told The Associated Press today.

Kessler said the lawsuit was withdrawn on Friday without prejudice, meaning it can be refiled.

Smith filed the suit herself last month against Jordan and asked that the basketball hall of famer take a paternity test and pay child support. She later hired Kessler's firm.

Jordan has denied that he's the father of Smith's 16-year-old son.

A lawyer for the majority owner of the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats has said Smith's divorce filings established her ex-husband as the father.

Jordan's spokeswoman Estee Portnoy on Monday confirmed that Smith dismissed the paternity suit.

Portnoy said there was no settlement or money paid to Smith. She said the lawsuit had no merit.

Kessler previously said the ex-husband hasn't paid child support or been involved in the teen's life.

Smith 'began this case without an attorney and did her best to file what she believed to be a legally appropriate case,' Kessler said in a statement.

'She then hired our firm just before the first court appearance. Ms. Smith has relied on our advice and determined that dismissal at this time, without prejudice, is in her son's best interests.'

The
teen, who uses the surname Jordan, has in the past taken to the 
internet to insist that the former Chicago Bulls star is his father.

According to TMZ, the woman was 
hesitant to bring Jordan's name through the mud but her teenage son 
begged his mother do everything she could to get Jordan to acknowledge 
that the boy was his son.

The star remains one of the most 
recognized sports figures in the world nearly 10 years after his 
retirement from the NBA and is considered by many to be the greatest basketball player of all time.

He was a 14-time NBA all-star, won six championships with the Chicago Bulls and was named the finals MVP six times.

On March 17, 2010, the NBA Board of 
Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase of the Bobcats, making 
him the first former NBA player ever to become the majority owner of a 
league franchise.

This is not the first time he has been 
the subject of a paternity suit - in 1991, his former lover Karla Knafel
claimed the star was the father of her child, but a DNA test proved 
that this was not the case.
