These pictures show the dramatic rescue of a one-eyed horse called Ruby, who had fallen into a cold river and was close to drowning.

The 21-year-old animal fell into River Irwell near Bolton, Lancashire, and had to fight to keep her head above the water.

Rider Karen Haslam had taken her out for a trot on Monday morning when the mare stumbled and fell as Ms Haslam walked beside her.

Miss Haslam grabbed onto Ruby's reins while calling 999 - and firefighters to rushed to the scene had to seek help from a nearby water aid unit to help pull her out.

A crew of 10 from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue finally pulled her to safety but not before she’d endured over an hour in the water.

In the end the crew had to call on even more colleagues to get her off the river bank.

Ruby, who lost an eye as a young horse after an illness, has since been given the all clear by vets.

Miss Haslam said: ‘I am so relieved that it all turned out okay and I would like to sing the fire service's praises.

‘Ruby kept so calm and coped brilliantly with the shock of being in the river.’
