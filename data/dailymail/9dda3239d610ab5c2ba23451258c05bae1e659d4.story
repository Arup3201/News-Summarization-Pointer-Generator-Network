In yet another classy PR stunt Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has launched the airline's new charity calendar by parading a line of half-dressed air hostesses through London.

The gimmick came just days after the company's boss was bombarded on Twitter after agreeing to host a question-and-answer session from customers.

During the Twitter session the airline's flamboyant chief executive apologised for his firm's 'over-abrupt culture' and vowed to improve their image.

The stunts are part of a drive to improve the public image of the airline, which was recently voted bottom of a 100-long list of brands by Which? readers.

Announcing new 'family-friendly' deals Mr O'Leary said Ryanair was 'evolving' becoming 'more sophisticated'.

But a line of half-naked women strutting their stuff through London's Victoria train station may not live up to the family-friendly image the airline is hoping to emulate.

The stunt, which is all for a good cause, aims to raise more than £85,000 for Ryanair's nominated charity for 2014, the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Since launching their first charity calendar the budget airline has raised nearly £600,000.

Ryanair’s Robin Kiely said: 'Ryanair’s
 fabulous cabin crew have selected Teenage Cancer Trust as the lucky 
charity that will receive all of the €100,000 proceeds from the 2014 
Ryanair Cabin Crew Charity Calendar sales, which will help support their
 27 specialist cancer units for young people across the UK.

'Every year 
10,000 copies of the Ryanair cabin crew charity calendar sell out in 
record time, so everyone who wants to help Teenage Cancer Trust with its
 work can buy Ryanair’s 2014 calendar on board, on our website, or from 
Teenage Cancer Trust’s website when it goes on sale shortly.'

The Teenage Cancer Trust is dedicated to improving the quality of life and survival chances for young people with cancer aged between 13 and 24.

Since the airline's first charity calendar in 2008, nearly £600,000 has been raised for good causes. The crew will also support the Teenage Cancer Trust's Shunburn campaign next summer

The charity funds and builds specialist units in NHS hospitals and provides dedicated staff, bringing young people together to be treated by teenage cancer experts.

During the summer Ryanair will be supporting the charity's Shunburn campaign.

Teenage Cancer Trust’s Interim Director of Fundraising, Kate Collins said: 'It’s fantastic news that Ryanair cabin crew have chosen to support Teenage Cancer Trust through the sales of the 2014 calendar.

'Around seven young people aged between 13 and 24 are diagnosed with cancer every day in the UK and the money raised by Ryanair staff and customers from calendar sales will help us to continue to provide them with the vital specialist support they need.'
