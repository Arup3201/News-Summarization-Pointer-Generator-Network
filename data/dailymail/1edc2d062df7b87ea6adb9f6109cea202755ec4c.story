If there's one man in football who knows how to deal with noisy neighbours, it's Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson.

The 13-time Premier League champion had to put up with Manchester City's millions for the last five years of his reign. Now former Swansea striker Gio Savarese has a similar task as manager of the New York Cosmos, who compete for affection locally with the English champions' sister club New York City FC.

Ferguson met up with Savarese and the club's star striker Raul for breakfast on Friday in Manhattan, and perhaps offered advice on how Cosmos could deal with their wealthier neighbours.

Born: June 27 1977 (age 37)

1994-2010: Real Madrid (741 apps, 323 gls)

2010-2012: Schalke 04 (66, 28)

2012-2014: Al Sadd (39, 11)

1996-2006: Spain (102, 44) 

Savarese has a considerable experience playing in the US, but had never managed a side before taking charge of the Cosmos in 2013.    

Ironically, Raul's first game will be against the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, now part owned by the Spaniard's former Real Madrid strike-partner Ronaldo. 

Cosmos enjoyed arguably their greatest spell with another Brazilian legend Pele in the late 1970s, and although Raul admitted the team wanted to entertain the crowd like their predecessors, he was more intent on creating a new golden era than trying to emulate former glory.

Speaking to ESPN about his recent move, Raul said: 'We shall aim to be an entertaining team, which plays football well. We want to catch people's attention, to win over the crowds. 

'The club's history will always be there, but now the club is starting a new chapter.'
