After 92 years in business, Disney has created its first ever Latina princess.

Princess Elena of Avalor, described as a 'confident and compassionate teenager,' will make her debut in 2016 on a special episode of Sofia the First, Disney's hit show for preschoolers.

'Our creative team has delivered a universal story with themes that authentically reflect the hopes and dreams of our diverse audience,' said Nancy Kanter, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Disney Junior Worldwide.

'What excites us most is the chance to use distinctive animation and visual design to tell wonderful stories influenced by culture and traditions that are familiar to the worldwide population of Hispanic and Latino families and reflect the interests and aspirations of all children as told through a classic fairy tale.'

According to a press release from Disney, 16-year-old Princess Elena lives 'in an enchanted fairytale kingdom inspired by diverse Latin cultures and folklore.'

After her Sofia the First debut, she will have her own spin-off series on the network, titled Elena of Avalor, also set to debut on Disney Junior in 2016.

Dominican Republic-born Aimee Carrero of ABC Family's Young & Hungry, 26, will be the voice of Elena, whose backstory is connected to the magical amulet Sofia wears on the show.

Princess Elena was imprisoned in the amulet by an evil sorceress, Shuriki, decades ago while Elena was trying to protect her little sister, Princess Isabel. 

Finally, Sofia 'discovers the truth . . . and sets out to restore Elena to her human form and help her return to the kingdom of Avalor.'
