At the beginning of March, we brought you Cristiano Ronaldo's new footwear advert... and now, the Real Madrid superstar has released a behind-the-scenes look at exactly how it was filmed.

The 'CR7 footwear' clip sees a twinkle-toed Ronaldo showing off some impressive dance moves to promote his new brand of shoes, and the latest installment has revealed the secrets behind the shoot.

Unseen in the advert itself, Ronaldo's moves are perfectly choreographed by a dancer, with the Madrid man simply copying his off-camera expert.

The video reveals the secret to Ronaldo's dance moves... he is copying a choreographer off-camera

The shoot takes place in a studio, and the 30-year-old can be seen laughing between takes as he gets to grip with the dance moves.

The advert was all in aid of his new CR7 franchise, which got off to a bad start when Nike forced Ronaldo to withdraw a line of trainers from his collection in the belief that it competed directly with one of their own.

Nike pay the Portugal forward around £5.5million a year, and according to reports, he would have needed prior consent from the sportswear giants to release a similar trainer, which he did not have.
