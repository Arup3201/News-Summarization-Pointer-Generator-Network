Snow has finally arrived in the Alps after skiing resorts endured one of the worst starts to their season in recent memory.

Vehicles were pictured in a massive jam near some of the best known resorts in France as winter sports enthusiasts made a dash for the mountains amid blizzard conditions.

It comes just days after weather experts predicted the snow-starved region was in line for up to 30 inches of snow and as icy conditions caused havoc in Britain.

Finally: The snow has arrived in the French Alps after parts of the region endured one of the worst starts to the winter sports season in recent memory

Some of France's top skiing destinations had been void of snow while openings were delayed in a number of resorts with the slopes bare.

It came after a spell of unseasonably warm weather that has persisted throughout December - until now.

Images emerged yesterday of thousands of cars lining snow-covered roads near Albertville on the way to the Tarentaise valley in the heart of the French Alps.

It comes after a huge weather system moved in over the area bringing a massive downfall. 

The sight of falling snow is certain to have brought a sigh of relief to frustrated resort operators and others whose livelihoods depend on traditional winter weather, and will no doubt have delighted British skiers who were planning a winter getaway.

Families have shown up over the Christmas break to find slopes bare in some resorts.

The situation was such that bosses at the resort of Les Gets, in the Northern Alps, turned on snow cannons to fill slopes with man-made snow.

Yesterday's snow storm is expected to be followed by colder temperatures, meaning the snow will stick around handing a major boost to the ski tourism industry. 

In a ski report issued amid a mild Christmas, Meteo France said snow is non-existent or very low on all ranges up to 5,000ft and there is only a small amount of snow on ranges from 5,900ft to 6,500ft.

But the national weather service said such a lack of snow is not that unusual as it occurs roughly every five years.

High in the French Alps, particularly in the Savoie and Haute-Savoie regions, the latest values have made this season one of the ‘least snowy’ winters in 35 years following the warmest year on record in France.
