Fire crews aided by ambulance staff assisted in the removal of the 320kg woman

Emergency crews have undergone a carefully planned removal of a 320kg New Zealand woman from the bedroom of her home where she spent years growing heavier until she 'couldn't move hardly at all.'

Carpenters and fire crews spent up to two hours  disassembling a large window of the woman's Canterbury home, where she lived with her 82-year-old father, before hoisting her and the mattress she laid on onto a loader and into a waiting ambulance outside.

It took two hours in total from the start of the 9am operation on Thursday, to transfer the 54-year-old out and take her to Christchurch Hospital where eight firemen, aided by several ambulance and hospital staff, carried her inside.

A St John Ambulance spokesman said the woman's life was not in immediate danger nor was it an emergency rescue - but a carefully planned procedure at the request of the family.

The most difficult part of the operation was figuring out the best way of exiting her from the house, after efforts to remove the 54-year-old through the front sliding door failed because she didn't fit.

The father of the woman told stuff.co.nz his daughter ate 'normal' food but had grown heavier during the past eight years.

She was housebound, unable to work or drive and 'couldn't move hardly at all,' the father said.

She lived in a flat behind his house, but he cooked for her and helped her clean. He described his daughter, who spent a lot of time playing the computer, as 'a large girl.'

'She couldn't leave the house,' he said.

Her GP had urged her to lose weight but had not diagnosed the condition.

He said she would be tested for Lymphedema at Christchurch Hospital, a condition that increases a person's weight because of an inability of fluids inside the lymph nodes to drain properly.

NZ Fire Service's Christchurch assistant area commander, Greg Crawford, whose staff where involved in the transfer, told Daily Mail Australia his crew had assisted in 'human lifts of over 200kg all the time' but admitted this was the heaviest woman he could recall ever having to move.

'The father passed a comment that this woman was getting fairly big - which is probably the understatement of the year,' Mr Crawford said.

'Lifts similar to this are common practice, but I imagine this would be the biggest lift, certainly the biggest lift I can recall ... 320kg is fairly chunky.'

Operations such as this were known to create minor injuries for the staff involved, in particular, back and leg strains from the overbearing weight.

He said firefighters had about one call-out a month to help ambulance staff lift someone who was obese and two firefighters had recently sustained minor back strains from doing so.

The central city rescue truck carried a purpose-built lifting sheet with handles "for that very reason", Crawford said.

A St John Ambulance spokesperson has declined to comment citing privacy reasons while a comment is still being sought from Christchurch Hospital.
