A senior Labour MP today launched a devastating attack on party leader Ed Miliband’s faltering leadership.

Former minister George Mudie broke ranks to accuse his leader of failing to set the agenda and raised serious doubts about the party's hopes of winning the general election.

He added that he had no idea what Labour’s policy was on vote-winning areas including, education, welfare and the NHS.

Trouble at the top: Labour leader Ed Miliband is under pressure to make a bigger impact

Mr Mudie’s decision to speak out publicly echoes growing private concerns at senior levels of the party that Labour is failing to make an impact on voters.

In one poll this week Labour was just three points ahead of the Tories, a lead which Mr Mudie might not ‘withstand’ a major battle during the general election campaign.

Questions have also been raised about why the party has failed to capitalise on David Cameron and Nick Clegg going on holiday at the start of the summer recess.

In a devastating interview Mr Mudie said he was ‘deeply worried’ about the Opposition's prospects at the general election, admitting that he did not know its policy on welfare or education.

Mr Mudie, who was one of the first MPs to call for Tony Blair to quit, said Mr Miliband is 'always cocooned' by people around him and suffers from a 'bunker mentality'.

He also suffered from being 'young', the battle to defeat his brother David in the leadership election and the influence of trade unions.

The former education minister told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: ‘I have difficulty knowing what we stand for now.

‘We are 18 months away from an 
election thinking that we will put out a document on all these major 
items and the public will say “Oh great”.

‘At the moment, the Government are setting the agenda, making the weather and we're responding to it.’

He warned the last two Labour leaders did a better job of dominating the political landscape.

‘Tony Blair and Gordon Brown never did that... We're not setting any agenda, we're responding to the Tories.’

Mr
 Mudie, a close ally of Mr Brown, said to get back into power Labour had
 to ‘demonstrate to people that we are relevant to their lives’.

If the party was not ‘offering something different’ people would ‘stick with what they have got’, he warned.

‘There
 has to be and there is some concern that the lead we have in the polls,
 first of all is not firm enough, big enough,’ he added. ‘Will it withstand a general election discussion?

Worried: Labour MP George Mudie attacked Mr Miliband's for the party's confused stance on key issues

‘But the real thing is, do you know, because I don't, know our position on welfare, do you know our position on education, do you know our genuine position on how we'd run the health service?

‘If you're not getting a clear enough message to me, and to some of my colleagues, what are you, what kind of message do you think you're putting out there?

‘I remember before we won, 1992, the five years to 1997, this place was bubbling, we were energetic, we were at them, we thought we had all the answers.

‘We're not at them and we're slightly hesitant and we're slightly confused and I deeply worry about that.’

Sadiq Khan, Labour's shadow justice secretary, hit back insiting Mr Miliband had been doing 'heavy lifting' to prepare for government.

He told the BBC: 'We haven’t got the luxury that George had between ’92 and ’97 of being out of power for 18 years.

'That means learning the lessons, but doing the heavy lifting. And what you’re right to remind me of, is in two and a half years, as a new leader - you’re not the Prime Minister - you need to make an impression on the British public pretty swiftly.

'And that’s what we’re seeking to do by setting the agenda.'

But Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘This is all starting to sound very familiar.

‘Ed Miliband offers weak and directionless leadership to an increasingly restless Labour Party.

‘If he is too weak to  control his own party or stand-up to union barons, how can he possibly stand-up for the hardworking people of Britain? As the senior and respected Labour MP George Mudie says himself, ‘why would you vote Labour?”’

Miliband is 'cocooned' by cronies and failing to take the fight to the Tories
