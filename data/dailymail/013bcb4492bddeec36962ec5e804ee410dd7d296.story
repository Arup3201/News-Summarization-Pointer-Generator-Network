England cricketer Jonathan Trott has pulled out of the Ashes tour and flown home blaming a stress-related illness after his team's dramatic loss to the Australian hosts.

The 32-year-old father of one will now take an indefinite break from the sport as he concentrates on recovering from the condition that his coach said he'd been battling 'for quite a while'.

Trott's decision to leave the Ashes and fly home came shortly after Australian batsman David Warner told a press conference the Englishman's performance had been 'poor and weak'.

The news of the England No. 3's decision to pull out came after England went down in flames in the first Test at the Gabba stadium in Brisbane.

Trott said in a statement: ‘I don’t feel 
that it is right that I’m playing knowing that I’m not 100 per cent and I
cannot currently operate at the level I have done in the past.

‘My priority now is to take a break 
from cricket so that I can focus on my recovery. I want to wish my 
team-mates all the very best for the remainder of the tour.’

As he flew home the English team's managing director Hugh Morris and head coach Andy Flower told the media Trott's decision to pull out was taken jointly with the team management.

And they said no date had been set for Trott's return to international cricket.

Morris
said: ‘Jonathan Trott is an incredibly talented cricketer who has 
proven himself time and again for England.

'The cricket side of things is
unimportant now. All that matters is that Jonathan is given the time, 
support and space he needs to recover.

‘We
fully support his decision to leave the tour and the ECB will provide 
all the assistance we can to help Jonathan and his family through this 
period.

‘Jonathan has asked for privacy while he recovers and I would urge everyone to respect that.’

England coach Andy Flower was asked whether it was a mistake to bring Trott on the tour, but he responded: 'Jonathan has had a very successful international batting career so far and has managed himself and this condition during that time.

'We have systems in place and personnel in place to support our squad members that might have struggled in different areas and those systems and individuals have always dealt with these situations successfully.

'We had high hopes Trotty would have a great tour. It hasn't worked out that way. Hopefully he will come back stronger in the future.'

Trott's exit from Australia came 48 hours after he was criticised by Australian batsman David Warner.

Speaking after a poor performance by 
England on day three of the current series Warner, 27, said: 'England 
are on the back foot - it does look like they've got scared eyes at the 
moment.

  'The way that Trotty got out today was pretty poor and weak'

  - Australian batsman David Warner

'The way that Trotty got out today was pretty poor and weak.'

He added: 'Obviously there's a weakness there and we're on top of it at the moment.'

When asked if Warner's comments had had a direct influence on Trott's exit, Flower said: 'That would be inaccurate.

'As
I said earlier, Jonathan has been struggling with this condition for 
quite a while and has managed it very successfully but we've been on 
tour for about a month.

'He's had his ups and downs through that month and it is not directly related to that.

  'I think players commenting about fellow professionals in the media is disrespectful'

    - England coach Andy Flower

'I would also say that I think players commenting about fellow professionals in the media is disrespectful.

'I think on this occasion he has got that horribly wrong.

'I
think we set different standards to that and one of the reasons we 
don't like commenting about opposition players is because we don't know 
what is going on their dressing room, we don't know what is going on in 
their private lives.'

And England captain Alastair Cook said: 'I think the comment by David Warner was pretty disrespectful to any professional cricketer really.'

Reaction: Former England international footballer Gary Neville wished Trott all the best on Twitter

Sympathy: Former England opener Marcus Trescothick was also quick to react

Get well soon: Trott's England teammate in the shorter forms of the game, Luke Wright, also took to the social networking site to pass on his best wishes

Good health: Former England player Paul Collingwood also joined the chorus of good luck messages

Trott’s
England team-mates were aware of his condition, which he has been 
managing successfully for some time, but it is understood neither 
Cricket Australia nor the Australian players knew.

But while the England dressing-room viewed Warner’s comments as disrespectful, there was no suggestion at all that 
Warner’s remarks contributed to his decision to leave the tour.

Former England batsman Nasser Hussain, speaking on Sky Sports, said: 'You just don't know what is going on in someone's mind and its obviously a highly stressful situation and it just tipped him over the edge.

'He was the glue that held England's batting line together.

'This will come as a real shock to the team and everyone involved around the team. I think England were right to bring him - playing Test match cricket is tough, you have to give them the chance to play.

Sports stars immediately took to Twitter to pass on their best wishes to Trott. The former England opener Marcus Trescothick, who abruptly returned home from a tour of India in 2006 and the 2006-2007 tour of Australia and later retired because of depression, wrote: 'Sad news, hope trotty is ok.'

Luke Wright, an England teammate of Trott in the shorter forms of the game, said: 'Hope Trotty is ok. The Ashes are important but there are bigger things in life than just cricket. Hope he is back well soon.'

Former England international footballer Gary Neville added: 'Hope Trott is OK and back soon. Test cricket is tough and we are going to see a major Ashes battle in the next few months.'

Former England opener Marcus Trescothick, now 37, can sympathise with Jonathan Trott because he went through something similar seven years ago.

His problems first surfaced in 2006 when he flew home from Baroda in India after breaking down in the dressing room.

Later that year he was selected for the 2006-2007 Ashes tour but after two weeks in Australia he flew home in November 2006 citing 'a recurrence of a 
stress-related illness'.

In 2008 Trescothick tried to travel with colleagues on a pre-season tour of Dubai but got only as far as Heathrow, where he was found sobbing in the Duty Free area.

In September of that year the likeable cricketer published his autobiography, Coming Back To Me, in which he talked about his depression and revealed he'd suffered from panic attacks from the age of 10.

He never played for England again, but instead concentrated on playing domestic cricket, which he said meant he was never more than three hours away from his family.

Two years ago cricketer Michael Yardy flew home to his family from the 2011 Cricket World Cup suffering from depression.

The then-30-year-old left his hotel in India where the players had been cooped up because of security fears to go back to his wife and two small children in England.

The former Sussex captain said afterwards: 'It got to the stage where I couldn't cope any more.  I was out of my comfort zone.

'I wasn't getting out because security was so tight and I'd lie awake until 3am.'
