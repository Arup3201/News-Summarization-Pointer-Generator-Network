Elegantly decorated and lit with twinkling chandeliers, these sumptuous interiors wouldn't look out of place in the most exclusive of London homes.

But  this townhouse, from scullery to top-floor boudoir, stands at just over 4ft tall - and every step, door and window has been built in miniature.

Modelled on a Regency property from 1815, this very grown-up dolls' house is the handiwork of Tim and Angela Hartnell, who charge customers upwards of £4,000 for one of their miniature masterpieces.

Welcoming: The dining room  opens out onto the entrance hall through double doors. A separete servants' door can be seen in the corner

Lavish: Guests would be led into the home through the entrance hall, above, before being taken to the reception rooms upstairs

The couple, from Norfolk, spend weeks carefully constructing, painting and finishing each home that they make. And their attention to detail is paying off - the waiting list for one of their made-to-order creations is more than a year. 

Mr Hartnell, a former software developer, quit his job in 2008 to focus full-time on his passion for dolls houses. His wife, Angela, left her position as a librarian earlier this year to begin working for their company, Anglia Dolls Houses, full-time.

Mr Hartnell focuses on building the main form of the dolls house - measuring and carving the birch plywood to each customer's specification - while his wife specialises in painting, decorating and marbling the homes.

The Hartnells have a series of standard designs that they then adapt to suit each individual client - offering bedrooms, attics and wine cellars as optional extras. 

For the paint, the couple use Farrow and Ball colours as they are 'consistent' and easy to find - wherever in the world the house ends up.  

Mrs Hartnell said that, while her husband has had no formal training, his work makes the most of his 'extreme eye for detail'. 

Detailed: The four-storey home, pictured, has been built so that each room can be accessed through a logical series of doors and corridors

This attention to every finishing touch and final flourish is what sets their work apart from others who construct these miniature homes, she added.

Mrs Hartnell told MailOnline: 'He always tries to get over the feeling of it being a real house. With them you have always got room behind rooms.

‘You can see how it all works together. That is one of the things that Tim always does, he gets the rooms behind the rooms.’ 

In the Kensington house, for example, the Hartnells needed to consider the need for domestic staff, because that is what homeowners of the time would have been thinking about.  

It means that running behind each of the elegant reception rooms is a servants' corridor - accessed through concealed 'jib' doors - that all lead down to the scullery and kitchen. 

Retreat: The study has been finished by Mrs Hartnell with thoughtful flourishes, such as the hourglass  placed on the fireplace

Hidden from view: The scullery (pictured left) can be accessed by servants without walking through the main rooms of the house

Finishing touches: Flickering light fixtures on the back wall bring warmth into the basement kitchen of the Kensington House, pictured

Authentic: A panelled library, like the one pictured above, can be added to any dolls house as a collectors upgrade for an extra cost

Bespoke: For the Kensington model, pictured above, the Hartnells added a side portico (seen on the right) which sits above a wine cellar

Looking at the designs, it is clear that Mr and Mrs Hartnell carefully considered how a visitor to the home would move through the space. Each room is accessed through a logical series of doors and corridors - and each staircase has been placed in a realistic position.

Even the flickering fireplaces -  included as part of the standard package - align with chimney breasts and chimney stacks.

Another subtle touch that adds to the 'realness' of the pieces is the  proportions of the rooms. It means, as Mrs Hartnell explains, that any miniature furniture that their customers buy fit in the space without throwing out the sense of scale - which is 1/12. 

The grandness of their rooms can be viewed by pulling the house open from the front or the side panels. 

Mrs Hartnell said: ‘You get these magical views. It is not just a set of pigeon holes like some dolls houses can be. That is very much Tim’s thing. That is not common at all.

But despite the accuracy, Mrs Hartnell said that they are designed to be 'played with' and not to be used as 'architectural models'. Though she admits that those enjoying their works are usually adult collectors - not children. 

'Ready to move in': Staff call bells, attached to bell pulls in various rooms of the house, hang on one of the walls in the basement
