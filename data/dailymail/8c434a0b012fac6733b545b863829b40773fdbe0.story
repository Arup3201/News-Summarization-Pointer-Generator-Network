RAF jets were caught in a near-miss above a busy city centre when pilots commanding the flights became 'startled' by two other aircraft flying above them. 

Two Hawk fighter jets were performing a training flight in July when two Tornados some 500ft beneath them began their climb.

Pilots were forced to divert from their path to avoid collision above Sunderland, a report into the incident revealed. 

The Tornados were flying above Sunderland when they became 'startled' by two Hawk fighter jets flying 500ft above them, a report has found. Above, two Tornado GR4s on a combat mission to northern Iraq

The mishap occurred after the Tornados completed a training exercise at RAF Spadeadam in Cumbria. 

Above Newcastle, the Hawks came into pilots' sight, with just two to three nautical miles separating the two formations, the Airprox Board report found. 

While the Tornado pilots knew the Hawks had been flying in the same airspace, they were told by air traffic controllers that the aircraft had begun their own climb.  

'The pilot reported that having been told that the Hawks were climbing, he had expected the separation between them to increase,' the report concluded. 

'He noted that under a Traffic Service the controllers were not required to achieve deconfliction minima and that separation was the pilots’ responsibility, and that in this case, had he not elected to level off they would have climbed straight through the Hawk’s level. 

'Although 500ft vertical separation would be considered sufficient in many circumstances, the Board considered that because the Tornado crew were not expecting to see the Hawks only 500ft above them, they were probably startled by their proximity.' 

The report concluded the mishap may have been the result of information being given to pilots via air traffic in a different format than is usual. Above, two Hawk jets of the 100 Squadron 

The confusion, it was said, could have been the result of air traffic information being given in an unfamiliar BRRA format. 

An RAF spokesperson said the Ministry of Defence could not comment about individual employees, but said: 'Safety is of paramount importance to us and safety considerations continue to be at the core of all our aviation activity.

'We welcome the recommendations made in the report and will use the lessons learnt from this incident to do whatever we can to prevent it from happening again.'

In September 2013 a Hawk jet overshot the runway at Anglesy during a training flight after crashing into a stray goose.

Last October an American F-15 crashed in the Lincolnshire countryside during another practice exercise.

It is not known what caused the incident that is now being investigated by aviation authorities.
