A former vice cop who now works as a full-time pastor will star in a new reality show that aims at getting women off the street.

8 Minutes will center around Pastor Kevin Brown and his work trying to get prostitutes and escorts in the Los Angeles area to give up their work and go straight.

And though the show is not set to air until next year, Brown has been doing this work for years now.

Saved: Pastor Kevin Brown will star in the new reality show 8 Minutes in which he will have eight minutes to try and convince a prostitute to give up the lifestyle and go straight

Changed man: Brown, who has spent years trying to save and help women, used to be a vice cop

'This is one of those great shows that was actually happening whether anybody was shooting it or not,' executive producer Tom Forman told EW.

'Brown told his congregation that for 20 years he’s had to arrest these women when what he’s really wanted to do is help them. It launched a drive within his church to run these undercover operations. We read that and thought somebody should put a camera on this.'

Brown works to target woman he feels have been forced into the business, something he is good at after all his years working in vice.

He then meets them in a room pretending to be a client, and offers them the chance to quit, providing the assistance they would need to leave the lifestyle. 

The show will follow these interactions, as well as life after for women that have chosen to leave.

'Women have burst into tears and said, “I’ve been waiting for someone to offer me a path out,”' said Forman.

'And you have women who say, “I’m doing what I’m doing and I’m not doing anything else,” and they decline.'

Way out: Even the women who refuse his help get a number to call should they change their mind

As for the eight minutes, that is a safety protocol for the girls, this way if they decline they can go back to their pimps, should they have one, and just claim Brown was a cop without causing any problems.

If they do not accept his help, Brown does still leave the women with a phone number to contact him later. 

In addition to Brown, the show will also have safety lookouts to make sure nothing turns violent and former prostitutes who the Pastor previously saved from the lifestyle to talk to the girls.

8 Minutes will air on A&E.
