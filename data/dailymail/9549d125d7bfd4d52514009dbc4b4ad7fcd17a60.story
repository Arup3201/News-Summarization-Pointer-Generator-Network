Monaco look like they have won the race for England Under 21 winger Tom Ince after setting up talks with him in London on Thursday.

Blackpool boss Paul Ince drove his son to the capital to meet Monaco representatives for discussions over a pre-contract deal to join the French club at the end of the season.

Ince Snr hit back in a statement on Friday but did not deny that he had been in London. He said: 'I don’t need to explain to anyone what I do personally

Out of contract: Ince's Blackpool deal expires in the summer and he is free to talk to foreign clubs

United front: The Inces have been working together since Paul took over Blackpool in February 2013

Monaco target Tom Ince started this season superbly, scoring  six goals in 11 matches. However, he and Blackpool have struggled since then and the forward has scored just once in his 13 subsequent appearances. Maybe moving to Monaco will be a gamble that pays off...

'My focus is on 
Blackpool Football Club totally and will always be. We shouldn’t let 
rumours, like Swansea the other day, get in the way of this club trying 
to move forward.'

There
 was confusion at Blackpool over Ince Snr’s whereabouts after he pulled 
out of a press  conference ahead of Saturday’s Championship game at 
Barnsley. It is believed he was also due to meet chairman Karl Oyston to
 discuss transfer targets.

Instead of talking to the press, he 
responded to a request from Monaco to meet Tom, who is out of contract 
in the summer and has been free to talk to foreign clubs since January 
1.

Ince insists his son will be at Blackpool until the end of the season: 'Thomas loves playing for this club and loves the fans. It’s only natural he will move on eventually, but that will not be in this window.

'He wants to help the players and fans stay in this league.'

Oyston has stood by his manager so far but the Monaco move for 
Blackpool’s top scorer with seven goals this season is bound to test 
their relationship.

Ajax and Inter Milan are the other continental 
clubs pursuing the former Liverpool prospect, while Swansea and 
Tottenham have expressed interest in offering him an opportunity in the 
Barclays Premier League.

But wealthy Monaco are in pole position 
after holding negotiations over personal terms and outlining their plans
 for trying to challenge Paris Saint-Germain at the top of the French 
league.

With Tom a free agent in the summer, Blackpool look likely to
 be left chasing around £155,000 in compensation, whereas they could 
claim up to £4million at a tribunal if a deal was struck with an English
 club.

The move comes as boss Ince calls on Oyston to provide funds, 
with Blackpool down to just 12 fit first-team regulars. They have made 
enquiries about Leeds’ Luke Varney and Cardiff’s John Brayford.

Oyston
 revealed Ince had handed him a list of more than 20 transfer targets, 
yet no new signings have been made. Ince said: ‘I’ve sat down with the 
chairman to see who we can bring in. It’s not easy because in January 
everyone wants to wait until the end of the window to make their move.

On the run: Radamel Falcao completed a £53m move in the summer despite interest from Real Madrid

International recognition: Ince is a key part of Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 set-up

‘We need quality and we need people in. But all these things cost money and unfortunately we aren’t prepared to do that.’

The
 Blackpool boss is under pressure after a run of eight defeats and a 
draw, yet has vowed not to quit. He was booed after Saturday’s home 
defeat by Middlesbrough, while fans also unveiled a banner demanding 
that Oyston quit.
