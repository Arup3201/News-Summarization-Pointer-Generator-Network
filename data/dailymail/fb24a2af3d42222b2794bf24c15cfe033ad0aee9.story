The Ronnie Barker sketch tapes were hidden away for 40 years after the BBC show was not given a third series

A series of Ronnie Barker radio sketches which have remained unheard for more than 40 years could finally be broadcast - thanks to a producer described as 'the most boring man in the world.'

John Fawcett Wilson, produced the comic's popular BBC radio show 'Lines From my Grandfather's Forehead' between 1971-72.

When a third series was turned down, Mr Wilson broke BBC rules by taking the copies home with him.

And Terence Brady, Barker's co-star and co-writer, said he was unlikely hero: '(He was) probably the most boring man in the world,' he told The Times newspaper.

'A quite singularly dull man and yet he did an enormous amount of good work. We all liked him very much, but to do comedy with him was really weird, because he was one of these people with no sense of humour at all.'

The show featured a series of off-the-wall sketches and characters including Barker as a 17th century character with two heads.   

When Mr Wilson died in 2011 the collection of tapes was passed on to a voluntary organisation in the West Midlands devoted to classic television and radio called Kaleidoscope.

The Ronnie Barker tapes were then passed to sound engineer Keith Wickham who has restored them for the BBC.

BBC Radio 4 Extra has confirmed it is actively considering how it may be able to use the new tapes, The Times reports.

One of Britain's best-loved comedians, Ronnie Barker died of heart failure in 2005 aged 76.

Earlier this month, his paedophile son Adam Barker, 44, was freed from jail 13 weeks after being jailed and is expected to inherit more than £1.4million left to him by his mother Joy Barker.

Adam was jailed in October last year for child porn offences after being on the run in Hungary for eight years.
