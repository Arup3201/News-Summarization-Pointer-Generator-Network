An airplane carrying 190 people narrowly avoided crash landing at JFK Airport on Tuesday morning.

Frightened passengers were told to assume the brace position after the nose gear on TAM Airlines Flight 8078 from Rio de Janeiro to New York appeared to be stuck sideways as the plane prepared to land.

Disaster was averted when the landing gear finally locked into the correct position with the plane was just 50 feet above the runway.

'It was like the hand of God turned the wheel,' said a Port Authority rescuer, and part of the disaster response crew, reported the New York Post.

'Everyone was panicking inside the plane,' said Rio resident Anna Maria Falcao, 33.

'Even the crew was running around panicking, saying "Don’t worry, no one’s going to die." So many people were crying,' said Falcao, who was traveling to New York with her one-year-old son, her husband and her mother.

Following discussions between the pilot and authorities at JFK, the plane twice circled airspace above the airport so controllers and rescuers
 could get a look at the twisted nose gear.

On the third circle, the nose gear finally dropped down, but the 
wheels were turned at a right angle. 'It appears cocked at 90 degrees,' a
 controller radioed one of the pilots.

Ready for the worst: On the tarmac the Port Authority was prepared for whatever emergency response was necessary

Finally, and with Port Authority prepared on the tarmac for emergency response, the plane was given clearance to attempt to land on Runway 31L, the longest at Kennedy Airport.

As the plane started its descent, passengers were told to adopt the brace position by putting their heads in their hands.

Fortunately all emergency preparations proved unnecessary when the landing was successful. The plane landed 'without incident' 
at 11 a.m. and was able to taxi to the gate under its own power.

On board, passengers’ fright turned to applause for their skillful flight crew. The pilots could also be heard on radio transmissions thanking the air traffic control tower for their assistance. No one on-board was injured.
