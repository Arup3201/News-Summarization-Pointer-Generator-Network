One mother has revealed how she makes butter out of her own breast milk. 

Michelle Cohn, 26, of Rockville, Maryland, shared pictures of her creation on Reddit, calling it 'butter that I made without ever leaving my house! Pretty cool.'

Describing the flavor afterwards, she told MailOnline: 'It was very sweet and it was very creamy - it was really good.'

The final product: Maryland mother Michelle Cohn made butter using nothing but her own breast milk

Ms Cohn, who has a 16-month-old daughter, shared the simple process she used.

The idea occurred to her when she was home alone for the first time since her daughter was born.

'I needed to make sure that I kept my milk production up,' she says.

'So I was hand expressing into a little container and then I remembered one time I was at a fair and they had a butter-making contest, where they had milk in jars and you shook it. 

'So I wondered if you could do that with breast milk. I looked it up online and sure enough, you could and I did it.'

Sole ingredient: Ms Cohn started with a container filled with her own breast milk

More volume: She then moved it to a larger container, and continued to add milk

She says the first time she tried it, she used about two ounces of milk, and after she shook it for about 45 minutes, the first butter began to form. 

She shook it for another 15 minutes, which yielded a small amount of butter - the size of a soybean.

'The next day, I put a little bit of milk in the fridge overnight and I added to that the next day, but a lot more - closer to eight ounces - and I started shaking. And that time, within about two minutes, I had butter,' she says.

Ms Cohn says the result was 'not all that different from regular butter.' 

Solid goal: After vigorous shaking for 45 minutes, the butter began to form and she placed it in this pan

I can't believe it's butter: Ms Cohn spoons up some of the final product

While another Reddit user claimed to have made cupcakes with breast milk butter and fed them to her family, Ms Cohn said she hasn't shared hers with anyone else, and prefers to save her milk for her daughter.

She adds: 'I think the idea of an adult person consuming breast milk or a product of breast milk is sort of novel, so people are unsure how to react to it.'
