CLICK HERE for Sportsmail's brilliant Match Zone from Sunderland's draw with Chelsea 

Sunderland could not quite put the Black Cats among the pigeons in the title race by defeating Chelsea, who emerged from this stalemate still top of the Premier League, unbeaten and on course to be ‘Invincible’ this season.

But the hosts did, with great resilience, show that the London club are not unstoppable and, in doing so, gave a glimmer of hope to challengers that the season is not blue all over just yet.

Sunderland’s manager Gus Poyet pulled no punches in his programme notes about the disparity in quality between the teams. ‘Everybody knows that Chelsea are better than us technically, physically and mentally,’ he wrote.

He added that, ‘you need to compensate for that with the team performance’.

And he knows what he is talking about. Sunderland beat Mourinho’s Chelsea in the clubs’ last two meetings. They inflicted Chelsea’s last defeat, at Stamford Bridge in the league in April and Sunderland also won the meeting before, a home game in the League Cup last December.

The visitors poured forward from the first whistle and it was clear that Poyet’s game-plan was rooted in containment and counter-attacks. The first six minutes exemplified this with Chelsea pressure then a break ending in Seb Larsson setting up Connor Wickham, whose shot was blocked. Cue the next period of pressure, with the three-man line of Willian, Oscar and Eden Hazard playing behind Costa and revolving their chances. A Willian cross came pinging in. Santiago Vergini side-footed it out. Hazard shot over the bar. Oscar crossed, low and to the centre, Sunderland cleared.

Oscar then shot low from the D, the ball deflected and Costel Pantilimon dived to save. Costa ran the ball into the box and worked it to Willian, whose right-foot shot hit the post.

Occasionally Sunderland got away, Wickham smacking over the bar, Jack Rodwell shooting from distance. And then the blue waves came again.

The sturdy home defending should not have been such a shock. Take away the 8-0 drubbing by Southampton and, before Saturday, Sunderland had conceded just 11 goals - the second-lowest tally in the division.

John O’Shea’s perfectly timed tackle on Costa to cut off the clear and present danger from a beautiful through ball from Cesc Fabregas was symbolic of the defiance and application.

Again Chelsea pressed. The pre-match talk was about whether Chelsea can be invincible all season, as only Preston in 1888-89 and Arsenal in 2003-04 have ever been in England’s top division. They certainly have match-winners in all areas.

Sunderland                                109.7      68.2

Sebastian Larsson       90          11.8       7.3

Adam Johnson             90          11.3       7.0

Lee Cattermole             90          10.9       6.8

Chelsea                                     108.5     67.4

Cesc Fabregas            90           11.5      7.1

Nemanja Matic             90           11.3     7.0

Eden Hazard                90           10.5     6.5

Nemanja Matic surged forward, one shot blocked and then one missed. Then Hazard, Oscar and Costa all had shots blocked. As the intensity of the occasion reached the sidelines, referee Kevin Friend sent Poyet’s assistant Mauricio Taricco to the stands. Play resumed with Chelsea right-back Branislav Ivanovic having a shot blocked by Pantilimon. And then Sunderland came the closest either side came to scoring in the first half. 

Lee Cattermole fed Vergini, whose chip from inside the area clipped the bar and tipped over the top. With the home fans urging them on, Sunderland pushed on again.

The longer Chelsea went without scoring, the more Costa became frustrated and tetchy. Late in the first half, after a tangle with O’Shea, he kicked out. That he missed his target is irrelevant and he was fortunate not to be booked.

He did, however, receive a yellow card in the 55th minute for knocking Wes Brown in the face with his trailing arm while jumping.

The chances continued to be created by Chelsea and thwarted. Hazard: blocked. Fabregas: saved. Costa: blocked.

Poyet then made a double substitution to inject fresh legs into his tiring team, Jozy Altidore replacing Steve Fletcher and Jordi Gomez on for Rodwell. Sunderland pushed forward, Wickham’s shot in testing Thibaut Courtois.

Altidore also proved a handful, running at Chelsea late on and having a shot deflected into Adam Johnson’s path with six minutes left. Johnson could only hit his own effort wide of the target.
