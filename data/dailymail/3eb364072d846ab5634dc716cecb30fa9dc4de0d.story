Delayed inquiry: Ben Cowburn, 18, killed himself in 2010 after falling out with the TV comedian

A gay celebrity who is alleged to have groomed a teenager before he killed himself has contacted the youth’s grieving family to ‘explain’ their relationship.

But last night the parents of Ben Cowburn spoke of their dismay at the TV comedian’s use of high-profile libel lawyers Carter-Ruck to make the approach.

The Cowburns have so far refused to respond, insisting the celebrity – known only as Mr X after a coroner controversially protected his identity – should first be questioned by the Metropolitan Police.

They have sent a formal request to detectives asking that he be interviewed about Ben’s disclosure of homosexual rape and other sex assaults.

Ben was 18 when he was found dead in his bedroom at a psychiatric unit in 2010 after telling medical staff he had been raped by the celebrity. 

‘The letter from this man’s lawyer asks whether we would accept a letter giving his personal explanation,’ said Ben’s mother Sharon, 52.

‘It’s a sounding-out letter offered in a cautious manner. We would welcome an explanation and are considering this approach. But we are not used to dealing with media lawyers.

‘It makes things even harder for us. We are still grieving for Ben. The police never questioned this man and we think they now should, perhaps before any letter is sent. There remain many unanswered questions.’

Her husband Steve, 51, added: ‘What I don’t want is for Mr X to send us a letter full of platitudes – we took him to a few parties, he had a good time, it was all fine – that kind of thing.

‘I’ve emailed the investigating officer to ask why he never interviewed Mr X, given he’d seen words like sexual abuse, cocaine and rape used by witnesses.

Revealed: How Tthe Mail on Sunday broke the story

At the inquest the experts agreed Ben was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder linked to a single event or events in London.’

Before his death at Longreach House mental health unit in Cornwall, Ben named Mr X and told nurses how he had been raped and sexually assaulted during drug-fuelled parties involving group sex.

The celebrity’s attempt to contact the family follows a series of Mail on Sunday exclusive stories questioning the authorities’ response to Ben’s death.

We revealed how Cornwall Coroner Dr Emma Carlyon declined to call key witnesses – including the nurse in whom Ben confided about being raped – and how she concealed Mr X’s identity through an informal agreement with lawyers.

The Cowburns, from Truro, want Chief Coroner Peter Thornton QC to review her handling of the inquest and explain why it took more than three years to arrange.

They are also pressing for an inquiry into care standards at Longreach after three families contacted them about the deaths of their own children there. Mrs Cowburn says one case is ‘shockingly similar’ to her son’s and believes that ‘people are dying in there’.

She and her husband have passed a dossier of complaints to their MP, Conservative Sarah Newton.

Last month a jury returned an open verdict at the end of an eight-day inquest into Ben’s death, a result indicating insufficient evidence surrounding his death.

The court heard how he was ‘groomed’ by Mr X after moving to study in London in September 2009. He was then aged 17. 

In July 2010 the comedian and Ben fell out and the teenager’s mental health deteriorated. He made a series of apparent suicide attempts and was admitted to Longreach where he said the celebrity gave him expensive gifts and cocaine and left him feeling ‘dirty and used’.

On one occasion he said the older man climbed uninvited into his bed, engaging him in a sex act.

However, Metropolitan Police Det Con David Gadsby told the inquest there was ‘no conclusive evidence’ that Ben was raped.
