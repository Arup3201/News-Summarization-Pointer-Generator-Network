I had a caesarean section 27 years ago – and still have a small bulge over the top of the scar, which seems to hang over the waistband of my size eight trousers.

It’s not the end of the world but it does bother me. I’m  58 now, can you recommend any exercises that will help?

I suspect you’re not alone in your problem. These days roughly a quarter of all births are by caesarean, making it one of the most common of all surgical scars.

Women who have this operation find that afterwards fat deposits unevenly over the front abdominals – perhaps because of the way the tissues are cut and then heal – and this can be difficult to get rid of.

It must be frustrating for you because, as a size eight, you’re obviously slim elsewhere.

It doesn’t sound like you need to lose weight, so going on a diet to reduce your overall body fat percentage probably won’t help.

In terms of exercise, you don’t give any clues about what you’re doing already, but any workout that targets the core muscles should be your first port of call.

Pilates is specifically designed to target this area, with the majority of the moves focused on engaging the core muscle group.

Although it’s very hard to reduce fat in a specific area, by improving muscle tone and posture, you might find your tummy’s appearance does get better.

You could see if there’s a studio or class you can get to locally, but working one-to-one with an instructor in your own home will probably yield faster results. It’s not as expensive as you might think – take a look on pilatesunion.com.

Given your age and that you had your surgery some time ago, it could be that the bulge is mainly sagging skin due to a loss of elasticity.

A while ago, the only option might have been a mini tummy tuck.

It’s an increasingly popular option but I’m ambivalent about cosmetic surgery. It’s a major operation  with a host of risks and a lengthy recovery time, even though the surgeon might be able to use the same  incision point as your caesarean, meaning no further scarring. Today there are a wealth of non-invasive options that use ultrasound, radio frequency, heat and freezing among other things to tighten skin and spot reduce fat.

They do work but again there are risks and you really do need to do your homework.

If you take this route, make sure you visit a qualified and experienced therapist, and not just some hairdresser who has decided to buy a fat-zapper machine.

Go nuts: Almonds and other nuts and seeds could help with oestrogen production

Your recent response to one reader’s battle-of-the-bulge question, in which you suggested she increase her intake of foods that move excess oestrogen through the system, was really interesting. But are there any oestrogen-stimulating foods  to avoid?

This is a great question, as there’s some confusion around the idea that cruciferous vegetables – such as cabbage, cauliflower and sprouts – and citrus fruits, avocado, nuts, eggs, organic dairy products (and tea and coffee) have ‘anti- oestrogen’ properties.

I spoke to the London-based nutritionist Jackie Lynch for an expert opinion on this, and she had some different ideas.

The key thing is to limit saturated fats, such as red meat or cheese.

High levels of saturated fat in your diet can block the action of the essential fats such as omega 3, which play a key role in hormone balance.

These produce anti-inflammatory prostaglandins and can help relieve symptoms of oestrogen-dominant conditions such as heavy or painful periods, or endometriosis.

So replacing saturated fats with foods rich in essential fats such as raw almonds, walnuts, pumpkin or flax seed and oily fish, could combat the effects of excess oestrogen.

Jackie also told me that foods  containing plant compounds called isoflavones are considered to have hormone balancing properties  – think lentils, chickpeas, beans  and soya.

Eating organic where possible, will also reduce exposure to xenoestrogens – oestrogen-like chemicals which may be found in pesticides or plastics, for example.

Cruciferous vegetables contain indole-3-carbinol, which helps to encourage the elimination of excess oestrogen, though Jackie says she generally doesn’t advocate tea or coffee, despite the potential antioxidant content, as they can deplete vitamins and minerals which may affect hormone balance and impact blood sugar levels.

This generates the release of stress hormones, which, when out  of balance, can impact the balance of other hormones in the body.

Looking for some motivation to go the extra mile in your workout – why not take the dog with you?

We reported last month that Stand Up Paddleboard Surfing (SUP) is the fastest growing watersport in the world. One newly revealed fan is Mamma Mia! actress Amanda Seyfried, who has been taking her Australian Shepherd Finn out on the water with her.

She posted this picture, right, on Instagram last week, along with the caption: ‘It was surprising, at first, that Finn was so eager to jump aboard. Now I can’t enjoy paddling without him.’

From the look on her face – and his – they’re having a whale of a time.

In New York I see people running with their dogs every day. They live in such tiny apartments, they need all the exercise they can get – but it works both ways. Research by the Kennel Club has shown that more than a third of dogs in the UK are overweight – and their owners are likely to be less fit too.

So, if you are looking at Rover thinking perhaps he could lose a couple of pounds, he might be thinking the same about you…

The latest craze in fitness-mad NYC? Precision Running – that  is, a specially designed treadmill workout that combines intervals of varying speed and incline with brief recovery periods.

Personally, I’m not a fan of running – I get bored  too quickly – but when  I attended a class at my local Equinox gym the time flew past, with the instructor constantly changing the pace and intensity. Interval running used to be the domain of elite athletes,  but as some studies suggest it helps burn more calories in a shorter time period, as well as improve cardiovascular function faster than continuous-intensity exercise, it’s  no wonder it’s becoming  more popular.

To try it out for yourself, after a warm-up run hard for two minutes so you get very out of breath, followed by two to three minutes of easy jogging or fast walking. The secret is actually in the recovery, as this is what allows you to really go for it in the next hard interval – but it still takes some discipline to push yourself to your limit.

This is where classes come in, as it helps to have somebody telling you how fast and high to set your treadmill. I was amazed what I could do when I took myself out of my running comfort zone for once.
