Scotland's mountain resorts have more snow than parts of the Alps and Sochi, but skiers are being advised not to take on the slopes because of the risk of avalanches.

The Ski Club of Great Britain has reported depths of 285cm at Glencoe Mountain, 250cm at Cairngorm Mountain and 200cm at Nevis Range.

This comes after they reported a depth of only 128cm at Whistler in Canada, the host of the 2010 Winter Olympics, a few days ago.

Avalanche risk: Staff at Glencoe Mountain Resort worked in sub-zero temperatures to clear the 14ft snow drifts

Depth: The huge amounts o snow virtually engulfed lifts on the slopes. Mountain Rescue have said there is an extremely high risk of avalanches

Massive snow drifts in the Scottish mountains have also caused more avalanches already than the the entirety of last winter.

The SportScotland Avalanche Information Service said the risk in Lochaber was 'high' while the other four mountain areas the threat was 'considerable.'

A spokesman from Lochaber SAIS said: 'Further deposits of fresh unstable windslab will continue to build on the existing deep accumulations lying in sheltered areas, mainly on North through East to South-East aspects above 850 metres where avalanches will occur.

'Unstable windslab will also be present on other aspects. Cornices will be unstable and prone to collapse. The avalanche hazard will be High.'

The huge snowfalls have led to safety warnings being imposed by mountain rescue.

Covered: The slopes in Scotland had more snow than some European and North American ski resorts, and boasted bigger depths than the runs in Sochi

Taking advantage: Some skiers and snowboarders ignored the avalanche warnings at Glenshee ski centre

There have been 159 avalanches in the Scottish mountains so far this winter - 80 in the last month alone - and 30 more than last season, with many more weeks of the season left.

The number of fatalities caused by avalanches during the 2012-13 season was the highest in years.In all, eight people were killed in avalanches on Scottish mountains last winter.

Nineteen of the 129 avalanches recorded last winter were triggered by human activity.

Heavy snowfalls, freezing temperatures and powerful winds have also created spectacular, and some potentially dangerous, conditions on Scottish hills and mountains.

Cornices, edges of snow overhanging high crags, are a common feature - and risk - of most winters.

However, this season's frequent strong winds coupled with big dumps of snow have seen some larger than usual cornices in ranges such as the Northern Cairngorms.
