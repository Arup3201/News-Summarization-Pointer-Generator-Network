The sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, has ordered his jails to stop serving meat to inmates in a move he says is meant to cut costs.

Joe Arpaio, who has sparked controversy in the past for his treatment of inmates, claims the change will save $100,000 annually. 

The jails will be replacing meat with soy, Arpaio says.

Fox 10 Phoenix reporter Troy Hayden traveled to a prison kitchen with Arpaio to check out the newly altered recipe for a menu item that the inmates call 'slop.'

The soupy, lumpy substance is shown in a giant vat as Arpaio dumps various ingredients into it, including flour, olive oil, peas, carrots and the new ingredient: soy.

Hayden points out that the carrots have some unknown brown substance mixed in with them.

'What is that?' Hayden asks.

Arpaio laughs and says, 'There's probably a little dirt in it, don't worry about it.' He then dumps the so-called vegetables into the vat.

Arpaio also dumped these carrots into the mixture. Hayden pointed out there there was an unknown brown substance mixed in with the carrots

Arpaio grimaces after tasting the 'slop' that he just made while inmates look on

'That's not good. It's not. I don't care what you say,' Hayden, left, says after taking a bite of the soup

Hayden also questions the soy, which he likens to wood chips. 

When he asks Arpaio if the 'slop' looks appetizing to him, Arpaio responds that it looks 'great' and says he's already getting hungry.

'Your kidding, right?' Hayden asks. 

Arpaio is later shown eating a small spoonful of the 'slop' while inmates working in the kitchen look on. 

Arpaio claims aloud that it's tasty, though his grimace says otherwise - and Hayden calls him out.

'That's not good. It's not. I don't care what you say,' Hayden says after taking a bite of the soup.
