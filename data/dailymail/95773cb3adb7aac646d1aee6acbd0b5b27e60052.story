Quelle surprise, Arsenal sign another ‘wonderkid’.

Yes, despite the obvious need to strengthen his senior squad,  Wenger has forked out a seven-figure sum to land Polish teenager Krystian Bielik. Wenger has bought Bielik for a reported £2.5million.

Shouldn’t he have spent on an established player?

Possibly but the Gunners were not the only club chasing Bielik. Hamburg, in Germany, had also registered an interest in the 17-year-old and would have completed a move this month if Arsenal hadn’t swooped. 

He made his debut for Legia Warsaw when he was only 16. He played six times for the club, including once in the Europa League, before putting pen to paper on a deal to take him to London.

OK, so what are his attributes?

At 6ft 2in, Bielik seems physically equipped for the Premier League. Wenger has described him as an energetic central midfielder and his manager at Legia, former Manchester United player Henning Berg, believes Bielik has a maturity in his play that is beyond his years.

'He has good techniques, is able to keep the ball,' Berg is quoted as saying in legia.sport. 'For his age he has a very developed ability to make appropriate decisions. Personality sets him on the field. 

'At the first training was a kid who wanted to kick the ball. In his debut,  he played as if it was just another game. He does not crack. We had to teach him  tactically, but  individual skill was already at a high level.'

The new Patrick Vieira?

It’s too early to make such grand claims but those who have watched Bielik report many similarities.

Bielik thrives as a holding midfielder but his versatility means he also provides an option in central defence. 

Berg's claims of Bielik's clever decision making in that area of the field would certainly align him with the likes of the former Arsenal captain, whose commanding presence on the pitch has never been replaced by Wenger.

If he can nurture Bielik's potential, then perhaps he may have found a successor.
