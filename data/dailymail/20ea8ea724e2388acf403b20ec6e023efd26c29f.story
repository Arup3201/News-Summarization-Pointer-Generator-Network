The Christian mother who was put on death row in Sudan for refusing to convert to Islam is finally on her way to a new life in the United States.

Meriam Ibrahim, who was imprisoned for apostasy after refusing to renounce her Christian faith, left Rome this morning on a flight bound for Philadelphia, according to the campaigner who secured her release.

The mother-of-two, accompanied by husband Daniel, a U.S. citizen, and children Martin and Maya will then change planes to fly to New Hampshire, according to Antonella Napoli, director of Italians for Darfur.

Courage: Meriam Ibrahim holds her daughter Maya in her arms as she leaves Rome for Philadelphia

The family of four are planning to start afresh in America in Manchester, the hometown of Daniel’s brother, Gabriel Wani.

They spent the previous week in Rome after being spirited out of Sudan in the dead of night on an Italian state aircraft. 

Meriam and baby Maya, who was born while her mother as shackled in prison, were blessed by Pope Francis who thanked her for her courage and praised her ‘courageous witness to faith’.

The brave mother said she was a little anxious about the new start.

Daniel, a trained chemist, lost his job while in Sudan supporting his wife through her ordeal in prison so they will be reliant on their extended family, at least at first.

The entire four will be cramped into Daniel’s one person apartment in Manchester.

She said: ‘ I’m a bit scared to leave Rome. We have been very happy here. We have felt like a real family. ‘

She said that they had toured the city as they waited for the final arrangements to be made for their travel, including an emotional trip to the ancient Roman amphitheatre where thousands of Christians were martyred for their faith.

They also prayed in one of the cities most famous churches, St Paul outside the walls.

She said: ‘We saw the whole city, we went to the Colosseum, we went to mass on Sunday, and we went shopping. We returned to life. And now I don’t know what to expect but at least we will all be together. ‘

Daniel was more confident. He said: ‘My brother will help us I’m sure and the Christian community in New Hampshire will be with us. The future is always unknown but I am optimistic.’ 

The quotes were relayed by the campaigner Antonella Napoli who saw the couple off at the airport.

She said the visit to the the Colosseum 'touched' the courageous Christian but the entire family had been 'moved by the welcome they had received in Rome'.

The nightmare began a year ago when Meriam was accused of converting to Christianity, by relatives who allegedly wanted to take over her business.

She insists she was brought up a Christian although her father, who left the family when she was very young, is a Muslim.

A month ago Meriam was released but was detained again on the way to the airport pending fresh legal proceedings.

After weeks at the US Embassy amid tense negotiations between the Italian and Sudanese authorities she was released and flown to Rome immediately.

The couple were given a private apartment during their week in Italy, where they were able to live as a family for the first time since the birth of their daughter.

They were kitted out with new clothes and driven around the sights by armed police, for their security.

When they arrive at the airport in New Hampshire they are set to be welcomed by the Sudanese and entire Evangelical community, as well as Daniel’s brother and his family.
