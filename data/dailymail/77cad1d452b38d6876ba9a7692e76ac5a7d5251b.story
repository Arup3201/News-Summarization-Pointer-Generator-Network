A brave woman who was sexually assaulted when she was a child by a predatory rapist known as the Pied Piper waived her anonymity to ensure he was jailed today for 25 years.

Darren Purchase, who  lived above a sweet shop in order to 
have access to young victims, dragged Helen Alexander into his home in Worcester 
when she was 10-years-old and sexually assaulted her on the sofa.

Ms Alexander, now 38, stayed silent for decades before agreeing to be interviewed by police when they contacted her as a potential victim.

Brave: Helen Alexander waived her anonymity to urge other sex abuse victims to come forward

A court heard the attacker would befriend youngsters by buying them sweets, cigarettes and alcohol, then subject them to horrific sexual assaults.

The 44-year-old abused at least eight children over three decades - beginning when he himself was a child of just 13.

Purchase was finally arrested after his male victim discovered that he was still spending time around children, and contacted the police in an effort to stop him attacking anyone else.

He was convicted of abusing seven female 
victims and one male between 1984 and 2011 - and one victim described 
him as a 'Pied Piper' figure who had scarred her for life.

The serial rapist was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted on 18 counts - including rape, indecent assault and buggery - at Worcester Crown Court.

Speaking after the sentencing, Ms Alexander spoke of her ordeal.

She said: 'He knew my brother, I didn't have much contact with him other
than saying hello on my way back from school.

'Then one day I was on my way back, still in my uniform, when he called me over to sit on the step outside his house.

'We were talking and he was asking lots of questions about school - I said, "What do you bloody want to know for?"

'He said if I swore again he would smack my bottom. Being a cheeky kid I said, "I can bloody well swear if I want to."

'At that he grabbed me by the arm and 
pulled me into the house. He took me into the front room and put me on 
the sofa where he proceeded to sexually assault me.

'I managed to kick him away and escape
eventually. I screamed that I would tell my mum what had happened but 
he threatened to tell her I had been swearing if I did.'

Ms Alexander said she is still terrified when she thinks of what Purchase did to her.

'When I saw him in court after all 
these years I had heart palpitations,' she said. 'I held it together 
during my evidence but when I came out of court collapsed in a pile 
outside.

'The damage to my mental health has 
been long-lasting. I was walking through Worcester with my son several 
years ago when I saw him again. I almost collapsed.

'He was walking along and had all 
these children around him, following him. The best way of describing it 
was that he was like the Pied Piper.'

Ms Alexander urged anyone else with historical sexual abuse allegations to contact police.

She said: 'From telling my story I've 
had lots of people say, "That happened to me too." I would just say 
don't keep it bottled up, talk to someone about it.'

Alex Warren, prosecuting, told the court 
that one of Purchase's victims had come to view him as a 'big brother' 
figure, adding that another victim had been 'excited' about visiting the
defendant's flat when she found it was above a sweet shop.

Judge Robert Jucker told him: 'This is a remarkable catalogue of sexual offending by any standards.'

He added that the rapist had 'enticed' his victims by plying them with treats, in one case winning over an entire family to gain their trust.

'You worked your way into the family's affections by plying them with food and cigarettes,' the judge said.

'Through [the male victim] you befriended a group of his friends who were significantly younger than yourself.

'You were the man that could supply them with a car and cigarettes - and you did.'

Speaking after the case, Detective Inspector Jon Wallis, of Worcester CID, said: 'Purchase abused boys, girls and women and seems to have been completely indiscriminate in whom he targeted; except that most of his victims were vulnerable in some way and Purchase ruthlessly took advantage of that.

'We first became aware of his offending when his teenage victim from the 1980s got together enough courage to contact the police and report what he had suffered.

'He had not only been sexually abused, but to make him compliant, Purchase introduced him to glue sniffing, alcohol and cannabis at a young age.

'He also exposed him to hardcore pornography, a recurring theme in Purchase's crimes.

'I want to thank all those who supported our prosecution, took part in the trial and had the strength to come to court and relive those terrible experiences.

'I particularly want to thank the woman Purchase systematically raped over several years and has blighted her life.

'Their evidence means we could put a stop to Purchase's relentless offending and, I think, stop many others from becoming his victims.

'I want any other victims of historic sexual abuse to know that they can have the confidence to contact the police about what they have suffered.

'We will treat their reports seriously, prosecute where possible and at the very least refer them to support services.'
