Recent strange events at an Iowa restaurant have the owner and his employees spooked.

Pat Orr, owner of Chuck and Edna’s Maid-Rite, in Cascade, enlisted the help of Iowa City Ghost Hunters to investigate a series of unexplained phenomena in the restaurant that started April 14.

The first seemingly unexplained disturbance took place just before 6pm April 14. The store’s security camera captures an amorphous shadow 
at the restaurant’s dishwashing station that slowly forms into what 
looks like a person and drifts off screen.

Haunted: Pat Orr owns the Maid-Rite in Cascade and says he can't explain the human-shaped shadow that was captured on security footage

Unexplained: Security footage shows this dark shadow in a place in the restaurant where no shadow can be made

The video shows the feet of a
 Maid-Rite employee at the edge of the frame, but the employee told Orr 
she saw nothing unusual.

'(Employees)
 have been saying they’ve seen strange things ever since the place 
opened, and (I) blew it off until I saw the video,' Orr told the 
Telegraph Herald.

'It
 looks like it’s coming out (from underneath the cooler), goes across 
the floor and up over the dishwasher,' Orr said. 'But, you see, I can’t 
make a shadow here. I don’t know. I don’t know what it is.'

Orr acknowledged the figure could have been an insect on the camera lens.

Then,
 at about 10am April 19, another security camera shows a stack of 
Styrofoam cups sliding off a shelf and hitting a worker in the head, 
while another stack falls sideways as if it was pushed.

Another night, Orr was alone in the office doing paperwork when he heard a metal spatula fall to the ground, he said.

'It
 was on the cooler at the end of kitchen, and I found it on the floor in
 the middle of the kitchen in front of the fryer,' as if it had been 
flung across the room, Orr said. 

Spirit or bug? Orr admits the shadow could be a speck or a bug crawling across the camera

Normal day: A staff member was working close-by at the time the footage was captured and noticed nothing out of the ordinary

Not
 knowing what to make of the events, a manager typed 'ghost hunters' 
into the Web browser on his smartphone and pulled up Iowa City Ghost 
Hunters.

Matthew
 O’Brien, 30, of Iowa City, and his team of paranormal investigators 
spent the early morning hours one day last month at the restaurant, 
recording audio, video and electromagnetic field readings and trying to 
re-create the shadow.

Among
 the devices they use to record paranormal activity is a 'ghost box,' a 
modified portable radio that continuously scans AM and FM radio bands. 
When on, it is believed to create white noise and audio remnants from 
broadcast stations that entities are able to manipulate to create words 
and sentences. O’Brien said audio and video recording devices are 
portals for the supernatural to communicate.

The
 team also tried to provoke activity by talking to the entity and 
placing flashlights on tables around the restaurant, asking the spirit 
to turn them off or on to respond to questions.

O’Brien,
 an entrepreneur by day who is attempting to launch a cleaning service, 
said he and his team still are reviewing all the evidence collected and 
can’t say whether the restaurant might be haunted.

He
 would not share what the team encountered during its investigation, 
saying Orr signed a confidentiality agreement preventing him from 
disclosing evidence gathered.

Fall or pushed? A stack of cups falls onto a worker as she prepares food in the Maid-Rite in Cascade

Odd: Cups fell every which way as if they were pushed, says Orr

O’Brien said the team also is researching the history of the property dating back to the 1800s to see what else has been on the land.

Orr said the site was a vacant lot when he purchased it about five years ago, but he recalls seeing an old, undated photo that shows a building on the spot that sold ice-cream.

At one point, the site also was home to a grocery store, tavern and feed store. Behind the restaurant, across an alley, sits a house that was once a funeral home and next door was an ambulance garage, Orr said.

Bradley Burt, Maid-Rite president and CEO, has not seen the tapes and is dubious of the paranormal research.

'But Pat is a good operator, and if it creates some curiosity and interest around town and brings more people to his restaurant, that’s OK,' Burt said. 'He’s having some fun with it, which is fine. I chuckled when I first heard about it. I thought it was amusing. Can’t say I’ve heard of anything similar at other Maid-Rite locations.'

Orr remains baffled by the disturbances and has named the supposed ghost Charlie after his father, Chuck.

'Could it have been a bug on the camera lens causing the shadow? I suppose,' Orr said. 'But I can’t explain the cups or the spatula. ... What I do know is my four-year-old niece won’t come in the restaurant. Fortunately, if it is a ghost, it’s been a friendly one so far.'
