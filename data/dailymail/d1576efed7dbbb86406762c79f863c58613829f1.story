The leader of a far-right Ukrainian group which played a major role in overthrowing the former president, Viktor Yanukovich, was shot dead by police last night.

The
 Interior Ministry said Oleksander Muzychko, also known as Sashko Bily, 
was killed by officers of the 'Sokol' special unit as he tried to escape
 from a cafe in the western Ukrainian region of Rivne.

But an independent Ukrainian lawmaker has claimed Mr Muzychko, who had previously said he feared being shot by police, was executed.

Far-right Ukrainian leader Oleksander Muzychko was shot dead by police last night, officials have announced

Mr Muzychko, also known as Sashko Bily, was a member of the hard-line Right Sector and the group's coordinator for western Ukraine, the country's nationalist heartland bordering the European Union

Interior Minister Volodymyr Yevdokimov told a news conference in Kiev: ‘At
 the moment of arrest, at shouts of "Stop! Police!", Muzychko fled, 
jumping through a window, and opened fire.'

The 
officers returned fire, killing Mr Muzychko, he said.

Mr Muzychko
 was a member of the hard-line Right Sector and the group's coordinator 
for western Ukraine, the country's nationalist heartland bordering the 
European Union.

Police said he was wanted for ‘hooliganism’ and an 
attack on a local prosecutor.

Russia
 - which cited the likes of Right Sector as justification for its move 
to annex Crimea and protect the peninsula's ethnic Russian majority from
 Ukrainian ‘fascists’ - said this month Mr Muzychko was under investigation
 for fighting alongside rebels in Russia's Chechnya region in the 1990s.

Contradicting
 the police account, independent lawmaker Oleksander Doniy said on his 
Facebook page that Mr Muzychko had been executed.

Mr Muzychko had previously 
said he feared being killed by police.

The Interior Ministry said he was killed by officers of the 'Sokol' special unit as he tried to escape from a cafe in the western Ukrainian region of Rivne

Police said Mr Muzychko was wanted for 'hooliganism' and an attack on a local prosecutor

‘Two
 vehicles cut off his car,' wrote Mr Doniy.

'He was dragged out and put in one of them. 
Then he was thrown on the ground, hands cuffed behind his back, two 
shots to the heart.'

President Yanukovich 
triggered peaceful street protests in late November by making a U-turn 
away from the European Union and towards closer ties with Russia.

Right 
Sector raised the protests to a new level in January by attacking police
 vehicles with petrol bombs and bricks. 

Mr Muzychko had previously said he feared being killed by police

It provided much of the muscle 
as clashes with police grew more serious.

Mr Yanukovich fled after two days of gun battles in February between police and protesters, in which 95 people were killed.

Right Sector leader Dmytro Yarosh said he plans to run for president in a May 25 election, but is a rank outsider.
