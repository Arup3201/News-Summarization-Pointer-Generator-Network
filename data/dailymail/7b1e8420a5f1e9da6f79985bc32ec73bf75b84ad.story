An extraordinary letter written by the future King Edward VIII to his first mistress in which he expresses frustration at having to go to the opera rather than see her has come to light.

The 25-year-old Prince of Wales told married socialite Freda Dudley Ward of his excitement at sleeping with her and even used the F-word in the two-page note, which is expected to fetch £1,800 at auction.

However, he lamented that he was forced to attend the opera with his family and would not be able to see her until late at night.

Lovers: A letter from Edward VIII to Freda Dudley Ward full of gushing terms of endearment has come to light

Passion: The letter was written by Edward when he was the 25-year-old Prince of Wales in 1919

Edward, who was known by his middle name David at the time of the 1919 letter, would later abdicate the throne in order to marry his lover, American divorcee Wallis Simpson.

But his first furtive dalliance was with Mrs Dudley Ward, who was at the time trapped in a loveless marriage to a prominent MP.

The couple had a five-year affair after they met while sheltering in a doorway during a zeppelin raid in the First World War.

The letter, which was revealed after the collector from Birmingham who owned it died, is full of gushing terms of endearment, as well as swear words which Edward replaced with dashes.

It is headed 'Buckhouse SW' - indicating that the prince wrote it from Buckingham Palace.

Note: The letter was sent to Mrs Dudley Ward at her London home near Marble Arch

Together: Edward pictured with his lover and her husband, Liberal MP William Dudley Ward

It is addressed to 'my darling beloved little Fredie', and reads: 'Bless you for your two sweet little letters which have made me so so happy particularly the last one saying that you are arriving back this evening and suggesting that I shld look in after the opera.

'Oh! No I could'nt (sic) possibly do such a common thing as that - - - !!!! I am so so overjoyed at the thought of seeing my own precious darling little girl again so soon.

'I ought to be able to get round about 12.00 and I'll let myself in as I've (still) got the key!

'It's so so divine of you wanting your little David to come and you just can't think how happy you've made him belov'd one and how much it makes him love and adore you.

'I only wish I could come earlier but I'm told the - - opera can't be over before 11.30 so it can't be helped tho. I do say f- - - !!!!

'So till midnight Fredie darling darling tho it's a shame to keep you up so late tho how madly happy I am how how I'm looking forward to "after the opera" when I shall sleep and probably snore!!'

On sale: The letter was found among the papers of a collector in Birmingham and is now going up for auction

The prince concludes by promising 'all my very great love and more kisses than I'm capable of sending my very own darling beloved precious little Fredie,' and signs off: 'Your devoted and adoring petit amoureuse David'.

The letter will go under the hammer at Fellows auctioneers in Birmingham on November 25.

Mark Huddleston, from Fellows, said: 'It is safe to say that Edward gets a little bit carried away in this letter.

'The letter is fascinating, as it is as if Edward had no self-censorship when writing it. He spills all his thoughts and feelings down onto paper without giving it a second thought.

'The result is a rather colourful letter that makes for quite cringy reading, peppered with terms of endearment like sweetheart and darling.

'Edward doesn't seem to be that interested in going to the opera - he makes it quite clear he would rather be cavorting with Freda.

'Edward obviously had a penchant for married women because by the early 1930s he was with Wallace Simpson and Freda's attempts to contact him were blocked. She was totally cut out of the equation.

'This letter is a fascinating piece of royal history. It is a private window into the heady relationship between the infamous Prince and his mistress in their first months together.'

Playboy: Edward was known for his louche lifestyle and would later abdicate in order to marry his mistress

The prince, who was notorious for his playboy ways and string of lovers, reluctantly became king in January 1936 following the death of his father, George V.

However, he abdicated in December of the same year after Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin told him he could not marry Mrs Simpson, and the throne passed to his younger brother George VI, father of the present Queen.

The former King, who took the title of Duke of Windsor, went to live in Paris where he became a prominent society figure, and died in 1972.

Freda Dudley Ward divorced her first husband, Liberal MP William Dudley Ward, in 1931 and married Pedro Jose Isidro Manuel Ricardo Mones, Marques de Casa Maury in 1937.

They divorced in 1954 and she died in London in 1983 aged 88.

Note: The letter was scribbled when Edward was at Buckingham Palace with his family

My darling beloved little Fredie

Bless you for your two sweet little letters which have made me so so happy particularly the last one saying that you are arriving back this evening and suggesting that I shld look in after the opera.

Oh! No I could’nt possibly do such a common thing as that - - - - !!!!

Sweetheart, how can you say 'or shall we wait till Tues'? Of course I must come and am so so overjoyed at the thought of seeing my own precious darling little girl again so soon. I ought to be able to get round about 12.00. And I’ll let myself in as I’ve (still) got the key!

It’s so so divine of you wanting your little David to come and you just can’t think how happy you’ve made him belov’d one and how much it makes him love and adore you.

I only wish I could come earlier but I’m told the - - opera can’t be over before 11.30 so it can’t be helped tho. I do say f - -- !!!!

We lunched and dined with Rosemary and Eric at Fleet yesterday & brought Loughie back to 65 in my car afterwards. I went over to Swinley Heath in the afternoon where I played golf with Arthur of Connaught after which I looked up Violet at Fern Hill and saw the babies: it was the babies that I really went to see not that my visit was very much appreciated I don’t think tho. I just loved seeing them again sweetheart as they are so divine. But I’ll tell you all about it to-night and now I must stop or I shall be late for a family dinner.

What I think of the opera!! I’ve been 'slumming' all the afternoon and have just had a game of squash with DO No 2 who is writing to Sheila which won’t surprise you.

So till midnight Fredie darling darling tho it’s a shame to keep you up so late tho how madly happy I am how how I’m looking forward to “after the opera” when I shall sleep and probably snore!!

All my very great love & more baisers than I’m capable of sending my very own darling beloved precious little Fredie

Bless you!!

Your devoted & adoring petit amoureuse David
