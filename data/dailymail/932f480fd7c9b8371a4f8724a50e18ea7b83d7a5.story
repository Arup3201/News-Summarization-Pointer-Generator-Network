A former primary school teacher hanged herself after her 'meticulous' and 'perfectionist' nature left her struggling to cope with both work and her family life, an inquest heard.

Nicola Worrall, 32, was so conscientious she quit her job after putting herself under undue stress due to the pressures of her workload.

Her mental state then worsened after she had a baby with her husband David and her life 'spiralled out of control' when the couple split up and the boy went to live with his father.

Former primary school teacher Nicola Worrall made detailed handwritten notes on how to hang herself shortly before she took her own life

Ms Worrall had previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was receiving treatment for her condition at the time of her death.

Her body was found at her home in Poutlon le Flyde, Lancashire by her father Graham Lawton and his partner Lorraine.

Nicola Worrall resigned her job as a primary school teacher because she struggled to cope with the pressure

An inquest at Fleetwood was told Lancaster University educated Ms Worrall had suffered with anorexia following her mother’s death when she was 13 which she had 'taken quite deeply'.

After graduating, she trained to be a teacher and got a job as a primary school but left and later got a promotions job within the NHS.

Mr Lawton told the hearing: 'She was very close to her mother probably closer than she was to me. She probably hid it quite well really but it did affect her quite deeply. She suffered from anorexia probably partly caused by that.

'She was a very meticulous girl and if anything, overprepared. She was very good at what she did and the school started to put more onus on her because she was capable of it. In the end she couldn’t cope with the additional pressure.

'I knew Nicola was very, very keen to be a mother. It’s fair to say that we weren’t totally convinced it was a wise decision probably because of her mental health and putting more pressure on herself.'

The couple went on to have a little boy but almost immediately after his birth she became unwell again. She was admitted to the Wythenshawe Specialist Mother and Baby Unit where she remained for around eight weeks.

Ms Worrall split from her husband David soon after giving birth to their son because of her illness

Mr Lawton told the inquest he and his son-in-law visited Mrs Worrall virtually every day. But the couple later split and their son lived with David and and following a change in medication she was admitted to Parkwood Mental Health Unit at Blackpool Victoria Hospital.

Mr Lawton told the inquest his daughter’s mental health was 'fluctuating' but she was discharged under his care to live with him. She then moved into a flat by herself just half a mile away from her father.

He added: 'Very occasionally, sometimes she would be very low but we thought we could convince her there was still a positive future for her. She didn’t give any indication that she would take her life, it wasn’t of any great concern.

'It was one of the things that was in the back of your mind but not an immediate threat.'

Bipolar disorder was previously known as manic depression and can cause extreme mood swings.

Approximately one person in one hundred is at risk of developing the condition.

Sufferers can experience episodes of deep depression followed by intense mania. 

The condition's symptoms depend on whether the patient is suffering depression or experiencing mania.

Often these episodes can last for several weeks or longer.

In many cases a patient may only feel 'normal' for very short periods. 

It is very important for someone at risk of bipolar disorder to get a correct diagnosis as patients during depressive episodes may decide, like Nicola Worrell (right) to take their own life. 

Often a patient will be diagnosed with clinical depression first before doctors identify the manic element of the illness. 

Anyone experiencing symptoms of depression and are considering harming themselves should contact their GP immediately or the Samaritans. 

During manic episodes a patient may feel very happy and can even go on spending sprees on goods that they do not need.

The mania can also prevent a patient from eating or sleeping properly. 

There are a range of treatment options available for sufferers including long-term medication to counter the mood swings.

Also patients can learn how to identify early warning signs of either depression or mania and seek appropriate help in time.

Some patients also benefit from psychological treatment and therapy to counter depression.

Also, regular exercise is thought to help with the symptoms.

The hearing was told Ms Worrall had returned to work due after her condition improved but this soon changed.

Community psychiatric nurse Wendy O’Connell said: 'She was enjoying being back at work and she was glad that she was achieving things again. initially when she went back to work she was coping.

'I was on leave just prior to her death and her mood fluctuated again and she started to have worries about work, feeling that she wasn’t doing her job properly and she was actually on sick leave.

'Work had noticed changes, first she was aiming high and then struggling. With Nicola being so conscientious, we had done some triggers for her to look out for.'She added: 'Nicola was a bit of an open book in respect of the way she looked, she looked very worried all the time almost like a rabbit caught in headlights, she had that look about her.

'I think like her dad said, it was always in the back of your mind the possibility that it would come to this and we were putting everything in place.

'But she always said to me that she would never do anything to harm herself because she would never do that to her dad and family.'

Mrs O’Connell said that Ms Worrall had a planned appointment with the team on Wednesday,  December 11 last year yet received a phone call from a worried colleague who hadn’t been able to contact her.

She then contacted Mrs Worrall’s dad and she, together with his partner, Lorraine, entered Nicola’s flat where they found her body.

A note addressed to 'Dad and Lorraine' was found as well as an A4 notepad open on her bed with detailed handwritten notes about how to hang herself.

Coroner Alan Wilson concluded Mrs Worrall took her own life and said: 'Clearly Nicola has had a troubled life as far as her health was concerned, starting I’m sure with the death of her mother when she was only 13.

'She started a career in teaching but appears to have struggled to cope and eventually left that and went into the health service.

'She met and married David and they had a child but the relationship deteriorated. She was a perfectionist and conscientious, maybe she was hoping to get by on her own steam.

'There became a time when she broke down, her child had been placed with his father..Things were spiralling downwards it would seem, until she was found at the flat.

'While it clearly came as a shock it was not the greatest surprise.'
