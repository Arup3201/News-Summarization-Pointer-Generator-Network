This September, the Prada SS15 show was one of the most talked about of Milan Fashion Week. 

But Miuccia Prada's new designs aren't the only thing to have got the clothes industry talking - the addition of 14-year-old model Roos Abels on the catwalk also raised several immaculately-plucked eyebrows. 

The decision to include the Dutch teenager in the show has reignited the debate about how what age models need to be in order to take part in these events.

Miuccia has a long history of using young models in both her catwalks and campaigns - she is responsible for kick-starting the careers of several unknown teens after casting them in her projects. 

The actress Hailee Steinfeld appeared in a Miu Miu campaign aged just 14 back in 2011, which was subsequently banned by the Advertising Standards Agency. 

American model Lyndsey Wixon was photographed for another Miu Miu campaign when she was just 15, and Kelly Mittendorf, Antonia Wesseloh, and Ondria Hardin were all 16 when they modeled for the Prada 2011 AW adverts. 

But since those days, several rules have been implemented in the fashion industry to prevent young models being used. 

The Prada show is considered one of the biggest and most popular of Milan Fashion Week 

In 2011, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) put a ban on any models under the age of 16 appearing on the catwalk at Fashion Week shows. 

The guidelines were taken so seriously that models showing up to walk the runways were often asked to bring ID to prove they were of working age. 

According to the Telegraph, in London there are no specific rules for model ages at Fashion Week, but all members of the Association Of Model Agents have  agreed not to sign any of their models under 16 years old up for these catwalk shows.

In an open letter to the fashion industry in 2011, CFDA  President Diane von Furstenberg summed up the argument for only using models over the age of 16 in catwalk shows.

She said: 'The industry’s hiring of prepubescent-appearing teenage girls as models of adult clothing sets an unrealistic standard; hips and breasts, the curves that define the female figure, are absent.

'Some models have difficulty maintaining the body ideal as they move into adulthood and run the risk of engaging in unhealthy eating behaviors that lead to eating disorders.' 

MailOnline has contacted Prada for a comment.
