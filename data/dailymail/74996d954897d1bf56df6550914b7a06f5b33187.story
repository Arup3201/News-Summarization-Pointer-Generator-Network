There can be few more startling examples of gentrification than New York’s Meatpacking District.

In 1900 it was home to 250 abattoirs and packing plants – hence the name – in the 1980s it was a magnet for drug dealers and the Mafia – and now it’s one of the trendiest areas anywhere in the world, frequented by fashionistas, cocktail scenesters and more hipsters than you can shake a mojito at, not to mention handfuls of Manhattan’s celebrity population.

They are drawn to high-end boutiques like Christian Louboutin, dining hot-spots such as Pastis and the hotel I’m staying at – the Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC.

Hot spot: The Gansevoort is in the heart of the trendy Meatpacking district

It opened in 2004, with the likes of the Kardashians, Rihanna, Christina Aguilera, Sofia Vergara and Zoe Saldana all having checked in there since.

I may not be a celebrity, but the staff there still treat you like one. Okay, they don’t ask for my autograph, but Mother Thornhill, my travelling companion, and I are treated with the utmost courtesy by the staff behind the reception desk and the bell boy gives us an enthusiastic tour of our ‘Deluxe’ roost.

Cynics might say he’s angling for a big tip, but he seems sincere to me.

In the room, my eye is immediately caught by a substantial-looking boom box, which connects to your phone and any playlists you have on it via Bluetooth. Further exploration reveals a mini-bar fit for a pop star, with Grey Goose vodka and Veuve Clicqout champagne.

The beds, meanwhile, are seriously sizeable, and look incredibly comfortable. I throw myself onto mine. It is indeed worthy of the ‘deluxe’ nomenclature. The hotel’s website boasts that the linen is 400-thread Egyptian cotton, which I’m assuming is a mark of quality, judging by how tremendous they are to lie on.

Comfort zone: The Gansevoort's bedrooms are spacious, stylish and luxurious

The headboards above them are a striking pink, which some might not find relaxing, but with the lights out, who cares? The bathroom is large, marbly, spotless, and festooned with luxe Cutler washing products. Half the space is covered by mirrors – I wouldn’t expect anything less given the hotel’s paparazzi-baiting clientele.

There’s acres of space in the room, so you can really spread out. And plenty of light.

Most hotels of note like to throw some art on the walls, and the Gansevoort is no different. We have a photograph of a woman with long hair, plus a photograph of a man and woman moving in for a kiss that’s presented in two separate frames. Very arty. Not to my taste, but a hat tip to the hotel for making the effort.

All in all it’s a seductive environment – contemporary, a bit flash, but comfortable and welcoming.

A good place to get your bearings at the Gansevoort is to ascend to the rooftop bar where you’ll find a big swimming pool and superb views over the Meatpacking District.

I sip a cold sauvignon blanc and cast an eye over the neighbourhood. Right opposite is the lauded Pastis restaurant, a bit further beyond that is the revered High Line – a disused elevated railway that’s been transformed into a hipster’s nature reserve with pop-up bars and ice-cream stalls – and straight down below are the deeply uneven cobbled streets that swarms of taxis bounce along day and night.

The fact that achingly fashionable media members club Soho House opened its New York branch here – just yards to the north-east, says it all. It’s a buzz zone that’s taken root.

Much of the character of the Gansevoort Meatpacking is expressed in one fell swoop by the lobby. It’s expansive, airy, modern – and there’s a pool table. Trendy, but not uptight. It’s catwalk hipster every step of the way.

The very cool Lobby Bar is the focal point, though. I recommend the Newton, Napa Valley, chardonnay they serve, but apparently the most popular tipple is a cocktail called ‘The District’ – made with ketel citroen, pomegranate syrup and lime juice.

The outdoor section of the hotel’s restaurant, The Chester, meanwhile, is a superb place to not only dine on thoroughly decent fodder, but to soak up the vibrant Meatpacking atmosphere.

Options include prime juicy steak, campanelle pasta tossed with mushrooms and broccoli and Atlantic salmon topped with bourbon glaze. It’s uncomplicated fare, cooked well, and always whisked out from the kitchen with friendly efficiency.

Any hotel setting up shop in Meatpacking needs to have measures in place to shield its residents from the sounds of nighttime revelry. New York in general is noisy, but this district harbours a cluster of hotspots open till the early hours.

Gansevoort just about succeeds. The beds prove to be monumentally comfortable, while solid double glazing tempers the sounds of the night right down. However, booking in here comes with the caveat that if you’re a very light sleeper, you may not get the most restful night. I’m stirred a couple of times by excitable hollering from the bar opposite our fourth-floor room – called Catch - but only briefly.

I find that I like the hotel best in the morning. We establish a glorious routine of going for a swim in the rooftop pool and lounging in the brilliant oversized wicker chairs as the sunlight reaches out to us across the skyline.

Then it’s downstairs for coffee, juice and eggs benedict outside at the Chester to watch Meatpacking come to life.

I’m sad to say goodbye to the Gansevoort. It’s a hotel that has cleverly alchemised swagger, style and luxury with a welcoming atmosphere.

No wonder the celebrities risk breaking their heels on Meatpacking’s cobbles to stay here.
