This Indian takeaway does great wings - but the decor’s a bit plane.

A teenage curry house owner has spent £5,000 on a second-hand aircraft fuselage which was used in The Da Vinci Code, to display in his reception.

But 18-year-old Aleem Gaffer’s plan to spruce up his restaurant backfired when he realised he could not get it inside.

Plane crazy: Alim Adbul, 18, had to get his friends to help get the two tonne fuselage into his takeaway in Bristol. It cost him £5,000

He had to remove the front of the shop and, with a team of six friends, slide the two tonne Hawker jet flight deck into the Indian takeaway in Filton, Bristol.

Aleem wants to decorate the fuselage and use it as a seating area for customers to wait in while their food is prepared.

The young businessman bought the jet as a gift for his aircraft-loving father and to grab the attention of staff at the nearby Airbus factory.

Tight squeeze: Aleem Gaffer, 18, bought the unusual £5,000 shop display to impress his father Abdul, 28, who is a big fan of planes

Glass removed: The window of the restaurant in Bristol is taken out to get the fuselage inside

He said: 'Airbus employs thousands of staff nearby and many of them have to pass my takeaway each day so I thought attract more business.

'I didn’t do the measurements but I was confident it would fit, now we will have to get it in - I hope everything will be sorted over the next month.

'The idea is for people to sit inside the fuselage and admire it while they wait for their food.

Tight squeeze: Friends of Alim Abdul use a rope as they attempt to haul the front of the plane - used in The Da Vinci Code - into the curry house

'People walking past have been a bit shocked but it is something different for the area, hopefully everyone will like it.

'My father loves planes as well so I thought it would be a nice surprise for him. He’s really pleased.'

Aleem, who has worked in the Bristol takeaway since he was 12, took over the business from his father, Bangladesh-born Abdul, 38, last year.

The plane is a Hawker 800XP.

Abdul added: 'It was very surprising when Aleem told me to come downstairs and look outside as I didn’t expect to find a plane.

'I love planes so it is a perfect gift and it is going to look great in the shop. It is amazing.'
