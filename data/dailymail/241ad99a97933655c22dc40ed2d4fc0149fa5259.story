The Chicago air traffic control center that was disabled by a former employee setting fire to it reopened early Monday morning after weeks of disrupted air travel nationwide.

A full team of air traffic controllers returned to work around 1 a.m. at the En Route Center in Aurora, bringing back control capacity from nearby air traffic centers. 

Around 200 employees from Aurora had been working at other FAA control centers to monitor flights since September 26, FAA officials said in a statement. 

Up: FAA controllers returned to En Route Center in Aurora, taking control of Chicago airports from nearby centers who had been lending control capacity

In earlier statements, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta had stated it would take at least until October 13 to get the center running normally again.

Chicago's two main airports, O'Hare and Midway, struggled in the weeks since the fire to return flight capacity to normal.

On October 1, O'Hare was still struggling to reach 85 percent capacity for scheduled flights while Midway was up just over 80 percent.

Brian Howard, 36, was charged with felony destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities after he cut cables and set a fire in the basement of the air traffic control center before trying to take his life.

The paramedics and firefighters who responded to smoke coming from the fire discovered blood pooled on the floor of the basement, according to the complaint filed in federal court.

Canceled: Passengers became stranded at O'Hare and Midway after flights were canceled due to the fire set in the Aurora control center

Delayed: Passengers waited for any available flights out of Chicago as other air traffic control centers took over for Aurora, though airports were only running at 85 percent  their normal capacity as of October 1

Following the trail of blood, emergency responders discovered wires had been sabotaged and, a little farther on, found Howard shirtless under a table with knife wounds on his arms.

Accused: Paramedics found Brian Howard, 36, under a table in the basement of the En Route Center in Aurora moments as he tried to kill himself

Paramedics said that when they discovered him, Howard was in the process of trying to slit his throat and told emergency officials: 'leave me alone.' 

Ron Safer, Howard's lawyer, has said that Howard made a 'tragic mistake.'

A FAA technical team will remain in Aurora until Tuesday to supervise the transition 

The agency drew fire from officials, including Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, for its handling of the incident.

Emmanuel held a press conference sharply criticizing the agency for not being able to restore service to O'Hare, a central hub for air traffic, and the FAA is conducting a 30-day review of their contingency and security plans at major facilities.

The fire also brought to light how antiquated air traffic infrastructure in the U.S. had become. 

Huerta has said that with the $37billion overhaul of the nation's air traffic control systems now being implemented, the FAA 'will have the ability to configure any single facility to view any part of our nation’s airspace.'

As of Monday morning, flights were moving much smoother than travelers had become used to in Chicago. 

Charged: Howard's lawyer, Ron Safer, said his client had made a 'tragic mistake' during his suicide attempt, adding that his client regrets having 'inconvenienced many many people'

Only two flights at O'Hare had been canceled as of 9 a.m., putting the Chicago airport ahead of Boston and Newark's international airports.
