The White House suggested Friday that President Barack Obama was trying to work out his tensions when he played 18 holes of golf on Wednesday – complete with grins and fist-bumps – immediately after delivering a brief but moving speech condemning the gruesome execution of American photojournalist James Foley.

And adding to the week of optics problems, Secretary of State John Kerry was spotted sailing off the island of Nantucket while the Pentagon and White House answered tough questions about the Middle East.

'Sports and leisure activities are a good way for release and clearing of the mind for a lot of us,' Deputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters in a makeshift briefing room on Martha's Vineyard, where Obama is on a two-week vacation.

But 'I am not going to get into the president's mindset on that,' he added.

The president drew fire this week after reacting for just five minutes to Foley's on-camera slaying by Islamist militants linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), and then gripping his driver for five hours.

The fist-bump: Less than ten minutes after delivering heartfelt words about the vicious killing of James Foley, Obama hit the links with friends

Less than ten minutes before teeing off, he had told a global audience that 'when people harm Americans, anywhere, we do what’s necessary to see that justice is done.'

Then he was seen laughing with friends at the Farm Neck Golf Club. A day later he played golf again, although photographs taken Thursday depicted a more somber commander-in-chief recreating. 

Obama took first lady Michelle Obama hiking on Friday morning. Reporters and photographers were kept far out of range. 

Schultz acknowledged Friday the poor 'optics' of playing golf while a decapitated journalist's family mourned, but insisted that 'the president is focused on doing his job,' even while on vacation.

'Just because the president is in a different location doesn't mean he's not doing his job,' Schultz insisted, assuring reporters that domestic and international events have 'absolutely captured the president's attention while we've been here.'

Donald Trump, the ubiquitous real estate mogul and golf course owner, told MailOnline that the White House should be taking advantage of Obama's golf outings as a chance to build compromises with Republicans.

Golf 'is a perfect game to make friends and negotiate deals over,' he said Friday.

But 'the only people Obama should be playing golf with are congressmen – legislators – and especially the opposition.'

'Obama should not be playing golf on the first day of bombings or after an American journalist is beheaded.'

A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told MailOnline that to his knowledge, the senior Republican lawmaker had never been invited to play a round with the president.

Kerry hasn't been seen in Washington all week, and reporters have been unable to get an answer from the State Department about his location.

But Instagram user Judy Durkin posted a photo of a sailboat on Monday that bears the same markings as Kerry's, cruising neat Nantucket – just a few miles from where Obama has been vacationing.

Others tweeted Kerry sightings there as recently as Thursday.

The Republican National Committee, predictably, was not amused.

'The Obama White House is MIA on the world stage,' RNC Deputy Press Secretary Raffi Williams told MailOnline. 'America’s influence around the world has been waning ever since Obama took office and now that the world is erupting in crises our top diplomat is sailing in Nantucket.'

'Americans want hands on leadership that tackles the tough problems head on. The out of touch leadership seen from Obama and Kerry is going to hurt 2014 Democrats.'

The State Department released a statement in Kerry's name on Wednesday, after the Foley video had made most of America cringe.

'We grieve for James Foley. We mourn for his family and his loved ones,' the statement read. 'We honor the courage and pray for the safety of all those who risk their lives to discover the truth where it is needed most.'

'And make no mistake: we will continue to confront ISI[S] wherever it tries to spread its despicable hatred. The world must know that the United States of America will never back down in the face of such evil.'

Criticism of the president after he marked his scorecard Wednesday was fast and furious.

'Not only did he insult the Foley family; he sent a message to [ISIS leader] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and all of the other jihadi terrorist militants – now soldiers of a jihadi army – that he doesn't take it all seriously.'

Texas Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert told Mailonline that Obama's detached attitude suggests he hasn't been engaged in the hunt for Foley's murderer.

'Unfortunately for those who want evil ISIS members eliminated before they kill more Americans,' Gohmert said, 'the president spent more time lining up his many putts than he did lining up efforts to stop the killers.'

Lou Barletta, a Republican lawmaker from Pennsylvania, told MailOnline that the image of Obama golfing his cares away 'is disheartening, and sends the wrong signals to our enemies. ISIS needs to be stopped, and fist pumps between the president and his buddies won’t stop them.'

Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney told Fox News host Sean Hannity that 'every day we find new evidence that he’d rather be on the golf course than he would be dealing with a crisis that’s developing rapidly in the Middle East.'

ABC News political director Rick Klein added that 'the president himself clearly doesn't ... care about the way it looks.'

19 hours and off he goes: UK Prime Minister David Cameron made a brief stop at No. 10 to talk about James Foley before heading back to Cornwall for body-surfing

Obama's golf game found a parallel in the UK on Friday, as Prime Minister David Cameron returned to his own beach vacation just 19 hours after returning to No. 10 Downing Street to be briefed on the ISIS execution and deliver some brief comments.

Cameron was photographed body-boarding through waves in Cornwall in a three quarter-length wet suit.

Foley's killer spoke with a British accent on a video that ISIS released on Tuesday. Some former captives of the group believed to have held Foley for two years have said a three-man cell of UK terrorists were known to them as 'The Beatles.'

A furious effort is underway – but without Cameron in his office – to identify the executioner, known now as 'Jihad John.'

Government sources have insisted that the prime minister remains in full touch with Whitehall during his holiday, with a secure phone line set up for his use.

Labour MP Ann Clwyd, the former British human rights envoy to Iraq, said it was 'extraordinary that he has gone off on holiday again after a few hours back in London – it is just not good enough.'

'If he is serious about the threat to Britain, as he says he is and as he ought to be, then he should not be pushing off on holiday. He should be recalling MPs to Parliament so that we can discuss the situation and debate our response.'
