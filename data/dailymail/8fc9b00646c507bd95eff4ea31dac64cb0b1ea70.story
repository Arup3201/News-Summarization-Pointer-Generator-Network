The Vatican has called on spectators at Sunday's World Cup final to 'pause for peace' before the game, while continuing to play down rivalries between Pope Francis and his predecessor.

A senior Vatican official asked football fans to take a moment before the final game at the Maracana stadium to remember those affected by war and poverty.

The official also sought to play down 'amusing' rumours of rivalry between Argentine Pope Francis and Pope Emeritus Benedict, a German, saying the two had not decided how to spend Sunday night.

Pope Francis, left, and his predecessor Pope Benedict, right, from Argentina and Germany respectively, have announced that they do not plan to take sides during Sunday's World Cup Final between their native countries 

Benedict, the source pointed out, is not a football fan, but added: "Let's see. The current situation is unique".

The
 Vatican's spokesman said he did not believe Benedict, now 87 and living
 his retirement in seclusion in an ex-convent in the Vatican, would 
watch the match, because of the late hour

Francis,
 on the other hand, is most definitely a football fan having been a keen
 supporter of San Lorenzo while archbishop of Buenos Aires.

He
 is an honorary member of the club nicknamed the Saints of Boedo for the
 neighborhood where they were founded by a group of young men that 
included a priest in 1908.

The
 Vatican's Council for Culture called the pre-match speculation 'amusing
 and entertaining"'but said it was calling for a moment of silence on 
Sunday for 'thinking about important things'.

'Let's
 have a pause for peace,' said Monsignor Melcher Sanchez de Tosca y 
Alameda, the council's undersecretary, announcing a social media hashtag
 #PAUSEforPeace.

Sanchez referred to the tradition in ancient Greece to stop all conflicts during the Olympic games.

Pope Francis wished all teams good luck at the start of the World Cup tournament which ends on Sunday 

Pope Francis, right, has no plans to invite his predecessor, Pope Benedict, left around for Sunday's game

'Why not for the World Cup? Why not a pause, a moment of silence, a truce for peace?' he said.

A
 spokesman for the council said it would be up to each fan, each team 
and each organization, including soccer governing body FIFA, if, how and
 when they wanted to observe a moment of 'silence or reflection or 
pause' to remember those suffering.

Germany
 are hotly tipped to win the tournament in Brazil after demolishing the 
hosts 7-1 in their semi-final this week, scoring three goals in just 76 
seconds and inflicting the heaviest defeat in Brazilian footballing 
history.

Argentina reached the final when a dull 0-0 draw with the Netherlands after extra time saw them win 4-2 on penalties.

Argentine fans are convinced that Pope Francis is on their side and have even special papal masks - even though the Pontiff has repeatedly said that he will not be praying for his native Argentina during the tournament
