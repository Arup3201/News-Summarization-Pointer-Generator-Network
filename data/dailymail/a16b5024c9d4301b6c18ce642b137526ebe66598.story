She may have missed out on the British Style Award, voted for by the public, to Harry Styles this year but Alexa Chung is clearly keen to prove she's still an icon if her latest beauty campaign is anything to go by.

The 30-year-old, who has created a 
line of limited edition eye make-up sets, showcases her new range as she poses as a Sixties siren in her latest campaign for the brand.

Dressed in a pink polo neck jumper, Alexa wears her hair in a low bun with her fringe pulled to the side to display her trademark feline flick.

Speaking in a how-to video about achieving her look at home, she says: 'For ages my make-up was really minimal because I was modelling as a teenager and the brief for models is that you attend castings with a bare face so I hadn't developed any skills at make-up at all.

'And then I started doing TV so I had a make-up artist at the time who suggested things that I could do.

'I think one day we tried the 60s retro inspired cat's eye look and I was like: "Ah I feel like me in this!"'.

The star has created a thick nib eyeliner and a 
mascara so that beauty aficionados can re-create her signature feline flick
 eyes.

She said: 'This is a felt tip pen and I am used to drawing and illustrating so I think of my face as another canvas or a piece of paper.

'So I draw the flick first and then I match it on the other side, I use my bottom lash line as a guide and it should be a continuation of that and then I fill it in.

'I think the perfect compliment to a cat eye is to have a full lash, both top and bottom.'

And it seems that everyone wants to get the Alexa look -  her debut make-up 
collection for Eyeko completely sold out in Selfridges on launch day. In fact, such was the crowd she drew that the store was on the brink of closing because of safety issues.
