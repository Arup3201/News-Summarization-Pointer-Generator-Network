Cutbacks: Lloyds Chief-Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said that 15,000 jobs will go

Lloyds announced that 15,000 jobs will be axed over the next three years to save £1.5billion a year.

The huge cull will take job losses to more than 40,000 since Lloyds TSB merged with HBOS in 2009.

However, despite the drastic cost-cutting measures the bank claimed not a single extra branch will close.

New chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio revealed the cutbacks today as part of his strategic review of the taxpayer-backed lender.

No UK bank has ever shed no many jobs in corporate history. All of the jobs will go by the end of 2014.

The chief executive said the majority of the the positions set to be axed are at managerial level with hundreds expected to go from the London head office.

Branch staff are expected to be largely unaffected as the posts go by the end of 2014.

Lloyds will also look to use natural staff attrition and internal redeployment rather than redundancy where possible.

However, the Unite union said the review will cause 'deep distress and anxiety' across the company.

David Fleming, Unite national officer, added: 'Astonishingly one in eight roles will be lost over the next three years.

'This review is merely another box-ticking exercise to give this bank - which has already, since its creation two years ago, cut over 27,000 staff - an excuse to sack more employees.'

Mr Horta-Osorio, the Portuguese-born 
banker who took the top post in March after being poached from rival 
Santander, also announced plans to reduce the company's international 
presence from 30 countries to less than half that number by 2014.

He also pledged to revitalise the Halifax brand.

Massive job losses: Cull of 40,000 at Lloyds is the biggest round of cuts at a UK bank in corporate history. The majority of the latest round of job losses will be at managerial level

Lloyds Banking Group unveiled Mr Horta-Osorio as its new chief executive in November last year. He joined as executive director in January and started the job in March.

He became chief executive of Santander-owned Abbey in 2006, which was later rebranded as Santander UK.

During his time at Santander UK, he snapped up Alliance & Leicester for £1.26 billion, Bradford & Bingley's savings book and 197 branches for £612 million and 318 branches from Royal Bank of Scotland.

When the businesses all came together under the Santander UK brand at the beginning of the year, it became the UK's third biggest bank - with a customer base of 26 million and more than 1,300 branches.

Banking giant HSBC also announced today they will cut 700 jobs across the UK as it prepares for a drop in demand for financial advice due to upcoming changes in the law.

The company is reshaping its wealth management business before Retail Distribution Review rules are introduced in January 2013.

The new law will mean UK banks can no longer offer financial advice for free, so HSBC expects demand for the service to decline. However, the bank will still have 1,500 advisers across the UK.

The blow to staff comes on the day Lloyds Banking Group announced 15,000 job cuts by 2014.

Lloyds Banking Group has already cut 27,500 jobs since it was formed less than three years ago.

The part-nationalised lender, formed in January 2009 from the merger of HBOS and Lloyds TSB, has cut jobs across the business - from motor finance to insurance and from IT to wholesale banking, as well as closing a number of call centres.Since January 2009 the lender has repeatedly unveiled plans to axe jobs - although today's announcement is the largest so far.
