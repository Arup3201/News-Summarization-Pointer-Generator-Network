Just over one year ago, Pattaramon Chanbua was a mother-of-two living with her grandparents and working in a food stall at the front of their home.

But the 21-year-old from Chon Buri - a province about 80km south of Bangkok - now finds herself the face of an international row over the legality and ethics of the business of surrogacy in Thailand after it was revealed she was a surrogate for an Australian couple who allegedly abandoned one of the babies when they returned home.

Ms Pattaramon claims David and Wendy Farnell, from Bunbury in Western Australia, did not want seven-month-old baby Gammy when they found he had Down syndrome and took only his twin sister.

Her Facebook account also reveals more about her life - dozens of selfies taken alongside her family, including her husband and Gammy - and what appears to be messages suggesting she was trying to scout for other surrogate mothers.

It has since emerged David Farnell is a convicted paedophile after he was jailed for 22 child sex offences. But his son has defended his father, telling The Sydney Morning Herald that it was 'heartbreaking' his father's dark past was being revisited.

Previous media reports suggested the Farnells' chosen surrogate, Pattaramon Chanbua, lived in an impoverished Thai village, but Ms Pattaramon actually rents and lives in a unit complex in an industrial area in Chon Buri.

Her grandparents live at the food stall, which is nearby, and Ms Pattaramon works a few days per month - where she cooks and cleans with her grandmother - but rents a unit in the complex with her husband for 2,200 baht per month, which equates to $74.

My Pattaramon was paid a total of $16,000 by the Australian couple to give birth to the baby. Her grandparents's stall where she works occasionally makes roughly $300 a month.

The unit is basic with one bedroom and one bathroom, but it is her own place and a step up from the home she was sharing with her grandparents, husband and two children.

Now Ms Pattaramon's two eldest children live with her part of the time, but also stay with her grandparents often.

Neighbours said Ms Pattaramon grew up at her grandparents' home and the family has been living there for about 20 years. The house is locked by a metal front gate but no door.

Neighbours say they have not seen anyone go into the house since Gammy was admitted to hospital more than a week ago.

They told the Daily Mail Australia they believed her grandmother was with her at nearby Samitivej Sriracha Hospital where Gammy is receiving treatment for pneumonia.

They were unsure where her eldest children were staying, but they have been seen at the hospital and also with Ms Pattaramon visiting her unit.

A small dog sits out the front of the stall next to a bowl filled with water and another half-filled with rice, but it is unclear who is feeding it.

At the front of the house are tables with baskets filled with plates, glasses and pots for cooking.

There is also a gas bottle stove and bottles of condiments to go with the Thai salads the stall normally serves, which cost between 30 and 40 baht ($1 to $1.30).

A table for serving, topped with a green umbrella, sits to the left of the house's facade.

For 2,200 baht a month, the unit would have one bedroom and one bathroom

Ms Pattaramon's landlord at the unit complex, who wished to remain anonymous, told Daily Mail Australia she had moved in just over a year ago

Ms Pattaramon's landlord at the unit complex, who wished to remain anonymous, told Daily Mail Australia she had moved in just over a year ago.

'Probably she was already pregnant when she moved in, it was just not very obvious,' she said, speaking through a translator.

Since Gammy was admitted to hospital she has been back to visit every few days to pick up clothing and belongings. Sometimes she brings her two eldest children with her.

The landlord also said that during her pregnancy she seemed to have more money, and would buy a lot of handbags and accessories.

During her pregnancy, Ms Pattaramon also told her landlord that when she gave birth she was going to give the baby to her 'sister', who had a foreign acquaintance that could not conceive children.

Neighbours on the street where her grandparents own a food stall also said she appeared to have more money when she became pregnant, but kept quiet about the details of her pregnancy.

Jumpol, who owns a barber shop on the street, said Ms Pattaramon started wearing expensive new clothes and handbags.

The 49-year-old added Ms Pattaramon's husband worked in a company in Sriracha, but he did not believe he was the father of her eldest children.

Jumpol also said Ms Pattaramon only worked at the stall a few days per month.

Other neighbours, who did not wish to be named, also said when she was pregnant she was buying more accessories such as 'gold chains'.

Neighbour Kai, who runs a small convenience store on the street, said Ms Pattaramon was not very social with people on the street.

The 42-year-old told Daily Mail Australia Ms Pattaramon worked sometimes at the stall selling salad and other Thai dishes, mainly to students who lived in a nearby dormitory.

She added the stall would make about 9,000 or 10,000 baht per month ($300 to $334 per month).

This comes after posts found on Ms Chanbua's Facebook suggested she was trying to solicit women for egg donation and surrogacy.

The posts were made on FacebookÂ  in April and May this year, but have since been deleted.

'Job available egg donation meeting the client tomorrow we need people who are with the age between 20 to 27 with height more than 160cm with weight not more than 60 kg with blood group A and the payment rate will be 20,000 to 50,000 baht cash [$668 to $1670],' she wrote on May 16.

On April 25, Ms Pattaramon wrote: 'Right now we are looking for a great number of good-hearted mothers from Bangkok as well as other provinces. If you are interested, we can talk.'

And on May 16 she wrote: 'Job available for women with blood group A who are tall, nice looking egg donation very urgent.'

Thai media also reported that in one Facebook post Ms Chanbua wrote: 'For people who are interested in a surrogation job please fill in the following message accordingly: first name nickname blood type age date of birth nationality height weight eye colour hair colour facial form education hobbies and send seven to eight pictures.'

Since David and Wendy Farnell were identified as the biological parents of baby Gammy on Tuesday, Western Australia's Department of Child Protection have been seeking them for a meeting.

A spokeswoman for the department's minister said officials had got in touch with the couple on Thursday, but she did not confirm if they had met in person or spoken over the phone.

The adult son of Farnell, a convicted paedophile, defended his father, who has been convicted of 22 child sex offences

Also on Thursday, the son of Farnell, a convicted paedophile, defended his father, who has been convicted of 22 child sex offences.

'He's taken 10 years to get his life back on track and he did and he has done so well and this, this has been shattering,' the unnamed son was quoted as saying in the Sydney Morning Herald.

'I can tell you how good of a father my dad was towards us. He's amazing,' the unnamed son was quoted saying.

'He's brought out the best in all us kids. He's just got a massive heart. He's made mistakes, we've accepted it... he's made up for them.'

His comments came after it was revealed Farnell was convicted of 22 child sex offences, including one against a girl who was just seven. The sentencing judge said the victims had been 'robbed of their childhood'.

It had earlier been reported that David John Farnell, now 56, had been sentenced to three years' jail in 1997 for sexually molesting two girls under the age of 13 and that months later, while still in prison, he was charged again, this time with six counts of indecent dealing with a child under the age of 13.

But further court documents have revealed other sex offences, bringing the total number of convictions against him to 22 - including a victim aged just seven.
