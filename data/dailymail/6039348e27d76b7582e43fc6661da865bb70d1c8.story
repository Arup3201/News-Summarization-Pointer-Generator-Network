Officials in a popular resort city in New Jersey are considering rules that would require visitors to pull up their pants, wear a shirt and don a pair of shoes while strolling the town's boardwalk.

Wildwood, popular with holiday-makers from surrounding areas during the summer months, has a family-friendly appeal, and the city's officials want to keep it that way.

Mayor Ernie Troiano Jr told Press of Atlantic City, 'I'm sick of hearing people complain 
about the disrespectful individuals who walk around with their butts 
hanging out.'

Visitors to the boardwalk in Wildwood, New Jersey, may soon be subject to dress regulations, including pants no lower than three inches below the waistline

The proposed rules are contained in a new
city ordinance, up for a public hearing June 12, titled 'Establishing 
decency standards on the public Boardwalk'.

Under the regulations, the waistband of pants, shorts, swimsuits, and skirts can be no lower than three inches below the waist to prevent the exposure of skin or underwear.

Other regulations require shirts to be worn between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m, and shoes that 'adequately protect one's feet from wood or nails protruding from the surface of the boardwalk must be worn at all times'.

Mayor Troiano Jr said the shoe requirement was a safety issue, while the clothing rules reflect the town's values and the image it wants to project.

'I know the social climate's changed and what people think is decent is different than it was,' Troiano said.

Wearing pants low, often belted well below the hip, is a fashion popular among young skaters, who may soon be forced to pull up their pants in Wildwood, New Jersey

Commissioner Peter Byron said he supported the ordinance in its current form.

'I think it's obnoxious with these kids who wear their pants down around their knees,' Byron said, adding he sometimes receives complaints from people unhappy with the style of dress.

Other towns such as Cape May and Ocean City have some regulation in place regarding clothing on their respective promenade and boardwalk.

Meanwhile, laws similar to Wildwood's proposed ordinance have been enacted in communities around the country, including Terrebone Parish, Louisiana, and Cocoa, Florida.

A public hearing on the ordinance is scheduled for June 12 at City Hall.
