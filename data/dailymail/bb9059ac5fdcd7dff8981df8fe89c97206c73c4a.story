England's Jack Wilshere can tap into advice from the greatest footballer in history after becoming the first client of a new sports agency in which Pele is a partner.

Wilshere wears the No 10 shirt at Arsenal — the same as the Brazil legend — which helps explain why the sports management agency is called 10Ten Talent.

The business has been formed by Terry Byrne, a former personal manager of David Beckham who also heads the England players’ representative business 1966.

Byrne works with former Spurs director Paul Kemsley, who manages Pele’s commercial rights business. He said: ‘Obviously Jack can’t be mentioned as being anywhere near the same league as Pele, but hopefully one day he will.’

Byrne, who has assured both the FA and the players that there will be no conflict with his 1966 duties, has also signed up former England manager Glenn Hoddle. The two have maintained links since they were both at Chelsea.

England and Wasps rugby wing Christian Wade is also joining 10Ten, which doesn’t want to concentrate solely on football.

UEFA chief executive Gianni Infantino somehow claims the qualifying process for an enlarged Euro 2016 with 24 clubs is more ‘interesting’ and has created a ‘whole new dynamic with some amazing results’. It would be difficult to find anyone not wearing a UEFA blazer who would agree with Infantino after watching last night’s San Marino debacle.

British swimming chief David Sparkes created a splash last year when he told Sportsmail that Tom Daley was in danger of putting the cart before the horse with his commercial and media activities, which his Chinese rivals would never do.

But Daley now says he has a ‘really good relationship’ with Sparkes, whom he credits with helping his move to London and training in the Olympic Park’s Aquatics Centre as well as setting up the Daley diving academies. Tom says he’s training five hours a day, six days a week for his gold-medal bid in Rio.

The Football League’s revamp of their commercial operation since Richard Heaselgrave’s exit has seen the appointment as a director of the well-regarded Ben Wright. He has left sports agency WMG to return to football after previous roles at Spurs and the FA. The new marketing director Drew Barrand joins from sports marketing agency Pitch.

United in FFP spotlight

The Financial Fair Play battleground in the Premier League is likely to become considerably more messy after a special summit at UEFA’s headquarters in Nyon on Monday.

Clubs with huge debts such as Manchester United might find themselves under the microscope during the next stage of FFP, which is due to be discussed at the meeting.

UEFA president Michel Platini has gathered all those involved in FFP — including Manchester City, who have had £50m worth of sanctions imposed for their overspending — to talk about how to refine the controversial legislation.

UEFA chief Gianni Infantino has confirmed that the issue of debt is expected to be raised again

UEFA chief executive Gianni Infantino confirmed at Leaders in Sport that the debt issue may be on the agenda next week and the European Clubs Association also say they expect it to be raised.

Manchester City will stress their zero-debt status and push the case for sustainable investment spending rather than try to shift the spotlight on to their Manchester neighbours, who still owe £350m from the Glazer family’s leveraged purchase of the club.

Nevertheless City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak did highlight the differences between the two clubs when he pointedly said: ‘We have a sustainable project. We have zero debt. We don’t pay a penny to service any debt.’

FA chairman Greg Dyke has been ordered to return a watch given to him by Brazil's Football Federation

FA chairman Greg Dyke may not have taken his £16,400 watch, one of 65 given by the Brazilian football federation to delegates at the FIFA congress in Sao Paulo last June, out of its packaging.

]But the Parmigiani timepiece, which the FIFA ethics committee have ordered to be returned by October 24, continues to cause Dyke hassle. 

He is currently negotiating with British customs over whether he must pay import duty on the watch.
