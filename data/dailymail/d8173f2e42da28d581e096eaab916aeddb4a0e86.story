Search continues: Portuguese police are understood to have received information from an informant about a Madeleine McCann lookalike spotted in the town of Nerja near Malaga in Spain

The Madeleine McCann mystery took a new twist today as it emerged that Spanish police are looking for the missing girl in a Costa del Sol holiday resort

Detectives are making inquiries in Nerja after a tip-off from colleagues in Portugal.

Portuguese police are understood to have received information from an informant about a Madeleine McCann lookalike spotted in the town near Malaga.

Officers from a specialist unit are said to have been mobilised after being sent details of the sighting.

The development is thought to be connected to a new review of Madeleine McCann's disappearance.

A new squad of officers has been brought in to re-examine the case.

The team, from the northern city of 
Porto, has been instructed to go over the thousands of pages of case 
files and search for new clues.

The officers are working with a Scotland
Yard team set up in May last year to review the investigation into 
Madeleine's May 2007 disappearance from the Algarve resort of Praia da 
Luz.

Respected Malaga-based daily Diario Sur 
said the fresh inquiries in Spain were being carried out by officers 
from the Judicial Police's Central Specialised and Violent Crime Unit.

Officers from the specialist police division are currently searching for two siblings who disappeared in a park in 
Cordoba, southern Spain on October 8.

The youngsters' dad Jose Breton was arrested over their disappearance and is being held in prison.

Police have failed to find any trace of 
Ruth, six, and Jose, two, despite several searches of a family home with
radar equipment.

The McCanns' Portuguese lawyer Rogerio Alves has described the Portuguese police case review as a 'very postive sign'.

He said when news emerged of the 
creation of the new team: 'Obviously the most plausible explanation for 
what's happening is that information passed to or acquired by the 
Judicial Police in Porto has put them on the trail of something 
specific.'
