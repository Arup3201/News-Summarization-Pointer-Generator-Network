From the Grand Canyon to the Great Barrier Reef, Google Street View lets you visit some of the world’s most famous landmarks – and impressive holiday destinations – from your sofa.

Now you can take a tour of the world’s largest cruise liner, including its ice skating rink, surfing simulator and lavish shopping street, which even boasts a merry-go-round.

Royal Caribbean International’s Allure of the Seas measures 1,184ft long and weighs 222,900 tonnes. It is designed to take people on a tour of the Mediterranean in style.

The ship can carry 5,400 passengers as well as crew to staff the many restaurants and leisure attractions squeezed on board.

Royal Caribbean has teamed up with Google Maps Business View – the commercial arm of Street View – so that people can take a virtual tour of the mammoth vessel, even if it is more limited than a conventional Street View experience.

The tour comprises main features of the ship including 'ship neighbourhoods' such as the Sun Deck and Central Park and 'unique activities' including a 200ft rock wall and Flowrider surfing simulator.

The ship is so vast that it boasts a shopping street, which looks a little like a shopping centre in a major city (pictured)

A terrifying-looking zip wire lets people zoom nine storeys above the main shopping street, while views of an ice rink and aquatheatre hint at the entertainment options aboard.

The company says: ‘With just a few clicks you can take a trip across our zip line, see our acrobats training in the AquaTheatre, and take a look in some of our unique dining experiences.

Viewers can also take a peek inside the different types of rooms available, although they cannot just wander around the ship.

Google created the Street View experience using a DSLR camera with a fisheye lens and a panoramic head resting on a tripod.

As well as letting people at home have a taste of a luxurious cruse holiday, the company hopes that the Street View experience will enable people booked onto the Allure of the Seas to get a better idea of what is on offer.

Jo Briody of the cruise line told The Telegraph: ‘Consumers go online to research their holidays and this is the closest they can get to actually being on board.’

Viewers can also take a peek inside the different types of rooms available, although they cannot just wander around the ship. This is a loft suite
