Ed Balls has spent the weekend insisting he is no longer part of a macho Labour gang.

But he was throwing his weight around on the football field today as Labour took on a team of journalists in a traditional pre-conference match.

The shadow chancellor, who has ridiculed the coalition for the flat-lining economy, found himself flat on his back as his team slumped to a 4-0 defeat.

With Labour rocked by revelations about the culture of smears and spin in the memoirs of Damian McBride, Mr Balls has admitted he was part of a blokeish culture which damaged Labour.

He told the Times newspaper: 'The period up to 1997 and after, yes, it was macho. I look back on that as a time we were young and inexperienced.

'It was something both [Blair and Brown] allowed to happen. It was a mistake and it was damaging to the government.'

Today he took to the field to play for Labour against the Lobby XI, and as he hurtled around the pitch struggled to stay on his feet.

It is not just on the football field that Labour - and Mr Balls - are struggling.

A
 damning new poll last night revealed just 20 per cent of people think 
he has the right policies for the economy - barely half of the 38 per 
cent who back the Tories.

The surprise surge in support for the 
Tories comes after two successive quarters of growth, leading Mr Osborne
 to boast that the economy has ‘turned a corner’.

According
 to the Ipsos Mori poll, 38 per cent of people now say the Conservatives
 have the best policies on the economy, with Labour trailing on just 20 
per cent.

It marks a dramatic shift in the last six months, when the two parties were neck and neck.

In March just 27 per cent of voters backed the Tories on the economy  with 26 per cent preferring Labour.

Mr
 Balls said he and Labour leader Ed Miliband would use the conference in
 Brighton to set out what more they can do to tackle the cost-of-living 
crisis and 'deliver a recovery that works for the many — and not just a 
few at the top'.

Writing in The Sun, he added: 'After three wasted years of flatlining, it's good news that our economy is at last growing again.

'But
 there's a lot of lost ground to catch up. And I know that for millions 
of working people across the country, it doesn't feel like a recovery.'

Ed Miliband today tried to distance himself from New Labour’s vile culture of spin and smears.

He
 insisted he had never been engaged in the sort of ‘reprehensible’ 
briefings against colleagues exposed in the memoirs of disgraced Gordon 
Brown spin doctor Damian McBride.

And
 he insisted it was not in his nature to take part in such behaviour, 
claiming: ‘I am not sure I have ever been accused of being macho.’

The Labour party conference in 
Brighton risks being dominated by the McBride memoirs, which have lifted
 the lid on the relentless in-fighting, briefings and smears which 
dominated the last government.

The
 scandal risks reminding voters of Mr Miliband’s role as a close 
lieutenant of Mr Brown, alongside shadow chancellor Mr Balls.

Mr Miliband today insisted he had urged Mr Brown to sack Mr McBride amid 
suspicions about his behaviour, which he said were ‘not my kind of 
politics’.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, whose is married to Mr Balls, said Mr McBride was 'out of control'.

She
 told Sky News' Murnaghan programme: 'I think this is ... about a kind 
of politics that really is appalling, that we should never go back to.

'It
 is something that happened some years ago, but I think it's a sign of 
how much the Labour Party has changed, the very different climate, the 
very different way in which Ed Miliband is managing things and operating
 things now, that's a good thing, we don't want to go back to the navel 
gazing of the past.'

Sitting pretty: Mr Balls was all smiles as he limbered up for the match, on the day before he delivers his keynote conference speech in Brighton
