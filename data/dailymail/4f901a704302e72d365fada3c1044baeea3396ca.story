Red hearts, red roses, red kisses - they're the three symbols that spell romance. 

With Valentine's Day just around the corner, it's time to inject a little passion into your life, and while I can't advise on hearts and flowers, I can definitely give you a helping hand when it comes to creating the perfect scarlet pout.  

This week I've selected my top five red lipsticks and come up with a few tips on choosing your ideal shade.

Binky Felstead says there is no better way of guaranteeing a Valentine's kiss than with a scarlet lip. here she shows you the secret behind five classic looks. Pictured: Binky wears the starter red - Clarins Joli Rouge Lipstick in Hibiscus

THE STARTER RED

If you're a little bit scared by full-blown scarlet, a good place to start is with a subtle shade of pinky red. These softer, magenta hues are less dominating than a bold blood red and they flatter all skin tones. 

My favourite is Clarins Joli Rouge Lipstick in Hibiscus, a satin formula that glides on beautifully straight from the bullet and colours your lips in a warm, glistening sunset shade. Long-wearing and wonderfully moisturising, this is a great everyday red.

THE FASHION RED

Right now, it's bang on trend to pair bright red lips with understated eyes and cheeks - you'll see all the celebs sporting this look. 

So a classic bright, fiery tone is a must for all fashion-conscious red-lipstick lovers. 

For a fashion red,  opt for bright fiery tones using a shade called Romance from the Binky London range

My favourite is a shade called Romance from my own Binky London range (above left). 

Okay, I may be a little biased, but I've tried and tested hundreds of reds and this one really is incredibly flattering - working equally well against pale, creamy complexions and golden tanned skins. 

Binky London Lipsticks are all also enriched with vitamin E, which leaves your lips feeling super-soft and moisturised - and just waiting to be kissed!

THE FEMME FATALE RED

When it comes to red lips for a glamorous night out or a romantic date, the shade to go for is a deep, dark, sultry scarlet. 

I've chosen another lipstick from my Binky London range, this time in a shade called Merlot. 

For the femme fatale look, Binky says to go for a deeper scarlet, like this Merlot shade from her Binky London range 

These rich, ruby reds look passionate, dramatic and sensual - they really make a statement. 

Thanks to its rich, hydrating formula, you can apply this lipstick straight from the bullet, but when I'm wearing a strong shade and want to create the perfect finish, I prefer to apply my red lippy with a lip brush to create a really polished, professional finish.

THE DAY TO NIGHT RED

Bold, tomato red is a real go-anywhere colour. Elegant and feminine by day; playful and vampy by night, it's a true cosmetics classic - the little black dress in lipstick form! 

Guerlain KissKiss Shaping Cream Lip Colour in Love Kiss is a vivid, vibrant shade, with a luscious, moisture-rich formula that gives it great staying power - exactly what you want for your a 24-hour pout. 

Pair this colour with another classic look - the cat's-eye eyeliner flick - and whatever time your Valentine calls round, you'll be feeling irresistible.

A vivid and vibrant shade can go from day to night in an instant, using a lipstick like Guerlain KissKiss Shaping Cream Lip Colour in Love Kiss

THE HOLLYWOOD RED

If you're after a dazzling pillar box shade - a real showstopper - then look no further than Clarins Rouge Éclat Lipstick in Passion Red.

A gorgeous red-carpet red, this lipstick makes a perfect accompaniment to glam smoky eyes. Plus the silky Clarins formula will keep your lips feeling smooth and won't dry out or bleed throughout the evening. 

The Hollywood red is the most classic of all and suits most skin tones (pictured: Clarins Rouge Éclat Lipstick in Passion Red)

Best of all, the cool tones in this red will make your teeth look whiter, giving you a real Hollywood smile.  

Lots of love (hopefully)
