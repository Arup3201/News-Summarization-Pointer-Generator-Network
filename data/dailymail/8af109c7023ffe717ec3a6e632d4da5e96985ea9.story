Canary babies: Gladys Sangster, now 97, said she was born with yellow-tinged skin

The First World War left a taint on everyone - but for some it happened more literally than others.

Now 97, Gladys Sangster is one of Britain's last surviving 'Canary Babies', born yellow because her mother worked on the Home Front pouring dangerous chemicals into shells.

She has long since lost her yellow glow, but claims it affected many of the children born where she still lives in Banbury, Oxfordshire.

More than 1,500 people there worked in National Shell Filling Factory Number Nine on the outskirts of Banbury during the Great War.

As many of them were women, they became known as the 'Canary Girls' when their skin became tainted by touching chemicals in the TNT powder they poured into bombs.

Traditional gunpowder had been replaced by materials such as cordite and sulphur which were mixed by hand despite being dangerous to human health.

The women's skin would break out into hives, their hair would be discoloured and although there were few injuries at Banbury, those in other factories lost their lives and limbs when explosives went off prematurely.

Less well known was that the same yellow colouring would apparently happen to their children - who were dubbed the 'Canary Babies'.

Mrs Sangster's mother Mary was in charge of a full team of women at the factory in Banbury, one of the largest of its kind in the country.

Her father, meanwhile, would accompany the filled shells by train to the coast where they would be shipped off to the front line on the Continent.

Mary Sangster brought in a doctor to examine her daughter, but was told there was nothing she could do - and the colour faded within a short time.

It seemed none of her family ever 
investigated whether there was a long-term risk to her health, but as 
far as Mrs Sangster knows she suffered no ill effects - and she is still
 going strong at 97.

'Nearly every baby was born yellow,' she said.

'Mum said you just took it for granted it happened and that was it. You 
were tougher in those days than what they are today!'

National Shell Filling Factory Number Nine is now in a field overgrown with brambles.

There is little to betray its former use - but because of it, the land is a protected site of archaeological significance.

Gladys's remarkable tale was revealed when she told her story to a volunteer project for the town's Banbury Museum.

They decided to record her experiences for posterity - one set among 1,400 in a new nationwide project by the Imperial War Museum and the BBC to mark 100 years since the outbreak of war.

Underappreciated: The women often risked their lives to make sure the country kept running during the war

World War One At Home is showcasing first-hand accounts of life on the Home Front in a series of broadcasts on BBC local radio stations, designed to link people to the war town by town.

Mrs Sangster's story was broadcast on Monday on BBC Radio Oxford.

Jane Markham, a researcher on the project, said: 'The chemicals that turned the women's skin yellow seemed to be very particular to the women who were working at close quarters to explosives.

'To have somebody still alive who can talk about something like this that happened 100 years ago is quite remarkable.'

BBC head of English programmes 
Craig Henderson said: 'These stories reveal familiar places across the
 nation in a new and fascinating light; places that we might drive or 
walk past every day without realising their historical resonance.

'These
 stories would have remained little-known about without the involvement 
of the many partners and organisations across the country who have 
supported our journalists in bringing them to light.'
