Arsenal's Joel Campbell is a transfer target for Benfica, according to reports in Portugal.

The Costa Rican forward, who enjoyed a  loan spell at Greek side Olympiacos last season, has broken into Arsene Wenger's first team squad since returning from the World Cup.

But both Record and O Jogo claim that Benfica boss Jorge Jesus wants to sign the 22-year-old after missing out on Palermo's Abel Hernandez.

The Uruguayan is on the brink of joining Hull City, leaving Benfica in the hunt for a new striker after selling Oscar Cardozo to Turkish side Trabzonspor.

Wenger, who will be without Olivier Giroud until January, has stated that he wants to keep Campbell for the 2014-15 campaign.

But whether the former Saprissa star will be content with a role from the bench at the Emirates remains to be seen.
