Manchester City face a race against time to secure Frank Lampard's availability for the home match against Sunderland on New Year's Day.

It is situation that remains as clear as mud as City attempt to break through the red tape and ensure he can play. Here is everything you need to know:

What is Lampard's contractual situation?

Lampard is in fact on a short-deal at Manchester City that began in the summer and expires at midnight on New Year's Day.

Lampard has been a hit for Manchester City since joining on loan from New York City FC

So he is not on loan from New York City as things stand?

No. Lampard agreed a pre-contract agreement in the summer with the American side and he was then unveiled as their player. However, his deal in New York does not commence until January 1.

How can City secure his services for the second half of the season?

For Lampard to remain a Manchester City player, the club must agree a loan deal with their sister outfit in New York. Pellegrini would like that deal to last until the end of the season. There was initial opposition from the States but it is understood that that tension has now subsided and an agreement has been reached with the sides. 

It is most likely that an indefinite loan deal will be agreed that allows Lampard to stay with Manchester City until the end of the season. However, it would also include a break clause that could allow Lampard to return to New York for the start of the MLS season in March or later if Manchester City's quest for trophies was to fall apart.

How have they managed to reach a compromise?

We imagine it all went a little bit like this: Ferran Soriano, chief executive officer of Manchester City calls up Ferran Soriano, chief executive officer of New York City FC and the two chaps found an agreement.

So what is the sticking point?

Lampard's Manchester City deal expires at midnight on New Year's Day. It is understood that if a Premier League club wishes to amend an existing contract of a player - as City wish to do with Lampard - then they require the permission of the Barclays Premier League board. This is the process that is continuing.

So is he ineligible to play on New Year's Day?

If this cannot be resolved, he cannot play. The situation remained 'live and complex' as of Wednesday afternoon, according to our sources, but City are still hopeful.

Is there an issue with renewing his registration as the transfer window does not open until January 3?

Although the transfer window does not open until January 3, Lampard's registration is not in doubt as the timespan for registering players goes from transfer window to transfer window, rather than being defined by the length of a player's contract.

So what remains to be done?

However, the Premier League board must sanction the amendment to the contract for this to happen. This, it is hoped, can be done outside of the transfer window. There remains a significant amount of paperwork to resolve that must pass through the Premier League. It must be squared off by the Premier League to allow Lampard to play.

Senior sources at City maintained on Wednesday that they remained hopeful of securing his registration. He is very much in Pellegrini's thinking for the matchday squad.
