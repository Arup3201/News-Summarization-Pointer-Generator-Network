Katie Price has never been one to hold back when it comes to details of her private life.

But the model has always been staunchly protective over the privacy of her disabled son Harvey.

Now in her latest autobiography Love, Lipstick And Lies she opens up about the tender relationship she shares with her eldest son and the daily challenges her family faces in looking after him.

Tender bond: Katie Price with her son Harvey seen here at the World of Golf in Sidcup, Kent share a strong bond

The 35-year-old says she finds it a shame that his dad footballer Dwight Yorke doesn't play a part in his life.

He only spoke to Harvey on his tenth birthday because Katie's mum had phoned his manager to say he should.

She
said: 'Dwight wouldn't even admit he was the father until a DNA test 
proved he was. He was gobsmacked when Harvey said to him (on the phone) 
"So when am I seeing you?"

'It's
such a shame. All I can say is he's missing out on a very special 
little boy. Dwight should try. He would get so much love in return.'

Temper tantrums: Katie worries that Harvey might hurt himself or whoever is nearby when he has a temper tanrum, which is why he is never left alone with her two other children Junior, eight and Princess, six

Without regular medication Harvey 
would die. But when it comes to looking after her son Katie is not 
looking for any sympathy and describes Harvey as a 'the most fantastic 
little boy'

Devoted mum: Katie Price worries everyday about her son Harvey's well-being, but insists in her eyes he is perfect and a very 'special' little boy

Price explains the entire family - 
including her mum Amy who gave up her job to help Katie care for Harvey -
have to follow a strict routine to keep Harvey calm and happy 
throughout the day.

She has
apparently 'lost count of the number of televisions' her 11-year-old 
son Harvey has smashed when he's had temper tantrums and has had to fit 
Perspex screens to avoid it happening again. 

She also worries he might hurt himself or her other children, which is 
why he is never left alone with my two other children Junior, eight and 
Princess, six. 

But she is 
happy to tell how her tender relationship with her disabled son has 
blossomed and insists that her main goal is to give him the best 
possible start in life.

The reality star can anticipate when he's going to 
have a tantrum and deal with it before it happens. But admits sometimes it happens too quickly to do so.

She said: 'I wish all those people who show ignorance about the disabled condition could spend a day with Harvey and see the reality of looking after a child like him.

Harvey was recently diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder and Oppositional Defiance Disorder. Along with his autism all 
three conditions make a huge impact on his behaviour.

ADD means that he finds 
it hard to concentrate and focus and the ODD makes him aggressive meaning he needs constant supervision.

Routine is everything: Katie Price (pictured above) takes time out of the strict daily routine the entire family follow with children Princess Tiaamii, Junior and Harvey
at 'The Lion King' 3D film premiere, London in 2011

New beginnings: Katie Price and her new husband Kieran Hayler arrive back in the UK after their wedding earlier this year and Katie with ex-husband Peter Andre who is no longer in Harvey's life (pictured here in 2009)

Katie explains Harvey can dominate family life, which is hard on Junior and Princess, but appreciates most families with a disabled child will experience these struggles.

But the mother-of-four - she has a newborn son Jett Riviera with new husband Kieran Hyler -  is pleased with the progress Harvey is making and thinks he is becoming more independent.

Harvey might not have his biological dad -
or Katie's ex husband Peter Andre - in his life anymore but his mum is 
keen to give him the best possible start in life.

Light relief: 'We have good days and we have bad days, we have funny days and challenging days. But I love him to bits and he's perfect to me.' Katie takes her kids and friends to the theatre in London

Legal battle: Katie and ex-husband Alex Reid were seen attending a court hearing in Holborn on Tuesday
