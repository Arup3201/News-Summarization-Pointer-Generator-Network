Model and star of Celebrity Big Brother Casey Batchelor appeared in a music video alongside Lostprophets' paedophile Ian Watkins.

In the video for A Town Called Hypocrisy, the brunette can be seen dancing around in the background in front of an audience.

The model is only wearing underwear in the footage - filmed six years before Watkins' crimes were revealed in court.

The 29-year-old's agent said the model was asked to appear in the video and never saw or spoke to any of the band ever again. There is no suggestion she knew anything about Watkins' crimes.

The song from album Liberation Transmission reached number 23 in the chart and spent two weeks in the top 40.

Watkins, 36, from Pontypridd, Wales, was sentenced to over 35 years in jail at Cardiff Crown Court last month.

He pleaded guilty to 13 offences, including two counts of attempted rape of a baby.

His two accomplices,Â  named as Woman A and Woman B for legal reasons, were jailed for 14 years and 16 years respectively.

The court heard how, after touching a groupie's 11-month-old baby, Watkins attempted to have sex with the child.

He also tried to persuade another fan to abuse her child over the on a webcam.

He also had a collection of child porn videos - some of which were made by the rocker.

Sentencing judge Mr Justice Royce told Watkins: 'Those who have appeared in these courts over many years see a large number of horrific cases. This case, however, breaks new ground.

'I am satisfied that you are a deeply corrupting influence, you are highly manipulative, you are a sexual predator, you are dangerous.

'The public and, in particular, young females need protection from you.'

Yesterday Watkins lodged an application for permission to appeal his prison term at the Court of Appeal. He will use legal aid to fund the case.
