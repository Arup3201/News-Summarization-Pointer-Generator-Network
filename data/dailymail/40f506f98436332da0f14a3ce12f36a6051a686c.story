A 25-year-old Hawaii surfer has survived a dramatic attack by a 12-foot tiger shark by jumping on top of it and punching it in the eye.

Jeff Horton, a former boxer, said he was surfing off Pila'a Beach near Kilaueai in Kauai on Sunday with friends when he spotted a dark shape moving toward him and his board through the water.

He explained that he was looking for a wave and seated with his feet dangling from the board.

'I look down and see what I thought was a sting ray,' Horton told Fox News. 'It came up on me and I jerked my foot and kicked it a couple of times. It went for the bite and missed my leg.'

Lucky escape: Jeff Horton, a surfer in Hawaii, has survived a shark attack after hitting it in its eye

Damage: The shark's teeth marks can be seen on Horton's board - which he said he'll be putting on his wall

Horton pulled his left leg from the water and got on the surfboard, but was knocked off when the shark clamped its teeth down on the board.

'I rolled to the top of the shark and punched it in the mouth and got one shot in the eye,' Horton said. 'I thought I was going to die unless I put up the best fight I ever had.'

He estimated that he hit the shark, which he guessed was about 12 feet long, about eight times.

But when he punched it once in the eye, it recoiled, giving him a chance to jump on his board and frantically paddle back to the shore with another surfer.

'At that point I was pretty much in a full panic and started swimming for my life,' he said. 'I saw the shadow of its belly following me underneath.'

Even though the shark followed, it did not attack again.

When they reached the shore, he was welcomed back by a group of people and a tourist gave him $50 and told him to buy a bottle, The Garden Island reported.

Horton's only injuries were scratches from the shark's rough skin on his knuckles and legs.

'I'm lucky to be here today,' he said.

The 7-foot board, however, was left with a semi-circle imprint of the shark's jaws. Horton, who surfed again Monday at another beach, said he plans to put it up on his wall.

Horton moved to Kauai from Washington D.C. two years ago and said, while he's been traumatized by the experience, he will be returning to the water.

But he said he won't be using the board - which displays the circular teeth marks of the shark - again; instead he plans to hang it on his wall.

'I'll surf the rest of my life,' he told The Garden Island.

Tiger sharks are considered dangerous due to their size and indiscriminate feeding behavior and willingness to eat nearly anything - including objects at the surface, Hawaii Sharks explains.

Some bites sustained by people are thought to be the result of investigatory behavior as the sharks bite creatures or objects to determine whether they are suitable to be eaten.

There have been no reported shark attacks around Kauai this year. Three were recorded last year.
