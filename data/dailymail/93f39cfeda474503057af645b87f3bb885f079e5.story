Eric Thomas Trinchet, 28, was said to have killed the child while high on prescription drugs after he and his girlfriend got into a violent argument.

Police in Polk County were told by Trinchet that he shook the baby because she was crying and then returned her to her crib during the fight with Miss Irizarry.

Trinchet, who was known to police, said he knew what he had done to the child and slept for two days after the incident.

He turned himself in at 3am on Wednesday morning because of the 'guilt'.

The baby girl was taken to Lakeland Regional Medical Center on May 1 where she was discovered to have a brain injury, bruises on her left foot and ears and puncture wounds to the thigh.
