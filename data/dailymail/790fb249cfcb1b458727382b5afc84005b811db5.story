The mother of Ariel Castro's children repeatedly went to authorities with accusations he was beating, abusing and threatening her.

But her complaints never reached the point where Castro was imprisoned or triggered additional police investigations.

The late Grimilda Figueroa's accusations against Castro began in 1989 and the last came in 2005, three years after he allegedly kidnapped the first of three women and held them in a run-down house in Cleveland.

In the first case, he was not sentenced to prison and in the other two Figueroa chose to drop proceedings.

Domestic abuse experts said victims 
in such cases often change their mind because they are afraid, or they 
lack knowledge of the legal system.

Castro now has been charged with 
three counts of raping Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight 
and four counts of kidnapping the three women and his daughter born to 
Berry while in captivity.

An Ohio prosecutor said on Thursday 
he intends to charge Castro with murder in connection with the 
starvation and abuse of Knight during pregnancies that led to 
miscarriages.

Figueroa died in April 2012, at the 
age of 48, from an accidental overdose of painkiller oxycodone, 
according to an Indiana coroner.

Her last complaint against Castro, a 
2005 request to the court for an 'order of protection' could have been a
missed opportunity to expose him, domestic abuse experts said.

If he had violated the order he could
have been investigated by police and possibly arrested. That could have
been an opportunity to find the women he allegedly held captive, or it 
could have made things worse if they had been abandoned without him and 
unable to leave the house.

Castro, a former school bus driver, showed no reaction during the prosecutor's statement, staring intently at the floor

Figueroa also filed a police report 
in 2005 saying Castro had threatened to 'beat your ass' in front of 
their daughter, according to the report.

A spokeswoman for Cleveland Mayor 
Frank Jackson said that police told Figueroa that year to go to the 
county prosecutor's office and file a criminal complaint but she did 
not.

Instead, Figueroa sought a civil 
order of protection in county court. In Ohio, a victim can get a civil 
order without criminal charges because they believe this will be less 
upsetting to the offender, said Anne Murray, director of the domestic 
violence and stalking unit for the city of Columbus, which is 140 miles 
from Cleveland.

Figueroa eventually dropped even that request for a protection order and so the court case was dismissed.

'That breaks my heart,' Murray said.

Figueroa had four children with 
Castro - Anthony, Arlene, Angie and Emily - and her efforts to protect 
herself from him spanned at least 16 years.

The first incident was in 1989. 
Castro pleaded no contest and was given a year of probation after 
Figueroa made a domestic violence complaint against him, according to a 
Cuyahoga County court document.

On December 26, 1993, Castro was arrested after he arrived home drunk and began beating Figueroa, police said.

'I was afraid that he would come home
in this condition so I had already called police,' a police report at 
the time quoted Figueroa as telling them.

She told police that he had thrown 
her to the ground, hit her about the face and head and kicked her, 
according to a Cleveland police report.

Their 12-year-old son, Anthony, ran out of the house to get help for Figueroa and was pursued by Castro, the report said.

When a grand jury considered the 
incident, Figueroa said she could not remember the abuse, according to 
court documents. The case was dropped.

'She was afraid,' said Chris 
Giannini, a former police officer and owner of International 
Investigations, a private investigations company, who tried to help 
protect Figueroa from Castro.

Domestic violence experts say abuse 
victims often raise charges and then back down from pursuing them out of
fear or other difficulties with the legal system.

'If they don't have the support and 
the knowledge to go through with what they need to do, a lot of victims 
stop,' said Linda D. Johanek, chief executive officer of Cleveland's 
Domestic Violence & Child Advocacy Center.

According to Cuyahoga County court 
documents, Figueroa had been granted full custody of her and Castro's 
children by 1997. By then, she was in a new relationship with a man 
named Fernando Colon, who was a guard at a hospital where she went for 
her injures from Castro's beatings, according to Colon.

On August 29, 2005, Figueroa went to 
court again, seeking an order of protection against Castro. She also 
said he had threatened to kill her and her children during the previous 
year and had 'abducted' the children.

A year before that complaint, two of 
the daughters, Emily and Arlene, accused her new partner, Colon, of 
sexual abuse, Giannini said. He investigated the case on behalf of 
Colon, and believes that Castro manipulated his daughters into accusing 
Colon. Figueroa and Colon denied the abuse.

Colon was convicted in September 2005
on five charges of child molestation based on the testimony of the 
daughters, and was sentenced to three years of community supervision, 
according to court documents.

Arlene Castro declined to be 
interviewed by Reuters. Emily Castro is in prison serving a 25-year 
sentence after being convicted of attempting to murder her baby daughter
in 2007 by slashing her throat.

Also in September 2005, authorities tried to serve Castro with a summons to attend a hearing on Figueroa's complaint.

'They went to his house three times 
and no one answered,' said Diane Palos, administrative judge for the 
domestic relations court in Cleveland. Castro came to the court to get 
the summons, she said.

The hearing on Figueroa's petition 
was held in November 2005. Court records show Castro and Figueroa both 
attended the hearing as did Castro's lawyer.

Figueroa's lawyer, Robert Ferreri, did not show up, citing a conflict with another case in juvenile court, records show.

Ferreri, a former Cuyahoga County 
judge, resigned from the practice of law in 2011 as he was facing 
discipline, according to the Ohio Supreme Court. His law license had 
been suspended twice before in 1999 and 2000.

Repeated attempts by Reuters reporters to reach Ferreri by phone or at residences listed for him were unsuccessful.

Figueroa decided not to proceed with 
the request for a protection order, according to court documents. Her 
lawyer advised her that she would be at a severe disadvantage if she 
went ahead without him, documents show. The case was dismissed and she 
did not exercise her legal right to revive it.

'She feared this man (Castro),' said 
Colon, who now is unemployed and on disability. 'This man had her 
psychologically under control. Every movement she made, he was aware of.
He threatened to kill her and the kids.'

Since 2005, victims' advocates have 
been added to the justice system in Ohio to guide women through the 
hearing without a lawyer, said Alexandria Ruden, senior attorney at the 
Legal Aid Society of Cleveland.

Another innovation is that in the 
past 15 to 20 years the justice system has become more sensitive to the 
pressures on battered women, said Mat Heck, prosecuting attorney for 
Montgomery County, Ohio, and chairman-elect of the American Bar 
Association's criminal justice section.

Authorities are now more willing to prosecute domestic violence cases even when the victim does not want to, he said.

If Figueroa had gotten the protection
order, it would have been effective for five years. Any violation by 
Castro could have been prosecuted as a crime.

'It's possible that had she gotten that order, there could have been follow-up prosecution, absolutely,' Ruden said.

Figueroa decided in late 2005 to move 
her children to Indiana, according to Giannini and Colon. After she died
last year, her son Anthony Castro, who now lives in Columbus, Ohio, 
posted on the funeral home online guest book: 'Dear Mom. You are gone 
too soon. But your suffering is over.
