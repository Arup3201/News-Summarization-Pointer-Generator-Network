The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS John Stennis has left Puget Sound in Washington for a training mission after a $240 million overhaul.

The Stennis is 1,092 feet long with a 4.5-acre flight deck and can carry as many as 6,000 sailors and Marines. 

It has its own hospital, operating room, fire department and post office.

The first stop for the 20-year-old Stennis after leaving Bremerton on Monday is Naval Magazine Indian Island, where it is scheduled to pick up six million pounds of ammunition.

That process is expected to take three days and more than 1,400 crane lifts.

The Stennis returned from its last mission supporting the war in Afghanistan in May 2013 and underwent a 16-month, $240 million overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. 

In 2012, the vessel was at the centre of a dispute with Iran when it left the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz after Tehran launched a series of military exercises.

Iran warned it would take action if the aircraft carrier returned.

General Ataollah Salehi said at the time: 'Iran will not repeat its warning... the enemy's carrier has been moved to the Sea of Oman because of our drill. 

Tehran also threatened shutting the strait - through which 40 per cent of the world's traded oil is shipped - if foreign powers imposed sanctions on its crude exports. 

'I advise, recommend and warn them [the Americans] over the return of this carrier to the Persian Gulf because we are not in the habit of warning more than once.'

Gen Salehi did not name the vessel, or give details of the action Iran would take if it did return.

A year earlier, ten sailors were injured on the USS John Stennis when a jet fighter's engine exploded as it prepared to take off.

The F/A-18C Hornet was starting a training exercise when the accident occurred on the flight deck of the vessel in waters off California.

Four sailors were flown to Naval Medical Center San Diego where they were in stable condition.

The six others were treated for burn injuries on board the carrier.

The Stennis was conducting qualification flights for pilots and crews about 100 miles off the coast of San Diego at the time of the accident.
