Residents of a country estate owned by an aristocrat have been forced to complain to the police after the area became a dogging hotspot.

Groups of men dressed in PVC, fairy wings and tutus have been gathering in farm buildings on the Badminton Estate in Wiltshire for sordid sex parties.

Now police have started regular patrols across the land, which is owned by the Duke of Beaufort, in a bid to crack down on the voyeurs.

Trouble: Police have been called to the Badminton Estate after locals complained about doggers

Nick Bush, a tenant farmer who lives in the hamlet of West Kington, called officers after several unsuccessful attempts to drive the doggers away.

'On one occasion I found four bras hanging up,' he said. 'On another there were a couple of old boys who said, "We're only here for having a bit of fun mate."

'We get all sorts of undesirable activities other than enjoying the view. I have interrupted cars but I've never bothered to get out and remonstrate.'

Mr Bush added: 'Nobody wants them in their back yard. The problem is if you shut one down they move to another.'

The gatherings are believed to take place in a burned-out barn where police caught a group of men having sex last year.

Event: The estate is known for hosting the Badminton Horse Trials in the grounds of the home

Officers say there has recently been a surge of complaints from residents who are being disturbed by doggers.

Sergeant Phil Connor said: 'In the last two weeks we have had complaints from numerous outraged residents about vehicles arriving at the site and the occupants engaging in sexual activity.

'We are going to be doing extensive patrols in the evenings to deter any further activity and reassure those in the community.'

One woman living nearby said: 'I've seen cars pulling away late at night. I wouldn't stop there - it's quite threatening when you know what's happening.

'None of us are very happy about it. It's not very nice to think that that's going on somewhere up the road.'

Home: The estate is owned by David, 11th Duke of Beaufort

Another woman, who has lived in the village for 50 years, said she regularly sees cars parked up at the site which flash their lights at her as she goes by.

She said: 'It is surprising how many flash at you, perhaps that's what they do to attract other men.

'They've never caused us any harm - but they do leave a lot of rubbish.'

One man added: 'You don't want that sort of thing going on in your village.'

The estate centres on Badminton House in Gloucestershire, ancestral home of the duke, which is known for hosting the Badminton Horse Trial.
