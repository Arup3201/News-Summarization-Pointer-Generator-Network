As comedians and talk show hosts have their way with Donald Trump over his 'huge' announcement the real estate mogul is sticking to his guns in his first live TV appearance since making the request.

Trump was a guest on the Late Show With David Letterman, to further explain the offer - which turned out to be a $5million charity donation in exchange for Obama's old college and passport records.

When asked by Letterman why he was orchestrating the demand, Trump replied: 'Transparency.'

He added: 'There's too much we don't know about our president.'

Playing to the audience: Donald Trump was offered the opportunity to explain his demand that President Obama show his college and passport records with David Letterman

When Letterman asked what kind of damning evidence would be revealed by college records, Trump said: 'A line saying place of birth' - an apparent indication that Trump still may not believe the president was born in the U.S., despite Obama’s release of his birth certificate last year.

'I hope everything [in Obama's records] is perfect - and it might be.'

'If it was negative - there wouldn't be an election.'

On the subject of Obama’s birth certificate, Trump said that it took Obama six years to provide it, when ‘I could give it to you in less than an hour.'

Sticking to his guns: Trump, seen outside the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City, is standing by his offer of $5million to the charity of President Obama's choice if he releases the records

Marketing: Trump also discussed his line of shirts and ties, all of which are made in Bangladesh and China, respectively

As the audience applauded, Trump raised his hands, relishing in the moment on the late night stage.

But Letterman ordered the crowd to stop clapping, saying 'the breeze will disturb [Trump's] hair.'

Moving along, Trump said that what he
likes most about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is his 
stance on China before showing off his shirt and tie line currently 
being sold at Macy’s stores.

But as Letterman quickly revealed, the ties were made in China.

Hours earlier, Trump has received an counter-offer to his 'bordering-on-gigantic' news about the President.

Trump had hyped his 'big reveal' for several days on major news outlets while incessantly tweeting about his 'game changer' information in the final weeks before the election.

Political satirist Stephen Colbert has now ramped up the stakes for the Apprentice star by offering Trump a donation to a charity of his choice - with rather more x-rated consequences.

On his Comedy Central show The Colbert Report, the sarcastic host told the audience: 'Mr Trump, I will write you a cheque to the charity of your choice for $1million.... if you will let me dip my balls in your mouth.'

Colbert added: 'Nothing would make me happier than to write this cheque... and nothing would make America happier than something going into your mouth instead of coming out of it.'

Trump had yet to respond to Colbert's offer which the comic set for '5pm on October 31' - the same deadline that Trump gave the President.

Trump made his YouTube offer on Wednesday at noon,  promising 
to donate $5million to a charity of the President's choice if he revealed the information.

The tycoon denied his elaborate staging was a publicity stunt, insisting this was 'not a media 
event', but instead is 'about the United States of America'.

Colbert, who is left-leaning, was far from the only public figure to mock the billionaire businessman.

Broadcaster Barbara Walters scolded her 'friend' on The View today saying: 'Donald, you're not hurting Obama, you're hurting Donald, and that hurts me because you're a decent man.'

Trump was characteristically unrepentant today, returning to Twitter to directly respond: '@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv--Why did you choose me as one of the 10 Most Fascinating People of the Year last season (and more than once?)'

The Internet exploded yesterday with mock responses to the Apprentice star's announcement.

Comedian Andy Borowitz tweeted: 'Attention
parents: if you give your children even the tiniest bit of attention 
now, maybe they won't grow up to be Donald Trump.'

Observers on the right also slated Trump, who has publicly endorsed Republican Mitt Romney.

Jim Geraghty of the conservative National Review, wrote: 'If at any point you seriously considered Donald Trump for president, please study the error of your ways in quiet, private contemplation.'

However there was support for Trump's actions with those echoing his call for most transparency from the President including conservative talk show host Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter.

Defence: Trump took to Twitter to claim that his announcement was public-spirited, not self-serving

There are a number of conspiracy 
theories surrounding Obama's college records, the most popular being that he had poor grades and that he had attended college as a foreign exchange student.

The latter ties into Trump's other argument, the so-called 'birther' conspiracy, that the President was born in Kenya and not Hawaii thus making him ineligible for the White House.

Although a White House response was not expected, Obama addressed the matter directly when he appeared on the Jay Leno Show last night.

Obama told the TV host that the rivalry between himself and Trump began in their childhood. ‘This all dates back to when we were growing up in Kenya,' he joked. 'We had constant run-ins on the soccer field, he wasn’t very good.’

It had been suggested that Trump's revelation was that he had unearthed divorce papers between the President and his wife Michelle.

The claims about divorce papers have previously been made in a book released earlier this year by author Ed Klein. The White House rubbished the allegations then and claimed Klein had a history of making things up.
