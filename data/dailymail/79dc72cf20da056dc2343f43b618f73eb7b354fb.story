Chelsea's extra-time hero Branislav Ivanovic was singled out for special praise by Jose Mourinho after the Serbian defender's display during the Blues' Capital One Cup semi-final victory over Liverpool.

Ivanovic headed past Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet to settle a thrilling contest at Stamford Bridge.  

Mourinho claimed Ivanovic has the mentality of a champion and will tell the Chelsea defender to present his blood filled boot to the young academy players to show them how to be a winner.

The defender's effort settled the second leg at Stamford Bridge and sees Chelsea advance to the final 

‘He has lots of blood and the boot is completely full of red blood and it should go straight to the academy,' Mourinho explained.

The game certainly proved a feisty encounter with Diego Costa and Martin Skrtel clashing on several occasions.

Chelsea will play either Sheffield United or Tottenham in the final at Wembley.

Meanwhile, Chelsea skipper John Terry has the chance to take part in an 11th major final after Chelsea's  victory on Tuesday night.

Terry has won five FA Cup titles and two League Cups, winning seven of the 10 finals in which he has been involved so far.

He missed two of Chelsea’s biggest finals in recent years - through suspension when they won the Champions League title in 2012 and through injury in the Europa League the following year - although he did, of course, lift the trophy on both occasions.

The Champions League gave Terry his most painful experience in a final in 2008 when his missed penalty proved crucial in Manchester United’s shoot-out victory.
