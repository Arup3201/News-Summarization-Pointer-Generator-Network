Why stand in line all morning when you can make your own Cronuts in about an hour?

First sold by the Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York, the croissant-doughnut that took over the city’s SoHo neighborhood earlier this year can now be made from the comfort of your own kitchen.

The good news? You don’t need any croissants, doughnuts or an alarm clock.

Behold: Dominique Ansel's cronuts can now be had without hours on line or by paying through the nose on Craigslist

The ingredients for the dough are all fairly common: Butter, an egg, flour, milk, salt, sugar, water and yeast. A fancy French market isn’t necessary, any supermarket will do.

According to the recipe from Googly Gooeys, the first step is to combine the salt, yeast butter, flour and sugar and blend in a food processor while heating the milk and water on a stove.

Once thoroughly blended and combined with an egg, the ingredients should go in the refrigerator while the dough rises.

While the yeast is doing its thing, it’s time to make the filling. Combine eggs, sugar, flour and your fruit of choice, in this case oranges, and heat all ingredients thoroughly.

Once your filling is ready, your dough should be good to go.

What line?: Standing on-line for Cronuts is so last-month

Remove it from the fridge, roll it out and dust with flour before folding it over three times and cutting the cronuts using a doughnut cutter.

Next up is the most fun part! Deep fry each side at 160 degrees Celsius for about one minute while dumping strawberries, icing sugar, egg white and lemon into a blender for your frosting.

The icing should be ready by the time the cronuts cool down. Put it all together and you’ll be ready to brag to your friends

Invented by French baker Dominique Ansel and sold at his SoHo bakery since June, cronuts fans spend hours each morning on line to buy the famous pastries - which usually sell out shortly after the bakery's 8am opening.

Cronuts have even spawned an underground economy, with pricey delivery services springing up on Craigslist.
