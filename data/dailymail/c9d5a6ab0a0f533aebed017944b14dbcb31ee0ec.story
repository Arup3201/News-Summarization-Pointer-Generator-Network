Sharp-eyed viewers criticised the first series of Downton Abbey when latter day sights including a TV aerial intruded into its Edwardian scenes.

Now ITV's award-winning period drama has fallen foul of keen-eared fans too – over its use of modern slang.

Characters in the second series – written by Julian Fellowes and set in the First World War – have been uttering phrases not popularised until 40 years later.

Downton Abbey: The curse of anachronism has hit the ITV show once again

Footman Thomas Barrow used 'get 
knotted' in one episode earlier this month, while in Sunday's instalment
 he said: 'I am fed up seeing our lot get shafted.'

Both expressions are believed to have 
originated in the 1960s. Meanwhile, Captain Matthew Crawley, while in 
the trenches, used the modern-sounding phrase: 'You have been taking 
logic pills again.'

ShaftedIn its colloquial meaning, the word is recorded in  a slang dictionary from the late 1950s.

Logic pillsThis unusual phrase is not thought to have been used in the early 20th century.

Get knottedThis phrase, meaning 'go to hell', is not recorded in the OED until 1963.

Everything in the garden is rosyThe phrase has not been found written down before 1929.

And head housemaid Anna Smith told 
John Bates in last week's episode: 'So everything in the garden is 
rosy?' It is believed this phrase was not used until at least the 
mid-1920s.

The latest apparent gaffes come after 
viewers accused the second series of historical inaccuracy when it 
launched in September and a character used the phrase, 'As if'.

John Simpson, of the Oxford English 
Dictionary, confirmed that 'get knotted' was recorded as being in use 
from 1963. He said: 'I did think "shafted" felt quite wrong... it 
imposed too much of 1960s and 1970s culture on to the scene.'

And he added that he had not found 
the expression 'logic pills' in use around 1920 – or, indeed, 'much at 
all' – while he had discovered the phrase 'everything in the garden is 
rosy' in the 1929 edition of Electronic Engineering.

'One might assume it was around at 
least a few years earlier,' he said. 'We need to bear in mind that the 
programme is light entertainment,' he went on.

(played by Rob James-Collier, left) and Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens,

'Expressions may be anachronistic, and they may also be used by the wrong “class'. That is common with costume drama.'

Una Maguire, of Downton production 
company Carnival Films, admitted: 'We suspect "shafted" wasn't used 
then. We didn't get that right.'

But she claimed 'get knotted' was 19th
 century naval slang. And she said of the 'logic pills' dialogue: 'It is
 not a common phrase now and we are not saying it was a common phrase 
then either.'

'It is original writing,' she said. 'We believe the phrase “everything in the garden is rosy' came in in about 1917.'
