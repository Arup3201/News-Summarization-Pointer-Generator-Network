Romelu Lukaku may miss the start of the World Cup after suffering an ankle strain during Belgium's 1-0 win over Tunisia in Brussels on Saturday.

The 21-year-old striker will sit out training for the next four days, meaning that he is an injury doubt for Belgium's Group H opener against Algeria on June 17.

Belgian fans will be particularly worried as they have already lost Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke from the World Cup squad due to an Achilles injury he sustained two months ago, leaving Lukaku as their main striker.

Lukaku had been in great form, scoring three goals in a 5-1 win over Luxembourg and adding another in a 2-0 away win against Sweden over the past two weeks, as well as netting 16 times in 33 appearances on loan at Everton last season.

South Korea and Russia are Belgium's other Group H opponents.
