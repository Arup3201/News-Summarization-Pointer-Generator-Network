He just turned 65-years-old in October. But Bruce Jenner is showing no signs of slowing down.

In fact, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is speeding up his life by entering the dangerous five-day Baja 1000 race with his lesser-known son Burt, according to TMZ.

The competition, which begins Wednesday, has seen several drivers die in the past few years due to high speeds and challenging conditions on the off road course through the Mexican desert.

A thumbs up move?: Bruce Jenner and son Burt, pictured on a race car in September, will compete together in the Baja 1000 race in the Mexican desert starting on Wednesday

The E! star will have to do a fair share of the driving himself.

His son will take on the first 400 miles and the former Olympian will do the next segment. But he will hand over the keys again to Burt for the big finish.

Last year 30-year-old X Games star Kurt Caselli was killed during the competition. Several drivers, and even spectators, have died during the race.

It's official: Both Bruce and Burt, along with Craig Potts, have their name on the poster for the event which will take place from November 12 to 16

This is an odd choice for Jenner, who has been seen in recent months with a more feminine body, longer hair and manicured nails.

But it may be a way for him to get closer to his son Burt, who he had with his first wife Chrystie Crownover (they were man and wife from 1972 to 1981). They also had a child named Casey.

Bruce had Brody and Brandon with wife Linda Thompson (they were wed from 1981 to 1985), and daughters Kendall and Kylie with Kris (who he married in 1991 but split from in 2013).

The Baja 1000 race has $1m in sponsorships from companies such as Gladiator Tires and House Beer.

The entrance fee is at least $125,000. Trucks used in the race cost about $500,000. Then there is the cost of being on the road for five days which can be steep.

The site reported that Bruce is not using any of his own money for this. The reality star is reportedly worth around $100m.

She will most likely not be at the race: The E! star seen in LA on Monday; the beauty has not been pictured with Bruce since it was reported he was dating her old friend Ronda Kamihira

Jenner was last seen at a Starbucks in Agoura Hills, which is not far from the Hidden Hills mansion he used to share with Kris, on Thursday.

He wore his hair in a ponytail and looked trim in a blue top and jeans.

The avid golfer was still wearing his wedding band from momager Kris even though he is reportedly dating his estranged wife's old friend Ronda Kamihira.

The Kardashians are on the air currently with Kourtney & Khloe Take The Hamptons. They are also shooting season 10 of Keeping Up With Kardashians.
