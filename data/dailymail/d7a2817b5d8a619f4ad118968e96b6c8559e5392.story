A 19-year-old accused of stabbing his girlfriend's father to death while he slept claims the girl asked him several times to kill him because he was abusive.

In a twisting murder plot, 19-year-old Jose Martinez has been arrested in the death of Jaime Meza Guzman, 45, while he slept in his Las Vegas, Nevada home on Monday with the teen accusing his daughter as being behind the plot.

Found stabbed 30 to 40 times in his bed, both Mr Guzman's 17-year-old daughter and Martinez have been charged with murder, conspiracy and burglary, according to the Las Vegas Sun.

Attack: Jose Martinez, 19, has been arrested and charged alongside his 17-year-old girlfriend in the murder of her father on Monday

Speaking with police following his arrest this week, Martinez said he jumped on Guzman and stabbed him with a 3-inch pocket knife several times before placing a blanket over his body.

Discovering the father still breathing, the 19-year-old said he continued to strike at the man until he stopped.

The girlfriend, whose name has not been released due to her age, stood with her back to her father according to Martinez, facing the bedroom's door that had been stuffed underneath with blankets to muffle any sounds.

Martinez told police Guzman denied ever being abusive as he pleaded for his life.

The Sun reports Martinez laughing 'incredulously' during the man's plead.

While both Martinez and the girl took a polygraph test, with Martinez several times changing his story according to police, a tipster is said to have called in accusing the daughter behind the plot to murder.

Relaying the claims that were made against him, Martinez told police he approached two friends for help with the crime on behalf of his girlfriend, who both refused.

Martinez said the friends called the request 'a lot to ask of a friend,' according to the Sun.

Martinez told police he didn't want to kill Guzman but hoped to delay any action until the girl could leave the house on her own.

Motive: After detectives interviewed Martinez he said that his girlfriend accused her father of abusing her and had asked several times to help her kill him

Speaking to police this week, the 17-year-old said that she and her father had gotten into a fight on Sunday evening over her career choice before she snuck out around 3.30am on Monday morning to see Martinez.

When his girlfriend later called him telling him it was time, he said he came over and together they entered into Guzman's bedroom.

Police arriving at the scene of the crime just after noon said they found a Post-it-Note on the girl's bedroom floor reading: 'He's slept with the door open and woke up with I called you. Don't hear snoring now only little,' the green sheet of paper, matching a similar set on her desk read, reports the Sun.

Martinez is set for a court hearing on Thursday. It wasn't immediately clear if he had an attorney.

When detectives informed the girl of Martinez's confession, asking her if she'd like a parent or other guardian present, she asked for an attorney.

The police report stated that she showed no emotion to the accusation made against her of murdering her father.
