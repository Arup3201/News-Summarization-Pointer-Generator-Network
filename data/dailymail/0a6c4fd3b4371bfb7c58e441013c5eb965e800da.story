A size 24 woman has hit back at her critics saying she is 'healthy' and happy with her weight - and has no intention of slimming down.

Helen Dee, from Surrey, says the only time she is miserable is when she is on a diet - and would always choose chocolate over an apple because she 'loves food'.

She told ITV's Daybreak: 'I do feel healthy, but I know a lot of people will think otherwise. Personally, I feel healthy, happy and do everything I want to do.'

'Healthy': Helen Dee is a size 24 but says she is happy, loves good and has no plans to slim down

But she admitted she does feel great pressure to lose weight.

She told  hosts Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones: 'There is such a lot of pressure and some of the comments can be quite hurtful.

'People will say "you're such a fun girl, it's a shame you're not a lot slimmer".

'But I'm very lucky and confident and it's water off a duck's back to me.'

'It's
 not that I don't want to be helped - I just don't want to diet. For me,
 a diet starts on a Monday and stops by a Tuesday. I have zero willpower
 and am not going to choose a salad over something greasy.

'I do love life, but even the healthiest people pass away.'

Ms Dee spoke out after a new report warned that millions of people in the UK could be failing to recognise that they are obese - putting themselves at risk of early death.

The research, conducted by the charity Nuffield Health, found that two-fifths of obese people had no concerns about serious illness due to their weight.

Unaware: Ms Dee - with Daybreak's Dr Hilary Jones - spoke out after a new report warned that millions of people in the UK could be failing to recognise that they are obese - putting themselves at risk of early death

Being obese increases the risk of a 
number of potentially fatal diseases such as heart disease, some types 
of cancer, stroke and type 2 diabetes. 

But many people simply believe they are overweight instead of clinically obese, a charity spokeswoman said.

Meanwhile, 44 per cent of those who are obese said they have no concerns 
about serious illness due to their weight. And many did not recognise 
the links between obesity and health problems.

Eight in 10 of those polled did not know about the link between obesity and some cancers such as breast and bowel cancer.

Nuffield Health questioned 3,100 people about their health and well-being - including about perceptions of their weight.

Half believed themselves to be overweight and  six per cent thought they were obese.

But body mass index (BMI) tests revealed that 17% were clinically obese
 - classed as such when they have a BMI score over 30 - and three per 
cent measured as 'morbidly obese', with a BMI of 40 or over.

The charity said that there is a "clear misconception" over what weight is considered to be obese.

If
 the figures are extrapolated, this means around six million people in 
the UK could be at risk by not recognising that they are obese and the 
associated health risks, a charity spokeswoman said.

Around
 two-thirds were unaware about obese people's increase risk of liver 
disease or osteoarthritis. And 46 per cent were not aware about the link between
 obesity and stroke.

Commenting on the report, Dr Hilary Jones told Daybreak: 'People like Helen don't want to indetify the truth in the stats.

'She says she is happy, but I think she could be happier.'

He added that a third of morbidly obese people suffer from depression.

He said to Ms Dee: 'I do think you could be happier. Do you think you could be happier if you were thinner?'

She replied: 'I really don't think it
 would make any difference. A few years ago, I was five or six stone 
lighter and I felt no different then to now.

'But when I was dieting I was miserable. I love food - if there is chocolate or an apple, I will take a chocolate.

'I'm not saying an apple will make me unhappy, but a chocolate will make me happier.

When
 asked is she was concerned about the impact of her weight on her 
health, she said:'I have heard it time again, not just from doctors but 
from my family and friends.

'But
 do you know what? Everything that we like or are addicted to - and not 
just food, but drugs, cigarettes, whatever - someone has something to 
say. It's very easy to jump on the bandwagon.'
