A coroner stunned an inquest into a honeymooner’s death by asking her husband if he had been involved.

Kristy Cadman-Jones, 27, died of a drugs overdose at a luxury hotel in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, towards the end of a month-long tour of the Far East with Damian, 31.

At the time of her death in January it was suggested that she had suffered a heart attack.

However, the inquest heard yesterday that she was killed by a huge amount of pure heroin.

Mr Cadman-Jones, a solicitor, claimed the couple had been offered what 
they thought was cocaine by two travellers they met in a bar that night.
 He ‘suspected’ that his wife, a recruitment agency branch manager, took
 some.

The inquest was also told that within hours of the bride’s death someone
 had attempted to make a claim on her life insurance policy.

In extraordinary scenes, coroner Donald Coutts-Wood quizzed Mr 
Cadman-Jones about the circumstances surrounding her death and pointed 
out inconsistencies in his statements.

He asked: ‘Were you in any way involved with others in any intention to end your wife’s life?’

Mr Cadman-Jones denied this – and said he did not know who contacted 
Zurich, the insurance company with whom he and his wife held life 
insurance policies.

Mr Coutts-Wood also asked Mr Cadman-Jones why he was ‘so desperate’ to 
have his wife’s body embalmed within 48 hours, explaining that the 
process could hamper toxicology tests.

Mr Cadman-Jones told the hearing 
at Leicester Town Hall – where the couple were married – that he made 
the decision so his wife could ‘say goodbye to her mother’, who did not 
fly out to Cambodia.

The inquest heard that when he filled in a claim form relating to his 
wife’s life insurance policy later in the year, he put the cause of 
death as ‘heart and cardiovascular failure’ – despite the fact he had 
received a report from the post-mortem examination outlining the cause 
of death as morphine and codeine toxicity as a result of taking heroin.

Mr Cadman-Jones said he had completed the form several months earlier 
and had not checked it before sending it off.

The inquest also heard how Mr Cadman-Jones’s first statement to the 
authorities did not mention drugs, but a later one described how a pair 
of ‘experienced travellers’ had offered him and his wife cocaine on the 
night of her death.

Mr Cadman-Jones said he did not see his wife taking drugs that night, 
but admitted she took them ‘once in a blue moon’.

He declined to answer 
when asked if he had himself used drugs in the past.

Recording an open verdict, Mr Coutts-Wood said he did not find Mr 
Cadman-Jones’ contradictory evidence ‘credible’, but explained that he 
did not have the evidence to record a verdict of unlawful killing.

Leicestershire Police said: ‘There is no information to support a homicide inquiry at this time.’
