Motorists drawing guns to secure petrol, residents looking through rubbish bags for food and pensioners shivering in sewage-swamped homes.

The scenes that smack of Third World misery are the fate of New Yorkers in the wake of superstorm Sandy.

Five days after disaster struck America’s Atlantic coast, New York is suffering the sort of social breakdown that followed Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005.

Queues: Hundreds of New Yorkers waiting in line at a Brooklyn bus stop yesterday

Neverending: Thousands of people wait to board city buses into Manhattan in Brooklyn, New York City as limited public transit returns

Shuttled for shuttles: The limited public transport system means all commuters have to resort to buses as no trains run from Brooklyn to Manhattan after tunnels were flooded by the hurricane's storm surge

Anger is building as supplies run short in the densely-populated area.

Power is still out for more than 3.8million homes and businesses – causing everything from food stores to petrol distribution centres to close.

Families and pensioners have been seen in Manhattan’s East Village and wealthy SoHo sifting through rubbish dumpsters, opening bags of expired food thrown out by supermarkets and shops.

Water is also scarce – with the threat of sewage contamination making existing supplies risky. Some residents have taken to filling up bottles and pans from street fire hydrants.

In the outer boroughs – particularly 
storm-ravaged Staten Island, where 19 have died – and coastal areas of 
Brooklyn and Queens, residents say they have been forgotten by officials
 who are focusing on Manhattan.

‘We are scavenging for food like animals,’ said Coney Island resident Jeffery Francis.

‘We are in a crisis and no one will help us. Look at us. We are misery. We are Katrina.’

Hunt: People look for salvageable food discarded from a flooded store in Coney Island, New York, as anger mounts over lack of relief supplies

Desperate: With no food supplies and no supermarkets open, residents are forced to pick through bin bags of discarded food

Albert Miller, 58, a fellow resident of the Brooklyn seaside resort where many apartments now smell of sewage and mould, said there was no food anywhere.

‘One person found a sandwich and we split it four ways,’ he said. ‘I’m just happy to be alive. We are praying a lot right now. Praying for help.’

Coney Island is one of the neighbourhoods worst hit by looting. At least 41 people have been arrested across New York for stealing food, alcohol and electronics goods, prompting a dramatic increase in the number of police patrols.

Heated: Local residents argue for their place in line while waiting to get fuel at a gas station in Queens

Frayed tempers: Armed police tackle violence at a gas station in Brooklyn, after one customer accused another of cutting in line

Don't bother: A "no gas" sign is seen in front of a vehicle that ran out of fuel in front of a gas station in Staten Island

Take a seat: Patient customers, some with their own food and drink, wait their turn

Can you believe it? Cans and even buckets lie waiting to be filled with gas

In Manhattan, muggers have reportedly been snatching Apple iPhones from people who were using them as torches in the unlit streets.

‘There’s just strange people roaming around the buildings in the dark,’ said 75-year-old Irma Batista, who lives in public housing in the East Village.

Mile-long queues of cars are forming at petrol stations that have either the power or the petrol to stay open. Tempers have flared and, in Queens, an motorist was arrested for pulling a gun on a driver who had objected to him queue-jumping.

Destroyed: Sheila and Dominic Traina hug in front of their Staten Island home which was demolished by Sandy

Salvaging treasures: Members of the Traina family sort through photographs and other personal items that they have managed to find in the rubble that was their home on the south side of Staten Island

A man rinses his hands in flood water while cleaning out a house in a hard-hit neighbor hood in Staten Island yesterday

Sean Bailey, 55, allegedly told his adversary: ‘If you don’t pull back, you’re not getting gas tonight.’

Nearly two thirds of the service stations in New York City and New Jersey, which was also devastated by Sandy, remained shut yesterday. ‘It’s like Mogadishu at the gas stations. If police aren’t there, people are going to get shot, said Dennis Roach, a commercial diver who has been helping with the repairs to New York’s damaged docks.

‘People are literally screaming at each other, pushing and shoving.’

Despite the chaos, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has said the city’s marathon will still go ahead tomorrow. The race, which last year drew 47,000 runners and is one of the world’s largest, begins in Staten Island and ends in Central Park. Some runners have promised to head to the start line and spend the day volunteering rather than racing.

The mayor has been warned all efforts should go toward relieving the misery of the homeless and hungry.
