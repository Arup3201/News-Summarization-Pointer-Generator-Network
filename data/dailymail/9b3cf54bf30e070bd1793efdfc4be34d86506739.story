It was at the center of a controversial Rolling Stone article about a brutal gang rape.

But that didn't stop a wave of spring rush hopefuls from attending the newly-reinstated University of Virginia fraternity Phi Kappa Psi's open-house event on Thursday, according to reports.

During the event, the group's centrally-located house was apparently 'crowded and lively', with hordes of undergraduates hoping to impress the fraternity's members and leaders.

One UVA freshman, who attended the open house but wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I can definitely affirm it was crowded and lively. It was the last house I hit and I still had to wait in line.'

Meanwhile, a female freshman said that as she walked through campus during the spring sorority rush on Thursday, it appeared that Phi Psi's house 'was the busiest frat I saw that night'.

In an email to New York magazine on Friday, fraternity president, Stephen Scipione, confirmed: 'We had a good crowd last night'. But he added: 'It’s far too early to judge rush this year.'

On Monday, police announced that they had been unable to confirm that an alleged gang rape occurred at Phi Psi's house, as described in the controversial Rolling Stone article.

The story detailed the graphic claims of an unnamed UVA junior who said she was gang-raped by seven men in an apparent initiation ritual at the fraternity in 2012.

But in an email to the Associated Press, Charlottesville Police Captain Gary Pleasants said: 'The statement reads that we did not find any substantive basis to confirm the allegations occurred at Phi Kappa Psi, not that we said the assault did not occur. We are still investigating.'

Following Monday's verdict, the school declared it had reinstated the group and its activities after consulting with the police force about the findings of their investigation.

Speaking about Thursday's open-house event, Matt, a freshman who did not rush Phi Psi, said he thought it would have been unfair if the house had been 'deserted' due to the allegations.

'I personally didn’t avoid it because of that. There could have been people that would have because of that, but if they could vocalize that, it’d be an unpopular opinion,' he said. 

He added that his friend, who had rushed the fraternity, had told him the place was 'packed'.

After the Rolling Stone article was published in November, the magazine issued a statement noting discrepancies in the story and apologizing to those involved in the fraternity.

Despite its apology, campus and fraternity leaders were put under pressure to adopt reforms as protesters gathered outside Phi Psi's house, with many calling for the end of all Greek Life. 

The building was gratified with statements like 'UVA Center for Rape Studies' and 'Suspend Us!'. Fearing for their safety, most fraternity members fled the house, booking hotel rooms.

Meanwhile, police launched an investigation into the alleged assault at the request of the university. 

'We knew that the Rolling Stone story was not true,' said 22-year-old fraternity member David Fontenot, a senior from McLean, Virginia, recalling the aftermath of the article's publication.

On Monday, Cpt Pleasants said that although university officials were not presented a written report on the police investigation into Phi Psi, they were updated via a telephone call.

'We just didn't find any reasons to keep sanctions on that particular fraternity right now,' he told the AP in a telephone interview.

While the school temporarily suspended fraternities' and sororities' social activities, administrators vowed to take an extensive look at improving safety on campus.

Phi Psi was the first fraternity to agree to new rules, some of which address alcohol distribution at parties. Officials want to make it less likely for drugs to be slipped into drinks.

'We believe that in the midst of this ordeal, there is an opportunity to move forward with important safety improvements,' Mr Scipione, a 21-year-old junior from Richmond, said last week.

'This has prompted us to take a closer look at ourselves and what role organizations like ours may play in this problem. It's opened all of our eyes to the problem of sexual assault.

'Now it's time to do something about it. As a fraternity, we are going to continue discussing that need in the coming weeks.'

Other fraternities had a Friday deadline to sign new agreements with the university that were developed by the school's Inter-Fraternity Council in a bid to keep students at parties safer.

Among them: Kegs of beer and pre-made mixes of liquor and punch will be banned; beer must be served in closed cans, and food and water must be made available. 

The female freshman who walked past Phi Psi's fraternity house on Thursday night said the absence of strong pre-mixed drinks will likely make parties less popular for young female students.

Because of this, 'I think there’s going to be more pregaming,' she told New York magazine.
