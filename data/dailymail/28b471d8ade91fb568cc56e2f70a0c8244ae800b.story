Inexplicable: Friends and family say Celina Cass is the last person they would expect to run away

As the search for missing 11-year-old Celina Cass enters its fifth day, police are now turning their attentions towards her computer as it has been revealed that her stepfather has a troubled past filled with allegations of criminal behaviour and mental illness.

Celina vanished without a trace from her bedroom on Monday, where she was last seen playing on her computer around 9pm. The next morning she was gone.

Police are desperately searching for her and plan to question everyone in the small town of Stewartstown, New Hampshire, which is just a mile away from the Canadian border.

Last night the stepfather of the shy fifth-grader, Wendell Noyes, said the family were 'grieving' - as a friend issued a statement on their behalf with a direct plea to Celina, saying 'we will not stop searching for you until you are back in our arms'.

It has emerged that Noyes, 47, was involuntarily committed in 2003 after being diagnosed with schizophrenia and arrested for threatening an ex-girlfriend.

According to court records obtained by ABC, the woman said Noyes broke into her home while she and 
her two children slept, picked up her mattress and slammed it down.

She 
also told authorities that he threatened to throw her down the 
stairs.

At the time, Judge Richard Hampe ruled Noyes was
incompetent to stand trial, writing that the man's mental illness created 'a
potentially serious likelihood of danger to himself and others'.

A forensic examiner said Noyes was a paranoid schizophrenic, who most likely developed the condition while he was in the Air Force.

Celina's family have said that she would never run away from home or leave with a stranger.

Speaking yesterday  from the motel in 
Canaan, Vermont, where he and Celina's mother are staying, Noyes told the Boston 
Herald: 'Right now, we’re in the process of grieving.'

At a press conference last night, a friend broke down as she read out a statement on behalf of Celina's family.

She said: 'Our beautiful Celina is a 
happy child who brings much love and joy into the lives of those who 
know her. Her safe and speedy return is our sole priority and focus.

'We remain hopeful and vigilant and 
trust in the investigative abilities of the authorities involved. We 
pray that our little girl is returned home soon.

'We plead for answers and ask if you 
saw or know anything at all, however insignificant you may think your 
information is, that you come forward now without hesitation and share 
it with our investigators.

'And Celina, if you can hear this 
now, please know how much we love and we miss you. You are in our 
thoughts and in our prayers. We will not stop searching for you until 
you are back in our arms.'

Her disappearance has shaken the small town, with some fearing that she may have been taken out of the country.

State police from New Hampshire and 
Vermont, along with FBI child abduction specialists and U.S. border 
patrol, scoured the area Thursday, even sending agents as far as New 
York and Virginia.

Investigators say they have little to go on, with no signs of an abduction or a struggle but no sign she ran away either.

Jane Young, New Hampshire's assistant attorney general, said they were going to talk to every person in town.

'Every house, every individual in the neighbourhood is being spoken to,' she said.

She added: 'We just continue to look 
for her with all available assets. We don’t have any evidence at this 
juncture to indicate that this is a criminal investigation.”

Investigators are painstakingly going through 225 tips, some of which have come from as far away as North Carolina and Illinois.

More than 100 searchers are now 
involved in the manhunt for the 11-year-old girl, including the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The town of just 800 people 
is only a mile from Canada.

So far, this extraordinary effort has turned up nothing.

Kiernan Ramsey of the FBI's New 
Hampshire office told ABC: 'We're using advanced techniques from 
aviation to canines and the like. We are hopeful some positive outcome 
could result.'

He added: 
'Some have made a lot of debate as to whether this is a missing persons 
case or an abduction. I will tell you, from the FBI's perspective, 
labelling of this case does not matter, when it comes to the resources 
that we are bringing to bear.'

The front lawn of the home where 
Celina lives with her mother, stepfather and 13-year-old sister has 
been turned into a shrine, with candles, stuffed animals and notes 
to the missing fifth grader.

Community members outside the home are flagging down cars and handing out flyers with Celina's image.

'It's a big world and she's a small 
girl and she's only 11. She doesn't know how to handle herself,' said 
Stewartstown resident Shahannah Fuller.

Celina's mother and stepfather have not spoken to the television media, and have requested 'absolute privacy'.

On Wednesday an extensive land search was scaled back, and police trawled the Connecticut River using two boats.

They lowered the waterway 
so helicopters could scour it from the air, while officers desperately 
searching an area within a half-mile radius of her home.

Friends
and neighbours have been holding candlelit vigils for Celina every 
night since she disappeared, as they desperately pray for her safe 
return. They gather around a framed photograph of the schoolgirl on a 
picnic table, surrounded by candles.

Friends say Celina was the last person they'd expect to run away.

Fighting back tears and holding a lit
candle at the gathering, family friend Rebecca Goodrum said:
'She never went anywhere without her mom or sister.'

She said: 'She was beautiful. She was the light of everything.'

Another, Kayla Baglio, said: 'She is 
very shy. If she doesn't know you, she'd look at her sister to see if it
was OK to talk to you.

One of Celina's schoolfriends, 
11-year-old Makayla Riendeau, said she was very athletic and a stickler 
about getting her school work done on time.

She said: 'She's a very good friend, and she never lets anybody down.

Shannon Towles, who owns a mini-mart on Route 3, said her disappearance had shaken the town, which has just 800 residents.

She said: 'It's creepy. Things like 
this don't happen here. I know that's kind of a tired phrase. I'm an 
overprotective mom as it is. Now it's going to be way worse.'

Mrs Towles said Celina wasn't the type 
of girl to hitchhike or run away. She said: 'She's just a little girl 
and she's a nice little girl.'

Celina attends Stewartstown Community School, where she is one of just 85 pupils.

The
district superintendent described her as popular and well-liked, and 
said six counsellors were on hand to help students cope with her 
disappearance.

Mrs Towles said her daughter, Echo, 
had asked her whether she thought Celina was still alive.

She said: 'How
do I answer that question? And do I want to? I don't want to think 
about it, but I pray every second that she is.'

Friends
and neighbours have spent the last four days posting flyers showing her 
smiling face on every available lamppost and tree trunk.

On Thursday police searched the woods 
behind an apartment building about a mile north of the town. They 
carried bags and boxes, but it was unclear if they collected anything.

Later
officers went into Celina's home, then stretched yellow crime scene 
tape around it before posting a uniformed officer outside.

Then
plain clothes police officers wearing purple rubber gloves surrounded a
red pick-up truck parked across the street from the house, taking 
photographs and looking inside.

Lieutenant Douglas Gralenski, a state
Fish and Game Department official helping to search the river, said: 
'Honestly, we don't know where else we can look. There's so much that's 
unknown.'

He said: 'It's not a deep river. You'd be hard-pressed to find six to eight feet in 
most of it in that area. When we had it drawn down, it was 
exceptionally low.'

The investigation has now been passed on to the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office.
