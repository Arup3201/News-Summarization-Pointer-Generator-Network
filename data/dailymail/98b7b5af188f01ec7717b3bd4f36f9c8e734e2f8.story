Alex Salmond today insisted that Scotland is 'on the cusp of making history' by voting for independence in next week's referendum.

The First Minister claimed that 'Scotland will vote Yes' despite the setbacks which the independence campaign has suffered in the past two days.

His speech was met with applause from a gathering of foreign journalists - but the excitement seemed to be too much for actor Brian Cox, a prominent supporter of independence, who was pictured falling asleep during the talk.

Speech: Alex Salmond today insisted that Scotland was 'on the cusp' of declaring independence

Snooze: Pro-independence actor Brian Cox fell asleep during Mr Salmond's press conference in Edinburgh

Mr Salmond's press conference in Edinburgh came a day after the latest poll showed that 53 per cent of Scots oppose independence, excluding those who have yet to make up their minds.

In addition, a number of financial firms announced that they would move their headquarters out of Scotland in the event of a 'Yes' vote next Thursday, while oil giants issued warnings over the future of the North Sea's reserves.

'Scotland is on the cusp of making history,' Mr Salmond said. 'The eyes of the world are upon Scotland. And what the world is seeing is an articulate, peaceful, energised debate.

'Scotland will vote Yes next Thursday and they will vote Yes because last minute, cobbled up promises from the No campaign which unravel at the slightest scrutiny will not fool anyone in this country and neither will the blatant bullying and intimidation of the Westminster Government.

'The No campaign is in terminal decline. In contrast a Yes vote is the opportunity of a lifetime. An opportunity to build a fairer more prosperous country.'

Poll: The First Minister claimed he was confident of victory in next Thursday's vote

During the press conference, intended to mark the 17th anniversary of Scotland voting for a devolved Parliament in 1997, Mr Salmond said that the country's people had 're-discovered national self-confidence' during the referendum campaign.

'It has been a process of national empowerment,' he said. 'As a country we have re-discovered national self-confidence. As a nation, we are finding our voice.

'Our message to the people of Scotland is this - for the first time in Scottish history, on the 18th September we, the people, hold our destiny in our own hands.

'We shall not wake up on the 19th of September having given it away. We shall wake up knowing that we did the right thing. Wake up to a lifetime of feeling confident in ourselves and in our country.'

During Mr Salmond's speech, Mr Cox, 68, could be seen looking sleepy and nodding off.

The actor, who has appeared in films such as Manhunter, Troy and X-Men, is a vocal supporter of Scottish independence, claiming that the legacy of the Labour party is best represented by the 'Yes' campaign.

Claim: Mr Salmond said that most world leaders backed Scottish independence because they had not spoken out against it

Exceptions: Barack Obama and Tony Abbott have both openly opposed the break-up of the Union

As well as urging Scots to vote 'Yes', Mr Salmond insisted that he had the support of other world leaders who have not spoken out in favour of the Union.

The Foreign Office asked every world leader to back the UK, according to Mr Salmond, but only a few have done so - including US President Barack Obama and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

Responding to a question from an Australian journalist, Mr Salmond said: 'I think we've got very substantial support on the international stage.

'Given the UK Government asked every world leader to make a statement of support for their position, and given that only a handful have obliged and done so, I think we have to conclude that other world leaders said "nein" or "no", or whatever language they were speaking in, to that request from the Foreign Office.

'So I think in these particular circumstances we are entitled to count up all of the world leaders in the great democracies of Europe and elsewhere who obviously declined the Foreign Office Prime Ministerial invitation to say something, and conclude that they therefore did not share that opinion.' 

He said he had received several hundred letters from Scots-Australians disassociating themselves from Mr Abbott's views, and suggested it could backfire for the Prime Minister at the ballot box.
