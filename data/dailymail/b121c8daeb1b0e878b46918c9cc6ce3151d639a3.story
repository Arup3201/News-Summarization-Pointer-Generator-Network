An experimental drug could help millions of women across the world combat cellulite 

An experimental drug could help combat the dreaded cellulite that plagues millions of women across the world, new research has revealed.

A trial carried out in the U.S. by Auxilium Pharmaceuticals has shown a 'significant improvement' in the appearance of 'orange peel' skin on the thighs and buttocks of the women taking part.

Cellulite is a term to describe lumpy, dimpled flesh on the thighs, buttocks and abdomen, and is most common in adolescent and adult women.

The new study could provide a ray of hope for those women left feeling self-conscious by the condition, which is not serious but can be unsightly. 

There are currently no treatments for cellulite in the U.S. that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   

The study involved 150 women between the ages of 18 and 45.

Each participant received up to three treatment sessions of the drug Xiaflex (CCH) or a placebo. 

The treatment sessions were around 21 days apart and up to 12 injections were administered into the dimpled skin on the buttock or thigh.

The findings revealed 68 per cent of those women receiving the high to mid dosage of the drug reported being 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with their cellulite treatment.

That compared to just 34 per cent of the patients given the placebo. 

Cellulite is a localised metabolic disorder of tissue under the skin.

It affects between 85 to 98 per cent women, of all ethnicities.

The condition can involve the loss of elasticity or shrinking of collagen cords, called 'septae', that attach the skin to the muscle layers below.

When fat in cellulite prone areas swells and expands, the septae tether the skin, which causes surface dimpling characteristic of cellulite.

Xiaflex works by targeting and breaking those collagen tethers with the goal of reducing the skin dimpling and potentially resulting in the smoothing of the skin. 

Adrian Adams, chief executive and president of Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, said: 'We continue to be encouraged by the promising and positive results of our program.

'We believe these data establish proof of concerpt for CCH as a potential treatment for cellulite and enable Auxilium to pursue our development and regulatory strategy to most efficiently and effectively advance this exciting program.

'We look forward to initiating a planned Phase 2b clinical trial in the second quarter of 2015.'  

A trial carried out by Auxilium Pharmaceuticals in the U.S. tested the drug Xiaflex on a study-group of 150 women aged 18 to 45. Of those receiving high to mid doses, 68 per cent reported being 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with their treatment. Pictured is a diagram showing the difference between normal skin and cellulite

James Tursi, chief medical officer of the company, added: 'These data have exceeded our expectations, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in cellulite as measured by both physicians and patients.

'These are challenging endpoints and ones that we believe are critical in the context of regulatory consideration. 

'We are continuing to analyse these exciting data and will be gathering key opinion leader and regulatory input and look forward to publishing and presenting our findings in peer-reviewed venues in the future.' 

Despite multiple therapeutic approaches for the attempted treatment of cellulite, there are no FDA-approved treatments and little scientific evidence that any current treatments are beneficial. 

Xiaflex is a medicine manufactured from biological sources, that already has FDA approval, as well as approval in Europe, Canada and Australia for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture - a progressive hand disease that prevents the patient from straightening and properly using their fingers.

It is also FDA approved to treat men with curvature of the penis, a condition known as Peyronie's disease.
