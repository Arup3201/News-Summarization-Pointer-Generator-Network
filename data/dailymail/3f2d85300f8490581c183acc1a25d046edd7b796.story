This is the moment a student gave his mother the surprise of her life by telling her about the degree he had secretly studied for over four years just minutes before he graduated.

Support worker Liam Blair kept the fact he was studying for a psychology degree at Dundee University from his mother Rhonda, constructing an entire fictional identity to cover his tracks.

The 31-year-old eventually came clean after taking his mother out to lunch and changing into his graduation gown in a pub bathroom before revealing he was graduating that afternoon.

Shock: This is the moment Rhonda Blair, 56, learned that her son Liam, 31, had been secretly studying for a degree, and was about to graduate

Secretive: Support worker Liam Blair kept the fact he was studying for a psychology degree at Dundee University from his mother, and constructed an entire fictional identity to cover his tracks

Proud moment: Ms Blair cries in disbelief as her son, dressed in his graduation gown, reveals his big secret

Mr Blair's confession was captured on video camera, as was his mum's shocked, but delighted expression.

The secrecy started with a decision not to tell Ms Blair that he was applying for the course at Dundee University.

But as his studies continued he decided not to tell her, and as the situation snowballed Mr Blair found himself living a bizarre double life - even telling his mother he was working at a fish factory in Perth.

'Originally it was just until I was accepted but then it just went on,' he said. 

Plot: Mr Blair filmed the surprise on YouTube, and the clip starts with him explaining how he had kept his degree a secret for the past four years

Moment of truth: Mr Blair then walks into the bar in his gown, and tells his mother it is his graduation day

Disbelief: Ms Blair initially did not believe her son, and thought he had been playing a joke on her

'The lies got more convoluted. I said that I was working, in many different jobs, and staying in a hotel in Perth.'

Mr Blair said he struggled to hide the truth from his mother, particularly when she arranged to meet him in Perth - as in reality he was living in a flat in Dundee - or asked him questions about his fictional colleagues.

After four years of pretence Mr Blair, of Crieff, came clean to his mother on his graduation day last month and posted footage of the big reveal on YouTube.

He had taken her out on the pretence that it was a birthday lunch, before going to the bathroom and returning in his gown.

All smiles: Mr Blair embraces his mother - who thought her son was working in a fish factory in Perth

In the clip, which has been viewed by more than 1,000 people, Mr Blair can be seen putting on his graduating gown as his mother waits in the bar.

He tells the camera: 'Ok, I’m just about to reveal to my mother that I’m 
graduating today, and I’ve been at university for four years, and she 
doesn’t know a damn thing about it, so here we go.'

Then he leaves the toilet stall, enters the bar, and tells his mother: 'I’m graduating today!'

But his mother, who thought he had borrowed the gown from a friend to wear as a prank, tells her son: 'I don’t know what you’re talking about.'

Hard work: Mr Blair with his mother at his graduation ceremony at Dundee University

As Mr Blair reaffirms to his mother that he is graduating, in disbelief she gestures to others in the pub and says: 'So this is all a set up - are you kidding me, Liam?'

Mr Blair said he kept the secret for 'various reasons that are personal to me' but said the thought of his mum’s face when he told her the truth helped keep get stuck into studying.

'I didn’t expect to be accepted on to the course,' he said.

'I only got one Higher at school.

'The thought of my mum’s reaction when I when I was to reveal it to her ended up acting as a strong motivator for me to see the course to the end.

'It was meticulously planned and was a struggle but in the end It couldn’t have gone better.'

Mr Blair chose to study psychology as a number of people close to him had suffered from mental health problems and now his degree has helped him secure a job as a support worker for the Scottish Association of Mental Health.

His former craft and design teacher at Crieff High School, John McGarry, was in on the secret and provided one of the references Mr Blair needed for his university application.

Mr McGarry often met Ms Blair at the recycling centre where he now works and found it hard to maintain his vow of silence.

'Crieff is a small place and everyone tends to know each others’ business,' said Mr McGarry.

'Liam was in contact with me throughout the course and I never thought he would manage to keep the secret for four years.

'She hadn’t a clue about what he was doing until the last month when, under the pretext of him treating her to lunch, he sprung the surprise that it was his graduation.'

Ms Blair said tonight that her son had tricked her into going to Dundee, telling her that they would be celebrating her birthday a week early.

University: Mr Blair's younger sister Dawn Menzies, 24, had been in on the secret because half way through his course she was also accepted at Dundee University where she is studying community health nursing

She also revealed that Mr Blair's younger sister Dawn Menzies, 24, had been in on the secret because half way through his course she was also accepted at Dundee University where she is studying community health nursing.

'He’d told me he was working in a fish factory in Perth,' said Ms Blair.

'I think the reason he didn’t tell me at the start was that he’d been to college before for three years after he left school, but dropped out to concentrate on his music - he’s a very talented electric guitarist.

'So when he tried again he kept it a secret just so he could see my face. It worked - I was absolutely shocked.'

Liam’s grandmother, Agnes Garrow, 78, said: 'Rhonda was amazed - for four years she’d been saying "all that education, and he’s wasting it working in a fish factory".

'It was a big shock, and a lovely surprise - no doubt about it.'
