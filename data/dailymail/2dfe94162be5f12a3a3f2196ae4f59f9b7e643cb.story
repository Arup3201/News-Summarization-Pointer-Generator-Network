A teenage marksman touted as a future Olympic champion was airlifted to hospital after accidentally shooting himself in the head.

Blaise Fenn, 15, was shooting rabbits in the Kent countryside when he accidentally blasted himself in the head with a shotgun, police revealed today.

The junior shooting champion had been reported missing before he was discovered lying in a field near his home with a gunshot wound to the right side of his head.

Accident: Blaise Fenn was transferred to St George's Hospital in South London, where he is understood to remain in a stable condition

Blaise, who was conscious when he was discovered in Speldhurst, near Tunbridge Wells, at around 9pm on Monday, was treated by paramedics before being airlifted to Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton.

The 15-year-old was later transferred to St George's Hospital in South London, where he remains in a stable condition.

The young marksman was crowned Junior Topham at Tonbridge School's rifle championships in September last year, and also plays rugby for Tonbridge Juddians club.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'A 15-year-old boy has been airlifted to hospital after accidentally shooting himself in the head.

'The boy had been shooting rabbits on land at his family home in Speldhurst near Tunbridge Wells when the incident occurred.

'The boy had been reported missing at 8.30pm after failing to return to the family home which sparked a search operation by officers.

'He was found shortly after 9pm with a gunshot wound to his head.'

The spokesman said the teenager was airlifted to hospital to receive treatment.

'The shotgun he was using was found nearby and has been made safe,' he added.

The Rev Douglas Wren, vicar at St Mary's Church in the village of Speldhurst, said: 'The family live close to me. Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

'They're clearly a family in distress at the moment and we will be praying for them.

'I really know little more about the details of how the accident happened as I haven't spoken to the family yet,' he said.
