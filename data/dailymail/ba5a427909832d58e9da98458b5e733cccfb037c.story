Six singles have agreed to legally tie the knot with a total stranger for Married at First Sight, a new reality series.

Billed as an 'extreme social experiment,' the show will follow the stories of three newlywed couples paired up by four experts: All applicants were evaluated by a sexologist, a spiritualist, a psychologist and a sociologist, who narrowed down hundreds of possible matches.

In the premiere, which airs tonight on the FYI network, the participants will meet their future spouses for the first time - as they walk down the aisle.

Taking the plunge: Jamie Otis and Jason Carrion, both 27, are two of the strangers who tie the knot on Married at First Sight, a new reality series

One cast member says she took the plunge after struggling to find a man ready to commit.

'In
 New York City, I feel like the guys are primarily just players until 
they’re hitting their late 30s,' Jamie Otis, a 27-year-old nurse from Harlem, told the New York Post, adding, 'It’s tough to find guys who are serious.'

Jason Carrion, a 27-year-old EMT 
from Brooklyn, also looks for love on the series, which is based on a Danish program of the 
same name.

Perfect strangers: Monet, 33, and Vaughn, 30, are also part of the 'extreme social experiment'

Love is blind: Cortney, 26, and Doug, 31, are two others preparing to marry people they've never met

The
 men and women, ages 26 to 33, are all from the Tri-State Area. After 
several weeks of married life, each couple must decide whether to stay 
together.

Other cast 
members include Cortney Hendrix, a 26-year-old makeup artist who performs in a 
burlesque troupe, Monet Bell, a 33-year-old product development manager, Vaughn Copeland, a 30-year-old field service technician, and Doug Hehner, a 31-year-old 
commercial sales rep and lifeguard.

Sexologist
 Dr Logan Levkoff, one of the specialists featured on the show, 
confirms that each union is 'a real marriage — not just one made for 
television' in an interview with Jezebel.  

Matchmaker, matchmaker: Dr Pepper Schwartz,  Greg Epstein, Dr Logan Levkoff and  Dr Joseph Cilona paired up three couples who marry sight unseen

'This experiment seeks to determine whether social science can play a role in marital success,' she says.

'If we can offer a new way to find a connection (and a long-lasting one), imagine the possibilities!'

Australia's Nine Network has confirmed to Daily Mail Australia it is planning a local production of the series.
