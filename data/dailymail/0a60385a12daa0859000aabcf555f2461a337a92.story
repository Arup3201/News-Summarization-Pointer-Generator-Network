Former Chelsea assistant manager Henk ten Cate has backed Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal to become a success at Old Trafford but insists his fellow countryman needs time. 

The Dutchman has been criticised throughout his first season in England for constantly tinkering with his side's set up and for failing to get the best out of high-profile players such as Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie.

Manchester United, who crashed out of the FA Cup at home to Arsenal on Monday, face a tough battle to qualify for next season's Champions League as just two points now separate the Red Devils in fourth from fifth-placed Liverpool.

Ten Cate concedes Van Gaal's side have been below-par but is confident Van Gaal will be able to turn the club's fortunes around. 

'I know him well and he is the kind of guy who doesn't just go for results, he wants his teams to play good football. He has proved that in the past,' Ten Cate told talkSPORT.

'Right now at Manchester United it is not that good. The way they are playing is absolutely not good. But it is not the style of Van Gaal.

'You have to give him time because, for me, he is one of the best coaches there is. I worked closely with him for one year when I was going through the stages to get my coaching licence. I saw what he was doing and the only thing he has to do is get used to the way of playing in England.

'If the owners of the club gave him that much confidence and that much money to spend, it is not a good thing to say goodbye after one season because it is starting to become his team.

'He needs a little more time but I am almost positive that he is going to surprise Britain with his [style of] football.' 

Van Gaal has spent more than £150million since replacing David Moyes as Manchester United's manager
