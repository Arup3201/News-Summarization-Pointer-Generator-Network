A lorry driver who blacked out after an uncontrollable coughing fit drove over a car and killed its four occupants without realising.

After his truck stopped  100 yards away on a golf course, Owen Davis told a motorist who stopped to help: ‘I’m just pleased I haven’t  hit anybody.’

Mr Davis, 42, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving but was later told he would not be prosecuted after his story was backed up by medical tests that showed he had a whooping cough infection.

Tragedy: One-year-old Destiny Reed is held by her 18-year-old mother Natalie. They both died when the car they where travelling, in a Renault Megan Scenic, was hit head on by a lorry in County Durham

Robert Reed, 75, his wife Margaret, 
74, their one-year-old great-granddaughter Destiny and her mother 
Natalie Simpson, 18, died in the collision between his Renault Scenic 
and Mr Owen’s Volvo lorry in April last year.

The
trucker sobbed yesterday as an inquest heard how his lorry-load of 
Tarmac went over Mr Reed’s people carrier, through a hedge, up a bank, 
and on to the golf course near Seaham, County Durham, while he was 
unconscious at the wheel.

Mr
Davis told the inquest in Crook: ‘I was coughing. I tried to get a 
breath in. I started to panic. There’s no lay-by, I’m going to have to 
park in the road and the next thing I remember is peace and quiet.’

Mr
Davis, who is married with two sons, said he remembered in detail the 
moments leading up to the crash on the 40mph road, adding: ‘I had the 
radio on, I was listening to Aha’s Take On Me and I was tapping my 
finger. My speed was increasing. On the clock I saw I was doing 46 and I
slowed down to 43.’

It was 
then he began to cough for about six seconds before he passed out.

Investigation: The accident scene where Natalie Simpson, 18, her baby daughter, Destiny Reed, and Destiny's great-grandfather Robert Reed, 75, died

Damaged lorry: Durham Coroner Andrew Tweddle returned verdicts in all four cases of accidental death

He 
added: ‘I got out of the lorry, I was dazed, I didn’t know what had 
happened. I had a pain in my stomach where I had hit the steering wheel.
I wanted to lie down.’

Loss: Sean Reed, at the inquest today into the deaths of his baby daughter, partner and grandparents

Someone then told him his 15-ton lorry had hit a
car. When Mr Davis asked what had happened to the other driver he was 
told: ‘Yeah, yeah, he’s fine. He’s getting sorted out now.’

It was only later at Sunderland Royal Infirmary where he was being treated that police told him that four people had died.

Dr
Nigel Stout checked Mr Davis’s blood for whooping cough after hearing 
that his teenage son had also passed out during a coughing fit. The test
revealed an infection had been present. In a rare condition known as 
cough syncope, coughing can lower blood pressure, leading to 
unconsciousness.

Mr Reed, Destiny and her mother would have died almost instantly, Durham coroner Andrew Tweddle was told.

Mrs Reed, from Houghton-le-Spring, died later in hospital from multiple injuries.

A
driver following the lorry said it appeared Mr Davis had suffered a 
heart attack because he did not slow down for a bend immediately before 
the crash.

After the crash, 
an off-duty police officer who had been playing golf asked Mr Davis if 
he knew what he had hit. The trucker replied: ‘My chin.’

Paramedic
Angela Leybourn  said that when the officer told him he had collided 
with a car: ‘His eyes shot open and it was as if he was in shock and he 
said, “Is the driver all right?”’

Mr Tweddle returned four verdicts of accidental death.

After
the hearing, Julie Duggan, whose son Sean was Natalie’s partner and 
Destiny’s father, said: ‘I don’t know how he can live with himself.’

Accident: Robert Reed, 75, his wife Margaret, 74, their one-year-old great-granddaughter Destiny and her mother Natalie, 18, died in the collision between the Renault Scenic he was driving and a Volvo lorry

Accident: Mr Davis could remember in detail the moments leading up to the crash, which happened when he was on his way to lunch

Wreckage: The lorry went over Mr Reed's people carrier, through a hedge, up a bank, and ended up 100m away on a golf course, the inquest heard

Quick death: Mr Reed, his great-granddaughter Destiny and the baby's mother (pictured) would have died almost instantly, the coroner was told
