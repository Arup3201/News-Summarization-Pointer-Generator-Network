A driver turned his double-decker into an open top bus after taking it under a railway bridge that was too small for the vehicle.

The roof was ripped clean off the Number 12 service after the driver did not realise that buses were unable to fit under the bridge.

Fortunately there were no passengers on board when it hit the bridge in St George's Quay, Lancaster, but the driver was shaken by the incident.

Paramedics were called to the crash site at around 11.30am, while Lancashire Constabulary cordoned off the road before the 35ft roof could be fully removed.

A police spokesman said: 'We were alerted to the incident by reports claiming a bus's roof had been ripped "clean off".

'Emergency crews attended, thankfully there was no one on board and the driver was checked by paramedics.

'Structural engineers have looked at the bridge and believe there is no serious damage sustained to it.'

The driver, who described as being visibly shaken by the crash, now faces an investigation by operators Stagecoach, who insist he should not have been taking the route.

A spokesperson for Stagecoach said: 'At around 11.30am on Tuesday one of our vehicles struck a footbridge on Damside Street and St Georges Quay in Lancaster.

'There were no passengers on board at the time of the incident and no pedestrians were injured.

'The bus driver was treated at the scene for a shock. In addition, the bus has been severely damaged as a result of the incident.

Clean-up: Onlookers at the scene watched as emergency services began to clear up the debris

'Safety is our absolute priority. The bridge involved is not part of a planned bus route and we will now investigate what has happened on this occasion as a matter of urgency.'

Onlookers at the scene watched as emergency services began to clear up the debris.

Mark Gary, who works for radio station The Bay, said: 'The bridge is notorious for causing accidents and there's been a number of lorries and buses stuck there in the past.

'What he was doing driving there I'll never know.'
