Supermodel Eva Herzigova has spoken out about the new celebrity culture of sharing every aspect of their lives with fans through social media.

The 40-year-old Czech beauty said that she shuns sites such as Twitter and Facebook, claiming she ‘doesn’t go out selling herself’.

Speaking to Edit, Netaporter’s digital magazine, Eva talked about her incredible 24-year long career and how Hollywood’s sleazy side put her off an acting career.

In the shoot for the magazine Eva looks sophisticated and elegant in glamourous looks by designers like Balmain, Jason Wu,  Capitol Couture by Trish Summerville, Rag & Bone, Chloé and more.

In an exclusive interview, the supermodel discusses the longevity of her career which has spanned more than 24 years.

‘I’ve always worked hard and picked the right work.’ She continues, ‘In this society, where people sell their souls on Facebook and Twitter, I don’t go out there selling myself – I am very private.’

When asked about her most recent work – Marc Jacob’s final show for Louis Vuitton – she gushed about the show where she sat center of the runway on a revolving black carousel, dressed as a somber yet fabulous showgirl.

‘I saw Katie Grand, (editor and Marc Jacobs’ stylist and friend) on the Eurostar recently, and I told her I was still dazed from the beauty of the how,’ Herzigova says. 'She told me, ‘Of course you had to be there – it was for the Louis Vuitton girls.’ I have done four campaigns for them, so it was really touching.’

She reflects on her career turning point when she was featured in a Mario Testino and Carine Roitfeld editorial for The Face  saying: ‘For me, that shoot was a slap in the face to those who put me in the pin-up box. That was my jump from commercial to editorial.'

She continues, 'I could hear people gasp as they realized it was me.’

Despite her success,  more than 15 years ago, the fashion world almost lost Herzigova to Hollywood, she explains.

‘After doing a few films, I went to LA looking for an agent – and it was just pathetic,’ she remembers. ‘I met people who said, ‘Yes, we can talk about the movie over dinner.’ I was like, ‘What dinner? I can just read the script here.’

Having been thus exposed to the more sleazy side of Hollywood, Herzigove quit her acting dream after a very short time.

In regards to her personal life, now a mother of three, Herzigova admits that she never thought children were for her.

She says: ‘I never saw myself as a mum. There are girls who grow up thinking of marriage and babies, but I never wanted that. But now it is everything to me.

‘When I had the first [baby], I wondered why I waited so long, but it was timing – I never had the right man before.’
