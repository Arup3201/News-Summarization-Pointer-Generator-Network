She wears a vibrantly coloured dress and her curled hair is adorned with bows and loops of pearls.

But the opulence of this mysterious 17th century woman's costume is only revealed when the tiny portrait is viewed through a magnifying glass.

The portrait miniature, known as Unknown Woman In A Masque Costume, forms part of a new exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum examining royal treasures over the centuries.

The diminutive portrait, painted in 1609, is the handiwork of Isaac Oliver, and features a lady of the court dressed in theatrical costume ready to take part in a masque - festive courtly entertainment featuring singing, dancing and lavish stage design.

Popular in the 16th and early 17th century, the court masque is a historic example of the kind of royal pomp and pageantry that, according to the curator of the new exhibition, is attracting fresh interest at a time when the popularity of the British monarchy is at a high.

Tessa Murdoch, curator of Treasures of the Royal Courts: Tudors, Stuarts and the Russian Tsars, the spectacular royal wedding celebrations, coupled with last year's Diamond Jubilee, had whetted the public appetite for the grandeur and opulence associated with royalty.

Ms Murdoch is hoping that renewed interest will encourage visitors to the exhibition, which features more than 150 different objects and examines the long-standing links between the British monarchy and the Russian Tsars from 1509 to 1685.

Featuring portraits, furnishings, textiles, clothing, portraits, jewellery and armour, the display reveals the majesty of the royal courts of Henry VIII to Charles II in Britain, and Ivan the Terrible to the early Romanovs in Russia.

It includes examples of valuable gifts presented by ambassadors and a rarely shown portrait of Elizabeth I.

Treasures of the Royal Courts: A V&A curator has said she is confident the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will go to become 'great patrons' of the arts, just like their forbears

The curator said she hoped the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would follow the examples of their forbears and become 'great patrons' of modern arts.

Ms Murdoch said she was confident William and Kate would step up to the challenge.

'Watch that space. I think it will happen,' she said.

Ms
Murdoch described the exhibition as a 'fresh approach' to the era, and 
emphasised the importance of exhibitions like this in informing the 
public about their heritage.

Martin
Roth, V&A director, said: 'This exhibition tells us about Britain's
long-standing relationship with Russia as well as highlighting 
similarities of diplomacy and exchange between both countries - then and
today.

'Our partnership with the Kremlin Museums continues this association and we are delighted to bring together such extraordinary treasures from both museums.'

The exhibition marks the 400 year anniversary of the Romanov dynasty and runs from March 9 to July 14 at London's Victoria and Albert Museum.

Spanning the centuries: A row of 16th century suits of armour at the exhibition, called Treasures of the Royal Court: Tudors, Stuarts and the Russian Tsars, which will run until July 14 at the V&A
