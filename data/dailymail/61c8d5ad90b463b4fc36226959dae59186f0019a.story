The Duchess of Cambridge and Duchess of Cornwall are known to share beauty secrets - and it seems that they have been passing their tips onto Prince Harry.

The young Royal has Elizabeth Arden's Eight Hour Cream in his kit bag for his Walking With The Wounded Allied Challenge expedition to the South Pole.

The Prince, who embarked on the challenge this week, was advised to use the cream by Conrad Dickinson, an 
experienced polar guide who used it during his
 expedition to the North Pole in 2011.

Beauty secret: Prince Harry has been using Elizabeth Arden's Eight Hour Cream to keep his skin soft in the Antarctic

The £29 cream was created seventy years ago by Elizabeth Arden as a balm to soothe her horse's bruises and has now become a cult product with one sold every two minutes in the UK, and every thirty seconds globally.

It is a blend of petrolatum and vitamin E, which aims to sooth dry skin and lock in moisture in harsh conditions.

Prince Harry isn't the only famous fan - Victoria Beckham, Cara Delevingne and Cheryl Cole swear by it too.

The 29-year-old Royal will complete the expedition in just under four weeks to raise money for the re-education and retraining of wounded ex-servicemen and women.

The 2013 Allied Challenge will see 
three teams of wounded soldiers from the UK, USA and Commonwealth race 
across 330km in temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius, skiing 
up to 20 hours a day.

Speaking about the charity expedition, of which Harry is patron, co-founder Ed Parker said: 'It is the most inhospitable conditions on the planet.'

Prince Harry, who is one sixth of the UK team, has already been described as the 'dynamo within the team,' by teammate Capt Disney.

Elizabeth Arden will be giving £1 for every product sold during the expedition to the charity.

Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream is a product I have written about many times over the years and one of the most iconic beauty products in the world, used and loved since the 1930s for its miracle multi-tasking moisturising properties.

It can now add to its impressive history as it is be in the kit bags of all three Walking With The Wounded teams - Prince Harry among them - for their expedition race to the South Pole.

Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream also comes in lipstick form, Lip Protectant Stick, £20, elizabetharden.co.uk.

Keeping your skin and lips protected as the temperature drops is essential - nobody wants chapped, cracked lips or red, sore skin, but in extreme weather, serious protection is required.

Many of those walking in the teams have very delicate, damaged skin, especially if they have been burnt. The non-covered areas, particularly the face and their amputee areas take a real battering from all the elements, including wind, UVA and UVB rays and the extreme cold climate. 

It is critical that they take care to protect their skin as they are at high risk of getting frostbite, which would prevent them from completing the challenge.Conrad Dickinson, an experienced Polar Guide, recommended that the teams take Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Skin Protectant in their expedition kit to the South Pole because he has used it before and found it highly effective in giving the skin extra protection during the challenge to the North Pole in 2011.It was originally created in the 1930s by Miss Elizabeth Arden to soothe her famous thoroughbred horses’ legs. It became very beneficial to her clients, even its name came about thanks to a remarkable performance – a loyal client used it to treat her child’s skinned knee and “eight hours later” the skin was all better. Its effectiveness is attributed to a perfect balance of skin-shielding petrolatum, Vitamin E and soothing, anti-inflammatory beta-hydroxy acid.

Its multi-tasking uses protect skin from drying sun, wind and minor skin irritations; it is the essential beauty product for make-up artists, used to highlight eyes and cheeks, all year round Ideal for using after shaving or waxing; great to soften wind-chapped hands and rough, dry cuticle

It is a wonderful antidote for rough heels and soles and is the perfect in-flight moisture boost wherever and whenever skin feels dry.*In addition to supplying the team with their personal products Elizabeth Arden will donate £1 to Walking With the Wounded for every Eight Hour® Cream Skin Protectant, £25 (50ml) sold in the UK during their expedition (1st – 15th December)P.S...Prince Harry will not be the first member of the Royal family to be using Elizabeth Arden products. They have had the Royal warrant for fifty years and his grandmother likes their lipsticks. Most recently HM The Queen has been wearing either Elizabeth Arden Exceptional Lipstick in Fiesta or the new Beautiful colour.
