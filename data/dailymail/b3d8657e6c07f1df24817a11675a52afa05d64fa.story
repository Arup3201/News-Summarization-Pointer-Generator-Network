Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has hailed the impact of debutant summer signings Javi Manquillo and Dejan Lovren during their 2-1 victory over Southampton on Sunday.

Out of Liverpool’s seven summer signings, the two defenders were the only starters at Anfield and Rodgers was delighted with their performances; ‘I thought Lovren was excellent,’ Rodgers told reporters. 

Lovren signed for £20 million from Southampton this summer and Rodgers added: ‘It's always difficult when you play against your old team.

‘I thought he dealt with it really well. He's a real leader for us. I thought he was excellent.

Fellow debutant Javi Manquillo arrived on-loan from Atletico Madrid and Rodgers was full of praise: ‘I thought young Manquillo done well, considering he picked up a booking early on. At 19 years of age, I thought he was very, very good.’ 

The Liverpool manager also stated that left-back Alberto Moreno, recently acquired from Sevilla, is close to making a debut, whilst revealing that other new arrivals Lazar Markovic and Adam Lallana will be available for selection soon. 

‘Thankfully we have got young Moreno coming in as well. He's a big talent,’ said Rodgers.

‘Markovic [is] now available, which is great and Adam Lallana won't be too far away in the next few weeks so, all in all, the squad is shaping up very well.’
