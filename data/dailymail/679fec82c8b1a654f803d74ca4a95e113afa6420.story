Louis van Gaal’s war of words with Manchester United legend Gary Neville has escalated over his analysis of a ‘lucky’ 2-1 win at Southampton.

Neville claimed United — up to third in the Barclays Premier League after a fifth straight win — had ‘got away with murder’ after winning with two goals from Robin van Persie. 

The Sky pundit also said United’s game with Liverpool on Sunday could be ‘the Dog and Duck versus the Red Lion’ but a furious Van Gaal said: ‘He is an ex-legend, a legend, a former player of Manchester United. Murder? That’s an English expression — maybe.

‘He can say everything because he is an ex-legend, but as an ex-legend, or as a legend, you have to know what you are saying.

‘You can interpret that how you like. It’s not difficult. When I say that, he has to pay attention to his words.’ 

Despite Van Gaal’s criticism he admitted United ‘got lucky’ at St Mary's.

Neville said on Monday Night Football: 'I don't think (they can win the league), they don't have the quality.

'They've been decimated with injuries. To say can they go and win the title? I think they're too short defensively at this moment in time. I don't think they're at that level I really don't.

'They're going to have to step it up. They look shaky on the ball. They lack counter attack, they lack speed, they didn't have anything.

'They've got away with murder tonight. United will be happy with the result but they will have to play better than that.

'I think they will get better, they're showing a bit of resilience. That's a good quality to have but they need to play better.' 

Neville does not believe Manchester United can challenge for the Premier League title despite the fact they won their fifth consecutive league match against Southampton

Van Gaal added: ‘Only three players played well. The others were not good. Normally you have six, seven, eight players who are good. But there were too many not good.

‘It’s fantastic now to be third in the table, but I hoped we’d do that with a better performance because we were the lucky team.

‘When you are the better team, you deserve more, but it is the goals which count. We have played the first six or seven matches and not won, but we were always the better team.’

Van Gaal also admitted he was forced to substitute rookie central defender Paddy McNair in the first half because of a succession of mistakes.

Paddy McNair was replaced by Manchester United team-mate Ander Herrera in the 39th minute

The Dutch coach said: ‘He had no confidence, he had given three chances away. It's very disappointing for me and for Paddy, but I had to because as a manager I am responsible. It's tough but it's also in his best interests.

‘I have made a lot of changes and all the boys can survive. It is only one match, one moment in a lifetime.’ Van Gaal also admitted Van Persie, who now has sixth in the Premier League, was one of the only three players on the pitch who could make a difference.

He added: ‘I think that not only the goals are telling us something about Van Persie, but also his performance. 

‘He was one of the three players on the pitch of Manchester United who were good, or maybe very good. He had a great influence on the result. Very positive.’

Van Persie added: ‘We didn’t play well but this is our fifth straight win and we are on the way up. In the end we nicked it.

'I felt good and fitness wise it gets better each week. If I am fit the goals and assists will come. 

‘The first goal was a gamble. Nine out of 10 it doesn’t come off but you make your own luck. I was a bit lucky because the ball went under the keeper’s legs.

‘Next up is Liverpool and although we take it game by game we are happy we are on the up and we have to keep the momentum.’ 

United have more injury concerns ahead of Sunday’s clash with Liverpool at Old Trafford after Chris Smalling was forced off in the first half with a groin problem.
