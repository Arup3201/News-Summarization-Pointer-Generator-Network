The mobile map rivalry between Apple and Google could soon heat up right on Apple’s digital turf.

Google is putting the ‘finishing touches’ on a test version of its new mapping application that will work on Apple’s iOS 6-powered iPhones, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Google is just a few steps away from submitting the product to Apple’s digital marketplace, say people in the know.

Apple Map: Apple released an update to its new iPhone and iPad operating system in September that replaced Google Maps with Apple's own map application

If the new mapping app is accepted into 
the iTunes store, it will directly compete against Apple's own  mapping software, which has been repeatedly called a ‘flop.’

When Apple launched its new mobile operating system in September, the Silicon Valley heavyweight replaced a working version of Google Maps with its own new Maps application, which quickly came under fire for its numerous flaws.

Consumers were outraged, the media went to town and Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook issued a public apology.

‘At Apple, we strive to make world-class products that deliver the best experience possible to our customers,’ Cook wrote in a letter to customers posted on the company’s website. ‘With the launch of our new Maps last week, we fell short on this commitment.’

Sources were unable to tell the Wall 
Street Journal when Google will actually submit its new maps 
applications to the iTunes store and whether or not Apple is likely to accept it.

Still, the news remains a positive 
sign for iPhone 5 owners who have been begging Apple for a stand-alone 
Google Maps application since the release of iOS 6.
