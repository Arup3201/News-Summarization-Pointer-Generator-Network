'A 'fruitcake test' has been used by the UK Independence Party to uncover unsuitable characters who might embarrass the party.

Psychometric tests were used to analyse the personalities, reliability and honesty of more than 300 people wanting to run in next year’s European elections.

Experts were called in to prevent a repeat of May’s local elections when UKIP candidates were accused of sexism, racism and homophobia.

But one candidate who passed with flying colours was Godfrey Bloom, the sitting MEP who last week railed against Britain giving aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’.

Pass: UKIP's Godfrey Bloom cleared the party's psychometric testing, but last week caused a political storm after complaining about British aid being sent to Bongo Bongo land

UKIP leader Nigel Farage ordered a shake-up of the party selection process to weed out people with views which risked living up to David Cameron’s infamous claim that the party was a ‘bunch of fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’.

A professional recruitment company was hired to oversee the process, ahead of elections to the European Parliament in May 2014.

Many predict UKIP could top the poll – forcing the Tories into second place- but such success will bring unprecedented levels of scrutiny.

Psychometric testAnswer 160 questions about your personality and rank response 1-7

Media testFace a grilling from a journalist, giving soundbites without flustering

Writing testProduce a press release which a local newspaper would willingly use

Public speaking testAddress a room of people, who score your ability to wow a crowd

Information testScour a bundle of information and give a pithy response, in line with party policy

At a gruelling bootcamp candidates faced
160 questions about their personalities, where they were asked to rank 
their responses from 1 to 7.

The answers were then analysed to see if they were consistent to weed out anyone displaying dishonest traits or ‘game’ the system.

Would-be politicians went on to face a series of tasks to see if they could cope with the pressure of being a UKIP representative.

It included a series of grillings by a panel of party bigwigs, and mock media interviews to see how they would fare being torn apart by a Jeremy Paxman or John Humphrys.

A writing test challenged them to produce a press release which might get used by local newspapers.

In another section, each candidate was given a large bundle of information from which they had to produce a pithy response, which was in line with party policy.

As the 300 were whittled down to just 77, successful candidates included Daily Express journalist Patrick O’Flynn, Mr Bloom and Mr Farage.

But Mike Nattrass, currently UKIP MEP for the West Midlands, did not make the grade.

Journalist James Delingpole, who boasted on his application form that his skills include 'winding up greenies or lefties', was also rejected.

In a letter to members he said: '‘I’ve just this second had a call from [UKIP chairman] Steve Crowther telling me I didn’t make the cut anyway.

'Apparently – quelle surprise! – I did well on the public speaking bit; but fell down on the psychometric testing (!) and the interviews.

'Seems what you’re looking for is solid candidates with years of party membership and proven dedication to the nitty gritty of party business. Well if those are your criteria, you’ve certainly done the right thing!’

Former Tory MP Neil Hamilton was not included on the list, but Mr Farage is reportedly planning a 'different leading role for the party'.

Thumbs down: The new process ordered by UKIP leader Nigel Farage saw just 77 out of 300 wannabe politicians make it through to the next stage

To even get to the stage of being 
considered for selection to stand in the MEP elections, they first had 
to have passed a test set for anyone wanting to be a UKIP MP.

This included five tests covering knowledge of party policy, media scrutiny and public speaking.

Only those who achieved an A grade even made it on to the long list to try to stand for Brussels.

The
final list of approved candidates will now be sent to every UKIP 
member, who will vote on who should top the lists in each region for the
European elections.

During the local elections, UKIP candidates were suspended or investigated after being pictured making a Nazi salute, denying the Holocaust or having links to the BNP.

The party leadership hopes the tough new tests will prevent future similar embarrassment, but cannot guarantee it.

‘No system designed by man will ever be foolproof,’ said a source.

Meanwhile a UKIP local council candidate is to be charged over claims that he used fake signatures on his election nomination form.

Hugh Mennie, who stood for election to Cambridgeshire County Council in May, is accused of causing or permitting a false statement to appear in a nomination paper.
