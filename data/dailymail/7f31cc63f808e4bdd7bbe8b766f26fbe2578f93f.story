Listen up: Motorists try to find out the reason for the delay after the Dartford Crossing was closed following a security threat

Hold up: Motorists are facing long delays after a security alert on the Dartford Crossing

One witness told tonight how he thought the arrested man was waving around a 'gun' during the security alert on the M25.

Van driver Paul Auty, 39, said: 'This man was wandering around between the lines of traffic waiting to go through the toll booths, and he was waving his arms around and shouting.

'It looked to like he had something in his hand, I thought it was a gun, but I couldn't be sure because he was about 50 metres away from me.

'But he was definitely pointing it like he was holding a gun. A few other people stuck in the traffic with me thought the same as me because we got chatting during the long delay.

Tonight Kent Police would only say the man had been arrested for 'acting strangely'. They did not say whether he was found in possession of any weapon.

Photographs posted on social networking site Twitter showed long queues of stationary traffic with some commuters standing outside their vehicles.

Some motorists reported seeing a ‘foreign’ man shouting and behaving suspiciously around the toll booths at the Dartford Crossing on the M25.

It is thought he may have been on a coach and had got off at the toll.

A picture posted by a driver on Twitter showed the traffic had been stopped on the Dartford side of the crossing, around 200 metres back from the toll booths.

No traffic was being allowed through the tunnels which run from Dartford to Thurrock.Meanwhile, traffic on the other carriageway were behing held on the bridge which runs from Thurrock to Dartford and again the area around the toll booths was sealed off.

One person posted on Twitter: 'Crazed foreign man seen running between cars at dartford crossing shouting.'

While @BoyceDrew tweeted: 'Security incident at Dartford tnl. I came through there early and some foreign guy was running through the cars shouting at everyone.
