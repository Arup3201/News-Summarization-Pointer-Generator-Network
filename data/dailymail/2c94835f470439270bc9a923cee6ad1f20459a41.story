SPAIN has raised the stakes in the row with Britain over Gibraltar by vowing to take ‘every legal step necessary’ to protect its interests.

Prime minister Mariano Rajoy refused to back down in the dispute over the Rock as ten Royal Navy warships prepare to set sail for the Mediterranean.

Making it clear he was ready to damage relations between the two countries to protect national pride, he pledged to take ‘proportionate measures’ in response to London’s announcement that a rapid reaction force will depart on Monday.

The UK force will include the 
helicopter carrier Illustrious. Three ships, including the frigates 
Westminster and Montrose, will dock in Gibraltar.

Naval chiefs stressed the visit is part of a long-planned exercise, and not in response to the diplomatic row.

Tension between Britain and Spain 
over the sovereignty of the Rock intensified following a row over 
fishing rights and the imposition of punitive border checks.

Speaking after a meeting with Spain’s
King Juan Carlos, Mr Rajoy said: ‘I hope things don’t get worse but 
Spain obviously has to defend its national interests and that is what we
are going to do.

‘The measures will be proportionate 
and random and will not discriminate against anyone. But Spain will of 
course take every legal step necessary to defend the interests of 
Spanish citizens.

‘We must continue the checks we have been carrying out over the past few days.’

He urged ‘common sense’ and dialogue 
as he slapped down David Cameron over his plea in a phone call this week
to end the ‘unacceptable’ border checks.

Mr Cameron said Britain ‘will always 
stand up for the people of Gibraltar’. The Foreign Office said it was 
aware of Mr Rajoy’s comments. Downing Street said the UK position ‘has 
been quite clear’.
