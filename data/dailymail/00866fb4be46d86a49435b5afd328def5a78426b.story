A nursery nurse and her boyfriend murdered their 11-month-old son then claimed his injuries were caused by the family dog, a court heard today.

Oliver Sargent collapsed at his home in Telford, Shropshire, and was found not breathing by his parents Paul Thomas, 29, and Ashlea Thomas, 21, before being taken to hospital by ambulance.

A scan revealed the toddler had suffered a three-inch fracture to the left rear side of his skull, as well as bleeding to the right side of his brain and bleeding to his left eye.

Death: Oliver Sargent (pictured) collapsed at his home in Telford and was found not breathing by his parents

Doctors also discovered he had historic injuries including healing fractures to two of his left ribs and a fracture to his left collarbone, Birmingham Crown Court was told.

He was at first admitted to Princess Royal Hospital in Telford but died from head injuries four days later at Birmingham Children’s Hospital in July 2012.

While being quizzed by police Mr Thomas claimed the injuries may have been inflicted by their dog Rocco knocking over Oliver or sitting on him, the court heard.

Mrs Thomas - who married Mr Thomas after their son’s death - also told doctors that previous injuries he had suffered may have actually been caused by him rolling over his toys.

His parents were initially arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm while Oliver was still alive - but the couple were then charged with murder after his death.

Andrew Smith QC, prosecuting, told the court: ‘Paul Thomas said he had not really got a clue about how Oliver had got any of his injuries other than to suggest an incident involving the family dog.’

He said experts’ opinions had led to a conclusion that Oliver had suffered ‘deliberately inflicted injuries immediately before his collapse and the calling of the emergency services’.

Mr Smith added: ‘The prosecution contends that there was a recent skull, brain and eye injury with no credible explanation other than deliberately inflicted injury.’

Treatment: Oliver was at first admitted to Princess Royal Hospital (pictured) in Telford but died from head injuries four days later at Birmingham Children’s Hospital in July 2012.

The court heard Mr Thomas, a ground worker on building sites, even asked a police officer how long he would be sent to jail over what had happened to Oliver.

During the same journey, Mrs Thomas asked an officer if they thought she had ‘battered’ her baby son. 

She was allegedly later overheard by a nurse asking her mother ‘how long do you think I am going to get’, but then told police it was a reaction to ‘everyone pointing the finger’ of blame.

The couple, from Telford, deny murder, causing or allowing the death of a child and child cruelty. The trial, estimated to last five weeks, continues.
