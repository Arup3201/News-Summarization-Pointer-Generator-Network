A senior Church of  England cleric was dubbed ‘divisive, unfair and wrong’ yesterday after suggesting older people should get less help from the state.

Bishop of London Richard Chartres condemned the way today’s ‘fortunate generation’ of retirees are soaking up tax- payers’ money.

He used a speech to say Government spending on so-called baby boomers – those born in the 20 years after the Second World War – ‘raises questions of intergenerational equity’.

But the Bishop, who at 65 is himself a member of the group he criticises, has drawn rapid criticism from pension experts and pressure groups.

Retirement fund specialist and author Dr Ros Altmann said: ‘What is forgotten is that this generation isn’t lucky.

‘They worked hard. They built up the economy. In reality the Government has taken advantage of them.

‘They come to the later stages of their lives after working and saving all their lives.

‘Younger people look on in envy at wealthy older people, and they think they are representative of an entire generation. But most people in their 60s and 70s are on or below average income.’

She added: ‘The idea of an intergenerational war is very dangerous to our social fabric. What young people should be doing is aspiring to be like their elders.’

Bishop Chartres, who is third in the hierarchy of the Church of England and who led the service for Margaret Thatcher’s funeral in April, said baby boomers were lucky to have seen huge improvements in their standard of living during their lives.

However, state spending had more than doubled in 15 years and ‘much is absorbed by the fortunate generation to which I belong’ he added.

His speech appeared to agree with some politicians and think tanks that spending on the elderly is unfair on the young and that older people could be  taxed out of larger homes.

However, Neil Duncan- Jordan of the National Pensioners’ Convention said: ‘This is all a bit more complicated than the baby boomer bishop would like us to believe.

‘We should not be trying to divide one generation from another.

‘The Bishop of London thinks older people are a burden on the state. But they are the people who paid for the pensions of the generation before them, and now the working generation is paying their pensions. That is the way it has worked since 1948.’

Chris Jessop of health insurer AXA PPP said the total net contribution of older people in 2010 was estimated at about £40billion and is expected to grow to £75billion by 2030.

‘We believe that this contribution will continue to grow with the older generation playing an even bigger part in the workforce and as such giving more back to society,’ he said.

Michelle Mitchell of Age UK said: ‘It is important to see beyond the misconception that all older people have benefited from the boom years.

‘While a small minority are very wealthy, many more are struggling, despite having worked for decades, paid taxes and contributed to society.

‘Of those over 65, 1.7million are living in poverty with more just above the poverty line and struggling to get by.’
