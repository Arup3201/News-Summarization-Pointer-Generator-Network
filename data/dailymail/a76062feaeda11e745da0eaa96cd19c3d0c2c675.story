Parallel universe: Richard Butler-Creagh told 'lie after lie' in trying to establish his claim to the £5million

A man who tried to squeeze a £5million fee from the sale of the house that inspired Toad Hall was told he 'lives in a parallel universe' by a High Court judge in London yesterday.

Richard Butler-Creagh hoped to make millions by acting as an intermediary in the sale of Fawley Court near Henley-on-Thames in Buckinghamshire.

And yesterday he went to court to sue the company set up to buy the 17th Century pile for the disputed £5million fee.

But Mr Justice Eady threw out the legal action against Aida Hersham and 
Cherrilow Limited after he found that Mr Butler-Creagh had constructed an elaborate scheme to convince the defendants
 to pay him millions for doing 'effectively nothing'.

He said the case was rife with allegations of dishonesty with each side accusing the other of forging documents and Ms Hersham and Cherrilow characterising Mr Butler-Creagh as a 'confidence trickster' and 'middle man' fraudster.

Mr Butler-Creagh had acquired the contract for the grand 
house - thought to have been designed by Christopher Wren - from the 
Marian Fathers, a Roman Catholic order, for £22.5million in 2008.

He
 claimed Ms Hersham, an Iranian heiress living in Belgravia, London, 
owed him a £5million 'facilitating fee' after he agreed to let her 'step
 into his shoes' and buy the impressive property.

The grand Fawley Court was reputedly Kenneth 
Grahame's inspiration for Toad Hall in his 1908 classic The Wind In The 
Willows.

Ms Hersham denied that there had been any such agreement. Cherrilow eventually bought the stunning country property for £13million.

Mr Justice Eady threw out the action after finding Mr Butler-Creagh had failed to establish his case, adding that it was clear the developer had a scheme in mind.

The judge said it was clear Mr Butler-Creagh did not have the means to buy the property on his own and had instead planned to bring someone else in to provide the funding.

He added: 'He was then to take a turn or commission by placing himself
 between that person and the Marian Fathers.

'He saw the opportunity to make £5million for doing effectively nothing.'

'In order to achieve that, he would 
have to deceive both the Marian Fathers, by giving them the false 
impression that he had the means and the intention to acquire the 
property himself, and the hapless punter, by pretending to him or her 
that he was a necessary intermediary.

'In truth, and in law, he had no other role than as an officious bystander.'

Mr Butler-Creagh, added the judge in London, 'told lie after lie' in his dealings with the Marian Fathers and Ms Hersham.

'He even lied in his witness 
statements before the court, claiming for example that the Bank of 
Ireland had previously provided finance for him in respect of other 
property developments. This he sought to explain away in court as a 
mistake.'

Despite his 
audacious lies, Mr Justice Eady said Mr Butler-Creagh had given the 
impression of being confident and self-assured while giving evidence to 
court.

'Yet it emerged very 
clearly from his two days and more of cross-examination that he lives in
 a parallel universe where truth and falsehood imperceptibly merge, the 
one into the other, he being quite insensitive to the distinction 
between them,' the judge said.

In his own mind Mr Butler-Creagh justified such behaviour as being necessary to survive in what the developer described as 'a commercial world out there'.

He had accepted in court that he was 'not too scrupulous' in what he was prepared to say to obtain business opportunities.

The judge concluded that Cherrilow did rely, as always intended by Mr Butler-Creagh, on false misrepresentations of fact and had it not done so, the purchase would not have been made.

The company claims it has lost £9,864,940 from the transaction, but any compensation payments have yet to be finalised.
