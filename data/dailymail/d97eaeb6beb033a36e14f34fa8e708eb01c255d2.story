Abdullah Abdullatif Alkadi, 23, a student from Saudi Arabia. Alkadi sold his car, abandoned his university classes and disappeared in the deserts of Riverside County

A man charged with killing a Saudi Arabian college student in California stabbed him in an attempt to keep both the car he had arranged to buy via Craigslist and the $30,000 the student wanted for the car, police revealed today.

Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said at a news conference Monday that 28-year-old Agustin Rosendo Fernandez of Long Beach was found with the Audi that sparked the murder of 23-year-old Abdullah Abdullatif Alkadi. 

He also made a statement that led authorities to the missing student's body off a desert freeway.

Fernandez has been charged with murder and made his initial court appearance Monday afternoon. 

He did not enter a plea and will return for arraignment next month.

Fernandez is facing one count of murder with the special circumstances of murder during a robbery and murder during a carjacking.

The complaint states that a knife was used in the crime.

'The investigation determined that Agustin Fernandez killed Mr. Alkadi in an attempt to keep both the Audi and the purchase price,' Beck said. 

'Craigslist, eBay, all the other opportunities for sales are also opportunities to let unwanted people into your lives,' Beck said. 'This happened, not the victim's fault, but with (an) absolutely tragic, tragic outcome.'

Peace: Alkadi's brother Ahmed said that Abdullah was a peaceful guy and asked for empathy in spite of any religious or language barriers

Fernandez is eligible for the death penalty due to the special circumstance allegations.

Alkadi vanished on September 17 from his home near California State University, Northridge, where he was a student.

Abdullah Abdullatif Alkadi, 23, was found dead on Thursday along Interstate 10 in Palm Deserts, more than two hours away from his Los Angeles home where he was last seen.

He had sold his Audi S-5 through Craigslist with an asking price of more than $35,000 the day before he was last seen.

LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said that 28-year-old Agustin Rosendo Fernandez was found with the Audi that led to the killing of 23-year-old Abdullah Abdullatif Alkadi, and made a statement that led authorities to the body off a desert freeway.

Alkadi had moved to the United States in 2010 to pursue a degree in electrical engineering student at Cal State University, Northridge according to his brother, Ahmed, 32, who is also a student there.

'He wanted to make his family, his parents and himself proud,' said Ahmed. 'He wanted to be a contributing member in our society but things turned out the other way around.'

Beck said the second person who had been arrested is no longer in custody, but remains under investigation.

The month-long search for Alkadi brought in the FBI at the request of the LAPD, according to spokesperson Laura Eimiller. 

She declined
to further discuss details of the FBI's involvement because Los
Angeles police detectives were leading the investigation.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Alkadi's cell phone had been tracked to Beaumont, 80 miles east of Los
Angeles, but that someone had deactivated it.

Police located the car Alkadi sold and said the buyer was not connected to the man's disappearance.

Robbery?: Alkadi disappeared the day after he sold an Audi on Craigslist with a listed price of over $35,000, though the buyer was cleared of any connection

Ahmed will accompany his brother's remains back to Khobar in Saudi Arabia, where Alkadi's parents live.

'He was a peaceful guy,' said Ahmed. 'Regardless of any barriers we have with language or religion, he's a human being. I would like the public to pray for his soul to have peace in eternity.'
