Ms Hawkins, who married Mr Herbert, a senior executive at drinks firm Pernod Ricard, at Chichester Cathedral in 2008, confirmed her happy news with viewers on the show last August.

She took to Twitter herself at the time, adding: 'I'm delighted to announce some breaking news of my own on this morning - I'm pregnant! 

'Big thanks for all the lovely messages.'

In November she revealed she was considering undergoing IVF treatment, but then discovered she was expecting.

She added: 'It took a long while for it to sink in I was pregnant because we’d been trying for quite some time.'
