A man knocked down his £500,000 former home in less than an hour because he faced eviction, a court has heard.

Christopher McGowan, 50, allegedly used a hired JCB to demolish the rear ground floor wall of Silver Bow Farm in Greenbottom, near Truro, Cornwall.

His actions left the property structurally unsound after prosecutors claim he smashed through doors, kitchen and bathroom units.

A jury heard that when McGowan went on the wrecking spree he also removed all the fixtures and fittings from the house.

From the front the house looks okay, but it is a wreck after McGowan allegedly became angry when a million-pound property deal fell through

It is alleged that he wanted ‘to punish’ the new owners of the house after a million-pound property deal went sour.

Truro Crown Court was told that he had already been evicted from the house and land after it was sold to Janet Taylour for nearly half a million pounds.

Philip Lee, prosecuting, said McGowan had been declared bankrupt in 2009 and was in negative equity with debts of more than £500,000.

He was setting up a £1million deal with Wycliffe Estates, managed by Mrs Taylour’s son, Christopher Taylour but it fell through when he failed to disclose his bankruptcy.

It then emerged that he did not even hold the legal title to the property and was due to be evicted in September 2010.

Mrs Taylour bought the property for £470,000 in February 2011 from McGowan’s mortgage lenders.

He was allowed to remain living there but could not pay his rent and an appeal against the eviction order failed in July 2012.

Mr Lee said the following month he hired the JCB from a nearby construction firm and returned it within an hour.

He told the court: 'On August 16 he hired a digger and returned it within 40 minutes. The nature and extent of the damage is such that it can only have been done deliberately.

'The defendant has the motive and the
inclination to punish the Taylours. He must have been responsible for 
the damage. There is no other reasonable explanation.'

Mr Lee added: 'It’s the Crown’s case 
that by then the defendant was in an angry and desperate state of mind 
as a result of being unable to meet his mortgage.

'The defendant had hopes of making a 
significant financial gain but in the end he was not in a position to 
sell the property. He was not in a position to negotiate any deals.'

The court heard that Mr Taylour went to the house later the same day and found extensive damage.

Mr Lee said: 'The rear ground floor wall had been destroyed rendering the property structurally unsound.'

The
jury were handed photographs of the scene showing that doors, kitchen 
and bathroom units and fixtures and fittings had all been removed.

McGowan,
of Chacewater, Cornwall, denies two counts of causing criminal damage. 
The jury had heard he has admitted fraud and forgery connected to the 
case.

The case continues.
