Legal experts have said SNP plans to charge British students university fees after independence could be in breach of the law

Charging British students up to £9000 in tuition fees if they attend Scottish universities after independence would be illegal, experts in EU law have ruled. 

The SNP-led Scottish Government has said that English, Welsh and Northern Irish students would continue to pay fees following a yes vote in September’s referendum, even though Scottish students and those from other EU countries outside of the UK would continue to be entitled to free tuition.

But two legal experts say that the controversial charging regime flouts EU laws because it would be discriminatory.  

Niamh Nic Shuibhne (CORR), professor of European Union Law at Edinburgh University, said the Scottish Government would face ‘an extremely steep uphill battle’ to convince the EU its plans were legal.

And Paul Beaumont, professor of European Law at Aberdeen University, branded the move as ‘overt discrimination’ against students from the rest of the UK – and said it is ‘hard to see’ how it can be justified.

Their verdicts are contained within a new report due to be published tomorrow (MON) by a collection of academics who have set up an offshoot of the pro-Union Better Together campaign. 

It is a blow to the SNP, as it is estimated that giving free education to students from the rest of the UK would cost an extra £150 million – blowing a substantial hole in the nationalists’ education budgets. 

Professor Susan Shaw, former vice-principal of Strathclyde University and a member of the ‘Academics Together’ group, said:  ‘All the evidence points to the fact that Alex Salmond’s assertions on tuition fees don’t stand up to scrutiny.

‘The Scottish Government should publish any legal advice on charging students in the rest of the UK tuition fees if we go it alone, if any such advice even exists.

‘There is a real risk that the loss of funding from students in the rest of the UK would have negative consequences on our ability to teach Scotland’s students.

'The great irony of this issue is that the only way for the Scottish Government to guarantee its policy on tuition fees stays in place is for Scotland to remain in the UK.

‘Independence is a gamble we don’t need to take. As part of the UK we have the best of both worlds: we have a strong Scottish Parliament taking important decisions about our universities and colleges - and we can benefit from being part of the larger UK research system and the disproportionate share of UK research funding we receive.

Under the current funding system, EU and Scottish students are entitled to ‘free’ higher education in Scotland while English, Welsh and Northern Irish youngsters pay up to £9,000 a year.

Experts say Scotland would have to treat the rest of the UK like all other European countries following independence

The SNP Government’s white paper on independence states that ‘the Scottish Government proposes to maintain the status quo by continuing our current policy of charging fees to students from the rest of the UK to study at Scottish higher education institutions’. 

The new Academics Together report states that the proposals would ‘run into significant problems with European law’. 

It goes on: ‘If Scotland leaves the UK and joins the EU as a separate state, the rest of the UK will become like any other European Union country.

‘As a result, Scotland will be legally obliged to provide university education free to students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland.’

However, higher education body Universities Scotland has said that its own legal advice suggests it ‘would be possible’ to continue the policy.

A spokesman for SNP Education Secretary Mike Russell said: ‘The White Paper is consistent with, and informed by, legal advice the Government has received. 

‘The content of any legal advice is confidential.  By long standing convention, successive Scottish and Westminster governments have not disclosed the source or content of legal advice other than in the most exceptional circumstances.

‘There is however, very clear legal opinion already published by the universities themselves on this issue. It makes clear the possibility of continuing the current system within EU law.

‘It is entirely legitimate, of course, for people to express other views and that is a debate we welcome. What is a nonsense is for the no Camp to ignore the substantial and credible advice provided to Universities Scotland – a body of impeccable neutrality on the question of independence.’
