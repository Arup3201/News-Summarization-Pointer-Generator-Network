Most people use a bridge to cross from one side to another. Not these talented gymnasts.

This incredible video shows them pushing their bodies to the limit while dangling from a huge structure in the French countryside.

The athletes do amazing ring tricks under a bridge and over the water in the footage as they demonstrate phenomenal agility, strength, conditioning and elasticity.

The gymnasts complete a series of moves and demonstrations in impressive Olympic style during the video which runs for just over two minutes and nine seconds.

The participants attach ropes and rings to the bridge and prepare to showcase their magnificent skills as the video commences and the Dropkick Murphys song I'm Shipping Up To Boston plays in the background.

One of the gymnasts can be seen powdering his hands while his colleagues subsequently experiment with rings and ropes as they hurl themselves off the bridge.

Another gymnast rolls his finger on his head as if to imply that he is crazy. Moments later another gymnast is seen somersaulting backwards off the bridge.

The gymnasts perform an exciting and impressive display which includes an abundance of swinging, circling, transitional, and release moves. 

Rings: A gymnast swings from the rings during the entertaining two minute video

Spin: A gymnast points his legs skywards as he dangles from the bridge in the French countryside

Duo: Two  gymnasts spins their body using the rings during the impressive demonstration
