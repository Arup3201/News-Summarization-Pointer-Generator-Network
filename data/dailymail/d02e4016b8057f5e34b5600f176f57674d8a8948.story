A Mexico City pro-breastfeeding ad campaign is being re-worked after it fueled a storm of protest from women's health groups over its highly sexualized nature.

'Give your breast to your child, don't turn your back on them', read the ad banners, splashed across the chests of thin local celebrities in topless poses which expose their distinctly non-mummy-tummies.

An anonymous official at Mexico City's health department has acknowledged that the campaign's slogan will be changed 
and that its next phase may include more average, 
everyday mothers.

Ideal poster girl? Mexico City's health department has caused protest over a recent sexed up ad campaign (pictured) to promote breastfeeding which states 'Give your breast to your child, don't turn your back on them'

Regina Tames, director of the Group for Informed Reproductive Choice, says of the ads: 'It's not only a very terrible campaign in terms of how it looks, but it's also the message that if you don't breastfeed, you are a bad mother and you are the one to blame', according to KBPS.

Some activists have pointed out that the ads look more like shampoo or soap
 commercials - which routinely feature lighter-skinned, glamorous models - 
than a discussion of a serious problem.

Even one of the campaign's stars, actress Camila Sodi, asked on Twitter 'not be associated with the campaign of breastfeeding.'

Guilt-tripping? These somewhat smug photos do little to address the reasons behind the fact that only one in seven mothers in Mexico breastfeed exclusively in the first six months, as per World Health recommendations

'I did not authorize anything, and I think it's in bad taste,' she wrote, later releasing a statement to say that although she supports the cause and posed for the campaign, she wasn't consulted on the final artwork.

Mothers and women's groups were quick to accuse the government of making women feel guilty, instead of addressing the real-life barriers to breast feeding.

One group of activists wrote a complaint letter to Mexico City's human rights commission, starting: '[The ads] condemn mothers, rather than 
informing them about breast feeding, and they reduce a social problem 
with multiple players - fathers as well as mothers, workplaces, health 
authorities, and public spaces and the community at large — to one 
person: the mother.'

Hardly a mommy tummy! Many women have complained about the campaign's use of thin, light-skinned local celebrities instead of more 'average, everyday mothers' - which officials say they will alter

'It doesn't look like they did any 
diagnosis as to why women don't breast feed', agrees Ms Thames. 'They just 
lighted on a banal argument that women were selfish and don't want to 
mess up their bodies.'

City officials released the campaign to address 
the fact that only one in seven mothers in Mexico breast feeds 
exclusively in the first six months, which is the standard recommended by the 
World Health Organization.

That is among the lowest levels in Latin 
America, and health experts say it's a serious problem for a country 
where millions live in extreme poverty and dirty water threatens health. Mother's milk is thus of vital importance because it’s richer in nutrients and antibodies that protect newborns from infections.

Take it down! Even one of the campaign's own stars, actress Camili Sodi (pictured left and right), took issue with the way in which her image had been used to promote breast-feeding in Mexico

The city's health department had intended to use the ads to publicize its broader effort of setting up dozens of breast-feeding areas: comfortable, screened-off rooms with sinks and refrigerators to hold breast milk.

'It's not only a very terrible campaign 
in terms of how it looks, but it's also the message that if you don't 
breastfeed, you are a bad mother and you are the one to blame'

But only three such centers currently operate in this metropolis of nine million people. Women also face prohibitions on breast feeding or pumping at work, get about 12 weeks maternity leave on average, and often draw hostile stares if they breast feed in public.

Furthermore, Mexico has yet to sign on to the World Health Organization guidelines that restrict hospitals from handing out free baby formula and marketing their products to new mothers.

It is unknown how soon it will be until the new, altered campaign will be revealed.
