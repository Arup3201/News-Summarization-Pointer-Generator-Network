One woman was airlifted to hospital and 28 others taken by ambulance after a crash on the M4 near Cardiff

The first accident happened after the coach collided with a 4x4 and other cars on the eastbound carriageway

Emergency services arrived at the scene at around midday and the road remained shut for around four hours

The accident happened after the coach collided with a 4x4, which subsequently hit other cars on the eastbound carriageway.

A South Wales police spokesman said the coach is understood to have contained passengers from the Bridgend area travelling to Cardiff to see a show. 

A spokesman for Cresta Coaches confirmed the coach was carrying pensioners, but declined to comment further. 

Minutes later, on the westbound side, another vehicle, which was towing another car, overturned.

First on the scene was fireman Lee Morley, who happened to be driving westbound when he saw the crash happen. 

The 27-year-old, from Swansea, immediately pulled into the hard shoulder and found a woman in a car who was breathing, but unconscious.

The accident caused miles of tailbacks after the section between junctions 33 and 34 near Cardiff was closed

One person caught up in the disruption said a 45-minute journey ended up taking twice as long due to delays

'I got her to come round by talking to her and doing what I'm trained to do,' he told the BBC. 

'The minibus went into the back of a car, the car then went into the back of a Range Rover and that then went into another car, which spun out and scrunched.'

He added that he spotted children standing on the side of the road who had been in the cars caught up in the accident.

'The minibus was full of pensioners and I think they were on their way to see the musical Top Hat in Cardiff,' he said.  

Those caught in the disruption said traffic was gridlocked for several miles on both sides of the accident. 

Cory Richards told MailOnline: 'There were countless ambulances at the crash scene with an air ambulance present, one or two fire engines. 

'A bus had crashed into a Land Rover which had then itself crashed into the car in front.

'There were several people sitting on the outer reservations while the services did their work. 

'Traffic was three to four miles of gridlock either side of the accident and a journey that would take 45 minutes to an hour took us an hour and a half.' 

A South Wales Fire and Rescue spokesman said: 'We took the call at 11.55am. It was road traffic collision involving a minibus, a 4x4 and three cars.

'One person was extricated using hydraulic cutting equipment and conveyed to hospital by air ambulance.

'A total of 28 casualties were transported to hospital from the incident suffering various injuries.' 

Witneses reported people sitting on the outer reservations as the emergency services did their work

Police, ambulances and South West Fire and Rescue service attended the scene and extricated one person with cutting equipment

Lee Morley, a fireman who was the first on the scene, said the coach was full of pensioners going to Cardiff

Anyone who witnessed the collision involving the bus is asked to contact South Wales Police on 101.
