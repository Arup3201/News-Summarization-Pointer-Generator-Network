Swingers on the hunt for excitement are spreading sexually transmitted infections by taking part in drug-fuelled orgies, new research claims.

A Dutch study found almost half of older swingers admitted taking illegal substances to boost their prowess in the bedroom and keep multiple partners satisfied.

As well as erectile dysfunction drugs such as Viagra, they are also using cocaine, ecstasy (MDMA), GHB, laughing gas, cannabis, poppers, speed, LSD and lysergic acid to help them perform - at levels similar to gay men.

Researchers found 13 per cent of swingers - with an average age of 45 - had chlamydia or gonorrhoea

However, their unsafe sexual practices are putting them at increasing risk of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B, experts warn.

The researchers, writing in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, say swingers should be targeted with the same health advice as other at-risk groups.

These people are known to engage in high risk sexual behaviour such as having multiple sexual partners, group sex, and unprotected sex, but there is little data on their use of drugs and what impact that has. 

Over-45s have previously been found to wrongly believe they had a low risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection (STI).

But there is little data on swingers who have recently been classified as an emerging high risk group for STIs.

The researchers therefore set out to assess the prevalence of drug use among swingers and its link with high-risk sexual behaviour and STIs.

In the first study of its kind, they studied 289 men and women with an average age 49. 

These people said they were swingers and had visited a STI clinic from 2009 to 2012 in South Limburg, The Netherlands.

For the study, they filled out a questionnaire on their sexual and drug use behaviour while swinging, over the preceding six months.

The researchers then looked for a link between sexual behaviour, drug use and STI diagnoses including chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B. 

More than three quarters of swingers reported recreational drug use - including alcohol, Viagra (pictured) and illegal drugs

They found 13 per cent of patients - with an average age of 45 - had chlamydia or gonorrhoea - similar to the rates among gay men and young people. 

Dr Laura Spauwen, of South Limburg Public Health Service in Geleen, The Netherlands, said: 'High-risk sexual behaviours are common among swingers.

'By definition, swingers are also involved in concurrent sex as they have overlapping partnerships over a fixed period of time.' 

More than three quarters of swingers reported recreational drug use - including alcohol and use of Viagra. 

Drugs were also frequently used in combination - especially the combination of GHB and MDMA.

In men, a combination of MDMA and erectile dysfunction drugs was frequently seen in men.

'Since swingers are involved in lengthy sexual acts with multiple partners,  male swingers use erectile dysfunction drugs to maintain while using other drugs,' explained Dr Spauwen.

She noted eight per cent of the women reported recreational use of Viagra, for which the effects are unknown. 

The results also showed that a quarter of the male participants had been with male swing partners in the last six months.

And more than half of those surveyed - both men and women - had group sex in the same period, with half of them not using condoms. 

Half reported having six or more sex partners over the preceding six months - and had not used a condom during vaginal sex.

There was no differences in sexually risky behaviour between men and women

Dr Spauwen added: 'Swingers - at least those attending our clinic - are a generally older group. 

'The prevalence of drug use observed among swingers in this study is very high and comparable with what is observed in men who have sex with men.' 

Half of swingers interviewed reported having six or more sexual partners over the preceding six months - and had not used a condom during sex
