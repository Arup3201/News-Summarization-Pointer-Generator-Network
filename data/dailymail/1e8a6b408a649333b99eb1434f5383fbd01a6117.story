A church has become an internet sensation after hundreds of people have flocked to see the face of a chicken within its walls.

With its large round windows resembling two eyes and roof tiles appearing as a beak, the so-called 'chicken church' is attracting an expanding fan club online.

The congregation at the Church by the Sea in Tampa Bay, Florida, say they regularly see passers-by stopping to get a memento of the unusual-looking building.

The church on Madeira Beach was founded in in 1944 by a group of fishermen.

It's light up cross has been used as a nautical landmark for the fisherman to guide them back to land.

While it was not intended to look like a chicken, the church's committee find the similarities highly comical.
