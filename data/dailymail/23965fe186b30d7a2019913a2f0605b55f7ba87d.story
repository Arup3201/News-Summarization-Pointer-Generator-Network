Twitter is constantly making tweaks and trialling new features with select users, but a recent interview with the site suggests major changes are afoot.

The vice president of product Kevin Weil and his counterpart in engineering Alex Roetter said that the future of the site hinges on videos, advanced private messaging and customised timelines.

This follows reports the social network is looking to replace long Twitter feeds with more relevant and personalised grid-style profiles.

Twitter's vice president of product Kevin Weil and his counterpart in engineering Alex Roetter said the future of the site hinges on videos, private messaging and customised timelines. Twitter recently launched video editing tools and this focus is set to continue. It could even add full-length films and live streams to timelines

Speaking to TechCrunch's Matthew Panzarino, Mr Roetter said: 'We spent a bunch of time doing research and really trying to understand our users.

'One thing we learned is  that when you get Twitter, it provides disproportionate value. 

'We’re very focused on making sure that we can get everyone into a place where they can see all the value and all the amazing content that exists only on Twitter.'

Mr Weil added: 'Anything you can do on your phone, you should be able to do on Twitter.'

Last month Twitter launched its much anticipated video service that lets users edit and upload clips up to 30 seconds long from its app.

This service runs alongside its six-second video app Vine. 

Elsewhere, Twitter recently added group direct messages (DMs) designed to take on the likes of WhatsApp. 

It lets people have private chats with multiple friends and followers, and this followed the launch of pictures and tweets being embedded into DMs.  

In terms of customised timelines, Twitter launched its 'While you were away' feature in January. 

It provides a recap of some of the top tweets a user might have missed from accounts they follow.

At the time, product manager Paul Rosania said: 'Our goal is to help you keep up - or catch up – with your world, no matter how much time you spend on Twitter.' 

Twitter is also said to be trialling a grid-style system with staff and select users.

With that in mind, the pair said Twitter is focusing on developing its video content on the site. 

Last month it launched its much anticipated video service that lets users edit and upload clips up to 30 seconds long from its app.

This service runs alongside its six-second video app Vine, and in the future these videos may include full feature-length films that could be purchased with Twitter's 'Buy' button, or even live streams of sporting or trending events, such as the Oscars.

Twitter's product director Jinen Kamdar recently told MailOnline the video service was expected to be particularly popular among the service's celebrity users.

'We think this will give people a whole new way to communicate on Twitter. 

'We think we've struck a balance that makes it easier for people to share, and it's not so long that people will be turned off'.

Mr Kamdar also confirmed the videos will not autoplay, but instead require users to click on then.

'Viewing and playing videos is just as simple: videos are previewed with a thumbnail and you can play them with just one tap.' 

'In just a few taps you can add a video to unfolding conversations, share your perspective of a live event, and show your everyday moments instantly, without ever having to leave the app.'

He said the move to video came as users wanted to expand their tweets.

The last major design change was in April 2014 when Twitter added Best Tweets, giving more precedence to tweets with higher levels of engagement, as well as Pinned Tweets that let people keep posts at the top of their page. Twitter is now said to be trialling a grid-style system with staff and select users

Following the last redesign (left), Twitter was heavily criticised for copying Facebook's layout (right). Twitter has previously said its ambition is to build 'the largest daily audience in the world,' and the changes expected to launch throughout 2015 have been designed to get people to engage with the site more frequently

'Tweets have been more than 140 characters for some time. 

'The Twitter you experience today is rich and immersive, full of images, GIFs, Vines, audio files and videos from some of the world’s most recognizable figures and brands.

Elsewhere, Twitter recently added group direct messages (DMs) designed to take on the likes of messaging apps such as Whatsapp. 

The feature lets people have private conversations with multiple friends and followers.

This followed the launch of pictures and tweets being embedded into DMs.

Mr Weil and Mr Roetter continued that Twitter is only 'just getting started on DMs' and the focus on this aspect of the site is set to continue. 

In terms of customised timelines, Twitter launched its 'While you were away' feature in January. 

It provides a recap of some of the top tweets a user might have missed from accounts they follow.

At the time, product manager Paul Rosania said: 'Our goal is to help you keep up - or catch up – with your world, no matter how much time you spend on Twitter.

'With a few improvements to the home timeline we think we can do a better job of delivering on that promise without compromising the real time nature of Twitter.'

This is also likely to continue and develop, according to TechCrunch's report. 

Mr Weil said that Twitter shouldn't be a 'one size fits all' experience and the way the site organises content and followers should be different for different users.

Twitter is said to be already trialling a grid-style system with staff and select users. 

The last major design change was made in April 2014 when Twitter added the Best Tweets feature, giving more precedence to tweets with higher levels of engagement, as well as Pinned Tweets that let people keep posts at the top of their page. 

At the time, this redesign was heavily criticised for copying Facebook's layout. 

Twitter has previously said its ambition is to build 'the largest daily audience in the world,' and the changes expected to launch throughout 2015 have been designed to get more people to use the service and to get the people already using the service to engage with it more frequently.
