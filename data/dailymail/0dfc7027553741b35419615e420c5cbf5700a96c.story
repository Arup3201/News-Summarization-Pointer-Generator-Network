A hostile bacteria, seen in Europe for the first time, is destroying centuries-old olive trees and threatening supplies of Italian oil.

The microbe, first identified in the Americas, has now infected 800,000 trees in Salento, the southern half of Puglia, the heel of Italy.

Puglia produces about 11million tonnes of olives a year, more than a third of the national crop and some of the country's best oils.

If supplies are significantly affected, it could lead to higher prices for shoppers in Britain and around the world (see box below).

Many of Italy's oldest specimens, some 500 years old, have been infected by the bacteria, named Xylella fastidiosa. 

The species causes plants to dry out, leaving shrivelled stumps that are incapable of bearing fruit.

The epidemic has already cost producers €250m (£200m) - a figure expected to rise.

Officials have called on experts from the University of California, Berkeley, to help them contain the devastating outbreak.

Angelo Corsetti, a spokesman for Coldiretti, the national agricultural organisation, said that growers would be forced to destroy many trees in the worst-afflicted areas when an emergency decree comes into force next week.

'The disease is continuing to spread thanks to the summer temperatures and we have to take the right measures.

'There will be a genuine "cordon sanitaire" of 8,000 hectares where it will be obligatory to destroy the trees'.

The reaction has been slow because of the Italian tradition of going on holiday for the whole of August. 

Unfortunately, 'Xylella does not go on holiday,' regional president of Coldiretti, Gianni Cantele, said

Anna Maria D'Onghia, head of plant protection at the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Bari, told the Corriere del Mezzorgiorno newspaper that the epidemic had never been seen in Europe before. 

She said insects are the likely cause of the transmission of the bacteria.

The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation has warned that the disease, which can also infect almond and stone fruit trees, is a 'very serious threat' to agriculture.
