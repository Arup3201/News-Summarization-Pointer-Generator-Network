Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has been accused of sexual assault - by the former exotic dancer who allegedly snapped the 71-year-old in a provocative position with two women in a hotel bathroom.

The Dallas Morning News reports that Jana Weckerly claims she was assaulted by the Cowboys owner in June 2009 after persistently rebuffing Jones' advances and is filing a lawsuit for more than $1million (£620,000) in damages.

She claims the alleged incident took place on the same night as she  took photographs of Jones before leaking them to gossip website TerezOwens.com in August.

Allegation: Ex-exotic dancer Jana Weckerly claims Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones sexually assaulted her

Compromised: Photos were leaked of Jones (right) with women in a hotel bathroom (the woman in this photo is not Jana Weckerly)

Leaked: Jones (right) with another female in a hotel in June 2009 (the woman in this photo is not Jana Weckerly)

Pictures: Jones was pictured in a hotel bathroom with two women (the woman in this photo is not Jana Weckerly)

Jones is also accused of attempting to cover up the assault by attempting to force Ms Weckerly to sign a waiver form.

The former exotic dancer's lawyer, Thomas Bowers, said in a statement to Deadspin: 'Weckerly maintained sobriety and managed to escape Jones' hotel room by convincing everyone to go dancing,

'As the night progressed and alcohol kicked in, Weckerly became increasingly uncomfortable and continued to refuse Jones' advances.' 

The lawyer of the Cowboys owner, however, says Jones vigorously denies the allegations.

Levi McCathern released a statement to Pro Football Talk which read: 'These allegations are completely false. The legal complaint is unsupported by facts or evidence of any kind.

'This is nothing more than an attempt to embarrass and extort Jerry Jones. This is a shakedown by a lawyer who is a solo practitioner just trying to make a name for himself. The alleged incidents would have been more than five years old.

'We intend to vigorously contest this complaint and expect it will be shown for what it is–a money grab. Due to the seriousness of these baseless allegations, we have also involved law enforcement.'
