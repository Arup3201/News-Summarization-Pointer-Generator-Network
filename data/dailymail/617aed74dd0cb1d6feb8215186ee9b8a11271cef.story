A computer guru and multi-millionaire who became the biggest single donor in the 900-year history of Oxford University has been found dead in the water off his private island home in Bermuda.

The body of Dr James Martin – who gave £100million ($150million) to Oxford more than a decade ago – was found floating in the water of Agar’s Island in Hamilton Harbour on Monday by a kayaker.

English-born Dr Martin, who was 79, became the author of more than 100 books and was a globally renowned speaker on the computer revolution after starting his career with computer giant IBM in the 1950s.

Dr Martin amassed his fortune from his books - many of which became best sellers - associated videos and lecture tours

One of his books, 1978’s The Wired Society which predicted the internet revolution, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.

Dr Martin was born in 
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, and attended Oxford’s Keble College before setting up several IT consultancy firms.

He had lived in Bermuda for many years, bought Agar’s Island in 1997 with US-born third wife Lillian and turned it into his private sanctuary.

The island home features a 300-year-old temple brought from Bali and incorporated features of the former British Army barracks and gunpowder store dating from the 19th century.

Dr Martin, who amassed his fortune from his books (many of which became best sellers), associated videos and lecture tours, pledged £65million to Oxford in 2005 to set up a school to study the problems of the 21st century.

Dr Martin wrote The Meaning Of The 21st Century: A Vital Blueprint For Ensuring Our Future, which was published in 2006 and featured interviews with prominent scientists, philosophers and politicians

In 2010, he offered another £35million in matching funds, which meant that for every £650,000 ($1million) pledged by another donor, he would match it with the same amount.

According to an article in The Independent in 2011, he was inspired to set up what became the Oxford Martin School in the wake of 9/11.

He told the Independent: ‘I was getting more and more concerned about the problems of the planet.

‘The idea behind the school was to say that all of these subjects needed research of a very high quality and on all of them there would have to be multi-disciplinary research. Yet there was almost no multi-disciplinary research going on in universities.’

He wrote The Meaning of the 21st Century: A Vital Blueprint for Ensuring Our Future, which was published in 2006 and featured interviews with prominent scientists, philosophers and politicians.

The book was later made into a documentary, narrated by Bermuda neighbour and film star Michael Douglas.

Despite his wealth, Dr Martin lived a quiet life but was prominent in local society and regularly delivered lectures on the island in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Staff at the Oxford Martin School have paid tribute to the entrepreneur.

The school’s director, Professor Ian Goldin, said: 'The Oxford Martin School embodies Jim’s concern for humanity, his creativity, his curiosity, and his optimism.

'Jim provided not only the founding vision but was intimately involved with the school and our many programmes.

'We have lost a towering intellect, guiding visionary and a wonderful close friend.'   Professor Andrew Hamilton, Oxford’s Vice-Chancellor also paid tribute to Dr Martin.

'James Martin was a true visionary whose exceptional generosity established the Oxford Martin School, allowing researchers from across the disciplines to work together on the most pressing challenges and opportunities facing humanity,' he said.

'His impact will be felt for generations to come, as through the school he has enabled researchers to address the biggest questions of the 21st century.'

The school, which houses 15 institutes which examine subjects such as ageing, energy materials, particle therapy and ethics, was set up in 2005 after an initial donation from Dr Martin.

'James Martin was an inspiration to millions - an extraordinary intellect, with wide-ranging interests, boundless energy and an unwavering commitment to addressing the greatest challenges facing humanity,' said a statement released by the learning centre.

'The school is his permanent legacy and a fitting tribute - a flourishing, vibrant community of the world’s leading minds, coming together to change the world for the better.

Dr Martin's lifeless body was found floating in the waters of the Great Sound near Agar's Island in Bermuda

'He enjoyed the excitement and happy atmosphere of the school, and his kind and unfailingly courteous manner was greatly appreciated by all who spent time with him.'

'The Bermuda Police Service can now confirm the death of 79-year-old Dr James Martin,' said a police spokesman.

'Dr Martin’s lifeless body was found floating in the waters of the Great Sound near Agar’s Island around 5.30pm Monday, June 24 by a kayaker.

'An investigation into the circumstances surrounding Dr Martin’s death is ongoing, however at this time there does not appear to be any suspicious circumstances.

'A family liaison officer has been assigned to Dr Martin’s family to assist them at this tragic time.

'The Bermuda Police Service extends condolences to the family and friends of Dr Martin on his passing.'
