A woman who once tipped the scales at 600lbs has opened up about how she lost more than half her body weight thanks to Weight Watchers and a nutritionist.

Val McLeod from Savannah, Georgia, told WSBTV Atlanta that she used to be so big, she couldn't fit into store-bought clothes, so she made her own out of upholstery fabric.

'I was just this mammoth person,' said Ms McLeod, who now works as a clinical therapist and motivational speaker. 'I would roll out as many yards as I needed and put elastic in the waistband.'

Before and after: At her heaviest, Val McLeod from Savannah, Georgia, was so big, she couldn't fit into store-bought clothes, so she made her own out of upholstery fabric

Looking back: 'I was just this mammoth person,' said Ms McLeod, who now works as a clinical therapist and motivational speaker. 'I would roll out as many yards as I needed and put elastic in the waistband'

Overweight since childhood, Ms McLeod said she used to binge on cookies, chips and ice cream, with no concept of portion control.

Her turning point came more than 20 
years ago when she went to the hospital to undergo gastric bypass and 
suffered a medical emergency during surgery that saw her on life support for three days.

'I
 was committed at that moment to say, "I will never, ever do anything 
else to continue to destroy my life,"' she explained.

After that, she made a resolution to slim down the natural way, through diet and exercise.

She began following a low-fat 
diet of mostly fruits and vegetables, walking four to five miles a
 day and going to the gym three times a week for strength training.

'Looking
 back, I probably didn't even need to try the surgery,' she told 
Savannah Now. 'But you don't know that when you're so desperate.'

Turning point: About 20 years ago, she began following a low-fat diet of mostly fruits and vegetables, walking four to five miles a day and going to the gym three times a week

New outlook: Her fridge is now stocked with fresh produce instead of junk food, which she looks at as more of a lifestyle choice than a short-term diet or solution

Today,
 Val McLeod has lost 370lbs and is a mere shadow of her former morbidly 
obese self. She was even featured in People magazine's weight loss 
issue, which inspired her to shed even more weight.

'I never dreamed that I'd have a waistline,' she confessed.

'I'm so much more empowered now to 
empower other women about what they can do, because I still had to lose 
it very slowly, pound by pound,' she added.

Inspirational: 'I start my day with a declaration about my health, my fitness, about my future and how synergized those two concepts are. That I won't have a future without being more fit'

Ms McLeod still plans to lose about 50lbs more, with the ultimate goal of fitting into a size-14 suit that she purchased 15 years ago.

And she hopes her story of willpower and determination will inspire others to achieve their goals, too.

'Release the resistance, let go of the 
limitations,' she said. 'Because it's a lie, you absolutely can do it!

'I start my day
 with a declaration about my health, my fitness, about my future and how
 synergized those two concepts are. That I won't have a future without 
being more fit.'
