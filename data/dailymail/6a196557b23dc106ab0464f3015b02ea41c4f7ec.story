The Democratic National Committee chairwoman has found herself in hot water after making controversial statements, comparing the Republican  governor of Wisconsin to an abuser.

At a round-table discussion on women's issues in Milwaukee on Wednesday, Debbie Wasserman Schultz ridiculed Gov Scott Walker's gender policies, saying he gives 'women the back of his hand'. 

Walker is currently in the middle of heated re-election against Democratic candidate Mary Burke. It's unclear yet, whether these latest statements by Burke's party leader will impact the race significantly, in Walker's favor.

Congresswoman Schultz was criticizing Scott's opposition to a minimum wage increase and support for a bill which would prevent people claiming employment discrimination from seeking damages in state court. 

'Scott Walker has given women the back of his hand. I know that is stark. I know that is direct. I know that is reality,' Schultz said Wednesday.

'What Republican tea party extremists like Scott Walker are doing is they are grabbing us by the hair and pulling us back. It is not going to happen on our watch,' she added.

The Republican National Committee pounced on Schultz comments, and issued a statement saying it was a 'new low for an already flailing Democratic Party'. 

'This is a sad attempt to gain political points that’s offensive to victims of abuse and well beneath the chair of a major political party,' RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said in a statement.

'Mary Burke should denounce the leader of her party or explain why she’s standing by as Democrats mislead Wisconsin voters.' 

A spokesman for Burke did respond with a statement to FoxNews.com, saying it was not the kind of language the candidate herself would have used. 

The DNC also reacted, explaining that Schultz was in no way trying to belittle domestic violence.

'Domestic violence is an incredibly serious issue and the Congresswoman was by no means belittling the very real pain survivors experience,' DNC spokesman Lily Adams said. 'That's why Democrats have consistently supported the Violence Against Women Act and won’t take a lesson from the party that blocked and opposed its reauthorization. The fact of the matter is that Scott Walker’s policies have been bad for Wisconsin’s women.'

Walker and Burke are running in one of the closest gubernatorial races this year, with both switching back and forth in the lead according to recent polls. 

A poll published in late August by Marquette University showed Burke up 2 percentage points, while an older poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports found Walker up a single point. 

Walked is also considered a potential Republican contender in the 2016 presidential election.
