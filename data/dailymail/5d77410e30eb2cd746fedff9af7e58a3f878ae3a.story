A convicted drink-driver who drove the wrong way down a dual carriageway and ploughed into a car killing a 'besotted' young couple who planned to marry has been jailed for eight years.

William Wilson, 33, crashed head-on with Stephen Donnelly, 26, and his girlfriend Mandy Gold, 21 as they returned from a family wedding.

The young churchgoers from Sheffield were travelling along the A14 in Northamptonshire on their way home.

Tragedy: 'Dreadful' drink-driver William Wilson ploughed into besotted young couple Stephen Donnelly, 26, and his girlfriend Mandy Gold, 21 when he drove on the wrong side of the road

Wilson, of Brigg in South Humberside, was twice the drink drive limit, having drunk equivalent of up to four pints, and had been seen slowing down, accelerating and clipping kerbs before he killed the couple.

He pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and to drink driving at Northampton Crown Court.

Judge Richard Bray said: 'This is a tragic case in which the lives of two young people have been lost. No penalty can compensate for these sad deaths.

'This was a dreadful course of dangerous driving. You drove on the wrong side of the carriageway and they had no chance of avoiding instant death.'

Todd Roberts, a friend of the young couple and a senior pastor at the church, said following the tragedy: 'They were a devoted couple, they were besotted with each.'

Wilson was returning home from a traveller's fair when the collision occurred on June 27.

Alexandra Bull, prosecuting, said a couple, saw Stephen and Mandy's Ford car move into the outside lane to overtake when they heard a massive bang.

She said: 'The witness saw two people trapped in the car. Wilson, who appeared dazed, said "What have I done?".

Message: Jailing Wilson for eight years Judge Richard Bray said: 'No penalty can compensate for these sad deaths'

The pair were went on a missionary trip to Poland together last year and friends said they were 'young and in love'.

Stephen, a former pure mathematics student at the University of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, joined the church in 2007 and became part of its staff as a student pastor a year later.

Volunteer Mandy was a student life group leader at the church and also helped out with Sunday school and women's Bible groups.

Gwyn Lewis, representing Wilson, who is from a traveller family, said: 'This is a tragic case for the families whose lives were changed in an instant.

'They suffered a tragic loss which they have dealt with in a very dignified manner. No sentence, no matter what type or length, can lessen the anguish of these families.

'This will remain a jigsaw that doesn't fit and a mystery he will never, ever understand,' he added.

'He is genuinely remorseful and has written to both bereaved families. He struggles with the consequences of his actions.

'It's the first thing he thinks of in the morning and the last thing he thinks of at night. He unequivocally accepts responsibility.'

Wilson, who was convicted of drink driving when he was 17, was banned from driving for 10 years.
