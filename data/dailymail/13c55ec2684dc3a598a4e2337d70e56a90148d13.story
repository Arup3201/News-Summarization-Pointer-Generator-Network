Champagne shipments to Britain plummeted last year as consumers switched to cheaper alternatives such as prosecco, a report has revealed.

Volume sales were down 5.1 per cent and value sales dropped 3.8 per cent, according to the UK Champagne Bureau.

And latest research shows that sales of cheaper sparkling wines including prosecco and cava soared over the same period.

Demand: Despite the dismal trading figures, Britain remains the top export destination of the Champagne region in France (pictured)

UK Champagne Bureau director Francoise Peretti told Off Licence News: ‘The UK Champagne market is typically procyclical, with a pronounced tendency to late reaction.

‘It is not unusual to see the consequences of an economic downturn maybe one or two years after the event.’

Meanwhile, sparkling wine excluding Champagne grew 8 per cent in volume and 15 per cent in value to £464million in the off-trade.

It commands an average price of £9.01, whereas Champagne sells for an average of £25.92.

In the on-trade sparkling wine such as Prosecco and Cava grew 11 per cent in volume and 18 per cent in value.

But despite the dismal trading figures, Britain remains the top export destination of the Champagne region in France.

'The UK has been Champagne's number one export market for the past 18 years, and that is not about to change'

Francoise Peretti, UK Champagne Bureau director

It exported 136.6million bottles in 2013, and 30.8million were shipped to Britain - 72 per cent ahead of the world's second largest export market, the US. Exports totalled £371million.

Ms Peretti added: ‘The UK has been Champagne's number one export market for the past 18 years, and that is not about to change.

‘Market optimism combined with the tremendous buoyancy we are seeing in the on-trade leaves me in no doubt that the UK will remain number one among Champagne export markets for a very long time to come.’

Looking for a cheaper alternative to Champagne? Here are some of the Mail's favourite proseccos:

Follador Superiore 2012 Extra Dry, £15

A
 pretty, pale gold wine with excellent effervescence providing lots of 
movement on the palate. Floral-scented, with a hint of elderflower in 
the flavour.

Verdict: A luxurious wine that looked and tasted 
superior to many of the others. At the same price as cheap Champagne, 
this is more than a match for its French rival. Best for prosecco
 connoisseurs.

Bella Cucina Prosecco Extra Dry, £6.99

A
 pale coloured wine, lacking the subtle sunshine tint typical in a 
prosecco.

Didn’t bubble as pleasingly as some of the others 
but the warm, toasty flavours of this sweeter wine were delightful.

Verdict: Great-looking rustic bottle and enough character to want to pour another glass. Best for everyday Italian dinners.

Prosecco Superiore Extra Dry (Valdobbiadene),  £7.29

A
 pleasant straw colour, with a slight earthy scent and light, sweet 
citrus flavours.

But it lacks the classic flowery tones that would have 
given the wine more character.

Verdict: Good value, but the flavours are a little too faint.

Majestic Wine — Prosecco Zonin Brut, £11.99

The
 most vigorous fizzer of all, with fast-moving bubbles that prickled on 
the palate.

The flavour is not that of a classic prosecco — more like a 
rounded, dry white wine.

Verdict: All the vitality and quality you need in a party wine. Best when you want to impress
