Great artworks sometimes come in an unexpected form.

A Chinese university professor has created a series of vivid portraits of well-known figures using tiny pieces of jeans, reported the People's Daily Online. 

The largest of all, an image of a Buddha, measures two metres (6.6ft) in height and comprises more than 10,000 pieces of denim.

Wang Xiaolei, an associate professor at Wuhan Textile University, started creating what he calls ‘denim paintings’ after visiting a town in China in 2007 which specialised in processing off-cut cloth pieces but had a terrible effect on the surrounding environment in doing so.

Creativity: Wang Xiaolei, working on a portrait of Audrey Hepburn, embarked on the unusual endeavour of 'painting' with unwanted denim after witnessing how scrap cloth factories destroy the environment

Variety: Mr Wang's paintings cover a wide range of figures from Chairman Mao to David Beckham (centre)

His interest was strengthen after an academic visit to the University of Manchester in 2008, during which he learned more ways of recycling scrap cloth.

Since then, Mr Wang has collected tens of thousands of old jeans for experimenting with his art. He says denim has a three-dimensional quality so it is easy to make shapes with.

To make a portrait, he first cuts jeans into large pieces and separates these pieces into different colour shadings. 

Then he goes into a trail-and-error stage of setting out the outlines and establishing the different shades of colours of the particular picture, and this could take more than 100 alterations to get right.

Fashion: Mr Wang's unique style has created a trend among his students at Wuhan Textile University who regularly paint with him in the studio. In this picture, he is holding a portrait of Andy Lau, a renowned singer and actor from Hong Kong

Effort: To set the correct outlines and colour tones of a painting sometimes takes more than 100 alterations

Mr Wang creates portraits of a range of Chinese and international figures, including Chairman Mao, Fan Bingbing, David Beckham, Michael Jackson, Audrey Hepburn and Leonardo Dicaprio.

His wife Taohui, who also collaborates on him with his ‘denim painting’, says Mr Wang is so absorbed in his work that he spent one New Year’s eve in his studio.

Extended periods of concentration on these denim collages, separating the cloth into almost identical shades of colour, has also resulted in his eyes almost always being bloodshot.

Mr Wang’s hard work finally paid off when his paintings attracted the attention of a director of the Cultural University of Japan, who invited the denim warrior to hold an exhibition in Japan.

He has also produced portraits for the eight invited guest speakers at the World Textile Conference last November.

Landscape: Apart from portraits, Mr Wang also creates landscape pictures with denim such as the one pictured above

Home decor: Chairs have also had the denim treatment from Mr Wang
