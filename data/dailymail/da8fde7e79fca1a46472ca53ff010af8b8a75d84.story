England goalkeeper Joe Hart has revealed that nobody at Manchester City has contacted him about a new contract — prompting fears the club might try to sell him next summer.

Hart has spent the last few weeks watching team-mates David Silva, Vincent Kompany and Sergio Aguero sign lucrative new deals.

But the 27-year-old international, whose current contract has less than two years to run, has heard nothing from the club’s hierarchy.

Hart confirmed ahead of Sunday's big Premier League clash against Chelsea: ‘Anything about a new contract is news to me. I’ve heard nothing. I’ve got a year, nearly two years, left on my deal. That is all I am aware of.’

Negotiations between clubs and their most important players would normally be underway entering the last two years of an existing contract.

Privately, Hart is worried about what might be causing the delay even though there would be no shortage of suitors — including Liverpool — if he were to become available.

Hart was dropped by manager Manuel Pellegrini for two months last season after a mistake cost City a defeat at Chelsea.

Manuel Pellegrini has attempted to put Hart's fears to rest by saying: 'I'm sure everything will be sorted out'

He bounced back to win his second Premier League title in three seasons and play for England in the World Cup but Pellegrini spent £6 million on goalkeeper Willy Caballero last summer and made no promises to Hart about remaining first-choice.

Hart was outstanding against Bayern Munich on Wednesday night but accepts he has to keep playing out of his skin to have a future at the club.

Asked about having a rival in Caballero, he said: ‘I can’t moan about it and I can’t be too happy about it. It is the situation and if I want to stay at this club it’s going to be the reality forever.

Hart may fear being sold on by Pellegrini if his new contract isn't sorted out soon

‘I appreciate it more than anyone that we now have at least two quality players for every single position and the goalkeeping department is no different.

‘I’m sure he’ll get chances to play games, just as I will, and we’ve got to get on with it.’

Pellegrini tried to give assurances over a contract on Saturday night by saying: ‘I am sure something will be sorted out with Joe.’
