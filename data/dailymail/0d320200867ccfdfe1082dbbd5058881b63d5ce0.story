Midfielder Jordan Henderson is desperate to hit back at Liverpool's critics after an indifferent run of form. He sees the Bernabeu as an ideal place to put in a performance and win back the doubters.

Liverpool face Real Madrid on Tuesday evening having won just one of their opening three Champions League games.

Real are on a fine run of form, winning 11 on the trot, while Liverpool are stuttering in the Premier League sitting in seventh place.

But Henderson believes Tuesday could be a turning point.

He said: 'We have got people criticising us, we know we are not at our best but this is a great opportunity to show that we are a top side.

'We just need to be a bit more ruthless in the final third. We need to be more ruthless and more creative. We are working hard to create chances.

'We feel we are coming to a brilliant stadium and we want to put on a performance.'

Henderson is also insistent than Steven Gerrard will be a Liverpool star for years to come.

He added: 'He is a massive player for us he is our captain, our leader, role model. Hopefully he will be a big player for many years to come.'
