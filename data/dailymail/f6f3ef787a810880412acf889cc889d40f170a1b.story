A career criminal has been jailed for the fifth time after committing his 200th burglary.

Nathan Hibberd, 39, broke down into tears as he was sentenced to another lengthy sentence behind bars after already having served four long jail terms.

Frustrated judge  Jamie Tabor QC told Hibberd it appeared no amount of jail time could reform him.

He said: 'I can’t stop you with whatever jail sentence I impose, unless it is life, which I’m not entitled to do.

'If you are going to stop it’s got to come from you and no one else.'

Career criminal Nathan Hibberd has been jailed for the fifth time after committing his 200th burglary but frustrated Judge Jamie Tabor said he didn't think the sentence would stop him from committing further crime

Gloucester Crown Court heard how Hibberd's life of crime stretching back more than 20 years has caused 'untold misery' to his victims.

His first house burglary was in 1992. He was first jailed for three and a half years in 1999 for 62 burglaries, for four years in 2001 for 54 burglaries, and for four-and-a-quarter years in 2005 for 41 burglaries.

He was jailed again in 2009 for four-and-a-half years after admitting 42 burglaries in Gloucester.

Hibberd was caught red-handed committing his latest crimes on July 16 when he broke into a home in Kingsholm, Gloucester, and another in Wotton, Gloucester, and stole jewellery.

He then went on the run and a manhunt was launched on July 19 by officers, with a reward of £1,000 offered by Crimestoppers.

Shocked residents spotted him cowering in a garden in Tuffley, Gloucester, the next day. He was captured by officers after climbing on to the roof of a house nearby.

Hibberd, from Matson, Gloucester, pleaded guilty to two counts of dwelling burglary.

Back in court: Hibberd was jailed to three and a half years in prison for each of the two burglaries to run concurrently at Glopucester Crown Court

Judge Tabor said: 'You have been before this court on many occasions, many occasions, for burglary.

'Yet again you have caused untold misery by breaking into peoples houses.

'I don’t think the victims have exaggerated when they said they were frightened and feel absolutely outraged.

'You were caught red-handed. You have been jailed in the past and now it’s up to you. Enough is enough.'

Sniffing back tears, Hibberd responded: 'I’m trying, sir.'

Judge Tabor said: 'You may be, but breaking into people’s houses shows you are not trying hard enough.'

He sentenced him to three and half years for both burglaries, to run concurrently, and said: 'Get off the drugs inside.

'Come out changed and I hope the probation service will help to provide you with an environment where you are not tempted to do it again.'

Hibberd was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £150.
