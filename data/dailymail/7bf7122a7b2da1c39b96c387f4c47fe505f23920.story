Former High Court judge Baroness Butler-Sloss today rejected criticism of her appointment to lead an inquiry into claims of an Establishment cover-up of child sex abuse, despite her brother being in the Cabinet at the time.

She is to lead a panel of experts investigating allegations that politicians, the police, the judiciary, celebrities, the BBC, the NHS and the Church conspired to cover-up abuse over several decades.

But her brother, Sir Michael Havers, sat in the Conservative Cabinet as attorney general from 1979-87, the period in which much of the alleged abuse is said to have taken place.

Downing Street refused to comment on whether Baroness Butler-Sloss's family connections were considered before announcing her appointment.

Sir Michael was accused of a 'cover-up' in the early 1980s over a refusal to prosecute Foreign Office diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, who was a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange.

Sir Michael, who died in 1992, is said to have had a 20 minute argument outside the Commons chamber with Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in the 1980s in an attempt to stop him using parliamentary privilege to name diplomat Sir Peter  as a paedophile.

Today Baroness Butler-Sloss brushed off the controversy this morning, telling the BBC: 'I know absolutely nothing about it,' she told the BBC. 'If people think I am not suitable, then that's up to them.'

Baroness 
Butler-Sloss has faced calls to step down after reports that Sir Michael
 tried to prevent ex-MP Geoffrey Dickens airing claims about a diplomat 
in Parliament in the 1980s. 

Labour
 MP Simon Danczuk, who has led his own inquiry into abuse carried out by
 former Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith, said: 'We want somebody in the chair
 that exudes confidence and that’s not the case. 

'She’s
 part of the establishment and that raises concerns and the relationship
 in terms of her brother, I think, is too close for comfort. I think 
that’s the conclusion most people will reach,' he told the BBC.

Mr Danczuk said she should 'consider her position', adding: 'I think she should consider her position. I find it quite surprising that neither she nor the Government realised that her relationship with her brother was connected with Geoffrey Dickens and all this palaver around it. 

'It beggars belief that that hadn’t been considered in the first place.'

Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, also said he was 'surprised that the Government has chosen a Member of the House of Lords no matter how distinguished to head the inquiry'.

He added: 'She is a member of Parliament and is very closely related to a former Lord Chancellor.' 

Conservative Sarah Wollaston, who chairs the Commons health select committee, said she did not doubt the peer's integrity but it was 'hard to see why Baroness Butler-Sloss would want to accept a role so many regard as conflicted at the outset'.

Alison Millar, head of the abuse team at law firm Leigh Day, which represents alleged victims of abuse at institutions that will be examined by the inquiry, said: 'Whilst Lady Butler-Sloss is a person of enormous integrity, the concern really is that she is just too close to the establishment and, in particular, concern over her family connection to Sir Michael Havers.

'Justice must be seen to be done by those who are understandably the most reticent to come forward, those who have survived abuse.

'The panel needs to be reconsidered and must involve those working in the area of child abuse as well as survivors of abuse now working in that area.'

But the government rallied round Baroness Butler-Sloss, a former president of the Family Division of the High Court who chaired the Cleveland Child Abuse Inquiry. 

Labour MP Simon Danczuk said Baroness Butler-Sloss should consider her position while Tory MP Sarah Wollaston said her appointment was 'conflicted at the outset' 

Harriet Harman today called for the child sex abuse inquiry to examine links between a civil liberties group she used to work for and the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange.

Labour’s deputy leader worked as legal officer for the National Council for Civil Liberties between 1978 and 1982, when PIE was one of its affiliates.

Ms Harman said Baroness Butler-Sloss's inquiry should 'obviously' look into PIE.

She told BBC Radio 4: 'The thing about PIE, which was so pernicious about it, is that they infiltrated organisations, so they infiltrated social work organisations, they infiltrated even the Home Office as it turns out, and obviously that is deeply regrettable.

'What they did is they said they were just for free speech and talking about sexual identity, but actually what they were doing was covering up for their own evil child abuse.

'So, yes, I'm sure that the whole issue of PIE will be looked at in this inquiry. They were a very evil organisation.'

Shown a picture of an advert for the NCCL in a PIE magazine from the 1970s, she said: 'Obviously it is very regrettable that they even existed and peddled that line of argument, but worst of all that they were perpetrating abuse.'

The Home Office said Lady Butler-Sloss's integrity was 'beyond reproach' and it stood 'unreservedly' by her appointment.

The Prime Minister also insisted she was the right person to lead the inquiry. Mr Cameron's official spokesman told a Westminster media briefing: 'She commands the very highest respect for her professional expertise and integrity.

'His view is that she does command widespread respect and confidence, and rightly so.'

However, Mr Cameron's spokesman declined to say whether Lady Butler-Sloss's relationship to Lord Havers had been discussed during the process of picking an inquiry chair.

'The focus was on finding a person with the right expertise and integrity,' said the Prime Minister's spokesman. 'That's exactly what we have in Elizabeth Butler-Sloss.'

Asked whether Mr Cameron considered her family relationships relevant to her appointment, the spokesman said: 'There has been no change in the Government's and the Prime Minister's view about her suitability for the role.'

Actor Nigel Havers, Sir Michael's son and nephew of  Baroness Butler-Sloss, also defended her appointment.

He told BBC Radio 4: 'I know my aunt very well, and had she felt any form of bias or idea that she shouldn't be doing this inquiry, she would have pulled out this morning. 

'The very fact that she hasn't means, to me, that she feels absolutely no political ties to my father and knew nothing about what was going on in the House of Commons at that time and therefore she has every right I think to continue to do the inquiry.' 

The Home Office said Lady Butler-Sloss's integrity was 'beyond reproach' and it stood 'unreservedly' by her appointment.

And in a written statement to MPs, Mrs May said: 'Baroness Butler-Sloss brings with her many years of experience in the field of child protection and law, and I am confident that she will deliver the thorough, robust and independent review that I have promised.

'To ensure that the terms of reference for the inquiry are sufficient to deliver the robust review which is required, I have asked that Lady Butler-Sloss agree the final terms of reference with the full panel, when appointed. 

'The inquiry will begin its work as soon as possible after the appointment of other members of the panel and I shall provide a further update in due course.'
