Franck Ribery claims the Ballon d'Or is a waste of time for Bayern Munich players, admitting  he was 'really upset' when team-mate Manuel Neuer didn't scoop the top gong.

Cristiano Ronaldo won this year's crown while he and Lionel Messi have shared the last seven awards between them.

And Ribery, who was in the running last year, believes that Bayern players should consider not turning up to the event in Zurich in the future just to take pictures , as the 'third nominated player has no chance'.

Manuel Neuer missed out on the award this month, Ribery believes players are now only there for 'photos'

Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi have won the top gong since 2008 - Ribery says the third man has no hope

Neuer is regarded as the best goalkeeper in the world and had a sparkling year with Bayern Munich

'I was really upset. But it's the same every year: You do not know what you have to do to win this election,' the 31-year-old told German magazine AZ Munchen.

'Every player needs to know: if Ronaldo and Messi are there, the third player doesn't have a chance.

'When another Bayern player gets nominated, we should have a discussion whether it's even worth going. What's the point? To get your picture taken? It's just politics for me.'

Manuel Neuer was a rank outsider for the award as a goalkeeper, even though he starred at the World Cup last summer as Germany lifted the trophy.

And Ribery believes this should be enough.

'Neuer has been the best goalkeeper in the world over the last two or three years, He has won titles with the club. 

'In Brazil, he was the best goalkeeper and has become world champion. This is obviously not enough.'
