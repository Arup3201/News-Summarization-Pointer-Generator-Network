They have become a tourist attraction in their own right, taken into the hearts of visitors to the beauty spot.

So popular is this family of boar that they have managed to avoid the chop in the Forest of Dean's culling programme. But not for much longer, as they could only have a few months left to live before being slaughtered.

This particular group of six have been given a death sentence after the Forestry Commission decided they would no longer be excluded from the cull - a move which is expected to spark outcry among their fans.

Death sentence: Some of the Beechenhurst Six graze near the visitor center near Cinderford, blissfully unaware of the fate that could await them

Out on a limb: Forestry Commission bosses have confirmed the boars' exclusion from previous culls will come to an end in March next year

The animals have become a firm 
favourite with visitors to the Gloucestershire beauty spot's 
Beechenhurst tourist centre near Cinderford.

The
boar - dubbed the Beechenhurst Six - are often seen grubbing for food 
in the grounds surrounding the tourist centre, and have built up quite a
following.

So far they have been spared from any culling by the Forestry Commission over to concerns at opposition to the move.

However
Forestry Commission bosses have now confirmed their exclusion from 
previous culls will come to an end in March next year.

A
spokesman said: 'A decision was taken back in the summer, when local 
people were focused on this particular family of boar, not to cull them 
as part of the overall cull of wild boar.

'A
new cull target will be set in March 2012 based upon the best available
information. It does not follow that these particular animals will be 
either targeted or not targeted in 2012/13.'

Common problems: The Forest of Dean has long had a population of wild boar (pictured) but environmentalists have called for a closed season on hunting the boar to help them flourish

Pricey problem: It costs the Forestry Commission £50,000 a year to cull boar in Dean

Cinderford's Labour councillor Graham Morgan, said: 'There could well be a public outcry if that family of boar is culled.

'People have taken them into their hearts. The thing is, people have been feeding them, which then domesticates them.

'People would help them more by not feeding them. They get too familiar with people if they get fed, and that’s when the problems start.'

He added: 'I personally think the cull 
was too heavy to start off with. We want wild boar in the Forest and 
they need to be managed, but perhaps there weren’t as many as the 
Forestry Commission first thought.

'I think they need to take two steps back and look again at how the population is managed.'

The selection of cull animals on Forestry Commission-managed land by its professional wildlife ranger staff takes into account many factors before handing out death sentences.

This includes the degree of nuisance, perception of levels of aggression, population dynamics and perceived population densities in any given area.

Culling for 2011/12 was completed by the end of September 2011, so, except for the removal of animals for animal welfare reasons, this year’s cull has stopped.

During the most recent census, using night-vision technology, only 16 boar were counted despite the Commission previously claiming there were around 350 roaming the Forest.

The census, when completed early next year, will help form the Forestry Commission’s cull target for 2012.

Meanwhile, environmentalists in the Dean have been calling for a closed season on hunting the boar to help them flourish.

It costs the Forestry Commission £50,000 a year to cull boar in Dean.
