Tucked away under a grassy hill, at first glance this incredible subterranean house could have stepped off the pages of The Hobbit, but look a little closer and rather than Bilbo Baggins's quaint cosy cottage it in fact bears more resemblance to a James Bond villain's underground lair.

Dubbed Walnut Burrow - a name which somewhat betrays its state of the art design - the £2.5million home in Loudwater, Hertfordshire, took 18 months to build with developers having to excavate 5,000 tons of soil before work could get underway.

The one-of-a-kind dwelling has four 
bedrooms, all of which are en-suite, a huge living room, dining room and
 kitchen, a cinema and a central courtyard.

And
 all of this is hidden hidden below ground level - with the developers 
behind the brand-new home given the strict task of building a property 
out of sight of the neighbours.

Underground: Tucked away under a grassy hill, at first glance this 
incredible subterranean house in Loudwater, Hertfordshire, could have 
stepped off the pages of The Hobbit

Modern: Look a little closer and rather than Bilbo Baggins's quaint cosy cottage it in fact bears more resemblance to a James Bond villain's state-of-the art underground lair

All mod cons: The one-of-a-kind dwelling has four bedrooms, all of which are en-suite, a huge living room, dining room and kitchen, a cinema and a central courtyard

Secret: Most of the home is hidden hidden below ground level - with the developers behind the brand-new home given the strict task of building a property out of sight of the neighbours

Lighten up: To keep natural daylight, the house has a 45-foot long south facing expanse of glass which serves the kitchen, dining and living areas, opening onto a sunken courtyard

Unique: The home, which was recently finished, has been put up for sale 
for £2.5 million with estate agents Savills describing it as 'stylish 
and unique underground home'

Amazing: 'It is the most amazing and unique house which I have had the pleasure of selling,' said Sue Trybus, from Savills

View from below: 'Even though it is underground, the amount of light it unbelievable,' said Ms Trybus. 'There is a lovely courtyard which acts as a suntrap'

Out to impress: Ms trybus said the house would be ideal for a professional footballer, or a celebrity who is looking for something architecturally impressive

Night in: Homeowners would not need to pop to the nearest multiplex to catch a movie as the house has its own cinema, complete with a nine-foot screen

Cooking up a storm: The home has programmable lighting, solar panels and a state-of-the-art heat recovery and ventilation system, while amateur chefs would love the bespoke German kitchen

Entrance: An oak front door opens into the hall with contemporary cloakroom. The main reception room and kitchen have sliding doors to a lit courtyard

Floor plan: The rooms of the luxury home are positioned around the central courtyard and there is a large open plan kitchen and living area

In process: Walnut Burrow was built using a waterproof reinforced concrete box set into the hill. The roof was then turfed over, to create the garden

Wasteland: The site in Loudwater before work began on the incredible property, which took a year and a half to complete
