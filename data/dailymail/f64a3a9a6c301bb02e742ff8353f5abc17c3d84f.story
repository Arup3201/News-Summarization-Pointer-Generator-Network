When Rachel Kelly was born in 1977, her future husband Mike was already 33 years old. 

The couple both went through a marriage and had children with their previous spouses before finally falling in love seven years ago.

The age gap and timing of their union rocked the religious community they were part of so strongly that they were forced to leave their local church, where Mike was volunteering as a pastor, and join a different congregation.

But almost decade later and the Lancastrian couple are stronger than ever, with two children of their own, Aiden, four and Natasha, six.

They also live with Rachel's two children from her first marriage, Kayleigh, ten, and Jessica, 12. 

Make and Rachel Kelly started dating when she was 30 and he was was 63. Seven years later they are married with two children.

The first few years of their romance were not such plain sailing though. 

After meeting through the local church, Rachel and Mike remained just friends for several years while she was married to her first husband. 

But as her first relationship crumbled, Rachel turned to Mike for advice and assistance in leaving her partner. 

She said: 'My husband had gone out with the children, something had happened and I just thought to myself that I'd had enough.

'I rang Mike and asked if he could find me somewhere to stay.

'He picked me up, rang round his friends and found me somewhere.

'He took a week off work and helped out and just generally was was fantastic.'

And before long, Mike's chivalrous behaviour meant Rachel started to see him as more than just a friend. 

She said: 'I wasn't looking for love and so was very surprised when I found I had feelings for Mike. 

'But I had never been treated so well, so respected, for someone treat me so well without expecting anything back.' 

Mike, who had been single for fifteen years after splitting from his first wife, admits that he was already holding a torch for Rachel by this time and couldn't believe it when his feelings started to be reciprocated. 

He told This Morning:  'She was a friend in crisis, but there was also an attraction - I'd always fancied her a bit - for several years before we got together

'I was of course I was surprised (when she liked me), because well, look at me.

'I always say I look like an oil painting, something like Picasso.'

Rachel and Mike Kelly have a 33 year age gap, but they are happily married in a romance that has lasted seven years

The couple didn't have long to adjust to their new relationship - just six weeks after they started dating, Rachel fell pregnant. 

She said: 'My first husband and I had struggled to conceive with my eldest two children and with (Mike) being so old, we just decided to take a chance.' 

Seven years later, the couple are married with two children of their own, along with two children from Rachel's previous marriage and five children from Mike's earlier relationship.

Mike has taken on the role of house husband, while Rachel is studying for a degree in nursing. 

He said: 'It's great, I'm a house husband and I do school runs, get up in the night with the kids, sort out meals and do most of all that side of things because I have more time.

'It's a bit like being a full-time dad, but also with the role you'd expect the wife to have.'

Mike and Rachel first met int heir local church, where he was a volunteer pastor and she was the organist 

And his elder children are equally comfortable with the age gap in his second marriage. 

When asked what his family first made of the match, he said: 'One of my lads asked if she has a friend!' 

The only negative of their budding romance was that Rachel and Mike were both forced to leave their local church after a backlash from fellow members of the congregation. 

Rachel said: 'Initially it was very difficult, but looking back I can understand why they did what they did. 

'Because I was still legally married, they saw it as adultery, even though I had left my first husband before anything happened with Mike. 

'But I can see why they did what they did. I don't hold any hard feelings.'  

Mike added: 'The problem was also that her ex-husband obviously needed some support and if had we stayed in that congregation, then he wouldn't have got the support that he needed, so we found another one.' 

Rachel fell for Mike because of his chivalrous behaviour 

But now the dust has long settled and the couple are looking forward to sharing the rest of their lives together.  

And both Rachel and Mike believe that the age difference gives them just as good chance of survival as a couple who are the same age. 

Mike said: 'With marriages today, you see the ones who break up - they're often the same age.

'So it must be compatibility, not age and about whether you can keep the love going.'

Mike and Rachel Kelly star in a documentary called Age Gap Love on Channel 5 at 9pm tonight.
