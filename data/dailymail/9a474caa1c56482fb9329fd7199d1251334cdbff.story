A middle school teacher has been arrested after allegedly seducing a 15-year-old student over Twitter and taking her virginity in his office at a school outside Philadelphia.

William A. Barber, 38, had sex with the student while his wife was pregnant with the couple's fourth child, detectives say. Barber has been a Garnet Valley Middle School teacher for the last 12 years.

In the past few weeks, the well-liked physical education teacher and his wife have been in the spotlight for creating the viral 'lemon shot challenge' to raise funds to help their four-year-old daughter who suffers from pediatric cancer.

Barber promoted the challenge on local TV stations and through his Twitter account -- but police say that's not all Barber used his Twitter account for.

Sexting: Authorities say that Barber and the teen communicated through text message and Twitter 

Authorities say that the 15-year-old, who had been in Barber's physical education class when she was in eighth grade, communicated with Barber through text message and social media and that Barber 'lured' her via Twitter.

Some Twitter messages to the teen read: 'Wow you are a very sexy young lady,' 'You could have been here but it’s all good. I shouldn't temp (sic) myself anyway,' and 'But your body makes me crazy. Ugh...'

Garnet Valley students alerted staff of an 'inappropriate relationship' between Barber and a student on Monday, according to a letter  to parents from Garnet Valley School District Superintendent Marc Bertrando.

Barber allegedly sexually assaulted the female student  on September 12 in his middle school office.

The Delaware County Daily Times reports that the two met in Barber's office at approximately 3.30pm and began kissing. They then moved to a back room of the office where they had sexual intercourse.

The Times also reports that, in an affidavit, the teen said the intercourse did not last a long period of time due to the pain of it being her 'first time.'  

The teen stated in the affidavit that she sent Barber nude photographs of herself, according to the Times.

Trooper Mark Gibble spoke to Barber and the Times reports that Barber admitted to being with the teen in his office and being fully aware that she was 15. Barber also admitted to kissing the teen and receiving nude photographs from her.

An investigation launched Monday led to Barber's arrest by Pennsylvania State Police with charges including statutory sexual assault, institutional sexual assault, unlawful contact with a minor, corruption of a minor and indecent assault.

Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan told the Times Tuesday night that Barber is facing 'substantial incarceration' and though sexual assault cases generally involve more than one victim, no current evidence suggests that is the case.

At a preliminary arraignment held Tuesday, Barber's attorney Elizabeth McDonald reportedly cited Barber's lack of a criminal history, his lifelong Delaware County residency, and his being married with three children.

McDonald asked Magisterial District Judge Walter Strohl to give Barber unsecured bail -- the request was denied. 

Barber is on paid administrative leave from the school district, according to MyFox Philly.

Barber was hired by the school district in 2002 and had become a familiar and beloved face in the neighborhood.  

In his letter, school superintendent Bertrando reportedly said that he understands that Barber's allegations will leave members of the close-knit community 'feeling betrayed.'

'The safety, welfare, and health of our students and staff is our utmost concern,' Bertrando stated in his letter, 'and we are acutely aware of how difficult this situation will be for our entire community.'

He assured parents that the 12-year Garnet Valley teacher had passed all child abuse and criminal history clearances when he was hired.

Barber is married with three children. His wife is due to have their fourth child in a few weeks

Barber's allegations have left many parents and community members in shock, however, some parents are standing behind the well-liked teacher.

In an interview with MyFox Philly, parent Lisa McCusker said Barber was 'phenomenal.'

'Without him as a teacher my daughter would not have thrived. She has special needs. He's an amazing guy,' McCusker said.

Not all of the parents share McCusker's view.

Parent Fran Griffith  that Barber's allegations are disgusting and that she 'feels sorry for his wife.'

In a MyFox interview, Bertrando said that the district will be involved in supporting its students and will 'let the legal process take its course.'
