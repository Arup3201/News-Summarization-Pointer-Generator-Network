Manipulative: Ariel Castro would reportedly test the kidnapped women to see if they would run when they thought he had left, and then beat them if they did

Local police sources have revealed that suspected kidnapper Ariel Castro would use a sick game to 'train' the three girls not to run away by pretending to leave the house, only to beat them if they tried to run free.

This is said to be just one of the manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house for up to ten years, in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging from the ceiling.

Ariel Castro, the 52-year-old man who lived in the west Cleveland house, was the first of three brothers to be arrested in connection to the case of the three kidnapped young women- Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight- who were rescued on Monday.

Reporters from local station WOIO spoke to law enforcement sources who said that he would 'play this little dangerous game that he would tell the women he was about to leave the home, and then he would wait and if one of them tried to open that door, he would go in and attack them.'

'That was one of the ways he was able to keep them there,' reporter Dan Deroos told CNN's Anderson Cooper.

The trick clearly contributed to the young womens' captivity, as Berry stressed the fact that she feared his quick return during her frantic 911 call.

The hanging chains were also reportedly used during the first few years of captivity, along with frequent beatings.

'They were bound and gagged several times throughout the course of being held in that home,' WOIO reports.

Another psychological tactic that he used to keep the women in constant fear was the constant threat of violence, and threats to their childrens' lives.

While Berry is said to have birthed her six-year-old daughter Jocelyn during her captivity, police are reportedly looking for the bodies of other children who were miscarried or died due to malnutrition.

'Numerous times throughout this 10-year period, that some of the women became pregnant and that they would be beaten, forcibly hit in the stomach to force a miscarriage, if you can imagine that,' WOIO reporter Deroos told CNN.

Jocelyn, like her mother, was said to be dehydrated and malnourished, but eventually given the all-clear by a local hospital following their rescue.

Other children are thought to have suffered a different fate, as cadaver dogs were brought to the house by investigators searching for the bodies of any other children.

The ongoing investigation of the house has led investigators to believe that while the girls were kept on the property by the boarded windows, padlocked doors, and chicken wire-laden fence, they may have been able to access multiple rooms inside the home.

Neighbors of Ariel Castro said that when police raided the three-storey property, they went straight upstairs and hauled the girls out.

At the top of the property at the back is a smashed window - thought to be the attic - which could have been broken in an attempt to attract attention to themselves or wriggle out to freedom.

It now appears the girls were not just held in the basement as had previously been thought, but could have had their own room in the four-bedroom house. Newsnet5 reported they could even have been untied at different times rather than being on constant lockdown.

MailOnline can also reveal that Ariel Castro, who owned the house and has been arrested along with his two brothers, turned it into a 'fortress' by setting up a stockade round the back.

He used chicken wire and blue tarpaulin to make an eight-foot high fence and let the trees and bushes go overgrown so nobody could see in.

The house is now the center of an FBI investigation after Berry, 27, DeJesus, 23 and Knight, 30, were all found there after being missing for around ten years.

Neighbors said that Ariel Castro used to be seen very often at the property but in recent years had only been there a few times a week, to the extent that it was thought the property was vacant and that he was using it as an investment.

Meanwhile, Cleveland police allege, the three girls remained trapped inside, meaning they could have had to wait for days at a time to eat.

The back windows of the house are either boarded up or have the curtains drawn and even the large garage style building in the back garden has its windows covered.

Israel Lugo, 39, who lives three 
houses down from Ariel Castro's home, said that he was just arriving 
home yesterday when neighbor Charles Ramsay heard the cries from Amanda 
Berry.

He said: 'Amanda
 Berry was at the front door banging on it and screaming so Chuck 
(Charles) pulled it open from the bottom, there was a bit sticking out.

'He
 was about to go back in for the other two when the police arrived and 
went straight upstairs. She told them that's where the girls were.

'Inside the house there is a staircase up when you go in, and behind it there is one going down.

'On the second floor there are four bedrooms, and then there's the attic at the top.

'The other two girls came right out. Amanda had a kid with her. From what I gather they were being held in separate rooms, not just the basement.'

Mr Lugo said that Ariel Castro was 'hiding in plain sight' all these years and that only last Sunday he was in the park with the same child, a girl of six.

He said: 'Ariel was acting all happy families, like it was his own daughter. They played with my son's girl and he bought her a pastry at the bakery.

'It was like they were a family. I can't believe it'.
