A 33-year-old woman danced for the first time Wednesday night since losing her left leg in the Boston Marathon bombings.

Adrianne Haslet-Davis, who taught 20 different types of dance at the Arthur Murray studio in Boston, performed a short rumba on stage at the TED conference in Vancouver, BC thanks to a one-of-a-kind prosthetic.

The dance instructor lost part of her left leg when she and husband Adam Davis, a captain in the Air Force, decided to spend April 15, 2013 watching the marathon. She and her husband were two of more than 250 runners and spectators injured in the blasts. Three died from their injuries.

While recovering from her injuries at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, Haslet-Davis met Hugh Herr, director of the Biomechatronics group at the MIT Media lab who thought he might be able to help her dance again.Â 

Herr, a double amputee himself from a rock climbing accident in 1982, built the bombings survivor the first prosthetic leg specifically designed for dance.

At the conference on Wednesday, Haslet-Davis debuted the leg with a routine to Enrique Iglesias' 'Ring My Bells', performing with dance partner Christian Lightner.

'I'm thrilled to have danced again,' Haslet-Davis said after her routine. 'It was invigorating to dance publicly with my new leg, but also to realize that my return to dance may have the power to inspire other people to reach for their goals and be proactive in their lives.'

'My first dance happening to be so near the anniversary of the marathon bombing stands as a reminder that I'm a survivor, not a victim,' she added.

In her statement, Haslet-Davis thanked Herr for the prosthetic gift that made it possible for her to dance again.

Herr also appeared at the conference to talk about the new prosthetic and his other work.

'We're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and more efficient,' he said.

For Haslet-Davis, the new prosthetic opens up the opportunity for her to appear on Dancing with the Stars again.

She made a guest appearance on the show last May, but hopes to dance on the show in the future.
