David Beckham came under fire from anti- gambling campaigners last night after revealing he has signed up with a Las Vegas hotel and casino giant to help promote its property businesses in Asia.

The former England football captain will promote properties owned by Las Vegas Sands in Singapore and the Chinese gambling enclave of Macau.

He has already made promotional appearances with groups of local schoolchildren at casino resorts.

Sands admits it hopes to cash in on the popularity in the region of 
the 38-year-old who quit as a player in May with a fortune estimated at 
£165million. His wife Victoria is said to have another £35million.

Last
 night Beckham’s spokesman said ‘the central part (of the deal) is a 
dining and sports experience along with corporate social responsibility 
initiatives. There is explicitly no promotion around gambling.’

But
 his partnership with the casino company has disturbed counsellors 
helping to combat the perils of gambling addiction. They warn that his 
association with such a well-known gambling company and his position as a
 role model could raise awareness of gambling with people who wouldn’t 
otherwise be interested.

‘This is very bad news,’ said Peter Chan,
 manager of the London-based Christian Centre for Gambling 
Rehabilitation. ‘David Beckham could influence a lot of people and he 
should be very careful who he associates himself with. We can’t look 
lightly on it.

‘He probably doesn’t know about the kinds of 
problems that gambling can bring. He should take the time and learn 
about the kind of devastation that gambling can cause to people and 
their families and friends. The point is that the gambling industry is 
using him.’

GamCare, Britain’s leading charity providing support 
and advice for people suffering with gambling problems, said young 
people can be influenced by role models.

‘For most people gambling
 is a popular leisure activity, but for some it can spiral out of 
control with potentially harmful consequences,’ GamCare said.

‘Celebrities
 may have an influence on their fan base in terms of the companies they 
associate themselves with, and we have concerns that young people in 
particular may not be aware of the risks associated with gambling.’

Sands owns four booming casinos in Macau. The Venetian Macau is the largest casino in the world.

Over
 the summer, Beckham met about 60 children at a Sands casino resort in 
Singapore. Last month he posed for photographs with 100 local children 
at the Venetian Macau Resort.

The children were selected with the help of local groups, including the Association of Rehabilitation of Drug Abusers of Macau.

Under
 the deal with Sands Beckham will get involved in more charitable 
activities in Asia, including events organised by the Marina Bay Sands 
in Singapore and the China Sands.

He previously co-operated with 
the Marina Bay Sands for its annual festival raising funds for the 
Singapore Association for the Deaf and Art Outreach Singapore, according
 to the Jakarta Post.

Details about what the partnership will look
 like over the long term are scarce and Beckham has not disclosed the 
financial terms. Sands said it will use the Beckham name in dining and 
retail options at its casino resorts.

Michael Leven, the company’s
 president and chief operating officer, said the Beckham brand will help
 Sands ‘as we aggressively explore opportunities to further expand our 
presence in Asia’.

Beckham’s own charity, the Victoria and David 
Beckham Charitable Trust, provides wheelchairs to children in need and 
he works as a UNICEF ambassador to help raise AIDS awareness.

He 
is a founder member of the Malaria No More UK Leadership Council and a 
prominent supporter of the Help for Heroes charity which helps 
servicemen and women injured in Iraq and Afghanistan.
