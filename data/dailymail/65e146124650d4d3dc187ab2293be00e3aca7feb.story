This police department in New York is keeping the Christmas spirit alive.

After a burglar stole a White Plains family's Christmas presents from under the tree, police there stepped it up and played Santa.

White Plains police presented the Cuenca-Orzuna family Saturday with $1,500 worth of gift cards and several toys.

Officers raised the money, with contributions from their union and police officials, after the family's apartment was ransacked last week.

The White Plains home of the Cuenca-Orzuna family (pictured) was recently broken into, and all the children's toys were stolen from right under the tree. Luckily, local cops were there to help

'We had to do something,' Detective German Lopez told The Journal-News. 'We couldn't let these kids go without a Christmas.'

Lopez says the thief or thieves took the gifts awaiting the family's four children, plus presents for several cousins.

'I was very angry about this,' he told the Journal-News. 'I have kids and grandchildren myself, so I can imagine what the Orzunas must have felt when their kids' presents were stolen.'

Even the children's piggy banks were gone.

'I found a lot of kids crying,' said Lopez, a 23-year police veteran who responded to the call about the burglary, to the Journal-News.

It happened while dad Rogelio Orzuna was at his job as a cook, and mom Maria Cuenca was running errands.

'The door was pried open, all the lights were on and our clothes were thrown all over the floor,' mother-of-four Cuenca told the Journal-News.

'Then I saw that all of the presents were gone, and my heart just broke.'

Cops from the White Plains PD donated $1,500 in cash and toys to help put this family's Christmas back together

Lopez says officers felt they 'couldn't let these kids go without a Christmas.'

Cuenca says the children couldn't be more excited. 

'I couldn't believe it when Detective Lopez told me what the police were doing for us,' the mom told the Journal-News.

'Now we can get all the presents back and Christmas isn't ruined. We're very thankful.'
