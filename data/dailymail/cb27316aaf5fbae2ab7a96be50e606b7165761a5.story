Micah Richards has joined Fiorentina on a season-long loan deal after West Ham turned their back on the pursuit of the Manchester City and former England defender.

Richards, 26, signed for the Serie A club after his wages of around £75,000-a-week proved too big a stumbling block for the Hammers.

City have also secured a £1million loan fee after West Ham withdrew their interest. While the transfer to Fiorentina is only temporary, there is a view to a permanent move.

City captain Vincent Kompany tweeted Micah Richards to wish him luck in Serie A, posting: '#MCFC club legend! Proud to have played 6 years alongside this man. Congratulations and good luck at @ACF_Fiorentina my brother #forzaMicah.' 

Fiorentina are also interested in Richards' team-mate John Guidetti, but could face competition from Palermo. 

The 21-year-old Sweden striker was linked with Olympiacos last week. City fans might be a little concerned at the possibility of Guidetti following Alvaro Negredo out of the door, leaving them short of strikers. 

Richards, meanwhile, is out of contention at the Etihad and made only two Premier League appearances last season, including the 3-1 win at Upton Park.

In total, he played only 10 games last season – including five domestic cup ties. He has played 13 times for England but injuries and a loss of form have seen him drop down the pecking order.

Sources at West Ham were surprised he wasn’t prepared to take a huge drop in wages for first team football. 

Target: West Ham were interested in Richards but have been put off by his wage demands an a £1m loan fee

When Richards swaps northern England for the north of Italy, he might encounter a few differences.
