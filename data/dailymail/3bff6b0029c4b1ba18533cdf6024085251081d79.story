David Reid, 50, has been jailed for six years after admitting conning friends and vulnerable people out of £3.5million

A 'cold-hearted' conman who lived the high-life on cash taken from vulnerable investors in a £3.5million fraud has been jailed.

David Reid splashed out on fast cars, a boat, spent thousands on restaurants and hotels, took foreign ski holidays and funded his shooting hobby using money from friends who trusted him with their savings.

Newcastle Crown Court heard that, in one case, a little boy with special needs lost out on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Disney Land when he family were conned.

In total Reid, who posed as a solicitor and former Olympic shooter, conned 50 victims who lost their homes, life savings, and pensions through the Washington Mortgage Company.

Judge James Goss QC yesterday sentenced the 50-year-old, who claimed to be a Labour party member, to six years behind bars. The judge told him: 'This involves over £3.5million which was spent on good living.

'Many offences were committed against older and entirely trusting, decent people, some of whom in vulnerable situations by reason of ill health or other circumstances including bereavement.

'They were cruelly deceived by your false veneer of professionalism and reassurances. They have suffered financially, some ruinously, and emotionally. 'Personal statements reveal the devastating consequences for them and their families of your gross breaches of trust.'

Reid was described by one of his victims as a 'very clever and affable' man who wore Saville Row suits and would impress potential investors with £10,000 parties at his home, where fairground rides and clay pigeon shooting would be put on for the guests. Prosecutor David Dixon told the court: 'He was a plausible conman for a period in excess of 10 years, obtaining funds from people who knew him, were referred to him and who had been to his business premises in the Galleries.

'He set up a carefully crafted, professionally operated fraud.'

The court heard Reid used forged documents to convince his clients their money was invested safely in offs-shore accounts through the Abbey National and later Santander.

When his scam was uncovered by a client he duped in 2003 the police were informed yet no prosecution followed and he continued to trade.

Reid hosted £10,000 parties at his house for investors with fairground rides and clay pigeon shooting to make them feel secure, while actually spending their cash on cars, a boat, luxury hotels and fine dining

The court heard many of his victims had considered themselves friends of the fraudster and found they had lost everything through listening to his advice.

Mr Dixon added: 'The crown say it was particularly cold-hearted, he was callous in the way he offended.

'It was a clear case of greed. He spent £1,000 on dog bills, £11,500 on skiing holidays, £14, 000 on restaurants and hotels, £6,000 on shooting and £55,000 to pay off credit cards.

'Over the years he has had the benefit of nice cars including Mercedes Benz, a Range Rover, Audi and at one stage had a boat.

'It is difficult to say where all the money has gone. Very little, if any, will remain.'

The court heard one widower lost £300,000 his late wife had left as an inheritance for her family's future.

Trevor Lazaro, 50, from County Durham, turned to Reid, who he had thought was a friend, to help with financial affairs when his wife Linda lost her battle with cancer.

Widower Lazaro, of Burnhope, County Durham, described how Reid groomed his family for several years, knowing that his wife Linda has cancer - and that she had a large insurance policy of £300,000.

As a result of taking the conman's advice Mr Lazario, who has a child with downs syndrome, has been forced to put the family home on the market.

He said: 'The defendant has stolen my family money, stolen my future and my children's futures, as well as make a fool out of me and our friendship.

'Most of the money was left for the long-term care of my eldest daughter, who has Down's syndrome. That is gone now.

'He never had the common decency to come and apologise. He appears to show no remorse whatsoever for his actions.

Newcastle Crown Court heard that Reid's 50 victims lost their homes, life savings and pensions and in one case a boy with down's syndrome missed out on a once-of-a-lifetime trip to Disney Land when his parents were duped

'He is nothing more than a common thief, preying on the sick and the vulnerable.'Another victim who said Reid had given a eulogy at her late husband's funeral and helped her sort out financial necessities while she was grieving.

She later realised he had conned her out of more than £30,000. The woman, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I couldn't believe what I was hearing, it was like a nightmare I couldn't wake up from.

'I felt totally lost, like a bereavement all over again. My husband went to his grave thinking I was financially set for the rest of my life.

'I have no trust left in anyone anymore.'

The court heard Reid confessed during police interviews there were more than 50 victims.

Some payments were made from the accounts but a total loss of more than £1.6million remains outstanding and is unlikely to be recovered.

Jamie Adams, defending, said Reid is 'sorry' for what he did and had not set out deliberately to make people lose money.

Mr Adams said Reid has tried to kill himself twice and feels real shame and remorse for what he has done.

He added: 'He was not setting out for people to lose money, that was not the objective here.

'He became over-confident and thought he could play the system. He was playing the markets because he had large sums of money available to him.

Reid, from Burnhope, County Durham, pleaded guilty to 22 charges of 
obtaining a money transfer by deception and one of participating in a 
fraudulent business.
