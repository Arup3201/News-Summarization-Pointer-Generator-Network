A heartbroken mother was grieving today after her six-week-old baby was apparently murdered.

Donna Sullock, 29, is being comforted by relatives after the death of her ‘beautiful’ son Alfie, who was allegedly attacked in Nelson, Caerphilly, while staying away from his home in Fairwater, Cardiff.

After reports to police of a child not breathing on Friday, Alfie was taken to Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil and later transferred to Cardiff’s University Hospital of Wales, but died yesterday.

Prior to the boy’s death, Michael Pearce, 32, of Nelson, was arrested and charged with assault. He appeared before Caerphilly Magistrates’ Court on Monday and was remanded in custody.

He will appear at Newport Crown Court in South Wales on Thursday of next week. Gwent Police have now launched a murder enquiry following the boy's death.

Friends and family have posted messages of support online for Ms Sullock, who had said before Alfie’s death how ‘words can’t describe how happy’ she was to be a mother.

Her cousin Joanna Regan said: ‘Thinking of my beautiful family at this sad time. No words can describe the loss we have been through and no one will ever understand the reasons why.’

Ms Sullock described herself on Facebook as a ‘full time mummy,’ whose job was ‘looking after my beautiful son Alfie’. She would dress her son in dungarees and Vans trainers.

The baby had been staying 15 miles away in Nelson when police received a report to say he wasn’t breathing.

His great aunt Jaci Ledley said: ‘Been to say my last goodbyes to a very special little prince. Love you loads. May the angels be with you.’

And the boy’s aunt Stacey Pope added: ‘Poor baby boy - I’m glad I met you and held you.’

A Gwent Police spokesman said: ‘We received a call to an address in Nelson at 9.15pm on August 16 reporting a baby not breathing.

‘The six-week-old baby boy from the Cardiff area was taken to the Prince Charles Hospital and transferred to the Heath hospital where he subsequently died.

‘A 32-year-old man from the Nelson area was arrested and charged with assault. He has appeared at Caerphilly Magistrates’ Court.’
