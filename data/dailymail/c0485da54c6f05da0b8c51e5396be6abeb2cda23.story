So dramatic has Liverpool's slide down the table been in 2014-15 that even if they won every single match until the end of the Premier League campaign they would still not reach last season's tally of 84 points.

Brendan Rodgers' side impressed fans across the country with their swashbuckling style last season and finished second only to Manchester City, scoring 101 goals in the process.

But the current campaign has seen a significant drop in form, with the Reds having won just nine matches and accumulated a mere 32 points from their 21 matches this season - leaving Rodgers' team a lowly eighth in the Premier League.

Liverpool have endured a difficult 2014-15 campaign - including a 3-0 loss at Manchester United

Even if the Reds win all their remaining 17 matches, they cannot reach last season's points total of 84 - reached while Luis Suarez (left) and Daniel Sturridge were banging in goals for fun

All this means that, by the middle of January and with 17 games still remaining, Liverpool cannot reach the 84-point mark they achieved in the last campaign.

In the unlikely event the Reds won every single one of those 17 matches, they would only reach 83 points.

Nevertheless, Liverpool will be determined to accumulate as many wins as they can between now and the end of the season - starting with Aston Villa on Saturday.

The Reds head to Villa Park to take on a side who have scored just 11 league goals all season.

But despite that, Rodgers' record against the Villa boss is hardly inspiring - he has won just twice in seven meetings with Paul Lambert, with the Scot claiming victory on four occasions (plus one draw).

However, Rodgers' two victories against Lambert have come at Villa Park on the two most-recent occasions Liverpool have visited Birmingham - with a 2-1 win in March 2013 followed up by a 1-0 triumph in August the same year.

And Liverpool will also be looking for revenge following the 1-0 reversal they suffered against Villa at Anfield in September, when Gabriel Agbonlahor netted the only goal to send Lambert's men home with all three points.
