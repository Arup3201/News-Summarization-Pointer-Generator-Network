Jane Jackson has been struck off after she was caught half naked with an inmate in locked room

A nurse who romped half naked with an inmate at a maximum security jail was struck off today.

Jane Jackson was caught topless in a private treatment room with a male prisoner at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, Bucks.

The category A prison, once dubbed 'Britain's Alcatraz', houses some of the country's most dangerous criminals including rapists, murderers and terrorists.

Jackson jammed a mop under the door of the treatment room and stripped off in front of the inmate, referred to as Prisoner A.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council panel had ruled the blonde nurse had an inappropriate and sexually motivated relationship with the man.

Jackson's fitness to practice was found to be impaired by reason of misconduct and she was struck off.

Paul Morris, chairing the hearing, said: 'It is clear Miss Jackson has not provided a high standard of practice at all times, acted with integrity or upheld the reputation of the profession.

'She failed to establish and maintain professional boundaries with prisoner A and she was in breach of her obligations which amounted to serious professional misconduct.

'Her flagrant disregard of policy seriously undermines the risk of security, not only to herself and colleagues but the security of the entire prison.

'Her misconduct carried an unwarranted risk of arm and bought the profession into disrepute.'

Jackson was caught out on February 7, 2009, when prison guard Rebecca Langley burst into the treatment room during her tryst with Prisoner A.

'Her top half was naked, and she was holding her bra and staff tunic in her hand,' said Barry Dooley, for the NMC.

'As the registrant dressed, Ms Langley asked how she had locked the door, and the registrant replied that this is how we always do it, by wedging the mop against the door.'

A sobbing Jackson was taken straight to the prison governor's office and suspended before being frogmarched off the premises.

She admitted breaking strict regulations by being alone with Prisoner A and taking off her clothes.

But she claimed it was a one-off, and said she had been pressured into it by the inmate, fearing for her life.

'He said 'let me into the treatment room' he had this horrible look on his face'.

'I just froze and panicked, then opened the door.'

'She added that she opened the door "like a robot", adding that Prisoner A "had the remote control, thats how I felt"'

HMP Woodhill is one of the country's maximum security prisons, housing inmates that have committed the most serious crimes

But Mr Dooley told the hearing: 'If she was so scared and feared for her life, why would she open a locked door and go in with him simply on the basis of a look?

'She did not call out for help at any stage although she knew there were police officers nearby, she even admitted she had put the mop across the door for privacy.'

Jackson had previously said 'I had strong feelings for him, I knew deep down that I was a professional and he was a prisoner.'

She threw her keys to the prison doors on a chair during her romp with the prisoner, putting the security of the jail at risk, the hearing was told.

'Being in a confined space with a prisoner means that you have potentially put at risk the security of the establishment', said Hannah Pugliesie, a senior manager with Milton Keynes Primary Care Trust which provides medical care at the jail.

'You could be held hostage, you could be at risk in that particular environment.'

Jackson had already confessed to breaching strict security by smuggling Lynx deodorant and Radox shower gel into the jail for the prisoner in January 2009.

'Very stupidly I brought toiletries in just to shut him up,' Jackson said. 'It was absolutely wrong but I did it.'

The contraband items were found in his cell following Jackson's suspension, adding weight to the NMC's case that Jackson was in a relationship with Prisoner A.

He worked in the prison laundry along the corridor from Jackson's office, and would regularly chat to the nurse on his way back to the cells.

She also denied two drugs cabinets in her treatment room were open during her tryst with prisoner A, a claim that was rejected by the panel.Â 

Jackson was fired by the health trust on July 9, 2009, following an internal investigation.
