Supporters staged a mass walkout in the middle of Blackpool’s game against Cardiff on Friday night in a protest against the ownership of their club.

Hundreds of fans chose to leave Bloomfield Road in the 53rd minute - the year in which the Seasiders won the FA Cup - to make it patently clear to the Oyston family that they do not have their support.

There has long-running feud between the Oystons - comprising of 80-year-old owner Owen and his son, chairman Karl - and the fans.

The latter argue the heirarchy have a total disregard for their customers and have taken money earned via winning promotion to the Premier League for their own means.

The Bloomfield Road faithful also came together to flash the camera lights on the back of their mobile phones midway through the first half as well as releasing a number of black balloons.

Blackpool actually took the lead shortly after the protest from their fans as former Stevenage striker Francois Zoko put the home side ahead in the 64th minute.
