Seven-year-old Malachi Tyler who suffers from an incurable brain tumour has always dreamed of becoming a police officer.

And now his wish has come true after the youngster was invited to join 200 recruits at a Metropolitan Police passing out parade and was even given his own handmade uniform.

Malachi, from Tunbridge Wells in Kent, is blind and suffers from the genetic condition neurofibromatosis, which causes tumours to grow on his nerves.

Malachi was asked to join the new recruits for the parade after always dreaming of becoming a policeman and was given his own special uniform for the occasion 

He lost his eyesight shortly before his second birthday, but his parents Emma, 42 and Graham, 51, were hopeful it might return.

But when they learned he was unlikely to see again, Mrs Tyler said her son was devastated he wouldn't be able to fulfil his dream of becoming a policeman.

She explained: 'He's always wanted to be a policeman but when he realised he wasn't going to get his sight back he got very upset that he wouldn't fulfil his dream.

'He said "but mum, I won't be able to arrest anybody, they will be able to get away from me".

'When his tumour started to grow again in July we decided to give him something to look forward to and draw up a bucket list.

'Some of the things were quite funny like meet a New Zealander because he likes their accent and one was that he wanted to arrest somebody.'

During the ceremomy, Kingston Borough Commander Glenn Tunstall told the recruits that Malachi was the bravest new officer there

A friend, who is a police officer, was then able to arrange a visit to Kingston Police Station in Surrey and organised for Malachi to 'arrest' Chief Inspector Gary Taylor and 'pepper spray' staff - albeit using water.

He was then invited to the police inauguration last December but was admitted to hospital for three emergency brain operations and missed it.

But luckily he recovered to attend a parade last week at Hendon Police College in Barnet, north west London.

He was asked to join in with the new officers by donning his own special uniform made especially for him and then got the opportunity to help drive a police car.

During the ceremony, Kingston Borough Commander Glenn Tunstall told the recruits: 'It is a real honour for me to introduce the youngest of our recruits on parade today.

'To his family he is Malachi Tyler but to us he is PC 999VK Tyler of Kingston Police Station.

'Although he is amongst good company - I would argue that Malachi is one of the bravest people here today.

Malachi, pictured with another officer, first received chemotherapy when he was just 12 months old for this condition 

'At the age of one Malachi was diagnosed as having a brain tumour, and a month before his second birthday, he lost full use of his sight.

'His positivity, his cheekiness, the constant giggles and ultimately his courage in the face of adversity humbled us all.

'In the Met one of our values is courage - which is epitomised by this little boy and his family.'

Mrs Tyler added: 'It was mega emotional for me, I definitely shed a few tears but Malachi loved it.

'Uniform Services made him the little outfit - it must be the smallest one they ever made. He looked lovely in it.

'He was also allowed to drive a police car. One of the instructors used Malachi's white cane to do the pedals while he drove.

'They even got the helicopter to fly over and do a bow to him.

'All the new recruits did a whip round and raised £750 for Malachi's trust.'

Malachi's tumour is inoperable but his parents hope they can prevent it growing any more.

Chemotherapy, which he first received when he was just 12 months old, may eventually halt the growth of the tumours that took his eyesight.
