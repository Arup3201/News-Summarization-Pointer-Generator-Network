Jen Palmer (pictured) and her husband John have threatened to a lawsuit against Kleargear.com after it  fined them $3,500 for posting a negative review

A Texas couple has allegedly been threatened with a $3,500 charge or credit blacklisting by a company who they wrote a bad review about online.

Jen Palmer claims her husband ordered 'trinkets' from Kleargear.com in 2009, but PayPal cancelled the transaction when the goods weren't delivered within 30 days.

Palmer told KUTV she tried unsuccessfully to contact the company before venting online.

The young mom wrote a negative review on Ripoffreport.com, slamming the online retailer's 'incompetent customer service' and 'refusal to ship products to San Antonio, Texas.'

But that wasn't the end of it, according to an investigation by KUTV.

Three years later, Palmer's 
husband got an email from Kleargear.com demanding the post be removed or
 the couple would be fined.

The company claimed Palmer had violated a 
'non-disparagement clause' buried in the sale terms and conditions.

'In an effort to ensure fair and 
honest public feedback, and to prevent the publishing of libelous 
content in any form, your acceptance of this sales contract prohibits 
you from taking any action that negatively impacts kleargear.com, its 
reputation, products, services, management or employees,' the clause stated.

The
 clause also said if a consumer violates the contract, they will 
have 72 hours to remove the post or face a $3500 fine.

If that fine is 
not paid, the delinquency will be reported to consumer credit reporting agencies.

'This is fraud,' Palmer said. 'They're blackmailing us for telling the truth.'

Kleargear.com appears to have removed the clause from its terms of sale within the last couple months. It appeared on the website as recently as August 2013.

Jen Palmer contacted RipoffReport.com to remove the post, which would allegedly cost $2,000.

When she didn't pay Kleargear.com the 'fine' within 30 days, the company contacted credit bureaus, which dinged her credit score.Â 

She said the family has been rejected by numerous lenders.

'I have the right to tell somebody else these guys ripped me off,' Palmer said.

KUTV said the company defended its policy, saying the clause was a 'term of sale'.

The company also said requiring Palmer to remove the 
post or face a fine was a 'diligent effort to help them avoid [the fine]'.

Palmer is not the first person to complain about the retailer, with dozens of similar criticisms on Ripoffreport.com.

Moreover, the Better Business Bureau slapped the company with an 'F rating' in 2010 for 'not delivering products purchased online in a timely manner'. Kleargear.com today has a 'B rating'.

Jen Palmer claims she and her husband have been rejected by several lenders because Kleangear.com reported her 'delinquency' to credit companies

Salt Lake City First Amendment attorney, Jeff Hunt a judge would likely consider a non-disparagement clause unconstitutional.

'I
 think this is outrageous that a company like this would force a 
consumer to relinquish their first amendment rights to speak about their
 product as a condition of sale,' Hunt told KUTV.

'I have a serious question about whether a court would enforce that kind of covenant because it's massively over broad and against public policy.'
