Ellie Simmonds missed out on an historic golden hat-trick, coming second in the 100m freestyle

As the poster girl for the Paralympics, the hopes of Britain were once again heaped on her small shoulders.

But yesterday – on the final full day of competition – swimmer Ellie Simmonds just missed out on an historic golden hat-trick after she was beaten into second place by long-time rival Victoria Arlen in the 100m freestyle.

It was a fitting climax for the most successful Paralympics ever – the struggle for supremacy between the 17-year-olds has ignited the public's interest in disabled sport.

Arlen took an early lead in 
yesterday's race before storming down the final length to win in a 
world-record time. Afterwards the great rivals embraced over the lane 
ropes.

Simmonds said: 'I 
gave it everything on the last 50m but I just didn't have anything left.
I am really happy – I would have loved to get the gold, but you can't 
have everything.'

Arlen 
said: 'I don't even know how to react, I was in shock. When you look up 
at the results, there is no feeling to describe it.'

The drama of their rivalry has spanned the 11-day duration of the Paralympics.

Two days before the Opening Ceremony, 
Arlen was left distraught after being kicked out of the Games for not 
being impaired enough by her disability. However, she was reinstated on 
appeal just in time to allow her to do battle with Simmonds for the 
first time in the 400m freestyle last Saturday.

Then, the British heroine seized the lead in the final few metres to win the 'race of the Games', leaving the feisty American 'growling with anger'. But Arlen yesterday extracted sweet revenge by defeating Simmonds to take gold in the 100m freestyle.

Ever since Simmonds's first golden performance, television figures for the Paralympics have gone through the roof. Her victory last Saturday was watched by 2.9 million viewers. Five days later 5.5 million saw track star David Weir take home his 800m title, and 6.7 million tuned in to see Jonnie Peacock defeat 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius in the 100m.

There have also been sellout crowds. A record 2.7million people attended the Games, surpassing attendances at the Beijing Paralympics by 900,000. The Games have raised £45 million as corporate sponsors have rushed to take advantage of the enormous exposure the Paralympics has provided.

British success has also helped. As of yesterday, ParalympicGB was ranked third in the medals table with 115 in total, including 32 golds, surpassing the team's haul from Beijing four years ago.

Yesterday's medallists included  cyclist David Stone, who successfully defended his title in the road race at Brands Hatch.

The 31-year-old, who has cerebral palsy, took part in the 2000 Paralympics before giving up the sport for several years to travel to India. He resumed his career in time to win two gold medals in 2008.

David Smith won silver in the boccia and there was a bronze for Harriet Lee in the 100m breaststroke.

Tim Hollingsworth, chief executive of the British Paralympic Association, said the Paralympics must 'build on the momentum' the London Games has created.

He added: 'I defy anyone to say that some of the remarkable victories we have seen at these Games have not been among some of the greatest moments in British sport.'

Nobody has quite captured the public's affection as much as the 4ft 1in Simmonds, from Walsall, who also won the 200m individual medley.

Ellie, who has a form of short-limbed dwarfism, was already the subject of adulation after winning two golds in Beijing as an irrepressible 13-year-old but the courage of her performances at these Games took it to a different level.

Her father Steve Simmonds said last night: 'She delivers on the right stage and there's no bigger stage than this. She's done herself, us and her country proud.

'Just because she didn't win tonight doesn't mean she hasn't given every ounce of what she's got.'

He added his daughter sent him a text message about her experience at the Games. He said: 'The last thing she said was, “I don't want it to end.” She loves it, she loves the whole atmosphere, she loves being in there, she loves being with the team, she loves being in the village.'

Simmonds has helped changed attitudes towards disability, he added.

'People like Oscar Pistorius, David Weir and Ellie have created a culture with the Paralympics,' he said.

'People come to watch high performance, honed, trained athletes perform to the best of their ability. Years ago they came to the freak show. It's what Ellie's been hammering away at for four years. It's all about getting sport out there, getting disability sport more known, accepted and understood.

'She's aware that people look at her and they see a star athlete. She thinks it's important that people understand that she's just her. She just happens to be good at something that people look up to and have respect for.'

All eyes will be on David Weir today as he aims to clinch his fourth gold medal of the Games.

'The Weirwolf' has already set the Olympic Stadium alight with three outstanding performances in the 800m, 1,500m and 5,000m wheelchair track events.

Now the streets of London are expected to ring out with his trademark battle-cry 'howl' as he takes part in the marathon.

Weir's team-mates developed the 'Weirwolf' call after adapting it from the 1978 rock song Werewolves Of London, by Warren Zevon.

'It's pretty good,' said Weir, 33, who  was born with a severed spinal cord which left him unable to use his legs.

And Weir's exploits have certainly endeared him to fans. Sonny Carter, 12, from Hemel Hempstead, said: 'He makes me proud to be British.'

A paralympian who was forced to compete on one leg will return home with two, thanks to the Games' support team.

Haitian Josue Cajuste was born without half his left leg and could not afford a £5,000 prosthesis.

The 2010 Haiti earthquake also meant he had to train for the shot put and javelin among rubble.

The 29-year-old came last in the shot because he was unable to compete with other athletes who had prosthetics. Afterwards, Josue's coach pleaded for help from German prosthetic company Ottobock, which offers free services to Paralympians.

Technicians were so moved by his story they built him his first ever replacement leg.

With his new limb allowing him to take a run-up, Josue threw a Haitian record of 32m in Friday's javelin heats and finished 11th.

'The cheer of the crowd when I was on the runway was incredible,' he said. 'I shall never forget it.'
