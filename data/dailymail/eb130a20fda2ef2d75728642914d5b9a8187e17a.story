Having knocked a cyclist off his bike and through a hedge, most drivers would be mortified.

But not accountancy trainee Emma Way. The 21-year-old’s first thought was to boast about the incident on Twitter.

Writing under the name @emmaway20, she tweeted: ‘Definitely knocked a cyclist off his bike earlier – I have right of way he doesn’t even pay road tax! #bloodycyclists’.

Ironically, she would have heard no more about it had she not chosen to share it with the world because injured cyclist Toby Hockley had not intended to report it.

But by rejoicing in her actions, she caused a storm of protest on Twitter – and brought herself to the attention of the police.

Last night officers confirmed they were investigating Miss Way, while her Twitter account suddenly fell silent.

Her defence will not be helped by earlier tweets. One featured a picture which appeared to be taken from her driving seat, showing a slow-moving car in front.

The caption read: ‘This is the reason for my lateness. Always stuck behind some clueless crazy fool! #smartcar.’ Now angry cyclists who claim Miss Way is the ‘clueless crazy fool’ have forwarded that message to police. Another tweet on her account passed to officers featured a picture of a speedometer at 95mph – 25mph over the national limit.

But she must have realised the trouble she was in when she received the following Twitter message from Norfolk Police: ‘We have had tweets ref an RTC [road traffic collision] with a bike. We suggest you report it at a police station ASAP if not done already & then dm [direct message] us.’

Confession: This tweet by user EmmaWay20 was met with shock and prompted an investigation by Norfolk police

Mr Hockley, 29, a chef from Norwich, claimed he had ‘a miraculous escape’ after being clipped by her car on Sunday. He was taking part in the 100-mile Boudicca Sportive road riding event when the incident happened five miles from the finish line at Snetterton, near Norwich.

He said: ‘A car came tearing round the blind corner and narrowly missed a cyclist in front of me. She came on to my side of the road, I took the wing mirror off and I went flying off my bike into a hedge.

She hit me really hard. I am lucky to be alive. But I managed to get out of the hedge and stand up.

‘The car was nowhere to be seen. She hit me, and she was gone. All I know is that it was a blonde girl driving.

‘I have a sore elbow, a bruised knee, nettle stings from riding through the hedge, but nothing serious.’

Not angry: Mr Hockley, foreground, said he had not been planning any further action before he was alerted to the Tweet

He said he had not intended to report the accident, fearing that his girlfriend would be worried about him cycling in the future.

Of Miss Way, he said: ‘I think she came across as a very silly girl and made herself look like a bit of a fool. I’m not angry, I would just like it known that her stupid comment that I don’t pay road tax is not an excuse to treat cyclists like second-class citizens.’

Contacted by the Mail last night, Miss Way refused to comment. However a friend said she had been suspended from work at accountants Larking Gowen.

The friend claimed: ‘She stopped, but the other guy didn’t stop. She looked in the mirror and he was gone. It’s absolutely ridiculous. There was nobody marshalling the cyclists and they were going really fast.

‘She is a village girl who knows every pothole on every road round here. She made a stupid remark on Twitter but it’s all got out of hand.’

A police spokesman said: ‘Further to recent social media postings, we can confirm that we have had initial contact with both parties involved. Enquiries continue.'
