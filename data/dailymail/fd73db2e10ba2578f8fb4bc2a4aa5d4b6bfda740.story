Getting supplies to astronauts on the International Space Station can be a long, costly process and, unfortunately, UPS doesn't deliver to outer space.

However, this week, thanks to Made In Space's Zero-Gravity 3-D Printer, astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore got a ratcheting socket wrench he needed uplinked --or transmitted-- to him in space, CNN reports. 

Since its launch in September, the 3-D printer has made a total of 21 objects aboard the ISS, according to Business Insider, those objects had previously been tested on the printer with back-up files created.

On December 17, MIS designed, qualified, tested, and printed the wrench in space in less than a week, according to the MIS site.

Unlike the 21 objects printed before it, the wrench's design did not exist when the printer was first launched.

The wrench took four hours to print and the entire process took less than a week, CNN reports. 

The tool has rounded edges and finger grooves to make it 'more ergonomic and improve the grip,' according to MIS. 

The wrench will be returned to Earth, along with other 3-D printed parts, for observation and testing.

The 3-D printer is the first to operate in zero gravity, according to CNN, and printed its first object in November. The object was a part for the printer.  

In a news release, Niki Werkheiser, NASA's 3-D print manager, said the printer will be 'critical for exploration missions.' 

'This means that we could go from having a part designed on the ground to printed in orbit within an hour to two from start to finish,' Werkheiser said. 'The on-demand capability can revolutionize the constrained supply chain model we are limited to today...'

The printer will decrease cost, decrease risk, and increase efficiency, according to the news release.

The process of printing an object can take anywhere from 15 minutes to hours, depending on its size and complexity.

Manufacture: The printer receives a hardware code and can immediately begin manufacturing an object

The process of uplinking objects to the ISS includes designing the objects hardware, converting that hardware into a file-format the 3-D printer can read, sending the file to NASA, and, finally, transmitting the file to the ISS.

The zero-gravity printer then receives the code and can begin manufacturing the object immediately.

This new, innovative technology is a big step for space exploration. Normally, astronauts would wait anywhere between weeks and months for objects they needed in space. But now, thanks to the zero-gravity printer, astronauts no longer need to wait.

Other objects were previously printed in outer space, but the wrench was the first to be designed, tested, and printed to the ISS without previous testing
