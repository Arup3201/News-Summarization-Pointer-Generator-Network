VIDEO Scroll down to see the experts make their predictions

The wait is over: Carl Froch and George Groves finally meet at Wembley

(Former world light-welterweight champion)Groves knows he can hurt Froch; Froch knows he can hurt Groves. Froch won’t be so macho this time; he knows he can get knocked down. Verdict: FROCH

(Lost to Groves in 2011)I keep changing my mind. Groves boxed well last time but Froch is the champion; he has a lot of heart and a good chin.Verdict: GROVES

Composed: Amir Khan believes Froch will not be so 'macho' this time

Decisions: James DeGale keeps changing his mind but is going for George Groves

(Undefeated heavyweight)I don’t think Groves is world class but Froch will have to stop him because he won’t get a points decision. Verdict: FROCH

(Former undisputed world heavyweight champion)I think Froch will start quicker this time but he has to watch out for the big right hand from Groves. Verdict: FROCH

Backing the Cobra: Lennox Lewis believes Froch will have to watch out for Groves' right hand, while Tyson Fury doesn't think the west Londoner is world class, but that Froch will have to stop him

(Olympic super-heavyweight champion)Froch is experienced; Groves is skilful. Groves is likely to start sharp as he did last time, but I think Froch is going to break him down.Verdict: FROCH

(Former world cruiserweight champion)I don’t see this going the distance — they are too explosive. It’ll take a lot of concentration and control from Groves not to go for glory; the red mist can come down with him.Verdict: FROCH

Break down: Anthony Joshua thinks Froch will break down the more skilful Groves

Knockout: Johnny Nelson thinks Froch will knock Groves out - St George needs to keep his head as well

(British middleweight)As the fight goes on and the sharpness leaves Groves, Froch’s strength and stamina will become a factor. I’m leaning towards Froch by late stoppage or close points win.Verdict: FROCH

(World super bantamweight champion)Froch will start quicker this time, he can’t be as cagey and he’s got to have a tighter defence. I think he’ll be behind after six but will catch up in the later rounds. Verdict: FROCH

Factors: Froch's superior strength and stamina will play a part the longer the fight goes on

Quicker: Scott Quigg expects Froch to start quicker and then takeover in the later rounds

(British cruiserweight)Froch will be more wary this time. I can see Groves winning the first few rounds as he did in the first fight. But I expect a more conclusive stoppage for Froch, between rounds 8 and 12.Verdict: FROCH

(Former Team GB captain)My old GB team-mate Anthony Fowler has been sparring with Froch, and he says he is looking pretty good. I can see a Froch KO or Groves winning on points. If I had to bet I’d go for Froch.Verdict: FROCH

Two more for Carl: Both Tony Bellew (left) and Thomas Stalker are expecting Froch to retain his titles

I hope it lives up to the pre-fight talk. I like Groves’ style and he was unlucky not to win the first bout, but he might have missed his chance. I can’t see Froch making the same mistakes twice.Verdict: FROCH

I think it’s pretty much a 50/50 fight. Whoever performs best on the night will win; if I was betting I would bet on Froch to win.Verdict: FROCH

Hype: Jamie Carragher hopes the fight lives up to its billing and is banking on Froch

Too close to call: Andy Murray says it is too tight and down t whoever performs better on the night

Froch can’t box any worse than he did in the first few rounds last time. I change my mind every minute. They will come out slugging which is why I think it will be Froch in the early rounds.Verdict: FROCH

Groves shut a lot of people up last time. People thought he was just a mouthy little Londoner, but he walked the walk.Verdict: GROVES

Sluggers: Jamie Redknapp is expecting Carl Froch to score a knock out in the early rounds

Surprise: Jack Wilshere expects George Groves to win after 'shutting people up' in the first fight
