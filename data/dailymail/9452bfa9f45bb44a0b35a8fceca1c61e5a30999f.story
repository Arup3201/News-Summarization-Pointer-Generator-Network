He is under pressure to hand back his OBE and faces repaying a  fortune to the taxman.

But Gary Barlow can at least contemplate his misfortune in comfort – as he owns a portfolio of luxury homes worth at least £20million.

The Take That star, his manager Jonathan Wild and bandmates Howard Donald and Mark Owen were found last week to have poured £66million into a massive tax avoidance scheme.

In the Commons today, Prime Minister David Cameron condemned tax avoidance schemes and in a reference to the Take That hit said he want the 'money back for good'.

They now face repaying more than £20million between them to the taxman.

However, an analysis of Barlow’s property dealings reveals the 43-year-old has plenty to fall back on.

In 1995, as Take That were achieving international stardom, he bought Delamere Manor Estate in Cheshire for £1million. He went on to more than quadruple his money when it sold for £4.7million in 2005.

New owners Alan Murtagh and Michelle Stubbs later revealed that Barlow whisked them away to watch Take That perform in concert in Dublin with exclusive backstage passes when they were considering buying the huge estate.

Barlow moved his family into a luxury Georgian townhouse in Kensington, West London. It was sold to an investment banker with ties to an exclusive interior decorating firm for £6.85million in 2010.

Barlow owns properties worth more than £20million, including this house in West London which is thought to be valued at around £18million

More well-known stars have been dragged into the row over the Icebreaker tax avoidance scheme.

Sports stars, businessmen and celebrities were among 1,000 people to invest in the £36million scheme.

They include Olympic hurdler Colin Jackson and ex-England football manager Terry Venables, The Times reported.

Last
 week, a judge ruled Icebreaker Management – which styled itself as a 
music industry investment scheme – was a tax shelter that helped Gary 
Barlow, his manager Jonathan Wild and bandmates Howard Donald and Mark 
Owen save millions.

Jackson
 was a member of an Icebreaker partnership called Sparkdale which 
claimed losses of £9.4 million for its 25 members. MailOnline has 
contacted Jackson’s spokesman.

Venables
 invested in Starbrooke which spent £6.8 million on a book about 
Barcelona FC and two music albums but it generated just £1,937.

A
 spokesman for Venables told The Times he had ‘received absolutely no 
benefit whatsoever from [Icebreaker] and his tax affairs remain 
perfectly in order’.

While living in Kensington, he also bought a Grade-II listed 18th century home in the Cotswolds to enjoy at weekends.

He
 paid £2.3million for the five-bedroom house, set in large grounds, in 
2007. It is now estimated to be worth closer  to £4million.

Barlow regularly spends time at the home with his wife Dawn, 44, and three children Daniel, 13, Emily, 11, and Daisy, four. He has also been spotted in local pubs.

Supermodel Kate Moss and TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson have homes close to the village, which is in David Cameron’s constituency.

The Prime Minister and Barlow struck up a friendship after the singer joined him on the campaign trail for the 2010 General Election.

Mr Cameron was challenged about his links with Barlow during Prime Minister's Questions.

He said: 'I couldn’t have been clearer that I condemn all of these aggressive tax avoidance schemes, and more than just condemning them, this Government has taken action - legislative action - to say to people, to coin a phrase, "We want your money back for good".'

Back For Good reached number one in 1995.

Barlow’s main home is now in an exclusive road in West London.

He paid £12million for the detached property in 2010, but  experts now value it at £18million after intense interest from buyers from Russia and China. 

Last week, a judge ruled Icebreaker 
Management – which styled itself as a music industry investment scheme –
 was a tax shelter that helped Barlow, his manager and two bandmates 
save millions.

Barlow, who helped organise the Queen’s Jubilee party in 2012, was revealed as the biggest investor.

Yesterday
 Ed Miliband also criticised the Take That star. Asked if the scheme was
 unethical, the Labour leader said: ‘I think it’s wrong. People should 
pay their fair share of taxes.’

Alan Murtagh and Michelle Stubbs, who bought the house, later revealed Barlow took them to a Take That concert with backstage passes when they were considering the purchase

Mr Cameron has insisted the singer, a prominent Tory supporter, should be allowed to keep his OBE, saying it was awarded for the millions of pounds he helped to raise for the charity Children in Need.

But detractors including fellow  pop star Lily Allen last night continued to call for the honour to be removed.

The 29-year-old wrote on Twitter: ‘Can’t get through to NHSDirect, no midwives in your area? Well at least the Queen got a nice birthday party/jubilee, whatever @GaryBarlow.'
