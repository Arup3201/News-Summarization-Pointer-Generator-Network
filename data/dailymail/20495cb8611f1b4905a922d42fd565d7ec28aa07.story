An Army wife has been arrested for slashing the throats of her two-year-old toddler and six-month-old twins in their suburban Washington home, authorities say.

Christina Booth, 29,  called 911 at 1.20am on Sunday and told dispatchers that her three daughters were bleeding from their necks and wouldn't stop crying.

When police arrived at the family home in a tidy housing development in Olympia, Washington, they found all three children in an upstairs bedroom with life-threatening cuts to their necks.

All three children were rushed to Mary Bridge Children's Hospital, where they underwent surgery. 

Christina Booth, 29, is charged with slashing the throats of her her six-month-old twin daughters, as well as her toddler, on Sunday morning

A family friend says all three are improving. 

Booth's husband, Tommy Booth, is a US Army staff sergeant at nearby Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Neighbors told KIRO-TV that they saw a marked change in Mrs Both's behavior after he returned from his second tour of duty in Afghanistan - shortly before the twins were born. 

Mrs Booth's Facebook page boasts one photo that says 'I grow twins, what's your superpower?' She also posted a picture of a plaque her husband got for her that says: 'I have traveled many places and I have seen many things, but I have never, ever seen anyone as beautiful as my wife Christina.'

The attack horrified the family's neat suburban neighborhood in Olympia, where many military families live

It is believed Sgt Booth was home at the time of the attack. 

Both parents were questioned, though Sgt Booth was later released without charge. He was later seen going back to the house to retrieve belongings. 

Mrs Booth was charged with three counts of attempted murder. 

'To do that kind of damage or injury to three helpless human beings. I don't know that you can explain it,' Olympia police Lieutenant Tim Costa told KIRO.

Detectives say they have recovered the knife that was used in the attack. 

The children are in the custody of Child Protective Services.  

Neighbors said that Mrs Booth was lively and outgoing in the small community, where many families are in the military.

Then, when her husband returned home from Afghanistan, they started seeing much less of her. It was just about the time her twins were born.

'I can't imagine having three (children) under two. I'm sure she was going through a lot,' neighbor Tiffany Felch told KIRO.

The children are recovering after going into emergency surgery after paramedics found them with life-threatening injuries
