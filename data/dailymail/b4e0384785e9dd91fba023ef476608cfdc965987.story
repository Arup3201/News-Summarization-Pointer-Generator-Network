It's worth preparing for the worst of you are travelling to Bangkok as the Thai capital has the highest number of cases where the British Consulate has stepped in to help out Britons in trouble.

In research released by the Foreign Office for 2014, Bangkok emerged as the destination where most Britons found themselves in trouble on holiday, with the need for medical advice and attention the biggest reason.

Paris and Malaga followed Bangkok in the list, but both had almost a quarter of cases compared to that of the the Far Eastern city, where there were around 8,000 cases of Britons requiring overseas help.

A total of 84,000 British citizens required help from the Consulate last year around the world, ranging from medical and illness assistance, to help with arrests and lost property.

The report looked at each month of 2014, dissecting what cases were looked at where British government assistance was required.

As far as drug arrests were concerned, Spanish party-city Malaga topped the pile on the highest number of Britons requiring assistance with drug-related offences, with around 50 cases recorded.

Bangkok was again up there with around 33 cases, followed by the city of love Paris and Mexico  recording 33 cases apiece.

Bangkok has the highest number of Britons requiring British Consulate help in the world, with most concerning receiving adequate medical treatment

The summer season sees a dramatic increase in the number of drug-related offences - in July alone 150 Britons were arrested around the world adding more work for the foreign office.

Poor hygiene in Thailand contributes to Bangkok being ahead of everywhere else when it comes to cases of Britons needing hospital attention.

And of course, with the language barrier often leading to confusion, it's little surprise the British Consulate is called upon to mediate and ensure the right treatments are given.

Those countries that have a buzzing nightlife and club scene were also unsurprisingly high in the list where hospital treatment was required.

Malaga again made the top five, alongside Tenerife, Palma and Alicante. 

Numbers lower than five in the research were averaged between one and five, and so given as three for reporting purposes.

The clubbing scene appears to be linked to drug arrests, with more Britons arrested for these offences in Malaga than anywhere else

A spokesperson for the Foreign Office told MailOnline Travel: 'In light of the risk of unprovoked attacks you should be cautious and take care, especially at night.

'Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment resulting in accidents, injuries, robbery, assaults and lost travel documents. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Some British nationals in Thailand have suffered severe psychiatric problems because of drug use, resulting in some suicides.

'Be aware of the possibility of credit card fraud. Don’t lose sight of your card during transactions. There have been incidents of ATM skimming in Thailand. Where possible use an ATM within a bank and always protect your PIN.

'Be careful to observe demarcation lines between shops and stalls, particularly in market areas and at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Taking items from one shop’s area to another may be treated as suspected theft.

'Be on your guard against pickpockets and bag snatchers. Foreigners have had items snatched by thieves on motorbikes when walking along busy streets or travelling in open transport like tuk tuks. If you travel by bus, make sure cash and valuables you have are kept securely. There have been incidents where passengers have had items taken from bags while asleep.

'Gem scams are common. There have been reports of visitors buying gems for inflated prices from seemingly respectable establishments then later finding out the stones are worth a tiny fraction of the purchase price.

'You should report any incidents of crime to the Thai police before leaving the country.'
