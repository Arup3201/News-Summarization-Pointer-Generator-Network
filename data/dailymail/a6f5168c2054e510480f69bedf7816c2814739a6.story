Criticism: Carole and Mike Middleton's firm Party Pieces has been accused of cashing in ahead of the Duchess of Cambridge's tour of Australia

The Duchess of Cambridge's parents have been accused on cashing in on their daughter's forthcoming tour Down Under by selling a range of Australia-themed merchandise on their party supplies website

Kate and Prince William, together with their baby son George, are due to travel to Australia and New Zealand in April on behalf of the Queen.

Rumours that Kate's mother, Carole Middleton would join them to help care for the infant prince have been scotched by Royal insiders - however, the family firm Party Pieces is now stocking 'Australia Day' goods on its website.

Accompanied with the words 'Celebrate 
in the sun with our games and catering ranges!', the website is selling 
items such as flip flop notebooks for 20p each, and a three-pack of 
wayfarer-style sunglasses for 99p.

There
 are also flip flop printed balloons, red and blue party accessories 
such as plates and cups, and a 40ft long 'Coral Reef Scenesetter', 
available for £9.95.

Although
 the range is being promoted in time for the national celebration on 
January 26, two months before the royals are due to head to Australia, 
Party Pieces has been criticised for selling the products.

'It smacks of cashing in,' Royal fan Melanie Green, 45, told the Daily Star newspaper.

It is not the first time that Kate's parents, Carole and Mike have faced criticism over items sold on their website, which was promoting a range of baby goods following the announcement of the Duchess's pregnancy.

The firm, which was set up by Mrs Middleton in 1987, has also offered paraphernalia themed around the Royal Wedding and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

Its street party items included state carriage-shaped cardboard teapot vases, coat of arms cups printed with ‘Long Live G&T’ and canape flags featuring crown-wearing corgis.

The company – which Mrs Middleton started from scratch by making party 
bags around her kitchen table – had a dispute with Britain’s Got Talent 
after using the show’s logo on the site without permission and on 
another occasion fell foul of strict advertising laws covering the 
London Olympics.

It also rowed with Bond film producers Eon Productions 
after using the logo for the latest James Bond film, Skyfall.

In November last year the company was sanctioned for breaching environmental rules, and had to pay £12,650 to the Woodland Trust for apparently failing 'to ensure packaging is recycled in the UK'.

Party Pieces did not respond to requests for comment.
