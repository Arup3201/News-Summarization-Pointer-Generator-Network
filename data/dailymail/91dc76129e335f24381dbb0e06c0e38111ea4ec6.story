The schoolgirl who ran away with jailed teacher Jeremy Forrest has reportedly written three 'love notes' to him in prison saying she wants to get back together with him when he is freed.

Forrest, 31, is currently serving a five-and-a-half year sentence for sexual offences and abduction after fleeing to France with the girl when she was just 15.

According to reports, the girl, now 16, has sent Forrest three letters saying she still cares for him and wants to rekindle their relationship.

However, when authorities at Ashfield prison in Bristol refused to let him read the messages, he complained - apparently prompting him to be moved to the remote Dartmoor jail.

The schoolgirl, who cannot be named, is pictured with her teacher Jeremy Forrest aboard a Channel ferry as they head to France in September last year

The decision by prison bosses to prevent Forrest from reading the letters came after social workers banned the girl - who cannot be named for legal reasons - from speaking to him until she is 18. 

The disgraced teacher,
 who was told the letters had been sent,
 is understood to have complained to prison authorities, demanding to know if they had broken the rules by confiscating the letters without having 
carried out a risk assessment.

A source told The Sun: 'The girl has written three letters to him, which have been taken. She
 wants to be in contact with him.

'They are about wanting to be with him.
 They are warm messages to him. They're not dumping letters. She wants to continue a relationship with him.'

Forrest has reportedly complained to prison authorities after they refused to let him read the letters

Forrest's family believe that the decision to move him from Ashfield to Dartmoor is a direct result of the row over the letters, after he demanded to know whether the correct procedures had been followed when prison chiefs withheld the notes from him.

It had previously been reported that the schoolgirl had 'dumped' the teacher after finding a boyfriend her own age, but then broke up with her new lover because she still had feelings for Forrest.

The Prison Service has refused to comment on the reports of the girl's love letters.

Forrest triggered an international manhunt last summer when he fled with the 
girl. He had groomed her when she was one of his 14-year-old pupils
 at Bishop Bell School in Eastbourne, East Sussex.

After
 taking her virginity one week after her 15th birthday in his marital 
home, they left for France, using the names Jack Dean and Gemma Grant.

At
 first, the girl’s devastated family feared she had been kidnapped but 
soon after CCTV footage showed her with her arms around her teacher on 
board a ferry from Dover to Calais.

They were on the run for eight days before being found in Bordeaux where he was arrested in front of her.

He was convicted of child abduction and five counts of sexual activity with a child at Lewes Crown Court in June.

The girl has reportedly confided in friends that she is desperate to speak to the former teacher.

She had previously claimed in interviews that she wanted to have his children and would wait for him until he was released from prison.

Forrest
 began his relationship with the girl on a school trip to Los Angeles 
when she was 14 and was seen holding her hand on the plane – something 
she claims he was doing to comfort her as she was struggling with 
bulimia.

She opened up to 
him about the break-up of her parents’ marriage before he kissed her in a
 classroom. She said they would have sex in his Ford Fiesta or hotels, 
which they would check into as Mr and Mrs Forrest.

After
 Forrest was jailed, she said: ‘I love Jeremy so much. I don’t want 
anyone else. I want to spend the rest of my life with him and maybe once
 he’s out, we can marry and have children.’

The college student, now 16, claimed she instigated their escape to France, adding: ‘If anything, I groomed him.’

Forrest, who will have to sign the sex offenders’ register for life, has been divorced by his wife, Emily, 32, after she cited 'unreasonable behaviour' in divorce papers.

The former couple are believed to have sold the family home and divided the proceedings.
