Sen. Rand Paul told a group of college students on Wednesday that Ebola is 'incredibly contagious' and can spread from a person who has the disease to someone standing three feet away and said the White House should be honest about that.

His comments directly conflict with statements from world health authorities who have dealt with Ebola outbreaks since 1976.

Paul, a doctor and a presumed GOP presidential contender, made his comments during a stop at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire. In his remarks, he suggested Ebola could spread at a cocktail party attended by someone who is symptomatic, according to CNN video footage.

Paul has made similar comments in the wake of the first diagnosis of Ebola in the U.S. earlier this month.

The Kentucky senator told a conservative radio show host that 'we should not underestimate the transmissibility' of the virus and warned that society may not be 'making sound, rational, scientific decisions' about Ebola 'because of political correctness.' 

'It's a big mistake to downplay and act as if "oh, this is not a big deal, we can control all this." This could get beyond our control,' Paul, who has an MD in optometry from Duke University, told Laura Ingraham.

'My suspicion is that it's a lot more transmissible than that if people who are taking every precaution are getting it.'

Since Paul first lobbed the accusations at the government, two more people within the United States have come down with Ebola.

On Wednesday Paul said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention makes the transmission of Ebola sound similar to that of AIDS. Ebola, he says, is easier to contract.

'You're not going to get AIDS at a cocktail party. No one's going to cough on you and you're going to get AIDS. Everybody knows that. That's what they make it sound exactly like,' Paul said.

'But then you listen to them closely, they say you have to have direct contact. But you know how they define direct contact? Being within three feet of someone.'

Likewise in the epidemic zone in West Africa, people involved with burials of highly infectious bodies are at high risk.

'Should you be worried you might have gotten it by sitting next to someone?' Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said Wednesday. 'The answer to that is no.'

Still, Paul's team pointed to the CDC's website that says being within three feet of an infected patient for a prolonged period of time without the proper gear is a 'low-risk exposure' for Ebola.

'I think from the very beginning they haven't been completely forthright with us,' Paul told Bloomberg News on Thursday. 'They have so wanted to downplay this that they really, I don't think, have been very accurate in their description of the disease.' 

Politicians across the political spectrum have weighed in on President Barack Obama's response to the arrival of Ebola in the United States, with more than 40 calling for travel bans to West African countries that are being ravaged by the disease.

The first U.S. patient diagnosed with Ebola, Thomas Eric Duncan, came to the United States from Liberia shortly before his diagnosis. The other two people diagnosed with Ebola in the United States cared for Duncan when he was in the hospital. 

President Barack Obama said on Thursday that 'a flat-out travel ban is not the way to go.'

The White House explained Thursday afternoon that it believes that placing travel restrictions on Ebola hot spots will just encourage people from those countries who wish to travel to the U.S. to go 'underground' and find other ways to enter the country that allow them to bypass Ebola screenings.

It also asserted that a ban on travel from West Africa would make it difficult to send cargo critical to stopping the spread of Ebola to the region, as commercial airlines would most likely be unwilling to come back empty handed.

Instead, the president ordered heightened screenings at the international airports that 94 percent of West Africans come to America through.

Congressional lawmakers who participated in a rare recess hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday said they believed a moratorium on travel from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone is necessary to keep more carriers of the disease from entering the country.
