Maria Shriver is coming back to NBC News.

The network announced on Tuesday that Shriver will come back as a special 
anchor working on issues surrounding the shifting roles of women in 
American life.

Shriver previously worked at NBC beginning in 1986. In 2004, she left
to concentrate on her role as first lady of California when her former 
husband, Arnold Schwarzenegger, was governor.

Shriver said her mission with the new NBC job is to inspire and 
elevate humanity. The mother-of-four will be based in Los Angeles and 
will keep her own production company operating.

Return: NBC announced today that Shriver will rejoin the network as a special anchor working on issues surrounding the shifting roles of women in American life

Matt Lauer said to Maria Shriver today as it was announced she would be returning to the show, 'Welcome back to the family'

This morning, Matt Lauer said to his colleague on the Today show: 'Welcome back to the family.'

Shriver appeared on the program from Brentwood, California, where she was interviewing Tony award winning playwright Eve Ensler.

Shriver said she was excited to be returning to the network and 'profiling architects of change, like Ensler'.

She said: 'I look forward to shining a light on all areas of a woman's experience – from faith and finances, wellness and work, to relationships and the new realities of modern life – and exploring these issues in a way that brings the voices of men into these critically important conversations.'

The announcement was also posted on her blog, where she wrote: 'Wherever and whenever I could, I’ve collected people's stories and tried to tell them in ways that could empower them and others.

'The journalism is in me, so all my life, I've looked for platforms (films, books, live events, digital and social media) where I could engage my passions and my purpose.

'I’m excited to partner with old friends I’ve known forever -- and the new friends I’ve already made -- to amplify the work that I’ve dedicated myself to over the last decade.'

At home: Shriver's role in Today's Vatican coverage sparked rumors that she was due to make a return to the network

Rumors circulated last month that the
57-year-old may have been planning a return to the network after she 
made a surprise appearance with Lauer reporting on the papal conclave 
live from The Vatican.

She gave a special report from Rome titled 'Is there a stained-glass ceiling for women in the Catholic Church?'

Afterwards,
she laughed and joked with Lauer live in front of the Vatican and 
the pair interviewed Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the current Archbishop of 
New York, and Father Barron.

The
Today show has had a rocky year in the ratings stakes and even Lauer 
has admitted it didn't handle Ann Curry's exit from the show very well.

The
morning show is trailing it's ABC rival Good Morning America and is 
rumored to be looking for a new face to help it win back the hearts of 
the American people.

Shriver's
return has been incredibly well-received, with the Twitter-sphere tweeting their approval at the news.

Yesterday: The Today team took to Twitter on Sunday night, teasing that Ms Shriver, or as they put it 'an old friend,' would be making a return on Monday
