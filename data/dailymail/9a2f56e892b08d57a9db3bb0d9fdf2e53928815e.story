The Ohio football stars charged with raping a 16-year-old girl in a night of degradation and humiliation have been found guilty.

In emotional courtroom scenes, both defendants Trent Mays, 17, and Ma’lik Richmond, 16, wept uncontrollably as Judge Thomas Lipps handed down his verdict, describing their actions as ‘profane and ugly.’

As Mays and Richmond were comforted by their attorneys and their families sobbed, prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter pressed for a stern sentencing reminding the judge: ‘They showed absolutely no regard for what happened to the victim.

‘In the case of Mays once the information got out, there was a very conscious decision to turn it on her.

‘The lack of remorse was appalling’

Today, as both Steubenville High 
School students faced the reality of the consequences of what happened 
that August night last year, their remorse appeared overwhelming.

Both have been sentence to a minimum of one year in a juvenile detention institution with the maximum stay of until they are 21.

Mays faced an additional charge of the
 use and dissemination of nude images of a minor. He received the same 
sentence for that to run consecutively.

His minimum detention is two 
years.

His actions were, according to Judge 
Lipps, ‘more egregious’ making it inappropriate that he should face the 
same sentence as Richmond.

Trial by social media: The messages over Twitter, Instagram and text that were exchanged that night and the next day have become central to the case - and to the outrage it has caused nationwide

Verdict: Two protestors hug outside the Jefferson County Justice Center after hearing the verdict in the trial

Richmond’s father, Nathaniel, who has 
been present in court every day made his way over to his son, fell to 
his knees and told him that he loved him.

‘My life is ruined,’ Richmond told attorney his Walter Madison, who was clearly shocked at the verdict.

Mays father, Bryan, held his head in his hands as the defendant’s sister Rhiannan and mother wept.

Both defendants took the opportunity 
to address the victim and her family – present for the verdict and 
visible to the defendants but out of view of the main court in a 
screened off section of seating.

Mays was composed as he said: ‘I would
 like to apologize to [the victim] and her family, my family and the 
community. No pictures should have been sent let alone ever taken.’

But though Mays apologized quite specifically for taking pictures of the victim and sending them nowhere did he mention or offer an apology for the rape.

In every communication with the victim following the night of 11 -12 August he repeatedly denied raping her.

In fact in an incriminating detail it is an allegation he denies before it is ever made. Again and again his texts show him turning the blame on the victim, hectoring her, pressurizing her not to go to the police and telling her that the rape ‘didn’t happen.’

Standing in court, convicted of that crime and filled with apparent regret, the rape remained a crime for which he does not apologize.

When it came to Richmond’s turn, he 
walked towards the victim and her family, across the courtroom, weeping;
 ‘I would like to apologize. I had no intention to put you guys through 
this. I’m sorry. I don’t know what to say.

‘I ruined her life.’

At this, he could no longer speak  
because he was overcome with tears, and was walked back to this seat by 
Fred Abdalla Jr, Chief Probation Officer for Jefferson County Juvenile 
Court.

Apologies followed from Bryan Mays, 
Greg Aggresta – Richmond’s guardian who, along with his wife Jennifer 
have been in court every day. The Aggresta’s have spoken openly about 
their support for Richmond and love for him ‘whatever happened.’

Today in court they appeared emotionally shattered. Richmond was not in their care when the events took place.

The Ohio rape convictions do not mark the end of the scandal that has gripped the small town of Steubenville and America at large.

Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, right, answers questions about the successful prosecution of two juveniles

Ohio State Attorney General Mike DeWine has revealed that a Grand Jury will be called on April 15 with as many as 16 other youths facing possible charges.

Speaking just moments after Judge Thomas Lipps handed down his verdict, Ohio State Attorney Mike DeWine has revealed: ‘We’ve gone a long way in this investigation and we’re almost there. The grand jury will finish up that investigation.’

He said that there were 16 people of interest who had so far refused to co-operate with the investigation. 

The Grand Jury will seek to resolve this and while he acknowledged it is more commonly concerned with criminal cases in the adult court he said it also served as ‘an investigating tool’ in matters relating to Juvenile Court.

The three key prosecution witnesses – all of whom admitted being present and participating in the events of August 11-12 – were all granted immunity on condition of their testimony.

Many campaigning groups have heavily criticized the controversial decision but it was a decision that the victim’s family understood as solicitor Mr Bob Fitzsimmons explained:

‘You had three boys, eye witnesses to what happened. They [Attorney General’s office} had to make a difficult decision to grant three people we all think were probably criminally liable immunity.

‘Their conduct was reprehensible and despicable but sometimes you have to make deals.’

All three could still face charges outside the State of Ohio if they are found to have sent nude images of a minor across county lines.

The victim herself is from Weirton, barely three miles from Steubenville but across state lines and in West Virginia.

Summing up: Judge Thomas Lipps listens to prosecuting attorney Marianne Hemmeter give a closing argument Saturday; he declared the defendants guilty today

Mr Madison said: ‘To some extent they blame themselves.’

It would be hard to understate the 
intensity of the courtroom scenes as all three young people  - 
defendants and victim – and their families took in the devastation this 
case has wrought on their lives.

This was not a time of jubilation on the victim’s family’s part – they declined the opportunity to address the court.

This was a time for the defendants to 
absorb the fact that this finding will be, as Mr Madison put it, ‘an 
escort for the rest of their lives.’

Across days of often appalling testimony the court has heard texts, tweets and emails between the defendants and their friends.

Small town: Both defendants played football for Steubenville High School's team Big Red

They have heard about pictures, been 
reminded of vile video rants and seen the reality of what these boys did
 and how they behaved, who they were, when nobody else was looking.

The case has scandalized America and scarred the small town of Steubenville, Ohio.

Mays and Richmond will begin their 
sentence today. They will be taken to an institute just northwest of 
Columbus, Ohio where they will be assessed and a decision made as to 
where they should spend their time in custody.

‘So much of what happens with their 
future depends upon their attitude and how they embrace their 
rehabilitation,’ said Judge Lipps.

‘There is plenty of room to demonstrate your good character. There is also plenty of room to make mistakes.’
