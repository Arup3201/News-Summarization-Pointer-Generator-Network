Former West Ham midfielder Jack Collison has joined Ipswich Town on a short-term contract.

The Welsh international has been without a club since leaving Upton Park in the summer following nine years with the Hammers.

Collison spent time on trial at Portman Road recently, as well as Birmingham and QPR.

Mick McCarthy had given up hope of signing the 25-year-old, but Collison has now penned a deal with the Tractor Boys that runs until December.

His time in east London was plagued by injury problems, restricting him to 121 appearances since signing from Cambridge United in 2007.

Collison spent time on loan at Bournemouth and Wigan Athletic last season before leaving the Hammers at the end of the campaign.
