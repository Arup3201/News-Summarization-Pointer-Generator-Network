A win is always a win and England will go into next week’s game against France with a fighting chance of winning the Six Nations but they will be annoyed with themselves for leaving so many points out there on the field.

It’s all going to come down to points difference, and its nip and tuck with Ireland, but those points England left out there at Twickenham could cost them dear.

The biggest positive I would draw out of the game is that there was plenty of creativity – George Ford and Ben Youngs led the way – and at least England were making try-scoring opportunities. This was no sterile kicking performance and with a bit more experience I'm hoping England will start putting good teams away comfortably.

George Ford breaks away to score England's second try on a nerve-wracking afternoon 

Ben Youngs gave England options with a display of much-needed creativity against an obdurate Scotland

Ford in particular was composed and was confident enough to slow the game down on occasions to allow play to come to him. He’s got time on the ball and some of England’s other exciting young backs must look to emulate that

The first half was extraordinary in many ways and spelt out the absolute necessity of taking your chances in Test rugby because it almost invariably comes back to haunt you.

England started at a good tempo - which they definitely needed to after going behind early on in their last three Six Nations games - but they failed to take full advantage and put away three or four gilt-edge chances.

Luther Burrell made a strong break in the first minute which should have led to a try but he showed no composure. He neither slowed down to allow Anthony Watson to get to him on his right nor did he look for Youngs steaming up on his inside. Instead he just went to ground and even then England didn’t recycle very well.

England did score a fine try during this period which saw them at their best with Ford taking the ball to the line and Jonathan Joseph again showing that brilliant footwork of his to beat Hogg but then the sloppiness crept in again.

Jonathan Joseph scored England's first try to give the hosts hope of a rout, but that did not materialise

Jack Nowell had been hungry for work and made an excellent initial burst but failed to transfer the ball to two hands which immediately limited his choice. He had the perfect arrowhead, support players on his left and right, but with the ball in one arm went to ground ineffectively.

England also looked odds on to score at a scrum five having completely dominated Scotland in the previous scrum but then inexplicably gave a penalty away for coming in on the angle.

Another try went begging when Mike Brown got dragged down by Stuart Hogg. There’ s no disgrace in being caught by Hogg who is a real speed merchant and I’m pretty sure Brown had lost a boot as well, but would like to have seen more support on his shoulder.

Almost predictably Scotland hit back an scored with their very first serious attack to level the scores and in many ways England were possibly lucky to only trail 13-10 at half-time. That was definitely a yellow card when Dan Cole stepped into play the ball earlier at a ruck when Scotland were camped on England’s line!

Half-time will have been interesting in the England changing room and England looked a different beast for most of the second half and regained control of the match with Ford's try but then again we saw that lack of composure.

Tom Youngs made a terrific break immediately after coming on as a replacement picking a wonderful angle but then lost his head completely and flung the wildest of passes to nowhere.

Yet again if he had just slowed down for a second and picked his support runner there would probably have been a try. Moments later Watson was nearly through but again went to ground without looking for his support and Mike Brown slightly over-ran that pass form James Haskell.In the furnace of international rugby you must play it cool on occasions

Finally at the end they killed Scotland off with a well taken try by Nowell England should look carefully of why it took so long.

Good show: England will have to taken heart from the attacking intent if not the finishing. Jack Nowell worked very hard and took his late try well and Jonathan Joseph again demonstrated how he can unpick the tightest defences with his footwork. Youngs and Ford were really lively at half-back, Lawes added physicality up front

Bad show: England have to recapture the coolness under pressure and ruthless streak they showed in the second half against Wales in Cardiff. That is what wins you big rugby matches. They made life so difficult for themselves  with their lack of precision and not building a score. Scotland took heart and scavenged like they always did.

But it is nip and tuck and their inability to score more against the Auld Enemy could come back to haunt them

There was plenty of creativity, with Ben Youngs and George Ford both in good form
