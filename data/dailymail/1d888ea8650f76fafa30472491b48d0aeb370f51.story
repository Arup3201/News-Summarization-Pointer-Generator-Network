She's back: Rosie O'Donnell will return to The View

Rumours have been swirling this week that O'Donnell would rejoin the struggling daytime chat show, which only recently ousted Jenny McCarthy and Sherri Shepherd.

O'Donnell will co-host the show with Goldberg, who replaced the controversial star as moderator when she left on a bad note after just eight months on April 30, 2007.

The brunette replaced Meredith Vieira as a moderator on The View in September 2006.

She returns as The View's longtime executive producer and co-creator Bill Geddie leaves. It was no secret that Rosie and Bill were often at loggerheads - a situation that only intensified after Rosie's 2007 explosive on-air row with former View co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck over the Iraq war.

Geddie egged on the right-wing Hasselbeck via her earpiece, and cut to a cable news-type split-screen of the duo going head to head.

A source told MailOnline that more producers have also been fired as the show plans a revamp - adding: 'Everyone thinks the reason that Bill's going is because ABC wanted to bring Rosie back and they hate each other so much, there is no way they could work together.'

And it's also claimed that Sherri Sheperd quit The View after learning Jenny was being fired - and Bill was going.

Meanwhile, the source said that Whoopi Goldberg, the show's moderator, has a three year 'pay or play' deal - and while unhappy at the show's many changes, would lose $12 million if she walked away.

Today, Whoopi addressed many of the rumors surrounding the show on air, saying: 'I just have something on my mind. You know there is a lot of speculation about a lot of stuff going on here. Yes, I'm here. We don't know who's coming in, but I will tell you this: The respect that I have for the people who work here will not change.

'I will do my best to respect the audience, to make sure that we bring you The View that Barbara Walters wanted you to have, which is women talking about issues. We are not little kids, we are grown a** women. And so, I'm just tired of people saying, 'oh, you know if this one comes in, or if this one comes in,' I don't argue with people, we have spirited discussions.'

She continued, "I don't fight with people, that's not my way. Quit trying to make me into something I'm not. I'm not a little girl with cat claws. I am not a cat, I am a human being. I am a girl with a fist. And so, I'm just telling y'all, The View is going to evolve as it always has. Quit trying to make something happen and let whatever's going to happen, happen, and we hope you will join us when we come back."

A rousing welcome: O'Donnell, who got a 
standing ovation when she appeared on The View in February for the first
 time since quitting the show in 2007, allegedly drove a hard bargain to secure her 'one-year, seven-figure deal'

O'Donnell allegedly drove a hard bargain to secure her 'one-year, seven-figure deal', according to Page Six.

The
 star allegedly demanded a say on who will take a seat at The View table
 next season, and she does not want any reality stars on the cast.

O'Donnell hasn't officially commented on the news.

But she tweeted a picture on Thursday morning showing her holding her baby daughter Dakota and joined by her son Blake as she enjoys a swim at a Florida beach.

'Nothing like Florida - pure joy,' she wrote in the caption.

O'Donnell's short tenure on The View resulted in several controversies, including an on-air dispute regarding the Iraq War, resulting in a mutual agreement to cancel her contract.

However, she is credited with making the show more news-focused and increasing viewership.

Despite an overall downward trend for most daytime broadcast shows, ratings rose by 27% during O'Donnell's first year on The View, according to Variety in 2007.

Also linked to join O'Donnell is Meghan McCain, the daughter of former Presidential candidate Senator John McCain, who will co-host The View next week.

According to The Wrap, McCain, the co-host of Pivot's TakePart Live, would provide a conservative voice to the ABC show, taking on the role previously held by Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

The 29-year-old blonde 'presents herself as a progressive Republican who doesn't always agree with her party on social issues, such as gay marriage'.

However, she is under contract on TakePart Live, and it is unclear whether she could join The View full-time.

Meanwhile, rumours that O'Donnell would re-join the cast did not sit well with her one-time co-host and arch nemesis Elizabeth Hasselbeck, who did not mince words when addressing the possible comeback this week.

O'Donnell infamously clashed with conservative pundit Hasselbeck, who took umbrage with some of O’Donnell’s statements about the Iraq War.

Hasslebeck, 37, hosted The View for a decade before joining Fox and Friends last year.

On Wednesday, Hasselback, who is currently on vacation, called into her show to weigh in on O'Donnell's potential comeback, expressing nothing but contempt for her former colleague.'What could ruin a vacation more than to hear news like this?' the Fox presenter quipped before launching into a tirade that resurrected the specter of her past on-air battles with O'Donnell.

'Talks about not securing the border,' 
the conservative commentator ranted. 'Here in comes to The View the very
 woman who spit in the face of our military, spit in the face of her own
 network... coming back with a bunch of control ready to regain a seat 
at The View table.’

But O'Donnell's other former The View co-host Joy Behar criticised Hasselbeck's 'hate-filled' remarks.

'I thought that was really kind of below-the-belt, to say she spits in the face of the military. I would like Elisabeth to explain herself," she told CNN's Don Lemon on Wednesday night, mentioning that O'Donnell's eldest son is in military school.

'What does she mean by that? And isn't it kind of a nasty thing to say about somebody who basically is a good person? That's a dangerous thing to say about somebody. I think it's a hate-filled remark.'

O'Donnell, meanwhile, responded to Hasselbeck's comments via Twitter.

One fan wrote to her: '@Rosie, @etnow @ehasselbeck way to spin words by saying you spit in faces of our servicemen - she's becoming a great FAUX News anchor.'

O'Donnell replied:' @MatPat82 - think she has donated any money to the armed services???? Hmmmmm.'

ABC explained the recent changes to the show in a statement on Friday saying: ‘The View will be moving in an exciting new direction next season, and ABC has made decisions to evolve the show creatively.'

Both McCarthy and Shepherd broke the news that they would be leaving last Thursday on Twitter.

At first the Scary Movie star suggested she was leaving in support of Shepherd's dumping. The model turned actress wrote: 'If Sherri goes . . . I go too,” adding “#sisters.'

She then later wrote: 'My View will be changing too. As will with many hard working folks. Thanks to everyone at the show for your dedication and an amazing year.'

Not the only one: Co-star Sherri Shepherd's contract was not renewed after seven years with the talk show

Showing the close bond she and Shepherd had, McCarthy posted an image of the pair with two other members of The View production team saying, 'These are my Avengers and we will be back!'

However, it has been reported that the blonde had been dumped from the role, which she had held since just September, as she did not appeal to daytime audiences.

It is not known why her 47-year-old co-star's contract was not renewed.

Confirming her exit, Shepherd released a statement to Deadline.com earlier on Thursday.

She said: 'It’s been seven wonderful years on The View and after careful consideration it is time for me to move on.

'I am extremely grateful to Barbara Walters and Bill Gedde for giving me the opportunity.'

She added: 'I look forward to the business opportunities that lay ahead for me and I am incredibly grateful to my View family and my fans for supporting me on this journey.'
