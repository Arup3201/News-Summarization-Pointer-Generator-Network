A young man who is torn between  the rough streets of his hometown and a bright future as a basketball star is poised to make a splash in March Madness after keeping his brother away from violence.

Isaiah Williams, a 22-year-old forward and junior at Iona College, says he has lost 24 of his friends and loved ones to violence in a section of Newark, New Jersey, called The Jungle.

Teammates say that the star 6'7'' player has gone through periods of crying regularly at practice after losing some of his best friends to shootings related to drugs and gangs, but works harder than anyone.

Though his team stands on the brink of the national spotlight, Williams has never been fully free of the forces pulling him back to the troublesome past where his loved ones still live.

After the death of friend Rahmel Johnson, 20, in 2013, the basketball star left his college life without telling his coaches and went back home to intervene with his brother Kevin, a year younger.

Newark's Oscar Miles Village is controlled by the Crips gang and surrounded by rivals, and Williams felt he had to pull his brother, who was with Johnson right before his targeted shooting, out of a dangerous life, according to NJ.com. 

The guard, who has Family First tattooed on his chest, returned when Kevin vowed to stay off the streets.

This season Williams helped lead Iona to first place in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and his brother Kevin attends his games.

His life at college is a far cry from his time growing up, where he was immersed in violence that saw him shot at three times.

Gunmen sprayed shots at him near his neighborhood rec center, after a fight and riding in a car through a rival neighborhood.

The basketball star gives a litany of his friends who have been killed in similar incidents: P-Roc, Smoove,  Goldie, Capo, T Ram, Hot Dog and many others.

Though the star forward dropped everything and went to intervene in his brother's life last season, the 6'7'' player has led Iona College to first place in their conference this year

Oscar Miles Village in Newark is controlled by the Crips gang, and rivalries with surrounding gangs lead to a high homicide rate.

There were 111 homicides in Newark in 2013. 

While others were never had a chance leave, Williams found his escape in basketball.

'My friends wanted me to join them. At one time I did, but when I got a little older I said, 'I have to go shoot baskets.' It was my therapy. It took my mind off everything that was around me,' he told the Bradenton Herald.

Mr Williams attended seven high schools and colleges before arriving at Iona, and was named Suncoast Conference Player of The Year at State College of Florida Bradenton before transferring to a Division I school closer to home.

Iona's location New Rochelle, New York, means he help his loved ones such as Kevin, and his girlfriend Ille and family have been able to watch him thrive despite an injury this season.

He now shoots more than 50 per cent from the floor and averages more than 13 points per game while majoring in criminal justice.

Recovering from hardship and improving himself have always been part of his mindset.

'He would beg me to try to get me into the gym with him. I would have to open the gym for him late at night and early in the morning,' his coach in Florida and current assistant coach Brock Erickson told One-Bid Wonders. 

The Iona Gaels play Siena College on Saturday, with a shot at the NCAA tournament if they advance and can claim their conference championship.

Beyond hoping to make an impact at this year's college basketball postseason, Mr Williams hopes that he can make it even further.

He has hopes to play in the NBA or Europe.

'I'm going to try to go as hard as I can and if possible make the NBA,' he said. 'That's what I want to do. If I don't get drafted, okay. I'm just going to keep going, and one day hopefully I'll be there.'
