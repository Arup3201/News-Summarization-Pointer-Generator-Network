Sportsman-turned-politician Imran Khan will formally announce his marriage on Friday, sources at a Pakistani television station have said.

It is understood Khan's new wife Reham - the former BBC weather girl he wed in secret last month - has invited colleagues to the announcement.

A source at Dawn TV, the private news channel where she works, also revealed the new Mrs Khan has also invited her make up artist to Friday's event, although Mr Khan officially confirmed they were married yesterday. 

The source added: 'She has also shown willingness to start her regular programme for TV from next week.'

Ms Khan, a divorced mother-of-three, was a BBC weather girl but is now a news anchor of AAJ TV

Imran Khan arrives at Heathrow Airport last week when, at the time, he said rumours he had married were 'greatly exaggerated' 

The formal announcement comes after a turbulent week for the couple, who have incited the wrath of Mr Khan's family and the wider public in Pakistan.

Yesterday, a friend of Mrs Khan, 41, told how she was suffering emotional turmoil after being trolled over her marriage to the Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician. 

Some social media users have accused the divorced mother-of-three of being a lesbian and one image even claims to show her in a sex shop.

A producer at Dawn TV told MailOnline that the backlash had left the broadcaster 'very disturbed'.

The source said: 'She is not in the right state of mind after seeing the reaction of trolls on social media after news of her marriage with Imran Khan was disclosed.

'She has not been conducting her daily programme as well. She is very disturbed by the way she is being portrayed on social media.'  

Denial: Imran Khan's sister Aleema said the family had a showdown with the politician and he denied the secret marriage

It came as Mr Khan spoke out against the storm surrounding his  wedding, telling his critics that marriage is not a crime.  

His sister Aleena reacted with anger at the news, saying she doesn't want to meet the new Mrs Khan. 

Told by MailOnline that her brother had revealed he was actually married, Aleema Khan - who claimed the rumours were started by opposition politicians looking to discredit her brother - said: 'Really? Really? Let's see if he announces it officially. I am taken aback.  

'This is a real challenge for him. We haven't met her and I don't know that we want to meet her.

'It is his decision, he is a grown up. It is more important how the children feel. 

'I suppose in any situation like this the children will not feel good about it. They do look up to their father.' 

Speaking amid a political storm surrounding rumours of the marriage, she said she hoped Reham Khan 'will be good for Pakistan and our brother'.

She added: 'It all depends on how the public respond to it. The biggest surprise is how everybody in Pakistan feels they have a right to participate in the decision. 

'He is a grown man, we are watching the situation unfold.'  

But speaking from his home in Islamabad today, Mr Khan launched a robust defence of his actions and of his new bride, declaring: 'A person can marry whenever he/she wants.'

He pointed to the fact that he had in no way deceived his wife and insisted that he put his two teenage children first when coming to a decision.  

The 62-year-old said: 'I didn't think of my marriage for 10 years after my divorce because my children were small. I do not ever think of hurting my children's feelings.' 

'I hope he will be happy': Jemima Goldsmith, the ex-wife of Imran Khan, has offered her congratulations to the former cricketer 'on this new phase in his life' after he announced his marriage to a former BBC weather girl

After the wedding was officially confirmed by Khan yesterday following days of speculation, Ms Goldsmith took to Twitter to express her happiness for the newlyweds

Khan's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith has been among those to offer her congratulations to the former cricketer.

She tweeted: 'I hope Imran will be happy in this new phase of his life.' 

Ms Goldsmith, who divorced Khan in 2004 after nine years of marriage and has two teenage sons with him, also spoke of her fondness for Pakistan. 

Ms Goldsmith revealed in October that she was ditching the surname 'Khan' and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry.

She said at the time: 'My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it's probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.'  

Khan married Ms Goldsmith in a traditional Islamic ceremony in Paris in 1995.  

What Mrs Khan's former in-laws think of the marriage is less clear.

Reham, who was born in Libya to Pakistani parents, has three children from her previous marriage to a doctor. 

Fazlur Rehman, her ex-father-in-law, a retired major in the Pakistan army, refused to speak to reporters when they approached him.

Mr Khan insisted that he put his two teenage children first when coming to a decision about marriage

Reham Khan is understood to have moved into the house with her youngest daughter, according to her former colleague and friend.  

The Daily Mail's diarist Sebastian Shakespeare broke the news of Khan's marriage to the broadcaster last week. 

On New Year's Eve, Mr Khan said rumours of marriage were 'greatly exaggerated' and his sister Aleema said the family challenged him 'a few days ago' over the news and he denied it.

But speaking to reporters at Heathrow airport last night before boarding a flight to Pakistan, Khan is reported to have said: 'I am going to Pakistan to share good news about my marriage with the nation. I have nothing to hide.'

More details are beginning to emerge about the marriage - including the fact it was presided over by Mufti Saeed, said to be a leading Islamic scholar.

Mufti Saeed is understood to have been arrested after a failed  plot by Islamic militants within the Pakistan army, according to the Telegraph. 

Mufti Saeed has neither denied nor admitted that he was the person who oversaw the marriage.

However, he told a MailOnline source people would soon learn about the wedding.

The contact claimed that Mufti Saeed was selected a member of core committee of PTI after his service for Imran.

The 41-year-old lived in Britain for part of her previous marriage, when she was a weather girl and presenter on BBC regional news programme South Today
