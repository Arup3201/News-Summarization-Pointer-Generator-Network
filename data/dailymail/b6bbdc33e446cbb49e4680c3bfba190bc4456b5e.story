Parish priest: Pope Francis enjoys surprising his followers with phone calls to keep himself grounded

A widow ‘adopted’ by Pope Francis after losing two of her four children has told how he moves her to tears every time he calls her.

The pontiff revealed in an interview that makes monthly phone calls to a grieving woman.

As pope he has less contact with ordinary people and it gives him satisfaction to ‘act the role of parish priest’, he explained.

Rosalba Ferri, 77, from Pesaro, Italy, lost her son Andrea Ferri when he was hit by six bullets, during a robbery at the petrol station where he worked, in June last year.

Mrs Ferri had already had a son die many years before when he was a baby. She now cares for one son with Downs Syndrome and another who is in a wheelchair following a car accident.

The heartbroken grandmother said that the unexpected phone calls move her to tears.

She told Italian newspaper La Nazione: ‘He always surprises me. He says ‘Ciao Rosalba, it’s Pope Francis’. And I never know what to say. During the call I always end up crying.

She added: ‘He asks me how I am and I say “Terrible: I miss Andrea.” He understands me. He says that a mother should never have to bury their child and he says that he thinks of me often.’

The mother-of–four, who goes to her son’s grave every week to talk to him, added: ‘We have never had such a good pope. He is a humble person. He really cares for those in need.’

Mrs Ferri says that she does not tell many people outside the family about the attentive phone calls:

She said: ‘I told the parish priest Father Mario and he said, “But the Pope never calls me!” And he said he will go with me to Rome to meet the Pope.’

Widow Rosalba Ferri, 77, said: 'I never know what to say. During the call I always end up crying'

Francis apparently enjoys surprising those who write to him with unexpected phone calls.

On New Year’s day he called a group of nuns in Spain and left a voicemail.

Last year he called a pregnant Italian woman whose married boyfriend had unsuccessfully pressured her to have an abortion. The pope offered to personally baptise the baby when it is born.
