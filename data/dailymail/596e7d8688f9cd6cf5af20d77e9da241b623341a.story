George Osborne has been ordered to face questions at the Leveson Inquiry over his role in the Government’s handling of the Murdoch empire’s attempted BskyB takeover.

The Chancellor had been expected to give only a written statement, but the inquiry into Press ethics has asked to cross-examine him on Monday.

Mr Osborne and Prime Minister David Cameron lead a heavyweight cast of  witnesses next week, including former prime ministers Gordon Brown and Sir John Major, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband.

Under pressure: Chancellor George Osborne, right, and Prime Minister David Cameron will face a grilling at the Leveson Inquiry next week over their handling of the BskyB takeover

Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne will face 
embarrassing questions about their wining and dining with Murdoch 
executives, including former News International chief executive Rebekah 
Brooks.

And they will 
be quizzed about their decision to recruit Andy Coulson, the former News
of the World editor, as No 10 communications director after he had 
resigned from the paper over the phone-hacking scandal.

Senior
sources say the Prime Minister will fire a warning shot at Lord Justice
Leveson on Thursday, making clear that the Government will not adopt 
new plans for regulating the Press that stifle freedom of speech.

The sources have told the Daily Mail he will emulate Education Secretary Michael Gove by ‘putting down a marker’ that Press freedom must be preserved at all costs.

Lord Justice Leveson has spoken of his desire for his recommendations on Press regulation to be backed by all political parties.

But some Tories are concerned the Government will not be able to support his proposals if they go too far.

One source said Mr Cameron’s message will be ‘Gove-lite’.

‘The starting point has to be that what comes next does not inhibit the freedom of the Press.

‘This is Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry but David will put down a marker about where he stands.’

Revealed: Leveson has shown how close Mr Cameron was to Rebekah Brooks and other senior NI figures

Mr Osborne will be asked about his contacts with Mr Hunt on the day the Culture Secretary took over responsibility for ruling on the  BSkyB bid from Vince Cable, whose hostility to the Murdochs had been exposed.

Mr Hunt texted the Chancellor to say he was ‘seriously worried we are going to screw this up’.

Mr Osborne replied: ‘I hope you like the solution!’ – a reference to Mr Hunt’s appointment to oversee the deal.

Mr Brown, making his first major public appearance in a year on Monday, will face questions about claims by Rupert Murdoch that he threatened to ‘destroy’ his media empire after The Sun newspaper switched allegiance to the Tories.

GORDON BROWN

Mr Brown is likely to give his version of the incident in which he is 
said to have told Rupert Murdoch he had declared war on his media empire
after The Sun switched its support to the Conservatives in September 
2009.

Mr Murdoch told the inquiry in April that Mr Brown had rung him
in an 'unbalanced' state of mind.

The billionaire businessman said his 'warm personal relationship' with Mr Brown broke down after this.

The former premier might also discuss The Sun's 2006 story about his son Fraser having cystic fibrosis.

GEORGE OSBORNE

Mr Osborne will be asked about his role in the appointment of Andy Coulson and could also be questioned over any role 
he had in the BSkyB saga after it emerged during Mr Hunt's evidence 
that, after expressing his concerns, the Culture Secretary had been 
texted by the Chancellor on the subject.

Less than an hour before 
responsibility for the bid was transferred to Mr Hunt from Vince Cable, Mr Osborne sent 
him a message saying: 'I hope you like the solution.'

SIR JOHN MAJOR

Former
Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie recalled one conversation with the 
then-prime minister, on the night the UK crashed out of the European 
Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992.

Mr
MacKenzie said he told Sir John: 'I've got a bucket of s*** on my desk,
prime minister, and I'm going to pour it all over you,' when the 
then-leader asked how the story was going to be covered in the paper the
next day.

Senior Labour figures are worried that Mr Miliband, who gives evidence on Tuesday, will be quizzed about the behaviour of his chief spin-doctor Tom Baldwin.

Mr Baldwin, a former journalist for the Murdoch-owned Times, wrote a memo urging Shadow Cabinet members to go soft on criticism of News Corporation.

Mr Brown and Mr Osborne will appear on Monday, Sir John, Mr Miliband and
Ms Harman on Tuesday and Mr Clegg and Scottish First minister Alex Salmond on Wednesday.

But it is the Prime Minister's evidence that is likely to take centre stage.

His friendship with former newspaper 
boss Rebekah Brooks has been under scrutiny, after she said he texted 
her regularly, often signed off his text messages to her with ‘LOL’, 
which he wrongly believed stood for ‘lots of love’.

Mr
Cameron has also been forced to confess that he rode her horse Raisa 
with Mrs Brooks’s husband Charlie, which was lent to her by the Met 
between 2008 and 2010. It even came out he went to her house for 
Christmas dinner.

Also, he was dragged last month into 
Jeremy Hunt's handling of the BSkyB takeover bid after it was revealed 
the Culture Secretary privately urged David Cameron to back Rupert 
Murdoch’s offer just weeks before the Prime Minister put him in charge 
of ruling on the issue.

In
a bombshell email, the Culture Secretary lavished praise on the £8 
billion bid and Mr Cameron then put him in charge of the quasi-judicial 
decision.

Mr Cameron 
judged afterwards that the Culture Secretary had acted 'properly' 
throughout the period when he was responsible for the bid and decided 
not to order an investigation into whether he had breached the 
ministerial code of conduct.

Mr
Hunt also insisted there was no reason for him to quit - though he 
admitted in his evidence that he had considered resigning during his 
six-hour grilling a week ago.

Embarrassingly Downing Street was 
also forced to apply for core participant status in an emergency hearing
last month, allowing them to  inspect any relevant text messages or 
emails which have been submitted to the inquiry by other witnesses 
before giving evidence themselves.

Critics said it was a sign they were unprepared for the controversy that Leveson would cause for them.
