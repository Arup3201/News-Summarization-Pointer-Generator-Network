A decorated New York police officer was found intoxicated and nearly naked in a random woman’s apartment earlier this month only hours after receiving the department’s second-highest honor.

Four-year NYPD veteran Eugene Donnelly, 27, received the Police Combat Cross June 10 for bravery while off-duty during a shooting. He was then stripped of his gun and shield that evening.

Donnelly, stationed in a Bronx precinct near Fordham University, was so drunk he wandered into the stranger’s apartment wearing only his underwear, sources told the New York Daily News.

‘He was apparently drinking,’ a police source told the paper. ‘He was celebrating. He went to stay with a friend.’

The officer is believed to have been celebrating in the hours after shaking Mayor Bill de Blasio’s hand while receiving the award in a ceremony at City Hall.

Donnelly was staying at a friend’s apartment in Woodlawn, in the northern Bronx, when he somehow managed to leave the residence and ended up inside the woman’s apartment.

The woman lived in the same building, and police say she accused him of getting into a physical altercation with her, according to the Daily News.

‘He has an encounter with a female, and she claims he roughed her up,’ a police source said. ‘He was in his underwear when this happened.’

Melvin Hernandez, spokesman for the Bronx district attorney’s office, told the Daily News his office is looking into the matter. The Internal Affairs Bureau is also involved in the investigation.

Donnelly’s defense attorney shot down the claims in comments to the paper.

‘The case is in the beginning of the investigation,’ lawyer Stu London said. ‘When a thorough investigation has been completed, it will be obvious that my client engaged in no criminal wrongdoing.’

Donnelly was awarded the medal just over two years after he arrested a teen gunman terrorizing a Bronx neighborhood in May 2012.

He was off-duty while driving with a friend to meet his partner when several men ran from a park while being chased by a gun-wielding Javon Julien.

Julien, 19, fired a shot at the men while running past Donnelly’s car.

The cop shouted at Julien to stop, but the teen instead shot out Donnelly’s driver’s side mirror. The officer fired back, striking Julien four times before chasing down and arresting him.

Julien was given eight years in prison for his shooting spree.

The Bronx DA is still deciding whether to file charges against Donnelly.
