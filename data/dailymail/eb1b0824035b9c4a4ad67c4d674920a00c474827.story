At Parc des Princes on Saturday, Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrated his second-minute strike by peeling off his Paris Saint-Germain shirt to reveal the names of 50 of the people closest to his heart.

Carmen, Rahma, Antoine, Lida, Chheuy, Marki and others had been carefully (and temporarily) inked on to the forward’s torso as part of an initiative for the United Nations World Food Programme.

‘These are the people nobody cheers for,’ he announces in a moving video, set to the music of Jonsi’s soft-rock track Tornado, that has already attracted more than 1.1million YouTube views.

1 Left and right wrists: ‘Ibrahimovic Code’ - birthdates of his family. The right wrist shows when his father, older brother, younger brother and two sons were born.

2 Right arm: Arabic fonts: his father’s name ‘Sefik’ and son’s names ‘Maximilian’ and ‘Vincent’.

3 Left arm: Shows the birthdates of his mother and big sister. He used the right arm for the men as it is stronger, and the left arm for the women as it is closer to his heart.

4 Right stomach: Two playing cards — ace of hearts with the letter ‘H’ — believed to represent his fiancee Helena Seger. Ace of clubs represents spirituality (these cards are also considered good luck symbols).

5 Right side: Red dragon is a metaphor for his personality — in Japanese the dragon represents a warrior.

6 Left side: ‘Only God Can Judge Me’ – inset.

7 Chest and stomach: 50 names that represent the 805million starving people — the names include ‘Antoine’, ‘Omar’ and ‘Yovana’ — to raise awareness of suffering in accordance with the World Food Programme.

8 Left arm: Mother’s name ‘Jurka’

9 Left shoulder: Japanese koi — a carp that ‘swims against the current’, a symbol of masculinity.

10 Mid-upper back: Feather — origins in Native America, thought to be from an eagle and representing strength and courage.

11 Upper right back: Yant Prajao Khao Nirote — Buddhist for protection from suffering.

12 Right shoulder: Maori tribal symbol to protect himself and his family.

13 Lower left back: Leonardo Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man — his interpretation of, proportionally speaking, the perfect human form.

14 Mid-back: Buddhist ‘Five Deva Faces Yantra’ — represents the five elements.

‘These are the people nobody cheers for,’ he announces in a moving video, set to the music of Jonsi’s soft-rock track Tornado, that has already attracted more than 1.1million YouTube views.

He is shown sitting in the dressing room in quiet contemplation ahead of kick-off against Caen before he walks down the tunnel to be met by 45,571 supporters inside the stadium.

‘Whenever you see me you will see them,’ he adds as part of a campaign to highlight the 805m people around the world who are affected by hunger. ‘They are struck by war, by disaster and extreme poverty.’

For a footballer with Ibrahimovic’s profile, there was no better place to spread his message than the Parc des Princes just moments after he had scored against Caen.

‘When I took my shirt off against Caen, everybody asked what these new tattoos were,’ he revealed. ‘I had 50 removable tattoos on my body, they are the names of real people who are suffering from hunger in the world. While those tattoos have gone now, these people are still here... I hope you can see them through me.’

He was booked for the gesture, somewhat reluctantly, by referee Franck Schneider and will now miss PSG’s Ligue One clash with Monaco.

Tensions are running high in this team and although PSG coach Laurent Blanc respects Ibrahimovic’s humanitarian mission, there was a sting in the tail when he spoke on Monday.

Despite the sentiment the striker was booked for his celebration, as the laws of the game dictate

Ibrahimovic has scored twice in the Champions League this term, including one against old club Barcelona

Blanc said: ‘I knew about the project, but not the tattoos. I knew something was planned at the end of the game, but nothing more.

‘He scored early, he took off his shirt and was booked. It was good to promote the association, but it did cost us a yellow card. Imagine if he got another after 20 minutes? We may as well have abandoned the game in the 70th minute because we would have been down to seven men.

‘I don’t know whether him taking off his shirt was good for us. If he scores against Chelsea I hope he doesn’t take off his shirt because he will be booked again.’

Ibrahimovic’s goal against Caen, in a 2-2 draw, was a typical, improvised finish with an outstretched leg. 

The scoreline was not good, but Ibrahimovic’s goal was a nice way to warm up ahead of this evening’s first leg. Last season the legendary Sweden forward won the 11th league title of his incredible career and yet the Champions League has eluded him.

There was a period when the European Cup meant everything to him, the holy grail in a life that has taken him to Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, Milan and PSG. He says he will end his career here.

Off the field his influence continues to grow, to the point where he even felt able to alter the words to the national anthem, in a campaign for Volvo in collaboration with acclaimed Swedish songwriter Max Martin.

Ibrahimovic remains the driver of PSG, the main man in a team who have struggled to move into European football’s fast lane.

He played in PSG’s 3-1 victory here last season, a peripheral figure as goals from Ezequiel Lavezzi, an own goal by David Luiz and Javier Pastore’s 90th-minute strike sealed an impressive win. 

The forward, Sweden’s player of the year for the eighth successive year, was at Stamford Bridge for the second leg but missed the 2-0 defeat through injury.

His affection for Jose Mourinho developed during the season they spent together at Inter before Ibrahimovic left for Barcelona in 2009.

When these teams met in the quarter-final last season, Ibrahimovic accepted his chances to finally get his hands on the trophy could well have passed by.

Given his philanthropic gestures, it is clear his work for the United Nations means just as much to him.
