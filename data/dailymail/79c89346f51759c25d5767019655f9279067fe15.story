Cyclist Michael Matthews had to have six stitches in his hand after a crash on Tuesday, is wrapped up in bandages like an Egyptian mummy and yet is STILL contemplating making his Tour de France debut on Saturday.

The Australian, 23, suffered heavy bruising and a badly cut hand when he hit a piece of stone on a gravelly road during training on Tuesday, but was back on an exercise bike by Thursday morning.

Orica-GreenEDGE director Matt White admitted it was ‘not the ideal start to his first Tour de France’ for Matthews, a sprinter who wore the leader’s pink jersey during this year’s Giro d’Italia.

Bruised: Australian Michael Matthews still hopes to make his Tour de France debut despite having six stitches

Geared up: Yorkshire will host the Grand Depart of the Tour de France on Saturday

The Tour starts in Leeds on Saturday and finishes 2,276 miles later in Paris on July 27.

White said: ‘At the moment he will be at the start line but we are going to see how it goes.

‘He has hurt himself. He has (six) stitches in his hand. I can’t remember if it’s right or left, but it’s not an ideal start to your first Tour de France.

‘But he has put a lot of preparation in his first Tour and he is not going to let that preparation go to waste.’
