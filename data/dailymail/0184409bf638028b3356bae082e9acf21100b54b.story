She's more used to convincing others about her interest in world peace and environmental protection.

But this former Miss Great Britain is now pleading for something a lot simpler altogether - a willing housemate.

Stunning underwear model Sophie Gradon - who dated rugby star Danny Cipriani in 2013 - has taken out an advert to try and find the perfect would-be flatmate.

Could this be the UK's most attractive housemate? Former Miss Great Britain Sophie Gradon is looking for a new flatmate

The leggy 27-year-old from Newcastle is back on the property market after her current landlord decided to sell the property in which she lives

The leggy 27-year-old from Newcastle is back on the property market after her current landlord decided to sell the property in which she lives.

Now, she has written advert on the Spare Room website about the sort of person with whom she wants to live.

In the advert - entitled 'Girl about town' - Ms Gradon says she wants her future housemate to be no older than 35. 

And the model - who famously dumped Cipriani for being 'too boring' - makes clear that anyone who isn't sociable or fun need not apply.

She wrote: 'I'm extremely sociable and love nothing more than a good night out or drink in the house on a weekend with some chilled house music, candles & good vibes.

'I'm not a serious person, I like to laugh, a lot. I have zero tolerance for complainers or negativity!'

Ms Gradon, a marketing director, famously dumped rugby star Danny Cipriani after saying she 'got bored' with him

Ms Gradon had been dating the player for two months, after he split with model Kelly Brook, when she ended their relationship.

At the time, she said: 'I got bored of Danny and have now swapped him for someone incredible'.

In the advert- which is peppered with emoticons - Ms Gradon goes on to describe her perfect evening as cooking good meals, watching films and going to the gym.

The marketing director also says that anyone who is 'positive, considerate and knows how to have fun' would be a suitable match. She says she is looking to pay £600 all in for the room. 

But potential suitors should expect fireworks, too. In 2010, 65 years of pageant tradition was broken when Ms Gradon failed to pass on her Miss Great Britain crown at a ceremony in Somerset.

She had been banned from attending because of a row over her train fare.

If you are positive and considerate and know how to have fun then we'll get along just fine :-D

I work Mon to Fri for a digital marketing agency based at Hoults Yard. On weeknights I generally chill out. I (try to) go to gym, cook good meals / eat take out, watch movies (flick through netflix for an hour before giving up and watching some rubbish reality TV).

I'm extremely sociable and love nothing more than a good night out or drink in the house on a weekend with some chilled house music, candles & good vibes.

I'm not a serious person, i like to laugh, a lot.

I have zero tolerance for complainers or negativity!

Have to leave my current place because the landlord wants to sell :( and thats it really :)

Cheers!
