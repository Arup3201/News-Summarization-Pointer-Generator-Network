This is the moment the only female winchman in the RAF decided to risk her life - hanging by just a wire in a Force 8 gale - to save a fisherman.

Sergeant Rachael Robinson, 37, was repeatedly slammed against the deck of the boat for 30 minutes as she tried to reach the crew member whose head had been smashed open in the chaos.

She had already tried six times to lower herself from an RAF Sea King helicopter to reach the man as his condition rapidly deteriorated 50 nautical miles from Milford Haven.

Life-threatening: Sgt Rachel Robinson emerges from the Sea King helicopter 50 miles from the Welsh coast. Hanging from just a wire she now faces half an hour of severe battering against the vessel to reach the man

Honoured: Sergeant Rachael Robinson has been awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal in the latest Operational Honours for her part in the daring rescue that saved a fisherman's life in a force 8 gale off the Welsh coast

But, after several near-fatal slips, called a lifeboat to do the job.

When the lifeboat could not get anywhere near, Sgt Robinson decided to brave the horrendous conditions once more.

And now the Queen has recognised her 'exemplary act of bravery' on March 21 in a list of military honours.

Sgt Robinson, who worked with Prince William in the Falklands, was 19 when she joined the Force in 1995.

She is one of just 117 women to make the Royal list.

'It was like running into a wall,' she said, describing the smashes which left her repeatedly winded.

'We tried six times initially then decided we had been lucky and were chancing our arm.

Desperate: The lifeboat could not get close in the horrendous conditions, forcing Sgt Robinson to go it alone

Bravery: Flight Lieutenant Christian Wilkins, 28, had no reference points to judge how near or far they were

'We requested the lifeboat to take the casualty off and I would transfer him from the lifeboat because that would get him to hospital faster.

'But we got the call from the lifeboat saying they could not get to him either, so we tried a few more times.'

The horrendous gale conditions meant the helicopter's auto-hover and height hold systems did not work - and co-pilot Flight Lieutenant Christian Wilkins, 28, had no reference points to judge how far the aircraft was from the boat.

On her final attempt she battled for 15 minutes to get aboard.

After treating the casualty and getting 
him back on deck, he was successfully lifted to 
the helicopter and taken to hospital.

Flt Lt Wilkins, who was awarded the Air Force Cross for his part in the rescue, said: 'There was no question from her.

Queen's Awards: Sgt Robinson and Flt Lt Wilkins will receive their medals at Buckingham Palace later this year

'She was going out, she wanted to go out.

'She is completely fearless.'

Her citation for the Queen's Gallantry Medal reads: 'Robinson was frequently battered against the boat and although making contact with the foredeck each time, she was dragged off repeatedly by the severity of the boat movement.

'Despite the repeated impacts with the boat causing her great pain and the obvious dangers she faced of being severely injured or swept overboard, she never once gave up.

Lengthy service: Rachel joined the RAF aged 19 in 1995. She had five years out to train in Iraq

'Adrenalin junkie' Sgt Robinson, who worked with Prince William in the Falklands, adores her job

'Through sheer determination and grit, she battled through the violent conditions until she had successfully made it to the casualty.'

She has also received two more honours for the rescue - a commendation from the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society 
and the master medal from the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators.

Sgt Robinson, who has also worked in Iraq and as a police officer in Cheshire, hopes this will inspire other women into the job.

'There was one other woman but she left to become a doctor,' she said.

'I like helping people and I am a bit of an adrenalin junkie.

'It is such a brilliant job.'

The pair will receive their awards from the Queen at Buckingham Palace later this year.
