A Barclays manager has been jailed for stealing thousands of pounds from an elderly millionaire's account in the hope the customer would not notice the money was missing.

Shaikh Khan, who handled hundreds of Premier accounts for a London branch's wealthiest customers, stole £10,000 from Jack Mautner - described as 'particularly old and vulnerable' - who had over £1million in his Barclays account.

After taking the money, the 26-year-old manager tampered with Mr Mautner's account details to ensure he was not sent a statement and alerted to the missing cash.

Khan, who worked in a Barclays branch on Oxford Street, also stole a further £10,000 from another customer, Lilia Vasilieva, who did not regularly check her account.

The Old Bailey heard the scam was masterminded by Khan's friend Farah Mahmood, 26, and that the majority of the stolen cash was channeled through accounts belonging to Ali Bashir, another schoolfriend, also 26.

Khan, who had previous convictions for dishonesty, first accessed Ms Vasilieva's account using a colleague's ID on January 13 2011, and transferred £5,000 to Bashir's account. He recorded the transfer as a 'face to face' transaction.

He transferred another £5,000 on January 26.

Khan changed the address on the account so Ms Vasilieva did not receive her statements, the court heard.

Prosecutor Tim Devlin told the court Khan and a colleague visited Mr Mautner's home on January 26 to discuss a legitimate transfer of £50,000.

'Perhaps realising that Mr Mautner was very old, he decided to target a particularly old and vulnerable member of society,' he said.

'He must have seen how much was in that account and decided to have some of it for himself and his friends.'

The court heard Khan had lied on his CV in order to get his Barclays job.

A judge at the Old Bailey described the three friends' 'web of fraud' as an offence which 'strikes at the heart of the banking system and one in which wealthy, elderly and vulnerable customers were preyed upon'.

Khan, of Manor Park, east London, Mahmood, of East Ham, and Bashir, of Ealing, west London, had all denied conspiracy to steal between January 10, 2011, and February 25 2011, but were convicted by a jury.

Khan had claimed he was acting under duress after being threatened by Mahmood.

Judge Kramer said: 'This was a deliberately dishonest and targeted fraud.

'You, Mahmood, were at the centre of a web of fraud, arranging it and giving instructions to the others as to where the money should go.

'I am satisfied that you, Khan, abused your managerial position at that bank. You selected two accounts and withdrew £20,000.'

The judge said Khan knew one account was 'rarely checked', and that the other contained a seven figure sum meaning the missing money would be 'a drop in the ocean'.

Bashir's rolr was to act as a 'conduit' through whose account £15,000 of the stolen money was channeled, the judge added.

Khan and Mahmood were each jailed for 18 months.

Bashir was given a 12 month prison sentence suspended for two years.
