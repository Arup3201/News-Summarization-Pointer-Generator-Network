A Zumba fitness instructor who turned her Maine studio into a brothel was sentenced to 10 months in jail Friday, bringing to a close a high-profile prostitution scandal featuring sex videos, adultery, exhibitionism and more than 100 clients.

Alexis Wright was sentenced under a plea agreement to 20 counts including prostitution, conspiracy, tax evasion and theft by deception.

Justice Nancy Mills extended wishes for success after the sentence was imposed.

Infamous: Maine Zumba instructor Alexis Wright was sentenced to 10 months in jail and a $58,000 fine after pleading guilty to 20 counts, including prostitution, conspiracy, tax evasion and theft by deception

‘Based on what you have to say and what I know about you from your attorney, I know that you will succeed when you're released and that you will prevail. I wish you success,’ Mills said.

Wright's attorney said the defendant had a difficult childhood, witnessing domestic violence and suffering sexual abuse, before she met Mark Strong, her eventual business partner. She said Strong used her background to manipulate her.

Addressing the judge through tears, Wright said she felt relief when police raided her business on Feb. 12, 2012, because she wanted out. She said she intends to work when she's released to help other women in similar situations.

‘In my eyes I'm free. I free from this. And I have an incredible amount of strength that I knew was in me somewhere,’ she said. ‘Now that I have the strength I want to encourage others to come forward.

Do-gooder: Wright told the judge that upon her release from jail, she plans to work to help other women in similar situations

Victim: Wright's attorney told the judge that as a child, the Zumba teacher witnessed her mother suffering abuse at the hands of her father, who later weny on to molest her

‘I want them to know that there's at least one person out there who'll believe their story, no matter how crazy it seems.’

She then added: ‘It's my intention to stand up for what is right. When I'm out, I'm going to pursue helping people fight through situations that are similar to mine. I'm optimistic that something good will come out of this.’

Afterward, she was led from court to begin serving her sentence.

The 30-year-old Wright was accused of conspiring with an insurance business owner to run a prostitution business in which she videotaped clients without their knowledge and kept detailed records over an 18-month period indicating she made $150,000 tax-free.

She also collected more than $40,000 in public assistance.

According to a memo written by defense attorney Sarah Churchill and cited by the Bangor Daily News, Wright suffered severe childhood trauma in her 'formative years' after witnessing her mother being abused by her father, who later went on to molest her.

When Wright was 8 or 9 years old, her parents separated and she moved to Califnoria with her mother. however, her fatehr kidnapped her and took her on a cross-country trip to Maine. 

'I think we can all imagine the horrors that took place during that cross-country trip,' Churchill said.

The lawyer went on to say that the severe trauma caused by the sexual abuse left Wright vulnerable to manipulation at the hands of Strong, whom she met while working as an exotic dancer to pay her way through college.

Admission of guilt: Zumba instructor Alexis Wright appears with her attorney, Sarah Churchill, to plead guilty to 20 counts, including prostitution, theft and tax evasion

Putting on a show: Dressed to the nines and sporting heavy makeup and bright manicure, Wright quietly answered 'guilty' 20 times when the judge read the counts

The scandal in the seaside town of 
Kennebunk, known for its sea captain's mansions, beaches and New England
charm, became a sensation following reports that Wright had at least 
150 clients, some of them prominent.

So far, 66 people have been charged, including a former mayor, a high school hockey coach, a minister, a lawyer and a firefighter.

The
state will continue to pursue charges against additional people 
identified on Wright's ledger if the evidence is strong enough to prove 
the charges beyond reasonable doubt.

Wright
was originally charged with 106 counts. All the counts in the plea 
agreement were misdemeanors, including three counts relating to welfare 
and tax fraud that were reduced from felonies.

Under
the agreement, prosecutors will seek restitution of $57,280.54. 
Prosecutors say Wright cooperated with prosecutors and spared the state 
an expensive trial.

Her 
business partner, Strong, 57, of Thomaston, was convicted of 13 counts 
related to promotion of prostitution and was sentenced to 20 days in 
jail.

The married father of two, who has acknowledged having an affair with Wright, was originally charged with 59 counts.

It
came as little surprise that Wright opted to avoid standing trial by 
pleading guilty because evidence against her was overwhelming in 
Strong's trial, with jurors watching a video of her engaging in sex with
a client who left $250, which she pocketed.

Prosecutors say paid sex happened in her studio, apartment and an office, where tenants complained about moaning and groaning.

Electronic
evidence was plentiful because the two kept in touch via text, email 
and Skype, which Wright used to send a live video stream of sex acts to 
Strong. Videos also showed them speaking openly of ledgers, payments and
scheduling.

Explicit: Prosecutors played a video of Alexis Wright, 30, stripping off and teasing construction workers across the street from her exercise studio

For all to see: The video played for jurors shows Wright stripping out of her towel while standing in the window of her Pure Vida Zumba exercise studio in downtown Kennebunk, Maine

Not guilty: Mark Strong (right) admits he had an affair with Wright and his lawyers concede he may have watched video of her having sex with other men - but they argue he didn't know she was running an alleged prostitution business

Evidence 
unsealed after the trial indicated electronic exchanges in which Wright 
talked about the business goals: nine clients a week, 45 clients a 
month.

They also openly 
discussed scheduling, insurance payments, her sexy outfits and clients' 
preferences. She even appeared to seek advice from Strong after 
encountering an unhappy client.

Business was running smoothly before it came to an abrupt end.

‘I
feel like this is going to be a good week,’ Wright wrote to Strong two 
days before the arrival of detectives with search warrants on Feb. 14, 
2012.

Wright had attended college classes 
and ran dance classes for the local parks and recreation program before 
opening her studio in Kennebunk. But she was also engaging in paid-sex 
acts in the studio, in her apartment and in her office, law enforcement 
officials said.

Overseeing the operation and watching
the sex acts live on his office computer 100 miles up the coast was 
Strong, a married father of two who ran a successful insurance agency in
Thomaston.

Seductive: Mark Strong, a married father of two,
allegedly sat at his home computer and watched Alexis Wright have sex 
with several men via live-streaming video over Skype

It came as no 
surprise that Wright would seek a plea agreement because evidence 
presented in Strong's trial was so overwhelming. A video played for 
jurors showed Wright engaging in sex acts with a 61-year-old man who 
then inquired about her rate before leaving $250 cash on her massage 
table.

After the man left, the video showed Wright pocketing the money. Wright's business partner allegedly watched the sexual encounter from his home computer via Skype.

The damning evidence 
against Wright, recorded by Zumba instructor herself on a camera hidden 
in a nest of lingerie, shows her negotiating a fee and then collecting a
pile of cash after she finishes.

On trial: Strong has pleaded not guilty to 12 charges of promoting prostitution and one count of invasion of privacy

In between clients, she discusses her
schedule of clients with a man who is watching through the video 
camera. Prosecutors say that man is Strong, according to Seacoast Online.

'I'd like to schedule only two one-hour appointments tomorrow instead of 45,' Wright says, talking to the camera.

'Nice to get three in somehow,” the man's voice says.

When Wright says that she has 'school' the next day, the man suggests she 'fit three in today.'

Wright says that would be 'pushing it.'

The man's voice later asks which clients he should try to book for her.

The jury was also shown a video of the Zumba prostitute dropping her towel and posing naked in front of
the windows of her Maine exercise studio. She 
describes how she is trying to get the attention of construction workers
across the street a she stands in front of the windows of her business.

Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, is slated to stand trial in May. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges

Wright's alleged clients include wealthy and well-known figures in southern Maine. So far, 18 men have pleaded guilty to paying Wright for sex

'I’m going to try and get them to 
come over and have some fun,' she says as she stands on a chair in full 
view of downtown Kennebunk.

She drops her towel as she slowly tears a sign off the window.

'He’s taken notice. They’ve both taken notice. And now they’re watching.'

Later, she appears to unlock the door a let a man inside, according to Seacoast Online.
