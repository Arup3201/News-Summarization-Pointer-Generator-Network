The theme for the Easter Egg Roll at the White House was 'Let’s Go, Let’s Play, Let’s Move!', following the First Lady's campaign against obesity - and the Obamas threw themselves into the spirit of the day.

The Obamas welcomed thousands of children and their parents on to the South Lawn this morning.

The President said he was thrilled to 
have so many guests on a sunny Easter Monday in Washington D.C, while Mrs Obama said she 
hoped all visitors had comfortable shoes on to take part in activities.

Some 30,000 kids and their parents were expected at the White House event attended by the Obamas, their daughters Malia and Sasha and first grandmother Marian Robinson.

Michelle and daughters were perfectly attired for spring in bold, block colours.

The annual event, which dates back to 
1878 when Rutherford B Hayes was president, featured traditional 
egg-rolling races along with a yoga garden, obstacle courses, 
book-readings, musical performances, basketball and tennis.

After the National Anthem was performed 
by 14-year-old X Factor contestant Rachel Crow, the President helped 
some of the youngest guests with the egg and spoon race.

Obama blew the whistle and joined in the
cheers of parents as the children ran to the finish. 'We've got a 
winner over here,' Obama called out as the winner crossed the line.

He then joined the rest of his family on
the book-reading stage. Malia and Sasha took turns reading from A Sick 
Day for Amos McGee by Philip C. Stead.

Obama followed with Maurice Sendak's 
Where the Wild Things Are, which he called an 'all-time classic,' and 
encouraged his audience to join in the growling, roaring and 
teeth-gnashing of the characters. 

'You guys were excellent wild things,' he said, before excusing himself. 'I've got to go to work. I'm gnashing my teeth.'

Mrs. Obama kept to the animal theme by reading, The Little Mouse, The Red Ripe Strawberry, and the Big Hungry Bear by Don and Audrey Wood.

Also taking turns at the storybook corner were actors Julianne Moore and Forest Whitaker.

Other musical performers included Janelle Monae, Cody Simpson and the characters from Sesame Street.

The President found some time to
fit in his favourite sport of basketball. The balls being used were emblazoned with Obama's face and the U.S. flag.

According to Jake Tapper, ABC's senior White House correspondent, the basketballs were brought along by NBA stars taking part in the day's events - and not funded by taxpayer dollars.

On the court, the President played the game Shoot For 
Strength with a group of kids and the Harlem Globetrotters.

The contest involves sinking shots - 
and doing pushups. It took Obama eight tries to sink a basket. He then 
joined in the pushups that are the game's 'reward.'

'I'm all pushed-up-out!' he said afterwards.

Elsewhere,
children could take part in sports with tennis star Michael Chang, NBA 
standouts Mitch Richmond and Daryll Dawkins and Olympians Michelle Kwan 
and Dominique Dawes.

Celebrity
chefs were on hand to provide health-eating tips during cooking 
demonstrations.

Many children took the chance to dye hard-boiled eggs, 
leading to 14,500 being rolled down the hill.

Obama also managed to fit in a few minutes of tennis with professional player Chris Evert.

The event's theme was 'Let's Go, Let's Play, Let's Move,' encouraging physical activity as part of Mrs Obama's initiative to counter childhood obesity.
