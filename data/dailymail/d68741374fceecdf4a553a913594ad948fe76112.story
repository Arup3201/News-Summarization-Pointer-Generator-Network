A flagship scheme launched by David Cameron to get three million people texting or emailing their blood pressure and other vital signs to their GP surgery has been quietly dropped.

When the Prime Minister announced the initiative in 2011, he said ‘telehealth’ had been found to be a ‘huge success’ – and promised three million people would use it within five years.

He claimed it would save the NHS £1.2billion a year by keeping patients with long-term conditions like heart disease and diabetes out of hospital.

Ill health: Many older people were put off by David Cameron's modern 'telehealth' gizmos

Getting patients to monitor themselves – for example, taking blood pressure or blood sugar readings – and send the information remotely would make them take better care of their own health, Ministers believed.

And the NHS would save more money by not having to provide so many routine appointments. ‘This is going to make an extraordinary difference to people,’ Mr Cameron predicted. But now the ‘3millionlives’ project has been shelved, after subsequent research found NHS telehealth programmes to be expensive and largely ineffective.

Many older people were put off by having to use modern gizmos to send in their details, researchers found.

Nurses were enthusiastic, as the scheme cut their workload and ‘empowered’ patients to care for themselves. But doctors complained they were inundated by a ‘tsunami’ of patient data.

And last month, academics found the extra £1,014 a year it cost to provide each patient with the monitoring service and equipment did not cut deaths or rates of admission to care homes.

Last night, GPs said politicians should concentrate on getting the basics right, rather than obsessing about ‘gadgets’. Dr Margaret McCartney, who presents the BBC Radio 4 programme Inside Health, said: ‘This expensive black box kit isn’t good value for money – and there is no gadget in the world that can help a sick person to eat, wash and dress.

‘NHS England needs to invest in what works – especially hands-on human care supplied by carers who currently often don’t have enough time to supply people’s basic needs.’

But Professor James Barlow from Imperial College, London, who has helped evaluate the programmes, believes telehealth still has a future. He said: ‘The evidence is that telehealth does lead to lower rates of admission and speedier discharge.’

The 3millionlives initiative has now been rebranded, with NHS England officials referring to it as TECS (Technology Enabled Care Services), but with no ambitious targets attached.

Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, has written to health bosses asking them to support the revamped scheme.

Advocates of telehealth argue the popularity of smartphone health apps – which measure everything from sleep to fitness levels – make it more likely ‘remote care’ will become increasingly accepted.

A spokesman for NHS England claimed their ambition was still to help three million people with long-term conditions using remote care devices. He added: ‘Twenty years from now, we will use technology to access our health services as a matter of course.’
