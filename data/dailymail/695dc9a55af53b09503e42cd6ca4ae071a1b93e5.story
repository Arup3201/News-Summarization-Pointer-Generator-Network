An ex-banker wrote an op-ed Sunday lifting the lid on what he deems the 'wealth addiction' of stock brokers and bankers, which he claims still rages on post crash.

Sam Polk went from a drug addicted Columbia University student to a highly funded money addicted Bank of America trader.

Polk describes in his New York Times op-ed how in college, he used alcohol, cocaine, pot, Ritalin, ecstasy, and meaningless sex to fill his never satisfied soul. He confesses to getting suspended from Columbia for burglary and fired from a job at an internet company for fist fighting.

Sam Polk was addicted to drugs and alcohol, then wealth, and now his new addiction is raising money for families in need

Polk managed to lie his way into an internship with Credit Suisse and got a therapist to help him get sober--from drugs that is.

Finally Polk was able to flush drugs and alcohol from his system to allow a new drug in--money. He describes how he got his Job at Bank of America by making daily phone calls to the director. He says he was thrilled to not have to check his balance before withdrawing money for the first time in his life, but for Polk too much was never enough.

After Bank of America, he got a job at a hedge fund and was disappointed that he 'only made $1.5 million' his second year there, recounts New York Magazine.

He wrote that his therapist told him , 'I might be using money the same way I’d used drugs and alcohol — to make myself feel powerful — and that maybe it would benefit me to stop focusing on accumulating more and instead focus on healing my inner wound.'

He said that he began to agree with his therapist after seeing other bankers ferociously hating anyone who tried to regulate their bonuses.

'In the months before bonuses were handed out, the trading floor started to feel like a neighborhood in “The Wire” when the heroin runs out,' Polk wrote.

Whether it was partying with drugs or partying with money, Sam Polk needed more

Polk made the decision to quit the hedge fun after his boss refused to up his bonus from $3.6 million to $8 million.

That's when he went on to start a charity called Groceryship that helps poor families put food on their tables.

Before becoming a philanthropist he spent an entire year going through money 'withdrawal' and would wake up in the middle of the night worrying about not making enough even though he had plenty.

After some time, he was finally able to look at Wall Street and money in a new light.

'We all confront our part in enabling wealth addicts to exert so much influence over our country,' the culture of which currently 'supports and even lauds the addiction,' concludes Polk.

His op-ed suggests an idea that would make the world a more financially equal place.

'Let’s create a fund, where everyone agrees to put, say, 25 per cent of their annual bonuses into it, and we’ll use that to help some of the people who actually need the money that we’ve been so rabidly chasing. Together, maybe we can make a real contribution to the world,' he said.

In addition to using the New York Times as a forum, he jokes about wealth addiction on twitter.

'12-step programs only work when addicts hits bottom. How can wealth addicts hit bottom amidst such ingrained cultural support?' he said.

He also wrote, 'Everyone wants to win the lottery. Wealth addicts want to win it 2x, 3x, a 100x.'

Even though money is no longer on Polk's mind, his life appears to be more rich.
