Payday loan adverts will not be banned from children’s TV despite warnings lenders were ‘grooming’ youngsters to become the next generation of borrowers.

The government has rejected calls to stop promotions using catchy songs and puppets during programmes aimed at children.

Despite research showing adverts from firms offering high interest, short-term credit were watched almost 600million times by children last year, ministers said it was still a ‘relatively small’ problem.

Labour leader Ed Miliband called for the adverts to be banned while money expert Martin Lewis told MPs they amounted to ‘inappropriate propaganda’ which meant even the under-10s now nag their parents to borrow money to buy toys.

The Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee published a report calling for the adverts to be banned from children’s shows.

It said: ‘Research undertaken by Ofcom has shown that payday loan advertising is prevalent on daytime television and children's channels.

‘We do not believe that these are appropriate channels for payday loans. We recommend that payday loan adverts are banned from programming aimed at children.’

It was shown evidence that the average child aged between four and 15 was exposed to 70 payday loan adverts last year and was being persuaded that using such credit was ‘fun’ and ‘easy’.

The number of payday loan adverts hit almost 400,000 in 2012, up from just 17,000 in 2008

But in its official response to the report the government rejected the demand, and played down the scale of the problem.

‘The increase reported by Ofcom in the number of payday lending ads seen by children is concerning,’ it said.

‘But it is also important to note that they comprise a relatively small 0.6 per cent of TV ads seen by children aged four to 15.

‘The Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice (BCAP), the body that writes the Broadcast Advertising Code, is considering the extent to which payday loan advertising features on children's TV and whether there are any implications for the ASA's regulation of this sector.’

More than half of all payday loan adverts are seen during daytime TV, according to Ofcom

In November Mr
 Miliband called for the ads to banned during any programmes 
aimed at children. He said: 'As a father of two young boys, I know how 
influenced they can be by what they see.

'And I don't want payday lenders taking advantage of the cost of living crisis and targeting children in this country.

Money saving expert Martin Lewis accused payday lenders of using adverts to 'groom' the next generation of borrowers

'It
 is wrong, it is not what should be happening and that is why a Labour 
government would stop them advertising during children's TV.

'It's bad for young people, it's bad for families and it's bad for communities.'

At a hearing of the committee last 
year Mr Lewis, founder of the MoneySavingExpert.com website, called for a
 blanket ban on advertising designed to ‘normalise’ the idea of 
short-term loans among children.

He accused the firms of ‘grooming a new generation towards this type of borrowing’.

He
 told the committee: ‘If you think we have got problems now, you wait 
for 10 years’ time. Grooming is the right term. We are talking about a 
market that didn’t exist five years ago.’

He
 condemned the adverts as ‘deliberately contrived and controlled’, 
singling out Wonga’s adverts featuring puppets to appeal to children.

A survey on MoneySavingExpert.com found a third of parents reported their under-10s repeating payday lenders’ slogans, while 14 per cent said that when they had refused to buy a toy, their child had nagged them to take out a payday loan.

According to Ofcom, in 2009 there were just 17,000 payday loan adverts shown on UK television, recording 12million views or ‘impacts’ among adults and 3million 4-15-year-olds.

By 2012 the number of adverts had rocketed to 397,000, with 7.5billion impacts among adults and 596million for children.

It means that in a year every adult saw 152 payday loan adverts, and 4-15-year-olds watched the equivalent of 70 each.
