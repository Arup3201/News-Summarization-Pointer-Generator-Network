Two kayakers cling to each other's canoes as a giant 20-foot shark circles their boats on the hunt for its dinner.

The stunned pair were within touching distance of the sea monster as they enjoyed the summer sun just off shore at Sennen in Cornwall on Thursday afternoon.

The basking shark’s massive dorsal fin can be seen protruding around two feet from the water and dwarfs the kayaks bobbing beside it.

But this curious leviathan of the deep was less interested in the boaters as food and was more likely searching for its favourite dish, a hearty helping of plankton.

Fortunately although basking sharks are the second biggest fish in the sea they are plankton eaters and harmless to humans.

Photographer Rachel Hosken caught the astonishing scene and was astonished by the shark’s size.

'It was gigantic,' she said. 'There were four of them and that was the biggest.

'They were feeding not far from shore.

'There were a few kayakers nearby and the shark just passed them and didn’t seem bothered at all.

'The size of the fin gives a feel for the size of the shark - it was quite a sight.

'Unfortunatley a snorkel diver went in to have a closer look at the shark and it just swam away.'

Big fish: They can reach up to 36ft and weigh up to seven tons. They are the largest wild animal to regularly visit Britain

Reaching lengths of up to 36ft, basking sharks are the largest fish in British waters.

One of only three plankton-feeding shark species, these harmless giants reappear in British coastal waters each summer.

Their
presence is often marked by their large dorsal fin, though watchers are
often lucky enough to see baskers breach - jumping clear of the water.

The basking shark is the second largest of shark species, second only to the also 'vegetarian' whale shark.

The basking shark is so-called because it is most often 
observed when feeding at the surface, appearing to be basking in the warmer water.

It
doesn't suck up its food by pumping water through its gills - as the 
whale shark or the wonderfully named megamouth shark. Instead, it relies
only on water being pushed through its gills by 
swimming.
