The scoreline at Old Trafford flattered Manchester United as Louis van Gaal's side eventually prevailed 3-1 against Premier League strugglers Burnley.

Defender Chris Smalling scored a brace to show United's misfiring strikers how its done.

Despite winning United we booed by their own supporters as the Old Trafford fans appear increasingly frustrated by the football lacking ambition, invention and dominance under van Gaal. Sportsmail's Mike Keegan gives you the lowdown on how the players performed at Old Trafford.

MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-2-1-2)

David de Gea - 6.5

Powerless to prevent Ings header. Reaction save to keep United ahead at 2-1. Remains in top form.

Manchester United defender Phil Jones had to leave the field and be replaced early on with injury

Phil Jones - 5

Outmuscled by Keane early on in what could have been a costly error and came off injured before five minutes had elapsed.

Marcos Rojo - 6

Defensively United’s best player on a night the bar was set about half an inch off the floor. An island of calm in a red sea of madness.

Jonny Evans - 5

An uncomfortable night for the Northern Irishman. All over the shop and misguided header to give away a corner under no pressure summed it up.

Paddy McNair - 6

Full of energy going forward and stung Heaton's gloves from distance to win the corner that led to the opener. Struggled to deal with Kightly at times.

Daley Blind - 6

Like the kid in the playground who stays back while all his mates try and grab the glory before retiring with a nasty-looking cut.

Angel di Maria - 6.5

Guilty of giving possession away but laid Smalling’s second on a plate with an accurate cross and a menace with his pace on the break. Trickery too much for Arfield to win penalty. 

Wayne Rooney - 6

United fans had called for him to be moved forwards from his role on the right of the diamond but when Blind came off he went backwards to holding midfielder. Rightly carded for foul on the excellent Ings.

Adnan Januzaj - 6

Anonymous for long periods and seemed to try and take on one man too many. Neat shot easily held by Heaton but little joy for the tricky Belgian. 

Robin van Persie - 6

Could not combine effectively with Falcao in a one-paced top two before smashing home his penalty. The 90 minutes will be welcome but can do much better than this. 

Radamel Falcao - 5.5

Did well to nod back for Smalling to score but otherwise poor. Ball bounced off him more than once and left home support frustrated. Booked for what appeared to be a nasty elbow and hooked shortly after.

Subs

Chris Smalling (Jones 5) - 6

Headed United in front 22 seconds after replacing Jones and repeated the trick to save Van Gaal’s side from a half-time booing. Nowhere near Ings and defensively poor. Only a six because of the goals.

Ander Herrera (Blind 39) - 5.5

Involved in a terrible mx-up with Smalling and failed to offer the muscle United desperately needed in the middle of the park. Will be grateful to be noticed, regardless.

James Wilson (Falcao 74) - 6

On long enough to pick up a yellow. A coincidence United improved after his arrival? Hit side-netting late on.

BURNLEY (4-4-2) 

Tom Heaton - 6

Perhaps could have caught McNair’s shot which led to the corner from which malling scored his first but could do little about the second.

Kieran Trippier - 6.5

Ex-City man surged down the right before teeing up Ings to equalise with a pinpoint cross and was a threat coming forward with superb delivery.

Jason Shackell - 6

Coped well with the threat of Van Persie and Falcao and will wonder how he ended up on the losing side.

Ben Mee - 6

The ex-City man, born down the road in Sale, did well alongside Shackell but failed to get the result he would have craved. 

Michael Kightly - 6.5

Wasted a chance to level when he dallied too long on a one-on-one with De Gea. Booked for a trip on a breaking Di Maria but had little option and blasted a great chance to level wide late on before being subbed.

David Jones - 6.5

Strong presence in the heart of midfield and was everything United lacked as Burnley bossed the first half for long periods.

Clarets forward George Boyd was a constant menace for Manchester United to deal with at Old Trafford

George Boyd - 6

Another Clarets nuisance, his cross had Smalling and Herrera at sixes and sevens as Burnley pressed for an equaliser at the start of the second half.

Michael Keane - 6

Almost a dream return when he outmuscled Jones earlier on but nodded a corner wide in front of the Stretford End.Outjumped by Smalling for the first.

Scott Arfield - 6

Booked for a needless challenge on Herrera but a strong physical presence in a midfield battle the visitors often dominated. Outwitted by Di Maria for penalty.

Ashley Barnes - 6

Sidefooted Kightly’s looping pass wide at the end of a sweeping move. Combined well with Ings but tired in the second half before being replaced by Jutkiewicz.

English striker Danny Ings scored for Burnley and caused a host of problems for Manchester United

Danny Ings - 7.5

Ghosted in to head Burnley level. Caused plenty of problems early on and set Barnes only for his strike partner to blaze over. Looks the real deal, really does.

Subs

Sam Vokes (Kightly 86) - 5

The game was gone by the time he entered the fray.

Lukas Jutkiewicz (Barnes 90 +1) - 5

Three-minute cameo not long enough to make an impact.
