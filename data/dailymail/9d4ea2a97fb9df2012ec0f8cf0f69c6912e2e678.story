A 560-pound sex offender who was convicted of rape is livid with the medical center he is staying at free of charge over their food offerings.

Kenneth Harvey, 58, lives at the Peninsula Center for Extended Care and Rehabilitation in Queens, New York, and is hoping a lawyer will help him sue over the horrible food and bad bed he has been provided with, among other things.

Harvey, who was convicted of first-degree attempted rape in 1994, does not pay for his stay at the center, with taxpayers picking up the bill.

Big pain: Kenneth Harvey (above) is 58, weighs 560 pounds and wants to sure the medical center he stays at for free over poor food options

Making waves: Harvey used to own an escort service he says, and was convicted of first-degree attempted rape in 1994

He also used to own an escort service.

'My body is literally bending the mattress like an accordion,' Harvey told the New York Post about his private room, which costs Medicaid and Social Security up to $10,000 a month.

He then claimed that the facility offered nothing in the way of food, giving him just lettuce, tomato and two pieces of bread for lunch each day.

He also says he is being verbally abused and that he is forced to wait hours to receive his medication.

Harvey is only responsible for $800 a month to stay at the center, which all comes out of his Social Security check.

So far he has been unsuccessful in getting a lawyer to help him sue, but apparently the facility did set up a bigger bed for him last Friday. 

Harvey, who used to weight 700 pounds, lost his Brooklyn apartment in 2013 after a fire, and was forced to pan handle he claims before getting a bed at the medical center.

He says he is suffering from 'depression.' 

In a recent interview with Nancy Grace, the talk show host asked Harvey, 'Why don't you get a job? Then you could afford more food and a bigger bed.'

The center, largely funded through taxpayer money, does not provide him with enough food or a good enough bed he claims
