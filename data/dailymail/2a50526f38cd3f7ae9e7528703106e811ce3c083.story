BBC radio presenter Richard Bacon has revealed he was targeted by an abusive internet troll for nearly two years after he replaced Simon Mayo on BBC Radio Five Live.

The anonymous online abuse was directed not only at him, but also his wife and baby son and became so hateful, he was forced to report the suspect to the police.

The 36-year-old has spoken out in a documentary about cyber bullying due to be shown tonight, despite fearing this will provide further ammunition for internet trolls.

Concern: BBC radio presenter Richard Bacon has revealed he was targeted by an abusive internet troll for nearly two years

The rise of internet trolls - the name for people who offend and bait others on the web - has significantly risen with the development of social networks which people feel give them a place to insult other internet users without real-life repercussions.

Bacon said the abuse began when he replaced Simon Mayo on the radio show and the man voiced his dislike of the new programme on Twitter.

But then it started to take on a more sinister tone when the troll started to mention the former Blue Peter presenter's wife Rebecca McFarlane and the couple's five-month-old son Arthur.

In a BBC article Bacon explained 'This fella was fantasising about my death, daydreaming about me dying in a plane crash, and expressing his hope that my body would be mangled in a car wreck.'

'Not content with just repeating how much he hated me on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis, he started posting links full of abuse to my wife, mother and work colleagues.'

In the BBC 3 documentary, The Anti-Social Network, Bacon tried to track down his abuser and also met bereaved relatives left distraught after they were preyed on by 'RIP Trolls' posting offensive messages on tribute sites.

The suspect is a man in his forties and during the three months the documentary was being made, the man posted 255 abusive Tweets.

Bacon originally wanted to try to meet the troll who was targeting him, but had been advised to take it to the police.

'I wanted to know how a dislike of a radio station could go to contacting my family and tweeting about my baby,' he said.

'But the advice I got from a psychologist
and a police officer was to make an official complaint, so I'm in the 
process right now of making a complaint to the police.'

In an article for the Sun on Sunday, the radio presenter described how the internet abuse spread.

'A few years ago, he began a blog called
‘Richard Bacon is a ****’. He then went on Twitter and, using as his 
wallpaper a photograph of me when I had been assaulted a few years ago, 
he began tweeting abuse to me, my family and work colleagues.

'As a broadcaster, a bit of abuse comes with the territory, and in no way am I comparing what I was exposed to with the shocking levels of abuse directed at the grieving families I met.

'But when the abuse started to escalate, I felt he had crossed a line,' he wrote in the newspaper.

His partner  Rebecca McFarlane tried to reason with the troll on Twitter, but the abuse escalated and IT experts were called in to help piece together the identity of the suspected troll using clues from his online activity.

During the programme Bacon met families who had been targeted by trolls, in cases he said were far more distressing than what he had been through.

'What I have been through isn't that bad really, it's been distressing for my family but personally as a broadcaster it's something I know how to deal with.

'What's really heartbreaking is the parents and families of people who have killed themselves.'

He met the parents of Tom Mullaney, 15, from Bournville, Birmingham, who apparently killed himself after being bullied online.

A tribute site for him was hit by trolls, leaving vulgar messages that were seen by his family and friends.

'They see these nice tributes then they also see these weird sexual, violent comment and imagery,' he said.

'For people who don't even understand Facebook in the first place, as well as being upsetting and prolonging their grief, it's confusing.'

During the documentary, he also met a self-appointed 'troll hunter', who tries to track the people down and expose them.

'What he does is he works out who they are then posts letters to their neighbours saying, 'do you know your neighbour is doing this?'

In the documentary Bacon 
tracked down Colm Coss, who was jailed for posting 
obscene messages on sites in memory of dead people, including 
Big Brother star Jade Goody and tribute site to John Paul Massey, a 
Liverpool boy mauled to death by a dog

He said the 'troll hunter' told him perpetrators had started hacking other people's accounts and sending offensive messages from their identities, which could lead to retaliation.

'Imagine if you're the brother of the person who has killed themselves and you see the name and picture of a person you think is doing it, some people might react with violence.

'The troll thing is in an abstract world, but increasingly what they do is crossing over into the real world.'

In the documentary Bacon also tracks down Colm Coss, who was jailed for 18 weeks in October 2010 for posting obscene messages on Facebook sites in memory of dead people, including Big Brother star Jade Goody and tribute site to John Paul Massey, a Liverpool boy mauled to death by a dog.

Bacon said he hoped to alert people to the growing problem and how to stop it: 'I met two in the show, they are quite intelligent, meek and mild people and some have quite respectable jobs.

'Their power and the thrills they get all come from their anonymity.'

He said he thought some trolls saw themselves as 'brave', and making dangerous 'jokes', but added:

'But what they are doing is targeting individuals.

'They know their fellow trolls are watching. You can abuse someone in front of an audience and that's why in the end all it is is bullying.

'Some of these trolls will themselves be deserving of sympathy but that doesn't mean we shouldn't tackle them.

'It's time to stand up to them, it's time to either expose them or if you're a victim go to the police.'

The Anti-Social Network airs tonight at 9pm on BBC Three.
