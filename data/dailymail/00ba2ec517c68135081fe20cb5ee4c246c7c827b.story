Just in time for the holidays, a Louisiana judge ruled on Thursday that a woman had a
right to offer her neighbors an unusual seasons greeting by hanging Christmas
lights on her house shaped like a middle finger.

Sarah Childs was in a dispute with some of her neighbors in
Denham Springs, just east of Baton Rouge, so she decided to send a message with
her decorations.

Neighbors complained and police threatened to arrest her,
so she teamed up with the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana and sued
the city.

Christmas may be over, but Sarah Henderson wants to continue with her 'rude' lighting display to get her own back a neighbor

Henderson now says the display was a message to a neighbor who she believes stole her dog

‘I imagine it will be back up before too long,’ ACLU of
Louisiana executive director Marjorie Esman said of the display.

Childs put up the lights on her roof last month. She has
removed them twice since - once after a police officer told her she could be
fined and again after another officer threatened to arrest her, her lawsuit
said.

U.S. District Judge James Brady issued an order temporarily
barring city officials from interfering with the display. The two-page order
said the city's ‘continued efforts’ to prevent Childs from displaying her
holiday lights will violate her rights to free speech and due process.

Denham Springs attorney Paeton Burkett said the city will
comply with Brady's order, but she declined to comment on the lawsuit.

‘We're going to sit down with everybody involved and see if
there's any merit to it,’ she said.

Mayor Jimmy Durbin and Police Chief Scott Jones, who are
named as defendants, didn't immediately respond to calls seeking comment.

The suit said the police department dispatched an officer
to Childs' home after several neighbors complained directly to the mayor.

The officer told Childs she would be violating the city's ‘obscenity
statute" and could be fined if she didn't take it down, according to the
lawsuit. However, Denham Springs doesn't have an obscenity statute, the suit
said.

Childs removed the lights but put them back up after the
ACLU defended her in an open letter to the city. That time, the display showed
two hands with extended middle fingers.

After another round of complaints, the city responded with
a ‘collateral attack,’ issuing her two tickets, according to the suit. One
accused her of obstructing the flow of traffic as she walked down the side of a
street.

Another ticket accused her of disturbing the peace while
singing an impromptu song about her neighborhood dispute while standing in her
driveway.

Henderson has twice removed the lights from her roof, but with the support of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana she is attempting to sue the city, its mayor and police

‘Childs' impromptu song allegedly contained some
obscenities directed at her neighbors, so the city cited her for simple
assault,’ the suit said.

The lawsuit filed 
suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana in 
Baton Rouge seeks an injunction, damages and attorney's fees.

The ACLU would not say exactly what the neighborhood
dispute was about, and a no one answered at a telephone listing for Childs.

'This is a victory
 for the First Amendment and the rule of law,' said Margorie Esman, 
executive director for the ACLU of Louisiana.

A hearing on Childs’ request for a preliminary injunction will be held on January 7.

Childs, a mother of four 
children aged between 4 and 16,  admits she deliberately fashioned her 
light display to look like a human hand ‘flipping the bird’. 

She said the middle finger salute was a message to some of her neighbors 
whom she has been involved in a year-long dispute with.

'They put themselves into affairs of 
mine that they had no business in,’ she told WBRZ. ‘They spread vicious 
lies throughout the neighborhood.’

Henderson had initially agreed to 
remove the offending display after she received a visit from Denham 
Spring Police. Corporal Shawn Perkins informed Henderson that her 
display was in violation of obscenity laws and that she faced the 
possibility of a $300 or $400 fine.

Traditional display: Henderson's neighbor Gemma Rachel said Christmas lights should be something wholesome for children to enjoy

Childs said she could have fought the request, but she decided to take the lights down out of respect for her mayor and city council.

One
 local neighbor, Gemma Rachel told WBRZ that while she hasn't have 
anything personal against Childs, she didn’t think the lights were an 
appropriate symbol for young children to be exposed to.

‘Christmas lights should be something for kids to enjoy’ she told WBRZ.

Since taking down her lights, Childs has received support from the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana.

Marjorie Essman, executive director 
at the ACLU, has sent a letter to the Denham Springs chief of police 
saying the city has no right to restrict Childs' expression purely because it, or Childs' neighbors, finds it vulgar or offensive.

In the letter, Esman wrote: 'The 
Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeal, which presides over Louisiana, Texas
 and Mississippi, has specifically commented on the protected expressive
 nature of a middle finger extended in defiance or protest: "The thumbed
 nose, the projected middle finger, the Bronx cheer, the grimace and the
 smile are all conduct intended to convey a message that is sometimes 
made even more expressive by its bold freedom from a garb of words." 
Davis v. Williams.'
