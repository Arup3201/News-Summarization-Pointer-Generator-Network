Pittsburgh has had such a cold summer that the trees are already changing color for fall.

Western Pennsylvania saw weather as cold as 48 degrees on Friday and the trees are beginning to turn red and brown ahead of season.

CBS reports that Pittsburgh holds the record for the tenth coldest summer since 1971 when weather experts began keeping track.

'This is extraordinary for August, and certainly is a reflection of the prevalence of cool weather,' KDKA Meteorologist Dennis Bowman said.

The Polar Vortex in January paved the way for cold temperatures in July.

Pittsburgh resident Marlene Evans told reporters that red and yellow leaves are already blending in among the green leaves on Water Street.

Weather.com reports that temperatures dropped as low as 48 degrees in Pittsburgh this month.

The weather has not once risen above 90 degrees.

'It has been a curious summer,' said Lee Hendricks, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

'The most curious thing is we haven’t had any 90-degree days.'

'It seems kind of strange to us,' Mr. Hendricks said.

However, this is not the coldest winter Pittsburgh has seen. In 1976 the average temperature for June, July and August was 67 degrees. This summer's average was 69.1 degrees.
