Aleksander Owens-Thurston died after crashing into a snow machine while skiing in the Austrian Alps, an inquest has heard

A university graduate died in the Alps when he crashed into a snow machine while not wearing a skiing helmet, a coroner has heard.

Aleksander Owens-Thurston, 23, of Surrey, was killed in February this year, just weeks after Michael Schumacher was placed into a medically-induced coma following a similar accident.

A coroner has now called for safety improvements at an Austrian ski resort and urged Britons heading off on skiing holidays this winter to wear helmets.

Mr Owens-Thurston lost control on a steep run in St Anton during the first day of a holiday with his parents, younger brother and godfather.

The IT worker - who was an experienced skier - fractured his skull when he collided with the 15ft long boom arm of a snow machine while skiing on a black run.

His inquest in Taunton heard that the boom arm was left across the ski run and was not padded, although the machine and its pedestal were.

Recording a verdict of accidental death today, West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose urged further safety precautions.

He said: 'This is a tragic matter. These snow making machines are increasingly used, and I suspect this year more than ever, as resorts try and have a full season and cannot afford to lose customers if there is not adequate amounts of snow.

'One finds snow making machines at many modern resorts across Europe. It seems to me that the marking of this snow making machine was probably inadequate.Â 

'Witnesses referred to other resorts where they have bright, luminous tape and certainly a warning.I also note that the pedestal and the machine itself were padded but not the boom.

'Sadly, I think Aleksander did not appreciate the difficulties he was facing coming down the slope.

'What I think happened is that for some reason he fell or lost control, probably coming down onto the blue run, and as a result he hit the boom with enormous force.

He added: 'His father, who was not present, said he was probably flying through the air.

'Whether padding on the boom would have assisted... it certainly might have helped. Also I do urge everyone these days to wear helmets.

'One reads and hears of many cases where people's lives are saved. Sadly he died very shortly after the incident.'

Mr Rose said that he would be writing to the Ski Club of Great Britain highlighting his concerns and depending on its response, he would consider raising the matter directly with the Austrian authorities.

'Certainly there should have been padding on the boom. I am very unhappy about the position of snow making machines and I think that the primary cause of this accident,' the coroner said.

The accident happened at the skiing resort of St Anton, Austria, where the 23-year-old was on holiday with his parents, younger brother and godfather in February this year

Mr Rose concluded: 'If the boom had been pointing to the side of the ski slope I doubt I would be sitting here today for this very tragic incident.'

Paul Swateridge told the inquest that he saw Mr Owens-Thurston set off in front of him on the slope but did not see the collision.

Mr Swateridge, from Taunton, who is Mr Owens-Thurston's godfather, said he did not learn of the tragedy until he returned to his hotel later that day.

'The skiing conditions were perfect, the weather was perfect and there was not a cloud in the sky,' he said.

'Aleksander was not wearing a helmet. It was really, really hot, around zero degrees, which doesn't seem a lot but when you are in Austria it's hot.

'The boom was across the slope, rather than down the slope. It was the way they left it - it presented a 15ft target to hit.

'Going back the following day it looked to me a little bit negligent to leave it in that position - in my mind it was negligent.'

Mr Owens-Thurston had recently graduated from the University of Surrey with a degree in economics and had started a job at an IT firm.

His family, who have since moved to Zurich, were not present at the hearing.

Speaking after his death, his father Phillip said he wanted changes to be made to prevent any similar accidents.

'There's an element of risk [in skiing] but what I have said is that it shouldn't be any more risky than it needs to be,' he told Get Surrey.

'If you stick a 15ft-long steel bar across a slope in a position, if someone comes down at speed and loses control they will be thrown into it at 50mph, that's not helpful.

'It's a tragic accident but what they have to do is think about the placement of the obstacles on the ski slopes, especially on black slopes where if you lose control it's going to be at speed.'

In December 2013, just over a month before Mr Owens-Thurston's accident, Michael Schumacher was seriously injured in an accident at Meribel in the French Alps.

The racing driver was wearing a helmet, which shattered due to the force of the impact when he fell onto a partially-covered rock.

After months in a coma, the seven-time F1 champion  is now said to be paralysed and in a wheelchair, cannot speak and has memory problems.
