It's school, but not as most schoolchildren know it.

These Chinese children are trainees at the Fei Yan Acrobatics Troupe, and dream of performing around the world.

With lessons from morning til night, and only an hour and a half off a day, their rigorous training will ensure that those who achieve their dream will be the best they can be.

The children training for the Fei Yan Acrobatics Troupe in China's Hunan Province spends hours each day practising contortion

Only the best and most dedicated children will make it through to become members of the independent troupe

Training for the troupe is free for talented children, and those who make it will receive a contract to perform and a monthly wage.

The acrobats, based in Changsha, in southern China's Hunan Province, are run by 76-year-old troupe leader Han Keting, a former acrobat who performed for Chairman Mao.

He runs a tight ship.Â  Earlier this year, the leader dismissed two children because he decided they weren't training as hard as the others.

'They could set bad examples,' he said.

The troupe's young members, who live together in a dormitory, train each day from 8.10am to 11.30am, and from 2pm-5.30pm.

Their schedule is pinned on a board in front of the training house and includes body contortion, handstand, skate rolling, kung fu, stairs, and many others.

The children at the acrobatic school practise the same stunts over and over again until they are perfected

With every tendon tightly controlled, and jaws clenched with effort, two female students practise holding a handstand

As part of their training the children perform the same actions over and over again until they are perfected.

Each month the difficulty level is then raised and they learn a new set of even tougher stunts.

One such stunt is called the Boneless Girl, and involves the acrobat placing her chin on the floor and curling her body up behind her with her feet placed on the floor in front of her face.

Mr Keting said: 'Most kids started training from eight years old, and as an acrobat they only have five years of golden time, from 16 to 20.

With their neck and their jaw taking all of their body weight, it is obvious why such rigorous training is necessary

The troupe was set up by former acrobat Han Keting, 76, who once performed in front of Chairman Mao

The trainee acrobats live together in dormitories and dream of winning a paid contract with the respected troupe

Utmost dedication is required of the pupils - earlier this year two children were dismissed for not training hard enough

Each month the difficulty level is raised and the young students start to learn a new set of even tougher stunts

'After 20 years old, their skills are becoming rusty and body is becoming stiff'.

Mr Keting performed on stage for more than 40 years, and after retiring from a provincial state-owned acrobatics troupe, he established his own.

He said: 'No one can perform my programme anymore, as it takes years of extremely hard training.'

The respected troupe leader now has connections around the world and has taken his troupe to perform in countries including Britain, the United States, Germany, Mexico and Thailand.

China's long-established Fei Yan Acrobatics Troupe is well respected and performs all over the world

Learning to be an acrobat requires complete dedication, and the students train from 8.10am until 5.30pm

The patched shoes reflect the fact that money is tight for the students, but they will earn a monthly wage

Living and training at such close quarters, the students develop tight friendships with each other
