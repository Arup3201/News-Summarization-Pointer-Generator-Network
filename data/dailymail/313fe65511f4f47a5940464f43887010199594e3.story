Thick and heavy cloud has killed-off the best views of Wednesday night's rare lunar eclipse as the highly anticipated event fizzled out in skies over Australia.

The blood moon event, which  astronomers were promising would make for spectacular viewing, failed to live up to to the hype many were hoping as a band of high cloud blocked the best views.

Despite the disappointment,  hundreds gathered at spots across the city hoping for a glimpse of the burgundy sphere.

About 200 people  gathered around Sydney to watch the event unfold 

About 200 people were at observatory hill, next to the Harbour Bridge, while about 50 gathered under the northern side of the central Sydney landmark. 

Professional and amateur photographers were about with lenses of all sizes, but their chances of snapping a clear shot of the event are slim due to thick, heavy low cloud.

'That doesn't help anyone see through it,' a Bureau of Meteorology spokesman told AAP.

'Ironically (Thursday) night is probably a much better night for viewing the sky, which tends to happen with these things sometimes.'

At about 10pm a dull, dark beige moon briefly appeared, prompting members of the crowd to reach for their cameras.

For those prepared to travel, the best spot to see the eclipse was the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, or further west.

Astronomer Alan Duffy of Melbourne's Swinburne University of Technology says a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth moves between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow across the moon that causes it to turn a blood red colour.

A lot of the country's east coast is affected by the cloud, but with a lunar eclipse happening at least twice a year stargazers shouldn't have to wait long for another chance to observe the phenomenon.

And it's expected that seven will occur in 2038.

West Australians will see the total eclipse, but will miss the entire passage of the earth's shadow across the face of the moon because the eclipse begins before the moon rises over the state.

The eclipse is the second of four total lunar eclipses, starting with a first 'blood moon' on April 15, in a series astronomers call a tetrad.

A senior lecturer at Queensland University of Technology explained: 'A blood Moon occurs when the orbit of the Moon is nearly perfectly aligned with the orbit of the Earth around the Sun.

'The simultaneous occurrence of all sunsets and sunrises on the rim of the Earth, make the Moon red.'

With a small pair of binoculars people will also be able to spot Uranus about 'two moon widths away' from the the blood moon. 

The eclipse will happen two more times over the next two years as part of this cycle, on April 4 and September 28, 2015. The next Tetrad cycle won't occur until 2032.

'If we were on the moon during this eclipse, we would see a bright orange-red ring in the sky where the Earth should be. The light from that bright ring bathes the moon in a reddish glow, which we can see from Earth.' Dr Hughes explained.

A blood moon occurs when the moon passes in to the shadow of Earth called the umbra

It is described as the 'simultaneous occurrence of all sunsets and sunrises'

Some Christians are concerned that the celestial event could mark the start of terrible events, based on a passage from the Bible that says: 'The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord comes.'

In 1493, the first Tetrad saw the expulsion of Jews by the Catholic Spanish Inquisition.

The second happened in 1949, right after the State of Israel was founded and the most recent one - in 1967 - happened during the Six-Day War between Arabs and Israelis.

John Hagee, a Christian pastor who has written a book on the Tetrad called 'Four Blood Moons: Something is About to Change' told the Daily Express that the first of the blood moons in 2014 took place right in the middle of the Jewish holiday of Passover.

Dr Hughes said that 'anywhere down the East Coast' is the best place to view it

The second, on October 8, occurs during the Feast of the Tabernacle and the third will be on April 4, 2015, also during Passover.

The final one happens on September 28, 2015, which is also during the Feast of the Tabernacles. 

A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet.

The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red.

This gives rise to its 'blood red' appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic.

When the moon first enters the Earth's partial shadow, know as the penumbra, a dark shadow begins to creep across the moon.

This gives the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks.

At the eclipse's peak, the moon enters the Earth's full shadow; the umbra.

At this stage, the Earth's atmosphere scatters the sun's red visible light; the same process that turns the sky red at sunset.

As a result, the red light reflects off the moon's surface, casting a reddish rust hue over it.
