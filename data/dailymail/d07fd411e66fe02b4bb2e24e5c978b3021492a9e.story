Sportsmail asked Tottenham fans' blog the Spurs Web to reveal the mood following the news the club might have to play at a neutral ground for a year before the new stadium is ready. Mick Faldo discusses what that means for the club. 

Since Spurs first announced plans in 2007/08, progress to a replacement for White Hart Lane has been made at the speed of a Vedran Corluka pirouette. 

Ever since its inception it has appeared that every forward step with the Northumberland Development Project  has been shortly followed by two backward ones.

If all had gone to the original plan we’d already have seen the team play in the completed ground –August 2014 was the target completion date. As it is, the only sign that the D in NDP doesn’t stand for ‘Demolition’ is the new Technical College in Northumberland Park (the thoroughfare, not the green space with slides and swings).

In the original plans, the Northumberland Development Project was due to be completed by August 2014

To those of us keen to see us give ourselves the best chance possible of matching the financial clout of the Premier League’s big spenders the announcement on Wednesday that we’re going to have to spend a season away from White Hart Lane is not as disappointing as it might first appear.

This is for two reasons. Firstly, we suspected this scenario would be the case for a while now. Secondly, it’s a sign of progress. 

Not as much of a sign as seeing Pochettino in a hard hat laying the foundation stone of the new ground, but it’s proof there is a plan - even if that plan isn't being fully adhered to.

Tottenham will move from White Hart Lane in an effort to compete financially with the big European clubs

Rumours that the unlovable Davids in charge at West Ham had refused Spurs permission to use the freshly vacated Upton Park for a season was the first time I personally got wind that we might be looking to up sticks whilst the bulldozers moved in to N17. 

I wonder if we offered to try the Olympic Stadium out for size for them for a season instead?

So, if it’s not east London, where is it to be? Brighton, Ipswich and Wembley have all been mentioned but Stadium MK, home of the MK Dons has been a constant. 

Daniel Levy could consider moves to Wembley, Portman Road, Falmer Stadium or Stadium MK

A move there would set few pulses racing but the relative ease of transport from north London and a potential 32,000 capacity would tick a couple of Levy’s big boxes. An option to play the bigger games at Wembley might be a sop to those 3-4,000 who’d get squeezed out by the capacity reduction. 

I wonder if we could get an agreement to play all of our evening games away from home to help avoid late night long distance travel for the home fans?

Let’s step into Poch’s tango shoes for a moment. He’ll hopefully have agreed a long-term plan with Levy (nope, I’ve not been sniffing anything) which will, by the time we need to move, see us jousting with the best of Europe on a regular basis. 

Perhaps he’d like to host those clubs who’ve limbo-ed under the Financial Fairplay rules in front of a smaller in-your-face crowd rather than the atmosphere-free Wembley? It could all end up being to our advantage. Just a thought.
