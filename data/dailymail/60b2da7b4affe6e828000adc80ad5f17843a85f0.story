Earl Attlee defended the level of train fares in the UK, before admitting they were 'just too expensive' and had forced him to cancel days out

A transport minister today claimed that he had been priced off the railways by sky-high fares.

In a frank admission for someone accountable for rail policy, Earl Attlee declared that ticket prices ‘too expensive for me’, and have even forced him to cancel a day trip to a motor show.

The 56-year-old Tory hereditary peer, who earns £63,537 as a spokesman in the House of Lords, said he ‘could not afford’ the prices charged for on-the-day tickets.

And he admitted the complex web of different ticket types was baffling, telling peers: 'It must be difficult for ordinary passengers to understand how ticket pricing works.'

Less than half of Britain's rail passengers think the railways are value for money, according to a survey this week.

At the start of the year passengers were hit with average price rises of nearly 4 per cent.

Today Lord Attlee said he had to scrap a planned trip to a motor show at the NEC in Birmingham because he could not afford the fare.

He made the admission after being challenged in the Lords about the level of fares.

The peer said a recent survey by Passenger Focus had reviewed UK rail fares and although the ‘overall picture was mixed’ the country compared favourably with other European countries ‘in respect of many ticket types particularly on longer distance tickets purchased in advance’.

But Labour's Lord Campbell-Savours told him: ‘Tickets on the day of travel are invariably far more expensive that advanced travel tickets.’

Average fares rose by 4 per cent at the start of the year but campaigners say that since the beginning of the recession costs have risen faster than average wages

John Richard Attlee is a Conservative hereditary peer who happens to be the grandson of a Labour Prime Minister.

Clement Attlee, who served in Churchill's war cabinet, was PM from 1945-51 and oversaw the creation of the National Health Service.

John Attlee, the 3rd Earl, attended the private Stowe School where other alumni include the actor David Niven, the jazz musician George Melly and Prince Harry's Chelsy Davy.

After a career in the vehicle repair industry, he entered the House of Lords in 1992 after the death of his father.

He started as a non-political crossbencher but joined the Tory party in 1997.

He has been a frontbench spokesman on several topics.

His cousin Richard Attlee plays Kenton in radio soap The Archers.

Lord Atlee, who is the grandson of 
Labour prime minister Clement Attlee, replied confessed that he had 
abandoned journeys after discovering what rail firms were charging.

He
said: ‘When we look at just walking up to Euston and buying a ticket, 
it is very expensive and we don't compare well with our continental 
partners.

‘But when we look at advanced purchases we do compare quite well.

‘In my case, one day I wanted to go to the NEC to visit the motor show and I could not afford the walk-up fare. Just too expensive for me.’

He also grumbled that train firms have 'difficulty' policing quiet carriages.

'I like a quiet carriage, but some people do not adhere to the rules,' he said.

Regulated fares, which include season tickets, increased by an average of 4.2 per cent, with the overall average rise for all tickets being 3.9 per cent.

Transport minister Norman Baker outraged passengers this month when he insisted that despite overcrowding, disruption and inflationary fare rises commuters were getting a ‘premium service’.

He said fares were not overly expensive when off-peak tickets – and not just the most costly rush-hour ones – were taken into account.

Mr Baker accepted the above-inflation rises were ‘not ideal’ and wanted to end them as soon as possible, but did not put a timescale on it.

He added: ‘You could argue people who are travelling in the rush hour are using the premium product and ought to pay something which reflects that.’
