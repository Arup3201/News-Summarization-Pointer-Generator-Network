A journalist who says she was forced out of the BBC after 30 years claims ageism and sexism within the corporation is still rife.

Olenka Frenkiel, 59, was asked to sign a gagging confidentiality agreement when she left in 2012, but she refused on the basis that she wanted to speak openly about discrimination.

The reporter, who was the first BBC journalist to cover reports of the Berlin Wall collapse, has spoken out after hearing evidence in the House of Lords select committee on broadcasting and women.

She told the Guardian: 'I find it extraordinary that BBC Current Affairs still claims it's trying to find older women - when it's spent the past decade getting rid of us.

'I don’t like it that the greatest broadcasting organisation in the world is getting away with not telling the truth. 

Frenkiel, who also makes documentaries, claims it's not just presenters who are being pushed out when they get older - it is reporters 'who appear on screen for their journalism'. 

She told the paper that for a while she 'fought back' by asking round other departments in the hope that she would get her films commissioned, after they were rejected by her own bosses.

The former Newsnight presenter describes the process as being 'starved' of work so you seem unproductive and then fighting to be heard, which comes off as being 'difficult'.

Eventually she began to notice the men of her age were thriving while the women were gone and she was being 'rubbed out' - and she decided to leave quietly. 

Her complaint comes three years after Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly successfully sued the BBC for age discrimination after she was dismissed from the programme.

The then director general, Mark Thompson, said the case would be a turning point for the corporation - but Frenkiel emailed him the very same day to argue that such judgments were still happening.

She reportedly told him the current policy employed by the BBC which forces middle-aged women to leave 'has to stop'.

Another former BBC reporter, Liz Mackean, also refused to sign a gagging order when she left 18 months ago, after her film on the Jimmy Savile scandal was controversially cancelled.

She has pointed out that the fact there are fewer older women than men suggests 'a gender bias'.

However, the BBC claims that around one in six female presenters are aged over 50, while nearly 25 per cent of female news correspondents are in the same age range.

A BBC spokesman said: 'We actually have many excellent experienced female journalists across BBC News: Lyse Doucet, Orla Guerin, Sarah Montague, Martha Kearney, Carole Walker and Maxine Mawhinney among others. 

'Maxine is one of the best known faces on the BBC News Channel, and we’ve increased the number of presenter appearances of Carole Walker too in recent months. 

'We will continue to work hard to make sure our presenting teams are as diverse as possible.'

The spokesman added that improving representation of women on-air is a priority for the organisation and said they have been working hard to achieve.

Other female presenters disgruntled by their treatment by broadcasters include Anna Ford, who claimed she was jilted because of her age when she left the BBC in 2006 at the age of 62.

While Selina Scott was awarded £250,000 by Channel 5 after she successfully sued them for ageism in 2008 when she was 57.

The current director general, Tony Hall, announced last year that the BBC would stop using the controversial gagging orders.
