A referendum on Britain leaving the European Union would go ahead even if the Tories are forced to enter a second coalition with the Lib Dems, it emerged today.

Senior Lib Dems indicated that they would not block David Cameron's promise of an in-out vote by 2017, with Nick Clegg saying he would 'relish' the battle to stay in the EU.

But splits emerged at the party's conference in Glasgow, as Vince Cable insisted the referendum promised by the Tories is 'just not on offer as far as we are concerned'.

Treasury minister Danny Alexander signalled he would be open to negotiating a referendum with the Tories in the event of another hung parliament

Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate a new deal with the EU, clawing back powers from Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum in 2017.

Under pressure from Eurosceptics, Mr Cameron has made clear he will not argue for Britain to remain in the EU if it is not in the national interest.

At last week's Tory conference, Mr Cameron said: 'We're going to go in as a country, get our powers back, fight for our national interest.

'And yes – we'll put it to a referendum, in or out – it will be your choice, and let the message go out from this hall: it is only with a Conservative Government that you will get that choice.'

The Lib Dems had argued that there was no need to have a referendum unless more powers are transferred to Brussels – something which few expect to happen.

However, at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mr Clegg and his closest ally Danny Alexander signalled that a referendum would not be a deal-breaker for a second coalition with the Tories.

Mr Alexander, the Chief Treasury Secretary, told a meeting on the fringe of the conference: 'Clearly, we'd have to be able to come to an agreement which was satisfactory to both parties.'

And pressed further on the issue later, Mr Alexander did not rule out talking to Tories about a referendum.

'We certainly haven't engaged in any discussions with any other party about what might happen after the election,' Mr Alexander said.

'We will certainly make the case in terms of what our priorities are and it will be up to the British people to decide which party has the strongest mandate. Of course, we would engage in conversations with them if that were to happen.

'I'm not going to get into trying to pre-negotiate coalition agreements on the result of an election which hasn't happened.'

But Business Secretary Vince Cable insisted the Lib Dems would not sign up to the referendum being promised by the Tories

Officically the Lib Dems are in favour of a referendum on the EU if 'there is a change in the rules.'

But Mr Clegg today said he would 'relish' an in-out referendum. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'The Conservative Party are tearing themselves up about Europe so they have now plucked out of thin air an arbitrary date - 2017 - when a referendum would take place.

'We have in law a guarantee about when a referendum will take place, when the rules of the game change.

'More than that, I say that the question on the ballot paper should be in or out and I would relish that moment.'

However, Business Secretary Vince Cable appeared to rule out a deal with Tories on an in/out referendum, telling a separate fringe meeting: 'Our commitment to the EU is an absolute one ... We have made it clear that the kind of referendum the Tories want is just not on offer as far as we are concerned.'

Mr Cable also warned that intimidation of pro-European companies could become a 'serious problem' if an in/out referendum was staged.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg insisted he would 'relish' the battle to keep Britain in the European Union

Eurosceptic Conservative ex-minister John Redwood was last week reported to have said that 'out' campaigners would 'make life difficult' for businesses which speak out in favour of continued EU membership in ways which would be 'deeply disruptive to their businesses, and maybe even to their own tenure of their jobs'.

His remarks at last week's Conservative conference came after widespread complaints of the bullying of businesses which spoke out against Scottish independence in the recent referendum campaign.

Mr Cable - who described himself as 'not a member of the John Redwood fan club' - said: 'The intimidation issue ... is potentially a serious problem if we do get to a referendum.

'I came up to Scotland during the long campaign and there were a lot of businesses who said they didn't wish to be publicly quoted. Sometimes it was for perfectly good industrial reasons - they didn't want their labour force, they didn't want their management to be quarrelling. They didn't want to alienate their customers, which is understandable.

'But some of them were frightened that there would be some kind of retribution.

'If we are getting - hopefully not - a European Union referendum, the last thing we need is for companies to be intimidated and prevented from saying what they really think.'
