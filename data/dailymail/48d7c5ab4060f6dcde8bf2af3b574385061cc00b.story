This beautiful $20million New York living room may be the most covetable in the world.

The vast lounge on the city's Upper West Side is 24 feet high and boasts breathtaking views over the city's American Museum of Natural History and Central Park.

Floor-to-ceiling Corinthian columns give the feeling of being in a museum, castle, or giant public library and draw the eye upwards toward a magnificent Miro-style mural in Venetian plaster.

Treasure trove: The luxurious upper West Side living room is filled with desirable and expensive objects

Fairytale lifestyle: Incredible views over Central Park are highlighted by gigantic floor-to-ceiling windows and elegant cream-coloured walls and furnishings

Art lovers: The Miro-style ceiling is complemented by eclectic pieces of art including works by Cuban master Emilio Sanchez

The gorgeous swirls of blue, white and yellow were painted on to the ceiling by Madrid-based artist Ramon Canet, who lived and worked in the apartment while its owners were renovating it.

On one wall is a vast, working stone fireplace built in the 17th-century on the Iberian Peninsula and at one end of the vast room are a wooden table and chair set by George Nakashimi, arguably the top woodworking artisan of the 20th century.

The room is not just a gallery of elegant items, however, but looks lived-in, with children's plastic toys scattered in a corner.

Perfect setting: The American Museum of Natural History can be seen from the spacious room, which is half as long as a basketball court

Height of taste: Floor-to-ceiling Corinthian columns give the feeling of being in a museum, castle, or giant public library and draw the eye upwards toward the magnificent mural in Venetian plaster

Living the high life: Stunning views offered from the $20million building

The Latin American couple who 
currently live in the apartment have filled the room with valuable works
of art by famous painters including Cuban master Emilio Sanchez, according to the New York Daily News.

The female owner, who purchased the 
home in 1997 and works in philanthropy and finance, said: 'As soon as I 
walked in and saw this room, I said, "I’ll take it".

'I saw 130 apartments. I
needed someplace for art. Here, it was the light, space and 
flexibility. I just thought this room could be anything. That’s what 
makes it so special: If you have imagination, this room can be anything 
you want it to be.'

Home is where the art is: Photographs and paintings line the walls of the impressive corridor

To sleep, perchance to dream: The kind of bedroom most of us can only dream about

Let it sink in: Bathroom is beautifully presented, and brimming with artworks, like much of the apartment

She and her partner, who works in art, are now selling their much-loved apartment because they have grandchildren and matters to attend to in other countries.

Photographs of happy moments line the low-slung shelf below the wall of 
windows, restored four years ago by specialists who work on historic 
spaces.

Turn to the gigantic steel-cased windows of the room - which is half as long as a basketball court - and you can gaze at the vibrant sights of a mucch-loved city.

But it may be hard to tear your eyes away from a room with this much charisma.

The rest of the home is equally stunning, with impressive corridors, a bright bathroom and daring, bright red study.

Red alert: Huge couch and book case in bright scarlet make a bold statement

Bold: The cream carpet is the only neutral color in this striking study
