These inspiring images may look like the promotional photos for the next Olympics, but in fact the subjects are normal office workers - without using Photoshop.

When Canadian snapper Benjamin Von Wong was asked to take photos of the staff at the offices of SmugMug, a photography website, he captured them posed as elite athletes.

Using great lighting and a homemade rain machine, the staff, which included a 61-year-old grandfather and grandmother, 62, were transformed into muscular, chiseled athletic beings.

Grandmother Toni snapped from behind looking magnificent lifting dumbbells said: 'I'm a 62-year-old grandma. And still, somehow, he manages to make me look great!'

'We took 2000 shots in a single day in order to produce fewer than 20 final photographs,'  Von Wong says.

'I think that people were quite blown away by the results — they'd never really thought that they could look so awesome.

'They'd come to the computer, check out the images, and run back to shoot some more.' 

Front office executive Stephanie, 24, was transformed by Von Wong's lens into a top fitness instructor. 'When people saw the photos it was a lot of shock and awe. I didn't even think I looked like that,' she says

'The first thing that comes to mind when one thinks black and white portraiture is old school, classical, traditional. But Von Wong says he wanted to create something edgy, impactful and extreme.

'With only a couple days to pull something together, I had SmugMug's facilities manager build a rain machine for me with a $10 budget and a couple hours of hard work.' 

So what are Von Wong's tips to creating transformative photography?

A tire and rope combined with the right expression gave a sense of movement and life, says Von Wong

Not a professional athlete! The model sporting his every day look ... a far cry from the photo above

'Make the ordinary extraordinary.' he advises. 'Keeping an open mind on how to leverage the environment around you is key to doing great work. 

'A simple tire and rope combined with the right expression gave  images a sense of movement and life.'

'Both are slightly awkward objects with no classic way to photograph them so being open to experiment until the image makes sense is key to getting great shots.

So what's the key to creating that incredible definition? 'When you're trying to carve out muscle and definition hard edgy and directional lighting works best.

'In my case I used four lights to achieve the effect I wanted, but you can pull off something pretty similar with just two lights in soft boxes at 90 degrees from your models.

He adds: 'Tweak the lighting and camera as much as you want to prep your set, but once everything is all ready to go focus on talking your model through different movements, exercises, expressions especially if they're not professional models.

'Even if they are, letting them know that they're looking amazing as you're shooting is as helpful as coffee in the morning.'

'Regardless if you go for a black and white or colour, the main focus of the image has to always be the subject in question. 

'Make sure that distractions are removed and that your subjects pop into focus first and foremost.

'In my case, any distracting or bright raindrops were toned down just a little bit and a soft vignette was masked in so that my subjects in the centre would pop out just a little bit more. 

Most of all, says Von Wong, it's about being brave.

'There are no rules if the only requirement is to make people look awesome. Don't limit yourself to the same safe shots, try different things. You never know what you'll discover. 

'Don't focus on the resources you don't have, focus on being resourceful.'
