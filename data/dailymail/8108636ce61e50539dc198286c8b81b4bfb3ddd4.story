Three prison guards are on unpaid leave for allegedly organizing the 'Retard Olympics' - in which they forced inmates to fight each other in exchange for coffee and snacks.

The Pennsylvania State Police are investigating corrections officers David Michael Whitcomb, 28, Mark Andrew Haynes, 26, and Daniel H Graff, 37, for 'official oppression' carried out between January and July.

York Country Prison found out about the alleged abuse while looking at surveillance footage related to graffiti happening in the prison.

The footage that sparked the investigation showed Haynes grabbing an inmate named David Wright by the neck from behind.

Wright has since detailed more about how Haynes, Graff and Whitcomb treated him and some of the other inmates.

He said that the guards would offer him food if he would fight with other inmates or let them punch and kick him.

Wright calls these challenges the 'Retard Olympics' for all the 'stupid stuff' he would do for food and coffee. And sometimes, the officers didn't even follow through on their promises of food.

Wright fought other inmates and the guards in wrestling matches organized in a storage closet.

During one brawl, Wright says that officer Graff cut off his air supply before he could 'tap out'. He also says that Whitcomb choked him out once, and that Haynes offered him food if he could punch him in the arm.

Another time, Wright was punched in the arms and legs by Graff and Whitcomb until they went numb.

And it wasn't just fighting. The three men challenged him to drink a gallon of milk in an hour, snort crushed-up candy, drink water laced with pepper foam, get sprayed with pepper foam, eat a spoonful of cinnamon and eat fruit with the peels still on them.

So far, two of the men have made public statements denying the alleged abuse.

'I did not participate in any of it, and I did not witness any of this,' Whitcomb told The Mercury. 'There is no physical evidence, no medical records. They didn't file any complaints when it was supposed to have happened. This is all on the word of an inmate. It blows my mind.'

Graff said it never happened and that he believes the allegations are part of a get-rich-quick scheme. 

'They've been telling other inmates that they're going to sue the York County Prison for millions of dollars,' Graff said. 'Personally, I think this is what this is.'

The men are members of the Local 776 union of Teamsters, who have filed a complain on their behalf since they have been suspended for three months and there has been no resolution to the allegations.

The York County Prison issued a statement of their own on Friday, following the suspensions.

'The actions alleged by Pennsylvania State Police in this case run counter to the professional behavior county and prison management expect and require of all staff. Misconduct within any county agency is not tolerated.'
