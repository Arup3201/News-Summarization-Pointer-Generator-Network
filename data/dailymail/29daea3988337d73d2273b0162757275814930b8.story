According to the Mirror, Barkley and Walker have had 'discussions' in Liverpool nightclub Playground recently, a popular hangout for WAGs such as Abbey Clancey and Alex Gerrard.

Officers from Merseyside police confirmed they spoke to Barkley recently after he received a call from a 'third party' about a different threat, but the sportsman declined to make a complaint.

The tension around Barkley could prove crucial for England manager Roy Hodgson as he looks to select his final 23 for the World Cup

Barkley is widely tipped to make the list for the tournament, taking place in Brazil this summer,after a stellar season with Everton in which he has scored five goals in 45 appearances.

That has helped the Toffees to fifth place in the Premier League, one point behind Arsenal, and within touching distance of Champions League football next season.

Walker, who was in court in February this year to admit a charge of possessing class A drugs, has previously been pictured smoking what appears to be a joint

Walker was previously jailed for being part of a gang dealing heroin and crack cocaine.

He served half of his four year, eight month sentence before being released on licence in 2012.

But he had his sentence extended last August when he admitted sending a threatening Â­voicemail to a police officer.

In February last year he was cleared at 
Sheffield crown court of being involved in a plan to smuggle drugs into 
Doncaster prison while an inmate there.

But he was back in court in February this year to plead guilty to possessing class A drug ecstasy, while denying another charge of carrying counterfeit currency.

In 2008, internet pictures of Walker in prison emerged, which showed him Â­apparently smoking a spliff.
