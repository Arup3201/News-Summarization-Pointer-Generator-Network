Nigel Ackland, 53, has been fitted with the Terminator-like carbon fibre mechanical hand which he can control with movements in his upper arm

A father who lost his arm in an accident six years ago has been given a new lease of life by a hi-tech bionic hand which is so precise he can type again.

Nigel Ackland, 53, has been fitted with the Terminator-like carbon fibre mechanical hand which he can control with movements in his upper arm.

The new bebionic3 myoelectric hand, which is also made from aluminium and alloy knuckles, moves like a real human limb by responding to Nigel’s muscle twitches.

Incredibly, the robotic arm is so sensitive it means the father-of-one can touch type on a computer keyboard, peel vegetables, and even dress himself for the first time in six years.

Mr Ackland operates the futuristic arm by sending the same signal from his brain he used to operate his original, human arm.

When the muscles in the upper arm are flexed, this is detected by sensors that trigger one of 14 pre-programmed grips, mirroring human movements.

The different grip patterns include a clenched fist, a pointed finger and a pinching motion, according to how the user tenses their upper arm.

He is one of just seven people in the world to be given the arm as part of a four-month trial, which it is hoped will see the electronic arm made publicly available.

Mr Ackland, who worked as a smelter, was forced to retire after losing his arm.

He said his new hand has given him 'a whole new quality of life'.

He said: 'I knew straight away that the end result of my accident would be horrible so I asked for my arm to be cut off, which was the right decision in the end as the arm was dead anyway.

'I tried to go back to work but I really struggled, everyday tasks were extremely hard.

'When you lose a part of you it can 
take you into quite a dark place - it is a shame the bebionic3 isn’t 
available for everyone, it is a whole new quality of life.

'Prior
to this I used prosthetic limbs provided by the NHS which were 
horrible. I used a hook which didn’t resemble a hand at all.

'I
am slowly becoming more at one with it, the fingers even move when I 
yawn and stretch, but it will never be the same as having my own hand.

'Things like tying a shoe lace and chopping a vegetable are now much easier. I have been blown away by the robotic hand, I could sit and watch it all day - I feel like the Terminator.'

Mr Ackland has trialled the world's most advanced prosthetic limb - the bebionic3 hand - which has transformed his life. Made from aluminium and alloy knuckles, it moves like a real human limb by responding to his muscle twitches

The hand features a lifelike appearance and grip patterns which can be wirelessly programmed and tailored to suit each individual's requirements

Right-handed Mr Ackland, who lives with his wife Vanessa, 50, and son Conor, 19, in Royston, Cambridgeshire, lost his arm when it became caught in an industrial blending machine at a smelting plant in 2006.

The metal worker instantly knew he had lost the lower-half of his limb even though doctors worked frantically to save it.

After six months of operations and infections he decided to have a below-elbow amputation.

But the severity of his injury meant his amputation wasn’t straightforward and left him with a flared stump and difficulty finding suitable prosthetics.

His injuries meant he was forced to take early retirement, but struggled to help at home became his dexterity was limited to the basic tasks he could perform with a replacement hook.

He was approached by Leeds-based prosthetics company, RSLSteeper, in May this year and asked if he would like to trail their latest hand - the most high-tech available in the world. It will be unveiled officially for the first time tomorrow at a launch event in London.

The hand features a lifelike appearance and grip patterns which can be wirelessly programmed and tailored to suit each individual’s requirements.

To make it look as natural as possible the hand can be covered with a realistic silicone skin, available in 19 different shades, although Mr Ackland has not been given one for the trial.

While the hand has changed his life, he says it still has limitations and the keen musician has not been able to start playing the piano and saxophone again.

Mr Ackland said he hopes company bosses will be able to let him keep the arm, or make alternative arrangements for him to get a replacement.

He added: 'When you first lose a limb it can take a massive blow to your confidence. People in the street don’t really know how to react to the fact that you have no arm and as a result you can be left feeling exceptionally withdrawn.

'With the Terminator arm people will come up and ask you about it. It is almost like it is science fiction for them which is amazing. For the first time in six years I’m finally back in the loop.

'People notice it when I am just walking along in the street and they come and ask questions.'I don’t really like people feeling sorry for me or shying away from me, so for that not to be happening is life-changing.

'Since I started the trial it has made a massive difference to my day-to-day life and my health as well.

'For example if you have two arms, two hands and you need to pull your trousers on, you can do it in four or five swift moves.

'If you do it one handed you are looking at 18 or 19 moves so your body is forever over worked and run down.

'With the special arm I can hold my dogs lead, hold the vegetables when I’m cutting them and even grab my bank cards.

'It is like being your old-self, with a very cool piece of machinery helping you.'
