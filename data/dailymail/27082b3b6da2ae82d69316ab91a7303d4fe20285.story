New York Giants linesman David Diehl who admitted getting behind the wheel of his car in a drunken stupor in June of 2012 and crashing into two cars was sentenced to a conditional discharge on Monday and even escaped having to pay the $1,200 in damages.

Diehl, who has two Super-Bowl rings, pleaded guilty in February to aggravated driving while intoxicated after his arrest last summer when he careered his BMW into two parked cars after drinking heavily while watching a Croatian soccer match in Astoria, New York City.

Prosecutors in the case told the court that Diehl's blood alcohol content was .182, which is significantly over the legal limit of .08. - the NFL star had faced up to a year in prison.

As part of the plea deal, Diehl will 
have to stay in the NFL's substance abuse program and while he was 
supposed to pay for the damages, the prosecution admitted he has not 
been billed.

In the aftermath of the incident,
the 6'5, 304lb player used his Twitter account to apologize for 
crashing into the parked cars in Queens.

One bystander, Al, 48, told the New York Daily News: 'He was totally obliterated. He couldn’t even function.'

Diehl entered no plea at court in June 2012 and spent the night in a cell wearing his Croatian soccer top.

Diehl wrote on Twitter last year: 'I’ve worked 
hard during my career to set a positive example, and yesterday I fell 
far short of this standard. I apologize to my family, my fans, my 
teammates, the New York Giants, and the NFL.

'I made a poor decision that I sincerely regret, and, as always, take full responsibility for my actions.'

Diehl, 31, whose relatives hail from 
Croatia, twice tweeted 'Gooooooaaaaalllll!!!!!' in celebration as the 
team scored on his Twitter account.

A photograph of him wearing a red and white chequered 
Croatia replica shirt was also posted on Twitter, but it was removed 
following his arrest.

Diehl, who has twice won the Super 
Bowl with the Giants, wrecked his black BMW at about 8.20pm in early June, 2012, in the Astoria area of the city. No one was injured. He had been driving alone and was arrested at the scene.

Diehl was taken to a police station and he failed a breath test.

The Twitter user who posted the 
picture of Diehl said the star was celebrating at Scorpio Cafe & Bar
in Astoria, which is five blocks from the crash site at Broadway and 
31st Street.

Police confirmed the player had been to a local bar.

Diehl had been watching the Croatia team move to the top of Group C at the Euro 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine.

He tweeted 'Gooooooaaaaalllll!!!!!' twice and later wrote '3-1' when the team's win was confirmed.

The final tweet carried the hashtag '#hrvatska', which means Croatia in its native language.

The player’s agent, Peter Schaffer, declined to comment after the arrest, but called Diehl 'one of, if not the classiest, most humble ... New York Giants ever'.
