Claire Blackman, the wife of Royal Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman, says she has been overwhelmed by the support shown to him since he was jailed for murder

The wife of jailed Royal Marine Alexander Blackman last night said she was ‘overwhelmed’ by support for calls for his freedom.

Claire Blackman praised the ‘outstanding’ backing from more than 100,000 people, including MPs and senior military figures.

There is now huge momentum behind the campaign to urge senior judges to reduce the commando’s sentence or even quash his conviction for murdering an Afghan insurgent.

The 39-year-old sergeant must serve at least ten years in prison after being found guilty last month of executing the severely wounded Taliban prisoner in Helmand in September 2011. But the severity of the punishment has sparked a massive wave of support for the first British serviceman to be convicted of murder on active service abroad since the Second World War.

Many believe Blackman should have received a more lenient sentence reflecting how the intense stress of fighting on the front line led to a ‘moment of madness’.

Speaking on behalf of Mrs Blackman, solicitor Issy Hogg said: ‘She has been overwhelmed by the tremendous kindness and outstanding support which the British public has shown and would like to express her gratitude for the comfort this continues to provide.’

She added that Mrs Blackman ‘wishes to avoid the glare of publicity at this difficult time’.

Last night a petition on a government website calling for Blackman to be freed had attracted more than 26,000 names.

Another 80,000 people had used Facebook to call for the non-commissioned officer – dismissed from the elite corps in disgrace – to also have his conviction overturned.

Lord Ashcroft, the billionaire Tory peer, wrote on Twitter that he could help bankroll the appeal.

However, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said it would be ‘wrong’ to comment on the clamour for a reduced sentence.

He said: ‘This is an independent judicial
 decision. The court will have had all the facts, including pleas in 
mitigation around the sentencing decision. There may well be an appeal 
over the sentence.’

Meanwhile, a survey found that six out of ten people thought the commando’s prison sentence should be halved to five years.

One in three of the 900 people questioned by pollsters Survation felt he should serve no jail time at all. Blackman’s legal team have pledged to fight for a reduced sentence at the Court Martial Appeal Court and are studying whether there are grounds to challenge the conviction itself.

Supporters have pointed to the case of Canadian soldier Captain Robert Semrau, who was kicked out of the Canadian Army but spared prison for shooting a severely wounded insurgent in 2008.

Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said: ‘The court should have paid greater attention to this man’s fine record and that he had done several tours of duty in Afghanistan.’

Lord West of Spithead, a former head of the Royal Navy, said it would be a ‘coup’ for Islamic extremists if they succeeded in capturing or killing relatives of Blackman, known during his trial as Marine A, in retaliation.

‘By releasing his name, it is dangerous not just for the marine in prison but also his family,’ he said. ‘I hope somebody is talking to his family and is keeping an eye out.’

Left-wing MP Eric Joyce, a former soldier, said: ‘I doubt whether the judge has the first idea of what it is like to be on the battlefield when bullets are flying around.’

The court martial heard on Friday that Blackman was suffering from combat stress when he murdered the Taliban captive, a scene filmed on a colleague’s helmet-mounted camera. He was also trying to deal with the grief of his father’s death months earlier.

He lost his cool near the end of a ‘tour from hell’ in which 23 servicemen died and insurgents had hung the limbs of maimed British troops in trees as ‘trophies’.

Blackman, from Taunton, Somerset, claimed he thought the insurgent was already dead but he was told by a judge he had ‘tarnished the reputation’ of Britain’s armed forces.
