A four-wheel drive has crashed into a Sydney cafe during rush hour and injured seven people while it was trying to park.

Police were called to the Wild Basket cafe on Grosvenor Road, Neutral Bay on the city's north shore, after reports of the accident at about 9am on Wednesday.

One female patron, who was dragged to the back of the business by the speeding car, was trapped under the vehicle for 20 minutes before being freed by Fire and Rescue personnel, according to Detective Inspector Mike Birley.

Seven people were injured  after a 4WD (pictured) smashed into a North Sydney cafe

Four people were rushed to hospital including one woman who suffered severe leg injuries 

She was rushed to hospital with severe leg injuries but is in a non-life threatening condition.  

The driver of the 4WD, a man aged in his 50s, has been taken to Royal North Shore Hospital to undergo mandatory blood and urine testing, police have said. 

'[He was] attempting to park his vehicle as he inadvertently accelerated into the café hitting seven people who were situated inside having coffee,' Detective Insp. Birley said. 

'The speed at which the car reversed into the café didn't allow people to get out of the way, so we are very fortunate that they were not more seriously injured.' 

The other six customers at the Wild Basket cafe only received minor injuries 

The seven people who were injured had been sitting at tables inside the cafe

The driver was taken away on crutches by police and is believed to have been suffering from a disability.

Witnesses said he was 'incredibly apologetic' about the incident.

Three other people were also rushed to hospital with non life-threatening injuries, according to an ambulance spokesperson. 

The other six customers received only minor injuries and are all in a stable condition.

The car, a silver Lexus, could be seen parked on the footpath outside the cafe after being removed from  the scene. 

A large scratched dent could be seen on the side of the vehicle, with the rear-view mirror hanging on precariously.

An emotional cafe owner was at the scene and police are investigating the damage to the cafe, where scattered stools and broken glass can still be seen outside.

Residents in the flat above were escorted out of the building and police have closed the road to cars.

Jenni Heads, the owner of Woodlands Kitchen Bar next door to the Wild Basket café, said she has been left 'shaken' after the accident.

Ms Heads arrived 20 minutes after the incident occurred, to see her friend's business closed off with police tape.

'It's a very tight knit community here and we know the guests who come in to the restaurant every day, so she [the café's owner] would have known the people who were quite seriously injured. It's a horrible thing to have happened,' she told Daily Mail Australia.
