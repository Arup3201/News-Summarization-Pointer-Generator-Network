Crystal Palace are trying to land Zeki Fryers from Tottenham.  

Former Manchester United left-back Fryers is way down the pecking order at White Hart Lane following the arrival of Ben Davies from Swansea and looks set to leave by Monday.

Warnock has put a new left-back at the top of his priority, with QPR's Armand Traore another contender to fill that slot.

Committed: But Zeki Fryers' future could lie away from White Hart Lane with Crystal Palace interested 

Fryers made 16 appearances for Spurs last season after signing from Belgian club Standard Liege. 

But he also has new England call-up Danny Rose and Kyle Naughton blocking his place in the first team. 

Fryers made his debut against Dinamo Tblisi in the Europa League last August.
