An inventive photographer captured this collection of stunning images that show highways in the night sky.

Kevin Cooley used a long-exposure lens to take these images of the light trails left by aircraft in the skies over the U.S.

His long-exposure technique does not just capture the trail of light left behind the planes as they pass over head, but also the eerie stillness of the landscapes they illuminate.

Highway in the sky: A plane's contrails and lights are frozen in time in this long-exposure picture by Kevin Cooley

Blazing a trail: This plane's light trail shines so bright it appears like a meteorite burning through the atmosphere

The lights of several aircraft are seen in a trail lighting up the inky black night

Frozen in time: The shutter was left open for long periods upwards of five minutes to capture the images

Such long exposures meant the pictures could pick up even the faintest glimmers of reflected light

Into the distance: Cooley's work is featured in some of America's most important public art collections

Prolific: He has also had work published in The New Yorker, Marie Claire and Harper's

Project: Cooley travelled to airports across the U.S. to capture these incredible images

Special equipment: They were shot using a specialist Linhof Technikardan 45s large format camera through a 135mm Schneider Apo-Symmar lens

Based in Brooklyn, New York, Cooley's 
works sit in renowned collections including at the SolomonR Guggenheim 
Museum and the Schwartz Art Collection at Harvard Business School.

His works have been frequently 
published in upmarket magazines including The New Yorker, Marie Claire 
and Harper's, and he has also taken from commissions from high-profile 
clients including Architectural Record, Bomb Magazine, GQ, Newsweek 
Japan and the New York Times Magazine.

Cooley's carefully composed pictures 
describe the world almost like a painting, contrasting darkness with 
man-made light sources in the context of beautiful landscape backdrops, critics have said.

For these images he visited major 
airports around America, including LAX in Los Angeles, JFK and EWR in 
New York, and ETC in North Carolina, PetaPixel reported.

They were shot using a specialist Linhof Technikardan 45s large format camera through a 135mm Schneider Apo-Symmar lens.

By setting the aperture to f.22 and 
leaving the shutter open for long periods upwards of four to five 
minutes for each shot, Cooley was able to capture the trails left by 
aircraft lights as they buzzed overhead.

In this incredible picture the lights from the planes that have flown overhead hang in the sky like the threads of some luminous spider's web

'In the case of this series, many minutes or even hours add up to construct a single image punctuated by the paths of commercial airplanes traversing the night skies,' Cooley said in a statement

'These white streaks, the only aspect of the planes visible in the photographs, are created by the landing and navigation lighting on every plane,' he added

In a statement accommpanying the 
project, Cooley said: 'Photography is by nature an exploration of time. 
The blink of an eye may be frozen by the shutter.

'Or in the case of this series, many 
minutes or even hours add up to construct a single image punctuated by 
the paths of commercial airplanes traversing the night skies.

'These white streaks, the only aspect 
of the planes visible in the photographs, are created by the landing and
 navigation lighting on every plane.

'Each line represents the amount of time it takes a commercial flight to pass through the frame.'

The special techniques Cooley used to capture the light trails also emphasises the brightness of all the other lights in the frame, as seen here

Thanks to Cooley's long-exposure technique, even dark suburbs like this appear brightly lit in his images
