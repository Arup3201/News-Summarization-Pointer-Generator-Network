This is the moment a traffic warden slapped £70 parking tickets on two minibuses carrying disabled children after they raised hundreds of pounds for a homeless charity by singing in a carol concert.

The youngsters, many in wheelchairs, were being lifted into two specially-adapted ambulances in Nottingham when the enforcement officer wrote out two penalty notices before walking away.

The twelve children from Oak Field School and Sports College in Bilborough, Nottinghamshire, were returning from the concert on Monday afternoon which raised £370 when they were hit with the fines.

Disgusted Christmas shoppers watched the scene as the officer stuck tickets on the windscreens of the two minibuses, which were parked in a city centre loading bay to let the children board

Witness Shelley Mawby said a group of onlookers tried to reason with the warden and asked him to show leniency, but he refused to back down and told them he had no choice but to issue the tickets.

She said: ‘A group of people gathered and were as shocked as me. When confronted, the warden said “I'm just doing my job”. It was unbelievable.’

Office worker Wayne Rogers added: ‘I took the images from my place of work as I was so disgusted with the action of this person. I was not the only one and several other passers-by took pictures.’

Headteacher David Stewart slammed the warden for his lack of insensitivity and said public transport was not an option for the school as there were too many wheelchairs to fit on one bus.

He said: ‘It's the irony of it. The youngsters had all gone carol singing to raise money for Emmanuel House - which the city council has cut funding from - and then they ended up with a £140 fine.

‘These children are also wheelchair users so trying to get them anywhere in the city is difficult so it does take time.

‘An able-bodied person could be in and out of a bus in a second but we have to lift the wheelchair in and then make sure it's clamped, which is what was happening when the ticket was issued and people passing by just couldn't believe it was happening.

‘I know people have a job to do and it 
is a no-loading zone but these are not boxes being loaded into a van, 
these are children getting on a bus - and if you were that person I 
think you would use a bit of judgement.’

Labour-run Nottingham City Council apologised to the school and has since revoked both fines.

A spokesman said: ‘Our civil enforcement officers are expected to, and usually do, exercise discretion and judgement when dealing with situations where there may be a technical breach of regulations but where wider circumstances or sensitivities should be taken into account.

'If in any doubt, they can call managers to ask for advice about how best to proceed.  We are sorry this didn't happen on this occasion and for any upset this may have caused.’

Liz Silver, of the Nottinghamshire Disabled People's Movement, said: ‘It's completely out of order and I can't 
understand why anyone would do it. It's ludicrous and shows a complete 
lack of awareness.

‘Generally the city isn't bad for accessibility and blue badge holders 
can apply for access into areas where vehicles wouldn't normally be 
allowed. But a school like this should have instant access and it shows 
there needs to be more flexibility.’
