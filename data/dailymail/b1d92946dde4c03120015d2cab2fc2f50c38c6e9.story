The BBC provoked outrage yesterday by playing an offensive song propelled into the charts by enemies of Baroness Thatcher.

Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead failed to reach the number one spot. The recording, taken from 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, entered the charts at number two and BBC Radio 1's official chart show only played a five second clip of the song.

Former defence minister Sir 
Gerald Howarth said: ‘Like all Margaret Thatcher’s opponents, the people
 behind this song have failed to get to No 1.’

Controversial hit: The Wizard Of Oz track which has had a surge of 
popularity in the wake of Baroness Thatcher's death went to number 2 in 
the official charts

Online push: A message running on the Facebook group which has been set up to push the song in this week's chart

However the man behind the Facebook campaign, Mark Biddiss, said he was 'ecstatic' that the song made the top five.

Campaign: Protester Mark Biddiss says he is 'ecstatic' the song hit number two in the charts

It was more than 5,000 sales short of this week's chart-topper Need U (100%) by Duke Dumont featuring A*M*E.

The clip played on Radio 1 contained 
the controversial lyrics: 'Ding Dong the witch is dead. Which old witch?
 The wicked witch. Ding Dong, the wicked witch is dead.'

Radio 1 presenter Jameela Jamil handed over to music reporter Sinead Garvan, who said: 'Tributes poured in from around the world when (Margaret Thatcher) died, but there were also people throwing street parties across the UK.

'Like much of Margaret Thatcher's political career, this song has divided opinion.'

She then outlined that Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper had decided not to play the entire song and invited listeners to log onto the radio station's Newsbeat page to see his reasons.

On the page he said: 'I am not going to play it in full but I will play a clip of it. You have very difficult and emotional arguments on both sides of the fence.

'Let's not forget you also have a family that is grieving for a loved one who is yet to be buried.'

Biddiss, 39, defended his actions, which he says has seen him receive death threats. He said: 'I'm ecstatic. We have got people talking across the world.

'Hopefully people will start 
listening. There is a lot of pent-up frustration and the group was made 
up of people mainly over 40 who come from all walks of life who felt 
frustrated by Margaret Thatcher's policies and that her history has been
 airbrushed after she died.

'She's
 being lauded as our greatest ever leader, which is not correct. What 
she did in the UK and her policies are very much in evidence today and 
caused a lot of pain.

'It has been ridiculous how this has 
been portrayed. At the end of the day people were trying to get a 
voice.

'That song must have hit a nerve 
because people didn't have a voice. They have a voice now. Number one in
 Scotland, number one in Wales,' he said.

'I must say the public have been 
absolutely supportive. It has been absolutely amazing. It has been worth
 the occasional death threat I had and the 'I am a lefty music 
producer'- I am a satirist, and that is all,' he added.

When
 asked what Baroness Thatcher's children might feel when hearing the 
news, he said: 'I don't think they'll be happy but they are aware the 
consensus was she divided opinion.

'No
 one has been disrespectful to the children and grandchildren. I hope 
people show respect when it comes to the funeral. This is a lady, this 
is a person.'

However Tory MP Philip Davies added: ‘The whole campaign has been small-minded and ridiculous.

‘When you put this lot against the towering achievements of Mrs Thatcher, you see what a pathetic bunch they are.’

The Official Charts Company described 
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead as 'one of the most controversial chart 
contenders of all time'.

Place in the charts: The song is the shortest top 10 single ever, with the most popular version running to 51 seconds

It entered the charts at number 54 on
 Tuesday, the day after Baroness Thatcher's death, and climbed to number
 10 on Wednesday. By Thursday, it had reached number four and was at 
number three by Friday.

There
 was a final rush of 18,000 sales between Friday morning and yesterday, the 
Official Charts Company said, but its final total was 52,605 copies - 
5,700 behind Duke Dumont, which achieved 58,321 sales in the past week.

An Official Charts Company spokeswoman 
said it had been a 'relatively quiet' week for sales however, with the 
average sale of a number one in 2012 being just under 106,000 copies.

Some Tory MPs demanded the BBC ban 
the song - but others warned that politicians should not interfere in 
the choice of records played by broadcasters.

New
 BBC Director General Tony Hall has explained the broadcaster's decision
 to only play a five-second clip of the song as part of a news item 
during the Radio 1 chart show, saying: 'I personally believe it is 
distasteful and inappropriate.

'However
 I do believe it would be wrong to ban the song outright as free speech 
is an important principle and a ban would only give it more publicity.'

New director general Tony Hall defended playing the clip, saying: 'I do believe it would be wrong to ban the song outright as free speech is an important principle and a ban would only give it more publicity'

Former Tory MP Louise Mensch tweeted: 'It's so good to see that #HopeNotHate triumphed and #DingDidnt flopped at the fence. Much like her opponents in life :) #Thatcher'

On Friday UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: 'If you suppress things then you make them popular, so play the b***** thing. If you ban it it will be number one for weeks.

'Personally I think that the behaviour of these yobs - most of whom weren’t even born when Lady Thatcher was in power - is horrible, offensive and disgusting'.

Despite
 failing to reach the top spot, Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead has broken a
 new record by becoming the shortest top 10 single of all time and is 
the only one in history to be under a minute long.

Punk
 song I'm In Love With Margaret Thatcher by the Notsensibles, which was 
featured in recent film The Iron Lady, also entered the top 40 yesterday.

The
 1979 single reached number 35 after a push from fans of Lady Thatcher 
in response to Ding Dong The Witch is Dead and sold 8,768 copies.
