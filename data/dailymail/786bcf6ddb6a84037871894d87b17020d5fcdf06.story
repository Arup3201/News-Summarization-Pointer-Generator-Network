New pictures of the surface of Titan taken by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft show what looks like a giant hot cross bun rising out of the mysterious moon's crust.

Steam from baking often causes the top of bread to lift and crack.

Scientists think some similar process involving heat may be at play on Saturn's largest moon.

Hot cross bun: Scientists observing data from Nasa's Cassini spacecraft discovered this image of bread-like cracks in the surface of Titan, which is the larges moon orbiting Saturn

Deja vu: Scientists have seen similar terrain on Venus, where a dome-shaped region about 20 miles (30 km) across has been seen at the summit of a large volcano called Kunapipi Mons

Similar terrain has been pictured before
on Venus, where a dome-shaped region about 20 miles (30km) across has 
been seen at the summit of a large volcano called Kunapipi Mons.

Researchers believe the Titan cross, which is about 40 miles (70km) long, is also the result of fractures caused by uplift from below, possibly the result of rising magma.

'The 'hot cross bun' is a type of feature we have not seen before on Titan, showing that Titan keeps surprising us even after eight years of observations from Cassini,' said Rosaly Lopes, a Cassini radar team scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. 

'The 'bun' may be the result of what is known on Earth as a laccolith, an intrusion formed by magma pushing up from below.

The Henry Mountains of Utah are well-known examples of this geologic phenomenon.'

The image showing the bun-like mound was obtained on May 22, 2012, by Cassini’s radar instrument.

Another group of Cassini scientists, led by Ellen Stofan, who is based at Proxemy Research, Rectortown, Virginia, has been scrutinising radar images of Titan’s southern hemisphere where they found the shorelines of ancient seas.

Titan is the only place other than Earth known to have stable liquid on its surface, though the liquids on Titan are hydrocarbon rather than water.

So far, vast seas have only been seen in Titan’s northern hemisphere.

But now, a new analysis of Cassini images collected from 2008 to 2011 suggests there were once vast, shallow seas at Titan’s south pole as well.

This image from NASA's Cassini spacecraft shows an ancient southern sea that used to sprawl out near the south pole of Saturn's moon Titan. The red outline traces the ancient shoreline. Within this basin is the largest present-day lake in Titan's southern hemisphere, Ontario Lacus

Titan, pictured above in an image taken by the Cassini spacecraft, is one of the most Earth-like bodies in the Solar System.

With a thick atmosphere, a diameter between that of Earth and the planet Mercury, and a network of seas, lakes and rivers, it is in many respects more like a planet than a moon like the Earth’s.

With surface temperatures at a chilly -290F, researchers believe Titan's environment is too cold for life as we know it, but its environment, rich in the building blocks of life, is of great interest to astrobiologists.

The satellite's atmosphere is made up largely of nitrogen (like Earth’s), and is rich in organic compounds and hydrogen cyanide, which may have played a role in the emergence of life on Earth. The liquid on its surface is not water, but super-cooled methane and ethane.

Last month scientists revealed an ambitious plan to send a boat to Titan, which is Saturn's largest moon

Dr Stofan and her colleagues have 
found two good candidates for dry or mostly dry seas. One of these dry 
seas appears to be about 300 by 170 miles (475 by 280km) across, and 
perhaps a few hundred feet deep.

Ontario
Lacus, the largest current lake in the south, sits inside of the dry 
shorelines, like a shrunken version of a once-mighty sea.

Scientists led by Oded Aharonson, another radar team member based at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, think Titan is subject to cycles analogous to Earth’s Croll-Milankovich cycles, which explain climate changes in terms of the way our planet orbits around the Sun.

Such cycles on Titan would cause long-term transfer of liquid hydrocarbons from pole to pole. By this model, the south pole could have been covered with extensive seas less than 50,000 years ago.

'The seas on Titan are temporary hosts for experiments in prebiotic chemistry, and we know they are cycling from one hemisphere to the other over 100,000 years,' said Dr Stofan.

'I’d love to get a closer look at the seas of the north or these dry seabeds to examine the extent to which this prebiotic chemistry has developed.'

The Cassini team has confirmed some of the stability of Titan’s northern seas by looking at radar images from Cassini taken about one Titan season (in this case, six Earth years) apart.

The newer images, from May 22, 2012, on the same flyby as the hot cross bun images, show the shorelines stayed about the same, indicating the northern lakes are not transient weather events, in contrast to the temporary darkening of parts of the equator after a rainstorm in 2010.
