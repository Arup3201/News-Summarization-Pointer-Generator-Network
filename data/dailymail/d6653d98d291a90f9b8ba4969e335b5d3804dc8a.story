When a male colleague playfully slapped her behind as she bent over a desk, care assistant Kelly Daley laughed it off as horseplay.

Unfortunately, when she decided to take ‘playful’ revenge by confronting him in the care home laundry room and undoing buttons on his uniform, he didn’t see the funny side.

The man reported Miss Daley, 29, to management for bullying and sexual harassment, claiming his dignity was ‘violated’, an employment tribunal was told. It was also claimed she grabbed his genitals – which she strongly denied.

'Just harmless fun': Care worker Kelly Daley (pictured) was sacked after she undid the top buttons of a male colleague's uniform as a joke while another worker filmed it

Miss Daley and fellow carer Gemma 
Bartrop, 27, who filmed the button incident on her mobile phone, were 
sacked for gross misconduct. A female nurse who viewed the footage was 
also given a final written warning. However, the man, who had previously
slapped both their bottoms in similar incidents, escaped with a ticking
off.

He was also granted the legal right to
anonymity after the Sheffield tribunal decided the incident should be 
treated like a sexual offence.

Miss Daley claimed unfair dismissal 
against the owners of the privately-run home in Rotherham, South 
Yorkshire, but lost her case.

She had worked at the home for more than eight years and had a previously unblemished record.

‘I feel he has been treated far more leniently than me,’ she told the tribunal. ‘I feel I have been classed as a rapist.'

But the company claimed she had 
deliberately attempted to humiliate and demean the male assistant. Miss 
Daley said she was bending over a desk doing a time sheet in the office 
when the man slapped her bottom ‘quite hard’ and laughed.

She told him: ‘Don’t do that. I will 
get you back later.’ Miss Daley didn’t complain, but made good her 
promise later that day in the laundry room.

She said she undid one press stud on 
his uniform tunic as he fended her off with a laundry basket. The man 
said Miss Daley undid three buttons.

'It was not a nice experience and seemed to go on for ages. It scared me - they are not small lasses.'

Victim

Miss Daley said she was just teasing 
him and that ‘banter and horseplay’ was common among staff. She said 
that after undoing a button she told him: ‘I have got you back for 
slapping my bum earlier.’ She said: ‘I didn’t attack him, I just undid a
press stud.’

Miss Daley said she did not know her 
friend was filming or that she had talked of putting the footage on 
YouTube. ‘It was just banter and harmless fun,’ she said.

But the man told bosses he was left ‘uncomfortable, shocked, scared, on edge and nervous’.

The victim told investigators: ‘It was
not a nice experience and seemed to go on for ages. It scared me – they
are not small lasses.’

He claimed Miss Bartrop egged on Miss 
Daley, from Mexborough, South Yorkshire, and he was frightened it might 
have gone further. The victim said: ‘What started out as a laugh got out
of hand and has made me quite nervous.’

He claimed he had been humiliated and 
the incident in April had left him working in a ‘hostile, degrading and 
offensive’ environment. The care home company said the incident breached
its code of respect and its equality and diversity policy among its 
workforce.

Employment judge Martin Howard 
described it as an ‘unfortunate case’ and said he had ‘sympathy’ with 
the claimant. However, he concluded the home had fair and reasonable 
grounds to dismiss Miss Daley.
