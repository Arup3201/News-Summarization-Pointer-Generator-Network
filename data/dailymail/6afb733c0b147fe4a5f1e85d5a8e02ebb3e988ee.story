The parents of a four-month old baby found dead with traces of amphetamine in her system were spared an immediate jail sentence today after a judge heard they were 'consumed by guilt'.

Kiera Johnson died unexpectedly in the night while sleeping in her parents' bed in Washington, Tyne and Wear, last September.

Her parents Cheryl Lauderdale, 32, and Michael Johnson, 24, admitted cruelty charges on the basis the baby was exposed to amphetamine in the home she was growing up in.

Newcastle Crown Court was told that Lauderdale and Johnson, who are no longer together, were 'recreational users' of the class B drug.  

Prosecutors accept Kiera was not deliberately fed the drug and it did not cause or contribute towards her untimely death. It remains unclear why the little girl died. 

Today Lauderdale and Johnson were handed suspended prison terms after a judge at Newcastle Crown Court said they were 'consumed by guilt' over their daughter’s death, which had not been their fault. 

The court heard Kiera was born in May last year and she died on September 5.

Prosecutor Christopher Rose said: 'Traces of amphetamine were found in Kiera’s system following her death.

'The crown’s case is not that the presence of amphetamine in Kiera’s system contributed to her death.

'Her cause of death remains unascertained.'

Mr Rose said it was 'reckless' behaviour by the parents that led to the baby’s ingestion of the drug, which was a small amount, and she was not deliberately fed it.

Anne Richardson, defending Lauderdale, said: 'Whatever sentence the court passes will not bring her daughter back nor lessen the responsibility she feels.'

Johnson's barrister Glen Gatland said he was 'totally devastated; by the death of his daughter and puts himself through punishment daily because of it.

The court heard both parents have suffered cruel taunts because of what happened to their baby. 

Judge John Milford QC told them: 'You have lost your child, you have suffered that appalling bereavement that no parent should suffer.

'You are both, I am satisfied, consumed with guilt.

'You have both had to suffer hostile reaction of the communities in which you live, where others will see you as being responsible for the death when you are not.

'I think, because of the suffering you have both undergone, justice demands I suspend the sentences on you and I will.'

The judge issued a warning to other parents about drug use around children.

He added: 'Those who have care of children, be it parents or otherwise, who use within their homes controlled drugs, expose those children to two risks.

'The first risk is that the children will be physically harmed by coming into accidental contact with those drugs.

'The second, and probably the more likely cause of harm is that those children, when they are of an age to appreciate what is going on around them, will come to believe the smoking of cannabis, taking of amphetamine, injecting of heroin or whatever is a social norm and that their own lives will be adversely effected as a result'

Lauderdale, of Donwell, Washington, and Johnson, of Albany, Washington, both admitted child cruelty and possession of amphetamine, which was found in the house after the death.

Judge Milford sentenced them both to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with supervision and Johnson was also given a three month night time curfew.
