Nick Griffin, the former chairman of the British National Party, has been expelled from the far right group.

The BNP last night confirmed that Mr Griffin, 55, had been 'expelled from membership' amid claims that he had attempted to cause 'disunity' within the party.

In a damning letter, Adam Walker, the current BNP chairman, alleged that Mr Griffin had attempted to spread 'lies' about the party and had 'harrass[ed]' current members.

Expelled: Nick Griffin has been thrown out of the British National Party, which he led for several years

An hour and a half after the statement was released on the party’s website, the former politician, who had led the BNP for 15 years, took to Twitter to speak out against the decision.

He wrote: 'Breaking news! I’ve just been "expelled" without trial from the #BNP! That’ll teach me to tell a member of staff he’s a “useless, lazy t***”.'

Moments later, he compared the BNP to the former Sovet Union tweeting: 'Only thing is that the ruling Wigton Soviet are operating outside the constitution so I shall ignore their plastic gangster games.'

Mr Griffin stepped down from his leadership of the BNP in July this year, after losing his seat as an MEP, but was given an honorary title of President. He had declared bankruptcy months before leaving the group.

The politician has often hit headlines following controversial comments. In May, he described the Holocaust as a 'moral club' which had been 'exploited' to block criticism of immigration.

In 1997 he was handed a suspended prison sentence after being convicted of inciting racial hatred. Mr Griffin was ousted from the party following a review by its conduct committee.

Mr Jefferson, a member of the committee who did not provide his first name, said: 'This has been a difficult decision to make and not one taken lightly.

'Although we all appreciate that Nick has achieved a lot for our Party in the past, we must also remember that the Party is bigger than any individual.

'Nick did not adjust well to being given the honourary title of President and it soon became obvious that he was unable to work as an equal member of the team and alarmingly his behaviour became more erratic and disruptive.'
