Firemen are set to walk out across England and Wales for the first time in 10 years over changes to their pension scheme.

They will strike for four hours next Wednesday after almost 80 per cent of the Fire Brigades Union voted in favour of industrial action.

The unions warned that the strike could be the first of many – with another potentially on Bonfire Night.

Industrial action: Firefighters will down tools in their first nationwide strike for a decade next week in a row over pensions

Although there have been local 
disputes in recent years, it is the first time for a decade that firemen
have voted in favour of a national walkout.

Ministers
insisted that contingency plans were in place, and pledged that all 999
calls would be answered.

The service will be kept running by part-time 
fire crews who are not part of the FBU. In some areas, trained 
volunteers will be called upon to help out.

There
will be no Green Goddesses on the streets, as in previous strikes, 
because since 2004 it has been the role of fire and rescue authorities 
rather than government to provide cover in the event of industrial 
action.

Most of the Green Goddesses – Army appliances used to respond to
999 calls – have been sold to brigades in Africa.

Dangerous: The FBU say that it is 'ludicrous' to expect firefighters to work to the age of 60 before they receive a full pension (file picture)

Matt
Wrack, general secretary of the FBU, said the strike is ‘a warning 
shot’ to the Government.

‘Firefighters could not be more serious about  
protecting public safety and ensuring fair pensions,’ he said.

The 
dispute centres on the pensions paid to firemen over 50 who are forced 
to retire early after failing to meet the required fitness standards.

The union says thousands are threatened with the sack and paid a reduced
pension simply because they are getting older. It wants them to be paid
a full pension.

A 
government review found that more than half of firefighters between the 
ages of 50  and 54 cannot meet fire  and rescue service fitness 
standards for fighting fires, while two thirds of those beyond the age 
of 55 fail to meet the standards.

The retirement age is 60.

The FBU claims that its members pay some of the highest pension contributions in the public or private sector.

Fire
minister Brandon Lewis described the strike as ‘entirely unnecessary’ 
and that ‘robust’ contingency plans are in place.

‘The pension on offer 
to firefighters is one of the most generous public service pensions 
available,’ he said.

‘A 
firefighter who earns £29,000, and retires after a full career aged 60 
will get a £19,000 a year pension, rising to £26,000 with the state 
pension.

‘To get the same pension from a private scheme firefighters would have to contribute twice as much.’

Last week, the Trades Union Congress approved a ‘day of action’ on November 5.
