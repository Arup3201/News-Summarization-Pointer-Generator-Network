You will go to the ball: Isabelle prepares for the prom at her school with her new prosthetic leg

When Isabelle Papandronicou took the agonising decision to have a leg amputated, the teenager was determined to lead a normal life.

But there was one ambition that the 15-year-old’s new limb seemed destined to thwart.

Isabelle had her heart set on dressing up and attending her school prom.

However, her NHS prosthetic leg made dancing difficult and wearing high heels impossible.

Then she heard about an artificial leg designed to fit heeled shoes – and her parents Lisa and Sotiris began a fundraising campaign to buy her one in time for the prom.

The £5,600 leg meant Isabelle was able to attend the leavers’ ball at East Barnet School in North London last week wearing sparkly silver 3.5in heels and a flowing red dress – and could enjoy dancing with her friends.

‘Everyone was so surprised at how real it looked,’ she said.

‘Going to the prom was brilliant, it felt great to go all glammed up and look girlie because at parties everyone can normally wear heels but I have to wear flat shoes.

‘The whole thing was just completely new to me. I have never worn heels before.

‘Dancing was much easier with a heeled foot because with a flat  one you don’t have the right sort  of balance.

‘The only problem I had was  with my other leg, as my foot started to ache.’

Isabelle was 18 months old when she was diagnosed with a rare congenital disease that caused her right shinbone to be weak and fracture.

Years of operations failed to cure the condition, which meant her right leg was 3in shorter than the left.

Twelve months ago, she decided to have the leg amputated below the knee and was fitted with a conventional NHS prosthetic limb with a foot position that limited her to wearing flat shoes.

‘Before the amputation I was wearing a metal leg frame constantly and had to tighten pins to make [my leg] grow,’ said Isabelle.

‘I could only wear skirts or  shorts and I couldn’t even wear a pair of jeans.

‘I spoke to my family about the decision to have it amputated and I decided to go for it and haven’t looked back since.’

Her mother, a 47-year-old customer service assistant, said: ‘The NHS leg is great but they just don’t have the money for the cosmetic side of things that a 15-year-old girl in this position needs.’

She and her husband, a 46-year-old firefighter, raised the money for the leg to be fitted at a private clinic, Dorset Orthopaedic in Ringwood, Hampshire.

Experts took a cast of her left calf so they could sculpt the acrylic leg to look as natural as possible, and even colour-matched the silicone coating to her skin.

Paul Neve, a prosthetist at the clinic, said: ‘It looks unbelievably real and that was one of the main things Isabelle wanted as well as having the chance to wear a heel.

‘Heeled prosthetic legs can be designed to be at a range of heights and myself and Isabelle worked out the most suitable height for her.’

Mrs Papandronicou said: ‘The high-heeled leg is absolutely amazing. Isabelle can now go shopping for the shoes she wants to wear, not what she has to wear.

‘It’s so nice that she can now wear pretty shoes, she looked absolutely stunning at her prom and it has given her a real confidence boost.’
