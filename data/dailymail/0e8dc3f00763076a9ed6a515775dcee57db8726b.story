'Possessed': Liberal Democrat councillor Simon Arthur has been jailed for attacking his mother

A senior Liberal Democrat councillor who punched his frail 87-year-old mother and told her she would 'suffer in the afterlife' has been jailed.

Simon Arthur, 44, treated his mother Isabelle 'like a dog' and told her he hoped she would 'have an awful death', a court heard.

Mrs Arthur, a widow who uses a walking stick to get around, would even sleep in her car at times to avoid her violent son, magistrates were told.

The councillor, who was chosen to contest a seat for the Lib Dems in the 2010 General Election, was today sentenced to four months in prison after admitting attacking Mrs Arthur.

Arthur was arrested after a neighbour saw him assaulting his mother on the driveway of their home in Newton, near Swansea, South Wales, on July 21.

Prosecutor Sharon Anderson told Swansea Magistrates' Court: 'Mrs Arthur had been out for the day but said she was too scared to return home, choosing to wait in a car park.

'She regularly went to the car park to avoid going home and had even slept there overnight previously.

'Around 8pm she did go home and parked in the driveway but her son had locked all the doors to their home.

'At around 11.30pm he came out of the house and began the attack.'

Mrs Arthur gave details of the attack in a witness statement.

It read: 'He came over, opened the driver’s side door, grabbed hold of my hair and tried to pull me out of the car. It was like he was possessed.'

'He tried to grab me a second time shouting: “You’ll burn, you’ll suffer in the afterlife.”'

Magistrates heard that Mrs Arthur tried to make her way down the driveway to get help but her son grabbed her walking stick to block her path.

Ms Anderson said: 'Mrs Arthur fell to the ground and dragged herself along the floor.

'She crawled out of the drive and her son followed, eventually trying to pick her up but she told him to leave her alone.'

When police arrived and took Arthur into his kitchen, he opened a drawer and grabbed a knife, the court heard.

He lunged at Pc Greg Bowen, who avoided the blade and managed to disarm the councillor.

Mrs Arthur was opposed to criminal proceedings being brought against her son and asked police and social services to help him instead.

Her statement read: 'I now realise he will hurt me if he carries on - I don’t know what I have done to deserve this.

'I want him out of my house. I want him to get the help he needs.'

Mrs Arthur told police her son treated her like a dog, adding that she was terrified of him and 'living on eggshells'.

In her statement she said Arthur had never had a proper job and had always relied on her for financial support.

'He has a nasty temper and has got more controlling since my husband died 22 years ago,' she said.

'Simon’s behaviour escalated last year after my twin brother Peter died.

'He told me: “It should be you that’s gone, not Peter. I hope you have an awful death”.'

Mrs Arthur added: 'I try and let it go over my head but when it’s physical, I can’t excuse it.'

Magistrates were told Mrs Arthur was advised by social services to write a letter to her son, asking him to leave their home.

But he responded by laughing and throwing it away, the court heard.

Arthur admitted to police that he had punched his mother on a number of previous occasions.

When officers asked him to indicate the force he had used on a scale of one to ten, he replied: 'Two.'

Arthur, a councillor for the Newton ward on Mumbles Community Council, admitted common assault and assault by beating.

Magistrates imposed a restraining order on Arthur after hearing his mother no longer wants to share her home with him.

He was ordered to move out and only to visit on her instructions.

Eliot Griffiths JP told him: 'Your mother is now very much in charge and you have to do what she tells you to.'

The local branch of the Liberal Democrats has suspended Arthur and is expected to expel him permanently.
