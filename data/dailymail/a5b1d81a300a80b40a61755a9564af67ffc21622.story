Heartbreaking: Stephen Guillermo, 26 (pictured) was shot dead in his San Francisco apartment complex on Saturday morning after a night out drinking

A university student has been shot dead after a night out drinking when he accidentally returned home to the wrong apartment.

Stephen Guillermo, 26, apparently pressed the third floor instead of the fifth on the elevator and then tried to enter what he thought was the condominium he shared with his brother and sister.

But the apartment was owned by Amisi Sudi Kachepa, 68, who it is alleged shot him when he tried to force open the door early Saturday morning.

Kachepa, who later surrendered to police and was arrested, reportedly told people in the building that he blamed Guillermo for breaking the knob on the door of his unit.

The knob on the door was missing yesterday at the apartment in San Francisco, SFGate reported.

Marc Guillermo, the victim's brother, said he could not understand what had happened.

He said Mr Guillermo was studying international business at San Francisco State University, and worked both driving for the ride sharing service Lyft and selling Puma athletic shoes.

He had hoped to join the U.S. Foreign Service, he added.

'He's not aggressive or violent,' Mr Guillermo said. 'He's a quiet person.'

'It just doesn't fit," said Sharrmaine Guillermo, his sister, adding that her brother did not become hostile when he drank, and she cannot figure out how he would even start some sort of confrontation.

'Stephen is not the kind of guy who would do that.'

Mr Guillermo would talk through any confrontation and would not be combative, she said.

'We're all confused, we just can't understand how it could have happened,' she said.

'He was such a gentle, quiet guy - he's just not the type that would be violent or inspire that type of response,' said his cousin, Emil Guillermo, a columnist with AsianWeek.

He said that the shooting belied claims that San Francisco was a safe city.

'The older resident apparently felt he needed a gun to live in his urban apartment on Mission and 5th Street,' he wrote.

'This is how safe the city is when one only feels secure when armed and dangerous.

'That’s the situation that leaves an innocent 26-year-old dead.'

'Officers arrived on scene and located a shooting victim in an apartment. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene by medical personnel. Homicide investigators are actively investigating the incident.
