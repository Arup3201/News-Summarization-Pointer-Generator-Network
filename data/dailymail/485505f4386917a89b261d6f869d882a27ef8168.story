Hakim Berkani leaves his employment tribunal in London, where he claimed he was unfairly sacked as a parking attendant by NSL because he refused to issue large numbers of tickets

A parking warden with a conscience was sacked for refusing to issue large numbers of tickets to 'extract as much cash as possible' from motorists, a tribunal heard.

Hakim Berkani, 45, claims that fellow wardens referred to their company as 'Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves' and that there was 'severe pressure' to issue more than 10 parking tickets per shift.

Mr Berkani, who worked for Kensington and Chelsea Council's parking firm NSL, claims top-performing wardens were rewarded with 'plenty of favours in return.'

Bosses even cited one colleague as an 'excellent example' for issuing 35 tickets, known as PCNs (Penalty Charge Notice) in a single shift, and manager said it was 'good revenue for the Council and that everyone should generate the same revenue as him.'

Mr Berkani, of Wandsworth, south London, was sacked in February last year following more than three years' service after tipping off a driver who was about to be given a ticket by another warden.

NSL contract manager Paul Boxali told him in a letter: 'You informed the owner of the car that a PCN was being issued with apparent disregard for the safety and well-being of the issuing enforcement officer.'

However, Mr Berkani told a Central London Employment Tribunal: 'It soon became clear that it was commonly accepted amongst my work colleagues that the whole operation of Civil Parking Enforcement in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was dishonest and mainly designed to extract as much cash as possible, via both fair means or foul, from the motoring public.

'I have seen during the course of my employment...things which I would never imagined could exist in a modern country like England, which I have always understood and believed upheld and applied the law in a fair, open and even handed manner.'

He claims he saw two female colleagues reduced to tears after being berated by the management for not bringing back a sufficient number of PCNs.

He quickly came under 'severe pressure' to issue a minimum of 10 PCNs per shift, he claims, but was informed that 'ten PCN's per shift was a poor performance but was considered just about acceptable.''

He said: 'We were always told that double figures, i.e. 10 or more PCNs, was the minimum number that we should be aiming for on every shift.'

Later on, he said, it became 'common knowledge' that if they issued at a rate below 0.9 PCNs per hour that NSL would fire you.'

Even this reduced target was 'impossible to achieve in an entirely legal and honest manner' he said.

In December 2009, he came across an email from Emma Collins, a top NSL manager, stating: 'There are still a significant number of people issuing at a rate of below 0.9 per hour...We should not be uncomfortable about using the disciplinary process.'

He said: 'It seems that all NSL managers' primary aim is to make sure that a particular number of PCNs are issued and they don't really care just how the targets are hit.

'I really did not agree with these highly dodgy practices of issuing parking tickets while bypassing rules and regulations.'

Chelsea resident Alasdair Seton-Marsden, a former marketing director, has studied law so that he can represent Mr Berkani at the hearing.

A wealth of Chelsea residents and shop owners have also written statements to the tribunal in his support.

The Reverend Canon David Reindorp, of Chelsea Old Church, wrote: 'Mr Berkani was courteous and tactful and took enormous trouble to do his job...I always thought he was an object lesson in how to do a tricky job well...I was delighted to see him giving traffic wardens a good name.'

While Vincent Saladin, sales manager at Le Pascalou Food and Drink on Fulham Road, said: 'Thanks to Mr Berkani we have experienced some changes.

'All our customers suffer a lot less stress knowing that they have a 'timed' right to load their shopping without risking a fine.'

Mr Berkani is claiming unfair dismissal and interim relief for being a trade union representative.

The company denies the claims.

Nabil Hanafi, NSL spokesman said: 'NSL cannot comment on the specifics of this particular case which is being heard at an Employment Tribunal.

'We instruct all of our Civil Enforcement Officers (CEOs) to issue tickets according to clear rules and regulations. Neither NSL nor our officers have any incentive, financial or otherwise, linked to the issue of penalty charge notices and we are very strictly regulated to ensure any tickets issued are legitimate.

'Our staff perform an important public service, keeping the streets clear, traffic flowing and ensuring that all drivers have fair access to parking spaces.'
