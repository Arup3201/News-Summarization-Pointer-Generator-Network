Police arrested 17-year-old Will Campbell Monday for a mass shooting last month that injured 15 people inside a Miami restaurant hosting a teen club night.

Campbell is being charged with attempted murder after he fired point blank into a 15-year-old school rival's stomach at The Spot then shot into the crowd as he fled.

He will also be charged with one count of aggravated battery with a firearm for each of the 14 people he hit during his escape.

The Spot: The Caribbean restaurant in north Miami doubled as a nightclub, and was hosting a teen night when 15 patrons were shot

According to the NBC Miami, Campbell is speaking with police in the company of his mother, said Police Chief Manuel Orosa.

According to Orosa, bad blood from a fight at Norland Senior High School involving Campbell's friend and a 15-year-old spilled over into the club.

The Miami Herald reports that Campbell approached the other teen and, pulling out a weapon, shot him 'point blank in the stomach.'

The victim is in critical condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital.

Campbell left the club still holding his weapon, firing multiple shots into the crowd and striking 14 other club goers from ages 11 to 25.

The 17-year-old had a troubled past, having been kicked out of several schools in recent months.

Crime scene: The area around The Spot is taped off as emergency responders treat victims. Campbell escaped Sunday morning after the shooting, allegedly with the help of a driver 

At two schools Campbell had previously attended, he'd been in trouble for fighting, bringing a knife on school grounds and marijuana possession.

In 2013, he was arrested on a charge of resisting with violence.

Police said Campbell is currently booked as a juvenile, but that this status may change considering the circumstances of the crime.

Detectives are still looking for a get-away driver.

'We need to show people you cannot go into an establishment and shoot indiscriminately and get away with it,' Orosa said. 'A lot of innocent people were hit by bullets.'

Last week, the Spot's manager, Tiffany Johnson, 31, was arrested for distributing liquor without a license. 

The Spot is only licensed for beer and wine, and several liquor bottles were found behind the bar, though detectives are looking into whether any alcohol was served to minors.

The Caribbean restaurant is not licensed to operate as a club, though management has hosted events in the past months, with some Saturdays being dedicated to an all-ages 'teen night.'
