Two lucky motorists cheated serious injury today after a petrol station canopy collapsed on their cars.

The roof of the BP garage in Coalville, Leicestershire, was unable to withstand the torrential rainfall yesterday and gave way hitting two cars, a white Vauxhall Corsa and a black Ford.

Fortunately, both owners were paying for fuel when the collapse happened.

A spokesman for the fire brigade said: 'The internal structure of the forecourt canopy collapsed onto two cars at a petrol station.

'Fortunately there were no persons trapped in the cars or injured.'
