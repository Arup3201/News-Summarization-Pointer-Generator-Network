A Florida woman who allegedly stole a credit card and willingly posed for a photo with the pocketed plastic was arrested on Tuesday.

Mashana Harris, 26, was nabbed by police at an Ocala motel and has been charged with felony fraud for stealing a card belonging to 74-year-old Josephine Lupo.

The Smoking Gun reports that back in July Harris allegedly stole a card from Walmart and used it to rack up a $500 bill.

Harris supposedly illegally bought goods at Family Dollar and Looking Good Beauty Supply shop.

After seeing a hefty false transaction, Police contacted Looking Good Beauty Supply and spoke with the clerk Addel Kassem who 'did not feel comfortable' with the $430 purchase when it occurred so he asked Harris to take a photo with the credit card. She obliged.

The credit card scam was reported after the 74-year-old victim saw several false transactions on her credit card and went to the police.

This is not the first time Harris has been arrested.

Her record points to arrests for larceny, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest.
