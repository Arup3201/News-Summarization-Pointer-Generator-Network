The expectations of a nation are resting on their shoulders, but the Brazil squad certainly aren't showing any signs of bowing to pressure.

The Samba stars lived up to their name by creating a party atmosphere on their personalied plane with Willian taking lead on the tambourine and Neymar bobbing along.

It will be all systems go on Thursday, though, when the host nation declare the World Cup open against Croatia in Sao Paulo.

Team spirit, undoubtedly, appears high in the Brazil camp as they prepare to try and add a sixth star to their chest.

And
 their form isn't bad, either. Brazil thumped Panama 4-0 on Tuesday in 
their pre-World Cup friendly with Neymar, Dani Alves, Hulk and Willian 
all on the score sheet.

Brazil were jetting off to face Serbia in their final friendly before the world's greatest tournament gets underway.
