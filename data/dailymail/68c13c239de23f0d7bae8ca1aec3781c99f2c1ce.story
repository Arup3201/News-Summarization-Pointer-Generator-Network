Police today appealed for help to find the culprit behind an 'elaborate hoax' after two suspicious devices forced them to close down parts of a city centre.

Parts of Canterbury, Kent, were evacuated last night after a suspected bomb was found near a railway line and a fire was started in a branch of Marks & Spencer.

Last night police confirmed that the suspicious device in a rucksack including a black cylinder attached to a mobile phone was not an explosive device.

Assistant Chief Constable Andy Adams, of Kent Police, said the fire had also involved a hoax explosive device.

'Yesterday afternoon we took two 
calls, one about a suspicious device on the railway line near Old Dover 
Road shortly after 4.20pm, and one about a small fire in Marks and 
Spencer shortly before 5.20pm,' he said.

'We responded immediately to both calls with our colleagues from other emergency services.

'I am now in a position to say that 
the first suspicious package on the railway line has been checked by 
Army bomb disposal experts and is not - as has been reported - an 
explosive device.

'We are satisfied it is in fact a hoax package designed to appear like a device.

'Bomb disposal experts have also 
checked a package associated with the fire in the baby changing room on 
the second floor of Marks and Spencer. This has also proved to be a hoax
device.'

Mr Adams added that while dealing with the 
incidents police received a number of other calls relating to suspicious
activity including one at Kent Cricket Ground.

The ground, which is in the city, 
yesterday saw India take on Kent but Mr Adams said there was not 
believed to have been any direct threat to the Indian cricket team.

Speaking at a local police station, Mr
Adams added: 'I'm happy that the two incidents must be connected and 
the reason that I say that [is] in my 26 years of policing experience I 
can't remember an incident where we've had one bomb hoax followed by 
another in quick succession, so I'd be extremely surprised if they were 
unconnected.

'Our prime focus at this moment in 
time is to gather every bit of information that we can, identify a 
suspect or suspects and then do everything we can to lock them up.

'Bomb hoax is a serious offence and carries a weighty sentence.'

Residents and workers near both 
incidents - near the railway line and around the heart of the shopping 
district - were evacuated yesterday afternoon.

Kent Fire and Rescue Service was 
called to Marks and Spencer in St George's Street after staff discovered
a small fire in the baby changing area on the second floor. It was 
quickly put out and the store was evacuated.

St George's Street and part of Old 
Dover Road, where the suspicious package was found, were closed while 
the bus station, Rose Square and Marlowe Arcade were evacuated.

A large number of residents and shop 
and office workers were ordered to leave homes and premises inside the 
police cordons. Police vehicles, fire engines and ambulances were parked
on standby in several parts of the city.

Kent Police also set up a specialist 
command team of senior officers to deal with the incident headed by Mr Adams.

He said that at the incident's 
height around 100 officers were deployed, along with colleagues from 
British Transport Police and Army bomb disposal experts.

Martin Hayner, 39 director of PME electrical services, was working with others in a shoe shop when he had to evacuate.

He said: 'We thought there was 
something going because of all the emergency sirens but we didn't take 
it seriously until we looked out at 5pm and the city centre was 
deserted.

'We went out into the backyard and a police officer asked us what we were doing.

'He said we had to leave immediately and go outside the police cordon.

'We've been here since but no one will tell us what's happening.

'We need to go back to get our tools so we can't leave because we need them for a job in Somerset tomorrow.

'But the police have said it might be cordoned off all night.'

Trains were stopped between Canterbury
East and Dover Priory and a replacement bus service was offered to 
stranded commuters. Police urged the public to avoid the city centre and
drivers to find other routes.

Parts of St George's Street and Old Dover Road remain cordoned off today as police focus their investigations there.

Canterbury East train station also 
remains closed but train services were expected to return to normal by 
midday, according to police.
