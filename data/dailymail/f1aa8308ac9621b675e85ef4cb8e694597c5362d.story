What  do Jesus, Napoleon and the prophet Muhammad all have in common?

They are the top three most significant historical figures, according to new analysis of online encyclopedia Wikipedia’s three million pages.

Computer scientists Steven Skiena and Charles B Ward have studied the Wiki pages of more than 800,000 people to come up with a list of the world’s most important figures.

Jesus is the most famous person in history according to a software programme that scours the internet to rank people's importance

Using a ‘ranking algorithm’, the pair 
looked at the length of a person’s Wikipedia page, how many times it was
 read and the number of links from the pages of other major figures.

Jesus
 came out at number one, while French Emperor was ranked at number two 
and the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, was at number three.

The
 rankings are also compared against public opinion polls, Hall of Fame 
voting records, sports statistics, and the prices of paintings and 
autographs.

Lasting impression: William Shakespeare was in fourth place while Napoleon was deemed the second most important person in history

Other figures who ranked among the top ten include William Shakespeare, Adolf Hitler and Aristotle.

The
 list appears in a new book called ‘Who’s Bigger: Where Historical 
Figures Really Rank’ and also includes separate rankings for artists and
 literary figures.

The top 
pre-20th century artist is Leonardo da Vinci, with Michelangelo at 
number two and Raphael at number three. Vincent van Gogh topped the list
 for the modern-era artists with Picasso second and Monet third.

The highest ranked literary figure is Shakespeare, followed by Charles Dickens and then Mark Twain.

Queen Elizabeth I was the highest ranking woman in 13th place, just two behind her father Henry VIII

Poor show: David Cameron was found languishing in 1,483rd place
