The Boomers' World Cup nightmare has worsened after basketball's governing body opened an investigation into the controversial loss to Angola in which Australia was accused of tanking.

A day after a surprise defeat to Turkey sent them out of the tournament in Spain, Australia learned they could face disciplinary action from FIBA over the manner of last week's loss to Angola.

The Boomers rested several key players and let a 15-point lead slip in the third quarter against Africa's No.1 nation in their final group game in Gran Canaria to go down by 91-83.

The 91-83 loss meant Australia could not face the all-conquering USA team until the semi-finals but Boomers head coach Andrej Lemanis rejected suggestions they lost on purpose.

The alleged strategy proved irrelevant after a 65-64 loss to Turkey in their sudden-death round of 16 game on Sunday, but Basketball Australia must now formally defend the performance against Angola or face possible sanctions such as a fine.

'The on-court behaviour displayed by Australia in that game generated huge disappointment by basketball fans and experts,' FIBA said in a statement on Monday.

'It is widely suspected that Australia lost that game in order to avoid having to face the reigning world champions USA until the semi-finals.

'Basketball Australia has an opportunity to state its case before FIBA decides whether and to what extent disciplinary sanctions shall be imposed.'

Slovenian NBA star Goran Dragic was among the fiercest critics of Australia's performance, taking to Twitter after the match to urge FIBA to take action.

'Basketball is a beautiful sport, there is no room for fixing the game like today Australia vs Angola!! @FIBA should do something about that!' he posted.

With a place in the knockout stages already secured, Lemanis rested his two best performing players of the tournament, star centre Aron Baynes and sharp-shooting veteran Joe Ingles, while giving fellow starters Matthew Dellavedova and David Andersen less than four minutes each.

When challenged post-match on whether his side had contested the match in the spirit of the game, Lemanis was defiant, arguing the heavy tournament schedule demanded he rest his players before the next stage of competition.

'We always, as Australians, compete the right way,' he said.

Pressed on how some people would view the loss Lemanis said: 'People will make up their own minds.

'There's always going to be speculators. I can't control what people think.'

Injured Australian star Andrew Bogut hit out at FIBA's comments and questioned the governing body's consistency.

'So u can naturalize a plyer who has nver stepped foot in a country, but you cant rest players in a game 2 better a draw 4 youself? Ok @fiba,' Bogut wrote on Twitter.

'Love it or hate it I have seen this and much more occur many times @fiba tournaments I have played in since 2002 (incl. Juniors).'

Despite missing their two best players, NBA stars Patty Mills and Bogut, Australia had been optimistic of challenging for a first ever World Cup medal.

The Boomers were on course for their first quarter-final appearance in 20 years, leading Turkey by six points with just over a minute to play in Barcelona on Sunday night.

However, some poor decision-making allowed Turkey back into the game and Emir Preldzic buried a three-pointer with five seconds remaining to give the reigning silver medallists a famous win.

Basketball Australia is yet to make comment on FIBA's investigation.

Lemanis said suggestions of tanking were ridiculous and defended Australia as a nation that competes in the interest of fair play.

'We always, as Australians, compete the right way,' he said.   

When asked whether he accepted that some Australians would view the loss with an air of scepticism, Lemanis said: 'People will make up their own minds.'

'There's always going to be speculators. I can't control what people think.' 

The Boomers were chasing a fourth straight victory for the first time in World Cup history, and for most of the match were cruising before the wheels fell off.

Guard Chris Goulding shot a team-high 22 points as the Boomers opened up a 15-point buffer.

It was also an opportunity to see highly-rated No.5 NBA draft pick Dante Exum in action, and the 19-year-old didn't disappoint - scoring 12 points and handing out six assists in his 31 minutes on court.

Despite fielding a second string team Australia was still the heavily backed favourites at $1.17

But an Angolan charge, led by dynamic young star Yanick Moreira's outstanding 38-point display, started midway through the third quarter and they cut the lead to just two at the final break.

The onslaught continued thereafter as Australia carelessly gave up the ball, committing 18 turnovers, and played lacklustre defence as the clock wound down in the eight-point loss - prompting the tanking calls.

Sports betting agency Sportsbet.com.au refunded $125,500 in bets placed on the Boomers to win the match in light of the allegations.

The side was an unbackable $1.17 to win with Angola the $5.20 outsiders.

'Punters bet on the Aussies in good faith not knowing they would be resting a few of their guns and giving their reserves a go, so we think it's only fair that they get their money back to enjoy over the weekend,'  the agency's Shaun Anderson said.

Former Boomer Shane Heal defended the tactics and said Australia were well within their right to want the best chance of winning a maiden medal. 

'[It is] un Australian not to give yourself the best chance to medal,' he wrote on Twitter.

'No medals given on pool placings. Pathway to final 4 is the key.' 

'There's still games to be played that will determine the outcome of the pool.

When pressed about  allegations of premeditated tanking tactics post match, Lemanis responded:   

'Nobody likes losing. (The loss) doesn't guarantee us third spot

He said the team had 'no control over that game.' 'That was always the case coming in.' 

Securing third spot would mean Australia would avoid a quarter-final show down against America and conveniently put them in a position to challenge for a maiden medal at the tournament. 

Former Australian basketball great Shane Heal said  if tanking was on the agenda, it was something that he supported in an effort for the Boomers to win a maiden world cup medal.

'[It is] un Australian not to give yourself the best chance to medal,' he wrote on Twitter.

'No medals given on pool placings. Pathway to final 4 is the key.'

But most shared a different view to Heal on social media - with one Twitter user comparing the match to Australia's infamous underarm bowling scandal.

The strategy employed by the then captain Greg Chappel gave New Zealand no hope of winning when his brother Trevor bowled an underarm ball on the final play of the match.
