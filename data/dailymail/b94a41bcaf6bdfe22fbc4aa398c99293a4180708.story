A football mascot has lost his job after nearly two decades  - because he became 'too thin' after losing weight to combat type 2 diabetes.

Lenny Berry, 59, has dressed up in character for Bradford City FC since 1994. But after he shed seven stone bosses told him his figure ‘no longer matched the original concept’ of the mascot 'City Gent'.

The character - based on a former chairman - is rotund, teams a club strip with a bowler hat and briefcase, interacts with fans at matches and appears at charity functions.

But Mr Berry has now finished his duties after he was diagnosed with diabetes and dropped to ten stone.

The club offered him a 'Sumo-style' suit to get round the problem, but the life-long Bradford City fan refused.

Mr Berry, of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, said: ‘I'm absolutely gutted. I am a grown man and this is something I have cried over. I used to have supporters chant things at me, like “who ate all the pies?”

‘I used to get them going and then grab my belly. I play the part of the mascot though, through my face and my eyes. I've always had a good rapport with fans.

‘I've been through the Bradford City fire. I've been through everything down there. I don't want the club getting hurt, I love the club. If you cut me open I'd be claret and amber.

‘It's not the team and it's not the club, but I am disappointed with the way it's been dealt with.

‘Over the years I've done a lot of fundraising. I've taken part in mascot races and other events.

‘I will still be at Bradford City as a season-ticket holder, but it is really sad.’

Mr Berry has been a Bantams' fan since the age of seven and started working at the club selling cushions aged 14.

In 1994 he took over as the mascot City 
Gent, a large character modelled on former club chairman - the late 
Stafford Heginbotham.

However, the textiles worker said he received a letter from the club about his future in the role in mid-July.

He said: ‘In a meeting I asked why it wasn't brought up six years ago when I first lost the weight. They said they knew about my health issues.

‘Obviously I've lost a lot of weight. I 
used to be 17 and a half stone, whereas I'm now around ten and a half. I
 lost it in about 18 months after I found out I had diabetes.’

Club director Roger Owens said the 
issue of club mascots had been discussed during a board meeting and it 
had agreed ‘action needed to be taken’.

He
 said: ‘In the case of The City Gent, the main issue was his physical 
appearance, which was much changed from the original concept of the 
then-chairman, the late Stafford Heginbotham, who styled the City Gent 
on himself.

‘We agreed that action needed to be taken. It was also agreed that Lenny be formally contacted, by letter, to put our various points to him and to suggest that the club obtain a Sumo-type suit with character head piece to represent the Gent.

‘The Football League had told us at the 
time of the League Two Play-Off final that only animal or human mascots 
were now appropriate if they wore an anonymous headset.

‘Lenny was given a deadline to respond, which was extended and then not complied with by our meeting on Friday.

‘Lenny advised me that he would cease his role as City Gent with immediate effect.

‘The board has now decided that as we are adequately covered by Billy Bantam and that the City Gent name lives on in the excellent club fanzine, we will not replace The City Gent as a mascot.’

Mr Owen added: 'I had also explained to Lenny that he would cease to be part of the mascots match-day ground tour because of the size of his suit and as such he would cease to be paid and have his taxation affairs dealt with by the club.

'Lenny asked about the continuation of his appearance at charity events and he was told that these would cease as the club had not been given a full fix on his activities and we cannot have possible conflict.

'At that point Lenny advised me that he would cease his role as City Gent with immediate effect.'
