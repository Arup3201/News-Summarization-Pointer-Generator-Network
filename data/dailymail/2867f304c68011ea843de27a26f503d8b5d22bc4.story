Tottenham are willing to let Benoit Assou Ekotto leave on a free transfer. 

The Cameroon international has been pushed down the pecking order by the arrival of Ben Davies from Swansea while Danny Rose has also signed a new long-term deal. 

Assou-Ekotto has one year left on his contract but Tottenham are willing to cut their losses as they streamline their squad.

The 30-year-old spent last season on loan at QPR as the Hoops earned promotion to the Premier League with a 1-0 victory over Derby in last season's play-off final.
