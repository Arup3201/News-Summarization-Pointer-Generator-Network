Some men might be considered crazy for baiting a 719-pound alligator to come at them, but it's worked out well for Clark Woodsby.

The Lakeland, Florida man is showing off his latest trophy after forcing the gator into submission in a private phosphate pit.

'We called him in with an electronic call,' he said. 'This gator heard it from across the lake, and it came bee-lining right toward me.'
