The high school friend of a missing Colorado teen who gave a television interview begging for help in the search, was arrested for the 19-year-old woman's murder on Thursday.

Lea Chali Porter, 19, of Pueblo was reported missing by her mother on June 5 and was last seen driving to 23-year-old friend Christopher Waide's apartment after getting into a fight with her boyfriend.

In the wake of her disappearance, Waide gave a television interview saying Porter left his house in the middle of the night and he hadn't seen her since, though her car never left his apartment's parking lot.  

From concerned friend to number one suspect: 23-year-old Christopher Waide (right) was arrested on Thursday after confessing to killing Denver woman Lea Porter, 19. Before he was arrested, Waide gave a television interview in which he asked for help searching for the missing girl

Missing: 19-year-old Lea Porter was first reported missing on June 5 by her mother. She was last seen driving to Waide's apartment after getting into a fight with her boyfriend

But after being confronted by Porter's brother and boyfriend in a recorded conversation Thursday, Waide copped to killing the missing girl and dumping her body.

Booked: Waide is currently being held without bond at the Adams County Jail on charges of first-degree murder and sexual assault. His first court appearance is scheduled for Monday

Police say Waide was always a suspect in the girl's disappearance but that they didn't have enough evidence to arrest him.

While he was free, Waide gave an interview to CBS Denver reporters, in which he voiced apparent concern over his missing friend.

'Well, overall I just want her to be safe,' he said in the taped interview. 'I don’t have very many friends but the friends I do have I’m very loyal to. So even losing one is a heavy blow for me. I tried texting her. I’ve tried calling her. I’ve left her some messages on Facebook and haven’t heard anything back from her.'

During the interview, the reporter noted that Waide looked on edge, and he said the investigation was putting him outside his comfort zone.

'It’s definitely intimidating because I’m more of a person to listen and not speak. So with everyone trying to get in touch with me and asking me what happened, it’s been a shock to my system,' Waide said.

In addition to the television interview, Waide wrote several posts on Facebook raising awareness of Porter's disappearance.

The last post was dated June 9 and said: 'Lea please come back to us'.

Porter and Waide both attended Florence High School together and had recently connected on Facebook. She graduated in 2013 and was planning a move to Denver, and Waide promised to help.

Waide initially told investigators that he and Porter got into a fight when she came over to his apartment, after he confronted her about having heroin. Porter's mother says she wasn't aware her daughter struggled with substance abuse.

Crime scene: On Friday, police cordoned off Waide's apartment and carried out several brown bags of evidence

But Waide said she left after that and hadn't heard from her.

Waide changed his story on Thursday when Porter's brother and boyfriend approached him at his apartment.

He took them to a nearby park where he confessed to murdering Porter and even went into detail about how he killed her.

The two men had 911 recording the conversation the whole time and Waide was arrested that evening.

Police say he is being 'cooperative' and even 'helping with finding the body'.

On Friday, investigators removed several brown bags of evidence from Waide's apartment, as well as trash bins in the apartment complex. They also cordoned off an area near a landfill.

'We have some good leads as to where Lea's at so we want to bring her home to her family,' Westminster Police Department spokesman Cheri Spottke told the Denver Post.

Waide is being held without bond at the Adams County Jail on charges of first-degree murder and sexual assault. His first court appearance is scheduled for Monday.
