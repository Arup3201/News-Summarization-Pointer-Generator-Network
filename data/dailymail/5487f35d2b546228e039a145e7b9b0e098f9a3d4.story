A new kind of bond between atoms found only in the crushingly intense magnetic fields of white dwarf stars could unlock new secrets of quantum physics.

The find - a 'third kind' of bond between atoms, unknown on Earth - could also unlock the secrets of ultra-powerful new computers.

The find rewrites the rules of the 
universe - adding a third kind of bond after the 'ionic' and 'covalent' 
bonds learned by schoolchildren.

A quantum computer would use quibits 
which, based on theories of quantum physics, would be able to exist in 
more than one state at once - a zero, one and all values in between.

A quantum computer would therefore be
able to perform calculations in parallel, arriving at the result much, 
much faster than regular computers.

However,
working out how to store and manipulate quibits has been a major 
stumbling block in efforts to develop a quantum computer.

The
problem is that in order for a quibit to exist, it must be isolated 
from its surroundings to stop it being destroyed in a process called 
decoherence.

But in order to use a quibit to make calculations, it must be able to interact with other information.

White dwarf stars have magnetic fields 
10,000 times stronger than the strongest fields on Earth - and the 
strange chemical bonds occur within the fields.

White dwarfs are the final stage of life of stars like our Sun - once the thermonuclear furnace inside a star 'burns out'.

Karl Lange and colleagues at the 
Univrsity of Oslo were studying white dwarf stars when they found that 
hydrogen atoms were not behaving like they should.

Now scientists have pushed the limit of how long information can be stored in solid state, outside a vacuum.

The bonds could not ever be recreated on Earth - the magnetism would destroy the apparatus used to recreate it.

One of the lead reesarchers told Nature News: ‘The experimental apparatus would cease to be an apparatus in these extreme conditions!’

But the increased understanding of how atoms interact could lead to new discoveries in quantum physics - and even to new generations of quantum computer.
