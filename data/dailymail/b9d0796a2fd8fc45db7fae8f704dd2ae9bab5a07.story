Expert's view: Ben Broadbent brushed aside concerns that an increase in the base rate from 0.5 per cent could hurt millions of homeowners

A leading Bank of England economist has hit out at fears the Government’s Help to Buy scheme could create a new housing bubble.

Interest rates would have to rise ‘a fair amount’ before homeowners in the scheme run into trouble, he insisted.

Ben Broadbent, who sits on the Bank committee which sets interest rates, brushed aside concerns that an increase in the base rate from 0.5 per cent could hurt millions of homeowners.

There are fears many borrowers are already financially stretched and economists have warned Help to Buy could fuel another housing boom and bust.

Those taking advantage of Help to Buy face having to pay interest rates of around 5 per cent on their loans.

When mortgage rates do rise, they may be unable to afford the higher monthly instalments and, in a worst case scenario, could face repossession.

Mr Broadbent, a former senior economist at Goldman Sachs said: ‘I think there is a fair amount they could go up before borrowers got into great difficulty, I must say.’

He told Sky News that the ‘numbers entering this scheme are relatively low and although interest rates will at some point start to rise, it is worth remembering how low a level we are starting from’.

But critics of Help to Buy slammed Mr Broadbent’s remarks as ‘complacent’ and pointed out the Bank has a poor track record at predicting housing market bubbles.

‘The idea borrowers on Help to Buy could withstand a rise in rates is very complacent. The Bank is not very good at spotting housing market bubbles ahead of time,’ said City economist Dr Tim Morgan.

‘I don’t like Help to Buy at all. It is the old story of pumping up the economy by persuading people to borrow.

‘This is a bad way to run the economy and I am fearful for people who take up this offer. Houses are pretty highly priced and they will have to pay a higher rate from the start, of around 5 per cent interest. When they are paying that much, it would not take much of a rise to tip them over the edge.’

The Help to Buy initiative allows borrowers to buy a home of up to £600,000 with a deposit of just 5 per cent.

A government guarantee will cover the remaining 15 per cent, meaning taxpayers could be faced with a multi-billion-pound bill if borrowers who use the scheme fall into difficulty.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney has indicated interest rates are unlikely to rise until 2016, but they could go up sooner if unemployment falls significantly or inflation starts to run out of control.

George Osborne has put in place measures to soothe fears he is stoking a new housing bubble through Help to Buy.

The Chancellor last month gave the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee a mandate to review the scheme each year to check it is not posing a risk to the economy.

Ray Boulger, a mortgage expert with broker John Charcol, said: ‘If interest rates rise quite quickly it would cause problems.’

But he added that those on Help to Buy may not end up with the worst problems.

‘The ones most at risk are those who struggled to get a cheap rate without going through Help to Buy. If you are on Help to Buy you will be used to paying 5 per cent now.

‘Then in a couple of years time the value of your property may have gone up and you will have paid some of the mortgage off, so you should be able to shop around for a lower rate. It is those who can only manage on a very cheap rate that could be in trouble.’

Marian Bell, a former member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, said: ‘I have doubts about whether the way forward is for people to take on more debt. I wonder whether the Government should be taking on that risk on to its books.’
