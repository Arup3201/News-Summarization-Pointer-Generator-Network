A man who exposed his genitals to his de facto partners nine-year-old daughter and bought her sex toys has been handed an 18 month suspended prison sentence.

The 54-year-old Canberra man was sentenced on Wednesday in the ACT Supreme Court, after previously pleading not guilty to an act of indecency in the presence of a child in September.

Justice Richard Refshauge acquitted the man of 13 other charges, including sexual assault and other indecent acts, reports Canberra Times.

According to the hearing, the man showed his genitals to the girl in 2011 when they were watching a film and she asked him about the meaning of a scene referring to sexual climaxing.

The man reportedly exposed himself as a sexual education lesson to answer how a man reaches an orgasm.

He was also punished for buying a golden vibrator and giving it to the girl as a present in 2012.

The court heard the girl told the man she did not need it, so he left it in his bedside draw in case she changed her mind.

He was also punished for showing pornography to the girl on his laptop while she was at his home in 2012.

In the hearing the man said he never forced the girl to watch it, but admitted he did posses pornographic material.

Mr Refshauge claimed the man did not recognise the gravity of his behaviour, and in turn that he needed to be punished

The girl also secretly recorded a conversation with the man on her mobile phone, in which he claimed he was worried the girl was upset he was sleeping with her mother.Â 

The man had claimed the conversation was part of an ongoing joke between the pair.

Mr Refshauge claimed the man did not recognise the gravity of his behaviour, and in turn that he needed to be punished.

Along with the sentence, the man was given a three year good behaviour bond and directed to complete 100 hours of community service, as well as being required to complete the ACT Corrective Services sex offender program.
