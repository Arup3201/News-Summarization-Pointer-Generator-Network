Bill Clinton has claimed his wife isn't out of touch with ordinary Americans after the former First Lady claimed to have been 'dead broke' when leaving the White House.

As the former first couple appeared at an event to talk about the gap between rich and poor on Tuesday, Clinton was forced to defend his wife's recent comments.

With Hillary expected to make a 2016 presidential bid, her husband was at pains to point out that the couple understood the economic plight of many families, despite their millions.

Defense: After Hillary Clinton's claims that she struggled after leaving the White House, Bill claimed she wasn't out of touch

Former President Bill Clinton discusses income inequality with David Gregory of NBC during a Clinton Foundation event on Tuesday

The couple appeared on Tuesday at the 
annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative America. At the event 
the former president said his wife was committed to addressing income 
inequality.

During
 his appearance Clinton talked about ways to reduce the gap between rich
 and poor - a potent issue in the Democratic party.

He and Hillary also discussed how to harness corporate and non-profit know-how to hire and mentor struggling young workers.

In an on-stage interview with NBC's 
David Gregory, Clinton said his family's post-presidential wealth had 
not diminished Hillary Clinton's understanding of the economic plight of
 many U.S. families.

'She's not out of touch,' Mr Clinton 
said, noting that in law school his future wife sought legal assistance 
for the poor and later advocated for paid leave for new mothers during 
the 1970s.

In an interview earlier this month on ABC Hillary claimed the family was 'dead broke' when her husband's presidential term came to an end in 2001.

'We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,' she said.

'We
 had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece 
together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's 
education. You know, it was not easy.'

The Clintons are now the wealthiest living family to have left the White House, with Bill worth an estimated $38 million.

Republicans
 have seized on Hillary's remarks and her comments in other interviews, 
pointing to the millions of dollars the family has earned since the end 
of Clinton's presidency.

More
 than two years before the next presidential election, GOP officials 
have sought to undermine Hillary Clinton's standing with working-class 
families who have been supportive of the family's political campaigns in
 the past.

If she runs for 
president, Republicans say Mrs Clinton could be vulnerable to charges of
 being a Washington insider insulated by private jets and six-figure 
speaking fees at a time when many Americans struggle.

The
 tactic could represent a payback of sorts after Democrats portrayed 
Republican Mitt Romney as a plutocrat during the 2012 presidential 
campaign.

During the 
interview, the ex-president told Gregory that his family's 
personal wealth was the 'wrong debate' and the focus should be on how 
political leaders address 'the central challenge of our time which is 
the demise of the American dream'.

With
 the gap between the rich and poor on the minds of many Americans, Bill 
Clinton said most Americans do not resent someone doing well 
financially.

'I think they resent it if they're not getting a fair deal,' he said.

He
 also said the couple visit their local grocery store on weekends like 
anyone else. 'We talk to people in our town. We know what's going on,' 
he said.

Hillary Clinton
 did not address the debate over the family's wealth at the meeting, but
 announced projects to create job opportunities for young people.

The initiatives - by companies such as The Gap, JPMorgan Chase and Marriott - train and hire young people.

The
 project, called Job One, is to help young people age 16-24 who are out 
of school and unemployed. Students preparing for the workforce in the 
aftermath of the recession have faced persistently high unemployment 
levels at rates about twice the national average.

'For
 those who don't get a college education or even high school, most doors
 just won't open, no matter how hard they knock,'the former first lady 
said.

A longtime child 
advocate, Clinton also announced projects aimed at promoting brain 
development and literacy for babies and toddlers.

The
 event took on the air of a Clinton alumni association, with several 
former members of Clinton's White House team in attendance, including 
former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and former Clinton economic 
adviser Gene Sperling.

Debt: Clinton recently claimed that when she left the White House in 2001 the family were 'dead broke'

An
 afternoon news conference put Mr Clinton alongside longtime labor 
allies such as AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and Randi Weingarten, 
president of the American Federation of Teachers union.

Yet
 even in a roomful of Clinton admirers, the debate got spirited at 
times. During a panel discussion on economic justice, Mr Clinton and 
former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina - an ex-adviser to Romney - 
tangled over the merits of raising the minimum wage and the role of 
government in the economy.

When Fiorina suggested the Obama administration was crushing the coal industry in West Virginia, Clinton interjected.

'Who had the smallest government workforce since Eisenhower? Me. That's right. You declared the era of big government over,' Fiorina said.

'Yeah, but I didn't declare the era of weak government that had nobody at home at the SEC before the financial crisis,' Clinton said to roars of approval, referencing complaints that the Securities and Exchange Commission failed to effectively police Wall Street.
