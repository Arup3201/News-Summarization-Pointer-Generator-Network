The NHS has spent more than 
£30million on taxis for patients in the past three years because of a 
shortage of specially equipped transport, it has been revealed.

Patient transport services - provided
 free to those who are too ill or unable to travel to and from hospitals
 such as those with broken limbs - are mainly run by ambulance trusts.

They are normally equipped with medical supplies such as oxygen and driven by trained crews.

But a Freedom of Information request 
has revealed the extent of taxi use - at great cost to the taxpayer and 
potential risk to the patient.

Private hire: Ambulance trusts are regularly paying to transport ill patients by taxi

The figures from ambulance trusts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were revealed by the BBC.

Health chiefs insisted the practice was not putting patients at risk, but admitted they were trying to cut the use of taxis amid worries they were not providing value for money.

The North West Ambulance Service spent the most on taxis - £9.9million since April 2008, on more than 500,000 journeys.

Some trusts also provided information on the most costly taxi journeys they had paid for.

These included two fares in excess of £700, one for a 184-mile journey from Cambridgeshire to Bristol when a patient was discharged from Papworth Hospital, while the second was for a 151-mile trip from Chase Farm Hospital in north London to Shrewsbury, Shropshire.

Patient transport services - provided 
free to those who are too ill or unable to travel to and from hospitals -
 are mainly run by ambulance trusts, although private firms are used in 
some places.

The findings revealed a number of very expensive taxi journeys:

£700+ for a 184-mile journey from Cambridgeshire to Bristol

£700+ for a 151-mile trip from Chase Farm Hospital, in north London, to Shrewsbury, Shropshire

£670.86 for a 290-mile journey from St Cross General Hospital in Rugby to a nursing home in Falmouth, Cornwall,

£600 for a 262-mile journey from Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Greenwich, London, to Hartlepool

Other costly taxi journeys included a £670.86 fare for a 290-mile journey from St Cross General Hospital in Rugby to a nursing home in Falmouth, Cornwall, by West Midlands ambulance bosses.

Another £600 was paid for a 262-mile journey from Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Greenwich to Hartlepool by London's ambulance service.

The services rely on specially adapted vehicles - normally minibuses equipped with basic medical supplies such as oxygen - staffed by trained crews to ferry patients around.

For those who do not need any medical assistance, official ambulance trust cars can be used to drive them. However, if neither of these options are available patients have to be ferried in private taxis.

Only the South East Coast Ambulance Trust has avoided paying anything out to taxis in the past three years, while London has reduced its reliance on them to fewer than 100 journeys a year.

The figures show that all other ambulance trusts use taxis on a regular basis.

Sara Gorton, from Unison, said: 'There may be occasions where it is unavoidable, but while these are not patients who have dialled 999, there will be times when they will need someone with more skills and training than just how to drive.

'But our concerns about patient transport services go wider than use of taxis. There are big differences in the way that patient transport is provided and what standards are kept to in different areas.'

Increasingly, services are being outsourced to private firms which means that competition is based on costs, and standards are being driven down. This also means it's harder to find out what is happening.

But Delwyn Wray, the director of patient transport services at North West Ambulance Trust and vice-chairman of the National Patient Transport Service Group, said while there was concern about taxi use, it was on value-for-money grounds rather than safety.

He said: 'Anyone needing medical help in any way would not go by taxis.

'I think there will always be a need for them at times, but each service needs to look at how they are using them and whether there is a more efficient and better way of transporting patients.

'That is what we are gearing up to in the North West.'

The Department of Health said decisions about how to transport patients were the responsibility of local NHS chiefs. Data for Scotland was not available.
