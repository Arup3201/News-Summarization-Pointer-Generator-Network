Norwich have confirmed they are investigating claims of racial abuse during their Sky Bet Championship clash with Wolves at Molineux on Sunday.

The Norfolk club have received numerous complaints from supporters following an incident in the visiting end as the Canaries went down 1-0 in their first competitive match since relegation from the Barclays Premier League.

Norwich have passed the information on to police and stated any fan found to be guilty would face a lifetime ban from attending matches at Carrow Road.

Turning point: Wolves scored the only goal of the game to condemn Norwich City to defeat at Molineux but the club are investigating allegations of racist abuse from their own away fans (there is no suggestion any of the fans picture din the background were involved in the abuse)

Tough-tackling: The game was a tight affair and was just shaded by Wolves, who won thanks to a David Edwards strike (there is no suggestion any of the fans picture din the background were involved in the abuse)

A statement on the club's official website, www.canaries.co.uk: 'Norwich City can confirm the club has received a number of complaints from its supporters about an incident in the away end at Molineux during Sunday's Sky Bet Championship match against Wolverhampton Wanderers.

'Following allegations of racist behaviour by two or three supporters, the club is passing our evidence on to police and asking them to investigate the matter further.

'In addition to and separate from the outcome of any police enquiries, the club will ban any supporters we are satisfied are guilty of racist behaviour from Carrow Road for life.

'The vast majority of our supporters are a credit to this football club and the county of Norfolk and we would like to thank the many Norwich fans present at the game who brought this matter to our attention and to the attention of the safety staff at Molineux so promptly.'
