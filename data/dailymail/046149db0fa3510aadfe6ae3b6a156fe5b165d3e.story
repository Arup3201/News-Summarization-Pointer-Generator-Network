A violent mob stamped on a teenager's head and launched pumpkins at him as he lay defenseless on the ground during a vicious gang attack, new video has revealed. 

The shocking footage showed the teenage store clerk was brutally set upon in the parking lot outside a Kroger store in Memphis, Tennessee on Saturday. 

At one point, the attackers, who appear to be African-American, can be seen hurling pumpkins weighing up to 20lb at the white victim as he was being kicked and punched while lying on the ground trying to protect his head.

According to Wreg.com, a 25-year-old said he was attacked by the group as he walked to his car. 

When two Kroger employees aged 17 and 18 ran to help they were repeatedly punched, kicked and stamped on.

Footage shows chaotic scenes unfolding on Saturday night at around 9.15pm as the mob stormed across the parking lot at Highland and Poplar.

Moments later, the video shows a worker being stamped on and kicked a number of times by multiple attackers. 

The onslaught only ended when a security guard stepped in to stop the assault. It is understood the incident was gang related. 

Police later revealed that both of the teenage victims had been beaten unconscious.

The website quotes Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong as calling the incident ‘troubling’ adding: ‘We are fully aware of last night’s incidents.

‘Last night’s events clearly demonstrates a lack of parental controls and if warranted these parents will also be held accountable.’

An investigation is underway.
