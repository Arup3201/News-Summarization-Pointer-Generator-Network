Payout: Alan Whittle, 57, who earned £150,000 a year, received £72,000 compensation after resigning from his job

The former chief executive of a scandal-hit hospital who defied repeated calls to quit received a £72,000 pay-off as 'compensation' when he finally resigned.

Alan Whittle, 57, who has a £1.7million pension pot, also received £30,000 in cash tax-free in the months before he quit - on top of his £150,000-a-year salary.

He ran Basildon Hospital which was slammed by regulators in 2009 for bad nursing standards, dirty wards and a lack of leadership which led to an estimated 400 avoidable deaths a year.

Mr Whittle was engulfed in scandal himself when he walked out on his wife of 28 years Tracy and moved into hospital accommodation with his mistress.

He presented the mother of his four sons with an 'exotic' bouquet of flowers on their wedding anniversary in September 2007 before walking out on her minutes later so that he could be with Karen Bates, who was a patient safety manager at his hospital.

Mr Whittle, who is a former local government accountant, finally quit his post last September and received his £72,000 payoff as 'compensation for loss of office'.

Last night hospital bosses claimed they did not know why he received the severance pay and said it was approved by former hospital chairman Sir Peter Dickson.

Payouts are usually made to people made redundant or who are asked to resign.

However, the hospital maintained Mr Whittle, who was a local authority accountant before working his way up at the hospital, stood down voluntarily.

A spokeswoman said: 'This was a decision of the previous chairman so you would need to ask him why it was approved. We have a new board that was not party to this decision, but we understand Mr Whittle resigned.'

Details of the payout were included in the hospital's annual report.

Mr Whittle, who earned more than Prime
Minister David Cameron, announced he was leaving in January 2012, but 
did not go until current boss Clare Panniker took over in September.

Her arrival signalled several changes on the board of directors.

Dozens of patients died needlessly at Basildon Hospital because of appalling standards, a damning report said.

Unannounced visits by inspectors from the Care Quality Commission found blood spattered on curtains and chairs in the A&E ward, a catheter bag on the floor, poorly-trained nurses and patients treated on trolleys.

A commode was soiled under the seat, nurses were failing to feed frail elderly people and patients had pressure sores.

The report slammed bad management at the 'elite' hospital which was designated as a foundation trust.

Local MP Jackie Doyle-Price, who has spoken out about the 'utterly complacent' attitude of management at the hospital, said it was a golden handshake for failure.

'Unfortunately we see this all too often in the NHS, when people fail they get a golden handshake,' she said.

'We need to shine a light on some of those payouts. In my view Mr Whittle should have fallen on his sword a lot earlier.

'The board should have held him to account. By 2005 it was clear Basildon Hospital was failing and in 2009 it was criticised by regulators.

'We pay board of directors to act on our behalf and challenge management. They were turning up and taking the money but not asking questions.

'I am pleased that now we have got rid of all that and there is a chance for this hospital to rise again.'

Mr Whittle did not respond to requests for a comment at his home in Chafford Hundred, Essex.
