Britain is the most vulnerable country in Europe to terrorist attacks, a new report has warned.

The UK suffered 131 terror incidents last year, with three people killed including Lee Rigby, the soldier butchered in cold blood by cleaver-wielding Muslim fanatics outside his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London.

The Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) ranked Britain 27 out of 162 countries on its annual Global Terrorism Index.

The UK is pushed up the list because of a number of terror attacks from dissident Republican organisations, including IRA splinter groups, in Northern Ireland.

Some countries associated with disorder and random violence, such as Indonesia, where the 2002 Bali bombings took place, and Sri Lanka, which has fought a violent insurgency against Tamil Tigers militants, are lower down the list.

The think-tank also said there were up to 370 British jihadists fighting with Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria – the second highest total after France which has up to 410 extremists in the warzone.

Globally, the number of terror attacks hit a record high with 9,184 strikes last year – up 44 per cent. These incidents cost 17,958 lives – up 61 per cent from just over 11,100 in 2012.

Terrorism is dominated by four organisations – Islamic State, Boko Haram in Nigeria, Al Qaeda and the Taliban, who are collectively responsible for 66 per cent of all deaths.

Over 80 per cent of the deaths from terrorist atrocities were recorded in just five countries: Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. Russia was 11th on the list and Turkey – which borders Syria – 17th. France is 56th and Germany 83rd.

More than 6,300 terror victims – one-third of all those killed – were in Iraq, which has been blighted by a wave of bloody sectarian attacks and the rise of Islamic State, responsible for beheadings, crucifixions and massacres.

Steve Killelea, executive chairman of the IEP, said there had been a ‘significant and worrying increase’ in instances of terrorism.

But he said a person was 40 times more likely to be murdered than killed in a terror attack, and in the UK an individual was 188 times more likely to be murdered than die in an extremist atrocity.
