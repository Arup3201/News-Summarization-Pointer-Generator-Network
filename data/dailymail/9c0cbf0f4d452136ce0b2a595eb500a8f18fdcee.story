Russia's secret service has claimed that Al-Qaeda are behind spate of forest fires across Europe.

The revelations come after deadly fires which have swept through forest 
land in the EU over the past few months.

Only last week a forest fire fanned by gusting winds forced the evacuation of some 2,000 people from a handful of small mountain towns in eastern Spain.

In both Portugal and Spain thousands of residents have been forced to flee their homes as well as dozens of people killed.

The Telegraph reported that the warning was at a meeting of heads of security agencies, by Director of the Federal Security Service Alexander
 Bortnikov.

He stated: 'One should note that setting fires to forests in the 
countries of the European Union is a new tendency in al-Qaeda's strategy
 of a 'thousand cuts.'

He
 explained that igniting fires allowed the terror group to inflict 
'significant economic and moral damage without serious preliminary 
preparations, technical equipment or significant expenses.'

Detailed in the memorably titled, 'It is of your Freedom to Ignite a Firebomb', the magazine encourages any would-be terrorist to target Montana, because of the rapid population growth in its wooded areas.

In his statement Mr Bortnikov also said it was very difficult for special services to find and prosecute such arsonists.

Last month wildfires forced thousands of people to flee their homes on the Spanish Canary Islands of La Gomera and Tenerife.

Firefighters battled searing temperatures and stiff winds as the flames threatened a World Heritage site whose wooded land is 11 million years old.

On La Gomera, the fires destroyed 7,400 acres forcing the evacuation of more than 4,000 people from 13 villages in the island's west and southwest.

On Tenerife 2,200 were moved from their homes.

In July dozens of people have been forced to evacuate their homes as wildfires sweep across the Portuguese islands of Madeira.

Destruction:

Risks: A map showing the current risks of a forest fire in Europe

Cash-strapped 
Portugal, which received a bailout worth 78bn euros ($116bn or Â£70bn), 
from other European countries and the International Monetary Fund, has 
had relatively few forest fires in the past two years, as temperatures 
were low and rainfall high.

But
 the country has also suffered a drought since the beginning of the year
 and this, coupled with a scorching heatwave, increased the risk of 
fires.

Although al-Qaeda were weakened by the death of leader in May last year,  the organisation still remain a 
significant threat to countries they consider an enemy because they are have looked at smaller scale operations such as fires.
