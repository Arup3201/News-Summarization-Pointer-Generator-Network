Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Co took to the pitch at St Jakob-Park in Basle for a training session on Sunday ahead of England's first competitive game since their dire World Cup.

Roy Hodgson's men face Switzerland on the same pitch on Monday night, in what has been billed as the toughest of their Euro 2016 qualifiers in Group E.

Rooney, speaking to press, insists he knows what's at stake and the England captain reckons a convincing win would do wonders for the confidence of the Three Lions after a dismal time in Brazil.
