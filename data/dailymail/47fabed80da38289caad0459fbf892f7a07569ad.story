Armed with a 3ft machete, the masked raider who burst into a convenience store at 6am wasn’t expecting much resistance.

But he hadn’t bargained on Muhammed Maqsood.

As these dramatic CCTV images show, the fearless shopkeeper armed himself with a metal shutter pole and embarked on a duel with the thug.

Despite being hit three times with the machete and losing part of a finger, Mr Maqsood, known as Max, battled valiantly on and eventually sent the raider packing empty-handed.

Police released footage of the clash which took place at Max and Sons store in Eden Vale, Sunderland, at 6am last Saturday. 

Mr Maqsood, 63, who has run his shop for 32 years, said: ‘He was telling me “give me the money, give me the money” and he showed me the big knife, which was 3ft long.

“I went to the counter and said to him “cool down” and he followed me. He got me three times, but I used the pole twice and got him once on the shoulder and he ran off empty-handed.

‘It was a shock and I’ve never done anything wrong to anybody.’

Acting Detective Sergeant Nick Lawrence said: ‘The footage is clearly distressing as it shows the man going in armed with the machete and struggling with the shopkeeper.

‘This sort of incident is extremely unusual in the area and I’d like to reassure people we’re doing everything we can to trace the man in the CCTV.

'This is why we’ve released the images – we want people to let us know who this is. Someone out there will know.’
