Newly declassified documents show the FBI kept close tabs on Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's only daughter after her high-profile defection to the United States in 1967.

The documents show the agency was gathering details from informants on how Lana Peters' arrival was affecting international relations at that time. She was known as Svetlana Alliluyeva before her defection.

Ms Peters died last year, aged 85, in a Wisconsin nursing home.

Journey: Peters, pictured in 2010, moved to the U.S. in 1967. She moved back to the Soviet Union in 1984 - but returned to the U.S. a year later

The FBI's file mainly contains memos 
and 
news articles from the late 1960s. One 1967 memo details a conversation 
with a confidential source who said Peters' defection would have a 
'profound effect' on anyone else considering such a move from the Soviet
 bloc.

The files were released today under a Freedom of Information Act request. 

Svetlana Peters, who famously denounced communism and
moved to the United States in the late 1960s, died from colon cancer.

Her defection in 1967 - partly motivated by the poor treatment of her late husband, Brijesh Singh,
by Soviet authorities - caused an international furore.

Within months, she published her a memoir about life in Russia, entitled Twenty Letters to a Friend, that became a best-seller.

But Peters, who was known internationally by her previous name, Svetlana Alliluyeva, said her
identity involved more than just switching from one side to the other in the
Cold War.

Upon her arrival in New York City in
1967, the 41-year-old said: 'I have come here to seek the self-expression
that has been denied me for so long in Russia.'

She said she had come to
doubt the communism she was taught growing up and believed there weren't
capitalists or communists, just good and bad human beings.

In the book, she recalled her father, who died in 1953 after ruling the
nation for 29 years, as a distant and paranoid man.

Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin denounced her as a 'morally unstable' and 'sick person'.

'I switched camps from the Marxists
to the capitalists,' she recalled in a 2007 interview. But she said her identity was far 
more
complex than that and never completely understood.

'Over me my father's
shadow hovers, no matter what I do or say.'

'People say, "Stalin's daughter,
Stalin's daughter," meaning I'm supposed to walk around with a rifle and shoot
the Americans.

'Or they say, "No, she came here. She is an American citizen."
That means I'm with a bomb against the others.

'No, I'm neither one. I'm
somewhere in between. That "somewhere in between" they can't understand.'

The defection came at a high personal cost. She left two children behind in
Russia - Josef and Yekaterina - from previous marriages.

Both were upset by her
departure, and she was never close to either again. Peters was Stalin's only daughter. She had two brothers, Vasili and Jacob.

When
 Lana was six years old, her mother, Stalin’s second wife, Nadezhda, 
shot herself after a row over his philandering. Thereafter, Lana was 
raised by a beloved nanny.

At 17, she fell in love for the first time, with a film-maker and writer 22 years her senior named Aleksei Kapler.

But Stalin did not approve of Kapler, 
whom he dismissed as a ‘Bohemian artist’ and a Jew, and banished him to 
Siberia for ten years.

 Yakov Dzhugashvili,
 born in 1907, was Stalin's eldest child and raised by his aunt in 
Tbilisi, Georgia. During WWII, Yakov fought in Russia's Red Army and was
 captured by the Nazis in 1941. He died in a concentration camp in 1943,
 aged 35. It has been suggested that he ran into an electric fence to 
kill himself.

Konstantin Kuzakov,
 born in 1911, was Stalin's illegitimate second child, whose mother was 
Stalin's landlady while he was in exile. In 1932, the Soviet secret 
police forced him to sign a statement promising he would not reveal 
Stalin was his father. He was later a colonel in WWII. After he was accused of being a spy, he was dismissed from the Communist party. He died in 1996.

Vasili Dzhugashvili, born in 1921, was
 the son of Stalin and his second wife. After her death, Stalin rarely 
visited Vasili and Lana, and they were raised by nannies. Vasili
 served in the Red Air Force, but was dismissed after allowing planes to
 fly in bad weather. He was imprisoned for giving away secret 
information to foreign diplomats. He died in 1962, aged 40, from 
alcoholism.

Incensed that her boyfriend had influenced her to apply for a university fine arts course, he also insisted she study history and become ‘an educated Marxist’.

In an interview with the Daily Mail last year, she said of her father: ‘He broke my life. I want to explain to you, he broke my life twice.

‘He put to jail and then to labour camp the man I loved. I saw for the first time that my father could do that.’

She added: ‘He was a very simple man. Very rude. Very cruel. There was nothing in him that was complicated. He loved me and he wanted me to be with him.’

Peters graduated from Moscow University
in 1949, worked as a teacher and translator and travelled in Moscow's literary
circles before leaving the Soviet Union.

She was married four times - the last
time to William Wesley Peters, an apprentice to the great architect Frank Lloyd Wright. She took the name Lana Peters.

The couple had a
daughter, Olga, before divorcing in 1973.

Peters wrote three more books, including Only One Year, an
autobiography published in 1969. The book made more than $3 million.

Her father's legacy appeared to haunt her throughout her life.

She denounced
his policies, which included sending millions into labor camps.

'Over me my father's
shadow hovers, no matter what I do or say,' she lamented in a 1983
interview with the Chicago Tribune.

After living in Britain for two years, Peters returned to the Soviet Union
with Olga in 1984, saying she wanted to be reunited with her
children.

Her Soviet citizenship was restored, and she denounced her time in
the U.S. and Britain, saying she never really had freedom.

But more than a year
later, she asked for and was given permission to leave after feuding with
relatives. She returned to the U.S. and vowed never to go back to Russia.

By her later life, she was fully 
immersed in American culture, admitted that she enjoyed American food, 
particularly hamburgers, and American films, and prefered to speak her 
adopted language.

In an 
interview with the Daily Mail last year, she said: ‘I have had American 
citizenship for 30 years - and my daughter was born here - but they (the
 Russian authorities) still won’t recognise that. They still want to 
think of me as Russian.

‘And I hate them! I hate the Russian language! We aren’t Russian, you see. We are Georgian.’

When asked if she had forgiven 
Stalin, she snapped: ‘I don’t forgive anything or anybody! If he could 
kill so many people, including my uncles and auntie, I will never 
forgive him. Never!’

She later lived in Cornwall, England for a brief period in the mid 1990s.

A documentary, Svetlana About Svetlana, aired at the Madison Film Festival, Wisconsin in 2010. But Peters, who did not attend the airing, later expressed regret at taking part, claiming the film-maker Lana Parshina had tricked her.

'This girl (Parshina) told me she was a college film student and she had to present something different,’ said Lana.

‘She was young, and I always like to help young people, so I let her in. But she only came to see me twice and she didn’t say she was making a film about my father.

‘She just said it was going to be about the way I live now. I wish I didn’t do it. I won’t even make any money out of it. She will make all the money.’

She went into seclusion in the last 
decades of her life in Richland Centre, Wisconsin, and relied on a cane 
after she developing scoliosis — a condition which twists the spine.

Her survivors
include her daughter Olga, who now goes by Chrese Evans and lives in Portland,
Oregon, where she manages a clothes shop.

Her second daughter, who was born in 1950, goes by Katya, and is a scientist who
studies an active volcano in eastern Siberia.

A son, Josef, died in 2008 at age 63 in Moscow, according to media reports
in Russia.
