A man who spent Sunday night in police custody in connect with the death of a man who had broken into his car in parking lot at the Kansas City Chief's Arrowhead Stadium is expected to be released later today.

The unidentified man, who'd taken his son to Sunday’s game against the Denver Broncos, returned to his Jeep at about 5pm yesterday to find a man sitting in his vehicle and rifling through his belongings.

As the two men brawled, the boy ran for help. The altercation ended when the intruder collapsed to the pavement.

A man who spent Sunday night in police custody in connect with the death of a man in the parking lot at the Kansas City Chief's Arrowhead Stadium is expected to be released later today

The man, aged in his 20s, was found lying unconscious on the pavement. Paramedics began administering first aid before he was transported to a hospital, where he died.

The father was one of three people taken into custody by police on Sunday, who also interviewed other witnesses.

On Monday police said that they expect to 
release the three whom they described as ‘persons of interest’ in
 their investigation into the man’s suspicious death. 

Officers are also searching a 
suburban Kansas City home, believed to belong to one of the persons of interest, in connection with the death.

Police spokesman Darin Snapp said that detectives had received information that evidence related to the
 man's death is at the home in Independence.

Medical authorities told investigators on Sunday evening they could detect 'no obvious signs of what caused (the man’s) death.'

An autopsy will determine how the man died. Police haven't released his name but say he's in his mid-20s.

'Talking to several witnesses that 
were out here in the parking lots, there was an individual who came back
 to his vehicle, saw someone inside the vehicle that did not belong,' said Snap.

'A struggle ensued between the two. That's when the individual (who had been inside the vehicle) collapsed.'

Investigating: Kansas City police Officer Darrin Snapp said an autopsy will be key since the man wasn't stabbed or shot

Snapp said there were no obvious indications of how the death occurred. He had not been shot or shot, and hospital officials didn't find signs of a significant struggle on his body.

'We
 don't know if the person had a health condition, had a heart attack. We
 don't know,' Snapp said.

'We're going to investigate this as a homicide
 until we hear differently. Right now it's a suspicious death but we are
 going to investigate it as a homicide.'

Officers said the fight did not appear to be related to fan rivalry.

Chiefs
 spokesman Ted Crews said the team is aware of the incident but cannot 
comment further because of the police investigation.

Flashing
 lights from ambulances and police cars were visible across the 
Arrowhead Stadium parking lot as cars tried to leave after the game.

The game began about 3.30pm and the Chiefs lost to the Denver Broncos.

The
 death came one year to the day after Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher 
shot and killed his girlfriend, Kasandra Perkins, at a 
home not far from the stadium

Belcher then drove to the team's practice
 facility and fatally shot himself in front of then-coach Romeo Crennel 
and general manager Scott Pioli.
