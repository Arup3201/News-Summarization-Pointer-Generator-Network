Against the odds, Southampton are flying high in the Premier League and shocked Arsenal in the Capital One Cup.

Ronald Koeman's side were written off after a less-than-ideal summer, so what has got the Saints marching on this season?

Sportsmail looks at five reasons. 

Southampton have won five in a row, including a 2-1 win against Arsenal in the Capital One Cup

Humility

Not a trait obviously associated with superstar Dutch footballers and Koeman isn't meek. However, he has learned his trade along the way. 

He had looked like another star name jobbing his way around Europe on the basis of his playing reputation. His stints at Ajax, Valencia, Benfica and AZ Alkmaar endly badly. But at Feyenoord he took a struggling club with limited resources and restored them to their place in Holland's top three. 

Even during his troubled spells there were indications of talent: an impressive Copa del Rey win with Valencia and a Champions League quarter final with Benfica. Along the way, unlike many footballing celebrities, he seemed to have continued learning and improved.

Ronald Koeman was a fine player, but he's learnt the ropes as a manager and is now experienced

Tactical Continuity

At first glance there doesn't seem that much in common between Koeman and Maurico Pochettino. The clue is in Marcelo Bielsa, however. 

Koeman of course was schooled in the Johan Cruyff school at Ajax and Barcelona at the same time as Pochettino was coming under the influence of Bielsa in Argentina. And Bielsa and Cruyff are the two most important mentors to Pep Guardiola. 

On separate continents in Holland and Argentina, a common style was emerging of rampaging full backs, splitting centre halves and intense pressing. Koeman and Pochettino come from same broad tradition, even if their mentors developed far apart.

Good signings

With close on £100million incoming over the summer, it must have been tempting for club and newly-installed manager to go a little crazy. Instead they have made what look like steady and sensible signings, using their new-found financial muscle responsibly. 

Koeman knows all about Graziano Pelle, having managed him at Feyenoord; in Dusan Tadic, he simply went for the best young emerging star in Eredivisie, who was destined for one of the Dutch big three, and took him straight to Premier League; Fraser Forster was an obvious and solid addition; Ryan Bertrand likewise; Florin Gardos and Toby Alderweireld have added depth to the squad and seemingly quality as well.

Graziano Pelle scored plenty of goals for Feyenoord under Koeman and is continuing that in the Premier League

The world-renowned academy

They haven't quite come up with Leo Messi, Andres Iniesta and Xavi on the south coast. But Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Gareth Bale, Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers isn't a bad list of alumini. The club is repaing the benefits of ten years of the right kind of work. 

Not only financially are the club secure (see above) but Koeman still has the likes of James Ward-Prowse at his disposal, as well as fellow Englishmen Jack Cork and Nathaniel Clyne.

Adam Lallana and Co may have left, but the Saints still have players coming through their ranks

And a little dose of good luck....

Liverpool aside and nowithstanding that superb win at Arsenal last night in the Capital One Cup, 

Koeman has had a gentle introduction to the Premier League. The run of winnable fixtures continues, though there is a delicious clash with Pochettino's Tottenham forthcoming. 

The comeuppance is from November 30th to December 28th, with a run of games against Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United, Everton and Chelsea. 

Still, nothing like momentum to get help settle you in. And given the respective form of some of those teams and The Saints, who's to say they should fear them? 

Southampton have had a relatively easy start... so, will it last?
