Ministers were last night accused of breaking promises to reduce plastic bag usage and its devastating impact on the environment by appearing to dismiss calls to charge a small fee.

Despite growing momentum to introduce a charge for the bags, Richard Benyon said it ‘may not be the best option’ due to ‘pressures on household budgets’.

Measures to slash the billions of carrier bags handed out by retailers every year were backed by David Cameron, Nick Clegg and then prime minister Gordon Brown when the Mail launched its ‘Banish the Bags’ campaign in 2008.

Death at sea: Ministers were accused of failing to reduce plastic bag usage and its impact on the environment, such as this turtle entangled in a bag, by appearing to dismiss calls to charge a small fee

Usage initially dropped by 14 per cent, but the issue was then kicked into the long grass by the Coalition and in 2011 350million more bags were handed out.

Mr Cameron responded by issuing an ultimatum to supermarkets ordering them to deliver significant falls in numbers or be forced to by law.

'Banish the bags': Despite momentum to introduce a charge for plastic bags, Richard Benyon said it 'may not be the best option' due to 'pressures on household budgets'

A poll last year found a majority of the public would back a charge.

However Mr Benyon – the minister in 
charge of the natural environment – laid out objections on cost grounds,
despite research showing a fee would make people re-use bags and 
therefore escape the charge.

The Coalition has also raised a plethora of unavoidable green taxes which put a far heavier burden on family finances.

Just
three months ago farming minister David Heath said a charge – which has
been successfully introduced in Wales at 5p, is coming to Northern 
Ireland in April and is being consulted on in Scotland – would change 
behaviour in ‘that very large middle group who want to do the right 
thing and feel guilty when they do not’.

Campaigners say plastic 
carriers are used for an average of just 20 minutes but damage the 
environment for hundreds of years, killing birds and wildlife which 
ingest them and blighting beaches.

Dr Sue Kinsey, senior pollution policy adviser at the Marine Conservation Society, said: ‘We are absolutely astounded that Richard Benyon has come to this decision.

'Our research shows that bag charging is popular and effective.’

Tory MP Zac Goldsmith who backs a charge, said: ‘I understand the Treasury's reluctance, but it is important to recognise that no one is asking for a tax.

'This would be a simple levy that shoppers can easily avoid, and which would be distributed to community groups, not the Government. Wherever it has been applied, it is popular and effective.

‘If Columbus had dropped plastic bags over the side of his boat 500 years ago, there’s a pretty good chance they would still be floating around intact today.  We are an extraordinarily wasteful country and of all the waste we generate, the plastic bag is surely the most idiotic.’

Green MP Caroline Lucas accused the Government of ‘betraying its promise’ to take action and said the Mail’s campaign had ‘demonstrated the level of public support for such a measure’.

Adam Royle of the Campaign to Protect Rural England said taxpayers already foot a huge bill for councils to clear up littered bags.

He said: ‘Carrier bags are not a free resource. Littered carrier bags find their way everywhere – becoming unsightly and horrible eye-sores right across our countryside, and causing horrible harm to wildlife. This is the real price that is being paid.’

A poll by Break the Bag Habit found 75 per cent of people think a bag charge would cut usage and help to protect the environment, and most -56 per cent – backed a small 5p charge.

It is understood the Treasury wanted to block a charge which could raise millions of pounds a year for good causes.

The Environment Department, Defra, insist they have not made a decision yet and are still monitoring the situation in other parts of the UK while ‘considering all the relevant factors, including the pressure on household budgets at this time’.

A Number 10 source denied the idea had been axed and said it was ‘still on the table, and we are looking closely at the situation in other parts of the UK’.

Taxpayers will foot most of a £95,000 bill for a garden featuring an ‘avenue of dead trees’ to educate the public about plant diseases.

Defra will use the cash for the feature at the Chelsea Flower Show in May – despite cuts to flood defences and animal disease controls.

Critics called it a ‘cock-eyed’ plan considering 60 experts in forest research have been sacked as part of government cost-cutting.
