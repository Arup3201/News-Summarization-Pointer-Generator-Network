A woman from south-east China has caused a heated online debate after posting a picture of her breakfast of braised mice, served up by her mother.

A resident of Fuzhou in Fujian Province, the woman, who is simply known as Miss Chen, said her mother insisted on her finishing a bowl of mice that morning before she rushed to work.

She said her mother believed she was looking jaded and the dish would help as it was 'highly nutritious', reported the People's Daily Online. 

Yuk: Miss Chen is forced to eat this bowl of braised mice as breakfast by her mother, who believes one mouse contains the nutrition of three chickens

Miss Chen said at first she thought they were braised rabbits. After realising they were mice, she refused to eat, but her mum pressured her to eat them all.

'My mum said it was a great effort to pluck out all the hair from these mice,' said Miss Chen. 'She said it's hard work.'

She ate all mice reluctantly with her eyes shut, and she said she felt sick all morning.

Delicacy: Mice, especially dried mice jerky, are one of the eight treasured foods in western Fujian province. Locals believe eating rodents can treat hair loss

Mice are one of the eight treasured delicacies in western Fujian, with dried mice jerky being especially popular. Miss Chen said her family believes one mouse is as notorious as three chickens.

Residents in Fuzhou also think that eating mice can help treat hair loss.

Local experts however warn against the consumption of rodents.

Lecturer Chen from the School of Life and Science at Fujian University said the small mammal can be the carrier of more than a dozen of germs and this might harm diners' health.
