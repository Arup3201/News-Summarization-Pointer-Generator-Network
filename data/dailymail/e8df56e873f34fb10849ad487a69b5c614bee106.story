A teenage hit man sentenced to three 
years in prison for beheading four boys in Mexico may be sent to the 
United States when his sentence ends next month.

It's not known where Edgar Jimenez Lugo’s will head to given that it is likely he would face violent reprisals at his former home in a working-class village south of Mexico City.

The governor of Morelos, the state where
 Edgar is being held, wants him sent to the United States when his 
sentence is completed on December 3rd.

Aged 14 when he committed his crimes, his time behind bars was just three years - the maximum penalty allowed under Mexican law.

The request by the governor for him to be sent to the U.S. is not an unreasonable one. Lugo was born in the United States and is therefore an American citizen.

'We have 13 days to see if he can be 
deported to the United States so that he can be placed in an institution
 there,' Gov. Graco Ramirez told a radio station in Mexico on Thursday. 'He is an American citizen.'

Edgar was 14 in August 2010 when he 
killed the young men — a student, a cook at a university, a gas station 
attendant and a small-business owner.

Lugo, nicknamed 'El Ponchis,' received a
 three-year term, which was the maximum allowed under law, after he 
admitted to beheading the four boys in central Mexico. The beheaded 
bodies were hung from a bridge in the tourist town of Cuernavaca.

When he was arrested, he calmly 
admitted to the killings but said he was kidnapped at age 11 and had 
been forced to work for the Cartel of The South Pacific.

At
 the time he told reporters, 'I participated in four executions, but I 
did it drugged and under threat that if I didn't, they would kill me.'

Mexican and U.S. officials are now trying to weigh the appropriate response to concerns about what comes next for the 17-year-old whose birth certificate confers the rights of U.S. citizenship.

Lugo became notorious due to his age and
 online videos that discussed him. There was also a Youtube video of him
 beating a man with a two-by-four while the man was hanging from the 
ceiling.

Edgar was convicted in juvenile court in July 2011 of homicide and organized crime charges, and sentenced to three years in custody, the maximum allowed. With time served before his conviction, he’s now due for release.

Once freed, Edgar will face no clear legal obstacles to crossing into the United States.

'He can come live here when he turns 18 
(in May) without any supervision. The U.S. can't do anything, and Mexico
 cannot do anything,' she said. 'He wasn't charged with conspiracy in 
the U.S.' said Guadalupe Valencia, a San Diego criminal defense attorney.

Lugo was arrested at a Mexican airport 
when he and a sister were trying to flee authorities and fly to their 
mother in San Diego, the outlet reported.

Yolanda Lugo Jimenez was 
then arrested a few days later on immigration violations and deported in
 April, the outlet reported noting her whereabouts are now unclear.

Because of his criminal background, his family in Mexico fears his return could also put them at risk.

In recent weeks, his case and pending release has received intense media attention locally. A book bearing Edgar’s image on the cover was released last month. It included his former street address.
