Lance Armstrong has admitted that he would still be lying about doping if a federal investigation had never found him out.

The disgraced cyclist, who used performance-enhancing drugs to cheat his way to a record seven successive Tour de France titles after recovering from cancer, said that his lies would still be spiralling if the truth had not been uncovered two years ago.

He told CNN in a phone interview: 'Once you say "no" you have to keep saying "no". If this stuff hadn’t taken place with the federal investigation, I’d probably still be saying "no" with the same conviction and tone as before. But that gig is up.'

'I'd probably still be saying "no"': Lance Armstrong has admitted that he would still be lying about doping if he had not been found out by a federal investigation in 2012

He went on to say that he would not has confessed even to his children: 'Well, that’s a conversation for my kids. But there was a lot of stuff in that lie, not simply me saying, "no". I couldn’t change the story.'

Armstrong is serving a lifetime ban from sport, and said he is surprised at how he is able to go about his daily life without being taunted or heckled for what he did. 

'I never get crap, not once, and I'm surprised by that,' he said.

'Sure, I sometimes get the vibe that someone wants to say something but it's never happened.'

A cancer survivor and once hero to millions, Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories and banned for life from racing in 2012 by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after it accused him in a report of engineering one of the most sophisticated doping schemes in sporting history.

Toughing it up: He admits to having an 'f-you' attitude, but the disgraced cyclist insists he 'never gets crap' from people following his long-awaited admission of long-term doping

The investigation and later admission to doping destroyed Armstrong's reputation and career.

He admitted that he has to accept that he has lost all credibility from the revelations. 'I don’t blame anyone for thinking, "I don’t trust this guy with all his bulls*** for ten years",' he said.

However, he still feels harshly done by in his punishments when compared with other riders who have also been caught doping.

'I think most people are smart enough to say: "That doesn’t make any sense",' he said. 'What stands out in a lot of people’s minds is that we all know what happened in those other years, but those [results] still stand.' 

Armstrong and his team of lawyers are about to face several civil lawsuits that could drain his huge fortune.

Bleak outlook: There's no hope of him ever riding competitively again and he is facing civil lawsuits to the tune of tens of millions of dollars

In June a federal judge rejected Armstrong's bid to dismiss a whistleblower lawsuit claiming that he and his former cycling team, which the U.S. Postal Service had sponsored, defrauded the government in a scheme to use banned, performance-enhancing drugs.

Armstrong claims the U.S. Postal Service benefited hugely from the exposure it got from its sponsorship and that the lawsuit had been brought too late.

The lawsuit has potential $100 million ramifications for a man who was previously one of the world's wealthiest sports stars. 

'I'm very confident that that`s a winner for us,' said Armstrong. 'I don't think anyone can truly argue the U.S. Postal Service was damaged.

'They made a lot of money in the deal and got what they bargained for.

'I worked my ass off for them and I'm proud of it. Furthermore there wasn't a technical relationship between myself and the U.S. Postal Service.'

Reboot: Armstrong hopes to restart his charity work, undergo a course of therapy and says he is planning on writing a book where he will 'put it all out there'

Armstrong has said he now plans to write another book, which unlike his last effort, 'It's Not About the Bike', will be totally honest. 

'I need to write a book and it needs to be pretty raw. I need to put it out there and let it sit. The sooner the better. It has to be the right book, the right tone and there has to be totally no b-s,' he said.

He added that he sees writing as a kind of therapy that will help see him through the next few years, and that he is 'fully committed to putting it all out there.'

Asked about seeking actual therapy, the 42-year-old said: 'My therapy is riding my bike, playing golf and having a beer. I haven’t gotten around to it. I get it totally, but it’s not something that’s taken place yet.' 

Armstrong relishes a good fight, and claims it is this spirit that made him the cyclist he was.

'I definitely have an 'f-you' attitude,' he said. 'I fight in training, I fight to win races, I fight to motivate the guys in the team.'

The list of those he hurt, and who won't forgive him, is long: three-time Tour winner Greg LeMond, journalist David Walsh, who spent more than a decade trying to expose Armstrong, and former friends Frankie and Betsy Andreu, are just a few.

A number have asked whether his public mea culpa on Oprah was genuine and if he needs to do more. 

'That's a difficult one for me to answer,' he said. 'You can't do justice in a one-hour conversation. It was a situation for a lot of people that it was too much information, but for other people - cycling fans, sports fans, for other parts of the population - it wasn't enough, I didn't go far enough.'
