Fraudster: Businessman Guy Brudenell has been jailed for five years and four months at Teesside Crown Court after conning three business associates out of £1.24m

He lived in a country mansion with its own cricket pitch, travelled by private helicopter and enjoyed holidays in some of the world's most glamorous hotspots.

But flamboyant businessman Guy Brudenell's seemingly limitless wealth was no more than a façade, a court heard today.

When he hit hard times Brudenell conned three acquaintances out of £1.24 million to service mounting debts and pay for a £15,000 Swiss skiing holiday and a trip to St Tropez.

His empire eventually collapsed around him as he declared himself bankrupt with £21million debts in 2009.

Today Brudenell, 43, was jailed for five years and four months after pleading guilty to fraud and perjury at Teesside Crown Court.

Prosecutor Nicholas Dry told how Brudenell's 'financial gymnastics' in 'robbing Peter to pay Paul' led to him swindling business colleagues who believed he was a highly successful tycoon.

Her persuaded them to part with £600,000, £400,000 and £240,000 with the promise of quick profits on deals to buy repossessed houses.

Brudenell told one victim in an email: 'I have yet to get a business deal wrong. I have a 100 per cent record for integrity and honesty. My word is my bond.' As a respected figure in North Yorkshire high society, with interests in two leading hotels and a successful business past, no one doubted him until it was too late.

Although he angered neighbours by landing his helicopter in the garden, Brudenell cultivated his respectable image shamelessly. He was photographed at Royal Ascot and even persuaded the Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu to take part in a charity parachute jump with him.

Behind the scenes he was using 'ever more desperate, and ultimately criminal, measures in his bid to stay afloat,' said Mr Dry.

Brudenell sent fraudulent emails and faked bank statements to convince his victims he would repay them and repeatedly sent cheques that failed to clear.

Mr Dry told the court: 'He was a friend and acquaintance of many wealthy individuals with whom he would hunt, shoot and generally socialise.

'He lived a high life with beautiful homes, cars, expensive holidays and a helicopter, but by 2008 all of that had become something of a facade behind which lay a reality of spiralling debt and unsustainable borrowing.'

Brudenell was forced to put his £1.3m home in Nawton, North Yorkshire, on the market. His 2005 marriage to wife Pennita - who arrived at their wedding in a Cinderella-style glass carriage - ended in divorce.

And soon police were probing his financial affairs. One of his victims went to police who uncovered a 'web of lies, deception and fraud.' Passing sentence, Judge Howard Crowson branded Brudenell 'selfish' and told him: 'Your intention was to continue your luxurious life by reason of this fraud.'

Looking tanned and dressed in a pin-striped suit and open-necked shirt, Brudenell sat with his head bowed throughout the majority of the proceedings.

Alasdair Campbell, defending, said Brudenell planned to repay his investors, but suffered badly with the credit crunch.

Outside court Detective Inspector Ian Wills of North Yorkshire Police, said: 'Brudenell blatantly abused the trust of his friends. He was a persistent liar whose deception was compounded by fraudulently altering official documents and lying during legal proceedings in a feeble attempt to delay repayment of the loans and avoid exposure.'
