Bolton are signing Lorient striker Alain Traore on loan.

The deal was agreed on Tuesday morning as Neil Lennon looks to add some pace into his attack. The 27-year-old Traore, a Burkina Faso international, was also on West Brom's extensive list of potential targets.

He can play as a forward or attacking midfielder and on the left wing. Apart from pace and good technique, Traore is adept at taking free-kicks which will provide extra ammunition for Emile Heskey, Eidur Gudjohnsen and Co.

West Ham have revived their deal for Hamilton left-back Stephen Hendrie.

The 20-year-old is poised to fly down to London and undergo a medical later this week ahead of finalising terms.

The deal looked to be off last week when Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie McDonald criticised West Ham for stalling. However, David Sullivan has smoothed over negotiations and a transfer is back on for one of Scotland's most promising defenders.

Middlesbrough left back George Friend is interesting West Brom and Crystal Palace.

The 27-year-old has been a consistent performer for Aitor Karanka's side this season.

And his displays have caught the eye of both Tony Pulis and Alan Pardew.

Sportsmail's Simon Jones reports: QPR asking for Fraizer Campbell as part of Jordon Mutch deal with Crystal Palace. More to follow.

Sportsmail's Simon Jones reports: 

Wigan manager Malky Mackay was among spectators at Leigh on Monday night as Manchester United U21s beat Liverpool U21s 2-1. Mackay is keen to see what is available on loan with United's Nick Powell and Jesse Lingard among those being considered. 

As reported earlier in the day by Sportsmail's Craig Hope, Newcastle are closing in on the signings of Spain Under-19 internationals Jorge Mere and David Concha.

QPR misfit Adel Taarabt has had hopes raised that he could yet secure a return to AC Milan.

The Italians are looking for replacements after Stephan El Shaarawy broke a metatarsal in his right foot, ruling him out for two months. 

Taarabt had a productive loan spell at the San Siro last season and has been keen to return.

Sportsmail understands Manchester City and James Milner have not yet given up on reaching an agreement that would see the midfielder extend his stay in Manchester.

Negotiations are set to re-open in the near future and much will depend upon assurances over playing time.

Milner's contract runs out in the summer and he has been linked with Liverpool and Arsenal.

Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan reports:

Wigan are surprisingly cutting their losses on Adam Forshaw, who is putting the finishing touches on a move to Championship rivals Middlesbrough. The midfielder only signed for the Latics in August, with the club set to lose out on millions as a result of the player not settling and struggling under Malky Mackay.

Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches is the subject of renewed interest from Roma. 

The deal has been bubbling for several months and the Italians have made contact again with the Romanian's representatives. 

Tottenham dismissed reports on Monday that they were being offered Mattia Destro as part of a deal and the likelihood is Roma will make an offer to loan Chiriches with a permanent deal to follow.

West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison is due in Rome today ahead of a medical with Lazio.

The 21-year-old has agreed to join the club in the summer and is due to sign a pre-contract if all goes to plan. Morrison has been offered a four year contract.

Stay tuned for the first pictures of the maverick midfielder in Italy...

Joel Campbell has joined Villarreal on loan until the end of the season - and has posed for his first pictures at his new club. 

On Sunday, Campbell said: 'This means a lot to me, I am very excited with this new opportunity and I hope to sign the contract tomorrow.

Hull City have failed in an ambitious bid to sign Alexandre Pato on loan.

The 25-year-old Brazil striker has also been offered to Everton in recent days while QPR manager Harry Redknapp said his club could not afford the deal.

Steve Bruce was eager to tie up a short term loan but Pato's wages of around £60,000 a week are a big hurdle to overcome.

Dnipro driector Andriy Stenstenko has revealed that the club's star player Yevhen Konoplyanka is on the verge of a move to Roma.

Speaking to the Ukrainian media, Stenstenko claimed the two clubs have agreed a deal in principle and it only remains for the Serie A side to discuss personal terms with the player.

The news will come as a blow to Tottenham, who have been tracking the 25-year-old since last summer.

With his contract running down and no new deal in sight, Manchester United's Dutch forward Robin van Persie admitted he faces an uncertain future at the club.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the options available to him.

Midfielder Marcelo Brozovic has joined Inter Milan from Croatian champions Dinamo Zagreb on a two-year loan deal with the option of making the move permanent.

Harry Redknapp will only listen to permanent offers for Junior Hoilett and Matt Phillips - who are interesting Derby. 

Steve McClaren worked with both during his spell as a coach at QPR and wanted a loan deal for either. 

Hull and West Brom have also asked about the pair. 

Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke has dismissed reports linking him with a move away from the club, insisting he 'sees life in red and white'.

The news will come as a blow to the likes of Manchester United and Manchester City, who are both admirers of the Spain international. 

The 23-year-old played a key role in the heart of Diego Simeone's side as Atletico broke the Real Madrid-Barcelona duopoly last season to claim a surprise La Liga title.

There have been lots of mouth-watering rumours this month, so here at Sportsmail we have kindly rounded up for you guys the 10 transfers all fans want to see the most this month. 

AC Milan's search for a striker is dominating the front pages of the Italian papers this morning, with Roma's Mattia Destro top of Filippo Inzaghi's wanted list.

The 23-year-old has been linked with Tottenham and Arsenal and looks set to be the subject of a transfer tussle between some of Europe's top clubs. 

Lucas has been linked with a move away from Anfield for some time now and the midfielder says he has considered it. 

He said: ‘I would be lying if I said I never thought about something new but I can’t tell you what is going to happen. I just focus on the day and leave the future to take care of itself.’Interestingly, what Lucas fails to say is that he now wants to stay at Anfield. So, will he be off in the near future? 

Paul Pogba is one of the most in-demand players in the world with United, Chelsea and Real Madrid all looking at the 21-year-old.

Andrea Pirlo, however, believes that Louis van Gaal's side are wasting their time trying to re-sign the midfielder they let leave Old Trafford in 2012.

He said: ‘For whatever reasons they chose not to give him a chance - and that is a mistake they will have to live with now. I can’t see that he (Pogba) will ever return to Manchester United.’

Callum McManaman is set to undergo his medical at West Bromwich Albion today after the club agreed a £4.75million fee with Wigan.

Personal terms have been finalised with the 23-year-old winger, who could be confirmed as Tony Pulis’s first signing in the next 24 hours. 

Pulis is determined to add considerably to his squad this window with a new left-back and striker prime targets. Ideally he would like another winger and central midfielder too.
