A Grade II listed London mansion which boasts ceilings covered in gold leaf is set to become the most expensive home ever sold at auction when it goes under the hammer next week.

The seven-bedroom property on Bolton Street, just a few minutes walks from The Ritz in the heart of Mayfair, is being offered with a guide price of £8.3million.

If it fetches that it would top the £5.9 million paid for a mansion block in Finchley Road, according to auction analysts EIG.

The home was built in the early 18th century and has six bathrooms, three reception rooms and two kitchens along with an internal lift and private terrace.

A seven-bedroom property in central London which boasts gold leaf ceilings  is up for auction  with a guide price of £8.3 million

The home on Bolton Street, Mayfair, was built in the early 18th century and has six bathrooms, three reception rooms and two kitchens

It is currently being let out for a staggering £26,000 per month.

The street was built in 1699 and has been home to English diarist and playwright Fanny Burney in 1818 as well as British Whig statesman George Grenville.

In the time of Queen Anne and George I, the celebrated Earl of Peterborough also lived in the prestigious street.

He confessed to having committed three capital crimes before he was 20-years-old, according to historian Mr John Timbs.

The Honourable Mrs Norton also on Bolton Street  in 1841, before settling in Chesterfield Street, Hatton, in 1708.

She described Bolton Street as being 'the most westerly street in London, between the road to Knightsbridge south and the fields north.'

Charles Edward Stuart, The Young Pretender, is also said to have lodged here secretly when in London in the mid 18th century.

The sale is unusual as buyers don't tend to shop for super-expensive homes at auction because of the potential waste of money involved in researching the property, according one industry expert.

Henry Pryor, a buying agent, said: 'Few people would choose to auction an expensive home since doing so may well restrict the number of potential buyers.

'When the gavel goes down it signifies a binding exchange of contracts which means that anyone bidding must have done all their preparatory work before the day.

'If they then lose out then the cost of all that work, of lawyers, surveyors, mortgage brokers etc., is all wasted.'

The mansion will be sold alongside more than 15 homes at Countrywide Auctions' on October 22 at Le Meridien Hotel in Piccadilly

The mansion, which is marketed by Hamptons International, is up for sale at Countrywide Auctions on October 22 at Le Meridien Hotel in Piccadilly, London.

It will be sold alongside more than 15 homes which have a guide price of less than £70,000, including a one-bed flat in Stockton on Tees which could fetch just £25,000.

If all of the remaining 61 properties fetch their guide price, they will sell for around £9.7 million - just £1.4 million more than the single Mayfair home.

At £8.3 million, the buyer of the Mayfair home would also have £581,000 in stamp duty, which is more than the guide prices of any of the other homes at the auction.

Despite this, the agent behind the sale has described the seven-figure home as being offered at a 'reasonable price' and a potentially good investment.

Dominic Hallett, assistant manager of Hamptons International, Mayfair, said: 'It presents a wonderful opportunity to a successful buyer to purchase prime Mayfair real estate at a reasonable price.

'What's more, this pocket of Mayfair, primarily Bolton Street and Clarges Street, is currently undergoing huge residential development which will only serve to close the gap and in some cases supersede values in other more established parts of Mayfair.'

Mark Tanton, head of London auctions at Countrywide added: 'It is uncommon to see a prime Mayfair single residential building a stone's throw from the Ritz come to auction.

'But it is a fantastic way for the vendor to sell quickly and get a strong price.'
