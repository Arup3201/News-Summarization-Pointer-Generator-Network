Spirits will be low among members of the Scottish National Party after the majority of their country voted no in the Independence referendum last week. 

But Angela Constance attempted to brighten up her colleagues' afternoon with a pair of bizarre shoes for her working day.

The Cabinet Secretary for Training, Youth and Women's Employment wore a pair of £125 'Bambi Deer' high heels from British shoe company Irregular Choice as she entered Holyrood parliament. 

Member of Scottish Parliament Angela Constance wore a pair of 'Cherry Deer' heels from Irregular Choice to work today  

 Angela, who is the MSP for Almond Valley, isn't alone in her love for the quirky footwear. 

The heels have taken on a cult following since they were first launched into the market in 2010. 

An Irregular Choice spokesperson said: 'The 'Cherry Deer' heels are one of our best sellers, they sell out every month. 

'We've done the same style with unicorns, dogs and toy heads in the heels instead but these are very popular. 

The quirky design is one of British shoe company Irregular Choice's most popular items. They retail at £125 

'Our audience is so varied, we have customers from between the ages of 15 to 60 years old. 

'Often a mum will take her daughter into a shop and leave with a pair from the collection too. 

'Because the designer himself Dan Sullivan designs 300 pairs a season, so that's 600 pairs a year, there is such a range for people to choose from.

'It has been a family-run business from the start, even his mother and father have been involved from the very beginning.

Angela Constance appeared pleased with her fashion choice as she entered Holyrood parliament 

'So while it's success has turned Irregular Choice into more of a lifestyle brand these days, with everything from shoes to handbags and jewelry, they have kept the aim the same. 

'The ethos was always to inspire people to be different - to choose something a little different from what they usually would.   

'These new pictures of Angela prove that is still very much the case.'
