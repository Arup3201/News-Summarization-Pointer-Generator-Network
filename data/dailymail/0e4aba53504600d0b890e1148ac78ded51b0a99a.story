Police investigating the January murder of a beloved 61-year-old Catholic school teacher in Chicago have discovered a pile of escort ads in his suburban home, it was revealed Thursday.

Alan Filan, a long-time business instructor at Brother Rice High School, was discovered stabbed 14 times in his Orland Park home January 21.

Alisha Walker, a 21-year-old prostitute from Ohio, was arrested days later in Indiana and charged in Filan's stabbing death.

Solicitation: Police found 20 escort ads on Filan's desk from the website Backpage.com

The murder suspect has spent the past three months in jail, and she is due back in court May 28.

Chicago Sun-Times reported Wednesday that investigators working the crime scene in the 9400 block of Georgetown Square back in January came upon 20 Bakcpage.com ads advertising female escorts of Mr Filan's desk.

The 61-year-old teacher, who had spent 39 years working at Brother Rice High School, was stabbed to death January 18.

His body was found in his home at around 10.30am January 21 after a staffer at an Orland Park hotel, where Filan apparently had been moonlighting, called police asking to perform a welfare check.

Filan's autopsy report indicated that the man was found lying face up on the floor under a bay window in his kitchen. He suffered 14 knife wounds in the back of his neck, chest, arm and abdomen, as well as additional cuts and bruises.

Bloody prints left by a pair of high-heeled shoes led responding officers from the body to the door, police said.

Detectives investigating the slaying were able to track Alisha Walker to a motel in Fort Wayne, Indiana, after reading text messages on Filan's phone that were sent from a number listed on a Backpage escort ad they had found in the teacher's home.

When extradited to Illinois and questioned by police, the 21-year-old suspect said that she was acting in self-defense because Filan grabbed a knife in a dispute over her payment.  

The woman, whose extensive criminal record includes multiple charges for prostitution, drug possession and battery, told investigators that she had met with Filan in his house at least twice before the deadly January 18 encounter.

Records obtained by the Sun-Times show that in December 2012, Walker was arrested for allegedly striking another woman over the head with a vodka bottle in an argument over money.

She was also convicted on two prostitution charges in Cook County that year. 

Alan Filan taught at Brother Rice for four decades and was chairman of the school's business studies department. He also coached soccer at another Chicago school.

Beloved curmudgeon: Those who knew Filan remembered him as a cantankerous man who had a warm heart beneath his tough exterior

Not strangers: Walker told police she had two other encounters with Filan in his home before January 18

The 
61-year-old educator came from a politically connected family. His 
brother, William Filan, is a Democratic lobbyist who represents the 
interest of the City of Chicago, while his younger sister, Denise Filan,
 is a Cook County judge.

Following
 his death, Filan's former students and colleagues eulogized the veteran
 educator as a legendary figure in the community known for his bluntness
 and hot temper, but also for his genuine warmth and willingness to help
 his students.

‘He would call people “sugar britches,” but not in a derogatory way,’ Tinley Park Mayor Ed Zabrocki, who worked with Filan at Brother Rice, told Orland Park Patch back in January. ‘It was a term of endearment.’

‘You could say he had a rough exterior, but it was paper thin,’ Zabrocki added. ‘When it came to it, he was always there for the kids.’

Her version: The 21-year-old escort told police she was acting in self-defense because Filan pulled a knife on her

During soccer practices at Victor J. Andrew High School, Filan would sometimes throw his clipboard and yell out things like, 'Here's a quarter... call someone who cares,' and, 'If you were a horse, they'd shoot ya.'

But those who knew Filan well said he brought joy to everyone who was willing to put in the effort and made a real impact in the lives of his students.

Filan taught us things we didn't know he was teaching us until years after we graduated,’ Nicole Hack, who played soccer on Filan’s team, told the paper.
