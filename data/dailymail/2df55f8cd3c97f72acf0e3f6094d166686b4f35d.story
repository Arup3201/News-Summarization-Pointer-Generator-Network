Father-of-three Barry Kadleck, who also served as a magistrate, was discovered at his home the day before he was due to appear at Teesside Crown Court

An ex-government computer specialist who admitted making 4,000 images of child abuse has been found dead hours before he was due in court.  

Father-of-three Barry Kadleck, who also served as a magistrate, was discovered at his home the day before he was due to appear at Teesside Crown Court.

The 61-year-old, who also worked on the London 2012 technology team, was warned to expect prison  when he pleaded guilty to the offences at an earlier hearing last month.

The court would have heard that he was fixated on young girls aged around eight and stockpiled the photographs of children being sexually assaulted.

Court papers say that Kadleck, from Hexham, Northumberland, worked for the Government on secret IT contracts in Dubai and served as a magistrate in Newcastle.

The separated father was arrested at work last year, and told police:'I have been expecting it for some time, and it's no more than I deserve.'

The court heard how investigations discovered thousands of images and videos on his mobile phone, laptop computer and on other storage devices around his house.

Kadleck admitted that he had been looking at the images for the last seven years and told probation officials he was 'fascinated and horrified' by them.

He was supposed to be appearing for sentence on Friday, January 9, but the court heard he was found dead at his home in what was suspected to be a suicide.

A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'Police received a report at approximately 12.30pm on Thursday expressing concern for a man at an address in Hexham.

'Officers attended and paramedics were already working on the 61-year-old man, however he was later confirmed to be dead.

'It is believed that there was no third party involvement and a report is being prepared for the coroner.'

Barry Kadleck,61, had been warned that he faced prison at Teesside Crown Court, pictured above, after admitting the offences at an earlier hearing last month

Kadleck was a senior systems specialist with computer giant IBM for more 20 years and also worked in the technology team involved in the football events at the 2012 Olympics.

He worked as a volunteer driver for a charity based in Hexham,Northumberland, and most recently worked as a senior manager with STME Ltd who describe themselves as the Middle East's leading IT solutions provider and systems integrator.

He was head-hunted by the Government to work on the confidential contract in the Gulf, and returned to the UK five years ago.

Kadleck, whose wife lived on North Tyneside, resigned from his delivery driver job for a supermarket and as a magistrate following his arrest in March last year.

The case, being heard on Teesside because of his links to courts on Tyneside, will be listed again this Friday when it is expected to be discontinued.
