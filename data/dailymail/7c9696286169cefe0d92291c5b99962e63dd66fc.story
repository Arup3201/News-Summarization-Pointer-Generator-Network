Paul Walker's longtime friend and manager was robbed of priceless memories of the 'Fast and Furious' star when thieves burgled his office on the one-year anniversary of the actor's death. 

CCTV captures the moment when brazen robbers broke into Matt Luber's Hollywood management offices and stole years of cherished videos, voice mails and photographs of the late actor along with $300,000 worth of items.

Security footage shows two females thieves breaking into his offices on Sunday at 6am, shortly after the security guards left after working their overnight shift.

The office doors were apparently left unlocked when the employees left for the Thanksgiving holiday, so the robbers did not have to worry about struggling to force their way into the building.

Thief: Paul Walker's manager has been robbed on the anniversary of his death. Two women broke into Matt Luber's office on November 30, 2014, and stole every computer, hard drive and printer in the building.

Calm: The second of the thieves calmly walked to the elevator. The devices they stole held videos, voice mails, and photographs of Paul. Footage from security cameras caught the women going to and from the building

The thieves stole 12 Apple Mac computers as well as a hard drive that contained photos and voicemails of Luber's children and friends, including Walker.

Mr Luber, who had known the actor for 20 years, said CCTV footage shows one of the women waiting at the elevator before going up the stairs. 

'She comes back down with one computer and then they disappear for about an hour, possibly waiting to see if an alarm goes off,' he said.

They then returned with a huge suitcase, changed their outfits upstairs, and then come back down with more devices.

Quite the haul:  Once they were inside, they proceeded to steal 18 Mac computers and multiple printers – adding up to an estimated value of more than $20,000

Easy find: The office doors were actually left unlocked when the employees left for the Thanksgiving holiday, so the robbers did not have to worry about struggling to force their way into the building

Caught on camera: The thieves actions were recorded by security cameras located in the stairwell and the elevator

Who knew? Some have suggested the robbery may have been an inside job

The talent manager believes the suspects cased his office, because they knew the entrance code, and knew exactly what to look for.

He is now pleading with the thieves to return the stolen mementos which were found to be missing at 9.30am on Monday.

'Give me back my hard drive. Give me back my pictures. Put it in the mail anonymously. Drop if off with the security guards,' he said.

The Fast and Furious star lost his life on November 30 last year when the Porsche Carrera GT his business partner  Roger Rodas was driving crashed into a tree in Santa Clarita, California. 

Investigators determined the car was traveling between 80 and 93 miles an hour when it crashed, killing both men.

Luber described Walker's death as the worst thing that has ever happened to him. 

Fans, friends, family and co-stars mourned the 40-year-old actor's death on the anniversary of the collision.

His 16-year-old daughter Meadow posted a previously unseen picture of the actor cradling her as a toddler, writing simply 'I love you'. 

Fast and Furious co-star Michelle Rodriguez joined Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris, who were among the first of the late actor's former co-stars to reflect on their memories of the star.

'I love you Paul. Your living in the hearts of all who love you for sure. Sending mad love out to Heaven @SupportROWW' she wrote on Twitter. 

Devastating: Luber 'was Paul's manager and close friend for decades. Not only did the computers have Paul Walker's his entire life on there but, more importantly, all of the files on Walker's life and death,' said a friend

Friends and fans left flowers and candles at the scene on the one-year anniversary of his death

Tyrese Gibson, one of Paul's co-stars who was also a good friend off-screen, shared a touching tribute to his 'brother' on his Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

The 35-year-old, who made his first appearance in 2003's 2 Fast 2 Furious, said: 'In this life one would hope to be this 'effective' 1 year ago today. God called an angel home early.... I miss my brother I miss my friend and I miss OUR STAR!!!!!'

He added: 'Physically gone but forever alive in our minds, hearts and spirit.... What was once tears of pain and shock are now tears of JOY celebrating all that you stood for...

'Everyone worldwide please take 5 mins out of your day to send live, prayers and energy to Paul's family his daughter Meadow and immediate circle today will be a tough day for us.... To this day his arm is still around my neck with love and protection... Rest in heaven....' 

Since his tragic death, two films, Hours and Brick Mansions, have been released posthumously and his final film, the seventh instalment in the Fast & Furious franchise, is due for release next year.

A reward is being offered for Mr Luber's stolen items and anyone with information is urged to contact Luber at (866) 370-2019, extension 100.
