The Ballon d’Or score moved to Ronaldo 3 Messi 4 on Monday night in Zurich and the good news for football is that with so much playing time potentially still ahead of them the greatest head-to-head in the game’s history might still have years to play out.

‘Don’t bet against it being 5-4 to Ronaldo in a couple of years,’ was the sentiment of one Madrid commentator in this morning’s celebration of their man winning the Ballon d’Or 2014 and it’s easy to see why even non-Madrid supporters might agree that Ronaldo now has everything in his favour to glide past Messi by winning World Player of the year two more times.

But to doubt Messi’s ability to bounce back in this two-man tug-o-war for world supremacy is to massively underestimate someone who is still only 27 – in any normal career he would now be entering his prime.

Barcelona may be in turmoil with elections called 12-months early for the end of the year, a change of coach on the horizon, and a transfer ban to be suffered until 2016 but there were signs of life in their weekend win over Atletico Madrid. 

The enduring image from the game of Messi celebrating the third goal arm in arm with Neymar and Luis Suarez is another clue as to why it might not be all downhill from here for the Argentine. He rose to prominence in that wonderful triangle of mesmerizing movement and short passes made up of Andres Iniesta and Xavi.

The Messi, Suarez, Neymar holy trinity is very different – one compromised of attackers not midfielders but it inspires awe all the same. He can’t complain that he is not in the right company as he attempts to get back on top in Spain.

Ronaldo celebrated winning the Ballon d'Or for the second consecutive year with a loud scream

Portuguese magazine Abola says Ronaldo's rallying cry means he is now looking to match Lionel Messi 

Ronaldo, we know, will drive on and on until his supreme physique can no longer carry him. He will be 30 next month but seems to only be getting stronger. His agent Jorge Mendes told Spanish radio on Monday night that his star client would play on until he was 40. ‘He will still score 20 goals a season with his head when he is 39, mark my words’ he said.

The implication of that statement was that even when he can’t sprint as he does now he will not lose his aerial prowess. Having started his career as a wiry winger and become a wide forward he could easily finish up an out-an-out centre-forward who can no longer create the chances quite so freely, but can still take them.

Messi also looks capable of adjusting to suit the passing of time. He has a few more years in him yet as a forward but he has shown at the start of this season and during the last campaign that he also has it in him to become king of the assists and occupy a slightly deeper position in the team.

Ronaldo scored a staggering 56 goals in 51 appearances for Real as they won four trophies in 2014

The 27-year-old (centre) scored 50 goals in 52 appearances for Barcelona last season

Ballon d'Or: Cristiano Ronaldo 

Women's world player of the year: Nadine Kessler 

Puskas award: James Rodriguez 

World coach of the year for men's football: Joachim Low 

World coach of the year for women's football: Ralf Kellermann 

World XI: Neuer; Lahm, Ramos, David Luiz, Thiago Silva; Di Maria, Iniesta, Kroos; Messi, Ronaldo, Robben 

FIFA presidential award: Hiroshi Kagawa 

FIFA fair play award: FIFA volunteers 

For now both will keep doing what they have been doing for the last five years. Each player has 252 goals in that time and Ronaldo at least left no-one at Zurich in any doubt that his hunger for more is not about to be lost with phrases such as ‘my best goal is always the next one I’m going to score’ and ‘I am not going to stop I want to reach Messi. I don’t lose sleep over it but it excites me.’

‘Reaching Messi’ will not just mean winning another Golden Ball but also another European Cup and if he does it this season then he will have gone one better than his rival by becoming one of the first players to win back to back Champions Leagues.

Both men will also be pushed on by competition from within their own clubs. In a non-World Cup year Gareth Bale will have a chance to go for major individual honours this season and Ronaldo could be travelling to Zurich with the Welshman next January. 

Bale already has a better free-kick scoring ratio – one every nine attempts over one every 15 – and it was the former Tottenham forward who stepped into Ronaldo’s shoes last season when injury kept him out of the Copa del Rey final to score the winning goal.

There seemed to be a frosty atmosphere between Messi and Ronaldo during Monday's press conference

At Barcelona, Neymar is emerging as Messi’s long-term heir and like Bale he will expect to feature at least in the team of the year at the FIFA gala in 2016.

The principle motivation for both remains the same though – being better than Messi and Barcelona for Ronaldo, and being better than Real Madrid and Ronaldo for Messi.

The two men were more comfortable in each other’s company this year than in previous ceremonies. They remain worlds apart in terms of temperament and personality. If Messi does lift the FIFA World Player award next year there will be no primal scream celebration and Ronaldo probably won’t be wearing a burgundy tuxedo. But what does seem very likely is that both men will be back on the podium. They have years ahead of them – this duel has only just have begun.
