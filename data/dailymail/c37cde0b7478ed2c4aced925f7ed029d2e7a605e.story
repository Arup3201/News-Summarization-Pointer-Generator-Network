Jose Mourinho believes new signing Cesc Fabregas will be a perfect fit at Chelsea following his move from Barcelona.

Fabregas completed his £27million switch shortly before the World Cup kicked off in Brazil, where his team Spain crashed out in the group stage.

And Mourinho thinks the former Arsenal midfielder will fit straight in at Chelsea, due to his prior experience of living and playing in England.

‘He is the kind of player we [Chelsea] need,’ Mourinho told ITV during a visit to Ivory Coast, where he is supporting the United Nations World Food Programme.

‘Not just for his qualities as a player but also his competitive personality.

‘He is a player in the best years of his career – 26, 27, 28. He knows England well, he knows the Premiership well, so he will not need time to adapt.

‘I think he is the kind of player who will come and train for a couple of weeks and be ready to prove himself.’

Rather than going to watch the World Cup in Brazil this summer, Mourinho has been visiting hungry children and HIV patients in Africa as a United Nations ambassador for the World Food Programme. 

The World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.
