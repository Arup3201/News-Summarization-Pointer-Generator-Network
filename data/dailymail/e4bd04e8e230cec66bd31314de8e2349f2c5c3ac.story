Doctors are deserting the NHS to treble their salaries working as locums, MPs warn.

A growing number are quitting their full-time hospital posts to make a career as professional agency staff.

Locums typically earn £1,760 a shift – equivalent to £240,000 a year – more than three times the £75,000 average salary for consultants.

A report by the Public Accounts Committee highlights that the NHS spent £2.6billion on agency staff last year, a rise of a quarter compared with 2012/13. Hospital bosses who spoke to the committee admitted that a rising number of doctors and nurses are choosing careers as ‘professional temporary locums’.

Andy Hardy, chief executive of University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, said: ‘There is evidence that some doctors and nurses and other professionals are making the choice to become professional temporary staff, but that is not across the whole of the country.

‘London is a special case in terms of pay rates. If I look at my own A&E, we are fully staffed at the consultant level. But there are other specialities where we have to rely on agency staff, and some of those are permanent agency staff – that is what they do for a career.’

Matthew Hopkins, chief executive of Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, in Essex, added: ‘There are staff – not just doctors, but nurses and others – who are making that choice.’

He admitted an A&E locum consultant can typically earn £110 an hour for a 16-hour shift, or £1,760. Such a locum could work three shifts a week, take six weeks of leave and still earn three times as much as a permanent staff member.

But there is concern locum doctors are not of the same high standard as full-time staff, partly because they do not know the ropes. There are also fears they may be less reliable.

Exorbitant spending on locums is partly to blame for the fact that a rising number of hospitals are in deficit, the report warns. A quarter are now in the red, compared with this time last year when the figure was only 10 per cent.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the committee, said she was concerned by the ‘fragility’ of NHS finances.

‘Between 2012/13 and 2013/14, the amount the NHS spent on temporary medical staff increased from £2.1billion to £2.6billion,’ she said.

‘For example, Barking, Havering and Redbridge NHS Trust told us that it had a 50 per cent shortage of emergency consultants and was spending £1.5million a month on temporary staff.

‘It costs the taxpayer £400,000 to train an emergency consultant, but there are claims that some consultants are choosing to leave the NHS to work on an agency basis at a substantial cost to the NHS, with typical charges of £1,760 per day.’

She added: ‘The Department [of Health] should … require NHS bodies to use agency staff within a national framework contract.’
