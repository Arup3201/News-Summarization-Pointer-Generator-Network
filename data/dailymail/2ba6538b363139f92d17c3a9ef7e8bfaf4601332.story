A motorcyclist who broke his neck and his back in a 120mph crash has stunned medics by recovering enough to train for a marathon.

Club racer Nick Matthews, 47, sustained catastrophic injuries when he forgot to tighten his brakes and sped head first into a wall.

Friends who witnessed the crash at the Oulton Park race circuit in Cheshire feared he was dead.

Nick Matthews, 47, has defied the odds to start training for a marathon after breaking his neck and back in a 120mph motorbike crash. He also broke his collarbone, sternum, six ribs, a wrist and two fingers

But after being airlifted to hospital surgeons managed to save his life and rebuild his shattered body.

However, they warned him he might not walk again.

But Mr Matthews from Market Harborough, Leicestershire, proved them wrong by walking out of hospital just three weeks later.

He is now training for a marathon despite his body being held together with screws and metal rods. 

He said: ‘My body was completely broken, but not my spirit.

‘It’s been painful and exhausting but I owe it to the guys who saved my life not to be beaten.

‘Life in a wheelchair was not an option for me. 

Mr Matthews crashed his bike head first into a wall of tyres in June last year. The accident happened because he forgot to tighten his brakes before heading out onto the track which meant they failed

Mr Matthews was taken to hospital by the air ambulance but friends who saw the crash thought he was dead

‘I won’t break any records or beat any times when I run but I will cross that finish line.’

He is hoping to raise funds for the air ambulance that saved his life.

The accident occured in June last year. Mr Matthews, a haulage firm manager who had been riding
 at club level for five years, was preparing for a race the following day
 when the accident occurred.

Broken neck

Back broken in three places

Collarbone broken in two places

Six broken ribs

Collapsed lung

Broken sternum

Broken wrist

Two broken fingers

He said: ‘I’d gone to the track a day early to put my bike through road testing and do some practice laps like normal.

‘It had been checked by the circuit and was fine.’

But while he was about to tighten his brake bolts, he was then distracted and took to the circuit without doing it.

Just seven minutes into his practice laps, he approached a corner at 120mph and went for his brakes.

Terrifyingly, he pulled them but felt no resistance at all. In that split second, he says he knew he would probably die.

Mr Matthews, whose father was killed in a motorcycle crash when he was a baby, said: ‘It was a moment of shock and horror. I pulled at the brakes and there was nothing. Blind panic washed over me.’

Mr Matthews also suffered a collapsed lung which caused him to stop breathing at the scene

Mr Matthews had to have a five-hour operation to repair his back and neck using titanium rods and screws

The terror was captured on camera thanks to a video recorder attached to his bike.

He left the circuit at 120mph and went hurtling head first into a tyre wall before being crushed by his 160kg bike.

Medics on the scene found him barely conscious but saved his life by inserting a chest drain when he stopped breathing.

He was then airlifted to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester in a critical condition where the full extent of his injuries was revealed.

Doctors didn't think Mr Matthews would survive and said even if he lived, he would probably not walk again

Not only had he broken his neck, but his back was also broken in three places as well as his collarbone, six ribs, sternum, wrist and two fingers.

He had also suffered a collapsed lung.

His wife, Kirsty, 38, mother to the youngest of this three children aged 19, 16 and seven, was warned he was unlikely to survive the next 24 hours.

She said: ‘They told me that even if he did survive he would never walk again. This was a life changing accident. I knew Nick wouldn’t want to come round if he wasn’t going to be able to walk again, sport is his life.

Mr Matthews spent three weeks in hospital before being allowed home

Mr Matthews (pictured with his wife, Kirsty, and son, Finley) has now promised that he will not return to motorbike racing - but he does hope to get back on a bike

‘The list of injuries was terrifying. They said it would be easier to work from the top down when they started listing them to me.

‘I could tell they didn’t think there was much hope.’

But doctors managed to stabilise his breathing and seven days later he was transferred to The Salford Royal Hospital for a five-hour operation to rebuild his back using titanium rods. Surgeons also fused seven vertebrae to fix the three that were broken. 

Just three days later – ten days after the smash - he stood up for the first time.

He said: ‘A physiotherapist came to see and very gently helped me to the edge of the bed.

‘I put my feet down and remember thinking how cold and flat the floor felt under me.

‘Then I just stood up. It was an amazing feeling.

‘All the consultants came to look at me standing up because they couldn’t believe it. I felt like a freak show.

‘I vowed there and then that anything was possible and one day I would run a marathon.

‘One of them joked that I must be concussed from head injuries to say such a thing because running would never be possible for me again, but I meant it.’

Mr Matthews managed to stand up again just 10 days after the crash

The following day Mr Matthews took three painful steps and managed to sit in a chair on the ward.

But when his wife came to visit and saw his empty bed – she feared the worst.

Mr Matthews said: ‘She saw the bed empty and thought I was dead. Then when she saw me sat in the armchair she smiled and I stood up in front of her for the first time.

‘She was gobsmacked and burst into tears. It was a very emotional moment for us.’

Mr Matthews is now training for a marathon to raise money for the air ambulance that saved his life

By day 16 of his recovery, Mr Matthews was able to take enough steps to leave the ward and three weeks after the smash he stunned doctors by walking out of the hospital unaided.

He says: ‘I felt like the luckiest man alive and all my friends agreed. Especially the ones who had witnessed the crash who couldn’t believe I had survived, let alone got back on my feet.’

Mr Matthews has since undergone two more operations as well as intensive physiotherapy and in January this year ran for the first time.

He says: ‘I only went twice around the block but every step took all I had, but they say a marathon is more about what is in your head so I kept going.’

He can now run two continuous miles and hopes his training schedule will see him ready for the Berlin marathon in September.

He will run with a group of friends for support.

But he has promised his family not to ride motorcycles at club level again.

He said: ‘I couldn’t put them through that worry again, not after last time.’

But he still hopes to ride motorcycles again one day.

‘My father rode a Triumph Bonneville and it’s always been a dream of mine to own one so maybe one day.’

He says: ‘My friends call me the bionic man because I am full of so much metal.

‘I owe my life to the people who saved me, rebuilt me and helped me come this far and I want to give something back by showing people what is possible and raising money for the air ambulance that got me to hospital.’
