Romeo is modelling his second campaign for Burberry at just 12 years old. The career path from celebrity son or daughter to modelling is well-trodden. He follows in the footsteps of Daisy Lowe, Kendall Jenner and Georgia Jagger  

In the UK, sons and daughters of rock royalty have been snapped up by fashion designers desperate for some of the stardust to rub off on clothing sales. 

The likes of Daisy Lowe, Peaches and Pixie Geldof and Amber Le Bon have all got several years of modelling experience under the belts. 

In the Rollings Stones camp, it's difficult to find one of the daughters who haven't strutted down a catwalk or posed for a glossy magazine advert.

But fame certainly isn't the only reason for these young men and women being signed up to agencies. 

Often, the combination of charismatic musicians with fashion models, pop stars and actors produce genetically blessed sons and daughters. 

Femail have rounded up some of the most successful celebrity offspring who tried their hands at modelling: 

Daisy Lowe, 25, the daughter of singer Pearl Lowe and musician Gavin Rossdale has had an extremely succesful modelling career. Here she fronting an advertising campaign for Karen Millen
