He is the Olympic gymnast and King of the Strictly dance floor known for his dapper style and charming looks.

So it comes as no surprise that fashion-forward Louis Smith wants to channel his signature suited-and-booted look into his own fashion line.

'I have a lot of clothes in my head that I'd like to wear, but that I don't see out there, so I'm really interested about trying to get into fashion and perhaps starting my own range,' he said.

Big plans: Olympian gymnast Louis Smith spoke about his fashion plans and hopes of starting his own line

Speaking in a London College of Fashion film promoting London Collections: Men showcase, he discussed his eclectic style.

He said: 'Men's fashion is all over the place and 
that's the beauty of it, it's not just following one track and I like to
dip my toes in all the different puddles of fashion.'

While
we are most accustomed to seeing the silver medallist in his Lycra (and since Strictly, 
more than a sprinkling of sequins), Louis makes it clear that he will 
not be filling his clothing rails with sportswear.

'You've got to look fresh in a suit, you've got to be able to busy it out,' he said.

Talking about key wardrobe essentials, the Strictly Come Dancing winner said: 'Key items for any guy is a suit, skinnies, a nice tie, bow-ties as well, and a nice fragrance.

'In Peterborough, where I'm from, I get some funny looks for the things I decide to wear, but in London anything goes.'

The 23-year-old British Olympian isn't 
the first to reveal his hopes of a foray into the world of fashion.
