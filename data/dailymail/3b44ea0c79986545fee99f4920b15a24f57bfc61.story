Zinedine Zidane's third son, Theo, appears primed to follow in the footsteps of his famous father judging by a goal he recently scored for a Real Madrid youth side.

The 12-year-old found the back of the net in the 10-2 thrashing of Moratalaz and demonstrated a prodigious first touch alongside unnerving composure to conjure memories of his father in his prime.

As a cross was floated over from the right, Theo Fernandez tucked the ball on to his right foot after a defender missed an interception before deftly placing the ball out of the reach of the goalkeeper and into the top corner.

Theo Fernandez (right) neatly controlled a high cross with a superb left-footed touch 

His control allowed him to work his way into space from just inside the penalty area  

He then placed the ball past the goalkeeper as three defenders tried to close down the space around him

Theo is not the only Zidane son looking to emulate the achievements of Zidane Snr, who won the Champions League with Madrid and the World Cup with France.

Enzo, the oldest Zidane son at 19, has already appeared for the Real Madrid B team, which is coached by Zidane Snr, who retired from playing in 2006.

As well as winning the World Cup and Champions League, Zidane Snr was named World Player of the Year three times in 1998, 2000 and 2003.
