Suburban: The crash caused smoke and flames to rise up around the surrounding area that were visible for miles

The pilot took off from Orlando Executive Airport two miles away just moments before the crash, which has left investigation teams baffled.

'We don't know what caused the accident, we just know the helicopter did go inside the guest house,' said Sgt. Wanda Ford from the Orlando Police Department to Bay News 9.

Witnesses to the crash said that the pilot appeared to be in difficulties.

'I was driving down the road, and I just saw this helicopter and it was driving really low and the propeller was still going, but you could just tell that it was about to crash,' said Emily Blomquist to Bay News 9.

'By the time I got to the street which was two streets up it had already hit the house and there was a huge cloud of smoke and people were running on the street. It was quite scary.'

'I heard this great 'whop, whop, whop,' followed by this boom. Then everything went dark,' added Donn Carr to Bay News 9.

Firefighters arrived to battle a huge blaze with flames shooting up from the home. Police said that heavy smoke was visible for several miles.

The helicopter crashed Sunday afternoon in a neighborhood of large, historic homes.  

Nobody inside the home is believed to have been hurt, though wreckage was seen strewn across the ground and a hole had been smashed in the side of the building.

Helicopter footage from local news station WFTV showed the extent of the damage.

According to the WESH news channel, Orlando firefighters said the chopper hit an apartment building in the grounds of the home, rather than the main residence.
