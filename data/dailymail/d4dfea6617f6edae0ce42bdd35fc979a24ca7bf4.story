Farmers believe labourers from Bulgaria and Romania are likely to desert the strawberry fields for better paid and more comfortable work in towns and cities

Farmers fear a strawberry shortage next summer because of the lifting of immigration rules for Romanians and Bulgarians, it was revealed today.

They believe 22,000 agricultural labourers from the two countries who currently work as summer fruit pickers are likely to desert the strawberry fields for better paid and more comfortable work in towns and cities.

As a result shops and supermarkets are at risk of running short of strawberries and other seasonal crops because there will be too few workers to harvest them.

The threat of a shortage of fruit pickers was disclosed by Home Office immigration adviser Professor David Metcalf.

Professor Metcalf said the National Farmers Union is pressing for a relaxation of immigration rules to allow tens of thousands of agricultural workers from outside Europe to come into Britain to replace the lost Bulgarian and Romanian workforce.

Citizens of the two eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2007 will be free to come to Britain and work without restriction from January next year.

Even though the lifting of migration and labour barriers against Poles and workers from seven other eastern European countries in 2004 brought between a million and a million and a half workers to Britain, Whitehall has yet to produce estimates of the numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians who may arrive.

At present, 21,750 Romanians and Bulgarians come into this country for six months of the year under the terms of the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme.

The end of restrictions on the jobs these workers can take mean that many may decide to pursue other work in Britain.

Professor Metcalf, the chairman of the Home Office's Migration Advisory Committee, said: 'The question is, in 2014, when Romanians and Bulgarians get completely free access to the labour market, will they decide that they would rather go to work in hotels, or pubs, or Tesco, and therefore will there be enough people to pick the strawberries?

'Farmers are wanting a scheme from outside the EU at a time when we have 25 million unemployed in the EU. It's a difficult one. Who's going to pick the strawberries?'

Professor Metcalf said his committee had not been asked to estimate numbers who might come from Romania and Bulgaria, although he said he did expect Downing Street to request information on why many employers prefer workers from Europe to British workers.

He said: 'My understanding is that the Foreign Office-commissioned report from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research goes through a lot of interesting economic stuff, but doesn't have numbers.'

The Migration Advisory Committee recommended that immigration rules on skilled migrants from outside Europe should be widened to allow in more engineers, including nuclear safety engineers to work in the decommissioning of old nuclear power stations, and railway signalling engineers to work on Crossrail and HS2.

It also said there were shortages in Britain of chicken sexers and computer games designers.

However, successful training in the medical profession over the past decade means there are now enough British-educated brain surgeons and other consultants, the committee's report said.
