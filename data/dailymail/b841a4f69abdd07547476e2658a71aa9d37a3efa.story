It looks like an ordinary Range Rover – but it bristles with enough gadgets to make James Bond envious.

The new armoured vehicle, dubbed the Chelsea tank, is designed to cope with small-arms fire – and even a chemical weapons attack – to foil would-be kidnappers.

With thick armour plating, gun ports and electronic jammers, the £300,000 vehicle is designed for security- conscious celebrities who don’t want to stand out in city streets.

The Range Rover Vogue has been modified by STOOF for safety-conscious celebrities to keep trouble at bay. Detailed above are some of the many features the company installs on vehicles

Stoof, the German company which has adapted the Range Rover Vogue, confirm it has also sold armoured cars to the Foreign Office and other Government agencies.

Its latest vehicle, to be launched next month at the Transport Security Expo in Olympia, is also fitted with sensors which detect a gas attack, close down the air conditioning and supply fresh oxygen.

The vehicle weighs in at five tons – with its suspension and brakes upgraded to cope.

Among other vehicles serviced by the company are limousines and off-road trucks, with references to safety in conflict zones appearing throughout its website.  

Armoured cars have become a must-have accessory for safety-conscious celebrities, some of whom have spent £200,000 on modifications to keep attackers at bay. 

Electronic shock handles, bullet-proof glass, night vision windscreens and ram bumpers are among the gadgets installed to vehicles in America. 

Singer Melanie Brown reportedly bought an armoured Escalade last year while Kanye West owns two

Singer Melanie Brown is reported to have bought one of the vehicles last year, while rapper Kanye West snapped up matching hyper-safe Escalades. 

When he was Prime Minister, Tony Blair took delivery of a fully armoured BMW 7-series — dubbed the ‘Blair Panzer’ after the German word for armour. 

Ironically, on delivery in London, police found that illegal immigrants had stowed away in the container lorry transporting it to Britain.

David Cameron has, as his official car, an armoured, top-of-the-range Jaguar XJ. But trumping them all is U.S. President Barack Obama with his gargantuan armoured Cadillac-style limousine, dubbed ‘The Beast’, which follows him around the globe on official visits.
