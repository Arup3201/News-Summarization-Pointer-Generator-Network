Pictures of these cute but feisty lion cubs show them testing out their fledgling fighting skills in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya.

The spirited youngsters were caught on camera getting their claws out for a play fight, before a mature female lion and the rest of the pride intervened.

Like real-life versions of Disney's Lion King characters Simba and Nala, the cubs tried out their best moves on each other, even managing a backflip at one point.

Wading in: The rest of the pride became embroiled as they separated the warring youngsters

Photographer Elliott Neep caught the 
touching scenes as he studied their pride over three months.

He managed to capture not just the youngsters but also the adults at play.

In his series of photographs Neep
shows Africa's top predators fighting for control of the pride.

Lions in the Masai Mara tend to live in grassland habitat, grouped into families called prides.

Although they are famous for hunting other animals they also sleep a lot and have a playful side.
