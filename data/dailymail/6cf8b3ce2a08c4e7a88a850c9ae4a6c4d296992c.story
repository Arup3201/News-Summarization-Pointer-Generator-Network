With Chris Froome out, Richie Porte steps up to become leader of Team Sky, the first time the British team has ever been led by a non-Brit at the Tour.

Porte is a tough little Tasmanian who is famous for marathon training rides, spending his 29th birthday this year, on 30 January, riding 403km - in one day.

‘Whatever comes into Richie’s head he says,’ Froome has said. ‘Richie has no filter.’

Stepping up: Australian Richie Porte will become Team Sky's first ever non-British Tour de France leader

Bandaged: Porte replaces injured 2013 Tour de France champion Chris Froome

Gutted: Froome will not get to defend his win in the Tour de France last year after his falls and withdrawal

Done: Froome calls it a day after another crash made his injuries too severe to continue

Muddy: Porte and all the riders endured a difficult fifth stage along France's cobbles

VIDEO Froome 'bitterly disppointed' with Tour withdrawal 

This could be interesting if Porte finds himself in the yellow jersey and subject to the kind of grilling the more polite and diplomatic Froome was subject to last year.

He has had an up-and-down year but Sir Dave Brailsford, the Team Sky principal, said on the eve of the Tour that Porte has hit ‘terrific form’ at just the right time.

As well as a great opportunity for Porte, Froome’s exit could present Geraint Thomas with a chance to shine.

If Porte falters, the Welshman could become team leader, not to target the podium, perhaps, but to try and bag stages and see how high he can finish on general classification.

Opportunity: Welshman Geraint Thomas can now target stage wins after Froome's withdrawal

Fresh: Thomas has never won a stage at the Tour de France but now has the opportunity to do so
