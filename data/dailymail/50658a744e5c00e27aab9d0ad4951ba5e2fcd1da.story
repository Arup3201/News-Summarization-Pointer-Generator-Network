A 25-year-old man has been arrested after troopers clocked him driving his motorcycle at 170 mph on the Thruway, authorities said.

A trooper first observed motorcyclist Nikkolaus McCarthy going 166 mph Wednesday afternoon in the southbound lanes of Interstate 87 just south of Albany, New York.

The trooper pursued the biker and was able to get the Suzuki motorcycle's license plate number and a description of the rider when he slowed down in traffic.

But the man sped off again, and other troopers clocked him going as fast as 170 mph.

According to The Saratogian, McCarthy travelled approximately 50 miles in 20 minutes before he was forced to slow down because of traffic in New Paltz.

The Times Herald-Record reported that the traffic bottle-necking at the New Paltz thruway exit forced McCarthy to slow down and yield to traffic. 

He reportedly told troopers that he was running low on fuel.

When they told him how fast he was going, McCarthy allegedly told them his motorcycle ‘could easily go over 190 miles per hour.’

Police charged Nikkolaus McCarthy of Charlton, New York with fleeing police, reckless driving, speeding and operating a motorcycle without a license.

He was being held at the Albany County Correctional Facility on $20,000 cash bail. It couldn't immediately be determined if he had a lawyer.

According to the Herald-Record, McCarthy was driving a 2007 Suzuki.

However, a spokesperson for the Thruway could not further identify the model to MailOnline.
