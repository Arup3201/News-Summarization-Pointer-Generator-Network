Team news

West Brom 

England goalkeeper Ben Foster is set to return to West Brom's starting line-up for Saturday's Barclays Premier League fixture against Crystal Palace.

Foster missed Monday's 2-2 draw with Manchester United due to a calf injury but head coach Alan Irvine revealed he is back in training and "fine" ahead of the Eagles' visit.

Winger Silvestre Varela is still out after groin surgery while midfielder Claudio Yacob is in his native Argentina due to family illness. Defender Jonas Olsson is struggling with a niggling Achilles injury.

Provisional squad: Foster, Myhill, Pocognoli, Gamboa, Dawson, Lescott, McAuley, Davidson, Wisdom, Baird, Morrison, Mulumbu, Brunt, Blanco, Sessegnon, Samaras, Ideye, Berahino.

Saido Berahino is currently the hottest prospect in England and scored against Manchester United last week

Crystal Palace

James McArthur and Scott Dann are both expected to miss Crystal Palace's trip to West Brom in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday.

McArthur and Dann are struggling with hip and knee injuries respectively while Damien Delaney is serving a one-match suspension after being sent off against Chelsea last weekend.

Delaney's absence could see Martin Kelly or Adrian Mariappa play in central defence as Palace look to avoid a third consecutive defeat.

Provisional squad: Speroni, Hennessey, Mariappa, Kelly, Fryers, Ward, Hangeland, Jedinak, Bannan, Ledley, Williams, Bolasie, Thomas, Puncheon, Gayle, Campbell, Johnson, Doyle, Chamakh, Zaha.
