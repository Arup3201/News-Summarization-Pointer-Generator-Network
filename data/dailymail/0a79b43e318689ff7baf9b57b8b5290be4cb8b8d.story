A couple have spoken out about the benefits of their 'open adoption' arrangement, which allows their son to have full contact with his biological family.

Liane Thatcher and Kerry Keane from South Orange, New Jersey, who were unable to conceive naturally, told the Today show that they went down this route because they didn't like the idea of 'having secrets.'

For the past 12 years they have been working with their son Phelan's birth mother, Moriah Dailer, 'as a team' and today the trio say their set-up provides everyone with what they need.

Indeed, Ms Thatcher says that Phelan gets double the amount of motherly love and has dozens of relatives to play with - something which he grown to appreciate.

Ms Dailer, from Washington state, was 19 years old, unmarried and a college dropout working as a waitress when she fell pregnant with Phelan.

Without the funds for an abortion she went through with the pregnancy and put her baby up for adoption.

'It's inexplicable how excited he gets and how much he literally needs his birth mother'

Over the months she became increasingly attached to her unborn son and tried to find an alternative to the traditional 'closed' or 'confidential' adoption route.

'Feeling him move the first few times, that was amazing,' she recalled.

She
was put in touch with Ms Thatcher and Mr Keane, a married couple who were keen to adopt 
but wanted to maintain ties with their child's birth parents.

They believed this would help avoid problems that can come later down the line when children go hunting for their blood relatives.

Ms Dailer told the couple that her main priority was to tell her son that she loved him one day.

'Phelan was my family and I had to pursue that,' she said.

When it was time for Ms Dailer to give birth, Ms Thatcher and Mr Keane were there in the delivery room.

'Feeling him move the first few times, that was amazing. Phelan was my family and I had to pursue that'

They selected a half-dozen names then let Ms Dailer make the final choice. Phelan Daniel Thatcher-Keane was born on September 29, 2001, weighing 7lbs and 9oz.

Since then all have been part of each other's lives.

Ms Thatcher says she is thrilled to see her son’s connection with his birth mother.

'There’s an amazing thing that happens when we get together - when Phelan first sees Moriah,' she said.

'It’s inexplicable how excited [he gets] and how much he literally needs her.'

Proving a point Phelan said: '[Moriah's] really fun to hang out with. I really love her.'

Ms Thatcher says  Ms Dailer has also been someone she has been able to share her joys and heartaches of motherhood with.

'She’s the first person I think to call - just as quickly as I call my sister.'

Despite the openness, giving up a child still had an emotional impact on Ms Dailer and she later went through therapy.

'The good news is that adoption in our country is traveling a road toward greater openness and honesty'

According to a report last year only about five per cent of infant adoptions in the U.S. now take place without some ongoing relationship between birth parent and adoptive family.

Based on a survey of 100 adoption agencies, the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute said of the roughly 14,000 to 18,000 infant adoptions each year, about 55per cent are fully open.

‘The good news is that adoption in our country is traveling a road toward greater openness and honesty,’ said Adam Pertman, the institute's executive director.

'But this new reality also brings challenges, and there are still widespread myths and misconceptions about open adoption.'

The challenges, according to Mr Pertman and other adoption experts, often involve mismatched expectations as to the degree of post-adoption contact.
