She may be the toast of the fashion world but according to public opinion even Victoria Beckham is guilty of making fashion faux pas.

A new survey, which polled 1,000 Brits about age appropriate fashion and behaviour, found that very steep high heels loved by celebrities such as Mrs Beckham, should not be worn by anyone over the age of 32. At 40, Victoria is well over the cut off.

And have you been worried you are too old for a tattoo? According to the survey, which polled 500 men and 500 women between the ages of 18 and 70, if you've turned 31, your chance is over. Someone better tell 68-year-old Helen Mirren, who brandishes an inking on her hand.

So if you don’t want to end up branded on social media as #WhitneydressedasBritney or secretly snapped and posted under #menwithponytails, read on.

The worst offences include: wearing a baseball cap if you are older than 32, men growing a goatee beard if they are older than 32 and women older than 48 wearing a bikini.

Lots of people like to recapture 
their youth in middle-age but if you don’t want to make your children 
cringe, maybe it is worth sticking to the most popular age limits in the
 survey by diet company Forza Supplements.

Having
 a tattoo is a great sign of teenage rebellion - and even the Prime 
Minister’s wife Samantha Cameron has a small dolphin on her ankle.

But most of us reckon that it is embarrassing to show off a new etching after the age of 31.

And it's not just in the wardrobe department where you have to tread carefully. Routinely ending emails or texts with a kiss (X) to strangers is also deemed embarrassing after the age of 29.

Emails and texting are another minefield of age-related etiquette.

Prime Minister David Cameron famously wrongly used the text short-form 'LOL' - thinking it meant Lots of Love and not the correct Laugh Out Loud.

But is it any wonder? After all, At 47, Cameron is 18 years too old for this kind of texting - which should stop at 29 according to the survey.

Similarly, however happy, sad, surprised or amazed you're feeling, no one should use emoticons in their texts over the age of 26.

Another politician to get it wrong was Foreign Secretary William Hague, who was ridiculed for wearing a baseball cap when he was aged 36.

He was four years over the cut off point, which the survey pinpointed at 32. Courtney Cox, is also a big fan of the headgear, even though she's wildly over the age limit having just turned 50.

Wearing a baseball cap back-to-front is even more age prohibitive with a cut off of 25.

Listening to Radio 1 is an essential part of most children’s upbringing - but any adult doing it beyond the age of 29 should think about switching to Radio 2.

Millions of women will be wearing a bikini on the beach this summer - but according to the survey women over the age of 48 should only sport all-in-ones. If you're Jerry Hall, however, you might just about get away with it, despite missing the cut off by a decade.

Crop tops, meanwhile, have an age restriction of 28 and below.

There are lots of ways that men try to turn back the clock. Growing a goatee, as 50-year-old Brad Pitt often does, is not advised after the age of 34.

David Beckham has regularly worn his hair in a ponytail, but the survey found men shouldn’t have one after the age of 29.

Luckily though, Becks has one more year to attend music festivals without becoming an embarrassment. The cut off point for going to festivals like Glastonbury is the oldest in the survey at  41, reflecting the increasing numbers of middle-aged revelers who attend.

The survey has other suggestions about  what's age appropriate in our free time. Snowboarding is fun when you are young but you should switch to skiing at 36 if you don’t want to be naff.

Anyone enjoying reality TV like The Only Way is Essex or Towie beyond the age of 31 is also deemed an embarrassment.

And when it comes to reality TV voting on programmes like The X-Factor the cut off is a mere 26-years-old.

The youngest cut off point revealed in the survey is for kissing in the street, which should be avoided beyond 25.

Other behaviour to be given an age warning included riding a skateboard (cut off point 26) and wearing a replica football shirt (37).

Forza Supplements managing director Lee Smith said: 'We are all trying to slow down the ageing process, and it is fun to recapture our youth by revisiting the hobbies and fashions of our teens.

'A cut off point of 48 for wearing bikinis does seem very harsh. Women in their 50s and 60s who have stayed in shape can look fantastic in the right bikini.'

Forza sees a 30 per cent surge in sales between May and July as million of women get ready for the beach.
