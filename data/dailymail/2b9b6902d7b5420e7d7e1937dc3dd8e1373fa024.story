An American woman has leaped overboard from a Hawaii-bound cruise ship in a bid to kill herself - sparking a massive search by the Coast Guard.

Another traveler saw the 54-year-old woman, who has not been identified, jumping from the Grand Princess cruise liner into the Pacific Ocean about 650 miles northeast of Hilo at 2pm on Wednesday.

The traveler notified staff who confirmed the incident was also captured on a security camera.

A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises said that they launched a search for the woman and the Coast Guard sent a C-130 plane to assist at 4pm - but she is presumed dead.

'This is very sad,' spokeswoman Julie Benson said. 'This was not an accident. It was apparent that she went overboard intentionally.'

The ship was bound for Hawaii on the third day of a 15-day trip that started in San Francisco, California, Benson said.

Benson said the crew turned the ship around and began searching for the woman when they were notified by a passenger. The search was continuing Wednesday evening, she said.

She added that the woman's name was being withheld pending notification of her family. She declined to provide more information on why she believes the woman jumped intentionally.

The cruise line notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Coast Guard, who sent the plane. Officials estimated the flight to the ship would take around two hours.

The Coast Guard had initially reported 
the woman's age as 30, but Benson said records with the cruise company 
indicate the woman is 54.

Princess Cruises is part of Carnival Corp & Plc, one of the largest vacation companies in the world, according to its website.

The Grand Princess, which holds 1,300 passengers, has 17 decks, is nearly 950 feet long and nearly 190 feet tall.
