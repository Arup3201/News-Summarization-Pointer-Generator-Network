Jose Mourinho believes Argentina boss Alejandro Sabella’s tactical switch at half time had a negative impact on star man Lionel Messi.

Messi failed to make a significant impact in the World Cup final defeat to Germany and Mourinho believes that is because the side was unbalanced in the second half.

Messi did have one good chance to give his side the lead in the second half, dragged his shot wide.

Argentina lost 1-0 in extra time to a Mario Gotze goal and Messi missed the chance to emulate Diego Maradona by winning a World Cup winner’s medal.

And Yahoo’s Global Football Ambassador Mourinho said: ‘I think in the first half he had fantastic options, I think and I would like to know later the reason Lavezzi stayed in the dressing room.

'I only have to believe that it was because of some injury because in the first half Argentina play with two lines of four, with Enzo Perez closing Philippe Lahm on one side and Lavezzi closing the other side and going forward too and because they were so compact with these two lines of four.

'Messi could basically walk while the team was in defensive moment and when the team recover the ball Messi had fresh legs and the energy to make the difference and create a lot.

'When Lavezzi was out for some reason, Sabella changed the system of the team, instead of Lavezzi who was playing wide he put Aguero on and in this moment the team instead of four-four and two players in attack Messi and Higuain.

'Certainly they play with three in the middle with Enzo Perez inside, Biglia and Mascherano and after that instead of four-four and two attacking players they were playing with four-three and in this moment the team lost a lot of balance and Messi had to run much more than in the beginning trying to close some spaces as well as Higuain.

'I think the team lost a little bit of balance and especially energy, energy they needed in the extra time and they hadn’t, I think they hadn’t because of this tactical imbalance situation and also they had one less day to rest and the game between Germany and Brazil was completely different than the game between Holland and Argentina.’

Looking ahead, Mourinho was impressed with France and Belgium at the tournament that he believes they will be stronger in four year’s time in Russia.

He added: ‘Four years in football is a long time, a long long time and anything can happen but I’m curious to see because the big football nations that left Brazil with very bad memories I want to see the way they react because they are going to react for sure.

‘Belgium and France, they didn’t reach the semi-finals but they show a very young team that in the next world cup the players will be in the best years of their career between 26 and 31, lots of young players with good talent in these two teams’
