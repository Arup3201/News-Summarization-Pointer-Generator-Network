Australia's remote areas should be used a nuclear dumping ground for the rest of the world, according to former prime minister Bob Hawke.

The former Labor leader made the statement in an address about his economic vision for Australia at the National Press Club address in Canberra on Wednesday.

Former prime minister Bob Hawke used his address at the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday to advocate Australia storing nuclear waste from other countries

'The one thing this country ought to do is have the disposal of nuclear waste in remote areas,' Mr Hawke said.

The former politician said his government received reports in the early '90s that highlighted that a nuclear waste disposal industry could flourish and was critical to cleaning the global environment.

'In doing good for the rest of the world we would be doing good for ourselves,' he said.

'We would get an enormous stable flow of income which could be used for the benefit of the world and our own benefit.'

The former Labor leader said storing nuclear waste would have economic benefits for Australia, while also having positive environmental impacts for the world

Mr Hawke's comments come despite Australia not producing nuclear energy, with country's only nuclear reactor located at Lucas Heights, in south Sydney.Â 

About 80 per cent of the waste produced at Lucas Heights is through the production of nuclear medicine, and includes items such containers, equipment, gloves and plastic.

The reactor is run by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, which also processes about 40 per cent of the country's low-level and some intermediate-level nuclear waste on-site.

Used fuel from the reactor is shipped overseas for permanent storage or reprocessing primarily in France and also the UK and U.S.

From 2015, waste produced from reprocessing used fuel, which had been sent to France and the UK, will be returned to Australia as intermediate-level waste and stored in a national radioactive waste management facility yet to be selected by the Federal Government.

Mr Hawke also spoke about the country's domestic politics and said states should be abolished because they are a 'blight upon the optimum development of this country'.

'The duplication and all that goes with that division of power is not in the interests of the country,' he said.

He also said it was crucial for greater bipartisanship in parliament, was seen in disdain by the Australian people.

'I think something ought to be done to lift the performance in the parliament,' he said.

During his address, Mr Hawke also reflected on his own political career.

The event was also attended by former Liberal prime minsiter John Howard, with the former politicians attending to mark the 50th anniversary of the club.
