A pet owner who kept 10 cats in some of the worst conditions an RSPCA inspector has ever seen has been banned from keeping animals for life.

Police officers and the RSPCA found the flea-infested cats in Jayne Gibson's Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, home in August last year.

The 46-year-old's home was described as being in such a squalid state that it was 'unfit for humans let alone animals'.

As well as nine surviving cats, a 10th pet was found dead and had been thrown into a box in the house.

Magistrates at North Staffordshire Justice Centre heard that the cats had been living in their own filth inside the house which had hundreds of flies buzzing around when inspectors arrived.

RSPCA Inspector Penny Baker said: 'I can categorically say this was the worst house I have been in during my entire career with the society.'

A police officer told the court it was one of the worst cases of animal cruelty they have ever dealt with.

The court heard that nine cats were rescued and later treated by a vet - some had scabs on their bodies due to a flea infestation, some had suffered hair loss, and one had cat flu.

The police officer said: 'I have never been in a house in such a state. It was difficult to describe the true extent of the situation.

His uniform had to be burned after visiting the house.

Claire Aldridge, prosecuting, said: 'As the RSPCA inspector approached the house, neighbours had voiced their concerns about the number of cats there.

'And the vet who treated the cats described the flea infestation on the animals as exceptional.'

But Simon Davies defending denied that her cruelty was deliberate and said that the situation had got out of hand when she began taking in stray cats.

He said: 'This was not a deliberate act. She often went without food herself so that the cats could eat, but things got out of hand.

'She has kept animals for years but has never come to the notice of the court. She has signed the cats over to the RSPCA for re-homing.'

Gibson pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary cruelty to cats.

She also admitted a third offence of failing to ensure animals in her care were provided with a suitable hygienic environment.

She was given a 12-month community order with supervision, ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work and told she must also pay £240 costs.
