So, how did Dry January work out for you? Did you storm through to February smug and sober? Or were there some booze-soaked, Saturday-shaped slip-ups along the way (guilty)?

Whether you are now a Dryathlon champion, or careered off the wagon early doors, chances are that you attempted to curb your drinking, or at least thought about it a bit more.

And just because it's February doesn't mean that good intent should go to waste. Now is actually the best time to look at your drinking and make a few changes that you can stick to for 2015 and beyond.

Curbing your drinking habits? Here FEMAIL blogger Toni Jones explains how to stay sober and sociable

My own new booze rules include drinking on only three days of the week, and a 'three drink rule' on any drinking nights that aren't a Friday. 

Not exactly earth-shattering, but a big deal to me (and already being severely tested by friends determined to retox in February). 

Club Soda is a social network for people who want to make changes to their drinking - whether that's giving up entirely or just cutting down for health, weight or money reasons. 

Founder Laura Willoughby started the club when she decided to give up drinking three years ago and realised there was very little online to support her. 

She says: 'Run a marathon, lose weight, stop smoking - they all have a host of tools and forums, but I drew a blank on drinking.

'I did not want to go to AA, for many reasons I felt it was not for me. But I also did not want to enter the health service - as far as I was concerned, that was for people with real problems. I could not get a picture of what it was they would offer to support me to help myself.

'A behaviour change approach gave me the power to make the change I wanted. Now I want to use that knowledge to build a movement, developing tools that people can tailor to their needs, and growing a social network that can support their journey.

'Behaviour change when it comes to drinking is not easy. But starting by joining in the community effort of a dry January gave you a head start.

'So whether you managed the whole month or not take heart. You changed something. You tested it out. You felt a little of what it can be like to not drink on a night out or wake up without a hangover. You can do it again.'

HOW TO CHANGE YOUR DRINKING AND STILL HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE by CLUB SODA

1. Check in weekly and set your battle plan

Once you've set your goal, it helps to track your progress regularly. This is good for keeping an eye on how you're doing, and whether you're moving towards reaching your goals. 

It is also an opportunity to reflect on the past, and prepare for the future: What has been easy and what has been difficult? What could you do differently? Is there anything else you need to change in your life? It may help you work out your trigger times and know what you will do instead. 

Club Soda member Lucy said: 'I completely changed up my routine as there were times when the cravings would crescendo so for me it was between 6-8pm. I would go for a run, go food shopping, get online and read sober blogs, get in the bath, go to the cinema. 

'Sober treats are a great way of rewarding yourself too so that you don't feel deprived - a nice coffee or chocolate bar or cake (in my case).'

2. Be a social animal

Good news, you don't have to sit in a darkened room on your own. A whiff of a fine merlot will not turn you into a gremlin. In fact staying the wonderful fun-loving human being you are is important to success. 

You may just need to try some new things and be more ambitious about the things you do with your time. 

Find interesting events where drinking is not the star of the show. After all, you can now drive to and from an event a bit out of town if you have wheels. 

The website also recommends rewarding yourself in ways other than a stiff drink

The Club Soda blog has lists for lots of places in the UK and MeetUp and Eventbrite are two useful resources for finding new things to do. Yoga, dancing, walking and even gardening feature high on the new passions of energised Club Soda members.

Have a local? Ask them to get in what you want to drink (what's the worst that they can say?).

Mix up pub visits by starting a booze-free pub social. Having one non-drinking night a month in the pub will help you stay strong the rest of the time.

And try to chat to others with similar goals online, where you will find useful tricks and helpful tips, and your common goals will encourage you all.

3. Put nice things in your mouth

Giving up alcohol may cause big changes in your body that you didn't expect. So you may want to think about your diet as well. 

Some of your cravings will be psychological (you are used to holding a glass in your hand and sipping something) and some will be physiological (you are quaffing far less calories and less sugar).

So plan nice things to eat, such as the best quality chocolate. Stock up your fridge and cupboard.

Discover new drinks. While some swear by juice and soda in the pub, your thing may be a heady of mix of ginger beer, lime and fizzy water. 

If you are used to having a pint glass in your hand, then ask for your drink by the pint. Founder Laura likes to take her own posh teas with her into a pub, and ask for hot water in a pint glass.

Make it a voyage of discovery. The good news is that the alternatives are getting better and better all the time. Non-alcoholic beers are a million times tastier than they used to be (top tip: you can trust German quality here as well!).

4. Take care of yourself

Cut yourself some slack if you aren't always perfect, or if you don't reach your goals straight away. We know from our experience that it can take several attempts, and trying many different approaches, to fully change your drinking. But we also know that every step, no matter how small, will help you to get there.

And we want to shout from the rooftops that you should never feel guilty, but instead be nice to yourself. If you are gutted that you did not do so well this week, then take a nice bath, watch your favourite movie, go for a massage.

Even doing a little bit of mindfulness can be a reward, as well as a great aid in supporting you achieve your goals. Guilt won't help you succeed, but taking care of yourself will.

… and ask for help when you need it

Some people are lucky, they are able to change their drinking on their own. Good for them! But if you need a helping hand then seek out some experts: life coaches, nutritionists, many kinds of therapists even yoga instructors have specialist skills that could make all the difference.
