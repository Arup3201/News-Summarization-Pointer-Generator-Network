A New York rapper once affiliated with hip hop star 50 Cent was gunned down in an ambush in Queens Friday that has left three others wounded.

Jamal Green, known by his stage name Mazaradi Fox, was killed when a gunman in a black ski mask opened fire on an SUV he was in at the corner of Farmers Boulevard and 133rd Avenue just after 4pm, according to police.

Investigators said the mortally wounded 42-year-old rapper climbed out of the vehicle and collapsed on the snow-covered sidewalk, where he died.

Condolences: 50 Cent tweeted to his 7.4million followers that he was saddened to hear of Fox's death

The mid-day attack has left three other passengers riding in the SUV injured, including a 22-year-old man who was struck in the neck and shoulder, the New York Daily News reported.

Another 22-year-old victim suffered a gunshot wound to the arm, while a woman in her 20s was grazed by a bullet. 

The two wounded men and woman were rushed to Jamaica Medical Center for treatment and are expected to survive. 

Police are still searching for the shooter, who was last seen fleeing the crime scene in a dark Hyundai sedan.

Mazaradi Fox was signed to 50 Cent's G-Unit record label in 2007 and appeared on several mixtape tracks with members of the crew, MTV.com reported.

The rapper never released an official album and left his famous childhood friendâ€™s label a year later.

On Friday, the award-winning performer known to his fans as Fif tweeted to his 7.4million followers: 'Saddened by the news of Mazaradi's tragic passing my thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.'

Too young: Fox helped raise D'aja Robinson, 14, who was shot dead in May aboard a Queens bus

Even though they had parted ways, 50 Cent helped pay for the funeral of Foxâ€™s 14-year-old stepdaughter, D'aja Robinson, who was shot dead while riding a bus in Queens last spring.

The 42-year-old has had several run-ins with the law over the years. Court records indicate that Fox  was released from prison December 20 after serving a two-year sentence for an attempted assault. In 1998, he was convicted of attempted murder.

In a jailhouse interview in the summer, Fox said that he was hoping to make a comeback after regaining his freedom.
