A gang who were caught on camera breaking into a family’s home in the middle of the day returned three days later - to steal their Audi.

The four men knocked on the door of the house in Farnworth in Bolton, Greater Manchester, to check no one was home before attempting to use a screwdriver to break in.

It is thought the house had been targeted for the Audi cars parked outside after the thieves ignored a laptop and iPad.

Video footage taken from cameras fitted at the property show the men climbing over the garden gate and attempting to break in through the back door at around 2pm on Wednesday.

After unsuccessfully picking the lock they use the screwdriver to smash the patio doors before running in and out in two minutes.

A piggybank, briefcase containing jewellery, documents and spare keys to the family’s two Audis were all taken in the raid.

But the family-of-four, who do not wish to be identified, had not realised the spare keys were missing until thieves returned three days later and stole their black Audi A5 convertible.

The family were at home on Saturday when the thieves strolled up the drive and casually unlocked one of the Audis before driving away.

It has since been found but the victims are appealing for anyone who recognises the thieves to contact police.

They have since moved their other car to hidden location and had the lock code changed while their spare keys are in the thieves’ possession.

The 42-year-old homeowner said: ‘The kids are completely shaken up at the moment.

‘If anyone was in the area on Wednesday or Saturday and saw what happened or recognises these men I would just ask them to contact police on 101.’

The family had not noticed the spare keys had been stolen by thieves (pictured leaving the property on Wednesday, September 24) until the car was take on Saturday, while they were still at home

The black Audi A5 convertible has since been recovered but the family has issued these images in a bid to capture the gang of four, who are seen wearing hoodies and caps to disguise their identity

The family, who do not wish to be identified, say their children have been left 'shaken up' by by break-in
