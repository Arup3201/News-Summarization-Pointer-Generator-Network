John Terry used Saturday’s programme notes to pay homage to Lord Attenborough ahead of Chelsea’s first home game after the film director passed away.

The Oscar-winning Blues fan died at the age of 90 last month and Chelsea have been keen to decorate his life.

They dedicated the front of their programme before facing Swansea City at Stamford Bridge to Attenborough, with the captain choosing to start his address to pen a few words - continuing the classy fashion with which they have marked the legend’s passing.

John Terry used Saturday’s programme notes to pay homage to Chelsea fan Lord Attenborough

‘We have lost a huge Chelsea fan, our Life President but, more importantly a tremendous man,’ Terry wrote.

‘Until the past few years he and his family were always here supporting us and he would come down to the dressing room and the manager always welcomed him.

‘He had many fond memories of the great teams he was involved with, which the players loved to hear, and he had great relationships with the old players and current ones as well.

As well as John Terry, Jose Mourinho and other Chelsea greats paid tribute to Attenborough.

‘What he did in the film world was unbelievable and films I watched growing up my kids now watch and they are still greats.

‘He was a true gentleman and will always be remembered. He meant the world to us and I know Chelsea Football Club meant the world to him.’ 

Chelsea wore black armbands and held a minute's appreciation before kick-off, while club greats Ron Harris, Tommy Docherty and Gianfranco Zola also paid tribute in the programme.
