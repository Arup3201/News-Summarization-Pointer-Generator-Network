Connor Essam was Dover's hero as the Conference side dumped League Two Cheltenham Town out of the FA Cup.

The Kent side will line up alongside the likes of Manchester United and Liverpool in Monday night's third round draw after their deserved win at Whaddon Road.

When Cheltenham failed to clear Nicky Deverdics' cross seven minutes from time, captain and centre-half Essam turned inside the box and finished in front of the delirious travelling fans.

Bradford City 4 Dartford 1

Bristol City 1 AFC Telford United 0

Cheltenham Town 0 Dover Athletic 1

Scunthorpe United 1 Worcester City 1

Southport 2 Eastleigh 1

They will be joined in the draw by fellow non-league sides Blyth Spartans, Southport, Aldershot, Chester, Gateshead and Worcester City.

Conference North Worcester, who knocked Coventry City out in the first round, conjured more Cup heroics, with Daniel Nti earning them a replay with Scunthorpe United.

The League One strugglers opened the scoring when Paddy Madden poked the ball into an empty net after Nathan Vaughan had turned Miguel Llera's curling free-kick onto the crossbar.

But when Scunthorpe failed to clear their lines inside the penalty area a minute into the second half, Nti pounced to equalise and earn a replay at Aggborough.

Worcester manager Carl Heeley said: 'All we said was 'no regrets today, let's do ourselves justice'. We didn't do that in the first-half but in the second you could tell what a good side we are. We're on a roll.

'It's a tough game to come at home but we've got a chance.'

Conference side Chester held League One Barnsley to a goalless draw at Oakwell and had chances to win it.

Ben Heneghan saw a close-range finish disallowed for offside in the second-half while Craig Mahon saw an effort deflected onto the crossbar by a Barnsley defender.

Conference Aldershot, conquerors of Portsmouth in the last round, held Rochdale to a goalless draw at the Recretation Ground.

The hosts created many of the chances, with Brett Williams seeing two second-half efforts saved by Dale keeper Conrad Logan before Glenn Wilson and Dan Holman went close late on. 

Aldershot manager Andy Scott told the BBC: 'We probably had the four best chances. We kept going and they didn't really create something in the second half.

'Rochdale's goalkeeper was probably the man of the match. How he has made some of those saves I do not know. We should have won but we're in the hat for the next round.' 

Southport came from behind to beat fellow Conference team Eastleigh and book their spot in the third round.

James Constable bundled home from five yards to give Eastleigh the lead after Craig McAllister had rounded Southport goalkeeper David Raya.

But the Merseyside-based club equalised in first-half stoppage time when Richard Brodie headed in David Fitzpatrick's right-wing cross.

And Southport won it when Micah Evans fired into the roof of the net after Brodie's initial effort struck the post.

Earlier in the day, Conference Gateshead ended Warrington Town's Cup ambitions as goals from Matty Pattison and Danny Wright sealed their passage.

Three divisions and 79 places split the hosts from their Northern Premier League Division One North opponents, who eliminated League Two Exeter in the first round.

South African midfielder Pattison finished high into the net after eight minutes after Rob Ramshaw had got the better of Craig Robinson near the touchline and pulled the ball back.

But they needed a stoppage time second from Wright to overcome Warrington's spirited resistance. It was a moment to forget for goalkeeper Karl Wills, who tried to launch a late Warrington assault but saw his clearance fall straight to Wright, who finished into an empty net.

Warrington were backed by over 1,000 fans at the Gateshead International Stadium but their FA Cup run came to an end 

AFC Telford United were left heart-broken as Kieran Agard's stoppage time goal saw League One title challengers Bristol City through at their expense.

Agard fired home left-footed into the bottom corner to deny the Conference side a replay on home territory.

Bradford City made light work of Conference side Dartford, winning 4-1 at Valley Parade.

Billy Clarke set the Bantams on their way after nine minutes and John Stead doubled the lead on the half-hour.

Two goals within the space of a minute by Filipe Morais and Mark Yeates killed the contest, though Lee Noble did score a consolation for the Darts.

Sean Rigg's second-half goal sent AFC Wimbledon through at the expense of Wycombe in an all-League Two affair. It is the first time the Dons have reached the third round in their 12-year existence. 

Northern Premier League Blyth Spartans created headline news on Friday night when they stunned League Two Hartlepool United 2-1.
