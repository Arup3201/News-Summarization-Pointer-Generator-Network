President Barack Obama has continued an annual family tradition by helping to pack bags of food and distribute them to the needy on Thanksgiving eve.

Obama, his wife Michelle, daughters Malia and Sasha, and his mother-in-law, Marian Robinson, last night dropped in on the Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB), one of the largest serving the Washington area.

They dropped bundles of sweet potatoes, onions, carrots and apples into reusable bags people held open as they walked by.

They also handed out small white boxes stamped with the presidential seal that contain M&M's candy.

Obama wished people a 'Happy Thanksgiving' and Malia shook their hands.

It's the third straight Thanksgiving that Obama and his family have helped out at this particular food bank.

Obama was spending the holiday at the White House.

In 2012, the CAFB distributed 45 million pounds (20 million kilos) of food, or 37.5 million meals, helping nearly 500,000 people.Â

It moved last year into a new 
123,000-square-foot (11,400-square-meter) warehouse after being forced 
to turn away millions of pounds of donated food because its former 
warehouse, half as big, lacked the capacity.

Food
pantries and charities are bracing for higher demand after lawmakers 
slashed $5 billion from the nation's largest hunger safety net.

And
lawmakers aimed at trimming the US budget deficit are contemplating 
more cuts to food stamps for the poor - formally the Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program - an initiative that helps feed almost 48 
million, or one in seven Americans.

Under
the SNAP cuts, a four-person household, for example, loses $36 a month,
or about 21 meals, according to the Center on Budget and Policy 
Priorities.

In the US capital, one in three children struggles with hunger - the second-worst rate after New Mexico, according to Feeding America.

The nationwide network of 200 food banks says the number of low-income people it feeds annually grew 46 percent from 2006 to now, from 25 million people to 37 million.

In Washington, the hub of one of the nation's wealthiest regions, legions of the homeless line up daily in front of charity-run food trucks.

Soup kitchens and food pantries are racing to meet demand from the growing numbers of those suffering from 'food insecurity' - the term used by the US Department of Agriculture that runs the SNAP program.

Spared the oven: Earlier in the day, Barack Obama gave the annual presidential pardon to the national Thanksgiving turkey Popcorn at the White House

Earlier in the day, Mr Obama spared two turkeys from the brine and the oven yesterday, fulfilling the annual tradition of a presidential pardon for a couple of lucky birds ahead of Thanksgiving Day.

Obama pardoned Popcorn, who shared the stage with the president on the North Portico of the White House on a cold, drizzly day.

An alternate turkey, named Caramel, also received a pardon, though it did not have the benefit of a face-to-beak meeting with the president.

'The office of the presidency, the most powerful position in the world, brings with it many awesome and solemn responsibilities,' Obama began. 'This is not one of them.'

The two turkeys, 38lb gobblers hatched the same day on a farm in Badger, Minnesota, were each up for top billing as the national Thanksgiving turkey.

After an online White House crowdsourcing election, Popcorn won.

The turkeys will be on display at George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens through January 6.

Presidents have spared turkeys off and on as far back as the Lincoln era, according to the White House.

The first official pardon was granted by President George HW Bush.
