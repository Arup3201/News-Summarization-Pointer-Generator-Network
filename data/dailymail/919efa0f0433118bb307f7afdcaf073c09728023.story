Nathan Cleverly's hotly-anticipated rematch with Tony Bellew at Liverpool's Echo Arena has sold out in under a record-breaking 48 hours.

The bout, which takes place on November 22, sees the bitter rivals fight at crusierweight - three years after Cleverly won the original fight via majority decision in the same city in October 2011 at light-heavyweight.

The Arena confirmed that not only has the event broken the record as the fastest selling sporting event held at the huge Merseyside venue, but that it is one of the quickest selling spectacles they have staged since opening in January 2008.

'It is huge news Cleverly vs Bellew is 48-hour box office sell out, making it the fastest selling sporting event in the Echo Arena's history,' said promoter and Sportsmail columnist Eddie Hearn.

'We had a little taste of the action this week and with same major announcements coming next week, those lucky enough to have grabbed a ticket and those watching at home are in for a wonderful night of British boxing.

'The atmosphere in the Echo Arena on November 22 will be breathtaking.'

Speaking at the press conference promoting the fight Welshman Cleverly, who lost his WBO light-heavyweight title in a knockout defeat to Sergey Kovalev last year, is adamant he will beat Bellew again but this time by knockout.

He said: 'Many people have asked me why I am going back to Liverpool to fight Tony Bellew again and the answer is simple - I don't like him.

'He talks too much and although I've beaten him before in front of his home fans, I am going to KO him this time around. He will not hear the final bell, I can guarantee you that.

'I will deal with him all over again and become a two-weight world champion.'

Bellew, who suffered a jolting loss at the hands of Adonis Stevenson in Quebec last November, insists he will claim a victory comprehensive enough to send his nemesis into retirement.

The home favourite, who has bounced back with two low-key stoppage wins over Valery Brudov in March and Julio Cesar Dos Santos in July since losing to Stevenson, said: 'I have been waiting for this fight for three years and now it is here revenge is the only thing on my mind.

'This is a chapter in my life that I need to close and I will do that by ending Nathan Cleverly's career on November 22.

'I am in the sport to be successful and win titles but this fight means more to me than any of that - this is personal, and he will not want to enter a boxing ring after I have finished with him.'
