The former National Security Agency contractor who disclosed a highly classified 
surveillance program has had his U.S. passport revoked.

A  U.S. official on Sunday said Edward Snowden's passport was annulled before 
he left Hong Kong for Russia. Snowden's travel plans could be complicated – but 
not thwarted – by a lack of passport.

The U.S. official said that if a senior 
official in a country or airline ordered it, a country could overlook the 
withdrawn passport.

Passport denied: The U.S. government has revoked the passport of whistle-blower Edward Snowden

The former contractor is said to be in Moscow and his allies at anti-secrecy 
WikiLeaks say Snowden is bound for Ecuador. The foreign minister there says he 
has requested asylum.

The U.S. official would only discuss the passport on the condition of 
anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter.

Earlier today, an Aeroflot flight from Hong Kong 
believed to be carrying Edward Snowden landed in Moscow.

Russia's state 
ITAR-Tass news agency cited an unnamed Aeroflot airline official as 
saying Snowden was on Flight SU213, which landed on Sunday afternoon.

Snowden had been in hiding in Hong Kong for several weeks since he 
revealed information on the highly classified spy programs. The 
WikiLeaks anti-secrecy group said it was working with him and he was 
bound for an unnamed 'democratic nation via a safe route for the purpose
of asylum.'

The White House had no immediate comment about the departure, which 
came a day after the United States made a formal request for his 
extradition and gave a pointed warning to Hong Kong against delaying the
process of returning him to face trial in the U.S.

The Department of Justice said only that it would 'continue to 
discuss this matter with Hong Kong and pursue relevant law enforcement 
cooperation with other countries where Mr. Snowden may be attempting to 
travel.'

The Hong Kong government said in a statement that Snowden left 'on 
his own accord for a third country through a lawful and normal channel.'
