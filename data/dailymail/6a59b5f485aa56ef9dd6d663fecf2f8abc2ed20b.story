The U.S. is bracing itself for freezing temperatures and snow as a polar vortex heads southwards - bringing temperatures that are expected to plunge 10- to 20-degrees below normal.

The mild weather much currently being experienced in much of the country is forecast to end on Sunday, when a vast pocket of extremely cold air will hit the Central and Eastern States and keep them in its icy grip until Friday.

A polar vortex is a massive cyclone that circles the planet's geographical poles. The Northern Hemisphere vortex often contains two extremely cold low pressure centres, one near Baffin Island, Canada, and the other over northeast Siberia in Russia.

Occasionally, this area of frigid air can get dislodged farther south than usual, leading to cold outbreaks in Canada and the U.S.

Parts of New England near the Canadian border from New York to Maine could see some snowfall.

AccuWeather Long Range Expert Paul Pastelok said: 'Areas from the northern and central Plains to the Great Lakes, the upper Gulf Coast and the Appalachians will feel significant impact from the arctic outbreak.'

Worst hit will be Fargo, North Dakota, and the cities of Minneapolis, Chicago, St. Louis and Cincinnati.

Americans are warned to take steps to combat hypothermia and frostbite in the north, and southern states are being urged to break out the winter coats.

'It is possible single-digit low temperatures occur in parts of the northern Plains and the Upper Midwest, away from the Great Lakes with temperatures plunging to 20 degrees below average in parts of the South,' Mr Pastelok said.

Cold air passing over the relatively warm waters of the Great Lakes will result in localised snow and squalls from the Upper Midwest to the interior Northeast.

Mr Pastelok said: 'A broad area of snow on the ground would result in significantly lower temperatures.'
