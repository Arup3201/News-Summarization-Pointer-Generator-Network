State fire officials say 35 horses were killed when fire swept through stables at a property in north-west Georgia on Thursday night.

Georgia Fire Marshal spokesman Glenn Allen said the blaze occurred at Happy Valley Farms owned by Marion 'Bit' Hutcheson in Rossville, just south of the Georgia-Tennessee border.

Reports say damage was estimated at up to $4.1 million due to the valuable show horses housed in the stable, some of which were worth up to $200,000, and the two buildings and storage facility that were destroyed.

Devastating: Investigators survey the scene of a fire at Happy Valley Farms near Rossiville, Georgia where 35 show horses died

According to CatwalkChatt.com, neighbors on Happy Valley Road reported two loud explosions or booms, and the barn was engulfed in flames by the time 911 was called at 8:39pm.

At one time, there were 50 firefighters battling the blaze.

Walker County fire investigators surveyed the scene early Friday 
morning and sought the help of a local meteorologist to check the barn’s
GPS coordinates against lightning strike data.

The cause of the fire remains unknown, but lightning has been ruled out as a cause.

Staff and neighbors attempted to free the horses from the stables but were held back by smoke.

Trainer Daniel Jenner says the structure was engulfed within 20 minutes but he and another trainer managed to get one of the horses out.

The horses were all American Saddle-bred horses owned by Bit Hutcheson, according to CBS Atlanta. Marion 'Bit' Hutcheson, the owner of Happy Valley Farm, 'is widely respected in the Saddlebred horse industry,' Bob Funkhouser, editor of a weekly breed publication told The Chattanooga Times Free Press.'Happy Valley Farm is one of the most widely regarded in the country,' he said Friday.

'Bit dedicated her life to breeding and raising world-class Saddlebreds. The industry has benefited from her passion and commitment, and we all share in her loss.'

'Ms. Hutcheson is doing as well as can be expected. She's awfully numb right now,' trainer Danny Jenner told CBS.

The colt barn and broodmare barn were not affected by the blaze.

Glenn Allen said two stables and a storage facility were destroyed in the fire.

The cause was still under investigation Friday afternoon but investigators have said it does not look suspicious.
