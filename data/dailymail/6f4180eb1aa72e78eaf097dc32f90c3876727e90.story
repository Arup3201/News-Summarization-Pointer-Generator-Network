He's just become an all American hero - but she's a patriotic Brit through and through. 

Tim Howard's new girlfriend is a Scottish university graduate who once went on a drunken rant on live TV about how much she loves the British royal family.

Stunning model Sara McLean, 24, met the U.S. team's World Cup goalkeeper at a party about a year ago and the pair have been going out ever since.

She is a former Miss Edinburgh and Big Brother contestant who shocked housemates on the reality show when she gave a tearful rendition of God Save The Queen, before going on a rant about people who hate the royal family.

Howard has become the most talked about soccer player in the U.S since his team's run of results in Brazil, but in the UK - where McLean lives - he is just another top flight player.

Football philistine: McLean admits that she never watched 'football' before she and Howard began dating

The 24-year-old, who broke shattered her leg last year in a road accident, even admits she knows close to nothing about football, and says their connection is about a lot more than sports. 

Despite the U.S. team's failure to move on past the quarter-finals, McLean says £1.5million-a-year Howard, 35, is 'over the moon' with the way he played. 

During the last match against Belgium, the Everton star broke the record for most saves in a World Cup match with 16.

'We don’t really talk about football that much, to be honest. I didn't even watch football before we started going out,' McLean told The Scottish Sun.

'He just laughs if I ever ask him anything about football.'

According to Page Six, McLean, who came second in the 2011 Miss Scotland Pagaent and later appeared on British reality show Big Brother, couldn't get time off from her job to go and support her man in Brazil for the World Cup, but says he understands.

He owns a flat in Manchester, in the north-west of England, while she lives in London after she moved down from her hometown in Scotland.

But the pair are going to be seeing a lot more of each other over the next four years, after Howard signed a new contract with Everton this summer.

But beauty queen McLean, originally from Newington in Edinburgh, doesn't intend to rest on her laurels and become a WAG.

'I like to work and make my own money,' McLean said. 'I never like to be dependent on anyone.'

The New Jersey-born Howard has a son Jacob, eight, and daughter Ali, seven, who both live with their mother, his ex-wife Laura Liebenrood in Tennessee.

McLean told the Sun that she hasn't ruled out a move to the U.S. after Howard's UK contract ends.

'We’ve spoken about it a couple of times. It would depend on where in life I am, and what opportunities there would be in America for me and my job. We’ll just have to see what happens,' she said.

Last year the former Miss Edinburgh, whose 62-year-old civil engineer father Colin tragically died from lung cancer three years ago, had her leg shattered in an alleged hit-and-run.

McLean was rushed to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary - where she underwent tests for brain damage - after the incident in July 2013.

She later revealed her leg was broken in four places, but insisted her injuries could have been much worse.

Former beauty queen Sara McLean was reduced to tears about the Queen when she made her fellow housemates sing the national anthem after getting drunk on Big Brother two years ago. 

They looked on in shock as she sobbed: 'I love the Queen so much.

'She's got good humour and she works. She's worked until 86 and half the people in Britain don't even work.

'When Prince William got married it was the happiest day of my life. When Prince Philip got sick I got really emotional.

'It's the one thing in my life that I'm really passionate about.

'People like basketball or like baking cookies. I like the Queen.'

McLean also blasted the antiroyalists.

She ranted: 'When people say that they hate them, it's not nice. When I watch the Royal Family it makes me so proud.

'I hate the thought of people voting out the Royal Family. If something like that happened I don't know how I'd cope.'

She said: 'Initially, doctors feared I had sustained brain damage but that was ruled out  morning after lengthy tests.

'My left leg is broken in four places and, although that has been agony, I'm almost thankful it's the only damage. I'm lucky to be alive.'  

On Big Brother, McLean appeared alongside a former porn star, a plus-size model and a one-time LA gang member, before eventually coming fourth after spending two months in the house.

Before going on the Five show, McLean declared her love for Margaret Thatcher. She also admitted being argumentative and having a short temper.

One downside to being there was that McLean missed her graduation in marketing management from Edinburgh's Napier University.

On the show she confessed to an obsession with the Queen and left housemates baffled with a drunken rant backing the monarchy.

And at one point she threatened to punch model Arron Lowe after he talked about pouring the housemates' alcohol down a drain.

One of the first things she did when she left the house was to watch the Queen's cameo with Daniel Craig at the Olympics opening ceremony.

McLean said: 'I watched the Queen with James Bond and it was brilliant -she proved why she's great for Britain.

'When Prince William got married it was the happiest day of my life. When Prince Philip was ill I got really emotional. It's the one thing in my life that I'm passionate about.'

McLean attended Edinburgh's George Watson's College, which charges annual fees of around £9,800, before moving to another school, St Margaret's.
