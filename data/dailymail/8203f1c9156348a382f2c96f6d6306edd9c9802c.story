British Gas may be making unsolicited phone calls to more than four million homes every year, a survey found yesterday.

The energy giant, which made profits of more than £600million last year, was among the biggest users of cold calling, according to the research.

The marketing calls are often regarded as a nuisance or even sinister.

There has been particular concern over ‘silent’ calls, when householders pick up the phone but no voice speaks to them.

The scale of marketing calls was estimated following a survey carried out in 20,000 homes where an answering unit was fitted to record the number of incoming calls.

British Gas was among the most prolific callers, the results showed.

It made 7,000 cold calls to 900 homes over the course of a year, almost eight calls to each household.

If unsolicited calls from British Gas are made on the same scale nationwide, researchers calculated, it is likely to have made calls to 4.1million homes.

Its involvement in the unpopular marketing approach threatens fresh embarrassment for the firm at a time when its high profit levels have been attracting criticism.

Figures published last week showed profits of £606million, swelled by increased energy use during the first months of the cold winter, and a 6 per cent price increase in November.

The profits were the equivalent of £50 for every one of the 12million homes which buy energy from British Gas.

Tory MP Alan Cairns told the Sunday 
Telegraph, which commissioned the study, that: ‘Certain groups of people, particularly the elderly who may 
be at home all day, will not answer their telephone unless they 
recognise the number because they are so concerned about nuisance calls.

'Some people tell me that they are getting five or six of these sorts of calls every day.

‘And when these calls are silent that 
causes real concern for the elderly who first thought may be that it is 
someone they know who is in trouble and can’t speak or that it is 
someone out to frighten and intimidate them. This simply cannot be 
allowed to continue.’

The company said yesterday: ‘This is a highly regulated area and we take our obligations extremely seriously.

'When we do call our customers it is always with their permission or when we have undertaken all relevant checks to confirm consent.

'We uphold the highest standards of customer service and when calling it is to offer people information on products and services that may save them money or offer peace-of-mind, such as boiler care.’

A spokesman added that the company was using new calling systems to stop silent calls.

These play a recorded announcement if the system believes a real person rather than an answering machine has picked up the call.

Silent calls happen when an automated unsolicited sales call is made to a number with the intention that a salesman or woman will speak to them.

However, when the householder answers the phone, all the call centre sales staff are already tied up on other calls. As a result, the individual who picks up the phone hears only a potentially threatening silence.

British Gas said: ‘We have invested heavily in state-of-the art technology which stops silent calls.’

Other companies making heavy used of unsolicited sales calls are Homeserve, TalkTalk and Npower, the survey carried out for the Sunday Telegraph found.

Rules on unsolicited sales calls are set by the regulator Ofcom, which has fined companies for making silent calls, but has not named companies which made them.

These companies are usually specialist operators working for household name businesses.

The regulator allows sales operators to make three per cent of their calls ‘silent’ calls in which nobody speaks to the recipient.
