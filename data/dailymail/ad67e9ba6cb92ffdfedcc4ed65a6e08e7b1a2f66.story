Former champion swimmer Michael Klim has posted a photograph on Social Media pretending to be arrested by what appears to be a Victorian State Police officer, a stunt which has already been proved controversial this year when it was found to 'breach strict police protocols'.

Klim was photographed leaning against a paddy wagon after a day at the races, whilst a smiling officer in uniform pretended to handcuff him.

The photo briefly appeared on his Instagram account with the caption: 'Oh dear... #busted #bigday #jailbait'.

The 37-year-old had spent the day at Melbourne's Derby Day races, celebrating in style with his wife, entrepreneur and model Lindy Klim.

He quickly deleted the photo when commenters began to point out that Lily Allen had already tried to make that joke this year and it had not been well-received. 

Although the photograph may look like a bit of fun, the AFP came under fire in July for posing for a similar photograph Allen.

An Australian police launched an internal investigation into the incident, as the police officer involved had breached strict protocol by pretending to handcuff the celebrity.

Allen posted the photograph of her fake arrest on Social Media during her Australian tour; taken after she landed at Gold Coast Airport in Queensland. 

Lily Allen and Australian Federal Police staged a fake arrest at Gold Coast Airport on Sunday. The Instagram photo was tweeted to her 4.7 million Twitter followers

A number of Federal Police officers were on hand to escort her from the airport.

Breaking strict protocol, the officers agreed to Allen's request to be put in handcuffs as she knelt down - and an aide took a photograph and posted it on her Twitter account which has more than 4.7 million followers. The image has since been removed.

In July, an AFP spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Allen was being escorted by the officers through the terminal when the photo was taken.

'At her request members involved placed open handcuffs for a photo opportunity,' the spokesman said.

'It appears the members involved were caught in the moment and standard protocol were breached.

'It is subject to internal processes.'

At the time, Gold Coast City councillor Dawn Crichlow said the stunt was no laughing matter.

'I don't appreciate a photo of ... police playing around with their handcuffs,' she told Fairfax radio.

'It's bad that the Federal Police allowed this to happen and they should be hauled over the coals.

'Just a bit of fun would have been to give her the police cap and have a photo taken like that, that would have been fun.'
