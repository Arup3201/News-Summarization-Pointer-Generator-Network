Connor Short, 16, died when he was a passenger in a car that crashed into another vehicle

A teenager has been killed in a car crash on a stretch of country road just yards from where his father was knocked down and killed eight years ago.

Connor Short, 16, suffered from horrific injuries and later died at hospital after the collision on Matlock Road in Ashover, near Chesterfield.

His mother, Sarah, said that she became worried when he failed to return from football training and went out looking for him.

She came across the scene of the accident between a Peugeot 206 and a Vauxhall Corsa.

The mother-of-two said: 'Connor had sent me a message to say he was on his way home but he never arrived and an hour later I knew something was wrong.

'I got into my car and I came across the crash. I saw an ambulance and police cars and I knew something dreadful had happened.

'Police took me to Chesterfield 
Hospital where they tried to stabilise Connor but they were losing the 
battle to save him and he died in the early hours of the following day.'

The tragedy is the second for the family in eight years after Connor's father, David, was killed on Christmas Eve in 2004.

He was walking home following a night out when he was hit by a VW Golf just after midnight.

Mrs Connor, who has another son, Joseph, 14, added: David died near the scene of Connor's crash. My son had to grow up quickly and was always very protective towards me. He was a kind and thoughtful boy.

Sarah Short said that since his father had died, Connor had become protective of her and his brother, Joseph

'He was so happy because he had just got a landscape gardening apprenticeship after leaving school.'

The driver of the car in which Connor was killed suffered fractures in the accident while another passenger is still in a critical condition at the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham.

The two men in the the Corsa were treated for minor injuries at Chesterfield Royal Hospital.

An inquest has been opened and adjourned into Connor’s death. The hearing was told he was in the back of the car. His funeral has not yet been arranged.

Floral tributes have been left on the side of the A632 near Ashover where the teenager was killed
