Judge Judy, known for her high profile deliberations on televised drama-filled court cases, has filed a lawsuit of her own as she claims a lawyer used her image without her consent.

The television judge, full name Judy Sheindlin, is filing a lawsuit against a Connecticut personal-injury lawyer, alleging that he had falsely produced advertisements saying she had endorsed his firm.

She is seeking more than $75,000 in damages from Hartford attorney John Haymond and his firm, which mainly represents people seeking compensation for injuries.

The lawsuit is the first that Judge Judy has ever filed, and she claims that it is because he is 'shamelessly' using her image to promote himself without permission

Judith Sheindlin - otherwise known by her TV handle Judge Judy, has starred in her show of the same name for 18 years, and this lawsuit marks the first time she has filed anything of this kind against anyone.

She said the unauthorised use of her name and image is 'outrageous' and requires action.

She said: 'Mr Haymond is a lawyer and should know better.

Judy Sheindlin says that if she wins, all of the proceeds will go to the 'Her Honor' scholarship scheme

The lawsuit says that without Sheindlin's permission, Haymond's firm aired television advertisements combining footage from 'Judge Judy' along with clips showing Haymond and his daughters, in an endorsement for the firm.

It also says the advertisements aired in Connecticut and Massachusetts during broadcasts of her show, and continued even after Sheindlin's producer told the firm in March 2013 that use of her image was not permitted.

The lawsuit says: 'By trading, without consent or authorization, on Sheindlin's well-known persona, the Haymond Defendants have irreparably harmed and damaged Sheindlin's hard-earned professional and artistic reputation, dignity, and prestige.'

Sheindlin said in her statement that any money she wins through the lawsuit will go toward college scholarships through the Her Honor Mentoring Program.

Mr Haymond's law firm advertises that it has 'over $500,000,000 recovered' as a consequence of cases won.

Their cases specialise in motorcycle accident claims, medical malpractice and car accidents.

Mr Haymond was unavailable for comment.
