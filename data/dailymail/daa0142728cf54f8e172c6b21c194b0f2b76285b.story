A mother may have to wait a year for the judge’s verdict on a contempt charge against her after bringing her newborn baby to jury duty while breastfeeding.

A Missouri judge told new mom Laura Trickle, of Lee’s Summit, yesterday that he would wait to see if legislators would offer a jury duty exemption for nursing mothers before making his verdict according to The Kansas City Star.

Jackson County Presiding Judge Marco Roldan also decided to refund a $500 fine given to another breastfeeding mother but said that if legislation did not change, he would re-impose the charge against Ms Trickle and the fine against the other mother.

In limbo: Laura Trickle was charged with contempt after bringing her newborn baby Axel to jury duty because she was breastfeeding. Now she might wait a year to find out the judge's verdict

Ms Trickle said: 'The judge stated he is going to follow the law, which is what he should do.

'It’s the law that needs changed.'

The judge will review the women’s cases on June 6 next year, taking into account legislative changes if any.

Ms Trickle delivered her son Axel Graham in March and was breastfeeding when she was called for jury duty in August.

She
asked to be exempt from appearing, as she was breastfeeding, but 
received notice that she must report to court to fullfill her civic 
obligation and serve jury duty, according to the Kansas City Star.

Trickle was told to either arrange for child care or bring somebody with her who could care for the child during jury selection.

On September 3, she appeared for jury duty with her child, but according to the ensuing court order, she ‘willfully and contemptuously appeared for jury service with her child and no one to care for the child’.

Those who skip jury duty can be found in contempt of court and ordered to pay a fine of up to $500 and maybe even be arrested.

Twelve states in America have jury duty exemptions for breastfeeding mothers.

The mother insists she is not a criminal, saying ‘I’ve never even had a speeding ticket’.

Breastfeeding women are exempted from jury duty in 12 states.

New
legislation introduced by a St. Joseph physician and state senator, Rob
Schaaf, would exempt breastfeeding mothers from jury duty across 
Missouri.

Such an exemption would help encourage more Missouri mothers to breastfeed, said state Sen. Rob Schaaf of St. Joseph.

‘Babies
who are breastfed generally are healthier, are less likely to have 
certain health problems and will cost the state less resources,’ said 
Schaaf to the Kansas City Star.

‘Jury duty is a roadblock to that.’

Missouri statutes allow for exemptions when a juror would face ‘an undue or extreme physical or financial hardship’.

Judge Roldan said earlier that he has on some occasions excused potential jurors who just had a death in the family, or teachers who were scheduled to give midterm exams.

While keeping some jurors, he often has sought to accommodate their needs, he said.

One juror who told Roldan he could not sit for extended periods received a seat in the back row of the jury box, where he was free to stand occasionally, even during testimony.

Some health advocates appreciate the accommodations the court makes.

‘Providing
a room for mothers to breastfeed or pump is good, and we very much 
encourage that,’ said Anne Biswell of the Mother & Child Health 
Coalition, which promotes wellness in the Kansas City area.

Court date: June 6 next year is the date set by the judge at Jackson County Courthouse (pictured) to review the case

Roldan, while declining to discuss Trickle’s specific case, said breastfeeding Jackson County mothers have the option of using occasional breaks during jury service to use a private room to pump milk and store it, feeding it to their children later.

They are also allowed to bring a caregiver to the courthouse to watch the child during trial proceedings and then take the child to a private room to breastfeed.

But Trickle said she has no child care options, and stays at home while Axel’s father works.

About 1,000 potential jurors report downtown every month, but the number of judges needing juries varies, and sometimes fewer jurors may be assigned to cases.

‘About 50 per cent are not even going to go upstairs to a case,’ Roldan told the Star.

Trickle is one of two breastfeeding Jackson County women who recently have faced possible penalties for not serving jury duty. It’s not that she isn’t willing, she said.

‘The issue is the timing,’ she said. ‘I just can’t do it right now.’
