A 'bungling' shop manager who faked an armed raid on his store with the help of his boyfriend was caught after police found a photograph of him wearing the robber's balaclava saved on his iPhone.

Christopher Usher, 30, was desperate for money  because his mother was throwing him out so he decided to steal the takings from the newsagents where he worked in Lincoln.

He and social worker John Skate, 40, acted out a violent robbery in which Skate attacked him minutes after he opened up the shop.

But police later checked Usher's phone and found a picture of the robber's outfit, including overalls and the mask.

Usher and Skate, both of 
Lincoln, each admitted charges of theft and perverting the course of 
justice. Usher was jailed for 34 months and Skate for 26 
months.

Lincoln Crown Court heard everything initially went to plan with Skate, wearing a balaclava and overalls, bursting on the scene armed with a broom handle to give the impression he had a gun.

Items were rearranged in the shop to make it look as if a real robbery had taken place and a light fitting was smashed to give added effect.

Usher was locked in a store room before Skate fled from the scene with £8,000 cash and £150 worth of cigarettes.

The bogus robbery sparked a serious crime inquiry but he was caught out when officers checked his phone and discovered a photograph of the same set of clothes he had described the robber as wearing.

The pair went on to confess that they specially bought the clothes for Skate to wear during the fake hold-up.

Now Usher is behind bars along with his partner Skate, who switched careers late in life and obtained a degree from Lincoln University as a mature student before finding employment with  North East Lincolnshire Council working with vulnerable adults.

The alarm was raised when an early morning customer called at the McColl's Newsagents at the Brant Road Shopping Centre, Lincoln, and found the door locked.

She alerted staff at a nearby store and police were called. Officers were at the scene within minutes.

Stuart Lody, prosecuting, said: 'They found Usher cowering in a storeroom which had been secured from the outside preventing him from leaving.

'He appeared to be in great fear. It was taken extremely seriously by the police.'

Usher told officers he had been attacked by a man with an East European accent and went on to make a 12 page witness statement in which he described the balaclava and overalls worn by the raider.

Mr Lody told the court: 'He described in close detail the man's clothing and the fact that he had a shotgun with him.'

Police sealed off the shopping centre and set up a major incident investigation with officers poring over CCTV footage from the area in a bid to identify the robber.

But during the inquiry Usher told officers he had left his mobile at home that morning.

Mr Lody added: 'Usher referred to the fact that he owned a Blackberry which was at his house. The police went to check that and were somewhat surprised that Mr Usher's mother told them he also had an iPhone as well.

'On the i-phone was a photograph of the set of overalls and the balaclava he had described as being worn by the robber.'

Defence: Christopher Usher acted out of desperation because of his financial situation and John Skate says he was pestered into it by his partner

The focus of the police investigation switched to Usher and Skate who both went on to confess that they had staged the robbery.

All but a few hundred pounds of the money was subsequently recovered from where it had been buried by Skate in a relative's garden.

Mr Lody said: 'The two men were partners. Usher had taken out a joint mortgage with his mother on a property. That mortgage fell into arrears. That would seem to be the catalyst which caused him to hatch a plot to stage a fictitious robbery on the shop where he worked.

'The plan was that Skate would dress up as a robber. He would go to the store and a fake armed robbery would be carried out.'

Judge Sean Morris told them 'These sentences are to deter others from committing this kind of offending which is a very easy thing to do.'

Joanna Staples, for Usher, said 'It was an act of desperation by Mr Usher. Not only was he to be made homeless but his mother also. He was in a state of despair. He saw no other way out of his problems other than this severely misconceived notion of taking this money from his place of work.'

Sunil Khanna, for Skate, said 'He initially said no but he was pestered into getting involved. He was blinded by affection for his partner. He simply cannot understand how he got himself involved in this.'

Angela Clark, District Crown Prosecutor for CPS East Midlands said “The deception perpetrated by these two defendants caused widespread concern and fear within their community when it was suspected that an armed robbery had taken place.

'They thought they had committed the perfect crime. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Their deception was quickly uncovered and the evidence against them so overwhelming, they had no option but to plead guilty both for the theft and for perverting the course of justice in attempting to hide their crime.'
