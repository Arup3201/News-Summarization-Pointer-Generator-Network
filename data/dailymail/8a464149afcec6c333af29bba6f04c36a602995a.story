Hurt: Kiera Morgan (pictured with husband Charles Morgan) posted angry messages on Twitter

The glamorous actress wife at the centre of the Morgan sports-car family feud has launched an angry tirade against the  ‘greed and ego’ of her husband’s relatives and former boardroom  colleagues.

She said the legendary English car-maker in rural Malvern, Worcestershire had ‘sold its soul’ and that their treatment of her husband – including the removal of his beloved Morgan  company car -  had left their seven year-old daughter ‘crying.’

The outpouring came as Charles Morgan himself spoke emotionally on Friday of how his ousting from the company that has borne his family’s name for three generations was ‘extremely personally distressing’ on the tenth anniversary of his father Peter’s death.

Meanwhile, his wife Kiera posted angry messages on Twitter about the family feud at the heart of the split, saying ‘greed and ego got the better of them.’

She tweeted of her husband’s ousting: ’It’s cruel &indecent. It's changed my view on families. Without Charles it's merely another lost business that sold its soul’.

’In this case the greed and the ego got better of them. It's as simple as that. There is no other justification to their actions.

On the loss of the family Morgan, she added that  her seven year-old daughter was ‘crying’ and ‘scared’ about how she would get to school because ‘they are taking away daddy’s car’.

She added: ’Today is the 10 year anniversary of Peter Morgan's death. I hope he can see the tears of his grandchildren and the unnecessary pain.’

Father of five Mr  Morgan, 62, a former ITN cameraman, married his current wife Kiera  – named in ‘Who’s Who’ as Kira Kopylova with whom he has a son and a daughter – in 2003. He has  one son and two daughters from a previous marriage.

The Morgan firm was founded more than a century ago in 1910 by Mr Morgan’s grandfather Henry Morgan, his father Peter, and himself.

Distressing: Charles Morgan said: 'Being asked to leave the company that bears my name is also extremely personally distressing.'

Seven months ago Mr Morgan stepped down as managing director but retained  the post of ‘ambassador’ for the firm – until Morgan and its new MD Steve Morris announced this week he would no longer have a role in the running of the company.

Mr Morgan said: ‘I have been asked to leave the Morgan Motor Company by the board. It is a sad decision that I am appealing. I remain a major shareholder in Morgan.’

He insisted: ‘I’d like to be clear that I am not a tycoon but a family man – I inherited a company not wealth –  and unexpectedly leaving its employment will be a hardship for myself and my family.

‘Being asked to leave the company that bears my name is also extremely personally distressing. That is made more painful as today marks 10 years since my father, Peter Morgan, died and I feel him in spirit with me in this dispute.’

He insisted: ’My primary concern is completely for the company I have spent 30 years helping to build, and specifically for Morgan’s employees, who I hold in the highest regard. I want nothing but success for Morgan Motor Company in the future and remain committed to this goal.’

Charles Morgan and his wife Kiera Morgan pictured driving a Morgan sport car during the opening of China's first Morgan sport cars showroom in Shanghai. On the loss of the family Morgan, Mrs Morgan said her seven year-old daughter was 'crying' and 'scared' about how she would get to school because 'they are taking away daddy's car'

He expressed his gratitude ‘for the expressions of support received on twitter and elsewhere, particularly from the employees of Morgan.’

He said he was proud that  company’s annual production volumes are ‘double what they were at the start of my tenure’ adding: ‘Morgan remains a small but successful family firm.’

He added he would be ‘making no further statements for the time being’.

However, Mr Morgan had hinted to a conference of business leaders on Thursday that a bitter family feud lies behind his dramatic exit in a boardroom coup.

He regaled his audience of business chiefs with tales of his jet-set life with his glamorous young Eastern European actress wife Kiera, his driving adventures with her across America in the Gumball3000 rally, and his business deals in China to boost exports.

Describing the car-firm’s founding he said: ’One hundred and four years later I represent the third generation of Morgan family’ marking a line that goes back almost as far as the dawn of the  motor industry.

But he said: ’I no longer have an executive role.’

Statement: Charles Morgan posted his account on Twitter

He then set out how the family-run firm is divided among its members: ‘I have a 30 per cent shareholding. I’m also  one of the beneficiaries of a trust whose two trustees share 48 per cent of the company.

‘At this stage this is all I am prepared to discuss’.

He also set out his own vision for Morgan, hinting again that these may have been areas of tension within the company.

At the end of his speech, Mr Morgan was spirited out the back of the building – the Central Hall in London’s Westminster - where he was photographed getting on his bike having been told in so many words by his board:  ‘on your bike.’

Mr Morgan says he is appealing against the decision by Morgan Motor Company, which said he would no longer be a part of the managing team or the board of directors at Morgan Technologies, a subsidiary.

Some of the 400 workforce at the Malvern factory took to Twitter to express their support. One tweeted: ‘We can't believe the company is not being run by a Morgan family member

‘It's probably not best to name individuals on this account but the general feel around the factory is we would like Charles Morgan back’.

Another supporter tweeted: ‘Can't see how the current management team can be better placed than Charles Morgan  to lead the organisation.’

Charles Morgan replied: ‘Thanks from the depth of my heart. You are the lifeblood of the company and must be treated with the respect that you deserve.’

‘Every one of you make Morgan a great company and great cars, never forget that.’

The Morgan company said in a statement: ‘Further to decisions taken in January of this year, Morgan Technologies is now in a position to announce that Charles Morgan is no longer part of the management team or board of directors of the company.’

Setting out reasons for his enforced departure, the firm said: ‘The Morgan family recognises the management contribution that Charles has made to the family business as strategy director, and confirm that he remains a shareholder.

‘However, to ensure continuing success, Morgan must look to strengthen and review its strategies, and acknowledge that our management team are better placed to steer the company in the future.’

Mr Morgan joined the firm in 1985, working next to his father Peter who retired in 1999.

Morgan is on course to sell a record-breaking 1,200 cars this year.
