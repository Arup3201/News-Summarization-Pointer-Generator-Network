Just days after a relatively unknown TV sports personality gained overnight fame thanks to her provocative primping, Rebecca Grant has had a mini-meltdown on national television.

The sexy TV host was a guest on FOX411 in Los Angeles to discuss her instant recognition from last weekends' LA Clippers game.

Out of the blue the former FHM model began shouting at her friend off-camera and broke off from the live television interview.

'Stop it! I’m sorry. This isn’t live,' she shouted. As she continued to look at her friend she rambled incoherently. 'What? I already said that. Stop it. Go away.'

Meltdown: Rebecca Grant, the former FHM model, yelled at her friend off-camera during a live national television interview

Liability? Every time she gets in front of a camera, Grant seems to make headlines

Whlie she was on camera, Ms. Grant spoke about how her current fifteen minutes of fame could help her career going forward.

'I’m hoping that this entire experience makes me verified by Twitter because I’ve been a sports fanatic for a long time,' she told FOX.

'I support a lot of teams. I have lots of professional players following me. They love my tweets.'

Ms Grant currently has more than 84,000 Twitter followers and counting. She reminded her fans that they can expect to see her at the next Clippers game on Friday.

'I have almost the exact same seats,' she said. 'In fact; I think I should be an employee. I’m the biggest clippers fan in all of Los Angeles.'

Nonsense: Grant went off on a rambling rant where she talked about how important the number of Twitter followers was to her ego

Just making some adjustments: Her name is Rebecca Grant and her list of 
credits includes stints as a host on off-roading, football and hockey 
shows as well as some small acting roles--but her performance at the 
Staples center has sent her fame quotient through the roof

Friday's game will presumably involve more primping in front of TV cameras at the game.

Last Sunday she was caught grabbing her breasts. She reposted the video on her Twitter feed while 
denying any knowledge there was a live camera situated just two rows in front
 of her.

'LMFAO,' the hostess tweeted. 'This is honestly the funniest thing I have ever seen! Every single person is animated. Had no idea I was on.'

Whether or not Grant knew what she was doing as she hiked up her breasts and volumized her hair, her new fans were well aware of the effect she was having and returned the favor by turning her name and pouting face into viral social media gold.

Her low-cut top and the cameraman's fixed stare helped out, as well.

Meanwhile, Grant has quickly moved to capitalize on her sudden fame by retweeting some of the more flattering screen grabs and compliments on Twitter from her new fans.

The brief clip from the game against the Golden State Warriors was enough to turn Grant's pouting face and hair volumizing into viral gold

Grant has had a varied career. She lists hosting duties for ESPN 2, TLC, E! and the NFL Network.

She’s also had bit parts in both TV and movies playing characters like Dream girl in 'Providence,' Escort in 'Sticks' and Yolanda the Pole Dancer in 'Don’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23.'

On Twitter she describes herself as 'sexy NFL hostess on Fox sports' and says she’s also been featured in FHM and Maxim magazines. But Saturday gave Grant her greatest exposure to date.
