Controversial: Deidre Clark used the pen name Deidre Dare to write her erotic novel

A female lawyer who posted an erotic novel on the internet has won the go-ahead to sue a top City law firm for almost £22 million for alleged sexual harassment.

Deidre Clark, 46, is demanding the huge damages after she was fired by Allen & Overy from her £126,000-a-year job at its Moscow office.

Miss Clark, whose pen name is Deidre Dare, claims she suffered 'sexual persecution' by her 60-year-old married boss at the firm between July 2008 and her sacking in January 2009.

East London employment tribunal last year refused to hear her £3.5 million claim for sex discrimination and unfair dismissal last year, saying it was outside its jurisdiction.

But now US judge Marcy Friedman has ruled that Miss Clark should be allowed to take legal action in New York, where she currently lives.

Her $35 million claim accuses Allen & Overy of sexual harassment, discrimination, wrongful termination of her employment, retaliation, breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent retention and supervision of the lawyer who allegedly harassed her, defamation, and conspiracy.

Allen & Overy once again tried to have Miss Clark’s case kicked out for lack of jurisdiction - but Judge Friedman ruled in her favour on seven out of eight counts.

Miss Clark, who represented herself in court, said afterwards: 'I won against Allen & Overy! Isn’t it amazing?

'You can’t imagine how great it feels - pure joy, really. And it’s not just a win. I devastated them.'

Since leaving the firm, Miss Clark has written a newspaper column telling of her love of sado-masochist sex and bondage - and claimed it is 'natural' for men to rape and beat women.

According to the preliminary ruling at New York’s Supreme Court, Miss Clark alleges that on July 19, 2008 she 'engaged in sexual activity with Tony Humphrey, the partner supervising her work in Moscow, while she was intoxicated at a party in the home of a colleague'.

He allegedly then 'made inappropriate comments, sought to engage Miss Clark in sexual conversations and ceased to give her work assignments'.

In legal papers put before both the English and American courts, Miss Clark alleges that her sacking was purely down to him.

She claims that he became 'sexually obsessed' with her after their steamy clinch - that did not involve actual sex - in full view of colleagues at the party.

She says he was then left 'infuriated' when he spotting her with a new, Russian boyfriend.

She claims: 'When I rebuffed his further advances and took up with a much younger and Russian man, it infuriated him and made him crazy with jealousy and that that is why I was dismissed.

'I believe my dismissal was purely a matter of sexual persecution by my superior.'

Miss Clark’s novel ‘Expat’, written as Deidre Dare, was seen as exposing the debauched sex and drugs lifestyle of highly-paid Westerners in Moscow.

The heroine, Dasha, states: 'I drink too much. I do too many drugs. I f**k around. I waste days and time. I spend too much time at parties. There’s a shorter way of saying all that: "I live in Moscow".'

Miss Clark was sacked by Allen & Overy in January 2009 and told it was because of the novel, racy poetry and revealing pictures of herself that she was posting on her website.

But she claims that reason was just a pretext for her sacking; denies that the novel was about colleagues; and insists she had the right to publish a fictional story.

Allen & Overy said when Miss Clark was fired that her novel was 'unacceptable and totally at odds with the standards of behaviour that we expect'.

But she alleges: 'One of my potential clients said he often sees A&O people at whorehouses and throwing up in bars.

'He couldn’t understand how my little book could possibly bring the firm into disrepute.'

In her subsequent newspaper column for the Moscow News called ‘sExpat’ she wrote: 'Men have been dragging women by the hair since caveman days. It’s in their nature to be violent.

'The human male has evolved to slap his slutty woman... if you’re hanging out with real men and you’re a little slutty, you’re going to get hit. Period.'

Miss Clark described rape as 'simply part of human nature', adding: 'At any rate, it works out perfectly for me. When it goes to raping and pillaging, I say: Bring it on, baby!!!'

In one article entitled ‘Come on, cavemen!’, Miss Clark said she 'gets off on being bound and whipped inside the bedroom'.

She wrote: 'Anyone who has spent even five minutes in bed with me knows that I have a strong proclivity for S&M.'

She went on to say that she has been slapped and thrown into walls by jealous Russian boyfriends and mocks Western women for ditching boyfriends and seeking restraining orders over domestic violence.

She said: 'Russian men are MEN. Real men. And I rather like that.'

Allen & Overy said: 'We have always been entirely satisfied that the termination of Ms Clark’s employment was justified and lawful.

'We remain committed to defending Ms Clark’s claim vigorously.'
