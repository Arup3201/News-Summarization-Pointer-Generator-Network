A Texas mother is facing possible charges after a pet raccoon attacked her two-week-old infant.

Officers were called to a mobile home in Kountze where they found Brittany Darby, 19, holding her baby boy, who was bleeding profusely from lacerations across his left eye and the top of his head.

The newborn was flown to Texas Children's Hospital in Houston where he was treated for two days before he was released into the care of his mother.

Precaution: The baby's mother is facing charges from police for endangering her baby, and also Texas Parks and Wildlife for keeping the raccoons without a permit

The animal and another raccoon kept as pets in the home were euthanized on the scene as a safety precaution.

According to KBMT, the animals were being kept without a proper license or permit.

Police say a preliminary investigation indicates the baby was left inside the home with the two raccoons.

Darby's
 boyfriend entered the home after hearing the baby screaming and found 
one of the raccoons 'slapping the baby in the face,' reports KBMT.

Combative: Members of the Darby family became aggressive when reporters questioned them about the incident outside their home

Wild: Mature raccoons can act aggressively, especially during the mating season, and experts do not recommend the animals are kept as pets

Darby's family became combative when local reporters attempted to speak to them about the incident

'Go talk to the game warden. Ask him why dogs are running around, but domesticated animals no more harmful than a baby itself was killed,' said one family member.

Both raccoons tested negative for rabies.

Matt Fortenberry of Beaumont Animal Services told KBMT that if people choose to have raccoons as pets, they risk attack from the creatures.

'You can not take the wild animal out of it,' he said. 'Once it reaches maturity sometimes they will turn and can harm a person.'

Darby faces charges of abandoning or endangering a child.

She may also face charges from Texas Parks and Wildlife for housing the raccoons without a license.
