Paul Ciancia, 23, moved to LA in 2012 from his native New Jersey

Federal agents are investigating the possibility that the alleged Los Angeles airport gunman believed in a conspiracy theory about a global takeover by the government.

The FBI were given a warrant on Monday to search Paul Ciancia's cell phone for materials reflecting his 'views on the legitimacy or activities of the United States government, including the existence of a plot to impose a New World Order,' according to court documents.

Ciancia, a 23-year-old unemployed motorcycle mechanic, got a ride to LAX on Friday morning, walked inside and began targeting Transportation Security Administration officers, authorities said.

By the time LAX police officers subdued him with several gunshots, one TSA officer, Gerardo I. Hernandez, had been killed and two others were injured.

A note found in a bag after the shooting mentioned the 'NWO,' an apparent reference to the new world order belief that holds an international cabal of elites is planning to take away the guns and personal freedoms of Americans, authorities said.

Perceived masterminds behind the conspiracy have shifted over several generations, among them bankers, communists and the government itself. Why airport security officers apparently came to personify oppression for the gunman remains unclear.

A motive? They are investigating his ties to the belief in the New World Order - that a totalitarian regime will take away weapons and freedoms. Pictured, Los Angeles airport after the shooting

The TSA does not regularly feature as a target of the theory's ire, according to Mark Potok, who has studied extremist groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center.

More typically, believers focus on another homeland security agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which according to the theory plans to build camps to detain resisters to the new order, Potok said.

Potok said he has seen no evidence that Ciancia was personally involved in hate groups.

The rant in his note also spoke of how
 TSA searches were a violation of constitutional rights and a vulgar 
term was used to refer to Janet Napolitano, the former secretary of the 
Department of Homeland Security, which oversees TSA.

Ciancia's family, from Pennsville, New Jersey, have offered sympathy to the family of the victim. In a statement, they also expressed their shock at the rampage and hope for the recovery of the surviving victims.

One of those officers, Tony Grigsby, spoke for the first time publicly, saying he was trying to help an elderly man get to safety when the gunman shot him in the right foot.

He hobbled with a cane outside his South Los Angeles home, where he fought back tears recalling Hernandez as a wonderful person who will be missed.

'Only now it has hit me that I will never see him again,' Grigsby said.

Co-workers, friends and others gathered Monday night for a tribute to Hernandez at a beach near the airport.

'He was loved,' Jose Araujo, one of hundreds of people who gathered at Dockweiler State Beach, told KNBC-TV. 'He's going to be missed and he's never going to be forgotten.'

The other wounded TSA officer has been released from the hospital, the agency said, and the condition of high school teacher Brian Ludmer, who was shot in the calf, was upgraded from fair to good.

Ciancia remained in critical condition and any court appearance on charges of first-degree murder of a federal officer and committing violence at an international airport will depend on when his doctors say he's ready, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.
