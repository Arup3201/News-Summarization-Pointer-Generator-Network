One in every seven companies in the UK has been set up by migrant entrepreneurs, a new report revealed today.

Nearly half a million people from 155 countries have settled in the UK and launched businesses.

The Centre for Entrepreneurs think tank said the contribution of foreign-owned companies to Britain was ‘breath-taking’.

Overall, 14 per cent of jobs are created by companies founded by migrants to the UK.

Researchers said the report, by Centre for Entrepreneurs and financial technology company DueDil, cast light on the positive impact migrants made on the UK's economy.

DueDil founder Damian Kimmelman, himself an American serial ‘migrant entrepreneur’, said: ‘Immigration is one of Britain's most emotive topics for debate. Sadly, opinions are rarely informed by evidence.

‘This game-changing research proves that migrant entrepreneurs are hyper-productive, net contributors to the UK economy.

‘History tells us that the most productive states always encourage intellectual and technological ferment; that's what we're seeing in Britain right now, and we must celebrate it.’

While just 10.4 per cent of people born 
in the UK start a business here, 17.2 per cent of migrants in Britain 
have started their own company.

They are also younger, the report found, with migrant entrepreneurs 44.3 years-old on average compared to 52.1 for those born in the UK.

Centre for Entrepreneurs chairman and serial entrepreneur Luke Johnson

said: ‘The majority of the public appreciate the value of migrant entrepreneurs, yet our politicians and media send out negative signals that risk alienating this vital group of job creators.

‘Given the huge contribution of migrant entrepreneurs, we are calling upon the media and politicians to join us in celebrating those who come to our country and launch businesses.’

The report found the UK's migrant entrepreneurs are from almost every country, although there are significant representations from Ireland, India, the US, Germany and China, as well as African countries.

There are almost 190,000 migrant entrepreneurs in London, 19,000 in Birmingham and 17,000 in Belfast

London benefits disproportionately, with 20 times the number of migrant-led businesses (188,000) than Birmingham, the second most popular location with 19,000.

YouGov polling undertaken for the report 
reveals that a significant proportion of the general public believe 
migrant entrepreneurs make a positive contribution to the UK (44 per 
cent) and a majority support the government's efforts to attract new 
migrant entrepreneurs (50 per cent) compared with 28 per cent who 
disagree.

Centre for Entrepreneurs chairman Luke Johnson said migrant entrepreneurs make a 'huge contribution'

This is despite the fact the public view immigration in a generally negative light and support a reduction in net immigration (68 per cent).

Matt Smith, director of the Centre for Entrepreneurs, said: ‘The contribution of migrant entrepreneurs is, to be frank, breath-taking.

‘It is now the responsibility of politicians of all parties to celebrate migrant entrepreneurs' contributions and restate their commitment to maintaining pro-entrepreneurship immigration policies.’

The report comes a fortnight after Britain's most senior Roman Catholic cleric called on political leaders to ‘extinguish the discourse of fear’ that undermined the contribution of foreign entrepreneurs and workers moving to the UK.

Speaking ahead of being created a cardinal last month, the Most Rev Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, said migrant workers helped ensure large cities such as London were able to ''carry on working’.

He said: ‘I think we really should have a positive appreciation of the contribution that people who come to this country make to our well-being and economy. I think the idea that immigrants are a net drain on our economy is false.

‘We should not have a discourse about immigration which is based on fear.’
