President Barack Obama will embark on a previously planned two-week vacation to Martha's Vineyard tomorrow regardless of the violence in Iraq and Gaza.

Even as the first military airstrikes he authorized in northern Iraq were carried out Friday, Obama did not cancel the trip.

The White House said Thursday Obama would come back
 to Washington midway through the getaway to attend meetings but he will
 rejoin his family at the vacation spot later that week.

The White House says the president plans to return to Martha's Vineyard tomorrow regardless of the situation in Iraq

He is scheduled to arrive on the wealthy island off the Massachusetts coast on Saturday and return to Washington a week later, on Sunday, Aug. 17.

After the meetings, plans call for Obama to return to the Vineyard on Aug. 19 to resume the vacation, which ends five days later on Aug. 24.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama would meet with staff, but he declined to say who else would participate or what the meetings are about.

'This is an opportunity for the president to do some in-person meetings here at the White House, just for a day or two, before he returns to Martha's Vineyard,' Earnest said Thursday.

Earnest sought to contain mounting speculation about the vacation, saying the meetings aren't related to 'an emerging situation.' 

Later that day President Obama announced in a presidential address that the U.S. had made air drops of food and water to some 40,000 Iraqi refugees trapped on a mountain. And on Friday morning the U.S. launched an air strike against Islamic extremists threatening to eradicate them.

'When we face a situation like we do on that mountain - with innocent people facing the prospect of violence on a horrific scale . . . and when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America cannot turn a blind eye,' Obama said Thursday night.

'We can act, carefully and responsibly, to prevent a potential act of genocide,'he said. 'That’s what we’re doing on that mountain.'

President Obama appeared to be full steam ahead with his vacation on Friday.

Earnest told reporters this afternoon he did not have an update on the president's meeting schedule, however, he said he wouldn't be surprised if some were about Iraq.

'But again the president had planned to return to the White House before this announcement,' he said, referring to this morning's air strikes.

Outside of Iraq there are several 
other issues brewing that could require Obama's urgent attention, 
including fighting between Israel and Hamas militants and Russia's 
buildup of troops along its border with Ukraine.

A temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended this morning after Israel refused to adhere to the terror backed group's demand that it end its seven-year blockade of Gaza.

Toward the close of the 72-hour window Hamas fired at least 10 rockets, ending the longest ceasefire since the fighting began a month ago. Israel retaliated with strikes of its own, hitting several 'terror sites' in Gaza.

Meanwhile, Russia placed a one-year, 'full embargo' on the bulk of food imports from the West on Thursday, including beef, pork, fruit, produce, poultry, fish, cheese and milk, in response to enhanced sanctions on its country by the U.S. and its allies over Russian-backed separatists' occupation of eastern Ukraine.

Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has also threatened to ban Europe and U.S. airliners from making transit flights to the Asia-Pacific region through Russia.

Even so, Obama has not cancelled his vacation. Obama rarely forgoes getaways or fundraising trips based on global or domestic crises.

His
 advisers often appear to take pride in resisting calls from Republicans
 for the president to return to Washington or from fellow Democrats 
nervous about the appearance of Obama either vacationing or tending to 
what some may consider less urgent matters.

'He
 travels with an array of communications equipment and national security
 advisers that will allow him to perform all of the functions that are 
required of America's commander in chief,' Earnest said.

'That's true of any trip that he takes, and it will be true of the trip that the president takes this week.'

In 2009, Obama remained on vacation in his native of Hawaii after a man aboard a Detroit-bound flight tried to detonate a bomb on Christmas.

Obama also continued on with Martha's Vineyard vacations in 2010 as rebels in Libya were on the verge of ousting their government, and last year when Egypt's military overthrew the country's first democratically elected leader.

Just last month, Obama resisted calls while on a fundraising trip in Texas to visit the U.S.-Mexico border to witness the surge of unaccompanied children arriving there.

Pressed about the appearance of ignoring a humanitarian crisis, Earnest declared at the time: 'We're not worried about those optics.'

Obama has upended his travel plans on several occasions, however.

He has canceled three trips to Asia, including one in 2013 because of the U.S. government shutdown.

His late-December departures to spend Christmas in Hawaii frequently have been delayed because of late action on Capitol Hill. In 2012, he returned to Washington from a Hawaiian vacation to deal with 'fiscal cliff' negotiations.

Obama's public appearances while on vacation typically are limited to stops at local merchants and dinner out with family and friends. But in another unusual twist this summer, the president plans to attend a Democratic fundraiser on Martha's Vineyard on Monday.

The Obamas stay in Chilmark, on the western part of the island, and have rented a seven-bedroom, nine-bath, 8,100-square-foot house along the island's Vineyard Sound side, far off any main roads.

The Martha's Vineyard Times reported earlier this month that the 17 room home sits on 10 acres of land and is worth upward of $12 million. The property also features a pool, hot tub,and a dual tennis-basketball court.

Obama has vacationed on the quaint island every summer of his presidency except during the 2012 re-election campaign
