Mario Balotelli fired a warning shot to Everton, quite literally, ahead of the Merseyside derby this weekend, with a stunning free-kick in Liverpool training on Thursday.

The eccentric Italian will compete in his first derby for the Reds on Saturday lunchtime, and the Anfield faithful will be hoping to see plenty more of this come kick-off.

Balotelli, sporting a brand new haircut during the training session, is expected to lead the line for Liverpool on Saturday, and is still searching for his first Premier League goal at his new side.

He opened his Reds account with a goal against Ludogorets in the Champions League, but is yet to score in three Premier League appearances.

In the video, Balotelli, faced with a four-man dummy wall and Simon Mignolet, bends the ball into the top right-hand corner, just out of reach of a full-stretch goalkeeper.

Everton suffered a surprise loss to Crystal Palace on Saturday, and are currently lagging in 14th place. Liverpool, though, have lost three of their first five games and also go into the match in the bottom half of the Premier League table.
