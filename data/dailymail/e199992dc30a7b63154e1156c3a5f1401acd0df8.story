She credited him with making her life worth living again after a long battle with cancer.

Now Jenni Murray is facing fresh anguish – after discovering her pet chihuahua Butch may also be suffering from the disease.

Sharing the ‘terribly worrying’ news with her fans last night, the Radio 4 Woman’s Hour presenter said she is waiting for test results on a suspicious lump on the dog’s side.

She wrote on her blog: ‘Butch on Monday was very quiet and subdued. He slept and slept, woke at five on Monday morning, crying to go out.

‘He was sick, sneezing and just wanted to lie in my arms and I noticed a tiny lump under the haunch on the left hand side.’

Dame Jenni, 64, said she took him to the vet, where he stayed overnight. He ‘perked up’ the following morning and managed to eat a little.

But she added: ‘Whilst his bug seemed to be passing, there was worrying news about the lump. A biopsy’s been done.

‘It could be something minor, but it could be something else.

‘I keep telling myself I had cancer eight years ago and I’m still here, but he’s only six. Please cross all fingers and toes, pray, if you do, and hope that the news, when the results come back, is good.’

When Dame Jenni bought Butch in 2007, she had already undergone months of chemotherapy and had had a mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer.

Her sons Charlie and Edward – who is a vet but was ‘hundreds of miles away’ when Butch fell ill – had left home and she wanted a companion.

But within weeks, she was suffering crippling pain in her legs – a side effect of the chemotherapy. She had to have a double hip replacement, and was unable to walk for months.

Dame Jenni later wrote a book about the experience called My Boy Butch, in which she credits the dog with helping her recover. She said at the time: ‘Butch was there as a constant reminder that there’s life after suffering. And he encouraged me to take steps I’d otherwise have feared, leaving me with no excuse just to wallow on the sofa.

‘True, he’s only a few inches high, but he also does his utmost to protect me. He may be a mere chihuahua, but he has the heart and stomach of the fiercest rottweiler.

‘The smallest of dogs, with the biggest of hearts, he came into my life at its lowest ebb. And, quite simply, [he] made it worth living again.’

Dame Jenni – who has presented Woman’s Hour since 1987 and was awarded an OBE for services to broadcasting in 1999 – has two other dogs, Frida and Madge.
