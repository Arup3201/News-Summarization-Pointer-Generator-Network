Ms Dixon was rushed to hospital but died two days later.

'I do think more people should learn first aid though. If more people have this knowledge, it may stop incidents like this from happening in the future.'

Meanwhile Ms Dixon's friends lead tributes to the former pub landlady.

Jackie Cook, who had known Sharon for more than 20 years, said: “She would do anything for anybody. She was very strong willed and always there for anybody that needed help.

'All her life she was happy and full of life, she was up for anything. Everybody knew her and she knew everybody.

'We all called her Big Shaz. We all loved her, we are all one big family down here and she was a major part of that family.

'She used to be landlady for many pubs and even then she would do the rounds and go in every pub to see everyone.

'She
would start at one end of Freeman Street and would go in every pub. I 
knew her for more than 20 years, I worked with her and I lived with her 
at one point.'

A close friend, who didn’t wish to be 
named said: “Sharon was a lovely woman. Nobody would have a bad word to 
say about her. We were very close.

'Everybody will have a story to tell about her. She was full of life.'
