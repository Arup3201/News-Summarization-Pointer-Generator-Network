If you feel that your dinner choices are getting boring then you may want to check out the newest range of unique meat and fish currently in supermarkets. 

Products from exotic animals like are proving to be more than able to stand up as viable alternative to traditional meats, poultry and seafood.

And Iceland is the latest high street store to offer a range of exotic creatures with ostrich, kangaroo, crocodile, wild boar and venison all appearing in their freezers.

The frozen food store has launched speciality meat products which include kangaroo burgers and meatballs, wild boar sausages and burgers, ostrich fillets, buffalo burgers and crocodile burgers.

Speaking about the new meat and fish ranges, Nigel Broadhurst, Joint Managing Director at Iceland, said: 'Our new meat and fish ranges are fantastic alternatives to traditional meat and fish options.'

He continued: 'The speciality meats are typically lower in fat and higher in protein, while most of the fish in our new range is naturally high in protein and rich in nutrients. 

'Both of the new ranges are ideal for those looking to introduce quick, versatile and tasty meals into their diet.'

This isn't the first time wild meats have appeared in high street stores. 

Last June, Tesco put free range ostrich meat on sale in 400 locations amid evidence the nation is developing a taste for exotic and unusual meat.

And in December last year, Lidl was offering reindeer steaks and ostrich meat, and claimed it was unable to keep up with demand. 

Even  the discount chain Budgens has previously put squirrel on its shelves while Aldi offered ostrich kebabs in September 2014.

The ostrich kebabs at Tesco are supplied by wholesaler DB Foods, which said a trial of Mossel Bay ostrich steaks at Britain's biggest supermarket in March 2014 had gone 'very well'.

There are some ostrich farmers in the UK, however the meat being sold by Tesco comes from South Africa as the result of an exclusive deal with a farmer co-operative called Mosstrich.

It is possible to buy Llama mince, imported from Chile, on Amazon plus many other exotic choices, ranging from zebra steaks and crocodile to kangaroo, camel and elk, from specialist suppliers.

DB Foods is already supplying more than 2,000 High Street butchers and Whole Foods Market with the kebabs. 

Chief executive Ben Bayer said that ostrich was set to become increasingly visible to consumers.

He said: 'It is our ambition to see ostrich become a mainstream meat. It's nutritional, has a great taste and is a healthy red meat.'

Ostrich is a particularly healthy red meat, coming in at just three per cent fat, compared to around 10.5 per cent for beef, and 15.2 per cent pork. It even has less fat than chicken, which is typically 7.4 per cent.
