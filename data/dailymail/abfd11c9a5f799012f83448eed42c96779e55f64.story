A billionaire who once dated Princess Diana has left his former girlfriend’s daughter a trust fund even though he is not the father of the child.

Theodore ‘Teddy’ Forstmann changed his will to give the undisclosed sum to two-year-old Krishna Lakshmi before he died last November at the age of 71.

The financier had dated her mother Padma Lakshmi, ex-wife of Salman Rushdie and host of popular U.S TV show Top Chef, for several years including during the birth.

It later turned out the father was another man but Forstmann raised the baby as if he were his own.

In Forstmann’s will filed at Manhattan Surrogate’s Court, he refers to her as his ‘friend’ and says that he forgives all loans he had given her.

But the details of Krishna’s trust fund and the money he gave her mother have not been made public after a request from his lawyers.

At the time of his death Forstmann was worth $1.8billion (£1.1billion) making him the 782nd richest man in the world.

The trust fund could run into the millions and could be used to pay for education or to just make Krishna financially secure for the rest of her life.

It had been reported that despite not being her father Forstman had been ‘carrying out the role of father since the moment Krishna was delivered into his arms.’

This led to speculation he was the dad but it later turned out the real father was Adam Dell, a U.S. venture capitalist and brother of Dell computer founder Michael Dell.

Dell had dated Lakshmi for two years but when they broke up she told him that she was pregnant and that Forstmann was the father.

Lakshmi encouraged her daughter to call him ‘Papa’ and gave the infant the middle name Thea that seems to be a nod to his full name.

She also publicly declared her love for Forstmann by saying: ‘I am lucky to have someone who unwaveringly gave me love and manly support — and is also the person that I love. So thank you, Teddy.’

Dell however claimed a paternity test proved it was his baby and sued for full custody.

He also demanded his name was put on the birth certificate, as it had been left off.

The New York Daily News reported that the lawsuit has now been resolved

Arlee Harris, of New York law firm Kaye Scholer said that providing for children who are not your own has been done before in the U.S.

But she said: ‘It may be just an education trust, but it sounds like he was closest to this woman.

‘There’s more to it here.’

At the time of Princess Diana’s death in 1997, Forstmann was supposedly one of the men she was considering as her second husband.

Despite being more than 20 years her senior he had a lifestyle she craved - fame, wealth and power.

He was the chief executive of sports and entertainment marketing firm IMG which looked after models Gisele and Heidi Klum, golfer Tiger Woods and tennis star Roger Federer.

He bought, sold and turned around dozens of companies including Gulfstream Aerospace and Dr Pepper.

He was also a 1980s pioneer in the use of leveraged buyouts, or deals financed at least partly with debt.

Although he never married Forstmann also dated Elizabeth Taylor and was seen with a string of beautiful women.

His death was due to complications arising from brain cancer.

He left two children, Everest and Siya, both orphans who were both adopted from South Africa and lived with him in New York.

Lakshmi, 41, became famous from modelling and wrote a number of best-selling cookery books in the 1990s.

She married Rushdie in 2004, but they divorced three years later.
