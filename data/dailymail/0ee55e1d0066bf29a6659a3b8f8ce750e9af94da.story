Gentlemen may prefer blondes - but it seems Argentinian men prefer buttocks, and Brits prefer breasts.

Two separate studies watched the responses of male undergraduates to the female form - using eye-tracking and questionnaires, and concluded that Argentinian men tended to ogle downwards, whereas British men's eyes went up.

The Argentinian study, published this year, says, 'There is little empirical research that has examined individual differences in male preferences for specific traits - favouring breasts over buttocks.'

The Argentines, led by Mariano Sigman of the University of Buenos Aires, took a rigorously scientific approach - 184 male participants were asked to say which they preferred, breasts or buttocks.

They were then shown an enormous number of pictures of the organs - concluding with a test where they had to judge between two women, only seeing their breasts and behinds.

The volunteers' eyes were tracked as they 'judged' the women.

We found that the first and last fixations were systematically directed towards the self-reported preferred trait,' said the researchers.

'We found that that Argentinean males tended to define themselves as favoring breasts or buttocks but rarely thinking that these traits contributed equally to their choice - but the distribution was biased towards buttocks,' said the researchers.

An earlier - and very thorough study - by UCL academics concluded that the volunteers (114 British students) preferred small breasts.

‘The stimuli consisted of nine nude female silhouettes, prepared … in such a manner that the size of breasts and buttocks could be varied systematically,’ say the researchers.

‘The participants in this study showed a preference for small breast size, although buttocks size did not appear to alter ratings of attractiveness. It would be useful for future research to include a larger range of breast sizes and shapes.'
