It may not be surprising that more than 24 million Britons log on to Facebook to send messages and update their profile every day.

But the social network has announced that over 80 per cent of users access the website on their tablet or smartphone in the UK.

Facebook said the UK is leading the big move to mobile in Europe as it released numbers confirming the number of Britons using its network for the first time.

The social network said more than a third of the population use its website every day, with 33 million people logging on every month.

A total of 83 per cent of daily users access the social network on their tablet or smartphone.

James Quarles, regional director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Facebook, told Josh Halliday at The Guardian that the UK is among the countries taking the lead out of its 1.1 billion global users, in making a massive shift to mobile.

Mr Quarles said: 'People start the day with Facebook and 
especially in the UK, which is a very big mobile market, there is a very
high percentage of people signing in on smartphones.'

Around 26 million Britons use their smartphone or tablet to log onto Facebook each month, with some 20 million people doing so daily.

It is the first time Facebook has 
revealed how many people use its website on a daily basis in the UK, 
perhaps in a bid to quash rumours that its popularity has peaked.

Facebook said figures show the social network has a daily reach which exceeds many platforms monthly user figures - such as Twitter, which has 10 million registered users in the UK - as well as to help the industry better understand media consumption.

A Facebook spokesman told MailOnline: 'We believe that understanding who comes back at least once a month is only part of the picture.

'Businesses should focus on people who 
come back online every single day, because that is how they live their 
lives...For advertisers, this will help them create campaigns that can 
reach the right people at the right time on both desktop and mobile.'

Facebook has reportedly claimed reports of falling visitor numbers are unrepresentative and Quarles said mobile usage in the UK has actually increased by 20 percent.

The social network has been talking up its engaged users in a bid to entice advertisers to reach people who access he site on their smartphone.

Facebook's Chairman and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has openly said the website is focusing on mobile as a way of increasingly monetising Facebook.

Mobile revenue now comprises 41 per cent of its $1.6 billion advertising revenue for the second-quarter of 2012, according to the company' latest financial results.

Quarles likened Facebook's enormous mobile reach of 20 million people daily - to shows like the X-Factor that the Guardian said pulls in over Â£100 million viewers for ITV at its peak.

He said: 'If you think about television 
events like Britain's Got Talent or The X Factor, 20 million available 
throughout Facebook daily is double what that audience would be.

'We want to reflect to marketers that mobile is now a big part of the first screen. We have absolutely seen significant demand for it and as they consider places to follow time spent, the graduation to mobile is increasingly going to happen.'
