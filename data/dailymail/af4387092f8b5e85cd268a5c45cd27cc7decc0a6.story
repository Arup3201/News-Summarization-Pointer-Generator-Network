With the ability to fly at 630mph while making barely a whisper of noise, this poor bird never stood a chance.

This is the moment a buzzard was hit and killed by a US Air Force B-2 stealth bomber as it quietly landed at RAF Fairford in Swindon, Wiltshire.

Photographer Matt Morris was taking pictures of the aircraft with friends but did not realise the bird strike happened until he examined his pictures the next day.

Clear of danger: The bird seemed to be a safe distance from the B-2 Spirit as it flew away from its wing

Final moments: But quickly the bird was in trouble and can be seen here on the left hand side of the picture already under its fuselage

'I couldn’t believe it at first' he said.

'The B-2 hasn’t been in the UK for five years and to get a glimpse of it landing is a sight itself for plane-spotters, but to actually witness the moment a bird hits it is truly extraordinary' he added.

The bird, believed to be a buzzard based on the pattern on its wings, is seen in the distance at first.

The next image shows how it glides the the right of the $737million aircraft.

But the bomber is quickly behind it and then the buzzard was sucked into the engines followed by a puff of feathers.

Graceful: Photographer Matt Morris did not notice the bird strike until he inspected the pictures the following day

Graceful: The bomber continued its landing and touched down at a RAF base in Wiltshire undamaged

Expensive: The B2 cost $737million each but with engine3rring and testing they cost well in excess of $1billion

Mr Morris, of Bristol, said:'Military aircraft cannot sustain birds in their engines as well as conventional ones.

'They usually have less engines, one or two and can have a serious effect when the plane loses one” he said

'It didn’t seem to have suffered any damage, as it took off again later on in the day' he added.
