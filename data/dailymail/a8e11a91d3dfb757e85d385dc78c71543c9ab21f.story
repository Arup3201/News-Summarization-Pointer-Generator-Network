A married New York police officer has denied claims he skipped work to have an affair with a Wall Street executive while on duty.

Long Island cop Mike Tedesco allegedly spent 100 nights with girlfriend Tara Obenauer while he should have been on shift.

The pair would spend hours having sex, watching TV and napping together, the New York Post reported.

Accused: Married cop Mike Tedesco allegedly spent 100 nights with his lover Tara Obenaeur when should have been on duty

Single mother Ms Obenauer says he would lounge around the house in his uniform, watch TV with her two children and bragged that he'd been skipping shifts for 22 years.

Tedesco, who lives with his wife and children, would also use his police car to chauffeur her daughter and get ice creams for the children, she claimed.

His tryst may have cost the taxpayers an estimated $25,000 - the equivalent to 300 hours' pay out of his $175,000 salary.

Tedesco, 43, did not comment as he was led in to the District Attorney’s office early yesterday morning following his arrest.

He was supported by his wife Sharon.

He denies 80 counts of official
misconduct, 25 counts of falsifying business records, and four counts 
of tampering business records.

GPS records allegedly show he was dating the two women at the same time. He faces up to seven years in prison if 
convicted.

State Supreme Court Justice Anthony Marano set bail at $10,000 bond or $5,000 cash. Tedesco is due back in court on January 9.

'Ultimately, not every lapse in judgement amounts to a crime,' said his lawyer, Aida Leisenring.

After Tedesco’s arraignment, Nassau District Attorney Kathleen Rice said he 'endangered the public with his selfishness' by reporting to his bosses that he was en route to calls — including a cardiac arrest — when in fact he was still at his lover's house for as long as a half an hour.

'He was late to calls and lied about his whereabouts. His crimes could have cost people their lives,' said Rice. 'He betrayed the public trust. He violated his oath.'

When the pair first met, Ms Obenauer was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer and about a month later they began a relationship.

Tedesco was caught out when a suspicious neighbour blew the whistle.

Suspicious: Neighbors called the police department because they thought it was unusual that a patrol car was parked in Ms Obenauer's Massapequa driveway so often

Ms Obenauer, from Massapequa, assisted Internal Affairs and has obtained an order of protection over fears he will seek retribution.

Since the scandal emerged, Tedesco has put in for retirement and is currently collecting a state pension. Nassau has refused to grant him additional accrued pay -- but he is disputing that.

Ms Obenauer is also suing Nassau county for $10 million for allowing Tedseco to seduce her under false pretenses.

He had been a New York housing officer for four years before serving on the Nassau force for 17 years.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
