'Four or five' terror plots have been foiled already this year, Britain’s top police officer revealed this morning.

Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said there had been marked increase in the number of threats from extremists over the past year.

Sir Bernard said there had been ‘a change to the drumbeat’ in the wake of the ongoing civil war in Syria.

The revelation came as the Home Secretary Theresa May admitted the UK faced ‘more diverse’ terror plots than before – amid growing concern over the threat of ‘lone wolf’ attacks by extremists unknown to the security services.

Sir Bernard said the police had seen a five-fold spike in the number of terror threats over the last few years.

He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: 'We've said on average over the last few years it's been about one a year but this year alone we think four or five and over the last few months again, you'll have seen in the press, we've made some significant arrests which have all been followed by charges.

'We've seen a change to the momentum, I've said in the past that we've seen a change to the drumbeat, we've seen a change to the frequency and the seriousness of the types of plots that we're looking at.'

Appearing on the same show this morning, the Home Secretary said many of the groups targeting Britain were ‘self-starting’ and not affiliated to bigger organisations such as al-Qaeda.

She said: 'There was a time when people were looking at perhaps just al-Qaeda-related threats that were a long time in the planning.

‘Now the threat is more diverse in terms of the number of groups out there who will be looking to carry out attacks in the West.

'It's also more diverse in that not everybody's affiliated to a particular group, some are self-starting groups and you do have individuals, perhaps the “lone wolves” or the volatile individuals, so we have to look across the board at all sorts of threats that are out there.'

Mrs May also revealed plans to force give detectives investigating suspected terrorists and paedophiles the power to force internet companies to hand over details of computer-users.

She said new laws forcing internet firms to hand over information on IP addresses were "a step forward" in the battle against terrorists and paedophiles online.

However, she said that police would "still not be able to identify everybody who is accessing illegal content on the net".

Mrs May said in order to identify everyone, police would need access to the kind of communications data that she had originally planned to include in the Communications Data Bill - legislation that was blocked by Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg last year.
