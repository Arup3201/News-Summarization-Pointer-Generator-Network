The teenage victims of the Zanzibar acid attack may have been targeted in a revenge attack by a spurned admirer, according to friends on the idyllic island.

Kirstie Trup and Katie Gee, both 18, were still in hospital in London last night after being flown back from Africa by air ambulance on Friday.

They had been walking to meet friends for dinner when two men on a passing moped splashed battery acid over them on Wednesday.

The burning caused severe injuries 
which are likely to need multiple operations. Both girls are expected to
 spend several more days at the burns unit at Chelsea and Westminster 
Hospital.

Friends in 
Zanzibar City, where the girls had been teaching, have said that the 
pair received unwanted attention from young men in the days before the 
attack.

The departure of a male friend earlier in the week had left them more vulnerable, they added.

The dormitories where Katie and Kirstie were staying with other voluntary workers were often surrounded by local teenage boys.

One nearby resident, named only as Abdul because of the fear of reprisals, said the young men were angered at being rebuffed.

Two
 suspects have been arrested on Zanzibar in connection with the  acid 
attack as a hate preacher who went on the run after being shot by police
 was apprehended on the mainland.

Extremist cleric Sheikh Issa Ponda 
Issa has links to radical Islamist group Uamsho which police believe may
 be involved in the assault.

Acid attacks have become the 
hallmark of the group which wants Zanzibar’s independence from Tanzania 
and Sharia law on the island.

Sheikh Ponda was shot by police as 
they tried to arrest him but escaped, bleeding profusely.

He later 
surrendered and was being treated in hospital last night.

Witnesses said
 police surrounded him in Morogoro, 200 miles from Dar es Salaam, but 
were pelted with stones by his followers.

Officers were seen shooting into 
the air as a warning and it is believed Sheikh Ponda was hit in the 
shoulder by a tear-gas canister.

He visited Zanzibar in the weeks 
leading up to the attack on Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup and was seen 
encouraging his supporters to protest against ‘colonisation’ from 
Christians and inciting Muslim youths to violence.

The two suspects under arrest are among eight people brought in for questioning by police.

He
 said: ‘There were a lot of girls staying in the house. Sometimes boys 
come over. They make so many comments to the girls. They want to go 
abroad. But the girls told them to go away.’

Katie
 and Kirstie, who are both from Jewish families in affluent Hampstead, 
north west London, are members of The Abstinence Club, a group of 100 
London teenagers who promote celibacy as ‘the only reliable form of 
contraception’.

They also knew to dress appropriately for the mainly Muslim island’s cultural traditions, according to Katie’s mother Nicky Gee.

Surgeon Mohammed Jidawi, who treated 
the girls immediately after the attack, said Katie, who received the 
worse injuries, has burns to 80 per cent of her right arm and 50 per 
cent of her torso.

Medical student Olivia Moore, a friend of the girls, said she thought it had been a targeted attack.

She
 told Channel 4 from Zanzibar: ‘The two men were on a moped and they 
went past a group of tourists and then stopped for the girls.

'The two men then looked at each 
other, they nodded, and then the man on the back of the bike smiled and 
threw acid on the girls. There was no incident that preceded the actual 
attack.’

Threats of acid attacks are not 
uncommon on the island. Tourists rebuffing touts offering cheap goods 
are often told: ‘For 500 shillings I can destroy your face.’

Members
 of both families spent the weekend with the girls. A hospital spokesman
 said: ‘They are still comfortable and in a stable condition. Doctors 
are continuing to assess treatment options.’

Kirstie’s father Marc Trup, a property investor, said both girls were ‘struggling to come to terms’ with their burns.
