Britain continued to bask in gloriously sunny temperatures yesterday, as forecasters predicted that the long-overdue summery spell is set to continue throughout the weekend in the UK.

After Tuesday's temperatures of almost 27C in parts of England set the standard for the hottest day of the year, the mercury rose again as thousands flocked to beaches, parks and gardens.

The record for the warmest day of 2012 was again smashed in, of all places, Scotland, as residents in Aviemore, Invernesshire enjoyed a tropical heat of 26.9C.

The hottest temperature in the UK posted north of the border made Aviemore hotter than Ibiza yesterday, as temperatures held firm.

The balmy temperatures in Scotland beat Tuesday's record in Solent, Hampshire by 0.2C, though forecaster anticipated that record could be eclipsed by sunny spells in other parts of England.

South of the border, Thorney Island, near Solent, Hampshire, experienced highs of 25.3C by mid-afternoon on Wednesday, while Spadeadam in Cumbria also enjoyed the same temperature.

Met Office experts said that, although some breezes were expected across Britain in days to come, the sunny weather was generally expected to hold out in weather which is 'very warm for the time of year'.

The warmer-than-average temperatures saw the UK heat climb higher than several other European cities, including Rome, where the temperature yesterday was between 4 and 5C lower than many parts of the UK.

Forecaster Helen Chivers said yesterday: 'It should stay sunny for the next four days.

'There will be subtle changes from day to day, and there may some more colder air tomorrow, but overall places will have plenty of sun throughout the weekend.

'There might be quite a breeze in some parts of the country on Friday, but we are still looking at temperatures in the low to mid 20s, which is very warm for the time of year.'

The wonderful May temperatures are a far cry from the chilly weekend, which followed the wettest April on record and one of the coldest starts to May in decades.

A high like Tuesday's has not been seen for almost two months, with the south coast outshining the peak temperature of 23.6C enjoyed in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, on March 27.

Those able to make the most of the midweek sunny spell rushed to the country's parks and coasts.

It follows weeks of weather so wet that officials have had to coin a new name for the strange situation whereby Britain found itself hit simultaneously by both floods and hosepipe bans.

Environmental Stress due to Rainfall Deficit, or ‘ESRD’ for short, is the term being employed by the Environment Agency. The agency admits it is not exactly catchy but believes it best describes the situation in the 19 counties no longer in drought.

And this is only the start of it. They plan to create ‘more sophisticated terminology’ to describe an array of dry conditions, and address concerns that the term drought is too ‘blunt’.

The aim is to prevent a repeat of the situation this year where people were told that their areas were officially in drought despite the fact their homes were being flooded.

In future, dry conditions could be divided into a number of sub-categories to describe the level of water shortage and who is affected.

The drought was rained off for much of the South West and the Midlands ten days ago after more than double the average rainfall last month.

It is still in force in the east of England, where hosepipes are banned.

Heavy downpours saw 150 properties flooded, 75 flood warnings issued and more than 10,000 phone calls to a flood helpline.
