Actress Caitlin Gerard, who plays teenage meth addict Aubry Taylor in the controversial new ABC series American Crime, won the role after producers were blown away by the chemistry between her and her on-screen lover Elvis Nolasco, who plays Carter Nix.

But the real sparks  flew when the pretty 26-year-old arrived on set last summer in Austin, Texas to shoot the show's pilot, and was introduced her to 54-year-old co-star Timothy Hutton. 

Now sources tell Daily Mail Online that the two are secretly living together.

'Even though Caitlin wasn't born until 1988 – seven years after Tim won his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Ordinary People – she fell head over heels in love with him,' says a source.

'And after quietly dating for several months, he's asked her to move into his new Austin, Texas home with him and his oldest son.

'This is the first super serious relationship for Caitlin, who portrays a teen on the new series,' says the source. 'Tim, on the other hand, has been married and divorced twice.' 

His first marriage to actress Debra Winger lasted from 1986 to 1990, and produced their 27-year-old son Noah. His second walk down the aisle was with illustrator Aurore Discard d'Estaing - niece of former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing – and that eight-year union produced another son, Milo, 13.

The source says that, as taken as Caitlin was with her 28-years-senior co-star, he was just as smitten with her.

'Tim, [who plays Russ, the ex-husband of a character played by Felicity Huffman] loved Caitlin's wacky sense of humor and was impressed with the fact she's fluent in both French and German,' says the source.

First wife: Hutton's first marriage to actress Debra Winger lasted from 1986 to 1990. They have a  27-year-old son Noah.

'She's also extremely talented, having starred in such films as Magic Mike, Smiley and the Social Network. And she's made her mark as a model doing print work for clothing companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Rag and Hollister.

'Caitlin also studied at the French school, the Lycee International in Los Angeles, and attended UCLA, so she's got both beauty and brains.'

And while the perky blonde actress has mostly dated non-Hollywood types, Hutton, who is part owner of the New York eatery P.J. Clarke's, and son of the late actor Jim Hutton, is known for having hooked up with a bevy of Hollywood beauties.

'Tim's dated some very high-profile types,' says the source. 'His romantic conquests include Ronald Reagan's daughter Patti Davis, actresses Diane Lane, Mary Louise Parker, Angelina Jolie, Roseanna Arquette, and Downton Abby star Elizabeth McGovern. 

'It's rumored that Angelina was so heartbroken when he called it quits that she had an 'H' tattooed on her wrist because of her love for him.'

American Crime is filmed in Austin, Texas. And there are already talks that the series, which won its time slot last week when it premiered, will be picked up for a second season; thus allowing the couple to stay put in the Austin home they now share. 

'Tim's son Noah – who ironically is just a year older than Caitlin- stays with the couple when he's in Austin,' says the source. 'He's following in his famous parent's footsteps, working as a producer and director, and is currently involved with a 15-year-long project called Mapping of the Human Brain and everyone says he's brilliant.

'He and Caitlin really hit it off and why shouldn't they… they are basically the same age.

'Tim and Caitlin have been trying to keep their love under wraps,' adds the source, 'but they've been seen out and about in Austin and San Marcos, shopping and dining out at such places as Gil's Broiler in historic old San Marcos.'

American Crime, directed by 12 Years a Slave director John Ridley is a series about murder, drugs and race relations at a time when those subjects are front and center in the news.

Earlier this week the Department of Justice issued a report blaming Ferguson, Missouri police for using abusive behavior disproportionately, targeting African American residents, after the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown last August.

Last night, after the resignation of its police chief, two officers were shot and wounded as protesters demonstrated outside the department's headquarters.

And  in Austin, an investigation was launched at the University of Texas in Austin, claiming their chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon used the same racist chant that caused the fraternity's University of Oklahoma chapter, to be shut down earlier this week.

'The timing for a show like American Crime is perfect,' says the source. 'And it's nice to hear that amidst all the storylines about murder, drugs and racism that a couple of actors managed to find love on the set.'
