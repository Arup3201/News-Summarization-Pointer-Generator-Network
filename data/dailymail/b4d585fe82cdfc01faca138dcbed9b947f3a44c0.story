Gurbaksh Chahal, the multi-millionaire tech CEO accused of kicking his girlfriend 117 in a frenzied 30 minute attack, has been terminated from his position at leading online ad network RadiumOne following a major backlash about his sentencing.

The sacking comes comes after news website TechCrunch dumped RadiumOne as a sponsor of next week's 'Disrupt NY' technology conference, calling Chahal a 'violent, angry man' who had not been held accountable for his actions.

The 31-year-old was charged with 45 felony counts for the brutal attack on his girlfriend, which was caught on CCTV footage from cameras in his bedroom, however the evidence was ruled inadmissible in court because police obtained it without a warrant.

The victim also stopped cooperating with prosecutors.

Chahal then pleaded guilty to one charge of domestic violence battery and one charge of battery and was sentenced to just 25 hours of community service, three years probation and a 52-week domestic violence training course.

On Saturday night the RadiumOne board of directors terminated Chahal on Saturday night, saying in a statement that Chief Operating Officer Bill Lonergan will be taking over as CEO, according to Re/code.

The decision followed an open later that was posted online by Leena Rao, a senior editor at TechCrunch, who said Chahal's actions were unacceptable.

'You see, I am afraid that this world is at risk of being a place where people are known to sacrifice ethics, and values, and sometimes genuine human decency in exchange for making money,' Rao said in the litter, according to The Huffington Post.

'This scares me, as does the fact that a violent, angry man is being left to prosper without full responsibility and retribution for his crimes.'

Under Chahal's command, RadiumOne is one of the most powerful online advertising platforms in the world and is expected to generate $100 million in revenue this year.

It was set to sponsor the 'Hackathon' portion of the three-day Disrupt technology and startup conference taking place in New York City next week.

But after social media erupted with outrage over Chahal's sentencing, it seems RadiumOne has been severely tarnished.

But Chahal defended himself on his blog, saying that although his temper 'got the better' of him, 'there is a difference between temper and domestic violence'.

He also said his temper was sparked by discovering his girlfriend 'was having unprotected sex for money with other people'.

Police were called to Chahal’s Infinity Towers penthouse apartment after a 911-call about domestic violence on August 5, 2013.

Chahal, is alleged to have horrifically assaulted his girlfriend - who cannot be identified - over a period of half an hour, while also repeatedly threatening to kill.

San Francisco police pulled security footage from Chahal's bedroom and used it to charge him with 45 felony crimes and two misdemeanors.

Among the 45 counts were Assault With a Deadly Weapon (not a fire arm), which in this case is cited as a pillow.

However, as the court case proceeded, a judge ruled the video inadmissible as the San Francisco Police Department had obtained it without a warrant.

Chahal’s girlfriend also withdrew her testimony and refused to cooperate

In the end, on April 16, Chahal pleaded guilty to one charge of domestic violence battery and one charge of battery and was sentenced to just 25 hours of community service, three years’ probation and a 52-week domestic violence training course.

Despite the incident in August, the recent court case and guilty plea, Chahal remained in his position at RadiumOne, as well as working as a motivational speaker and lecturer.

He also continued to publish 'inspirational posts' on his social media channels.

These recently included: '15 Things Leaders Never Do', 'If you’re looking for a role model. Don’t look outside, just look inside.' and 'When you want to succeed as bad you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful'.

He allegedly smothered his girlfriend for 20 seconds.

‘She stated she was unable to breathe,’ San Francisco Police Officer Anh Nguyen, told the court during a preliminary hearing last month, San Francisco Business Times reports.

'She stated that he said, “I’m going to kill you” four times. She stated she was in fear for her life.’

Indian-born Chahal moved to California with his family when he was four and founded his first start-up in his bedroom after dropping out of high-school.

Aged 18 he sold ClickAgents, an online company making revenue from performance-based advertising, for $40million.

Four years later, he formed BlueLithium, which was one of the first companies to track users online habits to tailor advertising - a system now found all over the internet.

He sold it to Yahoo! in 2007 for $300million in cash.

Chahal has also made numerous TV appearances, including a lengthy interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2009, a philanthropic stint on Secret Millionaire and was named America's most eligible bachelor by Extra TV five years ago.

His autobiography, released at the age of 27, is called The Dream: How I Learned the Risks and Rewards of Entrepreneurship and Made Millions.

The San Francisco District Attorney's Office issued a statement after the guilty plea on Thursday which said: ‘We disagree with the judge’s suppression of the video. The judge’s ruling substantially weakened the evidence we had for prosecution.

‘Though it is not the outcome we had hoped for, the case has reached a resolution where the defendant acknowledges guilt, is placed on domestic violence probation and has to take domestic violence classes.’
