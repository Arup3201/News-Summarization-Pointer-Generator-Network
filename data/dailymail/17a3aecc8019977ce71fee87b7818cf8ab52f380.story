For Katie Holmes, the last couple of weeks have been punctuated with daily outings alongside her daughter Suri.

But after being torn away from the six-year-old yesterday as her estranged husband Tom Cruise took the reins, Katie today made a solo outing in New York - and looked a little glum.

The 33-year-old actress kept her head down as she headed to SoulCycle to do a spinning class.

Katie was wearing leggings, a beige top and red jacket and carried a pair of cycling trainers in her hand.

Tom and Suri, meanwhile, spent a day 
out together yesterday after being reunited for the first time since 
news of the Mission Impossible star's split with Katie at the end of 
last month.

And today their adventure continued as Tom took a sleepy-looking Suri on an exciting helicopter ride.

Tom had no contact with Katie when he made a five 
minute visit to her apartment to collect their child yesterday morning, according to TMZ.

The actor flew into New York on Monday after finishing a stretch of filming on his new movie Oblivion in California.

It's been an eventful week for the 
former Dawson's Creek actress, who was involved in a minor car crash 
while riding in the back of a black Mercedes sedan with Suri on Monday 
evening when it was struck by a dump truck in New York.

No one was reported hurt in the incident, which onlookers say was minor.

One source said: 'It was nothing major other than the fact that it was Katie Holmes.'

Meanwhile, Cruise's older children Connor and Isabella have not been in touch with Katie since she the split.

According to People.com, a source revealed that during Katie's 'entire time with Tom, it was never lost on anyone that [Connor and Bella] do have a mother and her name is Nicole [Kidman].'
