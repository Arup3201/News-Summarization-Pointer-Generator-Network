A two-legged puppy has become an internet sensation after he was filmed carting his best friend around in a bespoke wheelchair that has been dubbed Chariots of Inspire.

The 16-week-old Boxer called Duncan Lou Who melted hearts around the world after being born with severely deformed hind legs.

The dog had to have two of his limbs amputated, but has overcome his disability with the help of the custom made wheelchair designed to straighten his spine.

Now the energetic puppy has become chauffeur to his best friend Ducky who sits comfortably on his hind wheels.

Duncan Lou Who was forced to have an operation last month to separate his back legs which were fused together when he was born.

Panda Paws Rescue in Vancouver, Canada, took the dog in and helped him recover before he was given the wheelchair by vets.

Owner Amanda Giese revealed despite being nervous about his 'bright green spaceship' at first, the puppy quickly adjusted to

She said: 'Ducky and Duncan Lou Who are best friends. Words cannot describe how amazing Ducky has been for Duncan through this whole process.

The puppy has overcome his disability and is now as fast as the other five dogs at the rescue centre according to his carers

The dog's owner, Amanda Giese, is confident the other dogs at the rescue centre in Vancouver, Canada, have helped with Duncan Lou Who's recovery

Though the puppy can walk and run on his two front legs, vets designed the bespoke wheelchair to prevent his damaged spine from worsening

Now the wheelchair has been dubbed Chariots of Inspire after Duncan's best friend Ducky took to hitching rides on its hind wheels

'Ducky climbed onto the back of his space ship and instantly Duncan felt more confident. You could see his whole posture change, his eyes lit up, he wanted to run and run with the others.

'I have a feeling Ducky will get plenty of chariot rides thanks to his best friend.'

Duncan Lou Who's story has been shared around the world, with one video of him running on his two front legs has been viewed more than 750,000 times.

He is given daily physical therapy to try to keep his deformed spine from worsening, and is also taken to a hydrotherapy pool on a regular basis.

Ms Giese added: 'This boy would run circles around anyone. He can keep up with our other five normal dogs and he lives one hell of an awesome life filled with love.

'He plays like a wild man, chews toys, chases the cat, pees on the rug and enjoys a good adventure like any other four-month-old puppy.

Despite being born with severely deformed limbs and having to undergo amputation, Duncan Lou Who couldn't care less that he's any different according to his owner (pictured)

The puppy is one of many dogs taken in by Amanda Giese and her family at Panda Paws Rescue Centre

'He isn't suffering, he's not in pain, he doesn't feel sympathy for himself and he doesn't care whatsoever that he's any different.

'The chair is to help take strain off of his spine. It's our hopes that it'll protect, support and straighten his spine. Lessening the risk of major spinal damage.'

Panda Paws Rescue are a family owned canine rescue run by Amanda Giese, Gary Walters and their two children Beast and Jade.

Ms Giese added: 'To us, every dog deserves to live a pain-free, healthy, happy life.

'Even if they have different abilities to others.'
