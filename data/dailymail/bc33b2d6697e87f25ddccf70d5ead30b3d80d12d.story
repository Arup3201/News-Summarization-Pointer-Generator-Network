A set of rare photographs which show former US President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie relaxing on vacation in Cape Cod will go up for auction later this month.

The candid images were taken by Washington Post heiress Katharine Graham at Listerine heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon's Cape Cod beach shack in August 1961, just two years before JFK's assassination and show the couple enjoying a laid-back holiday in the company of some of their closest friends and family, including Mrs Mellon and her banker husband Paul.

In one series of photos, JFK can be seen eating a relaxed meal outside on the deck, while deep in conversation with his host Mrs Mellon. His wife is pictured just a few meters away, seated alongside Mr Mellon.

Happy and relaxed: The images, including this one of former US President John F. Kennedy and Listerine heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, are set to go up for auction on February 19

Laid-back: Jackie (R) and her host, banker Paul Mellon, are pictured chatting on what appears to be the deck of the Cape Cod property

Style icon: Jackie Kennedy (R), who was known for her impeccable fashion taste, is pictured in many of the images looking incredibly casual and carefree 

Another set of  images, which will be auctioned off by RR Auction House on February 19, shows the then-44-year-old former President enjoying a swim in the bay alongside a male companion, before climbing up out of the water and onto what appears to be a dock, while reaching for a towel.

None of the images seem to show JFK wearing his back brace, which was designed to help alleviate his chronic back pain - and which he is believed to have been wearing on the day of his death.

Meanwhile, a usually-immaculate Jackie can be seen looking carefree and relaxed, wearing a casual collection of beachwear - a far cry from the high-end fashions she was usually pictured in.

One image shows her enjoying a cigarette, while deep in discussion with a male friend. 

'They're amazing pictures,' author Pamela Keogh, author of Jackie Style, told People.

A rare moment of calm: None of the images seem to show JFK wearing his back brace, which was designed to help alleviate his chronic back pain - and which he is believed to have been wearing on the day of his death

'These were the masters of the universe in their downtime, sitting on beach chairs, smoking and eating clam chowder. 

'[JFK] is not in perfect shape and Jackie's wearing a bathing suit your mother might have worn.

'This is not Jackie in French couture. They don't even look like they know they were being photographed.'

Other guests pictured in the images include JFK's closest sister Eunice, artist William Walton, Katherine Graham's husband Philip, and three of the Grahams' four children.

The Mellons' 26-acre estate, in Cape Cod’s Osterville, was located just a few miles away from the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port - which JFK and Jackie used as their summer retreat. The sprawling Cape Cod property was sold in 2013 for nearly $20 million.

The candid holiday snaps are the latest in a long line of JFK images and memorabilia to go under the hammer. 

Anchors aweigh! The couple, whose own summer retreat in Hyannis Port was just a few miles away, can be seen enjoying a boat trip with their friends in this rare picture

Bidding starts at... The images, including this shot of the group enjoying a day out at the beach, will go under the hammer at Boston-based RR Auction House on February 19

Rare insight: According to RR Auction House's vice president Bobby Livingston, the images depict the couple in a completely new light, unlike many other photographs in which they are 'always posed'

In October last year, a set of 13 wedding negatives from the Kennedys' spectacular wedding ceremony and celebration fetched $34,000 at auction, while in 2013, a Polaroid picture depicting the exact moment in which JFK was shot went under the hammer in Cincinnati.

Surprisingly, the image, which was predicted to sell for up to $75,000 failed to attract a buyer, but is believed to have later been sold privately.

But, as RR Auction House's vice president Bobby Livingston explained to People, the latest set of images show an entirely different side to the Kennedys - showing them at their most relaxed and happy, and offering a rare glimpse into their lives away from any public scrutiny.

'We've sold many White House photos of the family but they are always posed,' Mr Livingston said. 

'You rarely see candid photos of the Kennedys like this.'
