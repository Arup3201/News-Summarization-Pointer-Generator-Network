Ousted: Thorbjoern Jagland, a former Norwegian prime minister of the Labour Party, has been demoted as chairman of the Nobel Peace Prize committee

The committee that awards the
Nobel Peace Prize has controversially demoted its chairman for the first
time in the 114-year history of the award.

Thorbjoern Jagland, a former Norwegian prime minister of the Labour Party, has chaired the five-member panel since 2009 but was ousted after his right-wing opponents won a majority on the prestigious panel.

He will now revert to being a member of the committee that has received a
near-record 276 nominees for the 2015 prize.

Kaci Kullmann Five, a former leader of Norway's ruling
Conservative Party, will now take over.

The country's right-wing parties
gained a new representative recently, giving them a 3-2 majority and allowing them to make
the unprecedented demotion at the first meeting of 2015.

Declining to explain the decision, Ms Five said: 'The committee chooses a leader every year. 

'This year is a
new committee. Jagland has been a good leader for six
years.'

Right-wing parties in the country, who won a parliamentary election in
2013 to oust a Labour-led government, have long disliked
Jagland, who was prime minister from 1996.

Mr Jagland had attracted criticism after overseeing a number of controversial of awards, including ones made to Barack Obama in 2009 - less than a year after the U.S. president took office - to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo in 2010 and to the European Union in 2012. 

No serving chair has ever been ousted since the awards were
first made in 1901, even with shifting political majorities.

The
committee is appointed in line with the strength of the parties in
Norway's parliament.

Asle Sveen, a historian and Nobel expert,
said of Mr Jagland's demotion: 'I don't like it.'

Mr Jagland is also head of the 47-nation Council of Europe,
which promotes democracy in Europe, and some right-wing
parliamentarians say that amounts to a conflict of interest in
deciding who receives the $1 million Nobel prize.
