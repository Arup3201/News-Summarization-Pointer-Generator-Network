The South American rhea on the loose in the Home Counties was captured by the Daily Mail yesterday – but only on camera.

Mail photographer Mark Richards spotted the 6ft tall flightless bird running through fields in Hertfordshire and tracked the six-year-old female for more than an hour.

He said: ‘I was able to follow it for quite a while but, much like the Road Runner, it was too fast for me.’

The Giant Rhea  can move at 45mph and is said to be capable of disembowelling a human with its six-inch claws.

The RSPCA has warned against approaching it. But Richards said: ‘It was extremely timid and I was never able to get closer than 250 yards.’ The ostrich-cum-emu – nicknamed Chris after singer

Chris Rea – has previously been seen at the Barkway Park Golf Club in Nuthampstead, next to where it was spotted yesterday.

It escaped a month ago from Jo Clark’s smallholding in Brent Pelham on the Essex and Hertfordshire border.

Miss Clark, 60, who keeps four of the birds, believes it may have become spooked when the local hunt passed nearby.
