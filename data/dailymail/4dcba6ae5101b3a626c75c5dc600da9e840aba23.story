A Michigan school teacher who took a video showing an autistic student with his head stuck in a classroom chair is to keep her job, but will be suspended for a year without pay.

Nicole McVey reached for her cell phone 
when the 11-year-old boy, who has Asperger's syndrome, became caught 
through a chair at Oaktree Elementary School in Goodrich.

The video was recorded last November and was released to a TV station in February.

In it, the boy is shown with his head and arms stuck in an opening in the back of the chair.

Distressed: A video recorded by a teacher shows a student with Asperger's syndrome mocking a boy, 11, who had become stuck in a chair while the head teacher chimes in. They then sent the video to other staff

A lawyer for the parents of the boy says they feel compelled to bring a lawsuit in the case.

Patrick Greenfelder said Friday his clients 'have no recourse' but to sue now that the Goodrich school district has decided not to follow through on its initial plan to fire the fifth-grade student's teacher.

The Goodrich Area Schools board voted 6-0 in a closed session on Thursday evening to withdraw its efforts to fire Nicole McVey and instead is suspending her for a year.

Greenfelder says McVey taunted the boy, who has Asperger's syndrome.

Ellis has since resigned, but McVey had been fighting the district's efforts to fire her.

The video shows the boy, who has Asperger’s syndrome, with his chest resting on the chair’s seat and his head and arms stuck through an opening in the back.

The voices of a woman and a man can be heard on the recording. Those belong to McVey and Oaktree Elementary School’s then-Principal Michael Ellis, said Greenfelder, who accused them of taunting his clients’ son.

On the video, McVey can be heard questioning the boy in the video 
about how he got stuck before asking: 'Do you want to get Tasered?'

The
 boy is told that a maintenance crew is on the way to help and 
Greenfelder has said Ellis is heard saying it's really 'not an emergency
 in their book'.

Hearing: The school board had voted to seek to fire McVey in February but she now just be suspended for a year without pay

McVey apologized to the boy's parents in a letter writing 'there are no excuses or reasons or explanations for what happened'.

In it, McVey, who has not spoken publicly since she was placed on leave following the incident that took place the week before Thanksgiving, writes that she has 'learned the severity' of her mistake.

'I have thought about November 22 every single day for the last 5 months and wish I could change every part of it,' she wrote.

'I
 made a significant mistake,' her letter goes on to say. 'You need to 
know that throughout this time my heart and my gut have told me that I 
was wrong.'

The fifth grade teacher writes she’s 'truly sorry” for making a “very bad series of choices.'

McVey has spent 14 years in the district, which is about 40 miles northwest of Detroit.

'While
 words will never be able to take away what happened, they provide the 
only means that I have to request your forgiveness for betraying your 
trusts in me, and to let you know that I am truly sorry,' her letter 
says.

'I hope that you know I am not a bad person, but one who made a very bad series of choices on that day.'

Support: Many parents at the board meeting in February said they thought McVey was a great teacher

Greenfelder said in February that the boy suffered broken blood vessels in his eyes while trying to escape from the chair.

The
 video came to light after a staff member responsible for reporting 
bullying got ahold of it and informed administrators, said Greenfelder.

After administrators saw the video, the Goodrich School Board voted to accept Ellis's resignation and seek to fire McVey by filing tenure charges.

But the decision has upset some in the Goodrich school community, and numerous parents attended a board meeting with signs in support of McVey.

'I know she is supported by the community, the other teachers, the staff, I have learned a lot from her and I support her fully,' said Leanne Ruediger, a substitute teacher whose children attend the school.

'I believe that Nicole's intentions and motivations are always in the right place.'

The footage caused an uproar when it was released to a TV station in February.

But close to 200 pages of district e-mail correspondence indicate the three months between the video’s creation and its public airing were tumultuous as well.

The e-mails show that Superintendent Scott Bogner quickly placed Ellis and McVey on leave and set about investigating.

By January, Ellis had resigned and Bogner proposed that tenure charges be brought against McVey, a recommendation the school board approved.

Bogner, meanwhile, delicately responded to e-mails from parents and students concerned about McVey’s absence.

On December 9th, Bogner told a student who wanted McVey back that he was 'sorry that you guys have to be in the middle of this adult stuff.' Three days later, Bogner replied to a parent that some of the frustration “everyone is feeling” is 'being fueled by gossip, rumors and drama.'

Scene: McVey has been suspended from Oaktree Elementary School in Goodrich, Michigan since February and will be now undergo a period of retraining before being allowed back into the classroom sometime in 2015

Another parent added: 'There's no way that Mrs McVey ever bullied any child in that class.'

They added that the word 'Taser' does not refer to a stun gun in the classroom context, but when you take two fingers and use them in a tickling motion on someone's side.

The parents of the boy said they were upset by the support she had received and said they did not like the use of the word Taser.

'Our son did nothing wrong, but yet this seems to be another case of blaming the victim,' they added.

The board voted 6-0 on Thursday to suspend McVey for a year without pay or benefits. She also agreed to attend remedial training focused on classroom relationships and the handling of student information.

That change infuriated the student’s parents.

While the district may have hoped that the apology letter would satisfy the parents, it was the opposite, Greenfelder said.

'Through all of this mess, the clients had been fully supportive of the superintendent and the school board on this difficult decision,' he said. 'Now, for whatever reason, they have reneged on the promise. ... A lawsuit appears to be their only recourse.'

As for the boy, Greenfelder said he is “doing much better” under the guidance of the replacements for Ellis and McVey.
