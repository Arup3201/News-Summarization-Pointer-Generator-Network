Another woman has come forward to claim that she was drugged and raped by Bill Cosby.

Therese Serignese, of Boca Raton, Florida, says in a new interview that when she was just 19-years-old Cosby gave her some pills after a show in Las Vegas, and she later came to and found the actor having sex with her.

This as Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, has revealed that Cosby tried to sexually assault her at a party when she was just a teenager.

Victim: Therese Serginese (above) is the fourth woman to come forward to claim she was drugged and raped by Bill Cosby

Same story: Serignese says Cosby (above) gave her pills when she was just a teenager at his show in Las Vegas, and that he was having sex with her when she came to

Lines up: Serignese's story of being a teen when she was drugged and raped by Cosby is very similar to the stories told by two of his recent accusers

Serginese met Cosby in 1976 before he was set to perform a standup set at the Hilton in Las Vegas.

Cosby offered the teenager a ticket, and later invited her to the afterparty.

Then, he offered her some pills.

'I took them, didn't know what they were didn't even ask. I just was intimidated I guess and I took them,' Serignese told WPTV. 

Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. 

Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby.

Joan Tarshis -  Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him.

Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. 

Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. 

Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows.

'Then my next memory is feeling drugged and him having sex with me.'

Despite this, she ended up staying with Cosby, living in his penthouse for weeks, but eventually she moved out and later married.

She did however take up Cosby on his promise to pay her $500 if she went to school and earned good grades.

After attending nursing school, and doing well, she got word to go down to Western Union.

In the end, she got $10,000 from Cosby. 

That did not change what happened however, and Serginese was one of the woman who came forward after another woman publicly detailed what happened to her, claiming that she too was drugged and raped by Cosby

That is when Serignese became Jane Doe 10 in the civil suit brought against Cosby by Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who claimed he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier.

In the end 13 woman would come forward to make similar claims in the trial, though the statue of limitations had run out on their own cases.

That case was eventually settled out of court.

Now, Serignese has a message for Cosby.

'I'm gonna say to Bill Cosby. You do owe me an explanation for why you did this to me,' she says. 

'I want an apology. I want you to apologize for hurting me. I want you to apologize for taking advantage of me.'

Being heard: Serignese says she wants to make sure Cosby knows what he does was not acceptable

He responds: This as Cosby has recently said he has 'no comment' about recent rape allegations

Meanwhile, Carla Ferrigno has become the most recent woman to claim that she was almost sexually assaulted by the star, saying the event happened at a party in 1967.

In an interview on the John and Ken Show, Carla says Cosby lunged at her and forcefully kissed her at a party when she was just a teenager - and his wife was home. 

Speaking with MailOnline after the interview, she said, 'I feel so bad for these women. I was the lucky one.' 

She added, 'I mean "lucky" in that he didn't harm me. It harmed me emotionally all my life but he didn't physically harm me.'

Another victim: Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou (above) also said on Wednesday that Cosby tried to sexually assault her in 1967, when she was just a teenager

Showing support: Actor Stacey Dash tweeted her support for Cosby on Wednesday

Carla would go on to marry Lou in 1980, and said she did not even share this story with him until five years ago.

Also on Wednesday, actor Stacey Dash showed her support for Cosby, tweeting that he never assaulted her when they worked together, and that he was a mentor to her.  

Meanwhile, Cosby finally gave some response to these recent allegations in an interview with the AP on November 6, saying he had 'no response' and 'no comment.'

With his wife Camille by his side, he then asked that that section of the interview not be shown. 

Prior to Serignese's claims, Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis and supermodel Janice Dickinson all came forward in the past few weeks to publicly say they were drugged and raped by Cosby. 

Cosby has never been convicted on any of these charges.

These allegations are already having a major impact on his work however, with Netflix postponing the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving, and NBC pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the Cosby Show star.

Cosby has also had scheduled appearances on talk shows including The Queen Latifah Show and Late Night With David Letterman cancelled in the wake of these allegations. 

TV Land has also stopped airing repeats of The Cosby Show.
