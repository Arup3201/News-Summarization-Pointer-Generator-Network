Here’s an amazing stat: Burnley have kept more clean sheets (three) this season than any of last year’s top seven clubs. In fact, those seven: Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Everton, Spurs and Manchester United have managed just nine clean sheets between them.

At this stage last season, they had kept 19.

The Premier League is gradually becoming more like La Liga in Spain; the emphasis moving from building a solid team from the back to throwing men forward to outscore your opponents.

Manchester United spent all their money during the summer on attacking players

Teams are coached to pass and commit men forward, full backs are encouraged to attack more than defend and players are asked to play with freedom. It’s a far cry from the old days when the emphasis was on staying in your position and playing long balls from the back.

The managers of those seven clubs: Mauricio Pochettino, Manuel Pellegrini, Roberto Martinez, Arsene Wenger, Louis van Gaal and Brendan Rodgers all set up their teams to attack. Even Jose Mourinho does that now, although he still occasionally adjusts for tough games.

In the early part of my career, managers adopted a safety-first approach but how many teams do now? Maybe Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Burnley. Top teams always played attacking football but now everybody is trying to play.

The influence of Spanish players like Cesc Fabregas has opened up the Premier League

Sam Allardyce, for years associated with direct football, is using a diamond and Tony Pulis, another criticised for boring football, got Crystal Palace playing an exciting brand last season.

We’ve seen it in Spain for years, the attitude of ‘we’ll outscore you’; that you might as well try to win three points in one match rather than run around like crazy and get three draws.

It is more exciting for players and fans. Obviously, defences are exposed and in the past 10 years the top seven teams in La Liga have kept fewer clean sheets each season than their equivalents here.

Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling has flourished as defences are exposed

When I played under Wenger at Arsenal, if one full back went forward, the other stayed back. That meant we had three defenders and at least one or two midfielders (usually Emmanuel Petit and Patrick Vieira) defending too. The rest of the team was free to attack.

Now most teams push both full backs forward, only leaving two centre-backs and a holding midfielder behind. That’s seven attacking.

It’s not that you can’t defend with those seven pressing high up the pitch, it’s the gaps left behind that are the problem. Teams just run into the space, as Manchester United found to their cost at Leicester.

Manchester City's David Silva operates in the pocket just in front of the defence

The Spanish influence is clear. Eight Premier League managers have experience in Spain and only Burnley, Hull, Palace, West Ham and Leicester haven’t had a manager who has played or managed there. It was only a matter of time before our game opened up.

I imagine that around 90 per cent of the emphasis in training concerns the final third. The position of maximum opportunity (POMO) used to be at the back post. Football was about crosses. Now, with many teams playing a diamond, the POMO is that pocket in front of the defence where Wayne Rooney, Cesc Fabregas, Raheem Sterling and David Silva operate. Even crossers of the ball such as Stewart Downing are finding success there.

Teams are more innovative and imaginative than ever. Who cares if we lose a few clean sheets in the process?

Goonerriffic via email asks: Will you be watching the Ryder Cup this weekend? Are you much of a golfer?

MARTIN SAYS: Try to stop me! The Ryder Cup is the reason I got Sky TV all those years ago.

It will be so close this weekend but after the Miracle of Medinah, you wonder how often Europe can dig out performances like that. I’d love to get on the course more than I do but I didn’t play golf as a footballer because it affected my back. 

At Arsenal Lee Dixon and Dave Seaman (right) were probably the best two but you always had to keep an eye out for Ray Parlour. He was a bit of a handicap bandit!
