Channel 4 News has removed a video from its website after it emerged that four of the five people it interviewed about police relations in Brixton were employed by the same marketing company.

The clip, which was first broadcast on 6 March, appeared to show Brixton residents being interviewed at random during the Brixton Unite community event and asked for their views on police relations.

It was deleted from the Channel 4 News website on Sunday after questions were raised over how representative the video could be when the majority of those interviewed were employed by youth marketing company Livity.

Removed: The video was presented by Channel 4 News reporter Jordan Jarrett-Bryan, a former professional wheelchair basketball player who, it has been claimed, used to edit a youth magazine from the Livity office

Channel 4 News conducted the interview after it was revealed Scotland Yard had spied on the family of Stephen Lawrence after the teenager's murder in 1993.

The plan was to speak with a number of local residents during the Brixton Unite community event - which was co-run by Lambeth council and the Metropolitan Police - about how their views on the police may have changed after the findings were made public.

The report featured five interviews with apparently random members of the local community, all of whom were critical of relations between the public and the police.

Only one of the four interviewees, youth development mentor Naomi Brown, was credited with having a connection with Livity, with the fifth person interviewed being Lee Jasper - the former chief race advisor to London Mayor Ken Livingstone.

The video was presented by Channel 4 News reporter Jordan Jarrett-Bryan, a former professional wheelchair basketball player who was previously youth editor of the Livity-run publication Live Magazine.

Mr Jarrett-Bryan later defended his work on Twitter, arguing that the views he gathered were representative of local opinion.

During the report, one of the Livity employees described how he had often been stopped and searched by police over the previous 15 years, while another said young people felt 'negative' towards officers.

Two more spoke of a 'disconnect' and lack of trust between young people and police in Brixton.

Concluding the report, Mr Jarrett-Bryan said: 'I found little hope of change here but a community still fighting for parity.'

In a statement, Channel 4 said: "This was a quick turnaround project, the journalist interviewed people who live, work or were born in Brixton â€“ who also worked for Livity. They all expressed their own individual view.'

'We accept we should have been clear they they all worked at the same place, we should have made further enquiries and we regret this oversight. The report was removed from the Channel 4 News website yesterday.'

Conservative MP Rob Wilson condemned the broadcaster, saying: â€˜This is very disappointing from Channel 4 News. A distorted report could have been very unhelpful, indeed inflammatory, and I hope the people concerned have learnt an important lesson.â€™

Livity, which describes itself as a youth-specialist communication agency, has previously worked with Channel 4 to promote gang drama Top Boy, and on The Stake - a Dragon's Den-inspired programme designed to encourage entrepreneurship among young people.

A spokesperson for Livity told MailOnline: 'We feel only Channel 4 News can really comment on their own editorial policy, but from our perspective, it's pretty simple.'

'A reporter, who we know, contacted some people who work at Livity for their personal view on a topic, unrelated to the work of the company, but based on the fact they work or live in Brixton.'

'The news piece could and should have featured a broader spectrum of Brixton's community. However, we can confirm that Livity had no input on the commission, edit or influence of the piece.'
