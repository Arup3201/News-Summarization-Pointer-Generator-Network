Max Schrems, an Austrian law student, says his class action against Facebook for privacy breaches has 60,000 supporters 

A class action against Facebook by an Austrian law student has garnered 60,000 supporters who are all claiming £400 compensation each.

Max Schrems is leading the Europe-V-Facebook challenge, which 25,000 people from around the world put their names on  by the time it was handed to a court in Vienna.

Since then another 35,000 have joined the action and will be included if the case is expanded. 

The online activists have taken the claim to court as they believe Facebook breached their data protection rights, claiming the web giant supplied personal information to the U.S. Prism spy programme,

The programme is the U.S. secret service's worldwide monitoring and data mining system and was exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden last year.

Mr Schrems said Vienna Regional Court had confirmed the lawsuit had been accepted and that Facebook had been ordered to respond.

He said: 'The order is very likely on the way to Facebook. The first step in the legal procedure is hereby taken.' 

The social networking site, run by Mark Zuckerberg, now has four weeks to reply but can ask for an extension to double the timeframe.

Mr Schrems said that the court in the Austrian capital would have the power to make a judgment in the absence of a counter-statement from the social network.

His campaign has been overwhelmed with support since it was launched at the start of the month, with 7,000 users a day from more than 100 countries registering their backing at its height.

Law student Mr Schrems is claiming damages of  £397 (€500) per supporter for the alleged violations

The lawsuit is being taken in Vienna Regional Court against the Irish subsidiary of Facebook

Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook, which could have to pay nearly £400 in compensation each to thousands of activists who feel their privacy has been violated by the internet giant

Mr Schrems is claiming damages of £397 (€500) per supporter, meaning that if the case was expanded and the activists won, Facebook would have to pay out a total of £23.8m.

As it stand the company could still have to pay more than £9.9m if they lose the case.

The action is being taken against the Irish subsidiary of the New York-listed web giant. 

The class action claims Facebook Ireland is in breach of European law on users' data and it violates rights by tracking internet use on external sites, including the use of 'like' buttons.  

An earlier landmark battle launched in Ireland to find out what Facebook tells US spy chiefs was referred to the European Court of Justice by a judge in Dublin last month.

Facebook has more than 1.3 billion users and is worth around £118bn on the stock market.

Facebook declined to comment, though founder Mark Zuckerberg has previously denied any link between Prism and his company.

The allegations centre around three main concerns including:

Facebook's Graph Search - this feature lets users discover information about other member's likes and activities.

External website tracking - Facebook monitors Likes on other sites through embedded buttons.

Big data analysis - the social network analyses interactions to learn about member behaviours.

Graph Search was launched in July 2013 and appears as a bigger search bar at the top of each page.

It lets users find people who like cycling in London, for example, or which 18-year-olds in San Francisco are interested in horror films.

When a user searches for something, that search not only determines the set of results they get, but also serves as a title for the page.

Graph search uses the same privacy settings as a user's normal profile.
