Long before Emma Miller, Lucy Watson and even Louise Thompson, there was only one woman for Spencer Matthews and that lady was Caggie Dunlop.

In Monday's episode of Made In Chelsea, Spencer even declared that he has never liked anyone as much as Caggie, with whom he had a tumultuous and well-documented relationship spanning two seasons of the reality show.

But after her on-off affair with E4's resident lothario took a turbulent turn for the worse, Caggie packed her Louis Vuitton bags and jetted out of London for the bright lights of New York.

Biggest loser: Caggie Dunlop, who found fame on the first series of Made In Chelsea, hit bootcamp and has shed 7lb in 5 days - she says she can't wait to slip into her little black dress

As
 she was: Caggie, pictured before her weight loss, says she loves eating
 and while she eats healthy food, she has an issue with portion control.
 Since her time at No 1 Boot Camp in Norfolk, she has lost 10in overall from her body

Now though, with MIC's new season well under way, it seems that 24-year-old Caggie is back on home turf and keen to remind viewers exactly what Spencer saw in her.

The original Made In Chelsea ‘It’ girl has dropped 7lbs in under a week following a gruelling diet and exercise regime at boot camp in Norfolk - and she's happy to show off the results. 

Speaking to MailOnline, the fashion designer and reality TV star said: 'I've lost 10in all over, which is pretty good. I feel really good but I find it hard to sleep because I'm so alert from all the exercise.

'I really enjoyed it because I like discipline being enforced on me.'

Caggie is especially impressed with the results to her derrière, which she claims is the hardest it’s ever been.

She giggles: 'If you slap it, there’s barely a wobble now!'

Tough times: The bootcamp in Norfolk saw Caggie crawling through mud and eating smaller portions - she says she loves being disciplined and will try her best to keep up the regime (apart from the mud!)

Thanks to the hardcore training - which includes mud-wrestling, early-morning cardio, hiking and yoga - the 24 year old also toned up her tricky middle section, 'The muffin top… like most women, I think, that’s where extra weight goes first. The tummy and hips! It’s also the hardest to shift,' she said.

'I’m not exactly big, so can’t quite believe that I’ve lost seven pounds.'

Caggie was, however, horrified to see that her food portions were out of control. 

'I am a real foodie, I have an unhealthy habit with eating and I could easily have eaten three times the amount we were served,' she admits. 

'But it’s about waiting a while to see whether you’re full. I normally eat pretty healthily anyway, but I would usually have more carbs at home. I work out five days a week and do running, yoga and pilates.

Singer Caggie - who earlier this year was linked to Kelly Brook's cheating ex Danny Cipriani - also spotted benefits to her face. 'My eyes are much brighter!'

Friends in high places: Caggie and Millie Mackintosh have remained good friends since leaving the E4 show that propelled them to fame; Caggie even attended Millie's wedding to Professor Gree

'I’m now looking forward to a facial and beautifying myself a bit, which is a great boost as I'm off to Los Angeles for various acting meetings.

'I’m pretty good at disciplining myself if I gain a little so I’ve never had a weight issue. But I’m looking forward to pulling on my black bandage dress. It’s pretty unforgiving anyway but you have to be small to get in it.

'I’m going to stick to a 5:2 plan - be strict for five days then do and eat what the hell I feel like the other two.'

As well as working on her figure at No 1 Boot Camp, Caggie has been in Los Angeles, where she's attended meetings about acting opportunities.

She has also been focusing on her fashion range, ISWAI ('it starts with an idea'), which is similar to Asos and sells garments from up-and-coming labels, as well as those designed by Caggie herself.

'ISWAI has been taking up a lot of my time but I'm excited for the future of it because I think it has real potential,' she said 

The former reality TV star will be spending the weekend celebrating her 25th birthday with the help of co-stars Jamie Laing and, you guessed it, Spencer Matthews.

Former flame: Caggie and Spencer Matthews had an on-off relationship on the show and he recently revealed that he's never liked anyone as much as her. Sorry, Spennie - Caggie is seeing someone else now..

Fashion face: Caggie has also created her own version of ASOS - a hub where she sells up-and-coming designers' clothes, as well as creations she has worked on herself. The 24-year-old says she sees 'real potential' for the site 

But sadly for Spencer, Caggie is seeing someone. 'Spencer is relentless!,' she laughs when asked about his undying affection.

However, there could be hope as Caggie reveals she would 'never say never' to returning to the E4 show that sky-rocketed her to fame. 

'My return to Made In Chelsea depends on what happens in LA,' she muses. 'I do feel like I have left it behind though and that it would be closing doors. 

'I considered a cameo appearance in the New York episode but had other, better opportunities come up at the same time - however, I'd never say never.'
