Their meals may be a right dog's dinner but pampered pooches can now dine like royalty.

A new type of food bowl is on the market - and it's neither garishly coloured nor plastic.

Lavish dog owners can now treat their pets to a 22ct gold lined fine china dog bowl - costing a casual £1,500 each.

Intricately designed: 22ct gold lined dog bowl which costs £1,500. The bowls have already attracted buyers

Luxury: This bowl features lavish colours of purple and gold and is shaped to make it easy for the owner to pick up

Every last detail: The inside of the bowl shows patterns of leaves, flowers and birds

Ceramacist and designer Peter Ting 
has created six different unique bowls for dog lovers.

He has 
already sold three of them for the staggering price tag - though whether the buyers will allow their pooches to eat out of them is another matter.

Ting deconstructs 
traditional Royal Crown Derby china in Imari patterns and reassembles 
them into a contemporary collage for the bowls.

Floral design: Every bowl is uniquely designed so the potential buyer has a wealth of choice

Three people have already paid £1,500 each for these lavish dog bowls, far removed from the everyday bowls in people's homes

Managing Editor Marcus
 Husselby explained the interest in the bowls had been so encouraging it
 prompted three sales in just a matter of days.

He
 said: 'Peter wonderfully crafts these items, they are incredible. I'm 
not sure how many dogs will ever get the privilege to drink out of them 
but I'm sure one lucky dog might.'
