Julia Roberts' mother Betty Lou has reportedly been hospitalized following the apparent drug overdose of her daughter Nancy Motes.

The Oscar-winning actress' half-sister committed suicide last Sunday and was found dead in the 
bathtub of an LA home where she was pet-sitting by her fiancé John 
Dilbeck.

Ms Motes body 
was released to her next-of-kin on Thursday night, a spokesman with the 
Los Angeles County coroner told MailOnline today.

Upset: Julia Roberts' mother Betty Lou Motes is seen leaving her home in Los Angeles looking frail and upset Tuesday afternoon

However according to the NY Daily News, a lawyer for the family said her mother Betty Lou Motes was being treated in hospital but would give no further details as to her condition.

A coroner's official revealed no further details as to whom Ms Motes' body had been released.

MailOnline had reached out to Ms Roberts' representative for comment.

On Tuesday, Julia 
Roberts' grief-stricken mother looked frail and visibly shaken as she 
visited the Oscar-winner following the apparent suicide death of her 
younger daughter, Nancy Motes.

Dressed in a tartan hat and black 
jacket, Ms Motes was driven by a friend from her 
home in Pacific Palisades to Julia's mansion in Malibu.

On Thursday, John
 Fraschetti, a friend of Nancy' Motess grieving fiancé, John Dilbeck, claims the
 family of the Oscar winner are now only interested in manipulating 
public opinion after her suicide, but during her life, 'drove her to 
death.'

Making the 
incendiary comments today outside Nancy and Dilbeck's home, Fraschetti 
said that Nancy spiraled into depression after her and Roberts' mother, 
Betty Lou Motes, 'rejected' her six months ago - and that she 'just 
couldn't handle it anymore'.

'And
 then you get the actress woman who is pretending to grieve but she 
didn’t want to deal with Nancy and made her f***ing miserable.'

Nancy Motes was found dead on Sunday in a bathtub filled with water with prescription and 'illegal drugs' near her in an apparent suicide.

She left behind a five-page letter which Fraschetti claims to have seen.

Friend: John Fraschetti has known Nancy Motes' fiance John Dilbeck since he was 13 and says that Julia Roberts and her family cutting off Nancy caused her suicide

Fraschetti, who has known Dilbeck since he was 13, said that since her death, her family have been careful to mold a favorable public reaction.

‘They are crying crocodile tears. They have taken control of this situation, but they never cared of her when she was alive,' said Fraschetti.

Labeling them 'a family that drove her to death', Fraschetti said that Nancy, 'couldn't stand the rejection of her mom, who in the last six months had cut her off entirely.'

'It hurt her that none of her family wanted to be with her. She had a miserable Christmas, truly awful, and I think she just couldn't handle it anymore.'

Fraschetti admitted that Nancy's well-documented problems with drugs and her weight had caused divisions, but claimed that to cut her off was unforgivable.

‘They didn’t care when she was alive. She was a handful, and yes she had her problems, but there’s a way to deal with your relatives,' said an angry Fraschetti.

Nancy's suicide note also reveals the true depths of depression that her family's rejection had sent her to.

'It
 read about how much she loved and cared for her fiancé and how happy he
 made her, but it also said how unhappy and depressed her family made 
her and how she couldn’t cope anymore,' said Fraschetti, who said that 
fiancé, Dilbeck, is grief-stricken by Nancy's death and can't face the 
media.

Ms Motes and Mr Dilbeck were due to marry on May 17.

Indicating that the suicide note goes into detail about how hurt she felt by being ignored, Fraschetti said that Roberts and her family even put pressure on Dilbeck to delete tweets.

But, it was revealed last night that Nancy had apparently tweeted a string of vicious messages aimed at her Oscar-winning sister, including 'Just so you all know "America's Sweetheart" is a B****!!' on January 20.

That and others were indeed deleted on Tuesday morning.

‘We’ve got a person who is grieving 
so much, but then there is the other so called family who are grieving, 
so to speak, who want to see as little grief as possible for them,' said
 Fraschetti.

'It’s the rich versus the poor, the fake versus the real, he’s the one who’s in agony, he’s the one that’s genuine.'

And in an apparent confirmation that 
she did indeed commit suicide, Fraschetti said that her death was 
planned, but that she didn't use heroin like Philip Seymour Hoffman.

'She wasn’t into heroin, as far as I was aware. It’s not like her or John were heroin addicts. Come on, it’s ridiculous.

‘I
 wouldn’t read too much into where she did it, it wasn’t in some drug 
den. She was dog-sitting, and I imagine she did this, so she didn’t have
 to do it at home and let John find her.'

On
 Twitter, Ms Motes sounded decidedly unstable, lashing out at Julia, whom she
 claims bullied her about her weight when they were growing up.

'So
 my "sister" said that with all her friends & fans she doesn't need 
any more love. Just so you all know "America's Sweetheart" is a B****!!'
 she tweeted on January 20, referring to Roberts.

'Do
 you want to be a fan of someone so cruel? She's not even that good of 
an actress. Happy you totally F***ed with me?' she added in a subsequent
 tweet before claiming she'd never been more angry.

'I must admit I maybe going to far… But I never been so angry in my life. I'm actually a pretty easygoing, peaceful person.'

'(M)y own family has abandoned me,' she tweeted January 22.

Three weeks later, she was dead.

The emotional comments, seen on the Twitter handle @Dabbs76, had been deleted by Tuesday morning.

Rage: Nancy Motes, tweeted under her husband-to-be's last name online. This vitriolic attack is believed to be against her half-sister, Julia Roberts and happened a little more than a month before she died

Pain: Nancy Motes is also believed to have launched these attacks on the star of Pretty Woman and Mystic Pizza - calling her cruel and blaming her for causing her rage despite her best efforts to remain calm

Sad: Nancy Motes posted these bittersweet tweets in October - in which she laments that she is having to leave her family to find the love she craves from another

The most recent Twitter outburst followed similar rants late last year.

For example, Nancy had written previously of her family abandoning her.

'Feeling blessed, even though I'm sick as a dog! I'm very grateful that I have my loves family, since my own family has abandoned me,' she tweeted, referring to her new partner.

Her next tweets also appeared to be angrily directed at the Notting Hill star.

She tweeted: 'Hey Hag! Glad you f****ed with me yet? You’re going to LOVE what’s coming! FYI-You’re an awful, hate filled old pathetic excuse for a human.

'I must be grateful & not hateful. I must forgive. But Damn that is a REALLY hard thing to do sometimes, right?!?!'

Back on December 19, Nancy also 
sounded depressed. She wrote: 'I must remember how blessed I am even in 
this very low point in my life. I want ALL of my family to have an 
awesome magical Christmas!'

Ed Winter, assistant chief at the LA County Coroner's Office, reported this week: ‘The autopsy has been completed and the cause of death has been deferred depending on the toxicology reports. This can take between six and eight weeks.

‘A number of prescription medications were found in the bathroom area as were illegal drugs. We are still investigating whether they were hers or not. We’re not releasing what illegal drugs they were.

‘It could be a possible suicide, but we don’t know the cause of death yet for sure, which is depending on further investigation. It’s more complicated as she also had some medical issues, so we’re not sure what happened at the moment.

'We are not being specific what those issues are, but it could mean a number of reasons for her death, she could have been taking a bath and had a heart attack. We just don’t know at this stage.'

Julia Roberts cancelled an appearance at an Academy Awards luncheon on Monday.

Nancy was an aspiring actress who had worked as a production assistant on TV's Glee.

Julia and Nancy had the same mother, Betty Lou, but different fathers: Nancy's dad was Michael Motes and Julia's is the late Walter Grady Roberts.

In August the blonde had complained about growing up in the shadow of the Pretty Woman star, who has been working the awards circuit this year for her turn in August: Osage County with Meryl Streep.
