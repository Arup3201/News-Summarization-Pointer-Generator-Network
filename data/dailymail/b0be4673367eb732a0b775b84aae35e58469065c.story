The Government will commit £12 million to try to stop illegal immigrants in Calais coming to Britain, it was announced yesterday.

Home Secretary Theresa May and her French counterpart Bernard Cazeneuve have agreed to a plan to help boost security at the French port and educate migrants about ‘the reality of illegal migration and its consequences in the UK’ through information films.

The joint plan will also involve 
bolstering security at the French port, which has seen increasing number
 of migrants using it as a staging post for efforts to cross the English
 Channel. Extra fences were to be erected to protect borders.
