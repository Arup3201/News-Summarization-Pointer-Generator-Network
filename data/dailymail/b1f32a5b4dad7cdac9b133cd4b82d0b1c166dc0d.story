The family said the boy has never had health issues and is conscious and moving around better since the stroke.

Danny Tarkanian said that the stroke was in the back of young Jerry's brain, where strokes apparently do less damage, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. 

Amy Tarkanian announced her son's stroke on Twitter. 

'Our son Jerry had a stroke...he's 5 and I'm just dying inside,' she wrote. 

Jerry, who is the grandson of the famed college basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, was given a CT scan and other tests and is moving around better since the stroke, his family says

She said at about 6am that her son was having a CT scan because the 'left side of his body is not moving' and he was 'having trouble answering questions'.   

Danny Tarkanian is a former Republican congressional candidate and Amy Tarkanian is a political commentator and former Nevada GOP chairwoman. The boy's grandmother Lois Tarkanian is a Las Vegas city councilwoman. 

The elder Jerry Tarkanian, who led the 1990 University of Nevada, Las Vegas men's basketball team to a national title, died in February, aged 84.
