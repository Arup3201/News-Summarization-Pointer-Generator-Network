If it isn't the stairs that are creaking but your knees, you could be in trouble.

A study of almost 5,000 people has identified knee pain when climbing the stairs as the first sign of arthritis.

The discovery is important because osteoarthritis is often not caught until it has reached such a late stage that the joints so badly damaged that surgery is the only option.

The Leeds University researchers said that Britain is facing an epidemic of osteoarthritis as the population ages – and early diagnosis is key if the disease is to be held at bay.

Detected early enough, even something as simple as losing weight could slow the progression of the condition.

The most common form of arthritis, osteoarthritis is caused by wear and tear of cartilage that helps our joints take the strain of bending, lifting, gripping and kneeling, and affects more than eight million Britons.

Knee problems are particularly common and reduced mobility triggers a downward spiral, in which loss of independence fuels other problems from depression to weight gain and sleep disruption.

The researchers analysed data on 4,673 men and women who filled in an annual questionnaire on whether their knees hurt during various activities.

Most of those taking part were deemed to be at high risk of developing osteoarthritis.

The volunteers answered the questions every year for up to seven years, allowing the progress of the disease to be tracked.

The results revealed that using the stairs to be the first activity in which knees started to hurt.

This was followed by pain when walking. As time went on standing started to hurt and then sitting.

Finally, even lying in bed failed to provide relief from knee pain.

The sequence suggests that initially the knee has to be bent and bearing weight for the damage to the joint to be painful.

As the disease progresses, the bar at which pain is felt becomes lower and lower.

Lead researcher Philip Conaghan said: 'At present we have little concept of "early" osteoarthritis and often only see people when they have significant longstanding pain and loss of function.

'This research is vital to understanding the early symptoms of knee osteoarthritis.

'Knowing this will help us intervene earlier, perhaps leading to more effective ways of treating this very painful condition.'

While there are no drugs that rebuild the lost cartilage, exercise can help hold the disease at bay.

Professor Conaghan advises those who notice knee pain to try some gentle exercise on a cross-trainer or bike.

This will help them lose weight and strengthen the powerful thigh muscles – both of which will take some of the strain off the knees.

If the pain doesn't ease after a few weeks or gets worse, they should ask their GP about getting referred for physiotherapy.

Dr Natalie Carter, of charity Arthritis Research UK, which helped fund the study, said: 'Detecting knee osteoarthritis early can be difficult as there are currently no simple and reliable methods available to make an early diagnosis or predict how it will develop or respond to therapy.

'Usually by the time a definite diagnosis has been made using x-rays, the disease is in its advanced stages.

'If we could find ways of identifying knee osteoarthritis early people with the condition could be encouraged to lose weight, exercise, and generally change their lifestyle to reduce the chances of osteoarthritis getting worse.

'A wide range of exercises have been recommended and shown to be beneficial in reducing overall risk of pain and disability, including swimming, walking, cycling and running.

'These can help reduce the risk of developing the disease in the first place, relieve existing symptoms and help to prevent further deterioration.'

The study is published in the journal Arthritis Care & Research.
