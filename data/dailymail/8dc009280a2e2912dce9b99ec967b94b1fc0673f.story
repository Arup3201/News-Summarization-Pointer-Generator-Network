A teenage girl was grabbed from behind, gagged and then sexually assaulted by a man in an early morning attack at a Melbourne park.

The 16-year-old was walking along a street near Caulfield Recreation Reserve in Melbourne's south last week when she noticed a man was walking close behind her.

'As she entered the car park at the rear of the reserve, the man has placed both his hands over her mouth,' a Victoria Police statement said.

'The teen has struggled and the pair has fallen to the ground where he has sexually assaulted her.'

A jogger interrupted the attack, which occurred about 8am on July 24.

Police say the same man was also seen, about 45 minutes earlier, looking in the female toilets at a nearby shopping centre. He also followed a woman at the shopping centre.

The man is described as caucasian, aged his 20s, about 180cm tall with a slim build, pale skin, blue eyes, clean shaven and he has a pointy nose and chin.

He was last seen wearing a blue hooded jacket with the word 'EVERLAST' across the front.
