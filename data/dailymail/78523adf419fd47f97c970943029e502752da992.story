Hull continued their steady start to pre-season with a 2-0 win at York thanks to second-half goals from Sone Aluko and Yannick Sagbo.

Aluko lashed home a low shot from outside the box in the 50th minute while Sagbo took advantage of a defensive error to secure the win 13 minutes from time.

Steve Bruce named a strong side including new signing Robert Snodgrass and first-team regulars Shane Long, Ahmed Elmohamady and Allan McGregor.

First look: New signing Tom Ince was given a run out as a substitute

Tom Ince, Tom Huddlestone, Jake Livermore and Liam Rosenior were among the substitutes to be introduced during the second-half.

The
 club begin their Europa League campaign next Thursday after finishing 
as runners-up in the FA Cup to Arsenal meaning the Tigers' pre-season 
preparatations are being interrupted.

But they were made to work hard for the victory by their League Two hosts.

Robbie
 Brady thought he had opened the scoring in the first-half with a 
curling effot but the goal was deemed to have gone out of play in the 
build-up.

However, little else of note happened in an uneventful first period that saw both sides toil in the heat.

Arrival: Robert Snodgrass, a summer signing from Norwich, started the game for Hull

Loyal: Hull were well supported by fans who had a message for the club's owner

Close: Robbie Brady almost opened the scoring for Hull in an otherwise uneventful first-half

Bruce made changes to his side at the break, with new signing Ince among the faces brought on.

And the switches worked, Hull taking the lead five minutes later when Aluko beat Michael Ingham from 25 yards.

Ince had an opportunity to increase Hull's advantage but he fired straight at Ingham when through one-on-one.

But Sagbo made sure of the win in the 77th minute.

Hull travel to Barnsley on Saturday before beginning their European campaign next week.

Fielding offers: Ince had a number of clubs vying for his signature before he joined Hull

Brave face: Steve Bruce looked relaxed pre-match but his side begin their Europa League campaign soon
