Billie Jean King has accused an on-court interviewer who asked some female tennis players to 'give a twirl' of being 'truly sexist'.

Serena Williams and Canada's Eugenie Bouchard were asked to spin around to show off their outfits during on-court interviews in Melbourne, prompting an angry response on social media and accusations of sexism levelled at Tennis Australia commentator Ian Cohen, who made the request.

King, who won the tournament in 1968, tweeted: 'The Australian Open interviewer asking the women to "twirl" on court is out of line.

'This is truly sexist. If you ask the women, you have to ask the guys to twirl as well.'

The 12-time Grand Slam singles winner, now 71, added: 'Let's focus on competition and accomplishments of both genders and not our looks.'

Bouchard looked slightly bemused by the request, which followed her straight-sets win over Kiki Bertens, admitting in her post-match press conference the question had taken her by surprise.

'It was very unexpected. I mean, yeah, I don't know. An old guy asking you to twirl, it was funny,' said the seventh seed.

Williams, a second-round winner over Vera Zvonareva on Thursday, revealed she had also had the same request and not enjoyed the experience, but would not be drawn on whether it was sexist or not.

The American said: 'A commentator asked me to twirl. I wouldn't ask Rafa (Nadal) or Roger (Federer) to twirl. Whether it's sexist or not, I don't know. I can't answer that.

'I didn't really want to twirl because I was just like, you know, I don't need all the extra attention. But, yeah, it was fine.

'I don't think and look that deep into it. Life is far too short to focus on that. We have so many other problems we want to deal with that we should focus on.

'Whether I twirl or not, it's not the end of the world. It's about being positive and just moving forward.'

Serena Williams refused to discuss suggestions of sexism, but suggested that male players wouldn't have been asked the same question by the interviewer
