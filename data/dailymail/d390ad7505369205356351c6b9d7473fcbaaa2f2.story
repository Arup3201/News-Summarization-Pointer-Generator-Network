Victoria Duval, a 17-year-old from Miami, pulled off the biggest shock of the U.S Open so far yesterday, knocking out 2011 Champion Samantha Stosur in the first round.

But Duval also has an incredible backstory. She was born in Florida, but grew up in her parents' home country of 
Haiti. When she was 7, she and some cousins were taken 
hostage there by robbers.

After that traumatic episode she moved back to the U.S but when Haiti was rocked by an earthquake in 2010, her father was buried in rubble, badly injured and lucky to survive.

New star: Teenager Victoria Duval, ranked 296, pulled off a huge upset against 2011 Champion Samantha Stosur on Tuesday. Her backstory is also incredible

Determination: Until Tuesday, Duval did not own a victory over anyone ranked higher than 69th. She had not faced a woman in the top 20. Stosur was seeded 11

On Tuesday Duval, who is ranked 296, shocked Australian 11th seed Stosur in three sets - 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 - creating one of the biggest upsets in tournament history.

When asked about the hostage incident afterwards she replied: 'It's
not a good memory, so I've tried to forget as much as I could about 
it. I don't remember too much 
of it anymore, which is great.'

Roared to victory by a loud Flushing Meadows crowd, Duval, now based in Bradenton, Florida, enjoyed her on-court interview after her famous win.

'There's
a lot to be thankful for. I don't take anything for granted...Â  My Dad
is really fortunate to be here,' she told the Louis Armstrong Stadium 
crowd.

'I thank God every day for everything that's happened. Life is short,' the new star added.

Pride: Jean-Maurice Duval (center in red) watches his daughter's famous win. He was lucky to survive the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, when he was buried alive for hours

Duval nearly lost her father in the devastating earthquakes in Haiti in 2010. Her doctor dad, Jean-Maurice, shuttled between the U.S. and operating a clinic in the island nation.

'One morning we got a call from him and he was (trapped) under the house,' Victoria told CNN in 2011.

'He was sort of giving us his last words and said to my mum, 'Tell the kids I love them.' Mum just collapsed on the floor, but she said, 'No, no, no, you are going to make it.''

Jean-Maurice was buried alive for hours. He did eventually escape but was left with a punctured lung, a shattered arm and five broken ribs.

Real estate developer Harry Kitchen, a friend of the family through tennis connections, paid $30,000 to airlift Victoria's dad back to the U.S., where he received the attention that saved his life.

His daughter did him proud on Tuesday.

Overcoming the sort of nerves that derive from never before having played this highly ranked an opponent - let alone beaten one - and never before having won a match at a Grand Slam tournament, Duval hopped up and down with arms overhead after pulling off the surprise win.

'I don't even remember match point,' she said Tuesday night, less than two hours after closing out Stosur with a forehand winner.

Catastrophe: A refugee camp in Haiti following the devastating earthquake in January 2010. Duval's father nearly died in the horrific tragedy

'I guess I was really happy. I mean, you could tell by all the jumping I did.'

She wore a white towel around her neck, giggled at her own squeaky-voiced answers, and genuinely seemed to be enjoying the whole experience during a news conference that was a meandering affair, befitting Duval's bubbly personality - and the long, unique journey that brought her to this point

Duval, who needed to go through qualifying to get into the U.S. Open because her ranking is so low, joined eight other American women in the second round of the main draw.

Tuesday also was a good day for American men, who went 5-2, led by No. 13 John Isner and No. 26 Sam Querrey.

'We're obviously trying to make American tennis become what it used to be,' Duval said. 'We're all working toward the same goal.

'We're all a tight-knit group. Helping each other is important. I think we're on an amazing path.'

Until Tuesday, Duval did not own a victory over anyone ranked higher than 69th. She had not faced a woman in the top 20.

She only had played one match at a major tournament, a first-round loss to Kim Clijsters at last year's U.S. Open (which turned out to be the final singles victory of the Belgian's career).

Support: Duval was backed by a loud New York crowd during her massive victory

Stosur was unhappy with the way she played Tuesday, including 10 double-faults and a total of 56 unforced errors, 21 more than Duval.

'I'm not going to be a sore loser and say she didn't do anything,' said Stosur. 'But, you know, I think I certainly helped her out there today, that's for sure.'

Next for Duval, who wears white-framed eyeglasses and a visor on court, is a matchup against Daniela Hantuchova, who has been ranked as high as No. 5 and been a Grand Slam quarterfinalist.
