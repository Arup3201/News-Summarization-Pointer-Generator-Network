Thousands of people in social housing are committing fraud by sub-letting their property, research has suggested.

The racket is estimated to be far greater than official figures indicate and the cost to the taxpayer is said to be worth about £2billion a year.

Researchers for information services company Experian estimated almost 160,000 homes were being fraudulently sub-let in the UK - 
or three per cent of the nation's five million social properties..

They examined data covering 125,000 
properties run by 10 local councils and housing associations to try to 
detect potential fraud.

They also looked at tenancy lists, and then compared the registered tenant's credit activity and which address it was associated with.

The researchers also examined credit activity by other adults who were using the council or housing association property as their address.

The sublet properties could potentially be vacated and used for people in temporary accommodation, which costs around £18,000 per year per tenant according to Experian, or those who are on housing waiting lists.

The Audit Commission estimates that up to 50,000 social housing properties are occupied illegally.

Nick Mothershaw, Experian's director of fraud and identity solutions, said: 'Our initial research suggests that the level of social housing tenancy fraud in Britain could be much higher than previously estimated.

'Reducing social housing tenancy fraud will significantly reduce the cost of temporary accommodation.'
