Jailed: Marcy Cruz waited in the van while Heriberto Viramontes beat Natasha McShane, from Northern Ireland, and Stacy Jurich, both 27, during the Chicago robbery in 2010

A female getaway driver who helped her boyfriend flee after he unleashed a brutal and unprovoked baseball-bat attack on two foreign exchange students has been jailed for 22 years.

Marcy Cruz waited in her van while Heriberto Viramontes beat Natasha McShane, from Northern Ireland, and Stacy Jurich, both 27, during a Chicago robbery in 2010.

He was last week found guilty of attempted murder and faces up to 100 years in prison for the attack that left McShane unable to walk or talk after she emerged from a three-week coma.

'I'm sorry,' said Cruz before her sentence was read out.

In her testimony, Cruz told the court Viramontes left her in the van after having sex to rob some 'white 'hos'.

'He told me, "Look at all these white 'ho's," that he wanted to rob one of them,' Cruz testified.

According to the Chicago Tribune,
the former stripper and mother of two young children also testified 
that Viramontes, 34, took a baseball bat from Cruz's van before 
disappearing into the early morning darkness.

She waited just long enough to listen to one song on the radio while she smoked some marijuana.

When Viramonte returned, Cruz told the court that he carried with him two purses and told her to drive off.

They divvied up the contents of the purse and Cruz took some Dior perfume and makeup.

'He stated that the girls were really pretty and that he did some bogus (stuff),' Cruz said.

Prosecutors
say that 'bogus stuff' was what left McShane disabled for life and her 
friend Jurich unable to ever forget what she saw.

Cruz
said she'd met Viramontes through her boyfriend, though she admitted to
having had sex with him in the van that tragic April night before the 
girls were beaten.

Cruz testified that Heriberto Verimontes, left, said he wanted to beat some 'white ho's' and then left the car with a baseball bat. Prosecutors say that's when he brutally beat exchange student Natasha McShane and her friend

Emotional: The McShane's are in Chicago from Northern Ireland, where Natasha remains because she is unable to walk or talk or care for herself because of the attack

Cruz also
admitted to having falsified parts of the story to the police, but now 
says she only did so to try and stay out of trouble.

Earlier this year, she pleaded guilty to attempted murder and agreed to testify against Viramontes as part of a plea deal.

Cruz was sentenced to 22 years.

Last week Jurich sobbed on the 
witness stand as she recounted the horrific beating she and Natasha 
McShane, a Northern Irish exchange student, suffered in Bucktown in 
Chicago three years ago.

McShane,
who had been in Chicago for just three months at the time of the 
attack, suffered the worst injuries and is now unable to walk or talk 
and requires around-the-clock care.

Victim: Natasha McShane, 27, is unable to walk or talk after she was brutally beaten with a baseball bat in Chicago in 2010. Her family have decided to keep her in the dark about her alleged attacker's trial

Jurich recalled in court how, after a night of dancing on April 23, 2010, they were walking through a lit viaduct when she was smacked across the back of her head, the Chicago Tribune reported.

'I heard my head being hit and felt 
excruciating pain and sort of lost my equilibrium and just had this 
taste in my mouth almost like a battery or metallic flavor,' Jurich 
testified.

Her skull was cracked open and she stumbled to see McShane being hit across the head with a bat.

'She went down immediately,' Jurich said. 'She just 
lifelessly fell into the sidewalk.'

The attacker then struck her again, she said, and called her a 'stupid b****' as he tore the women's purses from them and fled.

Jurich cried as she looked at a photograph of the red jacket she used to try to stop the blood pouring from her friend's head.

'The blood started coming out of her 
head,' she explained. 'I took off my jacket and tried to support her 
head as well as I could. Then I got up and ran for help.'

McShane's family flew from Silverbridge in County Armagh, Northern Ireland for the trial.

They
had previously said they were not going to tell their daughter about 
the trial as they did not want to bring back painful memories.

Her
mother Sheila testified about her daughter's devastating injuries - and
how she has changed from the vibrant, outgoing student to a woman 
combined to a wheelchair and unable to speak.

Sheila sometimes referred to her daughter in the past tense as she testified.

The jury was shown three videos of 
McShane's daily struggles. One showed her struggling to drink from a cup
- using both of her hands and lowering her head to drink.

Her parents must cut her food and she 
is unable to tell them when she needs the bathroom. She has gained 
weight because of her lack of mobility and can only say 'Sinn' - the 
Gaelic word for 'we' or 'us'.

Jurich
needed 15 staples in her head after the attack but has been able to 
return to work. She testified that she is too frightened to drive after 
losing her peripheral vision in the beating.

Assistant State's Attorney Margaret 
Ogarek said there was evidence tying Viramontes to the attack, such as 
his fingerprints on McShane's bag which was later found at a gas 
station.

An alleged accomplice, Marcy 
Cruz, 28, claimed that he had spoken about robbing someone that night 
and after she parked the car, he jumped out before returning with the 
two purses.

But Viramontes' lawyer, Assistant Public Defender David Dunne, told jurors the attack was a tragedy but that his client had nothing to do with it.

He said that Jurich had first called her attacker a black man but Viramontes is Hispanic.

The trial, which continues on Thursday, had been delayed for three years due to legal wrangling over DNA evidence.
