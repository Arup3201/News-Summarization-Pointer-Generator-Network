'Selfie this, selfie that' we hear you say. It is probably the most overused word of 2014 but don't write it off just yet because the photographic phenomenon is doing really great things.

First, women across the country wiped off their make-up for the #barefaceselfie and raised money for cancer and now a new craze is sweeping the net which sees people kicking off their shoes for charity and posting a #barefootselfie.

But why? Well, because, according to the charity Shoe Aid 60 million people across the globe go without the most basic item of clothing every day - footwear.

In a bid to raise awareness of the problem, Shoe Aid want to see snaps of your bare feet using the hashtag barefootselfie.

A new hashtag on Twitter is encouraging people to post barefoot selfies in order to raise awareness of those who have to go without footwear

The movement is gathering considerable pace and has already seen several celebrities jump on board to help support the cause.

Neighbours actor, Bryn Lucas and West End star Connie Fisher shared their barefoot selfies in water where as journalists, Mary Anne Sieghart and Cathy Newman chose to display their polished piggies for the campaign.

The campaign is in association with and to help raise the profile of Shoe Aid's annual charity event in Nottingham - The Barefoot Walk.

The walk aims to draw people's attention to the plight of those around the world who go barefoot every day through no choice of their own.

The movement was founded by Lee Todd who was moved to take action when he saw footage of the Boxing Day Tsunami in 2004 where people had lost everything - right down to the shoes on their feet.

Lee started the charity Shoe Aid which collects unwanted shoes and sends them to places they are needed after discovering that in the UK alone we throw away over 2 million pairs of shoes every week.

So far, Shoe Aid has sent over 30,000 pairs of shoes to Africa with the help of The National Police Aid Convoy.

The Barefoot Walk is now in it's third year and the 2014 event in Nottingham is hoping to break the world record for the largest barefoot walk and will do so if 7,050 people join the event.

The Barefoot Walk raises money by charging people to register. Walkers can also download a sponsorship form and ask for additional sponsorship money.

The money can then either go to The Barefoot Walk charities (including Shoe Aid, The British Heart Foundation, NSPCC, Double Impact and Rainbow's Children Hospice) or walkers can raise money for their own charities. This way Lee Todd hopes to offer an opportunity for smaller organisations to raise funds.

Lee says that he hopes by attempting a World Record the event will be attract more walkers than ever before.

'We want Nottingham to back this event, become Guinness World Record holders and show the world what we can do'

He adds that going barefoot for a day is something that the walkers are really enthusiastic about.

'People get 
excited about it because taking your shoes off is a natural thing, 
walking on grass feels great - especially when you know you're raising 
money for a great cause.'

Toby Hewson, Event Organiser says that by welcoming various charities The Barefoot Walk is seeing a growing interest with the event having expanded enormously since its humble beginnings.

'We have a saying in the Barefoot events team - "Everybody Welcome - Everybody Wins" - because the more charities who get on board, the more successful the event will be and the more people we can help

'It's not a big distance and it's not a race, there is no competition at The Barefoot Walk - just a feeling of everyone coming together for a good time and to raise money for charity.

'In 2012 this event was 30 people and two dogs. In 2013 we put on a great event for hundreds of people. 2014 is going to be huge with thousands predicted to be involved.'

The Barefoot Walk Nottingham will take place on Sunday 7th September at Wollaton Park. To find out more please visit nottinghambarefootfestival.com
