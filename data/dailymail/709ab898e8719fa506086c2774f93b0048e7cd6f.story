Martha Stewart's younger sister, Laura Plimpton, has died unexpectedly after suffering a brain aneurysm while at home.

The death was announced in an email sent to staff at Stewart's lifestyle company, where Ms Plimpton held a senior role.

The 59-year-old had joined the company shortly after her husband died from cancer, when Stewart helped Ms Plimpton find a house and offered her a job to help get her back on her feet.

In her email to staff, seen by MailOnline, Stewart wrote: 'My youngest sister, and the youngest of the six Kostyra siblings, Laura Kostyra Plimpton, passed away today in Norwalk Hospital. Laura worked for me and the company for more than 25 years.'

She explained that her sister had started to feel unwell after finishing her morning workout. She was able to call for her help from her second husband, Randy, and was rushed to hospital.

The mother-of-three, who used to write scripts for Ask Martha radio spots, was found to have suffered a brain aneurysm.

Describing her sister as 'the very best', Stewart wrote in the staff email: 'She was an extraordinary employee, mother, wife and sister.'

Stewart wrote in the email that her sister's organs had been donated, and added: 'We are so sad but also happy that Laura had the foresight to donate so many healthy organs to needy people.'

Ms Plimpton had appeared on Larry King Live in 2004 with Stewart's daughter Alexis, to show support for her sister after she was sentenced to five months in prison.

Ms Plimpton told King that she and Stewart had a 'very special relationship' and that her older sister had been, in many ways, a mother figure to her.

'All I wanted to do was be around her, her husband, and then when Alexis was born, I just wanted to take care of Alexis.

'I would pack my little suitcase and go every weekend, practically, just to be with Martha,' she said.

As well as being involved in the day-to-day running of her sister's lifestyle empire, Ms Plimpton would create scripts for the radio show, and also appeared in segments.

Among her appearances on the show and website, was an online video segment in which she showed off her collection of Depression-era glassware, and used it to create a delicate table setting.
