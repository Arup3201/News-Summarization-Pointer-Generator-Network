When it comes to fighting for TV viewers, Twitter and Facebook think they’re pretty important to TV viewers and have spent the last year or so fighting for a piece of advertisers’ budgets.

However, new research from the Nielsen-affiliated Council for Research Excellence suggests that most people don't pay any attention to social media at all when they tune in to their favorite shows.

The study found that despite shows attempting to build a presence on social media and encourage 'chatter', most are only checking such sites about 16 percent of the time we watch primetime TV shows.

Whilst brands put a lot of time and effort into primetime ads when the biggest audience numbers are up for grabs, viewers only end up chatting about the show half the time.

 Twitter and Facebook still have a long way to go to become part of the mainstream TV consumption experience

Of the 16.1 percent of respondents who claimed to use social media while watching TV, 7.3 reported their social media activity was related to the show they were watching, but 7.8 percent said their social media use was unrelated to a particular TV show

Rethnk possible? Listen to executives at Twitter and Facebook talk about how we watch television and you might walk away thinking that Americans are chattering nonstop on the social networks while watching their favorite shows

Only 16.1 percent of survey respondents claimed to have used social media while watching prime time television.

1,665
 survey participants were instructed to log any social posts about a 
prime time TV show, as well as any time they discussed a TV show on 
their social networks.

The 
study’s findings were based on 78,310 diary entries covering nearly 
1,600 shows reported via a mobile app supplied by the research group.

The survey found that just 6.8 percent of people tuned into a show because of a social media conversation.

That
 number was far lower than other, more general factors pushing people to
 turn on a show, as about 40 percent said TV commercials sent them to 
watch, and 30 percent said they already watched that show previously.

The figures may not be wholly convincing for advertising who believe such social media networks are the way to reach their loyal followers.

Facebook was most popular with 11.4 percent of survey respondents actively engaging on the network. Twitter users measured almost less than a third of Facebook users

It seems that social media has very little impact on whether people actually watch TV shows

Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has earned billions from his company, which has recently been valued at $150 billion

Twitter’s Amplify program allows broadcasters to send promotional tweets when you begin to talk about a TV show.

If
 ABC knows you’re tweeting about Dancing With The Stars, it can insert a
 promotional tweet in your feed from a particular advertiser.

Facebook
 also introduced something similar and uses Neilsen data to reach 
audience members that it believes are in its target demographic for 
advertisers.

Of the social 
media platforms being used during prime time television viewing, 
Facebook was the most popular with 11.4 percent of survey respondents 
actively engaging on the network.

Twitter
 users measured almost less than a third of Facebook users, with only 
3.3 percent of the survey respondents using Twitter during their TV 
viewing time.

The survey 
showed that people only use Facebook to chat about their favorite prime 
time show 3.8 per cent of the time and Twitter even less, just 1.8 per 
cent.

There are anomalies. 
Award shows appear to draw more social media buzz and the numbers of 
users both watching TV and using social media at the same time are 
higher.

One only needs to look at how popular Ellen's record-breaking Oscar selfie was.

Other
 shows that reach a climax such as American Idol or the Bachelor, also 
generate 'watercooler discussion' more than regular shows.

The
 Council for Research Excellence surveyed 1,700 people between the ages 
of 15 and 54 that were 'representative of the online population.'

The data was self-reported using mobile-app diary entries.

Despite making a later push into social TV, Facebook performs slightly better on this front. Some 3.8% of primetime viewers in the study used Facebook to talk about the show they were watching at that moment compared to just 1.8% for Twitter

The selfie heard round the world: Ellen's Oscar selfie generated more free buzz and marketing oomph than pretty much anything, ever, in the company's history. The picture is reportedly worth $1 billion

The data shows the type of shows most influenced by social media, with special programs at the top of the list, followed by Sci-Fi and sports shows

The survey confirms a previous 
Nielsen study that found social media conversation drives some TV 
ratings but that the impact is fairly small. This new study backs up 
such findings.

The study 
found that those who engage on social media about the shows they're 
watching tend to be more likely to binge watch programs and consume TV 
shows on tablets and smartphones.

'The
 majority of viewing remains live and on traditional TV sets, but we do 
see that social media has a stronger relationship with the newer 
platforms and behaviors,' CRE Social Media Committee chair Beth Rockwood
 said.

'This is evidence that social media is an important part of the new ways that people are consuming television content.'

Commercials and traditional promos were the top factor in what drew people to watch a particular show with nearly 40% of those surveyed saying this led them to watch a new show. By comparison, just 6.8% of respondents cited social media

Of people who chatted on social media while watching TV, just 3.3 percent did so through Twitter, well below Facebook at 11.4 percent.

It's
 not to say that viewers are not engaging with social media whilst 
watching TV, they are. Just not at the levels that Twitter recently discussed.

Social networks essentially twist their data so show the most positive statistics.

They promote the 'most-tweeted' shows which are popular amongst the 'most active' users.

'Super
 Connectors,' or people who regularly used social media to follow TV 
shows or actors, made up 22 percent of the survey respondents.

It is this small group
 of people whom social media advertising is probably the most effective,
 rather than most TV viewers who are simply looking for something to 
pass the time.
