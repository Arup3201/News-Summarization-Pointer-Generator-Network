Thrifty consumers with an eye for a bargain may be in for a shock when they see their favourite Soft Serve Cone has gone from 30 cents to 50 cents.

The popular fast-food chain McDonalds has taken the beloved ice-cream off the 'Loose Change' menu since last Tuesday and nearly doubles the promotional price.

The favourite dessert was not the only item that rose, the Small Fries has also been dropped from the menu, now costing consumers $1.95 instead of $1.

The  menu is designed for the Australian market, and allowing consumers to take advantage of the idea that finding coins between cushions did have some value.

Consumers will no longer be able to purchase their favourite treat - the Soft Serve Cone at 30 cents

But a McDonald’s spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that: ‘Our Soft Serve Cone was 30 cents whilst it was on the Loose Change Menu which was a promotional item for a limited time only.

‘We’re proud to offer our customers great food at great value every day.

'We recently added $1 Frozen Coke and $1 Choc Waffle cone to the Loose Change Menu.’

Some Australian customers have raised their concerns over the new prices 

Apple Pies has also been taken off the Loose Change menu, jumping from $1.50 to $1.95

While a McDonald’s customer service representative told Daily Mail Australia that the apple pies has also been taken off the Loose Change menu, jumping from $1.50 to $1.95.

In 2011, some apple pie fans started up a Facebook group called 'Australia Demands the Return of Macca's $1 Apple Pies' after it hiked to $1.95.

Matt Jackson, from South Australia, opened the page and even started an online petition.

After months of signing and writing letters to the board, the page posted in June 2012: 'SUCCESS! Apple pies are $1.50 at the moment!!'

The small fries has also been taken off the Loose Change menu, jumping from $1 to $1.95

A McDonald’s customer service representative said the apple pies has jumped from $1.50 to $1.95

With some items hiking up in prices on the menu, McDonald's is still Australia's most popular fast food chain.

According to a report released by Roy Morgan, the global burger business was visited by 29.5 percent of the population.

It was also found to have the highest customer return rate, with Australians visiting the chain 2.7 times in an average four week period.
