A supportive man, giving his fiancee a lift to the regional heats of the Miss England competition ended up being asked to compete. 

Ben Guymer, 25, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, caught the eye of beauty contest staff while giving moral support to Nina Higham at the beauty pageant's regional heats.

But in a cruel twist  paralegal Nina, also 25, failed to make the cut in Leicester - while Ben found himself thrust into the running for the Mr England prize.

Ben Guymer went to the Miss England heats to support his fiancee Nina but ended up being spotted himself 

Nina didn't get through to Miss England but Ben was spotted  and has been asked to compete in Mr England

He now has his eyes set on the national award and will battle it out with 11 other contestants at the Riviera Centre in Torquay, Devon, in June.

If he grabs the ultimate prize then he will jet off to sunny Mauritius to take on the best from across the globe in the Mr World competition.

Ben said: 'I didn't go there to be pretty or really good looking, I was just driving Nina down to the second stage of the competition.

'I was just waiting for her really but the staff there were really keen for me to enter.

'I definitely wasn't keen at first because I knew I'd get a load of stick off my mates but I gave in in the end.'

Ben has been hitting the gym since he found out he's in the running for the Mr England competition 

Ben's love of taking selfies will surely be a help in a competition which is all about showing off your looks 

Ben continued: 'My mates have been ripping me for it but, to be fair, they've always been really supportive of me in the end.'

The building surveyor is already gearing up for the pageant and has been hitting the gym four times a week as well as dieting to ensure he is in peak condition to wow the judges.

Pageant virgin Ben is also practicing his singing talents and is eyeing up a Michael Bublé song or an acoustic version of Mr Probz' hit song Waves to steal the show.

He will also take on the Spartan challenge this summer to tone up for the contest.

Ben says he doesn't know what to expect in the competition and that he's going to have to brush up on his knowledge about the economy

Ben said: 'I don't really know what to expect, I think that there is a round on questions about the economy as well as talents and modelling.

'They're definitely looking for more than just good looks and I'm just hoping to see how it goes. If I can win it then obviously that would be great.

And thankfully Nina isn't jealous of Ben's success: 'I know Nina didn't make it herself but she's happy for me and been really supportive. She's definitely on board.'

Ben, who has a masters degree in furniture and product design, insists that he is just happy to be working as a building surveyor at Central Manchester University Hospitals.

But he refuses to close the door to more work on the catwalk in the future.

Ben said: 'If this turns into anything then I'd be happy to pursue it, but at the moment I'm just happy to keep doing what I'm doing. We'll see how it goes.' 

Ben says his friends have been taking the mick out of him for entering the competition but Nina is pleased
