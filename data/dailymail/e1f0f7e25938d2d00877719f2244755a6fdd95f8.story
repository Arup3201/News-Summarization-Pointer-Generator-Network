Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill, multi-award winning Emeli Sandé and model Laura Bailey have teamed up to help fight breast cancer.

In a new campaign, shot by renowned photographer Simon Emmett, Jessica, Emeli and Laura lead this year’s fashion-forward call to arms, urging the chic and stylish up and down the country to ‘Wear Your Support’.

Launching today, this year’s 
stars will appear in billboards up and down the country calling on the 
fierce and fashionable to buy something from this year’s Fashion Targets
 Breast Cancer collection.

Proceeds from the sale of specially-designed products from a host of leading high street retailers will fund Breakthrough Breast Cancer’s vital, life-saving work.

Celebrating strong British role models, 
these inspirational icons from the worlds of sport, fashion and music 
follow in the footsteps of campaign alumni Kylie Minogue, Kate Moss and 
Naomi Campbell to front the charity fashion campaign.

Founded by Ralph Lauren in 1994, 
Fashion Targets Breast Cancer unites the world of fashion as a single 
force combating the disease.

This year’s campaign is particularly poignant for Emeli Sandé, who is taking part in memory of her close friend Narcisse, who passed away from breast cancer.

Emeli said: 'I’m taking part in this year’s campaign in memory of my friend Narcisse; wear your support and help make a difference in the fight against this terrible disease.'

Jessica Ennis-Hill, who won the heart of the nation after winning gold in heptathlon at the 2012 London Olympic Games, said: 'Fashion Targets Breast Cancer supports really important research that will save lives. I’m proud to be doing my bit in helping encourage all of you to wear your support and help stop this devastating disease.'

Model and writer Laura Bailey, whose fashion credentials include her role as a contributing editor for British Vogue and ambassador for the British Fashion Council, said: 'Fashion Targets Breast Cancer has such a fantastic heritage; taking part is an honour not only because the campaign is so iconic, but also because the work it funds is incredibly important.'

Since launching in the UK in 1996 the campaign has raised over £13 million for Breakthrough Breast Cancer’s life-saving work.
