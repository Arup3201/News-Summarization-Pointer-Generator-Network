The Conservative Party was facing a furious backlash in Liverpool  yesterday, after secret papers revealed ministers had urged Margaret Thatcher to abandon the city in the wake of the Toxteth riots.

Cabinet papers released under the 30-year rule show senior ministers in Mrs Thatcher's government urged her not to waste public money on the 'stony ground' of Merseyside, suggesting it would be like 'trying to make water flow uphill'.

The sceptics were led by then Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe, who suggested ministers should  consider a policy of 'managed decline' for the city.

Margaret Thatcher was secretly urged to abandon Liverpool to 'managed decline' in the wake of the Toxteth riots, secret files released today reveal

Margaret Thatcher's senior ministers told her not to waste public money on the 'stony ground' of Merseyside, suggesting it would be like 'trying to make water flow uphill'

Mrs Thatcher was warned by Home Secretary William Whitelaw that 'emergency legislation could not be ruled out'

The advice was rejected by Mrs Thatcher, 
 who famously dispatched environment secretary Michael Heseltine as 
'minister for Merseyside' to lead a programme of  urban regeneration.

The outbreak of rioting in the rundown
 Toxteth district in July 1981 came amid a wave of disturbances in 
cities across England.

Behind the scenes, ministers were divided on the 
best way to respond.

Lord Howe yesterday said he had no 
recollection of arguing for Liverpool to be allowed to decline, and 
suggested he may have been misquoted.

He said it was a 'gross 
misunderstanding' to suggest he wanted to abandon Liverpool, adding: 'I 
don't recall how that argument got into the discussion at all.

'It certainly doesn't sound very 
considerate.

'But certainly I think the Chancellor is so often arguing 
against spending money as being the only answer.

'Michael Heseltine and I together 
introduced enterprise zones in Merseyside as well as in many other 
places which was a better way, if you like, of making help available as 
quickly as possible.

'As a former Merseyside MP, I  am 
surprised to find myself  ever having argued quite as I am  quoted to 
have done on Liverpool.'

But Labour politicians in the city seized on 
the papers as fresh  evidence of a Conservative Party bias against the 
city.

Council leader Joe Anderson said the suggestion of managed decline was 'absolutely shocking'.

Just as with the London 2011 riots, the Cabinet of 1981 blamed the disorder on the rise of technology and the lack of decent parenting

As rioting erupted just weeks before the Royal Wedding, Margaret Thatcher agreed to give police all the equipment they needed to maintain order.

Giving officers guns was better than having troops on British streets on the mainland for the first time.

Minutes said: 'If necessary the police should be properly equipped, and even armed, before such a step was taken.'

The Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir David Nee was concerned about security arrangements for the Royal Wedding, he told the Prime Minister at the start of July.

She went away with a list of equipment needed - from riot shields to protected vehicles, longer truncheons, ribber bullets, protective head gear and a water cannon.

However, the trouble began to subside and calls for a new Riot Act were ignored.

He said there were parallels with cuts
 to council funding in the city by the present Government, adding: 'With
 the funding allocation we have got now, it certainly strengthens the 
argument that nothing has changed in 30 years.

'That is the reality of what people in Liverpool feel now.'

Prominent former Labour MP Peter 
Kilfoyle said: 'I frankly do not think they cared.

'They thought they 
were electorally immune and did not anticipate what was to happen – a 
complete rejection of Conservatism not only in Liverpool but in other 
northern cities.'

Mr Kilfoyle accused the current 
Government of reviving an  alleged anti-northern bias, saying policies 
were 'deliberately contrived to make sure that there is “stony ground on
 the banks of the Mersey” again'.

Lord Heseltine yesterday insisted the 
idea of abandoning Liverpool never really became an option. He was sent 
to the city to look at ways of improving the situation.

He said: 'It never really got any 
traction for the simplest reason that the Cabinet Minister responsible 
for so much of the policy that affected the city was me.

'I simply wouldn't countenance that 
you could say that one of England's great cities, a world city, was 
going into managed decline here.

'That would simply be unthinkable to the approach that I believed to be necessary to a very important part of our history.'
