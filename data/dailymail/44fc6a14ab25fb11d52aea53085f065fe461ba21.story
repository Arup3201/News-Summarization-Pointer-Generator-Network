A grandmother of a baby violently shaken by his father spoke out today about how the child will suffer a 'lifetime of hurt' and disability after the shocking attack.

Patti VanOmmen, whose daughter, Kaylee Zalsman is the infant's mom, detailed the progress that her six-month-old grandson, Bentley, has made since his father repeatedly shook him and slammed his head against a laptop computer.

'Bentley is beautiful,' VanOmmen said following Justin McIntyre's sentencing to between 19-months and 10-years in a Michigan prison after being found guilty of second-degree child abuse.

'Bentley will be hurt the rest of his life,' VanOmmen toldÂ Michiganlive.com.

She said her 19-year-old daughter is struggling with the hardships that come with the extra care Bentley now needs.

'Her dream, like any other young mother, of having the white picket fence is gone.

'Now, you know, to raise a special needs child, for the rest of her life, and his, is hard.

'It's tough on all of us,' VanOmmen added.

Bentley's struggles began on August 24 when McIntyre came home from work to take care of the baby.

He later told cops that he grew enraged when the baby wouldn't stop crying and he threw him down on the bed. That's when Bentley hit his head against the corner of a closed laptop.

McIntyre, 23, then picked him and shook him because he continued to cry.

Bentley was rushed to the hospital, where he remained for three weeks with bleeding on the brain. He was initially unable to breathe on his own.

He continues to see multiple doctors each week and experts won't know the extent of his health issues until he is older.

'We have no idea the significance of the brain damage,' VanOmmen explained.

But there is reason to be optimistic.

At just six-months-old, Bentley is making noises and attempting speech.

The family created a Facebook page for people around the country who heard Bentley's heartbreaking story and wanted updates on his recovery.

One relative posted a picture of Bentley sitting up on his own and smiling.

'Lil B full of smiles this morning!!,' said Autumn Green Ames.

After his sentencing Monday in Ottawa County Circuit Court, McIntyre only meekly said, 'I'm sorry.'

He was convicted at a bench trial in December.

His lawyer, Joseph Legatz, said after the conviction that McIntyre was a 'young, inexperienced father.'

'The kid suffers for what he did. He kicks himself every day for what he did in that split second,' Legatz said.
