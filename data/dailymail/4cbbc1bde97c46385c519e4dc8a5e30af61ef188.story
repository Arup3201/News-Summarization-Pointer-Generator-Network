They are the innocent victims of a crazed gunman, brutally killed while visiting an upmarket beauty salon in Orange County, California.

Police last night named the eight people who tragically lost their lives in the Seal Beach massacre - a group which includes young mothers, a newlywed and a hard-working business owner, all of whom simply happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Former marine Scott Dekraai, the ex-husband of one 
of the victims, allegedly went on the shooting spree at Salon
Meritage, just blocks from the Pacific Ocean in the seaside 
resort of Seal Beach, California, after losing custody of his child.

The terrifying attack happened on Wednesday afternoon, the day after Dekraai is said to have been served a
restraining order by his former wife Michelle Fournier after she won 
custody of their son Dominic, seven.

Ms Fournier, who claimed in court 
filings that Dekraai was unstable and physically abusive to her during 
their marriage, was murdered, along with salon owner Randy Fannin, 
newlywed Laura Elody and Michele Fast, a young mother of two teenage daughters.

David Caouette was killed by a shot to the head as he sat in his Land Rover outside the salon.

Also murdered were Victoria
Buzzo and Christy Wilson, while Hattie 
Stretz, 73, is in a serious condition in hospital. Stretz is the mother 
of Laura Elody.

At 65, Lucia Kondas was the oldest person killed at the salon.

After Wednesday's shooting - the deadliest mass killing in Orange County 
history - authorities rushed to the scene and seized Dekraai in a traffic stop half a mile away.

He is thought to have been wearing 
body armour during the attack. When officers raided his car they found 
multiple weapons.

As
the town struggled to come to terms with the shocking killing spree, 
witnesses said the gunman was embroiled in a domestic dispute over 
custody with his ex-wife who worked as a stylist at the salon.

Dekraai
is said to have moved to the area two years ago after being honourably 
discharged from the military because of a work-related leg injury.

He worked on tugboats after
being discharged by the military and walked with a limp 
after a boat accident.

He allegedly remarried Mindy Miguel, his rehab nurse, who is currently assisting detectives with their investigations.

The small community in Seal Beach has
come together to mourn the horrific tragedy, which has claimed the 
lives of many of its local personalities.

Even Dekraai's friends now insist, if charged, he must face severe punishment.

One of his oldest friends, a fisherman named Steve, told ABC News he should face the death penalty if found guilty.

'After what he's put people through - the sorrow and all the people he's hurt - I have to say yes,' he said.

Salon owner Mr Fannin died in the shooting after he is said to have confronted the gunman.

The murderer shouted 'shut up' as he started to fire, witnesses said.

A middle-aged 
woman called Cindy was having her hair done by Mr Fannin when the gunman
opened fire.

She was so unsuspecting that she at first thought it was an early Halloween prank.

When eventually she realised what was happening, fear took over.

'He just didnâ€™t stop,' she said. 'Anybody he saw he was shooting. It went boom, 
boom, boom. I was afraid he was going to shoot everybody.'

'I could still smell gunpowder in the
air,' witness Riley Riggs, 27, told the Los Angeles Times, adding that the 
gunshots were followed by an 'eerie silence' for several minutes.

Bodies of the killed and the wounded were scattered throughout the salon, officers said.

Mr Fannin's family released a statement following his death describing their 'overwhelming loss'.

'On
the heels of what can only be described as a senseless and unspeakable 
tragedy, our family is struggling to not only make sense of Wednesday's 
events, but also doing our best to process the overwhelming loss we've 
all experienced,' it read.

'Our hearts and prayers go out to the
victims and their families; we humbly ask that the public and press 
respect our need for privacy during this trying time.'

Kari Salveson of Los Alamitos, who 
attended a service for the victims at SeaCoast Grace Church in Seal 
Beach, said she had known Michelle Fournier for several years.

She said she was aware that she and her ex-husband were involved in a bitter custody dispute over their son.

'She could gab away. She was one of 
those girlfriends you could never get enough of. She made you smile and 
she made you laugh,' Salveson said.

One of Michelle's best friends, Christy Wilson, who is married, also died.

Mrs Wilson was reportedly in court with Ms Fournier on Tuesday to testify on her friend's behalf during her custody case.

Her
husband Paul said she was always there to stand up for her friend 
because she believed helping her win custody from her former husband was
the right thing to do.

Victoria Buzzo, 54, was killed just a few months after the death of her father.

Her recently widowed mother, Ann Li 
Mandri, told the Orange County Register: 'Everybody who knew her loved 
her. She was the most wonderful, heart-giving person put on this earth.'

Victoria was married to David, her high school sweetheart, and had two sons.

Li Mandri added: 'She was very athletic. She was the picture of health.'

Yesterday, local youth soccer team Beach Futbol Club sent
out a message to its members announcing that Michele Fast, who is a 
mother of one of the players, had died in the shooting. Ms Fast has two 
teenage daughters.

A message on its website read: 'It is
with great sadness that we write to let you know that one of the 
victims in the senseless Seal Beach tragedy was Michelle Fast, wife of 
Patrick Fast who manages our Girls U16 White team, and mother of Lisa 
Fast a player on that team. Please keep the Fast family in your prayers.'

Also killed was newlywed Laura Elody, whose elderly mother, Hattie, was also shot in the salon but is recovering in hospital.

Mrs Elody, who was also known by many as Laura Webb, turned 46 this month. She got married just nine months ago.

She is said to have been styling her elderly mother's hair when she was 
killed. Hattie Stretz was also shot but is expected to make a full 
recovery.
