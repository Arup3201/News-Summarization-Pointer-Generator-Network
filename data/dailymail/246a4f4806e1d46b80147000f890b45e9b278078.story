A grieving son says he was forced to smash his mother’s headstone to pieces with a sledgehammer after being ordered to remove it by the church.

Mark Doe, 39, and his family rushed to install the headstone on his mother Shirley’s grave in Pulborough, Sussex before Christmas.

But Mr Doe said the church told him the design was too lavish because it featured three roses instead of the single one agreed, and because its finish was too shiny.

In a meeting held between the Doe family and the Diocese of Chichester last Tuesday it was decided that the stone should be removed from the graveyard at St Mary’s Church in Pulborough by 4pm the following day.

Cruel blow: Mark Doe, 39, felt obliged to destroy his mother's headstone

In pieces: The family were devastated to have to remove Shirley Doe's headstone after the design and finish were criticised by the church

The rarely used Church of England court is able to make decisions on such matters - so Mr Doe was obliged to obey.

The father of two said he could not remove the steel brackets holding the stone in place and so was forced to take a sledgehammer to the stone, or risk breaking the law.

Mr Doe, who owns a skip hire firm, said: ‘My parents have lived in Pulborough for 40 years and I think they have been treated with a lack of respect.

‘My Dad can’t even go up there any more, he is so upset.

‘As a son the last thing you want to do is be smashing up your mother’s headstone, it’s very upsetting.’

Mr Doe says he agreed on the headstone with Father Paul Welch of St Mary’s before purchasing it from a catalogue.

'Too many flowers': Mr Doe, 39, was told the headstone was too shiny and should only have one rose - even though he obeyed the rules on size

He said the headstone is exactly the size discussed, only with two extra stone roses at the top.

He added: ‘They didn’t even wait for us to have a replacement ready. It feels like they didn’t care about the family's feelings.

‘There are lots of different types of headstones in the graveyard, some are black, which they aren’t supposed to be, but they haven’t been pulled down.’

Mr Doe said the original headstone cost £2,200 and he will have to pay the same again for a replacement - but added that it was ‘not about the money’.

The original headstone was put up on December 21 last year after Mr Doe lost his mother in September.

Father Paul Welch of St Mary’s Church directed all enquires to the Diocese of Chichester.

A spokesperson for the Diocese said: 'The diocese of Chichester cannot comment on the ongoing proceedings until they are resolved.'
