Louise Bundy, who was a staunch defender
of her serial killer son Ted Bundy before he made a series of 
death-row confessions, has died. She was 88.

She died last month in her hometown of Tacoma, Washington after a long illness, the local News Tribune reported today.

Her death was confirmed by the Rev. Melvin Woodworth, pastor of Tacoma's First United Methodist Church, which she attended from 1951 until a few years ago, when her health deteriorated.

In the mid-1970s, Louise Bundy was a married mother-of-five working as a secretary at the University of Puget Sound when authorities across the nation began to accuse her eldest son in a series of gruesome killings. For years, she refused to believe the charges.

'Ted Bundy does not go around killing women and little children!' she told the Tribune in 1980 after Bundy was convicted in the Florida killings.

'And I know this, too, that our never-ending faith in Ted - our faith that he is innocent - has never wavered. And it never will.'

Her stance softened after Ted Bundy made a number of death-row confessions.

He ultimately confessed to murdering 
more than two dozen women and was executed in 1989 after being convicted
of killing two Florida State University sorority members and a 
12-year-old girl.

Louise Bundy spoke with him twice on his execution day, telling him at the end of the second call: 'You'll always be my precious son.'

She remained in Tacoma following her son's execution and was an active member of the First United Methodist Church.

Her son's troubles took a toll. Louise Bundy and her husband John endured jokes and dirty looks over the years and often changed their telephone number to avoid angry calls.

Mrs Bundy gave birth when she was still Louise Cowell at an unwed mothers' home in Burlington, Vermont to a son Theodore Robert Cowell on November 24, 1946.

She
raised Theodore at her parents' home in Philadelphia, allowing the boy to 
believe that his grandparents were his parents and his mother was his 
sister.

When Ted was five years old, Louise moved to Tacoma, Washington to marry John Bundy, a military chef. It was not until many years later when he was in college that the truth was revealed about his family circumstances.

Although she quietened in later years, Mrs Bundy on occasion sprang to her son's defense.

In 1999, Ted Bundy was linked to the 1961 disappearance of eight-year-old Ann Marie Burr in Tacoma who was never seen again.

Mrs Bundy told the News Tribune: 'I resent the fact that everybody in Tacoma thinks just because he lived in Tacoma he did that one, too, way back when he was 14. I’m sure he didn’t.'

The name Ted Bundy is synonymous with serial killer after the shy and attractive psychology major embarked on a killing spree in the 1970s that left more than two dozen women dead. There is speculation he could be responsible for up to 100 murders.

In 1974, witnesses saw a young man, who introduced himself as Ted, approach two young women at Seattle State Park and ask for help with his sailboat. They were never seen alive again and became his first known victims.

It was in the same year that several young women disappeared from college campuses in Washington and Oregon - including a 21-year-old radio announcer called Lynda Ann Healy.

Later that year, Bundy relocated to Utah to attend law school in Salt Lake City. In November, Carol DaRonch was attacked by a man she described dressed as a police officer but escaped.

She gave the first clear description and a blood sample from her jacket. Miss DaRonch also told police that he was driving a tan VW Beetle. As Miss DaRonch was giving her statement, 17-year-old Debbie Kent disappeared.

A short time later, hikers found the bones of missing women in a Washington forest. A rough sketch was drawn - a tall, thin attractive man who approached young, white women looking for help and called himself 'Ted'.

Police also noted common factors among the victims - they were all thin and had long hair parted in the middle. All the women were targeted in the evening and bludgeoned with blunt objects. The victims had also been raped or sodomized. 

At the beginning of January 1975, Caryn Campbell vanished from a Colorado ski resort. Her naked body was found a month later in a ditch by the side of the road. Five more women were founded murdered in a similar manner in the following months.

In August, police pulled Bundy over for a driving offense. When Miss DaRonch picked him out of a line-up, he was charged with attempted kidnapping. 

He was sentenced in 1976 to 15 years in prison and later police connected him to the murder of Caryn Campbell.

On December 30, Bundy escaped from prison and turned up in Tallahassee, Florida renting an apartment near Florida State University under a false name.

On January 14, 1978, Bundy struck again. He broken into the Chi Omega sorority house and bludgeoned and strangled to death two women, raping one of them and viciously biting her body.

He almost murdered two others by beating them over the head with a log before a roommate interrupted his spree. 

Almost a month later on February 9, Kimberly Leach, who was 12, was kidnapped and mutilated by Bundy. The serial killer was picked up a week later while driving a stolen car before witnesses placed him at both the sorority house and outside Kimberly's school.

Charged with three murders -  killing the two sorority women and another Kimberly LaFouche - Bundy believed he could beat a guilty verdict and turned down a plea bargain of three life sentences. He went on trial in Florida on June 25, 1979, found guilty and sentenced to death.

Prior to his execution, Bundy gave the details of the murder sites of more than 50 women. He also said that he kept the heads of some women at his home to engage in necrophilia.

Bundy was electrocuted on January 24, 1989 at 7.13am.
