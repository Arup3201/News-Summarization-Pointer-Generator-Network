The original Catwoman has officially been outed as bisexual - ending years of speculation by fans.

Selina Kyle, Batman's stealthy enemy and love interest, officially came out as bisexual in the latest issue of DC Comics' Catwoman.

The leather-clad cat burglar kissed another woman, confirming what many fans had long suspected about the flirtatious feline.

Writer Genevieve Valentine, who took over the series in October, wrote on her blog that establishing Selina Kyle as 'canon bisexual' was something she had always intended.

'She's flirted around it — often quite literally — for years now,' wrote Valentine. 'For me, this wasn't a revelation so much as a confirmation.'

Kyle, who has retired as Catwoman to become the head of a crime family in Gotham City, comes out the closet in a scene where she confronts a new character.

'Eiko' has taken over the Catwoman identity without Kyle's consent and the charged sequence ends with a kiss.

Valentine wrote: 'Was it a surprise for them? In terms of their sexualities, not particularly; certainly it's no surprise to Selina that she has an attraction to a woman.

'Will they dramatically implode? I mean, it's comics, it could happen. But it will be a relationship. I'm excited to be here for it.'

Catwoman's coming out is the latest of many efforts by comic book companies to diversify their characters. DC's Batwoman has identified as a lesbian since 2006, and Green Lantern, Alan Scott, was reintroduced as gay while X-Man's Northstar married his boyfriend in 2012.
