Jeanette Warr, 77, receives the full annual allowances despite living in the United States during the winter

A Liberal Democrat Councillor is representing her Bognor Regis constituents from Florida for more than three months a year.

Jeanette Warr, 77, receives the full annual allowances despite living in the U.S. during the winter.

Last year's figures show the ex-town mayor was paid £5,259.88.

She left the UK in early December and is expected to return at the end of the March.

This is the seventh consecutive year she has taken lengthy long-distance holidays whilst still claiming the full allowance.

Cllr Warr defended her actions saying she stays within the law by attending at least one meeting every six months and when she is in the UK she always attends every meeting.

She said: 'I take my vacations in one block, whereas maybe others take weeks here and there, probably amounting to the same time that I have.

'In this day and age, it is very easy to conduct business through the internet.

'Any calls that I might have from residents are dealt with from here or I refer them to the relevant councilor.'

Arundel resident Robert Wheal highlighted Cllr Warr's absence at the full meeting of Arun District Council

Arundel resident Robert Wheal highlighted Cllr Warr's absence at the full meeting of Arun District Council earlier this month.

He asked 'How many winters (years) and for how many months for each of those winters she has been absent abroad?' to which he was told 'At least seven years and for an average of 3-4 months for each of those winters.'

When asked if she was claiming and receiving allowances whilst absent, he was told she has continued to claim her Basic and IT Allowances.

After the meeting Mr Wheal said: 'Why are we paying for councillors to be absent sunning themselves in Florida at the expense of the taxpayer?'. 

Cllr Warr has twice been Mayor of Bognor in 1997 and 2005 and is a long-serving councillor for 20 years - she represents the Hotham ward - she has always served Arun and Bognor councils as a Lib Dem member.

She said she has always received permission from the Lib Dem group in Bognor to take her long holidays.

She lives on the Esplanade in Bognor and was nominated to be elected as a trustee for fibromyalgia support for Surrey and Sussex in 2012.
