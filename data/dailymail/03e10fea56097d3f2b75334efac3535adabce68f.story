This is the touching moment  a doting dad dances with his daughter at home.

But  the dance party for Eliza, 5, was arranged by her dad, Glenn O' Neil, 42, at their South Carolina home because she has the AAV9 virus and the family are under a self-imposed quarantine.

The five-year-old suffers from a rare and ultimately fatal genetic condition called Sanfilippo Syndrome and has to avoid interacting with people's germs or it could kill her.

Dance: Glenn O' Neil, 42, dances with his little girl Eliza, 5, who has Sanfilippo Syndrome and the family has chosen self-imposed quarantine to increase her chances of getting life-saving treatment

Family bond: Mom Cara, dad Glenn and brother Beckham, 8, stay at home with Eliza 24 hours a day and seven days a week to protect her from germs

The family are under a self-imposed quarantine, so that Eliza does not contract and build up immunity to one particular virus, AAV9. 

If she built up immunity to this virus she would likely not qualify for a clinical trial, as AAV9 will deliver the medicine in the body. This is her only chance at life. 

Her family have put themselves under a voluntary quarantine  for the past nine months in a bid to avoid interacting with other people.

The family has chosen to avoid interacting with people and anything people have touched.

It means mom Cara, dad Glenn and brother Beckham, 8, stay at home with her 24 hours a day and seven days a week to protect her.

Her mom, Cara quit her job as a pediatrician while Glenn works remotely as a consultant at Symantec and Beckham can no longer attend his school, instead doing his schoolwork remotely.

The family get their groceries delivered and on the rare occasion they do have to interact with people, they wear masks and gloves.

They only leave their house once a week to go to an empty beach or field, where the kids can run free.

Since Eliza was diagnosed with the illness in July 2013, the family have raised $2.2 million with a GoFundMe page and other traditional fundraising efforts in the hope to help her survive.

Her father Glenn told People: 'We heard that there was a clinical trial that might cure Eliza of this disease. So of course we knew that we had to raise every dollar that they needed for it.'

But since reaching their goal in December 2014, they have experienced delays with the trials due to difficulties in drug production.

And even when the medicine is ready, they don't know if Eliza will be picked for the trial.

'This is our only chance,' Glenn says. 'Not only for Eliza, but other children with Sanfilippo.'

Quarantine: Little Eliza's daddy/daughter dance came after she missed a Frozen-themed dance at her school

Little Eliza's daddy/daughter dance came after she missed a Frozen-themed dance at her school. 

It took a lot of planning because the family needed to make sure that Eliza did not catch any incoming diseases.

Her father writes in a Youtube video: 'Every little girl deserves to go to a special dance.'

The disorder means that the pretty girl with blonde pigtails will slowly lose her ability to speak and by the age of six will most likely not be able to talk at all, according to People. 

By the time she turns ten-years-old, she is expected to be in a wheelchair and need constant care.  

The family are choosing to stay under quarantine because other parents who have children with Sanfilippo warn that if children get sick it could accelerate their Sanfilippo symptoms. 

Glenn said: 'This is a personal decision that we made. Doctors understand why we're doing this but they didn't tell us we had to.' 

'I can't say if looking back one day I would regret anything we have done for Eliza and Beckham. We constantly make sure we both still agree that this is the right move.'
