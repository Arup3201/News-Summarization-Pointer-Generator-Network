The Toluca Lake home of Bob and Dolores Hope is up for sale with an asking price of $27.5 million for the five-acre property, which includes a 15,000-square-foot mansion, a one-hole golf course, and an indoor pool.

A guest house and an adjoining 4,000-square-foot office space also make up the sprawling estate on Moorpark Street, where Bob and Dolores Hope lived and entertained Hollywood celebrities and presidents from 1939 until their deaths in 2003 and 2011, respectively.

In addition to its proximity to the Lakeside Golf Club, the estate’s new buyers will have at least one celebrity neighbor: singer Miley Cyrus is reported to live nearby, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The Robert Finkelhor-designed traditional main house was updated in the 1950s by John Elgin Woolf to add more contemporary elements

The announcement of the listing comes on the heels of an auction that included golf memorabilia and mementos from the couple’s homes in Toluca Lake and Palm Springs that was estimated to bring in more than $500,000.

The Hopes commissioned Robert Finkelhor to build their beloved English traditional house on a former walnut grove in 1939.

It was later remodeled 'in a more contemporary style' in the 1950’s by architect John Elgin Woolf, who also designed homes for Cary Grant, Errol Flynn, Judy Garland, Ricardo Montalban and Katharine Hepburn

The estate grew considerably over the years as the Hopes acquired surrounding properties; it now consists of four parcels totaling 5.16 acres.

A main house of 14,876 square feet, as well as a two-bedroom guest house, a two-bedroom staff quarters and additional offices can be found on the storied compound.

Leading through a reception area, the home opens to a handsome foyer with hardwood flooring and curving spiral staircase.

Interior amenities include an office, billiard room, chef's kitchen and a formal living room lined in floor-to-ceiling glass that looks onto a patio and grounds.

The upstairs houses four bedroom suites, including a master wing with his-and-her bedrooms, baths, closets and a shared study.

Outside, the home rounds out with sports facilities, including a one-hole golf course, a pair of pools (one indoor and one outdoor), numerous patios and a massive stone motor court.

The Toluca Lake estate is the last of the late Hopes' impressive real estate portfolio to come to market.

In December 2012, a pair of Palm Springs properties that had been owned by the couple listed for $659,000 and $469,000, respectively.

Bob died in 2003 at 100 and his long-running career saw him meet presidents, star in films and tour the world firing his famous one-liners.

His second wife Dolores, who he married back in 1934, died in 2011 at 102.

The entertainer was often cited as the biggest private landowner in California.

Last year his daughter Linda sold her late parents’ Toluca Lake estate, near Los Angeles, along with some of its contents, in a well-publicized garage sale.

Bob Hope collected real estate and at one point was one of California's largest individual property owners, holding some 10,000 acres in the San Fernando Valley alone

The Hopes left many belongings for their heirs to sort and distribute, a process that has taken years
