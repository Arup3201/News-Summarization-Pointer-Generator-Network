'Ugly': Research showed that 46 per cent of 16-year-old girls enjoy being active - but say they are put off physical exercise simply because they hate what they have to wear. (File picture)

Plenty of youngsters will admit that PE is their least favourite part of the school day. But for the girls, it seems this reluctance has little to do with exercise – and everything to do with their outfits.

Nearly half of teenage girls would be happy to play more sport if their school PE kits weren’t so ‘ugly’, a poll has found.

The research showed that 46 per cent of 16-year-old girls enjoy being active – but say they are put off physical exercise simply because they hate what they have to wear.

And 39 per cent of younger girls, aged eight to 16, said the same thing.

One pupil told researchers: ‘My PE kit’s uncomfortable and a little bit small – I don’t like myself in it.’

Another said: ‘If you’ve got something you don’t like wearing, or you think doesn’t look nice, you don’t really want to do any sport in it.’

Nearly half of girls also admitted to making up excuses to get out of doing sports classes, and more than a quarter of 16-year-olds said they feel ugly when they play sport, according to the study by health club chain Virgin Active.

Youth inactivity is a major problem in the UK, particularly among young girls. A separate study recently found that nearly four out of ten 16-year-old girls never take any strenuous activity in school.

In response to the research, Virgin Active and the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation challenged young girls to design a PE kit that they would be happy to wear.

The winner, 13-year-old Emily Marshall, swapped the traditional PE kit – with its low-cut V-necked polo shirts, unflattering skirts and uncomfortable materials – for a more modern design featuring leggings, high-necked collars and dark colours that hide sweat patches.

Emily said: ‘I enjoy exercise and know it is good for me but sometimes my school PE kit made me feel very self-conscious.’

One pupil who tried the winning design said: ‘You just feel more confident about your body and I think that’s really important because you don’t want to be worrying about what other people are thinking of you.’

Matt Merrick, managing director of Virgin Active, said: ‘This winning PE kit design is just the starting point, showing what makes girls feel confident.

‘Virgin Active is now calling for schools, politicians and PE kit manufacturers to listen to these findings and consider incorporating them into the PE kits of the future, so that more young girls feel engaged with being active in their everyday lives.’

Old-fashioned: Young girls said they disliked the low-cut V-necked polo shirts and uncomfortable materials of traditional PE kits - instead they wanted a more modern design featuring leggings and dark colours
