A humpback whale has been seen off the coast of Norfolk for the first time.

The huge animal, estimated to be 50ft in length and weighing several tons, has been spotted numerous times just off the beach at Caister-on-Sea  in the last few days.

Local fishing crews believe the whale has been lured in close to the coastline by huge numbers of herring - which it is feasting on.

One fisherman, Dick Thurlow, a former lifeboat coxswain, said: 'There’s a massive amount of herring out there - we’re out there for the same reason - to fill our boots.

'The conditions are perfect, and the herring I’ve seen this year are probably the best I’ve ever seen and I’ve been fishing since I was 14.

'They’re mature, full of roe. I think they come back to where they were hatched to spawn. They should be there for the next week or so if the weather doesn’t change.

'We’re getting them while we can, and I guess he is too.'

At one stage the whale came within 90 
feet of a fishing vessel, which had Mr Thurlow's son Arron on board, and
surfaced five or six times.

The east coast fishermen are no strangers to marine creatures - often coming across seals, porpoises and sometimes pilot whales.

But sharing the waters with a vast humpback whale means they must be extra vigilant.

Staying put? Experts said the animal could stay for the duration of the winter if there is enough fish

Mr Thurlow said: 'You don’t want to get one of those in the nets.

'We use drift nets and if we accidentally
catch a seal or a porpoise, which happens sometimes, it’s not too hard 
to get them out before we do any harm.

'I’m not sure we could say the same with a whale. It’s a big, big animal. The first thing we saw was the blow coming out the water, and you can smell it.”

While the Norfolk whale seems to be alone, 
humpbacks are known to feed using an unusual technique called bubblenet feeding.

The technique sees groups of the animals work together to capture large schools of fish.

Each
whale has its own role in the process.

One blows bubbles around the 
school to keep the fish from escaping, while others make noise to scare or 
confuse the fish and help bring them to the surface.

Finally, others herd 
the fish together and force them upwards.

Once
the fish are at the surface, all the whales lunge upwards with their 
huge mouths wide open and try to gulp as many fish as they can.

Experts believe the humpback could stay off the Norfolk coast for the whole winter if there is enough food.

Norfolk wildlife artist James McCallum observed the whale from the shore for four hours.

He is now completing a painting which recreates the scene as it surfaced off Waxham, with a spray of vented seawater hanging on the wind as gannets circled above.

James, 43, said 'I am fortunate enough to have seen humpbacks in Alaska, but I’m more excited about seeing this one here. They are mesmerising. I spent four hours solid just watching it.

'By the time I first saw the spout there were quite a few people there to look. It was quite easy to spot once you got your eye in.

'I reckon it was about a mile off, but you could see it blowing against the steel-coloured sea.'
