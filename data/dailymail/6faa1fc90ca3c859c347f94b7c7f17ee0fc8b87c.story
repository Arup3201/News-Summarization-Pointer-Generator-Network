The hotel features 140 guest rooms with 14 suites: With interior and exterior fabric of this iconic hotel, it provides an ideal canvas to overlay a design which engages with the European characteristics of the architecture

Past the receptionist’s desk, the grand staircase opens up to the hotel’s first floor, where timber panelling, inlaid stone flooring, an original marble reception and the tinkling of the original grand piano lend familiarity to the light and lively lobby. 

The former Ritz Carlton has been transformed into a bayside sanctuary with Royal Hotels Australia partnering with renowned Australian firm Bates Smart Architects to direct the design of the new hotel.

Australian architects Bates Smart studio director Brenton Smith said the intention of the design was to reinstate the glamour of the building.

'The interior and exterior fabric of this iconic building provided an ideal canvas to overlay a design which engages with the European characteristics of the architecture, while the unique location enabled us to take references from the stunning and iconic bay,' he said.

Peter Wilding, Managing Director of Royal Hotels Australia said the hotel will be a hub for authentic local experiences and intimate gatherings with the look and feel creating an elegant yet relaxed setting for guests to retreat to.

'In redeveloping the original building, it was vital to reinstate and celebrate its legacy, while heralding in a new era for the contemporary and stylish sanctuary,' he said.
