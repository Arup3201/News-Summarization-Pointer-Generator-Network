Strippers have been awarded $10.9 million by a federal judge who found they had been denied tips and forced to pay for the privilege of working.

Rick's Cabaret in New York City's Midtown collected $2 of every $20 the girls earned in tips, a federal court heard.

And bosses demanded $60 from each girl every shift in exchange for letting them take to the pole.

Payout: A federal judge has awarded dancers from Rick's Cabaret in New York's Midtown $10.9 million

On Friday, Manhattan Federal Court Judge Paul Engelmayer published a 51-page ruling, slamming the club for misleading customers and depriving employees of their due salaries.

The action was brought on behalf of some 2,000 dancers employed at the club - owned by Peregrine Enterprises Inc, a unit of RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc - going back to 2005.

The award is short of the $18.8 million in damages the dancers sought, and the judge left the balance to be decided at a trial. 

The date will be set shortly, the court order said.

In a September 2013 ruling, Engelmayer sided with the plaintiffs, saying Rick's Cabaret exercised so much control over the dancers that they were actually employees subject to the club's rules and could not make independent decisions about their work.

The only payment the dancers received was in the form of tips for dances, which normally amounted to around $20.

Defending, the club said the strippers were obliged to pay 'performance fees'.

This included $20 per dance or semi-private performance, where they charge a minimum of $100 for 15 minutes and up to $400 for an hour.

However, Engelmayer slammed the defense, saying a 'reasonable customer would have understood the performance fees which customers paid dancers as gratuities belonging to particular dancers, not as service charges belonging to the club.'

RCI Hospitality, Rick's Cabaret's parent company, dismissed the ruling as 'flawed'.
