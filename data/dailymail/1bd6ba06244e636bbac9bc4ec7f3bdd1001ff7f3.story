Residents near a swanky midtown Manhattan hotel - where reality TV star Kim Kardashian lived with here husband of 72 days, Brooklyn Nets forward Kris Humphries - are outraged over late-night parties being thrown at the hotel's pool where women are often seen flashing their breasts to fellow partiers.

The pool on the roof of the Gansevoort Hotel on Park Avenue near 29th Street has become a summer weekend hot-spot for late-night, booze-infused parties that started off just being too loud for the neighbors but escalated into something that resembles a Girls Gone Wild video.

Because of all the noise and alleged indecent exposure, the 29th Street Neighborhood Association have demanded that the hotel's liquor license be revoked.

'They’re coming to the city to be wild. They don’t care who is living 
there,' Neighborhood Association chairman Mario Messina told CBS NY, 'It’s the wrong place and the wrong time to do something like 
that.'

Neighbors aren't the only people irked by the lewd parties - a British family recently posted a less-than-glowing review of their experience at the hotel, where rooms often start at $400 per night.

'The main problem we had was the swimming pool — pool bar and area — 
which was ridiculously over-crowded and pretty much unsuitable for 
children after lunchtime,' the family wrote.

Bad reviews: Some of the hotel's past guests have criticized the pricey inn, saying that the pool and bar area is extremely overcrowded and not suitable for families with children 

Neighbors' feud: Nearby residents have sent photos of the wild parties to the Liquor Authority in the hopes that the hotel's license allowing it to serve alcohol would be revoked

But it's not just the pool that has neighbors irked, the club downstairs also is host to wild, loud parties - like those often featured on the reality shows starring Kardashian, who lived in the hotel's penthouse with Humphries during their brief marriage. The penthouse suite often costs $7,000 per night, although it's unclear if that's the price the couple paid to call it home during their short marriage. 

'Sometimes in the middle of the night you hear a lot of screaming, like maybe drunk people,' said neighbor Josh Baran.

Residents have sent photos of the wild parties to the Liquor Authority, which says it will look into the matter.

The neighborhood association also says it has met with hotel management repeatedly, but that the hotel has not done enough to address their concerns.
