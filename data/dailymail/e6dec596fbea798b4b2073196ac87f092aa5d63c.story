With his perfectly tailored pinstripe suits, Reverend Al Sharpton does a good job of concealing the fact that he's millions of dollars in debt to the IRS.

Thanks to years of mismanaging personal and company funds, the prominent civil rights activist and his  businesses currently owe a staggering $4.5million in state and federal tax liens, the New York Times reports.

While Sharpton told the paper that he is up to date on payment plans for both debts, state officials told the paper that his state taxes have actually gone up $220,000 in recent years.

It was also revealed that his non-profit organization, National Action Network, was only able to continue operating for years because it stopped paying federal payroll taxes for a period. 

All the while, Sharpton has continued to fly first class and rake in a $250,000 salary from the non-profit.

Sharpton told the Times that his tax debts were not intentional, and that he is staying on top of payment plans. 

'You can say I’m not a great administrator,' he said. 'You can’t say that I’m not committed.'

When the story came out, he responded saying it was 'absolutely inaccurate'. 

'We have a signed agreement,' he told Fox News of his payment plan. 'And what is in the agreement has been kept. We’ve been up to date. This is the most bogus story in the world.'

Sharpton started off his career as a community organizer who became known as a somewhat controversial advocate in the black community, at one point supporting a black teen named Tawana Brawley who claimed a group of white men kidnapped and raped her. Those allegations ended up being false.

But more recently he has become a more mainstream figure, advising President Obama on race issues, hosting his own show on MSNBC, and acting as an advocate for the family of police-shooting victim Michael Brown.

His new image as a respected figure is now becoming marred by his shady financial past.

Sharpton's money problems trace back to 1993 when he pleaded guilty to failing to file his state income tax return. 

It was later discovered that Raw Talent, the company he filed his salary from National Action Network into, hadn't been paying taxes for years.  

In 1998, when he said he didn't have enough money to pay a $65,000 settlement for a defamation suit related to the Brawley case, Sharpton was forced to testify about his personal finances and admitted that he sometimes used money from his non-profit to pay for his daughters' private school tuition, though loans to officers are not allowed in such organizations. 

He also said that nearly all of his possessions, except a watch and ring,  were actually property of his other company Revals Communications.

Sharpton currently owes personal federal tax liens of more than $3million and state tax liens of $777,657, according to records. His for-profit companies, Raw Talent and Revals Communications, owe another $717,329 in state and federal tax liens. 

His non-profit has had similar issues. For years, the group failed to pay travel agencies, hotels and landlords while it footed the bill for Sharpton's numerous campaigns for public office.

Late on the rent check? Sharpton's former landlord also sued him twice for not paying rent at his apartment in this Brooklyn building. The first suit came in 2004 for $56,000. Another was filed in 2007 for $42,000 

Most of these debts have been taken up by Sharpton's rich supporters, but  for years it only managed to stay operational by skimping out on payroll taxes. 

Records show that the non-profit went from underpaying $90,000 in payroll taxes in 2003 to a whopping $1.9million in 2006. 

While Sharpton did forgo a salary from 2006-2008 and gave the non-profit a boost of funds with a $200,00 no-interest loan, he started taking his $250,000 salary again in 2009 when the organization was still $1.1million in dept to payroll taxes.

The U.S. Treasury's inspector general for tax administration recently wrote that such behavior in non-profit organization was 'abusive' and 'potentially criminal'.  

Sharpton also had financial issues on the personal front, and in 2004 was sued by his landlord and close friend Bishop E Bernard Jordan for not paying $56,000 in rent.

Jordan sued Sharpton again in 2007 for $42,000. It's unclear what happened to the suit, as neither have commented on it.

Last month, Sharpton held a huge bash for his 60th birthday, which doubled as a fundraiser for his organization. The event raised $1million which Sharpton pledged to put the money towards erasing his debt.
