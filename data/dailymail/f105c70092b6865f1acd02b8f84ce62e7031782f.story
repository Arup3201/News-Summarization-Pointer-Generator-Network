A father of four hit the road in Britain's first sports car after spending 12 years and £50,000 on lovingly restoring it to its former glory.

Alisdaire Lockhart, 67, painstakingly tracked down some of the last surviving original parts to rebuild the 100-year-old Vauxhall Prince Henry.

Mr Lockhart, from Selkirk in Scotland, then took an epic 620-mile trip through Sweden in the historic vehicle, following  the route of Vauxhall founder Percy Kidner’s Great Swedish Winter Reliability Trial of 1912.

One of a kind: The 67-year-old car enthusiast has just completed a four-day drive across Sweden in the vintage vehicle

The retired university administrator spent four days driving from Gothenburg to Stockholm and back home in the gleaming vintage car.

He said: ‘It was fantastic driving the car in 
Sweden, especially because I have spent so long renovating every single 
detail of it using original parts which are extremely rare.

‘It drives superbly so I am very pleased. It was a once in a lifetime journey.’

Mr Lockhart bought the car as a rusting shell in 1998 and began restoring in in his garage, hunting down spare parts made in 1911 and 1912 to make his prized possession look like new.

‘In total we covered 620 miles in 22 
hours of driving time spread over four days,’ said Mr Lockhart.

‘With 
the open roads and low  volume of traffic in Sweden, it was easy to 
cruise at 60mph without any mechanical trouble.

‘I love putting things to together and making them work. I have restored a few old Vauxhalls but this one was special because there are only five left in the world including mine – though mine is the only one with original parts.’

With a 21 horsepower, three-litre engine, the Vauxhall Prince Henry is thought to have been the first British-made car capable of reaching 100mph.

Mr Lockhart meticulously fixed every detail of the car to make it the only roadworthy model left in Britain.

He began work at his then home in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, before transporting his labour of love on the back of a trailer to his new home in Selkirk with his Scottish wife Patricia, 60, five years ago.

He finally finished the car earlier this year before taking it on its maiden marathon on May 21.

He completed the route and posed with the car in the exact same spot as Percy Kidner outside the former Standard Hotel in Norrkvping, Sweden.

He said: 'We drove along the southern route of the original event, through Jonkoping and Linkoping, arriving in Stockholm on the Tuesday or a reception where the car was photographed with the original trophies for the event.

'The car was then driven back to Gothenburg by the northern route for the return to the UK on May 27. It was the first British Sports car and it must have been very impressive in its heyday.'
