A Melbourne woman with a severe latex allergy who has been missing for a week has finally returned to her family.

Angelika Peters was last seen last seven days ago when she kissed her husband goodbye in their Ascot Vale home - in the Victorian capital's inner city - before he went to work.

Fortunately, Ms Peters returned to her family home at 4.30pm on Thursday. 

Melbourne mother-of-two, Angelika Peters, who has been forced to remain housebound for the past eight months after developing a severe latex allergy, had been missing for seven days

Her family had publicly appealed for information, fronting media two days ago, to help find her.

Every day the 45-year-old was missing, concerns for her welfare grew as she had left behind her wallet, phone and most importantly, her Epipen for her latex allergy which has developed so severely since the start of the year that she is under doctor's orders not to go out on her own for more than two hours at a time.

At the time, Ms Peters' daughter Arna Dionysopoulos said she was trying to stay positive despite fearing that she may never see her mother again.

Ms Peters' disappearance had her family completely baffled, struggling to make sense of her mother's mysterious disappearance. 

'I have absolutely no idea if she will return – I feel like I should say she will but I’m just not sure because it's been six days,' Ms Dionysopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 

'It’s absolutely terrifying not knowing if she’s alive or not – it’s hard to actually go there in my brain.' 

After working as a nurse for the past 25 years, Ms Peters was forced to give up her career when her latex allergy created too many risks for both herself and the patients.

Ms Peters had managed the allergy for at least 30 years until she became a relief nurse at the start of the year and began suffering anaphylactic reactions from too much exposure. 

A usually positive and upbeat woman, being housebound for the past eight months had started to take its toll on the former nurse. 

'It really did affect her because she loved being a nurse,' Ms Dionysopoulos said.

'Initially she was being proactive but it was just hard because she is very smart and didn’t have any stimulation which was a lot of the trouble so she tried to keep busy.'

'She might have had a bit of cabin fever because to stay alive she had to start taking really stringent care of her surroundings which was when things got harder because she had to stay away from large numbers of people.’

The family had been frantically searching for Ms Peters, including handing out flyers and visiting some of her favourite places.

Her husband Adam Gray also expressed great concern for his wife as she rarely left the house - let alone on her own.

'When I say she was at home – she was at home - she wouldn't leave the house without company,' he said. 

'She would always have her Epipen with her - unfortunately due to her personal habits she was at home all of the time.' 

Mr Gray said the condition had significantly impacted on his wife's everyday life - recently she had to leave a restaurant because a balloon had set off her allergy.
