A father-of-three who was wrongfully imprisoned for 23 years after being framed for murder by a rogue detective has reached a $6.4 million settlement with New York City.

David Ranta, 59, was freed last year after being jailed for the 1990 shooting of a Brooklyn rabbi.

On his release, he filed a $150 million claim that was settled before it even reached the city's legal department - a decision that apparently acknowledges the overwhelming evidence the city faced.

'While no amount of money could ever 
compensate David for the 23 years that were taken away from him, this 
settlement allows him the stability to continue to put his life back 
together,' Ranta’s lawyer, Pierre Sussman, said, the New York Times reported.

Heading home: Ahead of his release, a year-long investigation found that witnesses had lied in the case

'We are now focusing 
our efforts on pursuing an unjust conviction claim with the state of New
 York.'

Ranta, who had a heart
 attack one day after his release, 'would like everyone to 
know he is happy to have a chance at recovering his health, taking care 
of his heart and being there for his family and children', Sussman said.

Ranta has three children, including a daughter who was just a baby when he was locked away.

The
 case is the first expected to be brought against the city by former 
inmates who were convicted based on allegedly botched investigative work
 by Louis Scarcella.

The 
detective, who has denied any wrongdoing, is accused of making up 
confessions, leading witnesses and using informers who have since 
admitted lying for better sentencing deals.

Ranta was convicted of killing Hasidic rabbi and Holocaust survivor Chaskel Werzberger as he got inside his car just as a jewelry store was being robbed nearby.

Werzberger was shot in the head and the robber used his car as a getaway vehicle.

Ranta, who had previously had small 
run-ins with the law, was sentenced to 37 years to life in prison even 
though there was no physical evidence linking him to the scene.

Then-district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, fought off numerous appeals in the case, even when evidence pointed to another killer, Joseph Astin, who later died in a car crash.

Years after the conviction, a witness who was just 13 when he was brought before a line up said he was told to pick the man with 'the big noise'.

His revelation sparked an investigation by the district attorney’s Conviction Integrity Unit that ultimately led to Ranta's release.

Convicted: A witness, who was just 13 at the time, said that a detective told him to pick out the man 'with the big nose' from the line-up - and only Ranta (number 3) fitted that description

It uncovered two other witnesses also said they had lied after Scarcella offered them the chance to get out of jail if they provided information, the Times reported.

Questions: Retired detective Louis Scarcella was once celebrated for cracking murder cases

Ranta had also accused Scarcella, who has now retired, of making up his confession, which the detective claimed took place while the suspect was handcuffed at Central Booking.

It later emerged that Scarcella had gleaned six confessions from different inmates with the same words - 'You got it right. I was there' - and that he had used the same witness in different cases.

Prosecutors also learned that Scarcella had received an anonymous call saying Joseph Astin was responsible for the killing and questioned his wife - but dropped the lead when Astin died.

His wife even testified in 1996 that he had admitted the murder to her on the day but he died two months later. Efforts by Ranta's legal team to free him on the testimony failed.

Scarcella allegedly never submitted any paperwork showing that he had investigated Astin.

Authorities said around 50 of his cases would be reopened. He has since retired.

Of the settlement, Comptroller Scott M. Stringer said: 'This settlement is in the best interests of all parties and closes the door on a truly regrettable episode in our city’s history. I am pleased that my office was able to move quickly on this case.'

Ranta, who had filed the claim against the city two months after his release, is also expected to make a wrongful conviction claim against the state.
