Gareth Colfer-Williams was one of more than 1,200 infected by measles in the Swansea area

A young father who was not inoculated against measles as a child died from the disease during an epidemic in Swansea.

More than 1,200 people were infected by the virus in the South Wales outbreak.

The epidemic last November hospitalised more than 80 young people who had not had the vaccine at the height of the MMR scare.

An inquest at Swansea Coroners Court heard how Mr Williams died after he had complained of suffering from a rash on this body, fever and hallucinations, to doctors.

He had been advised by 
doctors to rest at home, take paracetamol and stop taking 
detoxification medicine he had started, in case he was reacting to it.

Mr Colfer-Williams was concerned about his four-year-old daughter Dakota and made sure she had the jab.

He was said to be vulnerable to infection as he had begun a detox two weeks before his death after suffering from alcohol problems.

Consultant pathologist Dr Maurizio Brotto said at 5ft 8in, Mr Colfer-Williams was 'very underweight' weighing just 7st 7lbs.

Mr Colfer-Williams' death in April came seven months after the outbreak of the disease last year.

A major vaccination programme was launched during the outbreak as parents were warned children could suffer anything from an eye disorder to deafness, brain damage, or death.

Mr Colfer-Williams was not inoculated against the disease as a child. He and his partner Cairo Oneim (pictured right) ensured their 4-year-old daughter Dakota was protected against infection

The 25-year-old died at his home in Swansea. He had been advised by doctors to rest at home, take paracetamol and stop taking his detoxification medicine in case he was reacting to it

Gareth Colfer-Williams was infected by measles and died from giant cell pneumonia

Speaking after the case Mr 
Colfer-Williams' mother Angela said her son's fiancee Cairo Oneim and 
daughter Dakota, were devastated by his death.

'He was a wonderful son and a wonderful father, uncle and brother. Cairo and Dakota are having a terrible time.'

Dr Brotto told the inquest Gareth was positive for measles and died from giant cell pneumonia caused by the disease.

He said: 'Measles is a viral infection which doesnâ€™t kill you but it can lead to giant cell pneumonia.'

The epidemic was contained at 
the end of last month after 95 per cent of children in Swansea and the
 surrounding areas received the vaccination.
