Ryan Zon a teenage footballer suffered a massive heart attack on the pitch in Sheffield - and was brought back to life by the team of medics he was playing against

A teenage footballer who almost died from a heart attack during a game was saved because he happened to be playing against a team of medics.

Ryan Zon, 19, was ‘effectively dead’ for ten minutes after collapsing in front of horrified spectators.

By extraordinary good fortune the opposition was made up of doctors who gave him cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) while an ambulance was called.

The drama has echoes of the incident last year involving Fabrice Muamba who was playing for Bolton when he suffered a cardiac arrest and his heart stopped beating for 78 minutes.

Muamba survived after a consultant cardiologist at the game as a fan helped to treat him on the pitch.

Ryan’s family say he would have died on the pitch if the footballing medics had not battled to revive him.

Tests revealed the heart attack was caused by one of his arteries growing the wrong way, which stopped the blood circulating.

Ryan, described by friends as a ‘keep-fit fanatic’, is stable in hospital but will need open heart surgery.

His mother Tracey, 47, said: ‘We owe everything to those doctors. Talk about being in the right place at the right time – Ryan will never be as lucky again.

‘We can’t thank them enough. Ryan has asked what would have happened if they’d not been there and I’ve told him we would have been burying him. It’s unbelievable to think how close we were to losing him.’

Ryan, from Aston in Sheffield, collapsed while playing as a winger for Swallownest Miners Welfare Reserves last weekend.

The match, at the city’s Norton playing fields, was against Sheffield Medics FC which consists of doctors and trainee medics.

When Ryan fell his team-mates thought it was a seizure but the medics instantly recognised it as a heart attack and took it in turns to give him CPR.

Two doctors playing rugby nearby joined in until the ambulance arrived.

The prognosis for Ryan is good although he will have to give up football. Muamba was also forced to retire.

It means Ryan will have to stop coaching disabled children with Rotherham United during the school holidays, which he did last summer.

Mrs Zon added: ‘He could have played football or cricket professionally, but he will never kick a ball again. I know he will struggle with that, but we just have to be thankful he is still alive.’

The family are calling for all football clubs to have defibrillators – which give the heart a potentially life-saving electric shock – on hand.

Ryan’s team manager Dixie Nightingale, 52, said: ‘People saw it live on TV when Fabrice Muamba had a heart attack – and to see it happen in front of your own eyes to one of your own players was shocking.’

Iain Ruddick, secretary of Sheffield Medics FC, added: ‘Everyone in the club is delighted there was a happy ending. Our players went into doctor mode and did the CPR taught from day one at medical school.’
