Scotland risks unprecedented austerity and the pound could ‘plunge into the abyss’ if the referendum results in a Yes vote, economic experts have warned.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research expressed dismay at Alex Salmond’s ‘Plan B’ if an independent Scotland is barred from using the pound.

The think-tank said the SNP leader’s back-up plan – adopting the pound informally and reneging on Scotland’s share of Britain’s borrowings – was ‘opportunistic’ and would saddle every taxpayer in the rest of the UK with an extra £5,900 of debt.

Chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander said a 'Yes' vote on Thursday would see Scotland's bonds downgraded to 'junk' status in the event of the country walking away from its share of the national debt 

It warned that defaulting on its debts would make Scotland an economic pariah, because it would be seen as too untrustworthy to borrow on the international money markets. This would lead to an ‘unprecedented degree of austerity and the eventual collapse in the currency regime’, it predicted.

Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said this scenario would see Scottish bonds – loans from international investors – downgraded to ‘junk’ status. This happens when it makes no sense for investors to lend money to a country because the risk of not getting it back is too high.

‘Junk status for Scottish bonds would condemn us all to higher interest rates and higher taxes to pay the inflated interest payments,’ Mr Alexander said.

‘That would consume vast amounts of money that could be spent on the NHS.’ He added: ‘The truth is that the entire economic case for separation is junk. Businesses, think-tanks, and international organisations all confirm the same thing – separation is risky, costly and bad for Scotland.’

Mr Alexander warned this would lead to higher interest rates resulting in higher taxes for everyone 

The warning was issued as one of the City’s most respected economists said an independence vote would see sterling ‘plunge into the abyss’.

Albert Edwards, of the French banking giant Societe Generale, said that if Scotland broke away, the chance of the rest of Britain leaving the EU would increase and this would cause international investors to pull their money out of the UK.

‘Capital will not be moving from north of the Scottish border to the south. It will be moving out of the UK altogether,’ Mr Edwards said.
