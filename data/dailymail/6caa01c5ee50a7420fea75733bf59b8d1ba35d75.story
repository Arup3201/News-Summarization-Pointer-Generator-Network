A New Year's driver and his passenger are lucky to be alive after a crash left their car leaning upwards against a tree.

The smashed up vehicle - believed to be a Renault Clio - ended up in a vertical position after hitting a lamppost at an accident blackspot in Leeds yesterday.

Astonishing photographs show how the car was left standing on its front bumper.

Lucky: Two men survived this New Year's Day crash which left a Renault Clio up a tree in Leeds

Blackspot: The vehicle hit a lamppost at the same spot where a young man was killed in 2007

And incredibly the two men survived the incident, which emergency services say could easily have killed them.

The crash happened at around 9.40am on Tuesday and two men in their twenties were cut from the car by fire crews and taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Police were forced to close the section 
of road in Leeds, West Yorkshire and Paul Smith, WatchÂ  Commander of 
Gipton Fire Station, said: 'The driver lost control and hit a lamppost and a tree, leaving the bumpers just touching the ground.'

Underneath the tree new tributes and flowers had been laid following a similar accident.

Phil Rayson was killed in exactly the same spot on New Year's Eve in 2007 after losing control of a Vauxhall Astra.
