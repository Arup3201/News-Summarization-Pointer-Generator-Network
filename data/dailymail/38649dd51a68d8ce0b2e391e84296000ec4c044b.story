A  judge refused to sentence a thief who stole heating oil from a village hall amid fears he would 'overreact' when sentencing him.

Robert Lee, 24, admitted siphoning off the oil from a small village hall and was expecting to be punished when he was brought before district judge Nigel Cadbury.

But Mr Cadbury told the hearing at 
Worcester Magistrates Court on Tuesday that his wife worked on a village 
hall committee and he sympathised with their cause which left him unable to issue a fair sentence.

Robert Lee admitted stealing heating oil from Peopleton Village Hall, Worcs on March 18

He said: 'My wife is on a small village hall committee. I feel very strongly about this sort of behaviour.

'Village halls struggle to survive and raise enough money to keep going.

'This sort of theft can put an end to a village hall's existence.

'If this happened in my village hall it would not surprise me if the village hall had to be closed down.

'I feel I would overreact and consider that he should undoubtedly go to prison for this.

'It would be wrong for me to sentence him. I may be seen to be biased."

The court heard Lee, from Gloucester, was caught stealing heating oil from Peopleton Village Hall, Worcs.

Prosecutor Kerry Lovegrove told the court police were called to the scene at 2am on March 18.

When they arrived they found a van with it's back doors open and fuel pumps and containers nearby.

Miss Lovegrove said: 'He stated that he had taken it, he would pay for it and put it back.

'The police have assisted in putting the fuel back in the tank to make sure that the village hall had fuel the next day.'

Lee was eventually handed a 12-month community order and ordered to undertake 150 hours of unpaid work after being transferred to another courtroom.

Chairman of the bench Chris Bull told Lee: "You were caught red-handed. This was a planned act that targeted a village that is not on the way to anywhere.

'You will be aware that this is a prevalent offence in this county and in rural areas.'

Lee was ordered to pay £83 costs and a victim surcharge of £60.

He was also ordered to pay the village hall £525.65 for the fuel, which may have been contaminated, and £48.58 for damage he caused.
