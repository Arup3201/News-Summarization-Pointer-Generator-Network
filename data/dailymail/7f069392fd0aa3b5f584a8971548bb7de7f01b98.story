He may have a reputation as one of the scariest men in football, but Roy Keane showed he had a somewhat softer side following the hug he received from Aston Villa's mascot on Saturday.

The former Manchester United captain has taken a position alongside Paul Lambert in the Villa Park dugout, and was embraced by Bella the Lion during his first appearance on the touchline.

And despite his hardman reputation, Keane couldn't help himself but to crack into something of a smile.

Back in the big time: Keane has returned to the dugout under Paul Lambert at Aston Villa

In their first appearance at home in pre-season, the Irishman oversaw his team drawing 0-0 with Italian club Parma.

Keane's assistant role at Villa has marked his return to the Premier League following a six-year absence since he quit his managerial post at Sunderland in 2008.

He will combine the post with his other job as the assistant under Martin O'Neill for the Republic of Ireland national team.
