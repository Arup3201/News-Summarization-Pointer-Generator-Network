Bull the cat has found himself homeless... for having the wrong sort of furry friends.

In a bizarre saga which has gripped the town of Lafia, in Nigeria, the seven-year-old feline has been abandoned by his owner for being gay.

The middle-aged woman claims that he has engaged in 'unnatural sexual behaviour', making advances towards other male cats in the house while shunning the females in the area.

In further damning evidence, neighbours told Leadership that none of the other cats born while Bull was in the house had his colouring.

They claim that this is because he is not doing his heterosexual best to continue the species.

Bull’s owner, who has not been named, claims his actions are a ‘a contradiction of the laws of nature’ and has kicked him out of her house, saying ‘anybody interested in this gay cat can have it because I have no further use of it.’

As yet, no one has adopted the cat, but many residents of the area have been thronging to the house to see the spectacle, and have been cracking jokes about the incident.

While Bull may be the first cat to be publically declared gay and disowned by his owner, he is not the first pet.

In 2013, a Tennessee man sent his dog to an animal shelter to be put down after he suspected it of being gay.

The dog found a new and more sympathetic owner just hours before he was to be destroyed.
