David Ivin, 36, died after being pinned to the ground following a incident with bouncers at his work's Christmas party

A salesman died when his heart and lungs stopped working after he was allegedly pinned to the ground with so much force outside a Christmas party.

David Ivin, who worked for Saga left the company Christmas party at Leas Cliffe Hall in Folkestone, Kent to go outside for a cigarette, only to be turned away by security staff when he tried to return.

The 36-year-old continued to try to gain entry to the venue but was allegedly pushed in the chest by bouncer Martin Barnwell and nearly fell down some stairs, Canterbury Crown Court heard.

The court was also told that security staff, Martin Barnwell, 30, and Brent Wright, 36, forced him to the floor and administered a dangerous choke hold.

It also heard that there was no natural cause for his heart and lungs to stop operating properly and the restraint of Mr Ivin was 'unnecessary' and 'excessive'.

The incident happened on December 13, 2012 and the prosecution say Barnwell and colleague Wright took hold of Mr Ivin's arms and dragged him outside when he tried to re-enter the building.

Duncan Atkinson, prosecuting, said there was an angry confrontation and both men, who are now on trial, ended up on top of Mr Ivin.

He told the jury yesterday: 'There was no natural cause for his heart and lungs to cease operating properly.

'We say the restraint of Mr Ivin was unnecessary and the manner and duration was excessive and contrary to proper training and techniques.

'It posed an obvious and serious risk to Mr Ivin's health.

'What Mr Ivin's intoxication cannot do is absolve the defendants of responsibility or permit them to have acted in any way they chose towards him.

'Unsurprisingly, door security staff are trained that those who are intoxicated can be more aggressive and it stresses the need to behave calmly and professionally.

'During the confrontation, Mr Ivin was restrained by Barnwell and Wright, both of whom held him on the floor.

'Wright jumped on Mr Ivin's back to force him to the floor and then administered a dangerous neck or choke hold.

'The duration of the restraint by both of them was both considerable and excessive.' A post mortem revealed that small burst blood vessels in Mr Ivin's eye were caused by 'sustained pressure for at least 20 to 30 seconds'.

This was said to prevent normal blood flow and caused an irregular heartbeat pattern.

Mr Atkinson added: 'It is clear these two men owed Mr Ivin a duty of care.

'They were responsible for maintaining security at the hall where he was a guest.

'This was gross negligence. The post mortem showed that Wright's hold had been used too long and with too much force, causing significant damage to the neck.'

The door supervisors worked for 219 Security who had been recruited to provide the security at the party.

Wright, from Folkestone, Kent, and Barnwell from Dover, Kent, both deny manslaughter.

The trial continues.
