For a team who only narrowly missed out on the Premier League title last May and spent more than £100million on new players in the summer, sitting 11th in the table after 11 games of the season is simply unacceptable.

That's the situation facing Liverpool and manager Brendan Rodgers after a 2-1 defeat against Chelsea on Saturday - already their fifth loss of the campaign - left the Reds in the bottom half below Everton and Manchester United.

But far more concerning than sitting underneath their great rivals is the gap between themselves and league leaders Chelsea. Victory for Jose Mourinho's men at Anfield took them 15 points clear of Steven Gerrard and Co and the gap looks certain to increase.

Games played (all competitions): 17

Wins: 7 (One on penalties)

Draws: 2

Defeats: 8 

Goals conceded: 24 

Goals scored: 20 

At the same stage last season, Rodgers had led his side to second place in the table, had beaten David Moyes' United side and had seven wins. 

But having already lost to the likes of Newcastle and West Ham this time around, Liverpool are nine points off the pace they set last term.

Perhaps even more worrying for fans of a red persuasion is an unwelcome comparison to Roy Hodgson's unsuccessful spell as boss during the 2010-11 season.

After working wonders at Fulham, Hodgson arrived to oversee an Anfield revolution but ended up being sacked just over six months into his three-year contract.

Despite his failings - both in the transfer market and on the pitch - the ex-Inter Milan manager actually managed to accumulate more points after 11 fixtures than Rodgers has now.

Hodgson masterminded a 2-0 win over Chelsea and respectable 1-1 draw with Arsenal during Liverpool's start to the 2010-11 campaign, earning 15 points, leaving them in ninth spot in the table.

Liverpool had a better record under Roy Hodgson in the 2010-11 season than they do under Rodgers this term

But having failed to win any of their last three top-flight clashes, Rodgers' side have only 14 points and are below West Ham, Stoke, Swansea and high-flying Southampton.

They haven't fared much better in Europe either, having made their return to Champions League action following a five-year absence brought about by below-par performances in the Premier League.

Two defeats by Real Madrid - the second of which came at the Bernabeu after Rodgers decided to rest seven first-team players - and another away at Basle means Liverpool have now lost eight games in all competitions this season - the same amount as in the whole 2013-14 season (43 games).

Their soft defence and lacklustre attack has left their hopes of reaching the knockout stages hanging by a thread, with wins against the Swiss side and Bulgarians Ludogorets almost certainly required if they're to reach the last 16.

As well as needing his back four to tighten-up considerably, Rodgers also needs his attack to become more potent - and fast - if Liverpool are to turn around their nightmare start.

The Reds have scored just three goals in their last six games in all competitions, with Emre Can's strike against Chelsea coming courtesy of a hefty deflection. They failed to find the back of the net in four of those games.

The sale of last season's top-scorer Luis Suarez to Barcelona has undoubtedly had a huge impact on the Liverpool's ability to unlock opposition defences, while two injuries to Daniel Sturridge has left summer signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert toiling up front.

Sturridge is set to return against Crystal Palace after the international break as Rodgers' men aim to gain a measure of revenge on the Eagles following their capitulation at Selhurst Park at the end of last season.

Fail to take three points in south London and Rodgers' record this season will be even worse than Hodgson's was four years ago. Time will tell if the same fate befalls him.
