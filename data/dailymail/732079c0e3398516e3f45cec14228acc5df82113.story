When Sianagh Gallagher was born 10 weeks premature, doctors told her mother to prepare herself for the worst.

The tot had a string of complications including just one arm, no collarbone, a curved spine, twisted pelvis, dislocated knee and both feet facing the wrong way.

But despite the early setback, Sianagh has beaten all the odds to become the first one-armed person to join Team GB's paraclimbing team.

High achiever: Teenager Sianagh Gallagher is the first person to be picked for Team GB's paralympic rock climbing team

Still only 16, she is now ranked fourth of all paraclimbers in the whole of Europe and is the only person to be climbing with just one arm, and regularly scales the dizzying heights of 100ft - the equivalent of a 10-storey building.

In May was picked to be part of Team 
GB's paraclimbing team in May competing in teams with people who 
have mental and physical disabilities.

And last month she competed her first competition against the world's best paraclimbers in Chamonix, France.

Sianagh
said: 'I keep forgetting that I'm part of Team GB, because I didn't think it would happen.

Fighter: Doctors warned Sianagh's mother to prepare herself for the worst when her determined daughter was born 10 weeks premature

'I really don't think of myself as an inspiration because I do 
stuff and get on with it but it makes me really happy people think that.

'I started at the age of 10 as my primary school had a climbing club starting, so I put my name down.

'I didn't think I could do it, but the first time I did it I managed to get to the top.

'I've improved quite a bit over the past few years because it's become serious, so I've started training about five days a week.'

She added: 'I'd like to come first in world championships next year, and I'd
just like to carry on competing, really. I'm hoping to make it to the 
Paralympics eventually.

'My mum is so important to me, if it wasn't for her I wouldn't have made it to any competitions and got to where I am now.'

Learning the ropes: Sianagh is given some mentoring by her trainer Jonathan Richardson

Hanging in there: Sianagh refused to let her disability get in the way of enjoying life and took up the extreme sport of rock climbing when she was just 10

Although doctor's had told her mother, Jade, to prepare herself for the worst when Sianagh was born after just 30 weeks, she refused to give up on her baby and believed deep down the tot would survive.

When she reached the age of 10 she started climbing, and has proved to be an
inspiration to everyone she has encountered by not allowing her 
disability to get in the way.

Mrs Gallagher, 38, said: 'She's never let things bother her, and I think that's because we never wrapped her up in cotton wool while she was little.

'I never stepped in and helped her to tie her shoelaces, because I knew that in some point in her life she would have to do it for herself.

'From a really young age she always wanted to be independent.

Modest: Sianagh says she does not see herself as an 'inspiration' although the moniker does make her happy

'Her disability has never been an issue - she was riding a bike at the same age as everyone else, though she used to go round in circles at first.'

Sianagh is keen to keep a healthy lifestyle to keep herself in top shape, even turning down junk food and takeaways that most teenagers love.

Mrs Gallagher said: 'We have a multigym in the front room, and the whole house has been adapted into a training ground.

'We do have a takeaway from time to time, but she will say to me "You do know that's a heart attack in a box, don't you Mum?"'

Sianagh has not found it easy to get funding for her practices and competitions and relies a lot on donations from her JustGiving page to help her fund her dream.
