A British candle-maker has created the ultimate homage to her local football club, Newcastle United: a handmade scented candle that smells just like their playing pitch at St James' Park.

Ruth Herling, artist and founder of Candela Candles, intended to create a product that would give off the smell of freshly-mown playing field grass.

The 39-year-old from Gosforth, Northumberland, has named it The Geordie and hopes it will remind Northerners who have fled their hometown of the city's best bits.

The Geordie Candle is black and white and has a fresh and dewy fragrance. The candle is already so popular it is one of her fastest-sellers, Herling told Sky.

The black and white candle with the smell of newly mown turf has become so popular it is among the fastest-selling of her range of luxury candles.

Describing the £9.95 candle - which is 'dedicated to Geordie Land' - the company says: 'Pure vegetable wax, combined with an exclusive blend of exquisite fragrances to create a luxuriously perfumed, scented candle.

'This handmade scented candle will burn for some 30 hours, diffusing a crisp and fresh fragrance , dedicated to the heart of Geordie Land and fresh cut pitch of St James' Park.

'Our Geordie scented candle is a wonderfully fresh and uplifting blend and is one of the our popular fragrances dedicated to Geordie Land.'

The Candela range of candles, which include The Geordie, Spring Delight, Jasmine, English Garden and Bouquet

Speaking to Sky, Herling said: 'Fragrances can be very powerfully evocative, and can unlock memories and emotions we may long have forgotten about.

'I'd hope the scent of fresh grass when combined with the distinctive black-and-white design of the label will help transport people to a place which means a great deal to them.'

Candela differs from many other candle ranges because they are all made using vegetable wax, not beeswax, and are vegan-friendly and toxin-free.

Alongside The Geordie, the range offers 14 other fragrances.
