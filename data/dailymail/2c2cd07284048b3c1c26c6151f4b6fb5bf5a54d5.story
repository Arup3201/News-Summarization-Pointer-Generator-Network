Barcelona have announced a new global commercial partnership with Beko and have placed a corporate logo onto the sleeve of their kits.

The home appliance company Beko has secured the rights to feature their design on the sleeve of both the team’s jersey and the club’s training kit, as Barcelona demonstrate their full immersion into the corporate world.

Barcelona have traditionally been resistant to excessive commercialism, refusing to follow the lead of their global rivals and until 2006, they remained steadfast in their determination not to have a sponsor on their shirt.

However, they finally relented and allowed the children’s charity UNICEF to occupy centre stage on their famous blaugrana shirt, before the Qatar Foundation, another charity, took pride of place from 2010.

However, in 2013 many fans were left disappointed when the club made the step away from 112 years of history to allow Qatar Airways to emblazon their name across the scarlet and blue jersey in a five year sponsorship agreement.

Now, Barca have not one but two sponsors on their shirt.

The club are also further exploring the potential of the Catalan brand, with Beko becoming a global sponsor for the next four years.

A statement read: ‘FC Barcelona and Beko announced today the signing of a new agreement which will see the global home appliance group become the club’s worldwide sponsorship partner for the next four years. The deal will see Beko’s new logo, also unveiled today, featured on the sleeve of the new team jersey and training kit – a first for any commercial brand.

‘Beko will become the first commercial brand to benefit from a permanent presence on the official team jersey’s sleeve.’

The press release added: ‘The partnership will be symbolised by the presence of the Beko logo on the arm of the first team shirt worn for all Spanish League and Cup games during the 2014/15 season, as well as for friendlies and summer tour games.’

As only two logos – one commercial and one not– for-profit – are allowed on team jerseys in the Champions League, Beko’s logo will not be seen in European competition.
