A woman cleared of causing her own sister's death in a road crash has revealed her agony at being involved in the accident that robbed her of her 'best friend' - and that it will always haunt her.

Rosie-Ann Stone, 21, was cleared by a jury on Friday of causing the death of her elder sister Jennie, 28, by careless driving.

But, speaking after the case, she revealed that the nightmarish incident will 'follow me for the rest of my life'.

In a heartbreaking twist, Rosie-Ann also told how her sister's ten-year-old son had wished a prison sentence on the other driver - but immediately forgave her when he realised she had been behind the wheel.

Ms Stone and her sister had both been trying to overtake a lorry on the A165 near Hull, Yorkshire.

Rosie-Ann pulled out first on the single-carriageway road to overtake the vehicle, but her sister, who was three cars behind, pulled out as well and tried to pass both of them at once.

After colliding with Rosie-Ann's car, Jennie's Peugeot crashed into a tree, and she was killed by the impact.

New loss: The family were already grieving for Gregg Stone, who was killed in Afghanistan, when Jennie's car crashed

Reflecting on the loss of her sister, Rosie-Ann told the Sunday Mirror: 'We were closer than sisters. Jennie was my best friend, my therapist, my agony aunt, my personal stylist, my advisor. She was my wing man, my drinking buddy and my go-to for -everything and anything.'

'Regardless of the verdict, I’ll always feel terrible to have been involved in an accident in which my sister died. It will follow me for the rest of my life.'

At the time of the incident, 18 February 2013, the Stone family was still reeling from the death of Rosie and Jennie's brother Gregg, a soldier who was killed in Afghanistan aged 20.

Gregg was shot on a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman who had been captured by the Taliban.

He had died just eight months before the family was struck with another tragedy.

It took a jury at Hull Crown Court just three hours to clear Rosie-Ann of the charge, at the end of a five-day trial.

Speaking immediately after the trial, Rosie-Ann said that she was prepared for a nine-month prison sentence - but that what she most feared was being told that she was responsible for the death.

She said: ‘If I was found guilty, that would have meant Jennie’s death had been my fault. I would not have been able to live with myself.

‘I was visualising her as she was when we were growing up together. I was thinking how she looked. How she smelt. Everything about her.

‘During the trial, I looked at the jury – every one of them. I felt sorry for them. Some of them looked at me sympathetically. Some looked at me sternly.

‘I had no idea what they were thinking.’

But she said that as she left court a juror told her: ‘We all believed you. Live your life. Be happy.’

The controversial case also saw the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) criticised for bringing the case to court in the first place.

Following the verdict, Judge Judge Simon Jack told the jury: 'Before the start of the case I expressed concern with the Crown Prosecution Service that it was not in the public interest to have a trial.

‘The CPS was consistently saying that it was. It was their decision not mine.'

The family had begged the Service not to bring the charges, saying it would be completely against the wishes of Jennie. The case is estimated to have cost £100,000 of public money.

But, in a remarkable show of forgiveness, Rosie-Ann also revealed how she was comforted by her nephew, Jennie's ten-year-old son, as soon as he found out that she had been driving one of the cars in the accident.

Rosie-Ann recalled a conversation with the grieving boy just days after his mother had died, when he said that he hoped whoever was driving the other car would be sent to jail.

He did not know at that point that she was the other driver, and Rosie-Ann was forced to hide to conceal her tears. But the boy had a striking change of heart when he found out his aunt was involved.

She said: 'Mum sat him down and said "you know auntie Rosie was the other driver?" He said he didn’t want me to go to jail and came and hugged me. He’s such a lovely little boy.'

Support: Rosie-Anne and Liam arrive at Hull Crown Court

In another bizarre twist in the story of the Stone family, the stalwart boyfriend who helped Rosie-Ann through her court ordeal is a soldier who served with her dead brother.

Liam Fisher, 21, served with Gregg Stone in Afghanistan, and was deployed on alongside him on a mission to rescue a kidnapped Afghan policeman.

Gregg was fatally shot during the mission - but, heroically, after the first bullet hit, Liam put himself between his comrade and the line of fire to stop him being hit twice.

Rosie-Ann revealed how the two met after Gregg died, and the experience meant that he was able to help her cope with Jennie's death as well.

Liam was pictured accompanying Rosie-Ann to court in the past week.
