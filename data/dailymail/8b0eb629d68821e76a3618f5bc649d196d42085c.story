Victim: Two months before her death, Jessie Cavett, pictured, was seeking a divorce from her husband and also filed a restraining order

Two months before her death, Jessie Cavett was looking to divorce from her husband and also filed a restraining order, the newspaper reported.

Defense attorney Gordon Mallon said in court that the shooting happened following the rejection of his client's visitation request to see his daughter, according to The Oregonian.

Mallon also reportedly cited drug use and paranoia - the latter of which he claimed was a byproduct of a brain injury from a beating meant to induct him into a motorcycle club - as other factors in the slaying.

MailOnline earlier reported that Cavett belonged to The Gypsy Jokers, which do not allow African-Americans into the club. 

According to KATU, Cavett admitted to the murder of his wife Jessie Cavett last October, which took place right in front of two girls.

He was apprehended by police 10 hours after taking off and bringing one of the girls - his daughter -along with him, the news outlet reported.

Cavett described the murder as an impulse as opposed to domestic violence on Monday, according to the affiliate station. 

'I am so sincerely sorry for this tragic incident that has hurt so many 13 months ago,' he reportedly said while reading the contents of a note out loud. 'The biggest victims in all this are four beautiful children who've lost a mother forever and a father in prison for life.'

Meanwhile, Jessie Cavett's sister as well as her parents addressed Cavett, KATU reported.

'She's doesn't have to be scared anymore, and forever Jessie's going to have a voice, being a voice for the victims of domestic violence so that there aren't any more cases like this if we can help it,' Jennie Cochran, the sister of Jessie Cavett, reportedly said.

'She cries for mommy every night,' Brian Kinney also reportedly said of his daughter with Cavett, named Peyton, according to KATU.
