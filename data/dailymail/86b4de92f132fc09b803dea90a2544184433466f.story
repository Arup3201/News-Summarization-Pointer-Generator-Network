A baby dramatically born on the bathroom floor of a Florida McDonald's restaurant on Monday is set to be known as 'Ronald', according to family.

Heroic McDonald's staff assisted in the birth while a concerned 911 operator gave instructions over a mobile telephone as it became known the newborn was neither breathing nor moving.

Paramedics arrived on the scene just as the baby boy took its first breath after the cool 911 dispatcher instructed the McDonald's staff to rub the baby's back.

The baby's mother, 20-year-old Shardonnay Hill, had stopped at the Lake Wales restaurant, between Orlando and Tampa, on Monday morning on her way to a doctor's check-up with her grandmother.

But no one quite knew just what would happen as first-time mother Hill served up her own rush order in the popular fast food restaurant.

'I stopped to get a cup of coffee (and) she stopped to use the bathroom,' Barbara Albert, the woman's grandmother, told BayNews9.

Albert said her granddaughter, sensing something was up with her soon-to-be-born baby, pleaded with staff: 'Go and get something.'

Employees quickly responded to calls for help and placed cardboard boxes on the bathroom floor for the laboring mother to lie on.

'She can't have the baby over the toilet,' a McDonald's worker suggested, according to Albert.

The McDonald's employees, identified as shift manager Catherine Page, Phylis Tirado, and Jessica Robtouch, swung into action.

'I have three boys but have never done anything like that before,' said Tirado, according to local blog The Daily Ridge.

Albert said her granddaughter was just six months pregnant and the baby was born five minutes into the 911 call with the Polk County dispatcher.

The baby was still in its amniotic sac when it was delivered and was not breathing, according to a recording of the call.

Caller: 'The baby's out.'

911: 'The baby's completely out of her, still in the sack?'

Caller: 'Should we bust it?'

911: 'Yes, go ahead and bust the sack.'

Caller: 'Oh, the little baby's moving. There he is.'

911: 'Is the baby crying or moving?'

Caller: 'Not yet.'

'The paramedics finally gotten there,' said Albert. 'At that time, I seen the baby changing color.'

The baby's aunt said that considering the boy had been born in his mother's favorite restaurant he would be known as 'Ronald'.

'That's her favorite restaurant and we need to call him Ronald,' said Vanessa Richardson. 'That's what we need to call him. His nickname is going to be Ronald McDonald.'

Albert, now a great-grandmother, said 
the baby's name on the birth certificate would be 'Joshua Murray'.

'I 
just hope and pray that the baby will be okay,' said Albert. 'She's a 
young mother, it's her first pregnancy, first baby. So she's upset.'

Albert said the baby was transported from the restaurant at 416 West Central Avenue in Lake Wales to Heart of Florida Regional Medical Center in Davenport and was later airlifted to All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg.

'We wish the baby well and hope mom will bring him back to see all of us,' said the restaurant's assistant manager, Karen Davis.
