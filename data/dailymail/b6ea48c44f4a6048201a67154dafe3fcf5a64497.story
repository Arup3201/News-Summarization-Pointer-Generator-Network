Two binmen have been sacked after being caught on camera sleeping on the job - just a few hours into their shift.

The pair were spotted catching 40 winks in their cab while out on their rounds in Aston, Birmingham, at 9.30am.

The pictures, which were taken by a passing businessman visiting the area, show one Birmingham City Council worker slumped at the driver seat with his hefty boots on the dashboard.

His co-worker is pictured in the 
passenger seat, eyes tightly closed and with his head resting against 
the back rest next to a half-open window.

Now the sleepy pair, who were employed by an outside agency, have now been told their services are no longer required.

The photographer said: ‘Is this really what council employees get up to so early in the morning?’

The photos were taken at 9.30 in the morning, just three and a half hours into the average binman’s shift. And the incident has caused added outrage because some local residents had been complaining their bins had gone uncollected.

Council bosses took swift action after they were sent the pictures.

They identified the two as employed by an outside agency, but refused to disclose which agency the men worked for.

Robert Oxley, from campaign group Taxpayers’ Alliance, said the workers found napping on the job should ‘rightly face the sack’.

He said: ‘Residents hand over their council tax so that their bins are emptied, not for staff to catch 40 winks in the cab.

‘The city council must demand value for taxpayers’ money and transparency when they outsource a service.

‘Firms
who fail to provide staff that are up to scratch should be consigned to
the rubbish heap just like the bins they were supposed to be 
collecting.’

Two years ago 
the council controversially moved from a task and finish system where 
binmen could knock off if they completed their designated round early 
to one where they work a full daily shift.

But now it appears that instead of knocking early some staff prefer to take their downtime in the middle of their shift.

The pair also attracted criticism from one city councillor, who said members of the public were ‘paying the price for public sector cuts’.

Waseem Zaffar, Labour councillor for the Lozells and East Handsworth Ward, said: ‘I’ve had calls from people in my ward to say their bins haven’t been collected, and even my own bins were collected a day late.

‘When you hear of people sleeping on the job, is makes you think is it any wonder we have a backlog.

'They may have been sleeping because they had a busy shift, which shows that having agency staff instead of permanent staff isn’t the answer.’

A Birmingham City Council spokesman said: ‘The people photographed were agency workers and we have told the agency that their services are no longer required. We have made a complaint to them about this.’
