Incredible pictures show the dramatic moment rescuers met a deputy sheriff off who spent 45-minutes bravely battling choppy seas to keep a teenage surfer's head above water and pulled the two to safety.

Deputy Terry Brown kept the 14-year-old boy identified only as Joshua afloat off Southern Oregon's coast after he got caught in a rip current on Monday and the two are now recovering from hypothermia at Sutter Coast Hospital.

The teen was in only around three-feet of water at Harris Beach, north of Brookings when he got pulled out by the current and was kept alive for nearly an hour by Brown until help arrived.

Brown was among the first responding to the 911 call from the panicked boys family and he immediately stripped to his uniform pants and T-shirt, put on an orange life vest and went after the boy.

When he got to him, Bishop said Tuesday, the deputy had to let go of the rope he'd brought along so that he could keep the teenager from going under.

'Brown swam out to the boy, grabbed a hold of him and kept him afloat,' Ward said. 'They were not able to make it back in. He tried to calm the boy, telling him, 'Hey, we got help on the way.' said Curry County Sheriff Lt. John Ward to Oregon.Live.

The deputy and the teenager were 100 to 200 yards offshore as the surf churned, swirling the two in a large circle and defeating attempts by vessels - from a kayak to a Coast Guard boat - to reach them or get ropes to them.

'They were getting pulled underwater,' Ward said. 'Either the rope was disconnected or it came undone. The deputy was in pretty bad shape by that time. They had been in the water probably 30-35 minutes,' said Ward.

Eventually, a rescue swimmer was able to tie ropes to them so they could be pulled ashore.

Both were hypothermic, Bishop said, but Brown was in worse shape.

'He was within minutes,' said Bishop.

'If he had been in the water 5 or 10 minutes more, we would have lost him.'

The deputy may be kept in the hospital a few more days so his lungs can be monitored for salt water damage, Bishop said.

'Deputy Brown is doing well,' Ward said Tuesday. 'He is still in the hospital. He has fluid on his lungs, but they got his core temperature back up and he will have a full recovery.'
