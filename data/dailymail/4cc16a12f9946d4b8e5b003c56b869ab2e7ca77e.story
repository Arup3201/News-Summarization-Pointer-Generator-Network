Since moving from Salisbury to the Loire Valley, France, in October 2010, Mr Elliott often returns to photograph different corners of Britain.

He said: 'My interest in landscape photography grew from wanting to be in the outdoors, rather than stuck behind a desk in an office.

'Before going to work in the mornings, I would often visit the water meadows overlooking Salisbury Cathedral and capture what I could.

'I love seeing the mountainous areas of the UK, like the Lake District, especially the western lakes around the Wasdale area. Scotland is also becoming a big draw for me - I love the diversity of the country.'

The beautiful pictures capture both the untouched beauty of the nation's sweeping landscapes and the charm and character of rural towns and villages.

Mr Elliot explained that taking a photograph can be a completely spur of the moment decision or it can take extensive planning.

He added: 'Sometimes you can be waiting for hours or in some cases it requires thorough planning, when you’re waiting for a particular month for the sun to be in the right position.

'Capturing a scene really comes down to experience and getting out there as much as possible.

'The more you do this, the better you will become, you will really get a feel of when you should click the shutter.

'I get a really good reaction from people when they see the photographs, which is great.'
