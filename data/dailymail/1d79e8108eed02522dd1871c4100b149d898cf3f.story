Smiling along with her fellow contestants, Charlotte Giles looks picture perfect as she celebrates being crowned the new Miss Hampshire.

But cheers turned to jeers and a row erupted shortly afterwards when it emerged 23-year-old Miss Giles is actually from Twickenham, in Middlesex.

Fellow contestant Michaela Cater, 19, even lodged a complaint against her, but the victory will stand because Miss Giles lives within 50 miles of the Hamshire border.

Charlotte Giles, 23, has been crowned Miss Hampshire, but a row has broken out after it emerged she is actually from neighboring Middlesex

Despite smiling alongside Miss Giles (centre), fellow contestant Michaela Cater (third from right) lodged a complaint against her, calling the win 'silly'

However, furious Cater is calling for the rule to be scrapped.

She said: 'It doesn’t add up and it just seems a bit silly. I would not enter Miss Dorset because I don’t live there.

'How can she go to Miss England when she’s got a Miss Hampshire title but is from Middlesex?

'The locals know the contestants and they’re going to be like "hold on, who is she? Has she done anything for our community?"'

But Miss Giles today defended herself saying there was not a beauty pageant in her home county of Middlesex, as it is technically an historic county and is now mostly part of Greater London with sections in Berkshire, Hertfordshire and Surrey.

She said: 'At the time, I wasn’t aware that anybody had a problem with me being from another county.

'Everyone at the event in Hampshire was really welcoming and made me feel very comfortable - especially when I was crowned the winner.

'There was no beauty pageant contest in Middlesex and because Hampshire is nearby and I have friends living there, I decided to enter.

Under competition rules anyone from within 50 miles of the Hampshire border can compete. Miss Cater (left), named 'Miss Popularity' is calling for the rule to be scrapped and the tiara to be taken away from Miss Giles

'It’s a shame that someone has reacted this way, but it’s not going to stop me, it’s all for Miss England.

'I don’t see what the problem is, it is quicker for me to get to Alton than some of the other girls driving from parts of Hampshire.

'I’m not sure the reaction is down to jealously but I can see where they are coming from.'

Miss Cater is from Hythe, near Southampton, which is almost exactly the same distance from Alton as Twickenham, home to Miss Giles.

Paula Langley, from Alton, who organises the beauty pageant each year, defended the decision to award Charlotte the Miss Hampshire title.

The 43-year-old said: 'I have only had one complaint about Charlotte winning this year’s beauty pageant.

'None of the other girls have taken an exception to the geography of where Charlotte lives, apart from Michaela.

'But what else was Charlotte supposed to do? Not enter at all? It is not her fault her home county was not hosting a Miss England heat.

Miss Giles has defended the win, saying there was no Middlesex competition, so she joined one nearby

'If she didn’t apply for Miss Hampshire she would have been denied the opportunity to chase her dream - which wouldn’t have been fair.

'What people forget is that the regional heats are for Miss England - which is a national competition.

'It would have been wrong to deny Charlotte the opportunity.'

Ms Langley, who runs production company Abbeyfield Films, compared the situation to the hit TV show The X Factor.

She added: 'When people audition for The X Factor in Manchester, Cardiff and other cities, they don’t have to live there.

'Miss Hampshire is a stepping stone for talented young women to use to pursue their dream of winning Miss England and potentially Miss World.

'Charlotte lives in Twickenham, it would take her less time to get to Alton, where the final was held, than people who live in parts of the county.

'Obviously there are going to be girls who complain and get upset - you can’t please everyone.'

Charlotte will now take part in the Miss England competition in Torquay, Devon, in June.
