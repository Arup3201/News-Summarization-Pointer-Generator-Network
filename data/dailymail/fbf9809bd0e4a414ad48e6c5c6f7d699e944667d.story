Birmingham and Middlesbrough have made enquiries about taking Graham Dorrans on loan from West Bromwich Albion.

The 27-year-old Scotland international will be allowed to leave by Tony Pulis for the right offer as he looks to strengthen elsewhere in his squad.

Dorrans has made 21 appearance in all competitions for the Baggies this season, scoring once.

Fulham and Burnley have also asked about Dorrans's situation but Albion will only consider a permanent deal as they look to finance incomings.

Callum McManaman is due to have a medical on Wednesday ahead of joining from Wigan while Pulis has also asked Alex McLeish about Genk midfielder Kara Mbodj but Albion's priority is to bring in another central striker before the window closes. 

The 25-year-old Senegal international can play centre-back and midfield. 

West Bromwich Albion have asked about Genk midfielder Kara Mbodj in a proposed £5million transfer
