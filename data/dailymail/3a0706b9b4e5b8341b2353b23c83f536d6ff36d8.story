Google Maps now offers live updates of service disruptions on London's Tube, in advance of this year's Olympics.

The move comes just days after the mapping service added detailed traffic data to its mapping service - data which many sat-nav companies charge a hefty fee to access.

The Tube service offers warnings of upcoming service disruptions on Tube lines and stations, similar to the information offered by Transport for London's website and apps.

'Ahead of a busy summer in London, we are bringing real time service alerts for the London Underground to Google Map,' said Google via the official Google Maps blog.

'Weâ€™ll let you know of any disruptions on the Underground that are happening at the time you need them most. To see these alerts, click on a station in a timetable or in the public transport directions results.'

Google Maps also recently added traffic updates for all roads, allowing users to assess typical traffic by time of day for smaller roads as well as major highways.

The service already offers public transport directions for national train routes, London Underground, DLR and bus routes.

The information is available via the browser-based Google Maps, and also via the Android Google Maps app

Outside London, the app has details 
for 2,500 stations in the UK, and offers timetable information via 
TheTrainline - which means that Maps users can
access the information without leaving the app or the site.

Visitors can click through and book via the Trainline, but all information is free, and works within Google Maps.

Google's train directions service shows how to get from the Museum of Reading to Llandudno Pier - a jounrye lasting 5 hours and 43 minutes
