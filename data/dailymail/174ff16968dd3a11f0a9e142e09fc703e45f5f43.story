Good news: Harvard junior Dario Guerrero found out he was an illegal immigrant at the age of 16, and thought getting into college would be tough. But when he applied to the Ivy League school, he was accepted and given a free scholarship 

A junior engineering student at Harvard has written a touching essay about the moment an admissions counselor told him he could go to school for free, despite his status as an illegal immigrant. 

It wasn't until high school, at the age of 16, that Dario Guerrero  discovered he was living in the country illegally and a community college he was taking courses at called up to ask about his invalid social security number.

'Son, we overstayed our visa when you were three. You don’t have a social security number,' he recalled his mother saying, in an essay for the Washington Post.

The southern California resident and another undocumented friend named Oscar then began their quest to find a college that would accept them, and give them the financial aid their families needed. 

While most schools will accept illegal immigrants, financial aid is trickier since, at the time, you needed a social security number in order to receive federal grants. 

Dario and Oscar's only choices then were private schools, and specifically those few 'need-blind' schools which would give them enough aid so as not to bankrupt their families. 

Near the end of high school, when Dario was preparing to apply to schools, he took a trip to several East Coast colleges and most of the counselors he met with encouraged him to apply. 

However, he had his sights on MIT and was let down when the counselor told him it would be nearly impossible to be admitted. 

The counselor told Dario that the only way the school admitted undocumented students was as international students. 

In order to qualify as an international student, Dario would be required to leave the country and then re-enter the U.S. through an international border. 

Having lived in the country illegally nearly all of his life, Dario certainly would have been stopped from re-entering the U.S., so he knew that wasn't an option. 

But things started to turn up when he wandered over to a nearby Ivy League campus. 

'My dream crushed, I left the office in a daze and started walking down Massachusetts Avenue. Without really planning it, I found myself in the middle of Harvard. 

'Since I was there, I found the Admissions and Financial Aid office and walked in to tell them the truth, too. An officer agreed to see me. My meeting was brief, but it suddenly reversed all the self-doubt.

Second choice: Guerrero's dream school was MIT, but the school wouldn't accept him unless he left the country and came back as an international student. Instead, he walked over to Harvard's campus (pictured) and found he was welcome there, no matter his immigration status

'“If you are admitted to Harvard College,” she said, “we will meet your full financial need without regard to your legal status.” 

Dario applied and a few months later received the joyous news that he had been admitted and qualified for a full-ride scholarship. 

While the university doesn't require a social security number for financial aid, it does ask for some evidence of income. 

His parents had filed taxes every year, so he was able to submit that and no further questions were asked.

'This meant I wouldn’t have to worry about student loans or quarterly tuition payments; that I always had a place to stay away from home; that I could travel every semester, on Harvard’s dime, back to California; that my parents would never have to worry whether I’d finish school. Those are luxuries few people, documented or not, ever have,' he wrote. 

Dario admits that his situation is rare in the undocumented community, that there are others just as bright as him who can't attend college because their parents never filled out taxes, or if they can, must hold down multiple jobs just to keep up with the payments. 

While this is the burden of undocumented children, he also identifies with his parents' choice to break the immigration rules. 

Dario writes about attending a recent Harvard-Yale football game where his fellow Crimson supporters held up signs reading 'We are the 6.2 per cent' referring to the low admission rate. 

'The opportunity to one day join the 6.2 percent (or the 1 percent, or even just the 100 percent of legal residents who live without fear of deportation) is worth crossing the border for.' 

Guerrero is currently studying visual and environmental studies at the Cambridge, Massachusetts school. He also co-directed the film 'A Dream Deferred' about  four undocumented students at Harvard.

His dream school, MIT, told him he was unlikely to attend since he would have to leave the country and re-enter as an international student

He applied to Harvard instead and only had to provide tax documents to get full scholarship
