Protesters rallying against police violence following the shooting of black teenagers Michael Brown and Vonderrit Myers held a demonstration at the NFL Monday Night Football  in St. Louis.

A large banner reading, 'Rams fans know on and off the field black lives matter,' was hung over of the top of the jumbo video board  during the third quarter of the game between the Rams and the 49ers.

A few minutes later, about three-dozen protesters marched with their hands raised in an aisle just below the upper deck in the south end zone. Five police officers followed them.

The group could be heard chanting Brown's name, as well as slogans such a 'hands up, don't shoot', 'shut it down', and 'black lives matter'.

Outside the ground protesters waved placards with slogans such as 'Touchdown 4 Mike Brown' and 'Black Lives Matter' before, during and after the game.

The protests stem from the August shooting death of Brown, who was black and unarmed, by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

Yesterday saw hundreds of protesters rallying in pouring rain as they took to the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, with police making around 50 arrests. 

Among those arrested was prominent civil activist Cornel West who had joined more than 1,000 people march through the Missouri city to rally against police violence.

The Princeton University philosopher and author was hauled away in handcuffs as protesters called for the arrest of a white police officer who shot dead unarmed teen Michael Brown in August.

He was one of at least 50 detained by officers at the demonstrations which went on late into the night. 

Ahead of his arrest, West told a crowd at Saint Louis University on Monday: 'It's a beautiful thing to see people on fire for justice but I didn't come here to give a speech. I came here to go to jail.'

He added that he wanted to help the black youth get their voices heard.

'The larger system has been victimizing and coming at them,' he said.

West joined hundreds of protesters taking part in the 'Ferguson October' rally. The Rev. Osagyefo Sekou, a Boston-based minister and activist, was also arrested, MSNBC reported.

The protesters are calling for the arrest of a white police officer, Darren Wilson, who killed  Brown. Last week, another black teenager, Vonderrit Myers Jr., also died at the hands of a white police officer - further inflaming tensions.

Some protesters attempted to block a door to the police headquarters and faced off with law enforcement officers wearing riot gear. 

Amid the tense standoff, some protesters sang the song 'We Shall Overcome,' an anthem of the civil rights movement of half a century ago. 

Protesters have numbered in the thousands at some events since Friday in the St. Louis area in demonstrations aimed at drawing attention to what they say is police mistreatment of blacks. 

A grand jury is considering charges against Wilson, who has been placed on administrative leave. Protesters want Wilson arrested immediately and have called for the appointment of a special prosecutor. The U.S. Justice Department has launched a civil rights investigation into Brown's death.

Activists have traveled from across the United States to join in four days of protests dubbed 'Ferguson October,' culminating on what organizers call 'Moral Monday' with activities protesters said likely would result in many arrests. 

On Sunday, at least 17 protesters were arrested by police in riot gear for refusing to disperse during a spontaneous sit-in at a convenience store. Officers said protesters threw rocks, while cops responded with pepper spray, witnesses said.

Just hours later, on Monday morning, hundreds of protesters  descended on Saint Louis University campus  and announced they were there to stay.

The university march - which was far larger than previous overnight marches in Ferguson - was the first of what was expected to be a series of acts of civil disobedience around the region on Monday, theNew York Times reported. 

As they walked through the streets, they shouted: 'Indict, convict, put the killer cops in jail, the whole damn system is guilty as hell.'

When they reached the campus, they announced they were staging a sit-in. 

'As of right now, this is our spot,' a protest leader beside the clock tower on the campus said at 2am on Monday. 'We're not going anywhere. This is our land. Everybody get comfortable.'  

Vonderrit Myers Sr., whose son was shot dead in Shaw last Wednesday, told the crowd, 'You make my heart easier,' before he held a four-minute moment of silence.

Sunday's arrests were in the same neighborhood where the second shooting occurred.   

St. Louis police spokeswoman Schron Jackson said 17 people
had been arrested for unlawful assembly early on Sunday at the
parking lot of the QuikTrip convenience store.

But Mervyn Marcano, who is handling media relations for a group
that provides jail support for protesters, said at least 19
people had been arrested. 

St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson tweeted that protesters were throwing rocks at the police - but the 
protesters responded on Twitter that they had not thrown anything.

Witnesses transmitting live video from the small overnight
protest in the Shaw neighborhood - where Myers was gunned down - showed a few dozen
people sitting on the ground outside the convenience store.  

Witnesses said some people were hit with pepper spray and what appeared tohave been tear gas, though that could not be confirmed. 

The shootings - which police say came after altercations with the young men - have cast a spotlight on the state of race relations in the U.S. two years after black 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot dead by a Florida neighborhood watch officer in another high-profile incident in 2012. 

The events in Ferguson have focused global attention on the state of race relations in the United States and evoked memories of other racially charged cases, including the fatal shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012.

More than 1,000 protesters shouted slogans at police on Sunday night into the pre-dawn hours on Monday in St. Louis, near where the white off-duty officer shot and killed Myers last week. Police said Myers had opened fire, but his family maintained he was unarmed.

Last Wednesday, an off-duty white officer working for a
security firm shot dead 18-year-old Vonderrit Myers Jr. in the
Shaw neighborhood in what police described as a firefight.

There were no reports of arrests at protest rallies on
Saturday that drew thousands of people.

The police have largely
adopted a non-confrontational stance and protest organizers work
to maintain order and a non-violent approach. 

The mother of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old shot dead onAugust 9 by white officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, walked at thefront of a rally on Saturday evening in the suburb of Ferguson.

Lesley McSpadden, who has criticized Ferguson police, has
only rarely participated in protests. She eventually left the
group, which grew to over 1,000 people and moved on to Ferguson
police headquarters.

Brown's death triggered a national uproar in August over
police accountability and protesters have called for the arrest
and prosecution of Wilson. A grand jury is
now considering the case.

At the culmination of the Ferguson march on Saturday night,
protesters shouted insults at a line of police in helmets and
shields, with some demonstrators wearing bandanas or scarves
over their faces. But there were no arrests or violence, a
police spokesman said. 

Earlier on Saturday, thousands of protesters in downtown St.
Louis marched and rallied at a plaza, where organizers included
Hands Up United, an activist group that emerged after Brown's
death.

Union members, gay rights activists and people from the
Occupy movement joined in.

Civil rights organizations and
protest groups had invited people from across the United States 
to join vigils and other weekend events in the St. Louis area.

'This isn't going to stop until there is change with police
and black youth,' said Tory Russell, a founder of Hands Up
United.
