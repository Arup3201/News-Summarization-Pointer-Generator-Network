The flag over the Taliban's Qatar office was reportedly still flying today despite the U.S. government's promise to its Afghan counterparts that it would be removed.

Afghan president Hamid Karzai has already promised to boycott peace talks, and the Taliban styling their Doha office as a diplomatic mission risked worsening tensions.

As well as the flag, the newly opened office in Doha where talks between the fundamentalist group and the U.S. are due begin had opened with a sign announcing the 'Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan'.

After objections that was later replaced with one that read, simply: 'Political office of the Taliban'.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai said his government has suspended negotiations on a security deal in protest at the not being included in initial peace talks with the Taliban

Suspension comes just 12 hours after U.S. said it would hold talks with the Taliban at its newly opened office

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had also promised Afghan officials that the flag would be removed, but today it was still flying, albeit on a shorter flagpole, according to the BBC.

Mr Karzai is understood to feel 
betrayed by the failure of U.S. officials to extract commitments from the 
Taliban to engage with the Afghan government, recognise the constitution
 and renounce violence before the talks took place.

In protest that the peace process was 
not being 'Afghan-led', Mr Karzai also suspended meetings on allowing 
9,000 US and 6,000 allied troops to remain in Afghanistan following 
Nato's withdrawal in 2014.

He suspended both sets of talks after the deaths of four US soldiers in a rocket attack at the Bagram airbase outside Kabul.

The Taliban claimed responsibility and
 the attack fuelled concerns that a peace deal could hand Afghanistan 
back to the extremists who have killed 444 British troops since 2001.

Aimal Faizi, Mr Karzai's spokesman, 
said: 'There is a contradiction between what the US government says and 
what it does regarding Afghanistan peace talks.'

Meanwhile, it has emerged that the 
Taliban are ready to free a U.S. soldier held captive since 2009 in 
exchange for five of their senior operatives imprisoned at Guantanamo 
Bay, a senior spokesman for the group said today.

The only known American soldier held 
captive from the Afghan war is U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl of 
Hailey, Idaho. He disappeared from his base in southeastern Afghanistan 
on June 30, 2009, and is believed held in Pakistan.

In an exclusive telephone interview 
with The Associated Press from his Doha office, Taliban spokesman 
Shaheen Suhail said that Sergeant Bergdahl 'is, as far as I know, in 
good condition.'

'He is, as far as I know, in good condition': Shaheen Suhail said U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl (pictured) could be freed in exchange for five of senior Taliban fighters currently imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay

Among the five prisoners the Taliban 
have consistently requested are Khairullah Khairkhwa, a former Taliban 
governor of Herat, and Mullah Mohammed Fazl, a former top Taliban 
military commander, both of whom have been held for more than a decade.

Sergeant Bergdahl's parents earlier 
this month received a letter from their son who turned 27 on March 28 
through the International Committee of the Red Cross.

They did not release details of the 
letter but renewed their plea for his release. The soldier's captivity 
has been marked by only sporadic releases of videos and information 
about his whereabouts.

The prisoner exchange is the first 
item on the Taliban's agenda before even opening peace talks, saidn Mr 
Suhail, who is a top Taliban figure and served as first secretary at the
 Afghan Embassy in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad before the Taliban
 government's ouster in 2001.

'First has to be the release of 
detainees,' Mr Suhail said when asked about the captive sergeant. 'Yes. 
It would be an exchange. Then step by step, we want to build bridges of 
confidence to go forward.'

Tensions are high after four soldiers were killed by the Taliban at the Bagram Air Base (pictured)

The US announced 
negotiations with the Taliban on the same day that Nato handed over 
security for the country to the Afghan government.

US President Barack Obama said: 
'Ultimately, we're going to need to see Afghans talking to Afghans about
 how they can end the cycle of violence.'

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the insurgents 
fired two rockets into the base outside the Afghan capital, Kabul, late last night.

American officials confirmed the base had come under attack 
by indirect fire — likely a mortar or rocket — and that four U.S. troops
 were killed

The Karzai announcement and the 
latest attack may hamper the peace process just 12 hours after the U.S. 
announced the milestone negotiations due to be held in Doha.

In a statement from his office, Karzai said negotiations with the 
U.S. on what American and coalition security forces will remain in the 
country after 2014 have been put on hold.

The deal was expected to 
define the future of American troops here and also pave way for billions
 in aid to the Afghan economy.

Karzai's statement followed an announcement yesterday by the U.S. and the 
Taliban that they would pursue bilateral talks in Qatar before the 
Afghan government was brought in.

He
 said: 'In view of the contradiction between acts and the statements 
made by the United States of America in regard to the peace process, the
 Afghan government suspended the negotiations, currently underway in 
Kabul between Afghan and U.S. delegations on the bilateral security 
agreement.'

The Taliban said yesterday they would open a 'political office' in Qatar to conduct peace talks on Afghanistan

The U.S. Embassy in Kabul said it has no immediate comment.

The
 Taliban indicated yesterday that they would be willing to talk with the
 Afghan leader despite previously dismissing him as an Afghan puppet.

But both the American side and the Taliban said they would first meet together before any talks with the Afghanistan government.

The Taliban has opened a political office in Doha with the intention of 
starting peace talks, which was a reversal of months of failed efforts to start
 negotiations. 

President Barack Obama cautioned that the peace talks with the Taliban 
would be neither quick nor easy but that their opening a political 
office in Doha was an 'important first step toward reconciliation' 
between the Islamic militants and the government of Afghanistan.

It is not clear how long Karzai plans to suspend negotiations on the NATO agreement for.

The
 security handover is due to pave the way for the departure of the 
majority of coalition forces - currently numbering about 100,000 troops 
from 48 countries, including 66,000 Americans - within 18 months.

The
 NATO-led force is to be cut in half by the end of the year, and by the 
end of 2014 all combat troops are to leave and be replaced — contingent 
on Afghan governmental approval — by a smaller force that would be on 
hand for training and advising.

NATO troops are to be cut in half in the coming months with Afghanistan taking control of security

The
 U.S. has not yet said how many troops will remain in Afghanistan, but 
it is thought that it would be a force made up of about 9,000 Americans 
and 6,000 allies.

Six years
 ago, Afghan security forces numbered fewer than 40,000, and have grown 
to about 352,000 today. But questions remain if they are good enough to 
fight alone.

The Afghan Taliban has said it wants a political solution to the 12-year war that would bring about a just 
government and end foreign occupation.

Taliban
 officials held secret negotiations in Norway over the past few months 
that played a significant role in the opening of the Taliban's Qatari 
office, foreign minister Espen Barth Eide told state broadcaster NRK.

In setting up the office, the 
Taliban said they were willing to use all legal means to end what they 
called the occupation of Afghanistan — but did not say they would 
immediately stop fighting.

American officials said the U.S. and 
Taliban representatives will hold bilateral meetings in the coming days.
 Karzai's High Peace Council had been expected to follow up with its own
 talks with the Taliban a few days later but it was now not clear 
whether that would happen.

The Afghan Army has swelled in size since 2007, and now numbers more than 350,000

Yesterday, a formal agreement meant Afghans will now have the lead for security in all 403 districts of Afghanistan's 34 provinces.

Until now, they were responsible for 312 districts nationwide, where 80 per cent of Afghanistan's population of nearly 30 million lives. Afghan security forces were until now carrying out 90 per cent of military operations around the country.

Foreign forces will continue to support Afghans on the battlefield when they require it, but the Afghan army and police will be responsible for planning and leading military operations against the insurgency.

'As your forces step forward across the country, the main effort of our forces is shifting from combat to support. We will continue to help Afghan troops in operations if needed. But we will no longer plan, execute or lead those operations. And by the end of 2014, our combat mission will be completed. At that time, Afghanistan will be fully secured by Afghans,' NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said.

Called 'Resolute Support,' Rasmussen 
said the goal of the new mission 'is to train, advise and assist Afghan 
forces. We will also play our part in the broader international efforts,
 to ensure the long-term sustainment of the Afghan security forces. This
 will be another visible demonstration that Afghanistan does not stand 
alone, now or in the future.'

The U.S. and its allies have already pledged to fund the Afghan forces in the immediate years after 2015.
