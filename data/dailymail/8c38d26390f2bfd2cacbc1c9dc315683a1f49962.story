Eidur Gudjohnsen is aiming to turn back the clock and thrill Bolton fans again after the 36-year-old returned 'home' 14 years since he last played for Wanderers.

The veteran Icelander is back at the club he first joined in 1998, aiming to experience a late-career renaissance having returned to these shores following short stints with Tottenham, Stoke and Fulham.

Gudjohnsen embarked on an upward trajectory when he left Bolton in 2000, enjoying trophy-laden spells at Chelsea and Barcelona, but he has failed to settle since despite playing in France, England, Greece and Belgium.

Yet the forward, who last Friday penned a deal with Bolton until the end of the season, is optimistic he can rekindle some of the old magic now he is back in familiar surroundings at the Macron Stadium.

'Injuries came into play and in certain situations in the latter stages of my career I've found it difficult at times to settle in at clubs that I've been to,' he said.

'Whether it's been adapting to the style of play, or the surroundings - it just hasn't worked out at times.

'I feel like I've been here for a couple of years already because it feels like home.

'Now it's just a matter of me being hard on myself in the next few weeks and being as ready as I can when called upon.'

Gudjohnsen, who needs international clearance before he can make his debut, is realistic enough to acknowledge he will not be the same player who helped Bolton reach two play-off campaigns and FA Cup and League Cup semi-finals during his two-year spell.

But he does believe that a career which has seen him play under the likes of Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola will give him an edge in the second tier.

'Last time I was here I was a young boy with very fresh legs and now in footballing terms I'm probably an old man,' he noted. 

'It will be more playing on experience, trying to read situations before anyone else and the mind just has to make sure that the legs and body will follow.'

Gudjohnsen may not be the only veteran player to join Bolton's ranks out of the transfer window either, with ex-England forward Emile Heskey, also 36, training with Neil Lennon's men as Wanderers assess whether the free agent is worthy of a similar short-term deal.

Lennon's other attacking options lack experience and the duo of Gudjohnsen and Heskey have 140 international caps between them. 

The Iceland forward played for Wanderers between 1998 and 2000 and was a fans' favourite 

'And about 100 years together as well,' Gudjohnsen joked.

'He's a physical presence and you can still see it; there's not much changed in him. If he wants to play and if he's hungry to play then I'd love for him to be with us.

'Any bit of quality, any bit of experience, any bit of competition within the group is always helpful and whether it's him or other players, we want to find a healthy competition to get the best out of each other.'
