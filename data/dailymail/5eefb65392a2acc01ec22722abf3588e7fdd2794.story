Angry: Captain Roberto Bosio, who was off-duty but helped co-ordinate the evacuation, said Schettino was a 'disgraceful man'

An off-duty captain who co-ordinated the Costa Concordia's evacuation has condemned the ship's skipper as a 'disgraceful' man.

Captain Roberto Bosio, 45, this afternoon broke his silence over claims Francesco Schettino abandoned ship before passengers and failed to make a mayday call as the ship listed.

He said: 'Only a disgraceful man would have left all those passengers on board. It was the most horrible experience of my life. A tragedy, a heartache that I will carry with me forever.'

Off-duty Bosio, who captains the Concordia's sister ship the Serena, was only on board the ship by chance as he made his way back home to Savona, near Genoa.

Bosio, who is engaged and lives in Ventimiglia on the French-Italian border, was in his cabin resting when disaster struck.

He helped dozens of woman and children into lifeboats, and is understood to have organised the entire rescue effort throughout the night.

Survivors have also said that as the keen biker left his cabin he told every passenger he met to put on a life jacket.

He added: 'We managed to avoid the worse and have the world crash down around us. I just want to rest and forget.

'Don’t call me a hero. I just did my duty, the duty of a sea captain – actually the duty of a normal man.

'I and the others with me just did our duty. We looked each other in the eyes for a second and then we just got on with it.'

Bosio's comments came after one Schettino's former captains labelled him 'a braggart, a show-off' and claimed he drove the luxury liner 'like a Ferrari'.

Captain Mario Palombo also revealed he had to put Francesco Schettino in his place 'more than once' when the under-fire commander acted as his deputy on the now doomed vessel, La Repubblica reported.

His claims came as Italian divers again suspended their search of the capsized ship at 8am after it shifted slightly on its resting place near the Tuscan island of Giglio.

Fire services spokesman Luca Cari said 
the shift of a few centimetres posed a potential threat to diving teams 
operating in the submerged spaces of the ship. It increased fears the 
vessel could soon dislodge from the rock and plummet 100m down to the 
bottom of the Mediterranean.

Schettino, 52, a captain since 2006, now faces a possible 15 years in prison for multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship while dozens of passengers were still aboard.

Yesterday the death toll rose to 11 when divers located five more bodies, all of them adults wearing life jackets, in the rear of the ship near an emergency evacuation point. A total of 24 people are still missing.

The tongue lashing given to Schettino by an angry coastguard has been turned into a £12 T-shirt.

The shirt, bearing the phrase 'Vada a Bordo, Cazzo' - went on sale within minutes of the recording of the coastguard's row with captain Francesco Schettino was made public.

Widely read as 'Get on board, damn it',  Italian translators say the phrase is really far more forceful than that.

One said: 'In one way it can mean 'F***ing get on board' and in another way it means 'Get on board, you p***k'.'

Prosecutors have alleged Schettino was trying to show off by sailing past the Tuscan island of Giglio, where his head waiter lived, when he ran the ship aground just 150m offshore.

The ship should have been at least five miles out to sea, but struck rocks Schettino claimed were 'not on his chart'.The liner then continued for several hundred metres before running aground further along the coast.

Schettino, who started his career on a ferry boat near his home on Italy's Amalfi coast but has now been stripped of his command, has now been ordered by an investigating magistrate to undergo a drug test.

Searching off the liner was due to continue today, before its suspension, with further explosive charges detonated around the superstructure. The aim is to make it easier for navy and coastguard diving teams to reach sections of the Concordia that still need to be searched.

Attention was due to be focused mainly on the restaurant on deck four at the back of the Concordia.

That
 was the location where the bodies of four men and a woman all aged 
between 50 and 60 years old were found yesterday, and where it is feared
 the rest of the missing passengers and crew are.

The search teams are racing against time 
as the weather is set to turn stormy tomorrow, with waves of up to two 
metres forecast as well as storm force winds.

The fear is that a large sea swell could easily 'lift' the liner from the rock ledge it is resting on and send it plunging 100m to the bottom of the sea.

Salvage teams are also expected to begin pumping off 2,280 tons of heavy duty diesel that is still in the ship's tanks and which are a ticking ecological time bomb as the area is a protected sea sanctuary for whales, porpoises and dolphins.

Meanwhile captain Roberto Bosio, who was off duty on the Concordia when the disaster struck and who has been hailed as a hero after giving the order to abandon ship, broke his silence and said: 'Only a disgraceful man would have left all those passengers on board.'

Captain Bosio, 45, who was seen helping dozens of women and children into lifeboats, added: 'It was the most horrible experience of my life.

'A tragedy, a heartache that I will carry with me forever. We managed to avoid the worse and have the world crash down around us. I just want to rest and forget. Don't call me a hero. I just did my duty, the duty of a sea captain - actually the duty of a normal man.

'I and the others with me just did our duty. We looked each other in the eyes for a second and then we Just got on with it.'
