Daredevils risked a frosty ending - using their ice-cool nerves to scale these icy climbs where just one mistake could cause the ice to shatter and collapse.

The breathtaking routes, found in the Canadian Rockies, were tackled by Jen Olson, Jon Walsh and Magda Kosior who braved treacherous conditions to explore the spectacular structures.

Each climb takes between four and six hours with the trio having to maintain intense concentration to avoid the dangers in front of them.

Hang on! Each climb takes between four and six hours with the trio having to maintain intense concentration to avoid the dangers in front of them

A small lapse could leave them vulnerable to falling ice, slashing their ropes with their own climbing axes and spikes, changes in weather and even avalanches.

From the other-worldly forest of stalagmites and stalactites on Neolithic to the dagger-like formation of The Real Big Drip - each route offers something unique to take on.

Jen, from Canmore in Alberta, Canada, said: 'The views are magical and lovely - but the route is tough.

Freezing weather, melting ice and blowing snow are just a few of the problems that are faced each day

'On Neolithic you have all your weight on your arms for long periods of time so the clock is ticking. You need to keep moving to keep holding on.'

Adventure photographer Paul Pride, who captured the trip in February this year, added: 'There is a difference of opinion as to which is harder - climbing ice or climbing rock.

'But I think ice is much more unstable - ice climbs form differently each year. Ice climbing provides a harsher climate not to mention the fact it melts and can break.

'There's no question photographing ice climbing can he hard on you and your gear.

'Freezing weather, melting ice and blowing snow are just a few of the problems that are faced each day as well as long hours hanging around in a harness or sitting on the side of a mountain waiting for the right shot.

'But the contrast of colours and locations make it all worthwhile - it really is one of my most favourite subjects to photograph.'
