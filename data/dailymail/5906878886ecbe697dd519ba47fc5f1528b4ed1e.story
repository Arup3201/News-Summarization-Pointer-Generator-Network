More than half the stores that featured on the BBC's Mary Queen of Shops show have closed, it was revealed today.

In the programme, screened on BBC2, 53-year-old retail expert Mary Portas tried to turn around ailing small businesses.

But an investigation has found that nine of the 16 featured have shut.

The Sun on Sunday reported that some shops were sold while others have been replaced in the High Street by giants such as Tesco.

The latest casualty was bankrupt general store Clealls of Corfe, which opened in Wareham, Dorset, in 1881.

The owners Chris and Juliet Porter, who also lived there, were forced to shut it this year after financial collapse.

She encouraged the couple to sell 
high-quality local produce and put on a successful tasting event at the 
store, with Mr and Mrs Porter handing out meat snacks and wine to 
customers.

However, last month Mr Porter questioned whether Ms Portas understood their customers' likes and dislikes.

He said: 'We were in trouble when Mary got here and it never really picked up when she left.

'Mary didn't make herself popular in the village. She has some good ideas but she thinks everyone comes from Hampstead Heath.

'She wants to have everyone sat there drinking lattes with top quality stock. We kept on telling her, we had a different customer base.

'We might have a few really rich people, or DFLs - down from Londons - as she called them, but then we had rural workers on £9,000 a year.

'Many people can't afford that. It's nice getting locally produced meat but you go to a supermarket and get a chicken for two quid or come here and get a breast of chicken for nine quid."

He continued: 'When she left, we certainly didn't have enough choice and the locals would say that - "you used to sell this", "you used to sell that".'

The couple are living in temporary council accommodation, having sold their London home to buy the shop seven years ago.

Mr Porter said: 'In the end we lost everything, we were made homeless and lost our jobs.'

The couple also claimed that Portas's revamp of Clealls was cheaply done and not fit for purpose.

Mr Porter explained: 'The original refit they've done on the shop was disgraceful, they used metal shelving that bent when you put three bottles of wine on it.

'When they wanted to do the follow up a few weeks later to show how things are going, I told them if they didn't come and fix the shop I would go to ITV to see if they would do a makeover show on the mess up.

'You couldn't run a business the way they'd left it. They sent down some carpenters who put some new shelves up for us - they didn't mention that on the show.'

Mrs Porter, 47, added: 'It was on the premise that it was going to change our businesses. What they promised and what we got were very different.

'They ran out of finances on day two and were looking for builders in the village to help white wash the shop.'

Mr Porter said: 'They don't want to spend any money on you. They used doors as shelves - its then quite easy to get someone trendy to say "that's the new trendy look".

'It's about Mary shouting at you. That's what people want, to come in and say how bad everything is to start with and then at the end get a smile out of you and say "look what I've done".'

But they also point to competition from Tesco and bad weather over essential summer months as reasons for their business going bust.

In summer 2011, tourists were put off by weeks of rain and the following year, Tesco began delivering to the area's campsites.

Mr Porter said: 'There are 10 major campsites around the village and they all signed up to have Tesco deliver to your tent.

'That had a major impact - our business relied on the campsite. During the summer we would see the campsite people every day, maybe twice a day.

'They would come in the morning before going to the beach and come in on the way back.'

Ms Portas pointed out that there are many factors that affect a shop's success.

She told MailOnline: ‘This was a shop [Clealls of Corfe] that was losing £6,000 a week when I went in to help.

'I'm so sad to see it close, but over four years all kinds of factors affect sales and it's a case of constantly trying to adapt to survive on today's high street.'

Her spokesman, David Wood, added that were it not for Ms Portas's help, the shop might have closed even earlier.

He said: 'Losing £6,000 a week would drive any business under ground in minutes, but they kept going for another four years, so something must have worked.

'We don't give people on the show rules, it's just advice - and they could have done something else in the four years since they met Mary.'

The BBC declined to comment.
