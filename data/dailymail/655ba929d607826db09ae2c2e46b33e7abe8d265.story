A man has had blank comic strip panels tattooed on his arm so he can fill them in daily. 

Patrick Yurick wanted to combine his love of comics with an unfulfilled desire to get a tattoo.

The perfect opportunity arose when the 30-year-old from San Diego saw a coupon deal for a cut-price inking.

Artistic: Patrick Yurick has four blank comic strips tattooed on his arm which he fills in daily

With the offer about to expire, Mr Yurick found himself getting four blank panels tattooed on his left forearm.

Thankfully, Patrick is a comic book artist so is able to fill in the strip several times a day.

Mr Yurick said: 'About a year ago I was on groupon.com and I saw that there was a deal for a $150 tattoo for $50. 

'I bought it. Mostly I bought it because I have wanted a tattoo for over a decade but could never commit to a design.

'I am too picky with my art and being married to one single design on my body was always a tough decision.'

After buying the coupon deal, Mr Yurrick and his wife started brainstorming designs.

'I knew that I wanted to honour my love for comic art', he said. 

'Originally I thought of ideas like getting an onomatopoeia, or even one of my favourite characters - but all of those would cost more than the original $50 base price of the tattoo. Fifty dollars equals one hour worth of tattooing.

'When we both came up with the idea it was like lightning and made so much sense that it seemed obvious.

Quirky: Patrick Yurick has had blank comic strip panels tattooed on his arm so he can fill them in daily

After buying the coupon deal, Mr Yurrick and his wife started brainstorming designs for his tattoo which turned out to be a blank tattoo strip which he fills in every day

'I decided on a four panel format as an homage to Bill Watterson, author of the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes.'

The comic strip is on Mr Yurrick's left forearm mainly because he is right handed although he says he can draw with both.

'I do draw them myself', he said. 'Sometimes I get in one or two a day and sometimes I just don't have enough time to finish them and I wait for a really great idea.

Dedicated: Mr Yurick sits at his desk with his pens creating a new design on his tattooed arm

'At the very base of this project is a simple design that is made to help me loosen my creative juices, if only for 10-15 minutes a day, as 10-15 minutes is how long it takes me to draw them. 

'Having a simple exercise like to pre-formatted tattoo on my arm really is about having fun with art and not thinking too much.

'I do take the comic seriously though. My ultimate dream with the whole project is to generate a couple hundred strips and take the 50 best and make them into a high quality picture book.'
