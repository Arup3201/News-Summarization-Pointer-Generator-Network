This is the moment a rare white lion was seconds away from death at the hands of a rival pride - until she was saved by an electric fence.

The endangered cat was being mauled by five ferocious females when one of them accidentally brushed against a high-voltage wire and reared back in shock.

This momentarily distracted the other attackers - giving the lucky lioness a chance to escape.

Ferocious: The endangered lioness had been cornered by the blood-thirsty attackers following a territorial battle between her pride and theirs

The white cat had been cornered by the five lionesses following a territorial battle between her pride and theirs.

The two groups, referred to as the Ross and Giraffe prides, had been involved in a vicious fight, which saw the beasts hitting, mauling and biting each other.

The lioness, who is part of the Giraffe pride, was left behind when the rest of her group retreated without her.

The ferocious battle, which unfolded at Kruger National Park in South Africa, was caught on camera by game ranger and photographer Ken Whyte.

Vicious: She bares her teeth in a bid to keep the Ross pride members away

'This was an incredible one-of-a-kind experience as the white lion is a rare and treasured animal - with sightings becoming few and far between,' said the 22-year-old.

'To see this rare animal being cornered,
submitting and then being attacked was a sight that would bring goosebumps to 
the most seasoned guides.

'Although it was a fast-paced and 
vicious battle, the fact she managed to escape with minor wounds made it
all the more amazing.'

White lions, which were first documented
in 1938, are not 
albinos - their unusual colour is caused by a rare genetic mutation.

There are fewer than 10 of the beasts surviving in their natural habitat, according to the Global White Lion Protection Trust.Â 

There are many more in captivity in zoos throughout the world, but these cannot be reintroduced to the wild.

Today, there is still no national or international law to protect the white lion species, which campaigners say is even more endangered than the rhino.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
