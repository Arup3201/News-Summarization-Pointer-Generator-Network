Mobile phone users across Australia have vented their anger after two of the country's largest mobile phone networks crashed.

Customers were unable to make phone calls or send text messages when Vodafone and Optus suffered a major technical glitch called a 'failed transmission link' on Thursday.

The issue also spread to customers using Amaysim and Virgin Mobile, as they are part of the Optus network.

Frustrated Vodafone customers took to Facebook to express their anger.

Jarrod Rudd wrote: 'I absolutely hope I get compensated for my problems that I cannot rectify, which are your company's fault because your lines are down.'

Vanessa Rasmussen Bettina fumed: 'We pay for a service... Constant outages and then having to call to get them to compensate me is insulting. If it's not working we should not be paying.'

A post on Vodafone's Facebook page around lunchtime said: 'Hi everyone, we've just had confirmation that we're currently experiencing some network issues. We're working to restore these issues as soon as possible and we'll keep you updated throughout in this thread.'

But by 3.15pm a resolution had still not been found and a post on Vodafone's website said: 'No further updates at this stage. We'll update you again as soon as we have more information to share.'

A Vodafone spokeswoman told MailOnline their service was back up and running after 4pm.

The company is unsure how many people were affected because the outage was 'intermittent'.

The spokeswoman explained: 'At times some people could make and receive calls.'

Optus used social media to update its customers about its problems

Meanwhile, Optus advised customers via Twitter this afternoon to turn their phones on and off to fix the problem.

'Those customers affected, please turn your phone off & then on. This should fix the problem. We apologise again for the inconvenience,' they wrote.

Earlier in the day they said: 'We are aware of an issue affecting some Optus customers at the moment. We're currently investigating the problem and will keep you updated.'

Vodafone service first dropped out in Western Australia this morning and then customers on the east coast also began to experience major difficulties.

An Optus spokesperson told MailOnline on Thursday evening: 'We're currently trying to see who is back up and running.'

'Network issues': Vodafone used Facebook to communicate with their customers but were not able to give much information during the day

She explained that the company did not know what caused the outage.

They also weren't sure whether the Optus outage was related to the Vodafone outage.

In a statement they added: 'We are investigating the cause of an issue that is affecting the mobile services of some of our customers.

'We are working on the issue as a priority and will provide an update as soon as possible.

'We're really sorry, we know this is frustrating for our customers.'
