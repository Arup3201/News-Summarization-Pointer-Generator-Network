She is famed for her huge behind and since attempting to 'break the internet' Kim Kardashian has faced little in the way of rivals - until now.

Striking a Kim-like pose, this is Kit Kardashian the nine-year-old tabby cat who bears an uncanny resemblance to the American socialite.

The moggy, who is being cared for by Blue Cross after her owner died, was named after charity workers noticed her extraordinary large behind - which measures 10in across.

The cat also weighs a staggering 8.4kg - making her twice the size of the average domestic feline.

As well as her sizeable bottom, Kit has also perfected a cheeky coquettish look back over her shoulder as she mimics Kim's famous 'break the internet' nude pictures.

After being admitted to the Blue Cross pet charity, the cat was put on a strict new diet to help her shed the pounds.

Kit, who was previously named Phoebe, is currently being looked after by  volunteer Belinda Smith at her home in Cobham, Surrey.

She is hoping the tabby can find a new home.

Miss Smith, 53, said: 'I have been looking after her for two weeks now.

'A lady from Blue Cross brought her over to my home and when she came out of her cage I said 'Oh my goodness, she's a big girl'.

'A colleague had already come up with the name 'Kit Kardashian' after Kim's famous bottom - there is a striking resemblance.

'I have two other cats here but 'Kit' weighs 8.4kg - which is more than the other cats put together.

On a diet: Kit weighs 8.4kg, twice as much as an average cat. The moggy's owner recently died and although she is currently being cared for by a Blue Cross volunteer, the tabby needs a new home

'She was originally named Phoebe but everyone seems to prefer the name 'Kit Kardashian'.'

Miss Smith, who has been a volunteer at the charity for three years, said Kit 'struggles' to move but has a 'pretty face'.

She added: 'I hope we are able to find her a home. She tries to run around but struggles.

'But she has got such a pretty face and is such a lovely cat, I'm sure she'd make a new owner very happy.'
