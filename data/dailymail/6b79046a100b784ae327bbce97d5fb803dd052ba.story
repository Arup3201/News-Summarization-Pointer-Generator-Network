This is the moment a professional motorist tricks four driving instructors by 'playing dumb' before unleashing her rubber-burning skills.

Leona Chin, 28, from Malaysia, wore a 'nerdy disguise' for the secretly filmed prank, complete with ponytails, a SpongeBob SquarePants T-shirt and pink stockings - a far cry from her usual serious racing look. A big teddy bear in the back seat of the leaner-plated car topped off Chin's 'clueless' look.

To start the driving lesson, she performed a range of blunders, from repetitive stalls to wrong turns and dodgy gear shifts.

However, just when the unsuspecting instructors were starting to lose hope, Chin stepped on the gas. Footage shows one tutor squealing out in horror as she's forced back into her seat.

Another screams out to 'stop the f****** car!' as Chin drifts across an empty parking lot with smoke pluming from the engine.

One man exclaims 'you nearly hit the people' as he gets increasingly uncomfortable with the high speed.

After giving them the 'ride of their lives', Chin stops the car with a satisfied grin on her face.

One man appears to be having palpitations as he clutches his chest in fear. 

At the beginning of the driving lesson he'd seriously doubted Chin's skills, telling her she should probably get some more practice in before her next tutorial. 

Another man appears very unimpressed by the stunt.

'You nearly killed me,' he says as he gets out of the car and walks off.
