An 'inspirational' teacher at the UK's top state school tragically died of cancer just weeks after giving birth to her first child.

Valerie Hume, 28, received the devastating news she had the killer disease soon after giving birth to daughter, Isla.

She died just 10 weeks later, leaving husband James to raise their daughter alone.

Oxford-educated Mrs Hume had risen through the ranks to become Head of History at Kendrick School for Girls in Reading, Berkshire.

The school is the best performing State school in the country and tops the leagues tables each year for outstanding GCSE and A-Level results.

News of Mrs Hume's death was revealed to pupils and parents by headteacher Christine Kattirtzi on the school website on November 29.

She said: 'It is with great sadness that we have to announce the death of Valerie Hume, Head of History at Kendrick School.

'This followed, but was not connected to, the birth of her daughter in September.

'In due course events will be held in which we will remember and celebrate the life of our dear colleague Valerie.

'The school has been touched by the many messages of condolence that have been received from parents, former students and others from the wider Kendrick community who knew Valerie.

'Thank you to everyone for these kind messages of support at this very difficult time for us all.The school held a memorial service for Mrs Hume with pupils saying there was 'laughter and tears'.

Mrs Hume, nee Cooper, worked at at Didcot Girls School, in Didcot, Oxfordshire, before joining Kendrick School.

A Facebook page 'Rest In Peace Mrs Valerie Hume' which was set up in tribute to the teacher has been inundated with comments from friends and former pupils since her death on November 25.

One pupil wrote: 'Mrs Hume was a beautiful and intelligent teacher.

'She died on November 25 2012 having been diagnosed with cancer days after giving birth to her only child, a girl named Isla Rose.

'She was sometimes strict but she was wonderful, and anyone who was taught by her learned a lot.

'While pregnant she was very happy and appeared more kind than ever before.'

Another said: 'She was such an inspiration to her students and is the reason that many of the current A-level students decided to pursue history further.

'Mrs Hume was an incredible role model in her school community and her passing has moved us all.'

In 2011, Mrs Hume ran the Reading half marathon and one of her pupils will be running in her memory in March next year.

Charlotte McGarry is hoping to raise Â£500 pounds for Cancer Research UK.

She said: 'This is a cause that is very close to my heart.

'She was an amazing role model to to all her students and inspired many of us (me included) to pursue her subject further. It seems so unfair that such a beautiful and incredible life was cut short because of cancer.

'I want to help reduce the number of people who suffer because of cancer. For this reason, I will be running the 2013 Reading Half Marathon (inspired by Mrs Hume, who did so herself in 2012) to raise money for Cancer Research in her memory.'
