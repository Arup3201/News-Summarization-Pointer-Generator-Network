Rapist: Hesam Khosravi, 24, today had his 'unduly lenient' sentence increased from six to 11 years

An Iranian immigrant who filmed himself raping a woman at knife-point on his Apple iPad today had his 'unduly lenient' sentence nearly doubled.

Hesam Khosravi, 24, kicked and beat his victim and threatened to tape her mouth up during the attack in Trafford, Greater Manchester.

He was originally jailed for six years but the Court of Appeal increased his term to 11 years. Leading judges agreed with Attorney General Dominic Grieve that the original sentence was too short.

Khosravi pulled his victim around by 
her hair and forced her to strip and perform a sex act before raping 
her, Minshull Crown Court in Manchester heard during the trial.

The immigrant could be heard laughing
and commentating on the assault in Farsi as the woman cries and sobs 
throughout, in footage of the attack.

Police
found the recording on his iPad of the attack last April after he was arrested for an 
unconnected offence - but Khosravi claimed it was consensual 
‘role-play’.

Khosravi, who faces a deportation 
application on his release, had taken crystal meth before the attack, 
which made him ‘more aggressive’.

It was argued on Mr Grieve's behalf at the Court of Appeal in London that six years failed to reflect the seriousness of the offence, the need for deterrence and the 'public concern that offences like this give rise to'.

The appeal judges were told that 'aggravating' features of the case included 'deliberate and gratuitous violence' and 'degradation and humiliation', which included the filming of the crime on an iPad.

Increasing Khosravi's sentence, Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with two other judges, said: 'Watching the footage was an extraordinarily unpleasant task.

'Lenient': The Iranian was given six years behind bars at Minshull Crown Court in Manchester but today the Court of Appeal in London nearly doubled that term

'The victim's obvious pain and distress is excruciating to watch.

'How the victim must feel knowing that the recording has been shown in court and watched by outsiders one cannot imagine.'

She added: 'What is particularly chilling is the offender's calm dominance throughout.'

The judge said: 'The offender was determined to terrify and humiliate at the same time. He succeeded.

'His behaviour that night was simply cruel, and the lasting psychological harm he has caused is immeasurable.'
