Victim: Viloude Louis, 5, was found unconscious on the floor after she was brutally beaten

A 13-year-old boy has been arrested after allegedly using wrestling moves he had seen on television on his five-year-old half sister, who died from the brutal beating.

Viloude Louis suffered broken ribs, internal bleeding and a
lacerated liver after Devalon Armstrong repeatedly slammed her on a bed, punched her in the stomach, jumped on her and struck her with his elbow several times, police said.

Deputies say they received a 911 call 
from the home in Terrytown, Louisiana on Sunday afternoon saying the girl had been found unconscious on the bathroom floor.

Paramedics found the girl unresponsive and she 
was pronounced dead a short time later.

Armstrong was arrested on Tuesday after a coroner investigation found the girl died of multiple injuries, two days after the death, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's spokesman Col. John Fortunato said.

Detectives initially spoke with the girl's mother, Adlourdes Desvallons, 39, and found out that the teenager had been babysitting while she went to the store, Fortunato told The Times-Picayune.

Devalon told investigators the girl had a stomach ache and went upstairs to brush her teeth, and 30 minutes later he found her on the floor complaining her stomach still hurt, Fortunato said.

The teenager claimed he took the girl downstairs to the sofa and called 911 when he saw she was no longer breathing. Dispatchers told him to start CPR and paramedics arrived on the scene.

The coroner's office said there did not appear to be any outward signs of injury and her death was left as unclassified, but on Monday, Devalon told detectives he had been practicing World Wrestling Entertainment-style moves on the girl,  The Times-Picayune reported.

He said that even when his little half sister said she was in pain, he continued to carry out the moves on her. Detectives added that he appeared to be enjoying talking about the assault.

The Sheriff's office has now classified her death as a homicide and Devalon was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder and is being held at a juvenile detention center.

A probable cause hearing began in the case in Jefferson Parish juvenile court on Tuesday but was stopped after a defense attorney raised the issue of whether Devalon is mentally competent.

Psychiatrists will now need to evaluate and recommend whether or not he is able to participate in his own defense. A hearing for his competency is scheduled for next month.
