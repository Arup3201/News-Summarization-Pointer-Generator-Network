The grandmother of eight-year-old Imani Green, who was shot dead in a Jamaican grocery store while on holiday, has described finding her granddaughter in a 'pool of blood'.

Sandra Fisher, who lives in the northern Jamaican village Duncans, described the brutal aftermath of the shooting on Friday.

She said: 'My two little granddaughters were there and when one came back I said ‘where is the baby’.

'We went to the shop and I saw a little girl lying down in a pool of blood. I started to cry and everyone was crying and saying ‘why did they kill the little girl?’

She added: 'She is such a pleasant child; she is the daughter of my son who migrated to England around seven years ago.'

Imani had been allowed to take an 
extended break from her South London school to visit the country in the 
hope that it would help alleviate the symptoms of her sickle-cell 
anaemia.

She was shot in the head and shoulder when a masked gunman opened fire in the roadside shop and bar run by her cousin.

The girl's cousin Brandese Brown, a witness to the incident, told ITN: 'I could see the shot coming out of the gun, just a spear of fire.'

She said that the gunman had been wearing a hood at the time.

Eight suspects have been 'intensively interrogated' by police over her murder. The island's authorities have said they are confident of solving the killing.

One line of inquiry is that Imani was the innocent victim of gangsters fighting a turf war over an illegal lottery scam, according to Jamaica's Security Minister Peter Bunting.

The scam, which targets elderly 
Americans in the hope that they will wire money to Jamaica after being 
told they have won the lottery, is thought to have earned Jamaican gangs
£50 million (£31.8m) last year.

Around 500 deaths have been linked to
the scam, while it is also though to account for around half of the 
violent crime in the area where Imani was shot.

A second person was last night shot dead in
the village, half a mile from a roadside cafe 
where Imani was killed on Friday.

Following the incident, hundreds of stunned locals yesterday gathered at the scene. A police cordon was in place at the scene, where bullet holes could be seen in a silver Toyota Corolla.

Sources believe the gunman could be the same man who killed Imani and wounded three of her cousins.

One said the victim's first name was Xavier, although this has not been confirmed.

One resident, who did not want to be 
identified, said: 'People are whispering that he knew too much - he knew
who killed the little girl. That's why he got shot.'

Detectives have confirmed they are investigating whether the latest shooting is connected to Imani's death and say they are not ruling out any possibilities.

Detective Superintendent Anthony McLaughlin, of Trelawny Parish Police, said: 'Our scenes of crime officers are still down there examining the scene, it's too early for us to say what is behind this.'

He said the victim had not yet been identified.

Det Supt McLaughlin said: 'We are looking at whether the two recent deaths in Duncans are linked. To have two shootings within three days in this community is very unusual.'

Deputy Superintendent Steve Brown, from the Jamaica Constabulary Force, said the eight suspects in the first shooting, all men under 35, were being questioned but dismissed suggestions linking the shooting to gang warfare.
