Protective: Mary Berry has thrown her support behind Paul Hollywood

Mary Berry could walk away from The Great British Bake Off if co-star Paul Hollywood gets  the axe.

Mrs Berry continues to stand by the 47-year-old pastry chef following his marriage split and rumours of a close friendship with the glamorous star of the US version of the BBC baking show.

According to sources, Mrs Berry could quit Bake Off if Hollywood is axed for tarnishing the BBC2 show’s wholesome image.

News that he left his wife of 14 years Alexandra, 49, amid reports of a growing closeness with Marcela Valladolid has angered many viewers.

BBC bosses are said to have held high-level talks over Hollywood’s future with the show. 

Mrs Berry, 78, is said to be adamant that he remain, and is seen by many as his ‘saviour’.

It has even been suggested that she could walk away herself, rather than continue without Hollywood, with whom she has appeared on the BBC2 series since it began in 2010.

The pair have helped turn The Great British Bake Off into a major success for the BBC, attracting almost seven million viewers in the last series.

Earlier this month the show also won a Bafta.

Asked if Hollywood’s private life was causing concern among show bosses, a source said: ‘That is an understatement – it’s a complete nightmare.

'Needless to say the public reaction hasn’t been good. Bake Off is such a wholesome show it really doesn’t help us.

‘The team is split about 60-40 saying that he should stay, although it’s all dependent on public opinion.

‘Mary is the show and we know she has 
lots of high-level offers, and at the moment she is protecting him.

'If 
we sack Paul, Mary could walk and then we don’t have a show. Right now 
Mary is his saviour.’

Hollywood has been in Somerset filming episodes for the fourth series of Bake Off, to be broadcast later this summer.

Close: The chefs have been firm friends since meeting eight years ago

He refused to comment when approached by the Daily Mail.

He and Mrs Berry first met eight years ago on a Food Channel series.

Off-screen they share a strong bond and Hollywood affectionately refers to Mrs Berry as ‘Bezza’.

Hollywood and Miss Valladolid, 34, are said to have ‘hit it off from day one’ of filming in the US.

Hollywood has since moved out of his marital home in Kent to a studio flat, while last week it emerged Miss Valladolid had split from her husband.

Mrs Berry, who has been married for 47 years, defended Hollywood, telling friends: ‘Things happen and boys will be boys.’

But hundreds of fans of the baking competition have been far less forgiving, flooding internet forums to express disappointment.

Some are so appalled by Hollywood’s behaviour they don’t want him back on the show.

One wrote: ‘He needs to go – I won’t be watching GBBO if he’s on it.’ Another said: ‘Pleaseeee don’t say Paul Hollywood is a love rat?

'GBBO will never be quite the same!’ Another said: ‘Paul Hollywood has ruined the GBBO.’

Representatives for Mr Hollywood and Mrs Berry did not comment last night.
