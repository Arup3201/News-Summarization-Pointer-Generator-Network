AFC Wimbledon chief executive Erik Samuelson is dreaming of an FA Cup upset akin to the one they handed to Liverpool in 1988.

The Crazy Gang's victory against the Merseyside behemoths remains one of the greatest shocks in the competition's history.

It is a day Samuelson, at Wembley that day with his eldest son, will never forget and one makes Monday's third-round tie with the Reds all the more special.

'Dreams - that what it is all about,' the AFC Wimbledon chief executive said. 'It is a chance to dream about what might happen and fond imaginings of the end result. I'd like us to be seen to have done well in every respect.

'I want people to come away thinking this is a decent club, they know how to do things properly and they're respectful, but they gave them a hard time on the pitch.'

Samuelson additionally hopes Monday's match will highlight the Dons' need to move away from their current Kingsmeadow home, where just 4,800 will be in attendance for Liverpool's visit.

AFC Wimbledon have recently submitted a planning application to return to their spiritual home in Merton, with the club keen to continue the rise that began in 2002.

Infuriated by the decision to allow the old club to relocate to Milton Keynes, the Dons reformed in the Combined Counties League and have since risen to become League Two promotion hopefuls and reach the FA Cup third round.

'I think is a really important milestone,' Samuelson said. 'We've had a number of them since we started, be it our first ever game or the game that got us promoted to the Football League. it is up there with them.

'It is the first time we've ever reached the third round of the FA Cup and here we are and draw Liverpool. What more could any fan or any club official want for? It's absolutely brilliant.'
