McKayla Maroney rose to fame as one of the world's most talented gymnasts - but she sealed that fame with a disastrous fall in Olympic competition which cost her the chance of a gold medal.

That embarrassing tumble, and the way the athlete failed to hide her anger, has been a gift to online comedians, who have turned photographs of the very public event into a hilarious new meme.

Maroney missed out on the Olympic gold medal on Sunday after falling on her second attempt in the women's vault finals.

Foul mood: The gymnast's angry expression on the podium has proved fodder for internet jokes

Consolation: Maroney looked no happier as she talked to her coach after her embarrassing fall

After an almost flawless first attempt, the 16-year-old landed her second vault on her heels and her legs quickly skidded out from under her as a look of shock crossed her face.

Maroney was attempting a move called the Amanar when her dreams of a gold medal came unstuck.

The
 Amanar is one of the toughest manouveres in the sport and 
comprises a roundoff onto the takeoff board, followed by a back 
handspring onto the vault and then 2.5 twists in the air before landing.

Her
 first attempt went according to plan. She got great height off the 
table and her form was perfect in the air, with legs pencil-straight, 
and her body tightly coiled.

Faces: Maroney's expressions, from the joyous to the stoic, are the subject of a series of new internet memes chronicling the gymnast's journey in the London games

Apathy: Maroney's blank look is part of a new meme campaign from photos of the gymnast

She
 took a hop on her landing, and came down out of bounds. But even with 
that 0.3 deduction, she still scored 15.866, including a whopping 9.666 
for execution.

Another vault like that, and the gold was hers.

But
 it wasn't to be as she appeared to land the second one on the back of 
her heels, and her feet slid forward and she dropped to the mat.

In the zone: While Maroney's stunning performance on the vault last week clinched her team's place in history, she will probably best be known for her facial expressions, from the joyous to the sulk

The crowd gasped, and Maroney, who rarely makes errors in training or in competition, was stunned.

Maroney
 was considered all but a lock for the gold medal, which would have 
given the U.S. women three in the first three gymnastics events.

While Maroney's stunning performance on the vault last week clinched her team's place in history, she will probably best be known for the look on her face, from the joyous to the irreverent sulk.

More than a dozen images paraded by BuzzFeed.com captured Maroney in all her glory.

In one, a judge's jaw drops as she plants her feet on the mat. In another, she is fuming about the failed vault that had her landing in a sitting position.

It didn't get better after she was awarded a silver medal instead of the coveted gold, as Maroney rolls her eyes and shoots daggers against her rivals in subsequent photos.

Maroney appeared extremely unimpressed as she stood on the podium next to beaming gold medallist Sandra Izbasa of Romania and Maria Paseka of Russia, who won bronze.

She took to her Twitter page to vent her frustration, saying: 'Disappointed on how today turned out, but everything happens for a reason!! #no regrets.. Plus, the silver medal is actually pretty sick.' 

Had Maroney not fallen, she would have easily won gold because of the degree of difficulty in her vault.
