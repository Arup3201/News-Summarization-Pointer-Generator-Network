President Barack Obama is
considering a request from Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to slow
the pace of the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a
senior administration official told Reuters on Wednesday.

'President Ghani has requested some flexibility in the troop
drawdown timeline and base closure sequencing over the next two
years, and we are actively considering that request,' the
official said, speaking on background.

NOT SO FAST: Taliban soldiers are still running roughshod over parts of Afghanistan, and that country's president doesn't want Barack Obama to withdraw US troops according to schedule; on Tuesday a suicide omber targeted a police headquarters in Kunduz province

Ghani will travel to Washington next month to meet with
Obama. Last month, the Afghan president spoke publicly about the
U.S. plan to halve the number of troops in Afghanistan in 2015
and cut them further in 2016. 

He made clear he would prefer a
longer timeline and said: 'deadlines should not be dogmas.'

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during his Wednesday press briefing that while Obama has always favored 'a phased withdrawal' of U.S troops from Afghanistan, he 'has preserved for himself the flexibility to respond to the security situation on the ground.'

'The president's vision for this strategy has been consistent,' Earnest insisted to reporters.

Ashton Carter, Obama's pick to lead the Pentagon, told Congress last week that he was open to adjusting the drawdownplan. 

The U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan officially ended its combat
mission after 13 years of war at the end of 2014. About 13,000
foreign troops, mostly Americans, remain to train Afghan forces.

Afghan troops continue to fight Taliban militants. 

The
International Committee of the Red Cross has said it had seen
twice as many fatalities on the battlefield in 2014 than in the
previous year as fighting intensified.

American officials are looking for ways to support Afghanistan.

NOTHING TO SEE HERE: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest insisted that a change of plan was always a possibility

U.S. General John Campbell, the commander of international
forces in Afghanistan, has developed recommendations on ways to
train, advise and assist Afghan forces and maintain
counterterrorism capabilities, the official said.

The White House has already twice adjusted its plans to cut
U.S. troops to about 5,000 by the end of this year and draw down
to a 'normal' U.S. embassy presence in Kabul at the end of 2016.
