The killer of headmaster Philip Lawrence will be back on the streets within days after the Parole Board signed off his release from prison, the Daily Mail can reveal.

The decision to release Learco Chindamo will provoke horror and come only days after the murderous attack on teacher Ann Maguire in front of her pupils on Monday.

Chindamo was jailed indefinitely for knifing to death Mr Lawrence, a father of four, 18 years ago outside St George's Roman Catholic School in north west London in 1995. The teacher went to help a 13-year-old pupil who was being assaulted.

The former gang member was ordered to serve at least 12 years, but released in July 2010 after claiming he was a reformed character.

He was returned to jail only months later for breaching the terms of his Parole. He has remained in prison since but today the Parole Board approved his release once again.

The murder of Mr Lawrence, a 48-year-old father of four, shocked the nation in the same way as Mrs Maguire's stabbing on Monday.

He was knifed to death outside St George's Roman Catholic School in north-west London in 1995 when he went to help a 13-year-old pupil who was being assaulted.

A spokesman for the Parole Board said: ‘We can confirm that a three member panel of the Board has directed the release of Learco Chindamo.

‘The decision to release is a matter for the Board, which is independent - practical arrangements for the release are a matter for the Secretary of State. We are unable to comment further on the details of this case.’

There is no right of appeal for victims against the release and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has no role in the decision.

To approve the release the panel must be convinced that his being behind bars is no longer necessary to protect the public.

The decision will be a blow to Mr 
Lawrence’s widow Frances who spoke only yesterday about the murder of 
Mrs Maguire, warning her family they face a 'cruel journey'.

Only yesterday Philip Lawrence's widow, Frances Lawrence, spoke about the murder of Mrs Maguire, warning her family they face a 'cruel journey'

Telling how she was still suffering from his loss, Mrs Lawrence said there were 'no words of comfort' she could give to Mrs Maguire's husband and two daughters.

Yesterday Mrs Lawrence wrote on an online tribute site: 'By now perhaps I should have learned words of comfort for you, the family and community of beloved teacher, Ann Maguire.

'But I have learned only that there are no words. Instead I send all my love and prayers and my ongoing thoughts along the cruel journey which you are now forced to begin.'

Today a 15-year-old boy appeared in court accused of the murder while Mrs Maguire’s widower and two daughters looked on.
