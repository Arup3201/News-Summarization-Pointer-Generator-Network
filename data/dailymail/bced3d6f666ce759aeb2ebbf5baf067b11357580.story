Newcastle want Wigan’s Ali Al-Habsi to solve their goalkeeping crisis.

Manager Alan Pardew has identified the 32-year-old as back-up for Jak Alnwick should the Premier League change their stance on allowing them an emergency loan.

Newcastle were rebuffed in their initial efforts to sign a keeper following injuries to Tim Krul and Rob Elliot because they have Karl Darlow on loan at Nottingham Forest and another registered keeper in 17-year-old Freddie Woodman.

Newcastle's first choice goalkeeper Tim Krul is currently out of action with an ankle injury 

Alnwick will continue in goal against Tottenham in the Capital One Cup  but Newcastle are making a fresh appeal to the Premier League board in a bid to bring in reinforcements.

Pardew said: ‘We have two fit professionals and until you’re down to one you can’t have an emergency loan. Freddie Woodman is one, even though he’s 17. Karl Darlow can’t be called back so that rule is wrong. 

'If every other club can have an emergency loan and we can’t because we’ve got a player out on loan for a year doesn’t make sense. I think that is going to be looked at.’
