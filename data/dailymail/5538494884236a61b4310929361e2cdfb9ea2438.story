It’s a good job they all came into the world when they did, otherwise one grandmother would be $9million less the richer.

Audelia Ramirez, of Alhambra, California, won a lottery jackpot by using her children and grandchildren’s birthdays to pick the winning numbers.

The 73-year-old has six children, eight grandchildren and said she wants to celebrate by buying a new house after living in a small flat for years.

A California Lottery spokesman told MailOnline that she also wants to spend some of the winnings on her children and grandchildren.

Ms Ramirez won half of the $18million SuperLotto jackpot on August 31 and has now claimed her money, the California Lottery confirmed.

She bought the ticket from Superior Super Warehouse in Pico Rivera, but another winning ticket sold at Junior Liquor in San Diego is unclaimed.

Junior Liquor and Superior Super 
Warehouse will evenly split the $90,000 bonus for selling the winning 
tickets, reported the Pasadena Star-News.

Her winning numbers were 22, 27, 32, 31, 2 and Mega 11.

A spokesman for Superior Super Warehouse, where Ms Ramirez bought the winning ticket, did not immediately return a request for comment.

It comes as it was revealed this week Brian McCarthy, son of the millionaire Marriott hotels president Robert McCarthy, won $107million in the lottery.

The 25-year-old decided to buy his winning ticket as he was withdrawing money from an ATM inside a grocery store in Herndon, Virginia.
