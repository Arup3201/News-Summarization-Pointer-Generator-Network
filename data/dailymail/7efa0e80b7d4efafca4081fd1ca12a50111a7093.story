A Melbourne school student was seen pleading with two train ticket inspectors who had pinned him down over a fence for three minutes on Wednesday.

Footage of the incident, which occurred at Windsor Station in Melbourne's south-east, was recorded by witnesses and shows the two Metro Officers holding down the student from either side over a low brick wall at about 8:30am. 

'Can you f****** stop pinning my arm? You're breaking my arm,' the teenager, who was believed to have been wearing a private school uniform, is heard screaming.

A Melbourne student was seen pinned to a wall by two ticket inspectors at a Melbourne train station on Wednesday morning 

He then repeatedly asks: 'let me stand up at least,' before one man answers 'no'.

'You've already bloody resisted arrest,' the inspector is heard saying, and 'you presented a risk to us.'

Witnesses told Channel Nine news that the physical dispute occurred after the teenage boy allegedly evaded the inspectors three times following an apparent disagreement regarding his fare.

'I saw him try and jump over the fence and they pulled him back; they were holding and grabbing him,' another student said, adding 'I think they took it too far'.

He could be heard yelling 'let me stand up at least' while one inspector is heard saying 'No, you've already bloody resisted arrest'

'What the **** have I done? Jack ****, I've done Jack ****, alright? I've done Jack **** so get your ******* hands off me,' the student is heard saying.

'No I don't have any weapons on me you dumb ****,' he adds after being questioned.

Held at an awkward angle with his lower back on the wall while his upper back hung over the edge, the boy could be seen thrashing his legs around while the officers maintained their hold on him.

The video, which was recorded by a 32-year-old man according to The Age, was uploaded onto Youtube where it has been viewed more than 2000 times since being uploaded in the morning. 

The video was recorded by a 32-year-old man who posted it to Youtube, writing 'Absolutely disgusting use of force by transit officers'

'Absolutely disgusting use of force by transit officers this morning at Windsor Station on a school kid that HAD a Myki,' the man who recorded the footage wrote.

'Whether or not he "touched on" does not justify such aggressive tactics on a minor.

'8 Authorised Officers and 6 Police Officers for a $3 fare.'

Police were eventually seen attending to the scene and allowed the boy to stand. A Metro spokesperson has confirmed the incident is being reviewed  

A Myki is a plastic card that is used for ticketing purposes on public transport in Victoria.

Police were eventually seen attending to the scene and allowed the boy to stand.

A Metro spokesperson told Nine News that it would review the incident.

'As with any incident where an arrest is made, we will conduct a review of the incident to determine if the officers acted appropriately,' they said in a statement.
