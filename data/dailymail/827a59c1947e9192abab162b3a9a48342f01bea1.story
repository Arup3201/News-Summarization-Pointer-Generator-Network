A convicted drug trafficker has been charged with murdering a Canadian couple and their grandson who vanished two weeks ago.

The bodies of Alvin and Kathryn Liknes and five-year-old Nathan O'Brien have not been found but Calgary investigators say evidence has led them to believe that the trio were killed.

On Monday morning, 54-year-old Douglas Garland was arrested and charged with two counts of first degree murder in relation to the couple and one count of second degree murder for little Nathan.

Previous reports suggested that Garland, whose sister is in a relationship with a member of the Liknes family, had had a dispute with Mr Liknes over a sour business deal.

murder in the disappearance of  Nathan O'Brien and his 
grandparents, who vanished 2 weeks ago

Authorities said the claim, reported in the National Post, was just one line of investigation.

Garland had been named a person of interest in the case and was arrested last week, but was released after being charged in an unrelated case.

But on Monday, he was re-arrested in a field close to a property owned by his parents, where police have been searching for clues.

Garland had been staying at a hotel as part of his bail conditions but had been asked to leave, CTV reported. He is due to appear in court on Wednesday.

Investigators are still searching for
 the bodies of the victims, and are asking local residents to come 
forward with any information they may have.

'Rural
 property and business owners are asked to please search their 
properties for anything suspicious,' police said in a release.

Calgary Police Chief Rick Hanson told CTV that he believes a property owner or a hiker will see something to help the case.

'We will be relentless on this,' he said. 'We know how important it is not only for the family but the community to have closure to this by identifying and locating the bodies.'

Nathan and his grandparents vanished two weeks ago.

The boy was staying with the couple for a sleepover and when his mother arrived to collect him the next day, they were gone. They were reported missing by the boy's parents, Rod and Jennifer O'Brien, on June 30.

At
an earlier press conference, police confirmed that a 'violent crime happened' in their home. Authorities added they hoped that at least one of them was being kept alive.

'Even as the days went by, there’s always a hope, there’s always a glimmer of hope,' Hanson said at a news conference on Monday. 'Unfortunately with the laying of the charges, we’ve taken that hope away from the family. So they are devastated.'

Garland was remanded in custody for two days last week for possessing the identification of Matthew Hartley, a teenager who had died in a car crash in 1980.

He had previously assumed the identity to avoid authorities and gain employment.

Garland's criminal history dates back to 1992 when police raided his parent's farm on suspicion he was producing drugs. They found ingredients to make crystal meth, but no final product.

Drug charges were filed but Garland skipped town and lived on the run for seven years.

He was discovered in 1999 living in British Columbia under the name of the dead teenager, and later served 39 months jail after being convicted of drugs charges.

Garland had used the fake identity to gain employment as a chemical mixer, but that ended in 1997 after a promotion led to him suffering a nervous breakdown.

He then filed for unemployment benefits under the assumed name, but that was denied after his true identity was revealed.

Garland, who also dropped out of medical following a nervous breakdown, then sued in the federal tax court and won. His last encounter with the law was a traffic offence in 2009.

It was believed that he was driving a green Ford F-150 pickup seen near the Liknes family home on the night they disappeared.
