A Florida woman who was looking around the house for her cats found something much larger and more dangerous underneath her bed.

The 61-year-old Palm Springs resident was reaching down to find her two missing moggies when she felt the skin of 5'10'', 25-year-old suspected burglar Christian Vatovec.

Vatovec, who lives in nearby Lake Worth, leaped up after being touched and went through the home's backdoor before jumping over a fence and escaping.

The woman said that a gold bracelet and digital camera were missing from her house (pictured) after a burglar broke through the back door, though a police report only said Vatovec was found with a gold ring

Police found the suspect, who faces charges of burglary to an occupied dwelling, grand theft and resisting arrest without violence, near a canal by the house, according to Local 10.

Vatovec, originally from Staten Island, had been approaching homes in the area before entering the woman's residence by breaking the glass in a rear door, according to the police report.

The 61-year-old hairdresser, named locally, said that a gold ankle bracelet and digital camera with an estimated value of $800 were missing from her home after the Tuesday incident.

Vatovec was taken back to the scene of the suspected crime by police and identified by the woman. He had a gold ring, but was not stated as having the missing items. 

He was being held in lieu of $53,000 bail as of Friday.
