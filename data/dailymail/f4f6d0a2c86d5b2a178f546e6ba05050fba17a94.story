The nation's major supermarket chains and shopping centres are being urged to help stamp out the exploitation of vulnerable workers after it was found that some of its trolley collectors are paid as little as $5 an hour.

Workers in the physically demanding job are arguably among Australia's most exploited - a union advocate saying employees were being 'used and abused' by the system.

Investigating the industry, the Fair Work Ombudsman has recouped more than $400,000 in unpaid wages in the past six years at supermarket sites across the country.

The shocking findings comes as food retail giant, Coles, publicly admitted it has an 'ethical and moral responsibility' to stamp out exploitation of trolley collectors.

Trolley collectors are arguably among Australia's most exploited workers

Supermarket giant, Coles, allegedly knew that its workers were being underpaid and has signed an agreement which means they will need to back pay workers more than $200,000

Jason White from Trolley union in Brisbane says it's a physically demanding job and workers can be used and abused by the system

According to the 2011 Census, over a third of the 1500 strong national trolley collecting workforce is under 20 years old and 40 per cent do not have an education beyond year 10.

About 29 per cent were born outside of Australia, in non English speaking countries, and some have physical or other disabilities.

Jason White, of the Brisbane-based Trolley Union, said the job is physically demanding with no perks at all.

'Everyone is going non stop, especially on Christmas Eve and Easter Saturday,' he said.

'There are no time for breaks and the other downside is there is no overtime, no one will pay overtime, or penalty rates either.'

The former trolley collector turned trolley advocate said workers are often used and abused.

'It's not fair on them, if they stand and fight they get sacked and some have limited language so they don't know how the system works.

'Trolley collection is a multi million dollar industry. In Brisbane, contractors are pulling in about $250,000 a week in the metro areas but the worker doesn't see that,' he said.

In regards to Coles' pledge to improve conditions and pay, Mr White said it was good to hear, but believes there's still a long way to go.

A big day : A trolley collectors look on at what he has to do. It's been found that some workers are being paid as little as $5 a day

A number of (29 per cent) trolley collectors were born outside of Australia, in non English speaking backgrounds, and evidence suggests many have physical or other disabilities

The nation's major supermarket chains and shopping centres are being urged to help stamp out the exploitation of vulnerable workers after it was found that some of its trolley collectors are paid as little as $5 an hour

After its alleged admission of knowing about vulnerable workers, Coles said it has transformed its contracted trolley collection service across Australia to eradicate the underpayment of workers

'Coles is a little more bearable to work with but this is a step in the right direction but it's still going on,' he said.

Supermarket giant Coles has signed an Enforceable Undertaking and agreed to uphold the workplace rights of trolley collectors at all its supermarket sites

'There needs to be a national approach on the job to protect workers.' 

In the past six years, the Fair Work Ombudsman and its predecessor have recouped more than $433,241 for 528 underpaid trolley collectors at supermarket sites across Australia.

Fair Work has four separate matters before the courts alleging that collectively, 71 trolley collectors have been underpaid almost $485,000.

Following its admission of turning a 'blind eye' towards workers, Coles has given an undertaking to the Ombudsman that it will revamp its trolley collection services.

The supermarket giant has admitted its former practises were highly vulnerable to exploitation and poor employment practices which included the underpayment of wages.

Deputy Fair Work Ombudsman (Operations) Michael Campbell has welcomed the company's decision to sign an Enforceable Undertaking and uphold the workplace rights of trolley collectors at all its supermarket sites.

He hopes others would follow Coles’ lead, after Fair Work inspectors had found some trolley collectors being paid as little as $5 an hour for their physically demanding and often dangerous work. 

The Fair Work Ombudsman formally raised concerns with Coles late in 2011 about the exploitation and underpayment of trolley collectors employed by some of its sub-contractors at its sites.

In 2012, they commenced legal proceedings against two sub-contractors operating at several Coles sites, alleging they had underpaid 10 trolley collectors over $200,000. 

the legal battle against Coles has been dropped and it has agreed to back pay the 10 trolley collectors almost $221,000

It's believed that Coles knew that trolley collection employees at its sites were not being paid the correct minimum wages and conditions and that the company failed to take effective action to require its trolley service providers to comply with workplace laws.

But due to Coles' co-operation, the legal battle against them was dropped and it has agreed to back pay the 10 trolley collectors almost $221,000. 

'Taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for ensuring compliance by major companies like Coles, so it is pleasing that the company has agreed to accept this responsibility and take immediate action,' Mr Campbell said.

As part of the agreement, Coles will also establish a $500,000 fund that will be used to back-pay any other trolley collectors at its supermarkets who are subsequently found to have been underpaid.

In a statement from Coles, it said with the help of the Fair Work Ombudsman, it has transformed its contracted trolley collection service across Australia to eradicate the underpayment of workers. 

 

*It is responsible for compliance with all aspects of the law across its business operations

 

*It has ethical and moral responsibility to ensure all entities and individuals directly involved in the conduct of its business comply with the law

 

*Coles also needs to make sure contractors are meeting social and community expectations to provide fair, equal and safe work opportunities 

The supermarket company has also implemented fundamental permanent change to its trolley collection arrangements.

'Coles previously had more than 30 contractors but improved its operations in late 2012 by contracting to one national trolley collection provider, administered under a single external payroll.'

'Coles has also established a hotline for external complaints to be escalated to senior management while bank guarantee arrangements are in place with the sole contractor to secure against any risk of underpayments,' it said.

'Coles direct employees now collect trolleys at more than 400 of its stores and the aim is to have employees collecting trolleys at all stores by the end of 2016.'

'This year, Coles has also established an internal division, Coles Services, with approximately 700 employees and will move to more than 3000 by the end of 2016.'

'The enforceable undertaking agreed to by Coles will ensure that all trolley collection services are brought in-house by the end of 2016 and all affected workers are not out-of-pocket.'

United Trolley Collections has already entered into its own Pro-active Compliance Deed with the Fair Work Ombudsman and is committed to taking all 'reasonable steps' to ensure its sub-contractors are compliant with workplace laws.
