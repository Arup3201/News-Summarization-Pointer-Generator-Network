On guard: BT claims its new handset, the BT6500, can block 80 per cent of nuisance calls

Families have been handed a new weapon to block unwanted phone calls.

BT has launched the BT6500 telephone which, the company claims, will stop the menace of silent calls, withheld numbers, and overseas marketing scams.

Users can also programme specific numbers that they want blocked.

Rogue firms, many of them based in India, are responsible for a very large proportion of the nuisance calls to consumers.

They target individuals with bogus promises of refunds on the mis-selling of payment protection insurance or compensation for accidents.

The aim is to create a lucrative list of names and contact details that can be sold on to claims management companies who then take up the cases and charge huge fees.

The BT6500 will give users the power to block up to 80 per cent of unwanted calls, according to the company.

Frustrated customers are making more than 50,000 calls to its Nuisance Calls Advice Line each month.

At the same time the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, has revealed it is getting around 3,400 complaints a month about silent calls, which are particularly disturbing.

These are caused by call centre computers which automatically dial thousands of numbers at once.

Of those who receive silent calls, 57 per cent receive five or more a month, causing annoyance and, in many cases, distress and anxiety.

Peace: The new phone from BT helps households block unwanted calls from international and unwanted callers, like those from PPI claims firms

Ofcom has revealed that just over seven in ten people have received live marketing calls on their fixed-line phone in the past six months.

Older people are more likely to have been affected, with four in five aged 65-74 receiving these types of calls.

The BT6500 allows users to choose to block calls from numbers without a caller ID, plus so-called withheld numbers and those from overseas.

The handset also allows users to block up to ten specific numbers. It also has a ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode, which switches off the ringer and can either be operated manually or set by a timer.

Important calls from friends and family can still get through if they are saved to a list of VIP contacts.

The BT6500 is also equipped with parental controls which can stop outgoing calls to selected numbers, such as premium, mobile and international numbers.

John Petter, managing director of BT’s consumer division, said: ‘When people feel as though they are being harassed in their own homes they need to be able to take action. We believe this phone gives customers the peace of mind that when the phone rings it should be someone they want to speak to.’

The BT6500 costs £44.99 for a single phone, £69.99 for two, £89.99 for three and £109.99 for four.
