Ed Miliband was under fire today after his shadow cabinet colleague Ed Balls admitted he shared the 'frustration' of Labour's policy chief Jon Cruddas - who was caught attacking the 'dead hand' controlling the party from the centre.

Mr Cruddas, who is leading a review of Labour's policies ahead of the next election, was recorded attacking the party's leadership for blocking reforms and warned that the 'clock's ticking' before voters go to the polls in May.

Speaking this morning, Mr Balls - Labour's shadow chancellor - said he 'understood' Mr Cruddas's concerns.

But the shadow cabinet heavyweight insisted Mr Cruddas was frustrated with the way Labour's policies were reported in the media - rather than with Labour's leadership.

In comments leaked to the Sunday Times, Mr Cruddas told left-wing pressure group Compass: 'We set up independent review to rethink social policy, economic policy, democracy, local government - they come up with ideas and they're just parked, parked.

'There is all sorts of creativity alongside a profound dead hand at the centre. I'd love to say why we don't just appropriate this idea or that idea - but honestly it ain't going to happen at the moment, even though the clock's ticking, with a profoundly important general election.'

He said ideas were being replaced with 'cynical nuggets of policy to chime with our focus groups and press strategy'.

This morning Mr Balls appeared to back Mr Cruddas's remarks. He said: 'I understand Jon Cruddas' frustration about a newspaper headline.

'We've all been in a situation where a big report or a big speech is reduced down to just one policy.'

He told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: 'Jon Cruddas, with me and Ed and others, has been working for months, years, on big reforms. They are going to come out in the next few months, people will see the policy review he has led has been a big deal.

'One aspect of that is saying if we're going to have growth and jobs, not just in London and the south east - four fifths of the new jobs have been in London since 2010 - we've got to have more devolution of power to our cities and our county regions.'

Mr Balls added: 'He is part of the Labour centre and we are all working together on these big reforms," adding: "I talked to Jon a couple of days ago. He's not frustrated, he is excited about his policy agenda.'

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps Mr Cruddas's remarks showed that Mr Miliband was 'a weak leader of a divided party'.

Mr Shapps said: 'He's just not up to it. Labour are not serious about fixing the welfare system.

'Even Ed Miliband's own policy chief attacks Labour as having "no interesting ideas". It shows Ed Miliband has no plan to secure our country's future.'

The dominance of Labour's leading families needs to be challenged, the party's policy chief has claimed.

Jon Cruddas said power needed to be taken away from Westminster and its 'power elites'.

He pointed to the families which 'control' the Labour party and help their sons and daughters into Parliament.

The remarks are seen as a thinly-veiled reference to the party's 'Red Princes' - including Neil and Glenys Kinnock’s son, Stephen, and Jack Straw’s son, Will, who are both fighting seats at the next election.

Tony Blair's son Euan and Lord Prescott's son David are also thought to considering bids for Parliament.

Frontbenchers Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper are married - as well as Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman and the shadow policing minister Jack Dromey.

Mr Cruddas said: 'There’s a story about this week about certain families reproducing their control over the Labour party through inheritance of seats.'

He called for Labour to devolve power to local people. 'That means dispersal out of Westminster, and out of the centrifugal power elites that run it.'
