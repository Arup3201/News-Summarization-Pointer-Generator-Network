Three-time Olympic ski jump champion Thomas Morgenstern of Austria was hospitalized with unknown injuries on Friday after crashing during training for a ski flying World Cup this weekend.

Morgenstern lost his balance in the air, turned over to the left and landed on his back and head. He briefly lost consciousness but was able to speak shortly afterward.

'Fortunately he was responsive, Thomas can move arms and legs. That's very important,' team physician Herbert Leitner said. 'He asked me what happened.'
