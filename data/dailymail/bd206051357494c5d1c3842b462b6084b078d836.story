It's rare that the Popemobile’s speed is anything much above stately.

But, according to a German lawsuit, that doesn’t give his holiness an excuse not to wear a seatbelt.

The leader of the Roman Catholic church has been accused of breaking the law by not belting up during a visit to the city of Freiburg in September.

Pope Benedict XV1 is driven through Freiburg, Germany, in September. A Dortmund man has accused the Catholic leader of breaking the law by not wearing a seatbelt

Video evidence would prove Benedict 
XVI was not wearing his seatbelt ‘for more than hour’, the unnamed 
plaintiff’s lawyer Johannes Sundermann said.

He faced a fine of around 
£30 if convicted, Mr Sundermann added.

However, another German lawyer said: ‘The Pope is head of state of the 
Vatican, so it is highly likely he will be granted diplomatic immunity.’

One hundred thousands well-wishers welcomed the Pope as he drove around Freiburg; at one point, he even stopped to bless a child.

During his visit to his native Germany, the Pope admitted to the troubled reputation of the Catholic church.

He made a strong appeal for unity as he alluded to the dissent in Catholic ranks when he said that through the years 'damage to the church comes not from opponents, but from uncommitted Christians.'

He also urged the pilgrims to let their lives be guided by their faith, saying even those who doubt God's existence 'are closer to the kingdom of God than believers whose faith is routine and who regard the church merely as an institution, without letting their hearts be touched by faith.'

The pope drew large crowds at his stops in Berlin and in mainly Protestant eastern Germany, but the numbers were largest in the heavily Catholic south-western city of Freiburg.
