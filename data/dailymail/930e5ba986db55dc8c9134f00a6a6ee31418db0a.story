People are more likely to die at Christmas than at any other time of the year, a study shows.

U.S. researchers examined death certificates and discovered that people have the highest chance of death on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day.

They found this to be true of people who died of natural causes including circulatory problems, respiratory disease and cancer.

People are more likely to die at Christmas than at any other time of year - and the figures hold true for all age groups except children

The researchers, from the University of California, San Diego, say the figures hold true for people of all ages, except for children, CNN reports.

A study conducted in Britain this year also revealed people taken to hospital as an emergency on Christmas Day are more likely to die than they would be on other days, including weekends.

The researchers, led by David Phillips, a professor of sociology, do not know exactly why people are more likely to die over Christmas.

However, there are many theories.

Some believe it could be because people experience more stress and, sometimes, more sadness at Christmas.

Andrew Meacham, an obituary writer, told CNN: ‘We are always getting a slew of obits this time of year. I noticed this happened pretty regularly so I did call around to funeral directors to see if they believed there was an uptick too.

‘I've written many stories about a spouse or a partner dying and then you see the remaining partner die within hours or days or weeks or months. To me there seems to be a correlation between body and mind here.’

Dr Phillips studied deaths among people with Alzheimer’s.

He found there were more cardiac-associated deaths during the Christmas holidays and believes this could be triggered by stress in people with dementia who tend to be distressed by changes to routine.

In a bid to look for other explanations 
for the increased festive death rate, Dr Phillips decided to investigate
 whether cold weather was to blame.

Researchers believe the most likely explanation for the increase in death rates at Christmas is reduced access to healthcare

To his surprise, he discovered the increase in cardiac-related deaths at Christmas is lower in cold U.S states bordering Canada than in those that border the Gulf of Mexico.

The team then decided to look at whether festive eating and drinking was responsible.

But they also had to discount this theory as deaths among hospital inpatients also went up even though their diet and alcohol consumption is regulated.

The researchers were also surprised to find that the number of suicides is lowest in December and that homicide rates also drop.

As a result, Dr Phillips believes the real reason for the peak in deaths is related to the availability of healthcare.

He believes some people put off visiting a doctor during the festivities and that some hospitals have fewer staff at Christmas, increasing the death risk.

He bases this theory on the fact that the increase in death rates is particularly significant in patients admitted to trauma centres as emergencies.

He told CNN: ‘For those deaths, the spike was even sharper. Those are the cases where seconds make a difference and you may see a real difference between the response of a junior and senior member of staff.’

The news comes just days after experts at New York University revealed the number of people suffering from heart problems increases at Christmas.

They say the number of both fatal and nonfatal heart attacks increases, as does the number of people suffering from irregular heartbeats, CBS News reports.

This trend could be caused by stress, cold weather or overindulgence, they speculate.

But, researchers think it's most likely to be due to reduced access to healthcare and short staffed hospitals
