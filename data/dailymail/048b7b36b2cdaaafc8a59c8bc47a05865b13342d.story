This is the shocking moment a driver who was 'showing off' in a borrowed £100,000 Audi supercar crashed into another driver at 75mph in a residential street, killing her sister passenger

 sisters had been returning from a family 16th birthday party to their 
home in Kings Norton, Birmingham, when the £600-a-day vehicle hit them.

blue Ford at over two-and-a-half times the speed limit.

The court heard Hussain crashed his Audi R8 into a Ford Fiesta carrying Noreen Ryan, Birmingham

Hussain, from Birmingham, was handed a six year prison sentence at the same court.

Jailing him Judge Peter Carr said: 'You showed flagrant disregard for the rules of the road and were a danger to everybody on them.

'You have since said it was your fantasy to drive the car and that you were testing its capabilities, but it seems to me you were showing off.

'The words from the family do not even come close to adequately describing the pain and grief that they feel for the loss of Noreen.'

Emergency services were forced to cut off the roof of the super-mini to free it’s trapped occupants.

Investigators found Hussain had been driving at at last 76mph when he spotted the oncoming car and began to brake.

The court heard Hussain had picked up the keys of the car of the hired car from a table at a family wedding and had 'fantasised' about driving such a powerful car.

Prosecutor Joanne Barker told the court: 'Mary Ryan was not at fault in any way for what happened that night.

'Had he [Hussain] been travelling at the speed limit the collision would not have occurred.

'It is not the prosecution case he was racing with the Mercedes vehicle behind.

'The prosecution would submit he may well have been showing off.

'He did not adjust his speed despite seeing her. He was going too fast to do anything about it.'

After the crash Hussain climbed out of the wreckage and said to an injured Mary: 'I’m sorry it’s not your fault, it’s mine.'

Hussain and passenger Faizal Wahid, who suffered a broken cheekbone, jaw and eye socket and is now paralysed down the left side of his face, both fled the scene.

Robert Cowley, defending, said Hussain had shown genuine remorse for what he had done.

Before the crash he said he would have been described as a 'decent, hardworking, polite and respectable individual.'

A family tribute to Noreen, the youngest of her seven brothers and sisters, described her as the 'heart, spark and soul' of her family.

It said: 'Birmingham City was Noreen’s passion in life and she was a season ticket holder who never missed a match.

'But her family was also very important to her and she was a much-loved stepmother, step grandmother, daughter, sister and aunty to her nieces and nephews.

'Noreen was the heart, spark and soul of her family. She was overgenerous and loved buying presents at Christmas and birthdays.

'She enjoyed a glass of prosecco with the girls and had a great sense of humour and some fantastic one-liners.

'She had watched all of Birmingham City’s home matches with her brother John since they were kids. She always had the last word on football debates.'

Hussain was also banned from driving for six years.
