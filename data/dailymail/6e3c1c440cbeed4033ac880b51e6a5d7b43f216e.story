A once luxurious hotel in Mozambique which once prided itself on attracting wealthy businessmen and tourists is now providing shelter for thousands of impoverished people.

Built in 1954, the Beira Grande Hotel was dubbed the most most impressive hotel in Africa boasting 120 suites, a cinema, Olympic size swimming pool, helicopter pad and restaurants.

But the hotel closed in 1963 after little demand meant it never made a profit.

And ever since the colonial dream building has turned into a nightmare, first serving as a military base during Mozambique's civil war between 1977 and 1992.

Now squatters, many of them refugees occupy the Beira's once grand rooms and halls, as for many it is the only place to find shelter.

Around 3,500 people stay within the walls of the hotel, where drugs and disease are said to be rife.
