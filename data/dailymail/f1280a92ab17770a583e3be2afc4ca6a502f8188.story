A Massachusetts couple on Thursday finally claimed their share of a $122 million Powerball jackpot almost a month after scooping the prize on Thursday

But the lucky couple didn't quite manage to convey their joy in their official photograph.

Maureen, 51, and Stephen Hinckley, 61, of Sterling won a prize of $61,461,010 on December 11 but yesterday chose to accept the lump sum payment of $23.9 million after taxes from state lottery HQ.

The money will take a few weeks to arrive, so the Hinckleys are now planning what to do with their windfall - but they say it won't change them too much.

Brand-new millionaires: Maureen and Stephen Hinckley won a $61,641,010 jackpot, but they look like they are still in shock

The couple, who have been married for 38 years, said they have no immediate plans for the money beyond taking care of their four children and four grandchildren.

The identity of the biggest Powerball jackpot win since Massachusetts joined the lottery in 2010 had become the subject of massive speculation in the local area.

Maureen Hinckley told the Worcester Telegram & Gazette that the drawing came two days before her 58th birthday.

Yet the couple and their immediate family decided to keep their huge win secret until they had worked out the best course of action.

Maureen played the numbers (1, 10, 13, 18, 19 â€“ plus the Power Ball number 27), a combination of family birth dates, since Powerball came to Massachusetts. A Nebraska couple won the other half of the drawing.

Lucky stop: Maureen Hinckley selected the winning numbers in Appletown Market, Sterling, where she bought a lottery ticket every Saturday morning

Maureen bought the lucky ticket in Appletown Market, 9 Main Street in Sterling, her regular lottery stop every Saturday morning.

Masslive.com reported that the store owner, Chirag Patel, will himself get a $50,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket.

Maureen told the Telegram and Gazette she figures she won the money for a reason 'and hopefully I'll figure out what to do with it.'

Mrs Hinckley is a homemaker and her husband Steven is a material planner. He now plans to retire sooner than expected.

'We have always wanted to visit the 
National Parks and travel more, so that will likely be something we'll 
do once this has all settled in,' Maureen told Masslive.

'And my husband planned 
on retiring in the next few years, so that will be happening much sooner
 now,' she continued.

Dreams: The couple plan to travel and visit national parks, like the Grand Canyon, with their winnings

The lucky winner explained to the Boston Herald her shock at the moment she saw her numbers come up.

'I just kept saying, 'I can't believe it! I can't believe it!' I had someone check the number, and by then I called my husband.

'My son and my girlfriend came walking in, and we locked the door and didn't do anything. We wouldn't let anyone out of the house,' Mrs Hinckley recalled.
