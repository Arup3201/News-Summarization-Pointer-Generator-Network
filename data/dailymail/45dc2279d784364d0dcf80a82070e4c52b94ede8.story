It could be one of the biggest crowdfunding hits in history.

The Sense sleep monitoring system can look at not only how you sleep, but also everything from noise to light in your bedroom.

It was launched earlier this month on Kickstarter - and is set to end its campaign having raised $2.5m.

The system is controlled by a smart 'orb' that can monitor your bedroom and listen for loud noises or bright lights.

Sense's Sleep Score takes into account all of the sensor data and variables that it monitors to generate a score out of a 100 for your previous night.

It looks at both the environment of your bedroom, such as disturbances during the night, or your room was too bright for an ideal nights rest, as well as how you actually slept yourself.

A pitch black room might boost your score by +10, but a car alarm going off repeatedly might lower it -20.

The Sense app will give owners a breakdown and will also look for patterns, and help you to fix whatever is preventing people from reaching 100 per cent each night.

'It feels like a long time ago now, but just over 24 days ago I wrote about how we all felt at Hello after reaching over one million dollars in pledges after just four days,' James Proud, the inventor of the gadget wrote on the firm's Kickstarter page.

'It feels surreal that we have now doubled that to over two million dollars in pledges,' said Prund, who grew up in South London and is now based in San Francisco..

'Never in our wildest dreams did we expect this and in such a short amount of time,' he previously wrote.

The Sense system produces a sleep score for each night - and even work out if the neighbour's dog barked at 4AM.

'We spend a third of our lives asleep, and the rest of our time is completely dictated by how we slept - everything from how we eat to how we exercise,' James Proud, the 22-year-old Londoner behind the project told MailOnline.

He claims the current rash of sleep monitoring products are flawed.

The Pebble Watch, a smartwatch developed by Pebble Technology.

Smartwatch Pebble (right) raised $10.3m from 68,929 backers in May 2012, making it the most popular Kickstarter campaign ever.

Fledgling console maker Ouya raised $8.6m from 63,416 backers in August 2012 for its Android-based 'microconsole'

Neil Young's Pono music player and downloads store attracted $6.2m of pledges earlier this year.

Oculus Rift raised $2.4m from 9,522 backers in September 2012 - before being sold earlier this year for $2bn to Facebook.

'It's been a neglected area, but now there are a lot of apps and wearables that track our sleep.

'However, they don't seem to work too well.

'When you look at everything else, people aren't looking at why you sleep badly.'

The sense system has two components.

A main control 'orb' sits on the bedside table, and is packed with sensors to monitor everything from noise to light.

It also has a speaker to play white noise, or play an alarm in the morning.

The app shows readings over time - so can work out what temperature you sleep best at, for instance (left). It also gives a sleep score (right) that takes into account all the factors of your night's rest.

A second gadget dubbed the 'sleep pill' clips onto the pillow to track movement through the night.

Two can be used at the same time, allowing a couple to monitor their sleep independently - and the system can even tell which of them is snoring to keep the other awake.

Proud says the key to the system is that it doesn't require users to clip on wearable gadgets of put their phone in a certain place.  

The orb stays on the bedside cabinet, while a second sensor clips to the inside of a pillow, meaning the user does not have to put on any gadgets before going to sleep at night.

'It can unobtrusively track sleep - you should have to think about it, you should just go to bed.

'Bedroom is key - but room we look at least.

The main control orb is packed with sensors.

Ambient Light Sensor monitors the levels of light in your room.

Temperature and Humidity Sensors are able to detect the temperature and humidity throughout the day

A particulate Sensor can pollen and other material that triggers allergies.

The second sensor, the sleep pill, has accelerometers to detect the slightest movement, and is left clipped to your pillow.

It tells the orb how you are sleeping.

The app tells you how well you slept, or didn’t, by giving you a Sleep Score each night, and analysing the historic data to work out what temperatures and humidities you sleep best at.

'There are all these environmental factors, but we are in the dark about them.'

'We can see what's happening when you're asleep - are there loud noises, are you sleep talking, for instance.'

The system is controlled by an app.

The system also has a smart alarm that can wake users up at the right time so they are most rested

'You can see two main views - a breakdown of the revious night's sleep, but also a pre-sleep test that shows a live output from the data telling you historical patterns, so what temperature you sleep best at, for instance,' said Proud.

There is also a 'smart alarm' that  wake you in the morning at the right point in your sleep cycle, which experts claim avoids the 'groggy' feeling in the morning.
