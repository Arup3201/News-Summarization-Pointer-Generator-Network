The Second World War could have been prevented by a single document... but Hitler destroyed it before it was made public, MI5 secret files have revealed.

The last will and testament of Baron Paul von Hindenburg, Germany's president until his death in 1934, rejected Adolf Hitler's claim to the Reichstag and urged the nation to embrace democracy.

Such was the respect that Germany's political class had for Hindenburg, his dissent from beyond the grave would surely have been heard and may well have obstructed Hitler's rise to power, prevented war and changed the course of history, reported The Times.

Mistrust: The last will and testament of Baron Paul von Hindenburg (left), Germany's president until his death in 1934, rejected Adolf Hitler's claim to the Reichstag and urged the nation to embrace democracy.

But Hitler caught wind of the document and demanded it be brought to him before it was released. It was never seen again.

The claims, part of a haul of secret MI5 documents declassified last month, were made by Baron Fritz Günther von Tschirschky und Boegendorff, an aristocratic diplomat and confident of Hindenburg who helped draft the will.

Tschirschky claimed Hindenburg's will was a powerful attack on Hitler's ambition, declaring that the the army should be independent from parliament, that a constitutional monarchy should be established and that the legislative and executive branches of government should be separated.

'He said further that he wanted the 
rights of parliament established under a two-tier system on democratic 
lines, like that of Britain, and that he wanted all racial and religious
 discrimination abolished,' Tschirschky told the Times in 1947.

Hitler and hindenburg hated each other.

Hindenburg
 described his Chancellor as that 'Bohemian corporal', intentionally 
confusing Hitler's birthplace of Braunau in Austria, with Braunau in 
Bohemia.

Despite
 Hitler's repeated demands to be appointed as Chancellor, Hindenburg 
repeatedly refused until finally being forced by the deteriorating 
political stability of the Weimar Republic to grant the Nazi Party 
leader his wish.

His health failing, he issued a decree which 
suspended various civil liberties before signing the Enabling 
Act, giving Hitler's administration legislative powers.

He
 died the following year, after which Hitler declared the office of 
President vacant and, as 'Führer und Reichskanzler', made himself head 
of state.

But instead of sacking Hitler and 
declaring martial law, Hindenburg drew up a will - a 'bomb timed to go 
off posthumously and blow Hitler off course', wrote historian Ben 
Macintyre in The Times.

Before becoming Germany's president in 1925, Baron Paul von Hindenburg was a highly-decorated Prussian-German field marshal.

He first came under the national spotlight when, at the age of 66, he won the decisive Battle of Tannenberg, almost completely destroying the Russian Second Army in August 1914.

Becoming Chief of the General Staff in 1916, he quickly rose in the German public's esteem ultimately gaining more influence in Germany than the Kaiser himself.

Retiring in 1919, he returned to public life in 1925, surfing his wave of popularity to become president.

But the rise of the National Socialist Party made Adolf Hitler impossible to ignore.

Hindenburg described his Chancellor as that 'Bohemian corporal', intentionally confusing Hitler's birthplace of Braunau in Austria, with Braunau in Bohemia.

Despite his repeated attempts to spurn Hitler's advances on the office of Chancellor, the deteriorating political stability of the Weimar Republic coupled with the rise in popularity enjoyed by the Nazi Party forced Hindenburg to give in. He appointed Hitler as German Chancellor in January 1933.

In February, he issued a decree which suspended various civil liberties before signing the Enabling Act a month later, giving Hitler legislative powers.

He died the following year, after which Hitler declared the office of President vacant and, as 'Führer und Reichskanzler', made himself head of state.

Within
 hours of Hindenburg's death on August 2 1934, Hitler announced the 
offices of Chancellor and President would merge under his rule as 
supreme Fuhrer.

A vote was called to let the German people express their view of Hitler's unprecedented move to become head of government and head of state.

But as soon as he heard about the will, Hitler reportedly ordered his henchmen 'to ensure that this document comes into my possession as soon as possible'.

Colonel Oskar von Hindenburg, son of the late President but a loyal Nazi, duly handed it over. It was never seen again.

Instead, just before the vote, the Nazis published Hindenburg's 'political testament' - a glowing endorsement of Hitler and his political goals. Many historians believe it was a forgery.

Four days later, 38 million voters supported Hitlars coup. Five million people rejected it.

the next day, the Nazis made every member of the German army swear an obligatory oath of allegiance.

Baron Tschirschky insisted: 'Hitler
 would never have come into power, and there would have been no war, if 
the wishes of Hindenburg had been known to the German people.'

'We
 tend to see history in terms of unstoppable forces, great movements of 
economics or ideology that dwarf individual choice and volition,' wrote Macintyre. 'But small things also change history — the whistle-blower, the resister, the single, history-defining document.'

While Hitler must have destroyed the document he was given, two drafts survived.

Nazi agents tracked the first down to a bank account in Switzerland and destroyed it. The other was kept by Tschirschky.

But just before Tschirschky, a staunch opponent of Nazism, defected to Britain to spend the rest of the war in an internment camp, he said he burned his copy - the last written testament to Hindenburg's true feelings about Hitler and the future of Germany.
