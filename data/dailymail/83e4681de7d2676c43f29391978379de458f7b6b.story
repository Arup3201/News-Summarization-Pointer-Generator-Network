Mark Selby became the biggest early casualty at the Coral UK Championship as he bowed out to Irishman David Morris in York.

World champion Selby, who became a father for the first time earlier this month, was well short of his best form as he slumped 6-4 to the man from Kilkenny.

Victory gave world number 62 Morris the biggest scalp of his career and he clinched it in style with a match-clinching break of 79 in the 10th frame, having earlier fired in a match-best 126 to nudge closer to the winning line.

Morris turned 26 on Thursday, and he now heads into the third round at the Barbican Centre.

Selby had reached the final in each of the last two years, winning the 2012 title before finishing runner-up to Neil Robertson 12 months ago.

China's Ding Junhui avoided going the same way as the Leicester potter, fending off crowd favourite Jimmy White and winning 6-2.
