Denied: Daughter of Cuba's president Raul Castro, Mariela Castro has been denied permission to visit a Philadelphia even to receive an award for her international gay activism

The daughter of
Cuba’s current president and niece of longtime socialist dictator Fidel Castro
has been barred from visiting Philadelphia where she was to be presented with
an award for her gay rights activism.

Mariela Castro was invited to a conference next week on civil rights for the lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender communities sponsored by the Equality Forum, but
State Department officials said Thursday Castro's been denied permission to visit the U.S. for the event.

Malcolm Lazin, the
advocacy group's executive director, expressed his dismay to the Associated
Press.

‘We
find it shocking that our State Department would deny freedom of speech,
particularly at an international civil rights summit, to anyone, let alone the
Cuban president's daughter,’ he said.

State
Department spokesman Noel Clay said he could not comment on the case because
visa records are confidential.

Mariela
Castro, the niece of retired leader Fidel Castro, is director of Cuba's
National Center for Sex Education. As that country's most prominent gay rights
activist, she has instituted awareness campaigns, trained police on relations
with the LGBT community and has lobbied lawmakers to legalize same-sex unions.

Guillermo
Suarez, spokesman for Cuba's United Nations Mission, confirmed that Mariela Castro
was in New York on Thursday attending meetings related to the U.N. population
conference in Cairo in 1994.

She
is one of the experts designated by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to work on
the 20-year follow-up to the action plan adopted in Egypt, Suarez said.

‘That's
why she asked for the visa and it's the reason for her presence in New York,’
he said.

Suarez
said Castro ‘doesn't have any personal reaction’ to the State Department's
denial of her request to travel to Philadelphia.

The
Philadelphia-based Equality Forum sponsors an annual, dayslong international
summit on LGBT civil rights. Each year, the event spotlights issues being faced
by the LGBT community in a particular nation; this year, the featured nation is
Cuba.

Niece: Mariela is the niece of former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, who is now in his 80s

Lazin
said Castro had agreed to speak on a panel about Cuba on May 4 and was to
accept an award for her activism at a dinner that night. He did not expect any
visa problems because she had been granted permission to attend an academic
conference in San Francisco last year.

However,
a number of Cuban-American politicians criticized the State Department for
issuing Castro an entry visa for that event. They noted that U.S. rules
prohibit Communist Party members and other high-ranking Cuban government
officials from entry without special dispensation.

Castro
has no official link to the government aside from kinship, although the sex
education center is part of Cuba's public health ministry.
