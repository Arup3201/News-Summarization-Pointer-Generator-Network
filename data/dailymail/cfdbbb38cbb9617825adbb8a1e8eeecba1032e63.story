For years it was the pride of Britain's automobile industry.

But hidden beneath Birmingham's Longbridge site lies a greater, even prouder British secret - and one that helped with the war against Nazi Germany.

The ‘Shadow Factory Tunnels’ are the remnants of Lord Austin’s secret plans that were hatched to bolster British military might in the face of German military aggression in the arms race that led up to the start of the Second World War.

Hidden depths: The abandoned Shadow Tunnels, built in the pre-war years, lie hidden beneath the Longbridge factory in Birmingham

This was where munitions workers produced the Merlin engines that powered the Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes used to regain control of the British skies during the Battle of Britain in 1940.

The Shadow Scheme involved two parts - building nine new factories and extending existing factories - including the Longbridge plant.

Australian-born industrialist and 
Conservative MP, Lord Austin - also the founder of Austin Motors - had already contributed to the war effort in the First World War, turning his factories to munitions and engine production.

He was appointed to lead the Shadow Scheme by the head of the Air Ministry, Lord Swinton, 
after then Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain vowed in the desperate 
build-up to WW2 to rapidly expand UK production of war machines, 
weaponry and ammunition.

While
the factory at Longbridge was built underground to ensure the increase 
in war production was well-protected from possible bombing.

Shadow plan: The Government scheme involved the development of nine different factories and extensions to existing factories - such as the site at Longbridge

War effort: At the peak of the scheme in the 1940s, there were 26 shadow factories operating in Britain, producing munitions and parts for war vehicles and aircraft

Mass production: Tens of thousands of workers across Britain worked in shadow factories during the peak years of the scheme, producing around one aircraft every hour

Automobiles: Most of the factories involved in the scheme, like Longbridge, were car factories

Redevelopment: Since the collapse of MG Rover in 2005, part of the Longbridge site has been turned to commercial and residential purposes

At peak production point in the mid-1940s, there were 26 shadow factories in operation in Britain.

The factories employed tens of thousands of people, including munitions workers and sub-contractors.

Urban explorer Tom Robinson, 20, from Stoke-on-Trent delved into the tunnels to bring back exclusive pictures of Great Britain’s hidden wartime heritage.

'In 1936 Austin became Chairman of a shadow factory scheme set up by the government.

'At Longbridge, a flight shed was built, which is distinctive for its interior space and impressive roof structure.

'Close by was a new Aero Factory which would become known as the East Works.

'My pictures show the series of tunnels was also prepared to provide shelter from air raids and a safe place to relocate manufacturing operations in case of heavy bombing.'

Development: The 15-acre East Works site at Longbridge was built as part of a wider Government scheme, spearheaded by Lord Austin

Power: Coal-fired boilers with an underground cooling apparatus powered the East Works, where the engines were made for British planes

Cavernous: The tunnels stretch under most of the 15-acre site and had space for 10,000 workers

Equipment: Urban explorer Tom Robinson found much of the old machinery and lighting still in place when he photographed the tunnels

After the war, the factory returned to producing automobiles and the tunnels were abandoned.

By the late 1960s, the Longbridge plant was the second largest car plant in the world, employing some 250,000 workers.

But since the collapse of MG Rover, part of the site was redeveloped for housing and commercial purposes.

It was bought by the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation in late 2007 into 2008.

Tom explained why he felt it important for Britain to better-preserve wartime sites like this.

“It’s a travesty that nothing has been done to preserve any of the history of the Longbridge works, where British manufacturers such as Austin Motors and later MG Rover were based,” he said.

'There’s little to show what was once a huge employer in the area and a key player in the automotive industry.

'But I try to document what I’m seeing as I visit these places.

'I’m trying to give who ever looks at the photos a good insight into what there is to be seen.'

Lord Austin died in May 1941, four years before the Allied forces finally defeated Germany in Europe thanks in part to his effort.

Women of Britain: Hundreds of female workers were employed at the Longbridge shadow tunnels during the war when many men were sent to fight

Daily work: Even the warning signs, clocks and sinks are still in tact in the tunnels that made up the shadow factory

What lies beneath: The factory continued operating on the surface too, with more production going on below

Business as usual: At the end of the war, the Longbridge plant went back to producing automobiles - like the iconic Austin A40s shown here in 1948
