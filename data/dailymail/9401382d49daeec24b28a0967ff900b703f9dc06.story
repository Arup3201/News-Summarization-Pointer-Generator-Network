More trouble ahead? HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will likely face new questions after Jan. 1 about how many -- or how few -- Obamacare enrollees have made payments and are actually covered

The Department of Health and Human Services is in mid-victory-lap over its enrollment of an estimated 2.1 million Americans into Obamacare insurance plans, a figure claimed in a blog post Tuesday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. But as many as half of those customers have yet to make a payment, a new report suggests.

The Wall Street Journal interviewed Mark Waterstraat, the chief strategy officer at a firm that processes billings for insurers. He said that only about 50 per cent of enrollees in 17 states have paid their bills for the first month's premium.

That statistic, if it were to hold true across the nation, indicates that more than 1 million Americans counted in the Obama administration's total aren't actually covered by medical insurance.

Waterstraat's statistics cover more than 100 health insurance companies, which typically don't issue insurance cards or consider a new customer 'enrolled' until they receive payments. But the Obama administration has included in its public numbers everyone who has selected a plan – regardless of whether they have paid for it.

Marilyn Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, wrote Tuesday on the agency's blog that '[t]he most recent data indicates that more than 2.1 million people nationwide have enrolled in a private health insurance plan through a new Health Insurance Marketplace since October 1.'

That number would include enrollments from the District of Columbia and from 14 states that don't participate in the chronically troubled healthcare.gov website portal.

But Waterstraat's statement suggests that half of them either incorrectly believe they are insured, haven't received a bill, or are still deciding whether to pay.

Surge: As healthcare.gov's tech glitches were ironed out in December, more than 1 million new enrollees entered the system -- but how many of them have paid their bills?

Think you're covered? Better have one of these: More than 1 million Americans may expect insurance coverage on Jan. 1 but haven't paid their premiums

'We haven't written a check yet, because 
no one has asked me for one,' Kelly Turner, a Fairfax, Virginia 
homemaker, told MailOnline. 'This could be a disaster if I get hit by a 
bus tomorrow, God forbid.'

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius blogged earlier on Tuesday that enrollees are largely on their own if they're not sure whether their sign-ups are complete.

'If
 consumers have questions about their new private insurance coverage, 
they can contact their insurance company directly,' wrote Sebelius.

Few
 appear to have taken that advice. The Wall Street Journal reported that
 one health plan based in Temple, Texas only received first month's 
premiums from 35 of its new customers.

Some insurers expect customers to try to create their own proof of insurance.

'We anticipate that people will be using screen printouts' from 
insurance exchange websites, the Journal heard from Donna Zimmerman, 
vice president of government and community relations at HealthPartners, a
 Minnesota insurer.

Bad air out, good air in: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services chief operating officer Michelle Snyder (L) has stepped down as the Obamacare website saga nears its end; and CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner (R) now claims 2.1 million people have enrolled overall

Big picture: President Obama's public opinion ratings are still suffering from his false promises that Americans could keep their health care plans; many of the new enrollees are those who lost coverage anyway

Sebelius counseled Americans Tuesday on her blog to 'get your insurance card or a temporary card with your new plan’s information.'

'If you don’t have your card yet, ask your insurance company to give you another way to confirm your coverage.'

But for those Americans who haven't paid, that proof will be impossible to get.

'It's bad enough that the coverage is nearly twice as expensive as what my family had least year,' said Turner, the perplexed Virginian. 'But what good is the plan if I can't prove I've signed up?'

In a blog post on one of the year's quietest news days, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services claimed 2.1 million sign-ups for Obamacare

@highlight

But an executive at a health insurance billing company says only half of enrollees have paid premiums in 17 states where his company has clients

@highlight

That would leave more than 1 million Americans possibly thinking they're insured on Jan. 1 – but having no medical coverage at all

@highlight

Many of them are expected to bring website printouts to doctor's offices instead of insurance cards, but it's unclear how physicians will react
