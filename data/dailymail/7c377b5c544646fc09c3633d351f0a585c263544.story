Tesco has come near the bottom of a poll to find out which supermarket offers the best shopping experience.

The chain came eighth, only above budget stores Aldi and Lidl. Waitrose topped the list.

The survey assessed how easy it was to get around the store, the range in each department and how helpful the staff were.

Consumer experts rated Tesco in just eighth place out of the ten major supermarket chains, in a survey conduced by consumer website canieatit.co.uk

It also compared the prices, choice, quality and nutritional information of products from each store.

It is another blow for the retailer in 
what has been a bad year, suffering a disastrous trading period last 
Christmas, followed by profit warnings, share price falls and a revamp 
of its own brand range after poor sales.

Only no frill specialists Aldi and Lidl are below them while all of Tesco's so-called 'Big Four' rivals do better in the latest study by consumer website canieatit.co.uk.

Using its own research and feedback from thousands of users, the site  tested every aspect of the 'shopping experience' in each of the chains.

Waitrose came top of the table of Britain's favourite supermarket, despite being pilloried recently for being too middle class

Asda came in seventh in the survey conducted by Canieatit.co.uk above Aldi, Lidl and Tesco

Top of the table is Waitrose which, despite being pilloried recently for being too middle class, has improved its overall range while making its own label products more competitively priced, said canieatit.co.uk

This means it competes better with upmarket rivals like M&S and mid-market competitors like Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - the 'Big Four'.

Ocado, the independent online grocer which sells both branded and Waitrose own-label goods, is in second.

Marks & Spencer is in third with Sainsbury's behind them, slightly ahead of the Co-operative.

Morrisons and Asda follow, ahead of Tesco, Aldi and Lidl in the table compiled canieatit.co.uk compilers and contributors.

1. Waitrose - score: 9.5

2. Ocado - score: 9.0

3. Marks & Spencer - score 8.5

4. Sainsbury's - score: 8.0

5. The Co-operative - score: 7.5

6. Morrison's - score: 7.0

7. Asda - score: 6.5

8. Tesco - score: 6.0

9. Aldi - score 5.5

10. Lidl - score: 5.0

Professional food and drink taster Martin Isark, of canieatit.co.uk, said: 'Tesco, like Asda, has not done badly, they have just not improved as much as the supermarkets above them.

'Their aisle staff’s product knowledge is not as good as it could be. Waitrose, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury's lead the way.'

He added: 'The staff seem the least at ease of the big supermarkets.

'The fresh fish and meat counters are a big step down from Morrisons with their service and quality.

'The fruit and veg is not as consistent or as good as Waitrose, Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's or the Co-operative.

'The freshly baked bread is a notch below Sainsbury's and no better than Lidl's.'

A Tesco spokesperson said: 'We serve millions of customers each week and they tell us they like the improvements we’ve been making as part of the investment in our stores that's currently underway, including more staff on the shop floor to serve customers and better quality ingredients in our products.

'We are not complacent and are only just getting started with the work to build a better Tesco for our customers.'

Each chain is given an overall mark out of ten with Waitrose managing 9.5 down to Lidl with just 5.0.

Lidl, while cheap, did not offer good quality fresh fruit and veg, though other ranges were improving. There was no customer service desk, own brand labels were too complicated and it was hard getting hold of senior staff.

Canieatit.co.uk said there were more complaints about Lidl from his site's users than all the other supermarkets put together.

Tesco scores just 6.0 out of ten. Its prices are on a par with Asda and Morrisons said the analysis, but staff are 'the least at ease'.

Sainsbury's, who scored 8.0 out of ten, has a better range in some area, like bakery products, and better ready meals and own brands. Its staff are also more friendly and efficient.

The Co-op has improved both its range of products and the look of its stores said canieatit.co.uk while Morrisons does particularly well in its booze and fresh fish sections.

Some stores have a greater range of fruit and vegetables plus there has been an improvement in upmarket 'foodie' products, said the review.

Asda, in seventh, can boast cheerful staff but not necessarily knowledgeable, said the site. Its cafe is 'poor' and the prices, while competitive, are on a par with main rivals.
