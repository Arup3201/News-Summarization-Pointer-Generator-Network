Spain is mourning 'the end of a generation' after its champion squad crashed out of the World Cup in the first round at the hands of underdogs Chile.

And now, the disgraced players have to face the wrath of the internet.

Within seconds of the final whistle, memes began swarming Twitter, mocking the side as 'the Titanic'.

'Spain was the Titanic': Memes instantly started popping up on Twitter mocking the champions' early exit. This image photoshopped players onto a scene in the Titanic when the musicians vow to sink with the ship

Some have posted mock t-shirt sales, offering a Spanish strip for €4.99, adding: 'only worn twice!'

Many poke fun at striker Diego Costa, who was born in Brazil but chose to play for Spain, writing: 'How many times can you change your nationality?'

Spain's main newspapers also reacted with vigour.

Headlines across the country scream: 'Spain was the Titanic', 'Goodbye to a golden generation', and 'End of the party'.

While King Juan Carlos signed his abdication papers, making way for his son Felipe to take to the throne, almost as much space across the country's news sites and papers was dedicated to bemoaning the 'world tragedy'.

'Crash! The end of a unique generation,' sports newspaper Marca said.

'It was nice while it lasted,' sports newspaper AS said.

'The Spanish football team that has been the most deserving of a royal farewell ended its fairy tale in an atrocious way, in a world fiasco,' Spain's leading newspaper El Pais said.

Mistake? Brazil-born Diego Costa could have played for either side, both tipped to win, but chose Spain - and after the side's mauling spoof accounts started popping up mocking the forward's decision

The undisputed kings of global football in the last six years, Spain won the 2008 and 2012 European Championships and their first World Cup in South Africa.

But their supremacy is no more and an ageing team needs to be rebuilt.

Spain became the third champions in the last four World Cups to be eliminated at the first hurdle and their departure will almost certainly end the long international careers of their greats Xavi, Iker Casillas and Xabi Alonso.

Polls are now running on a number of Spanish news sites asking readers 'who is to blame for Spain's failure in the World Cup?'

Midfielder Andres Iniesta, who took the team to glory in 2010, said: 'It is a mauling nobody saw coming. We were at the very top and now we are at the very bottom.'

Chile's fans were optimistic after Spain suffered a 5-1 defeat to Holland last Friday.

But the scores of fans battling into Fifa's media suite had no idea they would send the reigning champions home so definitively.

A swarm of desperate Chilean football fans burst through security gate to force their way into Brazil's Maracana stadium before their team sent Spain crashing out of the World Cup last night.

Around
 100 fans wearing Chilean jerseys rampaged through the media room as 
they tried to find a way to the stands less than an hour before the 
match.

The key group match in Rio de Janeiro ended 2-0 to Chile, leaving the World Cup holders, and one of the favourites, Spain out of the competition.

They were seen sprinting through the 
huge centre underneath the stands, pushing and shoving their 
way toward a corridor they apparently thought would lead to the 
grandstands.

To get to the
 corridor, the crowd broke down a temporary wall, sending metal lockers 
crashing to the ground, according to witnesses.

Fifa declined to provide immediate comment, saying it would release a statement.

Once
 inside that corridor, the fans realised it didn't lead to the stands, 
so they turned around and headed back toward the media room.

There, security guards gained control of
 the situation about 15 minutes after it started, and forced dozens of 
fans to sit down in a group.

Many covered their face with scarves containing Chile's logo as they were photographed and filmed by journalists.

'I
 was the lone guy standing out there (near entry to press centre),' 
security guard Diego Goncalves said. 'All of a sudden they knocked down 
the fence and just pushed their way through.'

Asked how many guards should have been watching the entryway where the Chileans busted through, Goncalves said 'about 20.'
