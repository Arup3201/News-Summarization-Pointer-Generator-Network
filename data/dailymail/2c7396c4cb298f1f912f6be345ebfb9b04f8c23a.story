A female Rutgers University student has died after attending a small gathering at a fraternity house.

A preliminary investigation determined that the death of 19-year-old Caitlyn Kovacs may be alcohol-related, but the cause of death has not yet been determined.

Middlesex County prosecutors say the South Brunswick resident was sophomore at the university.

Middlesex County prosecutors say the South Brunswick resident was sophomore at the university. The cause of death won't be determined until an autopsy is completed by the Middlesex County Medical Examiner's Office 

They said Kovacs was at the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity house in New Brunswick when she appeared to be 'in distress' around 3 a.m. Sunday. 

She was taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital from the fraternity house by friends.

Hospital officials notified police about the death, which is under investigation by the prosecutor's office and the Rutgers and New Brunswick police departments. 

The cause of death won't be determined until an autopsy is completed by the Middlesex County Medical Examiner's Office.

Kovacs graduated from South Brunswick High School in 2013 and was studying animal science at Rutgers' School of Environmental and Biological Sciences.

Rutgers President Robert Barchi released a statement this morning, saying that 'We are deeply saddened to report the passing of Caitlyn Kovacs... Her passing over the weekend is a tragic loss to her family, her friends, and the entire Rutgers community.'

'I know this is a difficult time for everyone. We are offering grief counseling at two locations today at 7 pm. Staff will be available for counseling at the Student Activities Center (College Avenue Campus) and in the College Avenue Student Center,' said Barchi.

Barchi said one-on-one counseling is also available and encouraged anyone interested to call Counseling ADAP & Psychiatric Services at (848) 932-7884, or visit http://rhscaps.rutgers.edu/.

'Our counselors can provide support services, understanding, and assistance to help anyone in the student body better cope with this situation.'
