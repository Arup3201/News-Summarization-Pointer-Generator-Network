Anyone who was anyone in London society in the 1830s was expected to attend the Royal Academy exhibition. The playwrights and actors of the Drury Lane theatres, the Fleet Street art critics, the moneyed nabobs returned from India with grand town houses to fill with art from the masters of the day.

For the artists who exhibited in the Academy’s high-ceilinged rooms, the exhibition was the culmination of a year’s work. It had the power to make an artist’s name — or ruin him.

Each year, more than 1,000 pictures were exhibited in the crowded galleries, hung frame-to-frame from skirting board to ceiling. The power of the Academy’s Hanging Committee was immense.

A spot opposite the doors could mean an artist spent the next year being courted by aristocratic clients with commissions to paint their country estate, their beautiful wife or their adored King Charles spaniel. A painting unfavourably hung up by the cornice meant another year starving in a garret.

In this competitive field, painters resorted to all manner of dirty tricks to gain advantage.

The days before the opening of the exhibition, when artists were allowed to apply a final coat to their paintings in situ, were particularly fraught.

In 1833, two of the giants of British painting J.M.W. Turner and John Constable found that their paintings had been hung side-by-side in one of the main galleries.

Turner, who was touching up another picture in the next room, came several times to cast an eye between his ‘Helvoetsluys’ — a Dutch seascape — and Constable’s ‘The Opening of Waterloo Bridge’. This must have infuriated Constable, who was carefully applying flecks of vermilion paint to the flags decorating the barges of his own painting.

After several trips back and forth, Turner finally returned with his palette and, leaning close to the canvas, applied a daub of red, no bigger than a shilling, over his grey sea. He left without saying a word, the paint still wet and glistening.

It was another day-and-a-half before Turner returned, and then, in the last moments allowed for alterations, he glazed the scarlet shilling and turned it into a buoy bobbing in the harbour.

Constable told a fellow Academy member: ‘He has been here and fired a gun.’ What he meant, of course, was that this last-minute dash of elan — of sheer, breathtaking colour — was tantamount to an act of sabotage against his own painting hanging alongside.

The exhibition was a disaster for Constable. Even his friend the painter Thomas Stothard pronounced Waterloo Bridge: ‘Very unfinished, sir.’

The Morning Herald critic wrote: ‘What a piece of plaster it is!’ Then, adding insult to injury: ‘Mr Constable appears to think he is a Turner.’

If Constable did not already loathe Turner, there is no doubt he did from that moment on. Turner seems to have detested Constable with equal force.

This month, the rivals will be pitted against each other once again in two blockbuster exhibitions. In one corner of the ring is Late Turner at Tate Britain; in the other, ‘Constable: The Making Of A Master at the Victoria & Albert Museum.

The two artists, pioneers of a revolutionary style of landscape painting, were opposites in birth, looks and temperament.

Turner, born in Covent Garden in 1775 to a father who had a wig-trimming and barber’s business, was a monomaniac who preferred his palette and brushes to the convivial company of the dinner table.

A Miss Dart, who knew Turner in his youth when he stayed with her uncle near Avon, disobligingly described him as ‘singular and silent . . . mean and ungrateful . . . careless and slovenly in his dress . . . anything but a nice-looking young man.’

It is an image captured so brilliantly by the actor Timothy Spall in a new film about the painter that he won the Best Actor award at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.

Turner cared little what others thought of him. When a fellow member of the Academy, Sir Francis Bourgeois, called him ‘a little reptile’, he replied coolly that he was ‘a great reptile — with ill manners’.

He never married, but lived with his ageing father, who was always catching cold. Turner affectionately called him ‘Daddy’ even into middle-age.

Constable was a country lad. Born in 1776, he grew up in Suffolk, still known today as Constable Country. His father, an affluent miller, was keen his son should continue the family business rather than pursue the precarious living of a painter. While Turner was just 15 when he first exhibited at the Academy, Constable was nearly 40.

Unlike bachelor Turner, Constable was happily married to Maria Bicknell, the granddaughter of a Suffolk neighbour. He fervently believed his artistic success depended on her love. ‘All my hopes and prospects in life,’ he wrote to her, ‘are included in my attachment to you.’

They had seven children, and Constable’s friend and biographer C.R. Leslie recalled that the babies were as often in their father’s arms as their mother’s.

What the rivals had in common was an astonishingly vivid new way of looking at landscape.

While artists of the previous generation had set out to paint the landscape with topographical accuracy, Turner and Constable wished to capture its spirit.

Turner painted tumultuous storms over harbours, blazing fires, the smoke and steam of the new industrial age. He thrilled to weather at its wildest and most violent.

This recklessness is evidenced in an account given by a Cornish newspaper editor of a boat trip with Turner off the coast of Plymouth. While the other passengers suffered crippling sea-sickness in the ‘boisterous’ waters, Turner sat in the stern muttering admiringly: ‘That’s fine! Fine!’

Constable was intensely interested in the quality of light: the way scudding clouds cast shadows over fields, the haze after a downpour, late afternoon sun on a riverbank. He proudly wrote of his delight in decay and neglect: ‘Old rotten banks, slimy posts and brickwork — I love such things.’

They might have found much to admire in each other’s work, but Turner saw Constable as a young pretender with an eye on his crown. To Constable, Turner was a king to be toppled.

The Royal Academy, to which they both belonged, was a cauldron of ego, resentment, back-stabbing, in-fighting, factions, cronies and coups. When Constable first began to exhibit in London, he eagerly took to scheming, politicking and alliance-making.

He was delighted when in 1803, Turner, who had been feted as a ‘genius’ the previous year, had an unsuccessful exhibition. One of the reviews said Turner’s seas looked like ‘soap and chalk’, and enemies piled in with their own criticisms.

At one party, wealthy patron Sir George Beaumount was scathing about Turner’s ‘blots’. Constable, perhaps hoping to toady to Beaumount, chimed in with his view that Turner’s technique was extravagant and inattentive to detail.

When Constable was finally elected an Associate of the RA in 1820, after a long-fought campaign, he must have been sorely put out when one of the senior academicians took him to one side and advised him to make a study of Turner if he wanted to improve his own technique.

At times, the rivalry descended into pettiness and schoolboy insults. In his new book about the 19th-century art market, A Strange Business, the art historian James Hamilton quotes a letter from the painter Francis Chantrey to Constable, asking if it was true that Constable had said that ‘Turner’s pictures are only fit to be spit upon’. If only we had Constable’s reply.

Turner, for his part, could be just as childish. While making plans for a sailing trip with his friend C.R. Leslie, Turner discovered that Constable had been a guest at the house just a few days earlier and had put up the boat’s sail.

‘What does he know about ships?’ scoffed Turner. ‘This is how it ought to be.’ He immediately started untying and retying the knots on the boat, which to Leslie had looked perfectly ‘ship-shape’ as they were.

When it came to the Royal Academy exhibitions, Turner had an unnerving habit of looking over the shoulders of fellow painters and suggesting alterations. You can imagine the rage Constable must have felt at Turner’s last-minute stunt with the scarlet buoy.

As the two major exhibitions open, art historians and gallery visitors will again ask the question: which is the greater artist? The tempest-tossed Turner, or the romantic Constable of rainstorms and sudden sunshine? If there is one defining difference, it is this: stand in front of a painting by Constable and you are instantly cast back to late summer in the country, when the wildflowers were thirsty and toppling over in the heat and the harvested fields were as gold as ingots.

Or to an afternoon walk on an October weekend when the rain cleared and the sun shone and you thought you might keep on for another mile because the light was so unexpectedly bright and clear.

There is a nostalgia to Constable, who reminds you of the English landscape at its most beautiful and beckoning.

With Turner, there is something else. Constable — for all his own technical verve — reminds you of the landscape as you have seen it, Turner makes you feel it then and there with blustery immediacy.

A Turner painting whips you up in its storms and lashes you with its winds. The salt and spray from the waves settle on your lips, the steam and coal dust from his rattling trains make your eyes itch. And when he paints the Houses of Parliament caught in a raging fire, the heat, felt even across the Thames, even across the centuries, leaves your cheeks glowing and your skin prickling from the blaze.
