Thomas Muller has revealed that Manchester United made a bid to sign him this summer - before he decided to sign a new long-term deal with Bayern Munich.

The World Cup-winning forward said foreign clubs were offering him 'astronomical' sums to move away from the Bundesliga champions.

But he decided to stay in Bavaria, signing a five-year contract extension.

Muller, who scored 26 goals for Bayern last season and five for Germany at the World Cup, has spoken for the first time about the interest in him.

When asked by German newspaper Bild if United came close to signing him, he replied: 'Of course.

'I was aware that I could earn more by making that transfer.

'The amount that foreign clubs were offering me was astronomical. But Bayern are my club, a change was not an issue for me.'

Despite the German star's claims, a Manchester United spokesman said: 'It is not true that we made offers for either Muller or Reus at any stage.'
