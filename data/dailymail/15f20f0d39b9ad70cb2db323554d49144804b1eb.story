Employers across the US are cutting hours for workers in order to avoid paying for their health insurance.

Under the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, companies with more than 50 employees are required to offer health insurance to staff working over 30 hours per week.

This will hit low-paid workers on hourly wages the hardest as they fear smaller pay checks, as well as higher health premiums.

Forever 21-hours: The clothing chain announced that it will make cuts to benefits and pay for hundreds of its employees in a staff memo leaked in August to keep them under the 30-hour mark

As several companies deny that the new legislation has been a factor in their decision to cut hours, many workers now fear a double hit on both pay and benefits.

The legislation, said to be behind today's government shutdown, will see companies face a fine of $2,000 per full-time employee lest they pay for their health cover.

The Affordable Care Act, a health reform commonly referred to as Obamacare, opens for enrollment today and comes into force on January, 2014.

As a result, many companies are looking for a way to avoid both health payments and fines and have simply slashed hours for their employees.

These include international high-street clothing brand Forever 21, which will cut hours for hundreds of their employees according to a leaked staff memo, and grocery chain Trader Joe's which will cut benefits for all employees working less than 30 hours a week, replacing it with a $500 check to pay for coverage.

Financial nightmare: President Obama announces the government shutdown caused by the Senate and the House failing to agree on the health care reforms

‘Depending on income earned outside of Trader Joe’s, we believe that with the $500 from Trader Joe’s and the tax credits available under the ACA, many crew members should be able to obtain health care coverage at very little, if any, net cost,’ the 400-store chain said in a statement last month.

Other companies cutting hours and benefits include tourist favourite SeaWorld, logistics giant UPS and multi-national computer firm IBM which announced it will end their health plan for over 100,000 retiring employees.

Smaller businesses are following in their footsteps with 50 per cent admitting that they will cut the number of full-time employees or reduce their hours in order to avoid paying for health insurance.

In a July survey from the U.S. Chamber of commerce, only 30 per cent of small businesses said they were prepared for Obamacare, LA Times reported.

As a result of the ACA, about 27 per cent of small businesses intend to cut hours to reduce full-time employees and 23 per cent plan to replace them will part-time workers.

In addition, 24 per cent will reduce the number of staff hired, saying the healthcare bill is their biggest obstacle to hiring more employees, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said.

The Democrat heavy Senate’s battle against the Republican majority House of Representatives resulted in a standoff which led to a government shut-down at midnight on Tuesday.

Lawmakers in the Democrat-controlled Senate and Republican-controlled Congress failed to pass a budget allowing for the federal government to continue to be funded as it headed into the new fiscal year at midnight.

Late-night negotiations ended in deadlock after the Senate Democrats refused to consider any version of the budget that included changes to President Obama's signature health care law.

This lack of compromise means that nearly a million federal workers will go on unpaid leave until the two legislative bodies come to an agreement.
