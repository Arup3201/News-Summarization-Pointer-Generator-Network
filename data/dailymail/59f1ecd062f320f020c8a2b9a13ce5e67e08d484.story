It was a performance that was out of this world.

Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield has recorded a song with Barenaked Ladies singer Ed Robertson from 250 miles above planet Earth aboard the International Space Station.

'I.S.S (Is Somebody Singing?)' is the first track ever to be written and recorded in space.

The astronaut's performance was transmitted via satellite where it was mixed at a studio in Toronto

The pair wrote it together before the collaboration was recorded via satellite at a studio in Toronto.

Chris Hadfield's singing and guitar 
playing was piped through from the space station as it travels through 
the cosmos at 17,500 miles per hour (five miles per second).

Back on Earth, the Wexford Gleeks choir, from Wexford School for Arts, sang alongside Ed Robertson in the studio.

'We’ve been pals for a long time and it just seemed like a fun thing to do,' Robertson told CBC Music, the digital music streaming service behind the project.

'Chris and his brother write songs and they’re really great, so he’s going to record a bunch of stuff up there.

'The song we wrote together, I guess someone heard it and loved it, so before it was even finished we were asked to do this premiere.'

The 42-year-old envisioned he would have to do the lion's share of the writing - but in fact Commander Hadfield turned out to be a talented lyricist.

'I wrote the first verse and chorus, 
sent it to him, and asked for some technical jargon for the second verse
because the first verse was emotional,' said Robertson.

'I asked him to
be on the lookout for speeds and weights and a number of revolutions, 
serial numbers - anything we can use to put some technical data into this
song.

'After about a day and a half he sent me the second verse, and it 
was poetic and good. I was just like, 'Dude you are a high-functioning 
individual.' You are in Russia training to command the I.S.S. and in 
your free time you wrote the second verse of this song.'

Commander Hadfield now plans to record an entire album while in space.
