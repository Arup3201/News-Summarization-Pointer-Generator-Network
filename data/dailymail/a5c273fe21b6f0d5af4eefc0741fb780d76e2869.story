A plane-load of Alaskan schoolgirls were left fearing for their lives after the landing gear on their damaged aircraft buckled after it touched down on a frozen airfield.

The small propeller plane, carrying the volleyball team for Kolinganek school near Dillingham, southwestern Alaska, skidded 1,000ft down the runway, with sparks flying, before coming to a halt.

The twin-engine Piper Navajo craft, which was taking the team to Anchorage for a tournament, broke the landing gear on its left side upon take-off, trapping the pilot and passengers airborne in the damaged plane.

Emergency landing: The twin-propeller plane had broken landing gear, which failed during a landing at King Salmon airport in Alaska

Broken gear: The plane's left wheel, which hit a mud bank during take-off from a bad runway, failed to retract in flight, and didn't hold out when the plane landed

Its wheels hit a mud bank on the bumpy runway when the plane took off from remote Kolinganek airport, and wouldn't retract when the pilot tried to move them, the Alaska Dispatch News reported.

A tense journey followed in which the plane headed for a neighboring airport so ground crew could assess the damage as the aircraft flew overhead.

After officials saw the landing gear hanging off the plane at a dangerous angle, the pilot chose to fly half an hour southwest to King Salmon, because they could deal better with a potential crash.

The pilot, Brenten Goodrich, told the girls, their parents and support staff on board to brace before the landing, as he was certain the landing gear would buckle.

Melinda Merlino, a setter on the team, told local news station KTUU: 'It was really scary because we never experience this before - we were all nervous about what would happen.' 

Keeping on: The volleyball team, pictured above, were able to play their matches after continuing to Anchorage

When the plane touched down, the wheels held for a few seconds, but the then plane tilted, starting on its lengthy ski down the runway as fire trucks and ambulances raced towards the downed plane.

Nobody was hurt in the accident, potentially because the smooth, icy runway meant the plane could slide smoothly rather than coming to a rough stop.

The team members were then flown on to Anchorage and were able to compete as planned.

Assistant coach Anastasia Ishnook said: 'Our girls are really strong. They kept it together.

'The pilot was really nice. He said he was sorry it happened today but he couldn’t have had better passengers.'
