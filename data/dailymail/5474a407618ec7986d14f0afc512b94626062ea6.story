A former cub scout says he was sexually assaulted as a nine-year-old by Jimmy Savile after appearing on a show with the TV star.

Kevin Cook, the presenter’s youngest alleged victim, said he was lured to a dressing room with the promise of receiving a Jim’ll Fix It badge after appearing on the programme.

The 45-year-old, now a married father-of-two, described how Savile asked him whether he was ready to 'earn your badge' before molesting him and then getting him to touch him through his trousers.

The presenter then issued a chilling 
threat not to tell anyone about the abuse – and that no one would 
believe him over the word of 'King Jimmy' – before letting him go.

Mr Cook appeared on the show in 1976 
with members of the 44th Newham East cub pack. He told the Mail 
yesterday that Savile offered him a badge.

'He took me to a small dressing room. 
He said "Do you want to earn your badge?" and he sat me on a chair in 
the middle of the room.

'He put his hand on my knee and then 
tried to put his fingers up the bottom of my shorts before he unzipped 
them and touched me. Then he made me put my hand on top of his 
trousers.’

Mr Cook, who lives in an Essex coastal
town, came forward when he read about the Savile scandal. Details of 
his allegations have been passed to the Metropolitan Police.

‘Before I went on the programme Jimmy Savile was like a god. When we found out we were going on we were so excited,’ Mr Cook told the Mail today.

‘Now I feel angry and bitter that he 
is no longer here because if I had told someone what had happened he 
would have gone to prison.’

Only
eight of the 30 or 40 children who went to the famous race track were 
chosen to appear in the BBC’s White City studio later the same day.

Mr 
Cook, a welder, believes he was picked after presenting Savile with a 
gift – a tie his mother had bought.

Savile allegedly pounced when he saw how the schoolboy was crestfallen that a badge with a giant ribbon was handed to the entire pack.

‘I must have looked disappointed because Jimmy said “Would you like one of your own?” I said yes please,’ he said.

‘He took me to a small dressing room. I don’t think it was his because it was really shabby, a dingy little room.

‘He said “Do you want to earn your badge?” and he sat me on a chair in the middle of the room.

‘He put his hand on my knee and then tried to put his fingers up the bottom of my shorts before he unzipped them and touched me. Then he made me put my hand on top of his trousers.

‘There was a knock at the door and someone came in but said “Oops” and left. In hindsight, I think he [Savile] knew what he was doing and stood between me and the door so that no one would see what he was doing.’

He added: ‘After I’d done my shorts up Jimmy warned me not to tell anyone. He said “Don’t even tell your mates. We know where you live. Nobody would believe you anyway – I’m King Jimmy”.’

Mr Cook, who lives in an Essex coastal town, said he felt sick as he watched the programme with his parents and was no longer a ‘popular, outgoing kid’ after his ordeal.

Mr Cook came forward when he recently read about the allegations surfacing against the former Top of the Pops presenter and his wife noticed he was acting strangely

He only came forward when he recently read about the allegations surfacing against the former Top of the Pops presenter and his wife noticed he was acting strangely.

After hearing what had happened, she telephoned Essex Police and made him speak to them. Details have now been passed to the Metropolitan Police.

Mr Cook said: ‘All I feel is hatred for that man. I wish he was still alive to face up to what he’s done.’

A source at the Metropolitan Police said Mr Cook’s allegations were one of the lines of enquiry being looked into.

A spokesman said: ‘We’re not discussing individual cases.’

Mr Cook is one of several alleged male victims of the star to have come forward.

One man said he was abused at the age of 10 at the Haut de la Garenne children's home in Jersey.

And John Gibbin, now 49, claims Savile fondled him in his Rolls-Royce at a Stoke Mandeville hospital fundraiser when he was nine.

Another hospital where Savile allegedly abused patients was Broadmoor, a high-security psychiatric hospital in Berkshire.

Scotland Yard detectives are due to visit the hospital to gather new evidence about the claims.

The news comes as BBC Radio Two presenter Jeremy Vine has said he believes Savile will become known as 'one of the most serious predatory paedophiles in criminal history.'

Speaking at Cheltenham Literature Festival, Jeremy said that as a dad of two young daughters he finds Savile's actions 'completely disgusting.'

The veteran presenter, who has worked on the Newsnight programme had been asked by one of the audience: 'If you had been in charge of Newsnight last year what would you have done with the Jimmy Savile story?

Jeremy replied: 'This is a complete and utter nightmare.

'The fact that a person was using his BBC prestige and maybe even BBC dressing rooms to attack young children I find completely disgusting as a father of two young daughters.

'I cannot believe that it happened for such a sustained period that we may be looking at one of the most serious predatory paedophiles in criminal history - and he was on our doorstep. I find it disgusting.'

Culture Secretary Maria Miller will answer an urgent question in the Commons this afternoon about the BBC’s investigation into Savile, officials confirmed.

Meanwhile, a Tory MP has called for the removal of all references to Savile in public places and for him to be moved to an anonymous grave.

Alec Shelbrooke, MP for Elmet and Rothwell, said in a series of posts on Twitter that anyone 'found wanting' by a full, independent investigation should be prosecuted 'no matter how famous' they are.

The calls come amid fresh allegations Savile paid to cover up alleged sex attacks on underage girls while manager of a dance hall in the 1950s.

Former doorman Dennis Lemmon, 80, who was a door supervisor at the Mecca Locarno Ballroom in Leeds during the late 1950s while Savile was manager, said he was told he 'paid off' families to escape criminal charges of interfering with young girls.

Mr Lemmon, who was regularly requested to accompany Savile on his walkabouts around the dance hall, said he would always take an interest in chatting to young girls.

He said: 'The first inkling I got of it was when I was told he was going to be up in court.

'After that I got told he paid them off. I assumed it was the families. Before that there had been no rumours about him.'

An NSPCC spokesman said: 'It’s vital for all victims of sexual abuse to come forward to offer information or seek help, no matter when the offence was committed or who the offender was.'

Disgraced Jimmy Savile's best friend and personal assistant Janet Cope, 70

Jimmy Savile's best friend and his personal assistant for nearly 30 years has suggested numerous alleged child abuse victims are making the claims up.

Janet Cope, 70, refused to accept the former DJ was guilty of any of the sexual abuse claims and suggested alleged victims were motivated by money.

Speaking at her home in Aylesbury, Bucks, she told The Daily Star: 'Why have all these people shut up for 40 years? I 
just think they are jumping on the bandwagon. I think they know what 
money is.'

Mrs Cope, who was given away by Savile at her wedding in 1990, added: 'You know people suddenly become fanciful when something like this happens.

'They think, "Oh, I'll have a little bit of this, I'll say I was groped
or something", when all that happened was he put his arm around you and
had a photograph taken.'

She met Savile while doing charity work at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 1971, the hospital where it is claimed Savile abused young children.

She suggested to the newspaper that the reason Savile was often pictured with young women was because he thought it would help preserve his youthful image.

She added: 'These kids thrown themselves at celebrities, the celebrities don't go looking for it.'
