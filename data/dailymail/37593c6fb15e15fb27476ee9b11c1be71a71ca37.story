An Alabama father has been united with his long-lost daughter after believing she was dead for almost half a century.

Charles Lutzow, from Rockford, and his heavily pregnant wife, Stella, separated for two months in 1967. When they got back together, Stella had delivered the baby and told her husband the child had died during child birth.

In fact, she had given the perfectly healthy little girl up for adoption without telling him.

Stella took her secret to her grave a decade ago, but in December the couple's daughter, Keri Abercrombie tracked her biological father down.

The 45-year-old met her extended family for the first time this week, and the heartwarming moment was captured by WIFR.

'I can't even put into words I'm so excited,' Abercrombie told the station, as her overjoyed father embraced her.

'I believed she was dead all this time,' Lutzow added.

The woman found her father's details through the Adoption Registry and Facebook.

Back together: Lutzow and Abercombie are both thrilled to be united after so long

After mulling it over for months, she 
eventually took a chance and reached out to her biological brother 
online to explain who she was.

'I told him "I think I'm your sister" and he's like "what, sister?"'

She then made an emotional phone call.

'I called (my father) and said "hey, I found you, you're my daddy,"' Abercrombie said on Tuesday, as she met other family members.

'I didn't know who the hell it was,' Lutzow added.

Abercrombie grew up in Utah with loving adoptive parents and now lives in Alabama. She actually moved to Rockford with her family in 1985 to attend her senior year of high school.

She said she always new she was adopted.

Abercrombie posted about the momentous occasion on Facebook.

'Come to find out that I have a whole family out there,' Abercrombie wrote on Tuesday.

'I was blessed to have the most wonderful adopted parents. I would like to give the glory to God, for finding me my birth family.'

Lutzow is equally thrilled at the discovery, which came so late in life.

'We've been apart 45 years, now finally back together, it's a god-send,' Lutzow told WIFR.
