Marouane Chamakh is certainly enjoying his time away from the pitch as the Crystal Palace striker was spotted on a night out in London with Playboy twins Carla and Melissa Howe.

The 30-year-old headed to Chinawhite near Oxford Circus with the Playboy bunnies before heading on to a second club, Beat.

Former Arsenal forward Chamakh missed Sunday's 4-0 victory at Dover in the FA Cup third round as he continued his recovery from a hamstring injury.

Due to injuries Chamakh hasn't featured for Crystal Palace since December 13 and missed the crucial festive programme.

But life away from the field appears to be good if the pictures of his night out are anything to go by.

The Playboy twins were born in Berkshire but now divide their time between London and Hollywood, pursuing careers in modelling and acting.

The 24-year-olds have appeared in music videos, magazine shoots and starred alongside Snoop Dogg in High School Movie.

Chamakh's career hasn't taken off in England since arriving at Arsenal in 2010. He has scored one goal in all competitions this season, against West Ham in August, but may have the chance to regain his form and fitness under new Eagles manager Alan Pardew.

Palace need all their strikers firing as they're in the bottom three of the Premier League and host high-flying Tottenham this Saturday.
