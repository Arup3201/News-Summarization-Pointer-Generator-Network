This is just one of the incredible light trail photos taken by Dan Arkle in Derbyshire's beautiful Peak District.

Mr Arkle, from Sheffield, took anywhere between 10 minutes and an hour to produce the pictures, which are created by using a long exposure photo and a head torch.

The 34-year-old, who also climbed Tryfan, in Snowdonia, Wales, had to endure freezing temperatures while navigating a course along treacherous rock, using only the minimal light available.

During one climb, he had to complete the ascent on his own and without ropes.

And on a landmark known as Higgar Tor, he had to climb the Peak District rock by painfully jamming his hands into cracks.

He said: 'I got to the top of the first climb, where the rock was covered with ice.

'As I was climbing solo and ropeless, this gave me a few scary moments until I found a way round - the climbs are around 60ft high.

'Climbing was strenuous and a little painful, but keeping my hands in the cracks also means that I felt secure.

'There was no danger of slipping off unexpectedly but I knew I would have to get to the top before I got too tired or my hands got too cold.'

Mr Arkle prides himself on his ability to capture star trails within his amazing photographs.

He said: 'The star trails in the sky are formed when the stars appear to move in the sky due to Earth spinning on its axis, just as the sun does.

'As the North Star - Polaris - is above the North Pole, it appears stationary and the other stars seem to move round it.

Dan Arkle (pictured), 34,  plans to continue to make light trails and hopes to take his talent overseas. He has also created an incredible 'little planet' set of pictures by taking a panorama photo and then warping it and manipulating it in Photoshop - including Burbage South Boulders, near Hathersage, Derbyshire (right)

'Any exposure of longer than a few seconds will result in some star movement being captured.

'Also notice that the colours of the 
stars are different. We don’t normally see this as our eyes can’t see 
well in colour when it is very dim.'

The experimental photographer had previously created an incredible 'little planet' set of pictures by taking a panorama photo and then warping it and manipulating it in Photoshop.

For that project, he captured amazing scenes in the Italian Dolomites, the Swiss Alps and places closer to home, such as tors in Derbyshire, and Ben Nevis.
