Brendan Rodgers has signed a new long-term contract after Liverpool’s owners promised he will be given every help to make the club champions.

Rodgers, who was named LMA Manager of the Year after he took Liverpool to within two points of the title last season, completed the formalities of signing a deal on Monday and the improved terms, which are believed to run to 2018, reflect his outstanding work.

Personal gain, however, is not his motivation and the main crux of negotiations with Fenway Sports Group – who described Rodgers as a 'hugely talented individual' – stemmed around boosting a squad that will have the added demands next year of a Champions League campaign.

Liverpool have identified a number of targets, headed by Adam Lallana. Negotiations continue for the England midfielder, who has his heart set on a move to Anfield, but they are taking time because Southampton are looking to command £30milllion.

Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri is an alternative to Lallana, while Liverpool are working on a deal to sign Emre Can, the £12million-rated Germany Under 21 midfielder, who was at Bayer Leverkusen last season.

Rodgers says FSG’s support heading into the transfer window is crucial.

‘I came 
here because I felt that this is one of the biggest clubs in the world,’ he explained. ‘I want to be here as long as I can, hopefully 
playing a part in building and restoring a club to its greatness. I 
think we’ve really rediscovered the soul of Liverpool in particular this
 season.

‘So I’ve got absolutely no interest in being anywhere else. But I also needed to know it’s going to be right because I want to succeed. I want to win and I need to know that if I am going to be here I’m going to have the best possibility to win.

‘I need to know that this is an idea and a way of working that’s set up to win; it’s not just to look good. And I need to know that I can have players that can carry out the instructions that we want to work to win trophies. The owners have been great. They’re winners themselves. They want to win.

‘But we want to work it in a way that makes the club sustainable and I think we’ve clearly shown that it’s about the top quality but it’s also about being strategic in those signings as well, bringing in the right players. It’s key for me that I can speak to the owners like that.’

Liverpool had difficulties attracting the players Rodgers had targeted 12 months ago – Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Diego Costa and Willian – because they were unable to offer Champions League football but he is convinced the forthcoming window will be different.

‘The best players want to play in the big competition,’ Rodgers said. ‘That’s the fight and I certainly found that last summer but we’ve put Liverpool back on the map now. Everyone sees that we’re going to be a threat; that we’re going to go into Europe next year and we’ll have no fear.

‘We need to pay attention in terms of the teams we’ll be playing against, but we’ll have no fear. That’s what top players want – they want to play in teams where they can show their talents.’

Crucial: Rodgers said it was vital that he had the support of the Liverpool board in the transfer market
