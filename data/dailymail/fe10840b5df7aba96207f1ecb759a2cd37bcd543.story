She replaced Katie Holmes as the face of Bobbi Brown earlier this year and Kate Upton is really proving her worth as the brand's covergirl.

The 22-year-old model, whose famous curves made her a household name, has been unveiled as the face of the new Scotch On The Rocks campaign.

Looking sultry with deep red lips, smokey eyes and pinched cheeks, Kate is the perfect advert for the new collection.

Smouldering: Kate Upton is the perfect poser girl for Bobbi Brown's latest beauty range, which includes all the products you need to create a party look

The range, which is inspired by American actress Lauren Bacall, is full of all the products you need to create party-ready looks, say the brand. 

'This collection is a gorgeous combination of sexy, strong and confident. The look starts with skin, which has the subtlest warmed-by-the-fireside glow,' said Bobbi of the new collection.

Get the glow: The range, which is inspired by American actress Lauren Bacall, is full shimmery products such as the warm glow eye palette, £59, and the highlight powder, £34, to create the perfect winter glow

'To make eyes sparkle, it's all about warm matte browns, golden metallic nudes and deep ambers for a rich, sultry effect. For lips, it's all about options - from soft beige to bold bordeaux.'

The glitzy new range forms part of Bobbi's Christmas gifting collection and hits stores in November so you can get Kate's festive beauty look.

After conquering the fashion and beauty world, the in-demand star appears to have her eyes set on Hollywood following her role in the romantic comedy The Other Woman earlier this year.

With her career soaring to new heights, her relationship with Justin Verlander, 33, also appears to be in great shape following a rocky start.

The couple first started dating in January 2013 but split soon after with Kate going on to date Dancing With The Stars pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy for six months until ending it in December.

The baseballer and the beauty then quickly reunited and were spotted together at the beginning of this year and it's been smooth sailing ever since.
