He is the judge who thinks  burglars are ‘courageous’ – an opinion which earned him an official reprimand for damaging public confidence in the courts.

Now Peter Bowers is at the centre of another controversy, this time for letting a convicted paedophile skip jail because he thought he ‘would suffer very badly’ in prison.

In a move which has outraged campaigners for victims of child abuse, the judge allowed 24-year-old child-porn addict Mark Martin to walk free, despite the fact that he is a repeat offender.

Martin was caught for the second time 
with a catalogue of hardcore indecent images of young boys and girls on 
his mobile phone – a crime which even he admitted he ‘fully expected’ to
go prison for.

But Judge Bowers gave him a suspended 
sentence – the second Martin has received – because he feared he 
wouldn’t ‘cope’ with jail.

Judge Bowers told Martin: ‘I have read
with some concern about you, and this addiction you have had of looking
at pornography of little children.

‘I think you would suffer very badly in prison and I don’t think, at the moment, it is necessary to send you there today.

Peter Bowers, 67, a married father-of-three, has been no stranger to controversy in his 20-year career as a judge.

Three years ago, he allowed a violent thug to walk free from court despite admitting that the public think judges are 'going mad' for passing soft sentences.

In another case, he told a man who led police on a ten-mile car chase after trying to kill himself: 'Next time you want to commit suicide find somewhere quiet to do it.'

More recently, he has made contradictory comments about burglary sentencing.

In May last year, he criticised sentencing guidelines that let first-time burglars escape with a 'slap across the wrist'.

But weeks later, he allowed a man with almost 80 crimes on his record to walk free for a burglary committed four days after his release from prison, telling the court: ‘I must be getting soft in my old age.’

‘I am going to give you another 
suspended sentence, but you have got to understand it is the very last 
chance you are ever going to get.’

In September last year, Judge Bowers 
caused public outrage for praising the ‘courage’ of serial burglar 
Richard Rochford, 26, and letting him off with a suspended sentence.

He told him: ‘It takes a huge amount 
of courage, as far as I can see, for somebody to burgle somebody’s 
house. I wouldn’t have the nerve.’

He was criticised for his choice of words, which were branded a ‘serious error of judgment’.

Following an investigation, the Lord 
Chancellor Chris Grayling and Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge upheld 
complaints about the comments and issued  Judge Bowers with a reprimand 
for his remarks which had ‘damaged public confidence in the judicial 
process’.

In the latest case, he was presented 
with Martin, from Hartlepool, who had been already let off by a court 
after being caught with child porn in 2009.

He was handed an eight-month prison 
sentence, suspended for two years, which allowed him to walk free as 
long as he did not offend again during the supervision period.

He was told to go on a sex offenders’ 
treatment programme to cure his ‘addiction’ and had to allow police 
officers access to his computer. Then last week, Teesside Crown Court 
heard how police visited his home in February last year to check on his 
internet activity on his computer and mobile phone.

Prosecutor Sue Jacobs told the court 
that a total of 48 still and moving images of child abuse – some in the 
worst category – were found on his phone.

Although he was caught for a second 
time after his first sentence had run its course, police could tell from
the image files that some had been downloaded within the two-year time 
frame of the initial suspended sentence. Judge Bowers told him: ‘You 
present quite a problem for me because, in theory, you had breached the 
suspended sentence.

‘As most people will know, if  people 
do breach a suspended sentence, then it is almost inevitable they go 
straight away to prison.’

But in a highly unusual move, Judge 
Bowers then imposed a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, 
with probation service supervision.

The National Association of People Abused in Childhood last night described the sentence as ‘strange by any standards’.

Dr Jon Bird, from the charity, said: 
‘This is remarkably short-sighted, in my opinion. In prison this kind of
offender would be segregated for his protection.

‘I imagine he is at home laughing about how he fooled a judge.

‘There has to be a strong deterrent enforced on these criminals who cause so much pain to their victims.’

Yesterday, Martin said outside his flat: ‘Obviously I didn’t want to go to prison but I went to court fully expecting to.

‘He said I couldn’t have coped in prison but this is my definite last chance.

‘I have definitely learned my  lesson and won’t do it again.’
