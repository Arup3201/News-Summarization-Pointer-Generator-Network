Several exclusive golf clubs in New York wouldn't let President Barack Obama play on their courses on Labor Day weekend, it emerged on Wednesday.

The Trump National Golf Club, the Winged Foot Golf Club and the Willow Ridge Country Club all turned down Obama, NBC 4 New York reports.

The news station says the president's advance team gave courses only a day or two of notice that Obama would be in the area, and clubs may have rejected the White House's request to protect their wealthy members from being inconvenienced during the holiday weekend.

Membership dues at the swanky golf clubs run upward of $100,000 a year.

NBC 4 says it learned of the president's golf plans from sources who were informed of the calls made by Obama's advance staff. 

The news station says it reached out to the clubs that were approached, but they declined to comment.

The president was in New York on the weekend in question, and he was scheduled to overnight in West Chester Country on Friday after headlining a fundraisers in Rhode Island and New York earlier that day.

The following evening Obama was to attend the nearby wedding of White House chef Sam Kass and MSNBC host Alex Wagner at Blue Hill Farm in Pocantico Hills.

Obama had no other public events on his schedule Saturday.

The day before the trip, Obama's chief spokesman said the president wouldn't be staying the night in New York after all and would instead return to the White House on Friday after his speaking engagements. 

Obama had planned to overnight in New York that Friday after headlining fundraisers so that he could attend the nearby wedding of a White House aide and family friend the following day. Instead, he came back to the White House on Friday and traveled to New York again on Saturday with his family for the wedding

'He can sleep in his own bed, do a little work tomorrow, spend some time with his family and then travel back to New York tomorrow evening to attend a private event,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said.

The president and his family indeed made a separate trip to New York for the Kass-Wagner wedding on Saturday evening.

Obama ended up golfing at his customary course on the grounds of the Fort Belvoir military installation in Virginia the next day.
