Wrongly accused: José García has been extradited from Texas to Miami twice for crimes he did not commit 30 years ago because he shares the same name and birth date as the accused

A Texas truck driver has been arrested and tried TWICE for a crime he did not commit because he shares the same name and birth date as the wanted man.

José García has been extradited on both occasions from his home in the southern state to a jail cell in Miami, where he has been locked up before eventually facing a judge.

Mr García, who lost his job in both incidences, is now trying to recover his losses and is outraged that the police and the judiciary could make the same mistake twice.

Speaking to the Miami Herald, he said: 'It shouldn't happen twice; it shouldn't even happen at all - never, ever.'

While Mr García's criminal record is not exactly spotless, it was his previous conviction for a rape charge which was evidence that he did  not commit an armed robbery and kidnapping 30 years ago.

At the time of the alleged crime, which took place in Kendall, Florida on Christmas Day in 1983, Mr García was serving a six-year jail term for his sex crime.

But in 2008, the truck driver was picked up by police at his Texas home, and flown to South Florida, where he spent two months in jail.

He eventually proved his innocence with his previous prison record, and the courts let Mr García walk free.

Having lost his job once for a crime he did not commit, Mr García was shocked to be arrested and extradited a second time for the same crime.

Local police in Texas, in southern Cameron County, found an old arrest warrant for Mr García from before his 2008 case, and contacted Miami-Dade Police Department.

Since back then they thought this was the man they were looking for, the mug-shot, finger prints as well as name and date of birth all matched the old warrant.

Texas police looked into Mr García's file while he was serving a five-day sentence for drink driving.

After he finished serving his driving while intoxicated (DWI) jail term, he was sent back to his prison cell - for another month - to await extradition back to Florida.

Flabbergasted he was being arrested again for the same kidnapping case, Mr García told them: 'You're the ones kidnapping me.'

After
showing the Texas police officers his court order from 2008 proving his
innocence, he told the US paper: 'They just looked at each other. They 
told me there was nothing they could do.'

Evidence: Footage from the court video shows how Mr Garcia, holding out his court order letter, explained to the Miami judge that his was not the man they were looking for. The judge appeared baffled

After a month being held in the Texas cell, officers from Miami came to fly him handcuffed to Florida, to face another judge the next day.

When he was brought before the court, Mr García once again presented his court order as evidence of his innocence.

A baffled judge questioned the situation with Mr García's attorney before ordering his release.

The police in Florida claimed the truck driver 'failed to inform anyone that this was a case of mistaken identity' - something refuted by Mr García.

Law enforcement authorities in Texas said he presented them with the evidence, but Miami-Dade Police Department said they still wanted him arrested.

Katherine Fernandez Rundle, Miami-Dade State Attorney told the paper: 'If an innocent person is charged with a crime, a guilty person walks free. Neither situation should ever happen.'

Hopefully, now, however, Mr García will never again face the courts for the same crime, after the police placed an alert against his name, locally and nationally, indicating that he is not the man wanted for the 1983 kidnapping.
