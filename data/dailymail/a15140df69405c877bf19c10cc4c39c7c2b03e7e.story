At first, the funeral procession looks like that of any other much-loved relative, adorned with flower arrangements spelling out 'dad' and 'uncle'.

But the final one gives some hint that this is not a usual funeral: for the '240DC' is believed to be a knowing wink to notorious London gangster Charlie Richardson's favoured method of torture - electrocuting the bodies of those who had crossed him.

Many gangsters from the past reared their heads to pay their respects to the man who was once one of the most feared criminals in the capital, whose empire embraced fraud, gambling, protection 
rackets - and torture.

Put to rest: Charlie was the leader of the Richardson gang (also known as the Torture gang) from Camberwell

'Mad' Frankie Fraser, Kray associate Chris Lambrianou, and Charlie's brother Eddie Richardson were seen, along with many 'of the great and the good' of the 1960s.

Mad Frankie, so-called for his preference for pulling teeth with pliers, made his way into the Camberwell New Cemetery.

Chris Lambrianou, convicted for his involvement of the 1967 murder of Jack ‘The Hat’ McVitie, also came to pay his respects.

Lambrianoi was convicted for his role
in disposing of the body, spending more than 15 years in prison and 
finding God while he was inside.

Eddie Richardson was there - but witnesses say he did not enter the church.

The brothers are believed to have 
fallen out several years ago over money, and Eddie said he had not 
spoken to his brother since then.

Also present was Charlie's wife Ronnie, 
wrapped in a fur-lined shawl, watching as the procession made its way to
the cemetery, guided by the same funeral director who presided over 
Jade Goody's funeral in 2009.

Charlie Richardson died last month - 
the 78-year-old heavy smoker finally succumbing to blood poisoning 
following gall bladder complaints.

His funeral procession, bedecked in flowers as it slowly drove down the A20, remembered him as a 'dad', and an 'uncle'.

But the legends that surround him paint a very different picture.

He was arrested on 
the day England won the World Cup in 1966. His trial heard he was 
alleged to have used iron bars, pliers and electrodes on anyone who 
crossed him.

Notoriety: Richardson, pictured in 2007, was thought to have earned millions through his notorious gang's operations but left an estate worth just £21,000

The 
Camberwell-born crime lord was found guilty of fraud, extortion, assault
and grievous bodily harm, and was jailed for 25 years.

Together with his brother Eddie, he was as infamous as Ronnie and Reggie Kray and ‘Mad’ Frankie Fraser.

Known
as the ‘Torture Gang’, their trademark was pinning victims to the floor
with six-inch nails and removing their fingers and toes with bolt 
cutters.

The Richardson Gang
were also known for torturing enemies at their scrap metal yard by 
attaching electrodes to their nipples and genitals and delivering 
electric shocks, having already placed them in baths of water to make 
the electricity more potent.

The
gang would frequently carry out mock trials for victims, before 
administering punishments including whippings, cigarette burning and 
teeth being pulled out by gang member 'Mad' Frankie Fraser.

They were then made to clean up their own blood.

The
brutal method of trial by kangaroo court and subsequent torture was 
said to be known as 'taking a shirt from Charlie', as Richardson would 
often give victims a clean shirt in which to return home afterwards.

The coffin was carried into the chapel to the strains of Stand by Me by Ben E King.

The service included a poem by his second wife, Ronnie, which said: ‘Many have judged him over the years, some good, some bad and said they feared.

‘But they never knew this incredible man. A legend, a father – not gangland!’ Mourners left the chapel to the sound of My Way by Frank Sinatra.

Afterwards, one said: ‘There’s not many of them left now. The Krays are dead and now Charlie. Frankie’s about the only one still going. It’s a changing world.’

Following his release from prison in 1984, Richardson sought to become a legitimate businessman, wrote his autobiography My Manor and had a cameo in a film of his life.

Pallbearers, believed to be Charlie's grandsons, carry the coffin into the church in New Camberwell

In loving memory: The programme carried the phrase - 'In celebration of Charlie's life looking back in gratitude and love'

Charlie 
was two years older than his brother Eddie and six years older than 
their youngest sibling, Alan.

He and Eddie turned to a life of crime when the departure 
of their father left their family penniless.

Eddie Richardson, speaking just after
his brother's death, said: ‘I haven’t spoken to him in years so I am 
not the best person to 
speak to about his death. But he will be missed by his six children.

‘I can’t say he was a good father, but he was a father. He leaves a big family behind him.

‘Members of his family were with him in hospital. I’m sure they will be upset and disappointed, losing a dad is difficult.'

‘I lost count of how many grandchildren he had.

‘It
came as a surprise to some, but not to me. He had been ill for years 
and has suffered with breathing problems – emphysema – for a long time 
due to smoking.'

He also refused to get medical treatment for his stomach pain 
because he was scared of doctors, despite suffering in agony for weeks.

His
close friend David Fraser, son of Richardson Gang enforcer “Mad” 
Frankie Fraser, said: 'He kept putting off going to the doctors.

'When he finally went, he was admitted to hospital and never came out.'

He died in the arms of his wife, Ronnie.

Mr
Fraser, who spent time in prison with the ex-gang leader, added that 
his death came as a shock as he had been expecting to meet him for lunch
this week.

'He was in pain for a few weeks. Ronnie kept saying: "You have got to go to the doctor," but he was a typical man.'

Richardson always insisted the torture stories were just a myth and were simply used to help convict his gang.

He
added: ‘If you can find anyone who says they got nailed to the floor by
us or got their toes cut off I will give you £10,000 for each one.

'We were fitted up. I never touched a single toe. I did 18 years for nothing.’

The
Richardsons, along with 'Mad' Frankie Fraser and George Cornell, were 
the main rivals of twin brothers Ronald "Ronnie" Kray and Reginald 
"Reggie" Kray during the 1950s and '60s.

The
two rival sets of brothers controlled London, operating through armed 
robberies, arson, protection rackets, assaults and torture, with the 
Krays based in East London and the Richardson gang from South London, 
also entrenched in the West End.

Their turf war began after a brawl during a Christmas party at the Astor Club in December 1965.

It
was here that George Cornell, insulted Ronnie Kray, calling him a ‘fat 
poof’ after first meeting the Krays while in Shepton Mallet Prison.

Shortly
after the incident Cornell was seen walking down Whitechapel Road 
shouting: 'Where's that fat w*****?' referring to Ronnie Kray.

Ronnie Kray showed up at the Blind beggar pub where Cornell was drinking, and shot Cornell through the head at close range.

In
March 1966 a gun battle took place in a club called Mr Smiths in Rushey
Green with the Richardson gang going there with the intentions of 
wiping out the Krays.

However
there was only one member of the Kray gang present. He was shot dead. 
Frankie Fraser , a good friend of the Richardsons was shot in the hip 
and Eddie was shot in the backside.

They
were taken to hospital and on their release they were charged with 
affray and sentenced to 5 years in prison. Frankie Fraser was originally
charged with the murder of Dickie Hart but was found not guilty.

Other
notable characters in the Richardson gang included the notorious hit 
man Jimmy Moody, Roy Hall (who operated the electric generator), Albert 
Longman, and Tommy Clark.

Moody
was the main enforcer for the Richardsons, but also did 'freelance 
work' for the Krays and became one of the most feared criminals to 
emerge from the London underworld.

A
further member of the gang, Harry Beard, is known for frequently 
urinating on a collector of protection money, who was twice warned by 
the Richardsons after he pocketed the money.Another
infamous killing at the time was that of Jack "The Hat" McVitie, a 
minor member of the Kray’s gang, killed by Reggie Kray, in a move that 
eventually led to their convictions.
