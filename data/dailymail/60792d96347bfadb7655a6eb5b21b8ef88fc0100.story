NATO warplanes bombed a Libyan warship docked in Tripoli harbour after observing that weapons were being take from it that were expected to be used to conduct attacks, the alliance said today.

The Soviet-built Koni-class frigate was hit and badly damaged on the military side of the port of Tripoli, NATO military spokesman Colonel Roland Lavoie told a news briefing.  

'It became evident regime forces were removing weaponry and munitions from the warship with the intent of using them from other platforms,' he said.

NATO was concerned the arms could have been used against civilians, NATO forces, or ships delivering humanitarian aid.  

'The strikes were successful and they are expected to reduce the regime's ability to conduct hostile action,' Lavoie said.  

'The state of the frigate is not good. As of this morning, photos showed that it was quite damaged.

'I would conclude that it is very unlikely to present any threat in the future to the civilian population or to NATO forces.

NATO's air campaign and a sea blockade launched in March have kept Gaddafi's naval forces confined to harbour except for a few minor harassment missions.

However, two NATO warships did come under ineffective rocket fire from the coast last week.  

Colonel Gaddafi has ordered three days of mourning following the alleged death of many civilians

NATO said it destroyed several Libyan naval vessels in air strikes in May. Warships hit at that time included a Koni-class frigate and a Combattante class fast-attack ship.

The strike came on the same day that Libyan accused Nato of bombing civilians.

According to local reports the attack, which took place 150km - or 90 miles - east of the capital, led to at least three children dying.

The international agency have been trying to help the anti-regime rebels, who have been battling with Colonel Gaddafi's forces for five months, and have said they will investigate the claims.

Libyan state television showed footage of the charred bodies of at least three young children who, it alleged, were killed by a Nato strike last night on the village of Majar.

In addition, there were also video clips in which women and children - supposedly badly injured in the bombing - being treated in a hospital.     

State television did not provide a figure for the total number of people who had died or had been wounded.

However, the official Jana news agency insisted that '20 families' had been killed, though a precise figure was not forthcoming.

The state television said that the government of Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi have announced three days of mourning for the victims.   

Majar is situated near Zlitan, on Libya's Mediterranean coast, where Nato forces have been mounting attacks on government troops.               

An official from the organisation said the alliance hit a target in Zlitan last night but he could not say if it was in the same location where Libyan television reported casualties.           

'We have been chasing this (report) up,' the official said.

'We cannot confirm reports of civilian casualties but we would regret any loss of civilian life.

'Nato goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties, unlike the Gaddafi regime, which is deliberately targeting civilians.'
