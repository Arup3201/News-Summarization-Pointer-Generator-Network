GOLDENEYE: IAN FLEMING'S JAMAICA by Matthew Parkinson (Hutchinson £20) 

At the height of summer July 1943, Ian Fleming, then the assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence, flew to Jamaica with his old friend Ivar Bryce to investigate reports that a millionaire Swede — and Nazi sympathiser — had built a secret submarine base on the island.

Bryce came away convinced that the trip had been a disaster. They found no evidence of a base and it rained incessantly — so much so that toadstools grew in their shoes overnight.

Unbeknown to him, Fleming felt quite differently. He didn’t care about the rain or the toadstools in his shoes. He loved everything about Jamaica, especially its air of romantic decay.

As soon as the war was over, he asked Bryce — who knew the island well — to look for a plot of land where he could build a house.

Bryce found a 14-acre strip of coastline with a thin sliver of silver sand below. It was on sale for £2,000.

When he visited the site with the land agent, Bryce thought it had everything Fleming wanted. Gazing out to sea, he saw a beautiful local girl swimming. When she got out of the water, she was naked. That was the clincher.

‘He will adore this place,’ Bryce told the agent. ‘Tie it up tomorrow, Reggie.’

Bryce was right. Fleming was entranced. From the start, he had a very clear idea about what sort of house he wanted.

The most important thing was that it should be simple. There was to be no glass in the windows ‘so that the birds could fly through’, no cupboards, only coat hooks, and the bedrooms should be ‘insignificant and small’.

The finished house looked, according to Fleming’s friend Noel Coward, exactly like a medical centre, but Fleming didn’t care. Coward didn’t think much of the cooking either, claiming that the food ‘tasted of armpits’, but nothing could dent Fleming’s enthusiasm.

Shortly after moving into Goldeneye, he began work on what was to become the first James Bond novel, Casino Royale. The mixture of action and sensuality that Fleming found at Goldeneye — as he christened his new home — proved to be the rock upon which James Bond was built. But it wasn’t just that — Bond owed his very existence to the place. Fleming took his name from the ornithologist author of The Field Guide To Birds Of The West Indies. Fleming was a passionate ornithologist, and as Matthew Parker observes, anyone who kills a bird in a Bond story unleashes his fiercest wrath and always ends up dead.

Golden home: Tense, aloof and pretty unlikable in London, Fleming became far more easygoing as soon as he set foot in Jamaica (Goldeneye pictured)

Friends who visited Fleming noticed that he seemed quite different when he was at Goldeneye. Tense, aloof and pretty unlikable in London, he became far more easygoing as soon as he set foot in Jamaica.

In a sense he left his other life behind, at least temporarily, although it wasn’t long before trouble — women trouble in particular — followed him across the Atlantic.

For several years he had been having an affair with Ann Harmsworth, the wife of Viscount Rothermere, proprietor of the Mail. Rothermere, not altogether surprisingly, had become increasingly fed-up with his wife’s behaviour.

When she became pregnant — by Fleming — he decided he’d finally had enough and filed for divorce.

For an incorrigible philanderer like Fleming, this was a distinctly mixed blessing. He felt he had no alternative but to ask Ann to marry him, but did so in a spirit of deep foreboding.

She plainly had her doubts, too. Writing to Fleming from America while he was at Goldeneye, she begged him to try to stay faithful to her for three weeks just as an experiment. ‘You have never done it before and it might make you feel very happy.’ Like Bond, there was something distinctly misogynistic about Fleming’s philandering. The novelist, Rosamond Lehmann, once observed that he ‘got off with women because he could not get on with them’.

All this hardly boded well for their future together. On the day that Ann’s decree absolute came through, they were married in the local town hall, then went to Goldeneye for a wedding supper.

Again Noel Coward, one of the two witnesses, was appalled by the food — ‘the black crab tasted just like cigarette ash’.

But the cooking proved to be the least of their problems. Ann, it soon became clear, regarded James Bond as a bit of an embarrassment. She referred to Fleming’s books as ‘horror comics’ and ‘pornography’.

And then there was parenthood. When Ann gave birth to a son, Casper, the couple quickly grew bored of him — a nanny would bring him to see them before dinner, then a few minutes later take him away again.

Fleming’s drinking, always pretty heavy, became heavier still. His health began to suffer — doctors repeatedly told him to cut down on the booze and the cigarettes, but to no avail.

Then, just as Fleming was feeling his age, Bond took off.

The books got a huge boost in 1961 when President Kennedy — no slouch in the bedroom himself — named From Russia With Love as one of his favourite novels.

Not long before, Kennedy and Fleming had met. Over dinner, Kennedy asked him what James Bond would do about Fidel Castro, who had just seized power in Cuba.

Fleming, jokingly, said that Bond would slip something into his drink to make his beard fall out. Amazingly, the CIA took up his suggestion and worked on a plan to dust Castro’s shoes with thallium, a strong depilatory.

Three years later, Fleming was dead of a massive heart attack, at just 56. Subsequently, Goldeneye was bought by the record producer, Chris Blackwell, the son of a friend of Fleming’s, who did the place up and turned it into a swanky holiday let — Sting wrote Every Breath You Take there.

You might think there is nothing new to say about Ian Fleming — that every detail of his life has been obsessively picked over by biographers. Matthew Parker, though, has produced a book as illuminating as it is intriguing.

Written in a quick-fire, atmospheric, prose style that clearly owes something to Fleming’s own, it cracks along with all the urgency of a Bond novel.

An odd love story: Ian Fleming's relationship with his Jamaican home Goldeneye might  be the most fulfilling affair he ever had

As Parker shrewdly points out, in an odd sort of way this is a love story — albeit one between a man and a house. Yet it might just be the most fulfilling affair that Fleming ever had.

Parker’s just as insightful on our own love affair with Bond and what it tells us about ourselves. The books — and films — tap into our sense of national pride, as well as our tendency towards self-deprecation.

We know that Bond’s patriotism is absurd, and that he himself is absurd, but every time he bumps off another baddy or beds another woman, we can’t help raising an imaginary glass and murmuring: ‘Good on you, chum.’
