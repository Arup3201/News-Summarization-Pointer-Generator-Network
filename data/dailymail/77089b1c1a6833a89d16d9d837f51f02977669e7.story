This is the moment a ‘real-life superhero' takes on the ice bucket challenge before being tasered and falling into a pool of freezing water.

Phoenix Jones, aka Ben Fodor, who is leader of a Seattle-based Rain City Superhero Movement, uploaded a YouTube video showing his extreme take on the latest viral craze.

Clad in a gold and black costume, the self-styled crime fighter pledges to donate $100 to help the fight against Lou Gehrig's disease before being soaked in icy water.

Self-styled superhero Phoenix Jones, aka Ben Fodor, is seen having a bucket of icy water thrown over his head before being tasered 

Before the challenge, he told the camera: ‘Everything you can do, I can do it better. To win this challenge I’m going to do this challenge. But then I’m going to take it a step further and get tasered.

'I’m going to attempt to fight the tase and try and not fall back into this ice cold water.’

He fails in this mission after being overcome by the high-voltage weapon.

The 'real-life superhero' then says: ‘I’m good, I’m good, we’ve got the video. Cut the tape.’ 

He is the leader of a citizen patrol group that describes itself as a crime prevention brigade.

Before being drenched in icy water, Phoenix Jones tells the camera: ‘Everything you can do, I can do it better.'

The YouTube video has attracted more than 3,666 views and mainly positive comments.

Although some viewers have pointed out the dangers associated with being tasered, especially near water.

Julius Fawcett said: 'Be careful out there, our health is precious.'

Manufacturers recommend that tasers are not used near water because of the risk of drowning. 

Celebrities including Justin Timberlake, Mark Zuckerberg, TV presenter Jimmy Fallon, Emmy Rossum and Mickey Rourke have all taken the plunge in recent weeks.

Everyone who takes the challenge makes a donation to the ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) Foundation, which heads the fight against Lou Gehrig's.

They then nominate someone else to get involved and share the video on social media.

Everyone who takes the challenge makes a donation to the ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) Foundation, which heads the fight against Lou Gehrig's.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord.

The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death. 

When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost.

Early symptoms can include:
