David Cameron today urged Greece to agree a swift deal with Brussels over its debts, warning that delays could worsen the impact on the British economy.

The Prime Minister, who is in Brussels for talks with other EU leaders, called for 'not a stand-off but a solution' to the eurozone row.

The summit is the first chance for him to meet new Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras for the first time, warning him that EU meetings 'can go on all night'.

The gathering of European leaders in Brussels is set to be dominated by economic concerns following the victory of the Greek radical anti-austerity party in elections last month.

On Monday Mr Cameron convened a meeting in Downing Street with the Bank of England, the Treasury and the Foreign Office to prepare contingency plans in case Greece crashes out of the single currency.

Mr Tsipras used his inaugural speech in parliament to insist his demand for restructuring the country's debt is 'irrevocable.'

Speaking as he arrived in Brussels for a one-day European Council summit, the Prime Minister said he was looking forward to his first meeting with Mr Tsipras.

'I will be saying that what is required between Greece and the eurozone is not a stand-off but a solution.

'The British economy is growing and succeeding but we are affected by the situation on the European continent and the longer this stand-off goes on the worse potentially that could be for Britain.

'That only underlines the importance of sticking to our long-term economic plan,' Mr Cameron added.

Welcoming Mr Tsipras to his first European Council meeting, Mr Cameron warned him the meetings 'can go on all night and in to the next day'.

Mr Tsipras arrived in Brussels this morning after his finance minister was involved in lengthy talks which ended in stalemate with European counterparts last night. 

Most of Greece's national debt is held by eurozone institutions and not by Britain, which could limit the impact if it defaults.

But Downing Street has warned that there remain 'risks of contagion and uncertainty'. 

British officials said Mr Cameron would be in 'listening mode' in his meeting with Mr Tsipras, but was keen to hear the details of how he intended to get his country's economy growing and how he would tackle the crucial issue of Greece's debts.

'The Prime Minister's point will be this is not about us taking sides, it's down to Greece and eurozone partners to agree on the best way to move forward to get the Greek economy growing, to bring their debt down and get it on a sustainable footing,' a British official said.

'They need to work on this together but they need to be acting responsibly and coming up with a plan for growth.

'The point from the UK perspective is that the uncertainty around Greece is clearly a risk to our economy. We want Greece and eurozone partners to get on and sort this out.'

The talks between Mr Tsipras and his European counterparts will be a chance for the Greek leader to set out how he intends to implement the anti-austerity policies his Syriza party was swept to power on.

The discussions will focus on the detail of the reforms necessary in Greece and the timetable for implementing the measures.

Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb warned that failure to reach an agreement would result in 'financial mayhem', but insisted he was confident a deal could be struck.

'There are basically two options here,' Mr Stubb told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'Number one is that Greece continues the programme and we give an extension to that programme. The other option, which I don't like personally, would be a so-called 'dirty exit', where Greece would be on its own trying to claw its way back to the markets.

'I think Greek banks would have great troubles, I think a lot of the deposits would flee the country and it would cause general financial mayhem, especially in Greece, with a slight ripple effect.'

Mr Stubb said that Athens had undertaken to meet certain conditions in return for the loan of one billion euros, and he expected Greece to 'keep its bargain, regardless of the election result'.

He added: 'The euro group of financial ministers are meeting and I think we are all expecting Greece to give a proposal by Monday next week. We will see what they come up with. I am sure a solution will be found at the end of the day.'

European leaders will also consider counter-terrorism measures following the bloody events in Paris last month.
