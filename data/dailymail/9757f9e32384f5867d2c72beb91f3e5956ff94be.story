In a preview clip of Wednesday's episode of The Meredith Vieira Show, the 60-year-old TV veteran revealed why she chose to stay in the physically abusive relationship.

''I was scared if I tried to leave something worse could happen to me,' Vieira said.

Candid: Meredith Vieira revealed why she remained in an abusive relationship in a preview for the Wednesday episode her talk show

Vieira came forward with her account, as she responded to a current Twitter campaign called #WhyIStayed and #WhyILeft, where women who have been abused share their stories online.

The mother-of-three revealed she was in an abusive relationship when she was younger, and she struggled to leave.

'It started out, I loved this guy, it started out we’d have a fight and he’d just sort of grab my arm,' she said. 'I didn’t think a lot about it and then it turned into pushing me into a wall and then it went beyond that to actually taking his hand and grabbing my face and saying, "I could ruin your career if I wanted to and no one would want you."

'Now, this is going on, I’m a smart woman, a lot of people say, "Well, who would stay in that situation? Somebody who doesn’t have the wherewithal to get out, the means to get out." I had that. I had a job at the time,' she added.

Vieira's shocking story was previewed Tuesday, as the NFL Players Association filed an appeal over Rice's supension, asking for an independent party be brought in to access the Baltimore Ravens' player's punishment.

''We
 have asked that a neutral and jointly selected arbitrator hear this 
case as the Commissioner and his staff will be essential witnesses in 
the proceeding and thus cannot serve as impartial arbitrators,' the union said in their appeal.

Finding the courage: Vieira finally ended the relationship when she moved to another state for a job

She said after much reflection, she realised she remained in the relationship out of fear.

'I was scared of him. I was scared if I tried to leave something worse could happen to me,' she said.

She also blamed herself for the abuse, a common response from victims of domestic violence.

'Part of it was guilt because every time we would have a fight he would then start crying and say, "I promise I won’t do it again" and I would feel like maybe I contributed somehow to this and they are saying this about Ray Rice’s wife, that it takes two to tango.

'Then there was the night, we shared an apartment, and he threw me into a shower, naked with scalding water and then he threw me outside into the hallway, we lived in an apartment building and I hid in the stairwell for two hours until he came again crying, "I promise I won’t do this again,"' he said.'

Opening up: Thousands of women have revealed why they remained in an abusive relationship

She finally found the courage to end the relationship when she moved to another state for a job.

'So, when people talk about domestic violence it is really really a complicated issue. It’s not so easy to just get away. You think it would be but it’s not. Having said that, if my daughter Lily who is now 21 was in an abusive relationship, even if she thought she loved this man I would say go. Just go.

'We didn’t have shelters when this was happening to me, there was no hotline. I would say call the hotline.'

Rice hit his then-fiancée Janay Palmer while they were riding an elevator in Atlantic City earlier this year. They were married just one month later.

Happy ending: Vieira has been married to Richard M. Cohen for 28 years, pictured in NYC in 2012 

Vieira added: 'If you are going through this get yourself to a shelter, by all means tell somebody what’s going on, let somebody know.

'That’s 
just my experience with it and I know it’s rampant in this country and 
we all have to accept the fact that it’s not just an issue with the NFL,
 it’s an issue with all of our lives and until we take it seriously more
 and more women are going to get abused.'
