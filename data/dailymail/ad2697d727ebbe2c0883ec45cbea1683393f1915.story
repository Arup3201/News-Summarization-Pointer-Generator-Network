The White House is conducting a review of the programs that allow local police departments to purchase military gear from the Pentagon, urged by President Barack Obama's call for a greater separation between the nation's armed forces and civilian law enforcement.

The examination comes in the aftermath of the police response to unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police killing of unarmed black man Michael Brown.

Two senior administration officials said Saturday that the review will examine whether the programs are appropriate; the amount of training provided for using military equipment; and how well the government audits the use of the money and equipment by local police departments.

The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the review by name.

The review will be led by White House staff including the Domestic Policy Council, the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, and agencies such as the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice and Treasury.

The officials say the review will be coordinated with Congress, where several lawmakers have called for a re-examination of the military-to-police programs.

On Monday, Obama acknowledged that the images of well-armed police confronting protesters with combat weapons in Ferguson made it useful to review how local law enforcement agencies have used federal grants that permit them to obtain heavier armaments.

'There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred,' Obama told reporters at the White House.

'That would be contrary to our traditions.'

The August 9 incident in which 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by the officer and the local police later using automatic rifles and tank-like vehicles to control crowds was not the first time the issue about local police using military equipment has been raised.

An Associated Press investigation last year found that a large share of the $4.2 billion in surplus military gear distributed through the 24-year-old program went to police and sheriffâ€™s departments in rural areas with few officers and little crime.
