Outspoken: Michael Buerk has hit out at presenters who say they are victims of ageism, claiming many only got their jobs because of their looks

BBC veteran Michael Buerk says TV presenters who got their jobs through their beauty have no right to complain if they're axed when their looks fade.

While the anchorman has expressed his satisfaction that broadcasters are now featuring more and more experienced talent, such as Great British Bake-Off presenter Mary Berry, he says many of those that complain about ageism should not have been given their roles in the first place.

He said: '"Presenter" in any case is a very recent job description dreamt up to provide somebody who fronts a programme without any special reason for being on it.

'And if you got the job in the first place mainly because you look nice, I can't see why you should keep it when you don't.'

A number of stars have accused the BBC of ageism over the years. Anna Ford, 70, has accused the corporation of discriminating against anyone over 60.

Meanwhile, former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly won an age discrimination case against the BBC in 2011 after she was dropped from the rural affairs show.

Buerk's comments come as ITV executive Peter Fincham admitted that it is the older age group who drive viewing figures and they need to be given programmes they have an appetite for.

The BBC’s hit drama Last Tango in Halifax, a love story between elderly Celia and Alan, played by Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi, and the box office smash hit film The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which tells the tale of pensioners looking for a warm place in India to retire, are recent examples of the value of courting older viewers.

In his interview with the Radio Times, Mr Buerk he also turned his ire on BBC3, describing most of the channel's output as 'the embarrassing end of drivel'.

The BBC announced earlier this year that the digital channel is moving online to save £50million a year.

It will be replaced with a BBC1 +1 service and an extra hour of children's programmes - and some of its existing shows will be shown on BBC1 and BBC2 with the majority available on the iPlayer.

Buerk, whose BBC career includes stints on The One Show, The Moral Maze and BBC Breakfast, described Snog, Marry, Avoid? - which has run on the digital channel for six series - as 'cutting-edge tripe'.

He told the Radio Times: 'The BBC had BBC3, a channel much maligned in its lifetime, mourned unconvincingly in its passing, rather like Tony Benn.'

He added: 'It did launch a few good comedies, but a lot of what I saw was at the embarrassing end of drivel.

'Britain's bravest youth media brand', as the BBC put it, will be relegated to the internet.

'We're told that's where youngsters forage for their entertainment these days, but everybody's still acting as though BBC3 has had a bullet in the back of the head.'

Among the shows launched on BBC3 are Gavin and Stacey, Little Britain and the award-winning documentary Our War.

Almost a quarter of a million people have signed an online petition asking the BBC to reconsider its plans.
