Raymond Knott, 62, got into a row with his son and daughter-in-law after turning up on their doorstep - but claimed his guide dog took him there (file photo)

A blind man who harassed his family in a furious doorstep row over  inheritance blamed his guide dog for the argument, claiming the animal took him there by accident.

Raymond Knott, 62, denied intending to go to his son and daughter-in-law's house in order to harass them over £102,000 of inheritance.

He said he was completely surprised when he discovered where he was but 'took the opportunity' to knock on the door of the home in Somerset.

The grandfather, who was wearing a T-shirt with 'Would you or would you not steal £102,000?' written on the front, then verbally abused daughter-in-law Rachael Knott.

South Somerset Magistrates' Court heard that he accused her of swindling him out of the money, before demanding it back.

When she asked him to leave he told her to 'scream away' before holding down the doorbell for around a minute.

Courtney Daley, prosecuting, said: 'When she [Rachael] opened the door she found Knott standing there and they had a verbal argument where he said he wanted his money back.

'She asked him to leave but he stepped forward and said he was going to start on her parents and put them all over the papers.

'When she said she would scream if he did not leave he said "scream away, I don't care" and when she closed the door he put his finger on the bell continuously for about a minute.' 

Knott, of Castle Cary, Somerset pleaded guilty to pursuing a course of conduct amounting to the harassment of Rachael Knott.

He was handed a restraining order prohibiting him from contacting his son and daughter-in-law directly or indirectly and from going to their address.

The court heard Knott's father had died earlier this year, and left him £102,000 in his will.

Concerned that he would lose his benefits if he took the money, Knott, who is registered blind, handed it to his grandchildren, the court was told.

But in April he was reported to police by his son after he began harassing him, and his wife, in an attempt to gain access to the money.

'He later tried to renege on that agreement, but this was not possible and his son and daughter-in-law then started to receive abusive phone calls from Knott and he also started turning up at their house swearing and claiming they had stolen his money from him,' Miss Daley added.

The trio attended a Restorative Justice meeting and a voluntary agreement was drawn up where Knott agreed to stop contacting them and not go to their address.

But on July 1 Knott turned up at their home, and after discovering the house was empty, returned the next day.

The court heard Knott claimed he had not intended to cause the victim harassment as he did not know he was at the address at the time - and said it was his guide dog's fault.

Miss Daley said: 'He claims he told his dog to go to certain places but sometimes he just followed him.

'When asked about knocking on the door he said the dog took him there and he had not gone there intentionally.'

Ryan Seneviratne, defending, said his client was registered blind and used a guide dog to assist him while he was out and about.

'He said that he left his house and unintentionally went to the address saying the dog took him there,' he said.

'However once he realised he was there that was the opportunity he had to walk away but instead he asked for his money back.

'He put the money into trust for his grandchildren with the sole reason that he could still claim his disability benefits but then decided he wanted it back to buy a property with.

'This was not seen as intentional harassment, however he should have known better as he signed up to the Restorative Justice agreement.'

Alongside the restraining order magistrates gave Knott a 12-month conditional discharge ordered to pay £50 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Guide dogs generally rely on their owners to tell them where to go, and are simply there to stop the person from walking into objects or in front of cars, as they will automatically sit down at curbs.

However, it has been known for guide dogs to learn particularly common routes, and dogs sometimes lead their owners to the wrong destination out of force of habit.
