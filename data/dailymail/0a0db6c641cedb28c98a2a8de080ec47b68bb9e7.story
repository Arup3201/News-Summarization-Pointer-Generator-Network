Mrs Mockbee had spent 16 years working in the HR department for ThermoFisher Scientific, a biotechnology company.

The Boone County Sheriff’s Office is investigating but had released little information about Mrs Mockbee's death. Police have given no information on a motive or cause of death. No arrests have been made.

According to Fox 19, she often left in the morning before her husband Dan Mockbee who worked at the same place.

The family home was searched with dogs by crime scene investigators last week.

A statement was released by Beechwood Elementary School where Mrs Mockbee's daughters were in the first and fourth grades.

The school said the married mother had been a member of the PTSA and that their 'thoughts and prayers' were with the family.

One neighbor Ken Tarvin told the Kentucky Post last week: 'Dan and Michelle took excellent care of their daughters. That was their whole center of life.

'Michelle was bubbly and friendly and she was the Girl Scout cookie mom in the area.'
