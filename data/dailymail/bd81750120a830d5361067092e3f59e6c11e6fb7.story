Mothers who stay at home to look after their children have criticised plans to allow working families earning up to £300,000 to enjoy tax-free childcare.

The scheme, which would be available to up to 2.5million families where both parents work, would let them claim back 20 per cent of childcare costs. 

But the 1.2million parents who stay home will not get a penny.

Ministers claim that restricting the scheme to those in a lower tax band would exclude middle-earner families and would raise administrative costs.

Stay at home: 1.2million parents will miss out on help with childcare costs. Campaigners said the proposals ignored the cost and work required to stay at home and raise children

But Laura Perrins, of the campaign group Mothers at Home Matter, said this argument ignored the ‘cost and dedication involved in raising children’.

Mrs Perrins, a barrister who gave up work to look after her two children, attacked the Government’s focus on helping families where both parents work.

Such families have been offered up to £1,200 per child under five, but Mrs Perrins said this discriminates against traditional families who have only one income.

She was backed by Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who said yesterday that the Government’s policy was ‘nonsensical’.

He accused ministers of behaving as if ‘the real economic enemy isn’t the failure to cut red tape and empower small- and medium-sized businesses, but seems to be the concept of the traditional family where one parent ... goes out to work while the other brings up the children.’

George Osborne said last week that he had ‘huge respect’ for parents who stayed at home, but was accused of being ‘patronising’ when he said they had made a ‘lifestyle choice’.

Mrs Perrins said the figure of £300,000 per family, which is under consultation, is a ‘grossly unfair measure in austerity Britain’.

‘George Osborne defended the limit on administrative and cost grounds, saying that to set it at the lower tax band would exclude middle-earner families,’ she said.

‘The Chancellor was disingenuous in his explanation, as even a limit of £40,000 would result in families earning up to £80,000 benefiting from the scheme. This is well above the cut-off for child benefit, which was set at £60,000.

‘These limits reek of political point scoring. Mr Osborne clearly doesn’t want to exclude his party’s key voters from benefiting from his proposals.’ 

Marie Peacock, chairman of Mothers at Home Matter, said subsidised childcare should go to those on around the average income of £26,500, not ‘ten times that amount’.
