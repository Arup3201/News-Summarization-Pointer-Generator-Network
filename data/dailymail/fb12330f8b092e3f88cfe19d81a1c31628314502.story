Police have begun removing the last anti-war protest tent outside the Houses of Parliament.

The move came after the High Court lifted an injunction leaving Westminster Council free to clear the tent from Parliament Square.

The injunction had been in place 
while veteran peace campaigner Maria Gallastegui challenged the legality
of new bylaws giving the council power to remove tents and sleeping 
equipment from the road and pavement around the square.

Ms Gallastegui, 53, has been conducting an authorised 24-hour vigil on the east pavement of Parliament Square since 2006 and obtained her injunction against the council preventing it from enforcing the bylaws.

She co-operated with police officers as they moved her tent into a removal vehicle, even helping them to lift it.

She said: 'This is not the end. We 
are going to go to the Court of Appeal. If we lose at the Court of 
Appeal we are going to go to Strasbourg.'

However, she added: 'In a way this is a liberation for me. It is a big responsibility for me to have this in Parliament Square.

'Of course it is also a very profound statement, that is why I wanted to make the signs so large. It has had a big impact, bigger than I could ever have imagined.

'My site has been photographed every day.'

Ms Gallastegui has been offered assistance by Westminster Council to find temporary housing.

Westminster Council leader Philippa 
Roe said: 'We have worked hard to find a solution to this problem 
without prohibiting the rights for free speech and protests.

However, for some time what is a public open space has been dominated by tents and encampments which have restricted its use.

'The High Court also took this view after a full and fair hearing. It concluded the protesters did not have the right to inhabit a public square designed for everyone to use.

'Throughout this process we have sought to find a solution by talking to the protesters involved.

'People will always be allowed to protest in Parliament Square - what is not reasonable is setting up permanent camps there.'

The case arose after the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act came into force which authorised the local council and police to remove sleeping facilities, including tents.

They can also remove equipment used for noisy protests. Many have regarded protest tents in the square as an eyesore before the Diamond Jubilee and Olympics.

Lifting the injunction preventing the removal of Ms Gallastegui's tent, High Court judge Sir John Thomas said the new bylaws were not interfering with Ms Gallastegui's democratic right of protest - a right the courts 'jealously guard'.

He said: 'The right to protest is not affected save to a very, very limited extent that the claimant cannot have a tent or other similar facility in Parliament Square.'

Police officers said that once removed, the large box which is the focal point of Ms Gallastegui's site will be kept for 28 days, unless it is claimed, before it can be destroyed.

Ms Gallastegui said that she intends to claim the box and auction it to raise money for an orphanage in Iraq.
