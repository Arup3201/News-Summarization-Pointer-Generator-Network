It is usually cats that have nine lives - but this fortunate dog had that and more after he survived a mudslide that trapped him underground for 18 hours.

Nicknamed el Afortunado - The Lucky One - he lived through mudslides and chaos caused by torrential rains in Guatemala that have killed five people in recent days.

The animal somehow stayed alive despite being stuck in a subterranean tomb and then barked constantly in a bid to attract human attention.

A breath of fresh air: Afortunado appears for the first time after rescuers find him buried under mudslides in Guatemala

He was buried in Joya Grande village, north-western Guatemala, after an avalanche sent the mountainside crashing on to the primitive houses.

Jose Guerdola, one of the team members sent to search for survivors, said: 'We were looking for people and always, always was this faint sound, like a permanent rapping or tapping.

'We assumed it was someone trapped in a cellar who was hitting a pipe. 'We dug and dug, and we sweated and slaved, and as we got closer we realised it was the barking of a dog.

'When we 
broke through to where he was he jumped into our arms and licked our 
faces. Unfortunately there was no-one left alive in the rubble with him 
but we took him to safety.'

The excited pooch jumped in to the arms of his rescuers after being freed and licked their faces

Local vets checked up on Afortunado and, apart from mild shock and dehydration, he is none the worse for his ordeal.

He has been placed in the care of a local animal shelter until a family can be found that will take him in.

Guatemala's rainy season, which runs from May through November, dumps an average of up to 400 millimetres of rain per month, often causing severe flooding and deadly avalanches in the poor Central American nation of roughly 15 million people.
