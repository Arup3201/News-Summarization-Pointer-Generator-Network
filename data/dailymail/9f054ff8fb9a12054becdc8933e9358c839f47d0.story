An Orthodox Jewish rabbi has managed to lose 100lbs after his shock diagnosis of type 2 diabetes led him to finally take charge of his health.

Rabbi Pesach Sommer, a 42-year-old father-of-five based in Passaic, New Jersey, knew when he went for a health check-up in 2007 that he was overweight at 250lbs, but not that he had given himself diabetes as a result of his 'emotional eating.'

'It was my come-to-Jesus moment,' Rabbi Sommer told CNN, adding that his first move was to buy a stationary bike and pedal on it for an hour a day in front of the TV.

Rabbi Sommer had recently lost his father - described as being 'a chronically stressed smoker' also with type 2 diabetes - and around the anniversary of his death, the rabbi knew he had to alter his own path of health.

Type 2 diabetes is often a direct result of obesity - excess fat making it hard for the body to regulate its sugar levels - and can be reversible if early action is taken.

So Rabbi Sommer got hooked on 24, the suspense-ridden TV drama starring Kiefer Sutherland, and watched it while riding his exercise bike. If the cliffhanger was good enough, he kept going.

'Little by little, I started to cut out everything bad for me,' he says of his diet; switching desserts and processed sugar out for fruits and vegetables.

New hobby: He took up running, lost 2.5lbs a week, and completed his first marathon in 2008. The rabbi (pictured) has since run seven more, and says he 'traded an eating addiction for a running addiction'

The key to his success, after many previous failures, he says, is that his desire to lose weight finally surpassed his love of food.

'You have to be honest with yourself,' he advises others. 'If you love eating and that's more important than losing weight, then eat.'

Type 2 diabetes is a condition that affects the way the body metabolizes sugar.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that over 29 million children and adults in the United States have some form of diabetes.

That is about nine per cent of the population, and the vast majority of these people have type 2 diabetes.

Being overweight and under active dramatically increases the likelihood of developing the condition.

Rabbi Sommer claims that one morning in 2007, he told his wife Rochie that he wanted to run a marathon. 

The next day, be it by chance or divine intervention, someone approached him out of the blue to train for a race – something the rabbi took to be a sign. 

'When I started to run, I just had to run for one minute, and I was out of breath,' he admits. 'I wondered, what did I just get myself into?'

Still, he pushed on and lost weight at a rate of 2.5lbs a week, and best of all, found that he loved it; remarking that he had 'traded an eating addiction for a running addiction.'

Rabbi Sommer ran his first marathon in January 2008, and reached his goal weight of 150lbs the same May.

He has completed seven more marathons since then. Aside from the weight he's shed, running has helped him sleep better, given him more energy, and reduced his stress levels.

He now runs 20 to 40 miles a week if he's training for a race and less when he's not, and five of Rabbi Sommer's children have taken part in races with him.

Rabbi Sommer's waist is now the size it was when he was in seventh grade, and his approach to food is simple these days: he plans ahead.

He decides what he's going to eat before he sits down to the table and walks away when he's finished, full or not.

Rabbi Sommer, who has kept the 100lbs off since 2007, says there are no secrets when it comes to weight loss. Exercise more and eat better - 'anyone can do it.'
