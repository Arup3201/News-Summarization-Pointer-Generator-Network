David Cameron has given the green light to a new generation of Trident nuclear submarines, pitching the coalition into civil war over the future of Britain’s deterrent.

The Ministry of Defence will next week reveal the names of defence firms who have won £350million of contracts to design the new super subs.

The decision means the UK is set to replace the four giant Vanguard class boats with a new Bravo class of submarines, rather than downgrade the deterrent as the Lib Dems want.

Making waves: David Cameron has given the go-ahead to a new generation of nuclear submarines to replace the current Vanguard class of boats, which includes HMS Vanguard (above)

The successor submarines are due to come into service in 2028.

And the design of the new submarines will use a new nuclear propulsion system to make the next generation of boats longer lasting and more cost effective.

A senior government source said: ‘This is an important step towards renewing our nation’s nuclear deterrent into the 2060s.

‘The contracts which will be awarded to British companies will also sustain and create 1900 jobs in the UK’s world-class submarine-building industry.

‘The Royal Navy has been operating continuous at sea deterrent patrols for more than 40 years and the Successor submarines will allow us to do so well into the future with cutting edge equipment.’

Face-off: Mr Cameron's decision pitches him into a civil war with Nick Clegg's (left) Lib Dems, who want to abandon a key Cold War doctrine in order to justify a cut-price nuclear deterrent

Details of the deals were revealed as David Cameron attended the Nato summit in Chicago, where he was set to argue that the alliance needs to get smarter about defence with budgets tight.

But his decision to press ahead with a full blown replacement for Trident puts him on a collision course with his coalition partners.

It emerged last week that the Lib Dems want to abandon a key Cold War doctrine in order to justify a cut price nuclear deterrent.

Former leader Sir Menzies Campbell, a close ally of Nick Clegg, said the UK should scrap the so-called Moscow Doctrine, which has governed nuclear policy for 40 years.

Since the 1970s, it has dictated that the UK must possess the nuclear capability to overwhelm Moscow’s air defences and destroy its government and military command centre.

Changing enemies: The test-firing of a Trident missile. The Lib Dems want the focus on containing the nuclear threat from smaller states like Iran, on the basis that the UK would never fight a nuclear war with Russia or China without the U.S.

Cabinet Office officials are considering whether the UK’s deterrent threat should instead be based on the ability to inflict unacceptable damage on a foe by wiping out smaller cities or military facilities.

They want the doctrine tweaked to focus on containing the nuclear threat from smaller states like Iran, on the basis that the UK would never fight a nuclear war with Russia or China without the United States.

The Lib Dems believe the UK should scrap plans for a new generation of subs and instead adapt the existing, smaller and cheaper Astute class boats to carry nuclear tipped missiles.

Lib Dem Armed Forces Minister Nick Harvey has begun a review of the options inside the Ministry of Defence on the options for a cut price deterrent.

Observers believe could lead to the Lib Dems entering the next election with a pledge to scrap the nuclear deterrent altogether.
