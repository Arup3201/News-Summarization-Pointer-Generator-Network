A scientist has suggested the search for MH370 should be extended thousands of miles north to a Kyrgyzstan valley where a cloud of smoke was seen at about the time the plane could have crashed.

Space scientist and physicist Duncan Steel, who is based in Wellington, New Zealand, admitted that the search for the missing plane in the Indian Ocean appeared to be in the wrong place.

Suggesting that the Boeing 777 jet with 239 passengers and crew on board most likely ended up much further south, he also turned his attention to a valley in the central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan.

In an interview with the South East Asian news agency Bernama today, Mr Steel, who works with Nasa, suggested that some consideration should be given to the 'northern corridor' of the plane's possible flight path until the possibilities could be ruled out.

'For example, someone should go and take a look at the suggested crash site in the Besh-Tash Valley (Kyrgyzstan) which was indicated by a smoke plume just when the aircraft would have been expected to have crashed,' he said.

'In reality, that might be only a one-in-1,000 possibility, but why not go and take a look so as to exclude it?'

British-Australian Mr Steel, who is a visiting Professor of Astrobiology at the University of Buckingham, said his own conclusions matched what has now been established by the authorities - that the sonic pings in the Indian Ocean were not from the MH370 emergency locator beacon.

Based on 
available information from the released raw data, he said, it was most 
likely that the aircraft headed south at near 500 knots and ended up 
much further south than the current search area.

He
 praised British satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat for doing
 a good job of pulling out the data and analysing it, noting that the 
company's analysis of its satellite data was good.

'However,
 that does not mean I am sure they are correct because we have not been 
given vital information about the composition of the BFOs (Burst 
Frequency Offsets) and the modelling that Inmarsat performed.

'If we had that information, we could check on what was done to verify it or possibly find errors,' he said.

Mr
 Steel told MailOnline: ‘I have great misgivings about the present and 
recent search regions in the Indian Ocean. Whilst it seems very likely 
that the aircraft did go south into the Indian Ocean, as in all 
scientific analyses various assumptions need to be made.

‘It may well be that the Inmarsat engineers were correct in their deduction that it went south. But true scientists are always sceptical, and so we keep beavering away until such time as we convince ourselves that what has been stated is true.’

He told MailOnline that Chinese professor Dr Yaoqiu Kuang had looked at the last definite arc of possible locations of the aircraft, and considered possible crash locations in remote places.

The expert then found satellite imagery which showed an apparent smoke plume in the Besh-Tash Valley near Talas in Kyrgyzstan, a remote location at a relatively high, snow-covered altitude.

Dr Kuang then discovered other satellite imagery obtained just a few hours later showed no smoke plume, which would appear to be consistent with a possible aircraft crash.

Meanwhile 
former Malaysian Airlines chief pilot Captain Nik Ahmad Huzlan Nik 
Hussain said he had no reason to disbelief the analysis and calculations
 by Inmarsat and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.

The Ocean Shield departed the previous search area in the Indian Ocean on Friday after it was revealed that the acoustic 'pings' whose data the search was based off were unlikely to have been coming from the plane's black-box. The new search for the aircraft is anticipated to begin in August and take up to one year

A Chinese survey ship has already begun mapping of the new ocean floor, expected to continue for the next three months

He said the calculations had been verified by experts familiar with the fields of satellite communications from a technical angle.

However,
 he added that there are margins of error caused by utilisation of assumptions, which 
may result in the widening of the search area.

In Doha, 
Qatar, the president of the Emirates airline, Tim Clark, told the annual
 meeting of the International Air Transport Association that more 
analysis was needed to find the missing jet.

'We
 need to know more about what actually happened to this aeroplane and do
 a forensic analysis of it. I think we will find it and get to the 
bottom of it.'
