Shock appointment: Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Khan is set to take on an advisory role for the Serbian Government

Sex-crazed former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn is set to become an economic adviser to the Serbian government.

Strauss-Khan - who is due to stand trial in France for pimping and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted - is set to be announced in the role next week, according to an official in the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister's.

'The exact details still have to be worked out, but we will have more information on Tuesday,' the official told CNN.

'Mr Strauss-Kahn will come to Serbia from time to time, but I don't think he will live here.'

Asked why the government had chosen Strauss-Kahn, she said: 'Because he is an expert in the field of economics.'

The government declined to give out any more details ahead of Tuesday's announcement.

Strauss-Kahn, once considered a likely candidate for the French presidency, resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund in 2011 after being charged with sexually assaulting a New York City maid.

All sexual assault charges against him related to the maid were later dismissed at the request of a prosecutor.

More than a year later, in December 2012, Strauss-Kahn reached a settlement with the maid, the terms of which were not release.

But earlier this years judges announced they believed he was ‘King’ of the orgies he attended at glamorous hotels all over the world and that he was the ‘central pivot’ in a well organised vice ring is what has led to him being prosecuted.

He admits attending swingers' parties over many years, but insists he did not know the women were prostitutes.

Strauss-Kahn is known to give advice for free to less economically developed countries and had recently been working with the government of South Sudan.

Under pressure: Strauss Khan faces 10 years in jail if found guilty of pimping, for which he is to stand trial in his native France. Last year he reached settlement with the New York hotel maid he was accused of sexually assaulting
