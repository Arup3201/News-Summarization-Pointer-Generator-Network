Russian observers have joined online conspiracy theorists claiming the Scottish referendum was rigged - saying that the room that the count took place in was too big.

The voting process didn't conform to 'generally accepted international principles of referendums' according to Igor Borisov, who watched the ballots being counted in Edinburgh's Royal Highland Centre.

Mr Borisov, chairman of the Russian Public Institute of Suffrage, was one of four accredited Russian observers who were sent to watch the ballots being counted following last night's historic vote.

Speaking to state news agency RIA Novosti, he claimed that the way the count was conducted varied greatly from 'generally accepted international principles'.

When asked for specific examples of the violations he witnessed, Mr Borisov claimed that the size of the room made it 'impossible' to keep an eye on all the counters.

He said: 'This place is a hangar for aircraft, located next to the airfield. The hangar has dimensions of approximately 100 by 300 meters.

'Even if you wish, it is impossible to see what is going on at these tables.'

He added that the boxes were kept in the room without any protection.

The counting took place in the Royal Highland Centre in Edinburgh, which is normally used as an exhibition centre and showground. 

Borisov said the US state department, the UK and other western countries loudly criticised the Kremlin about Russia's supposed democratic deficiencies.

But in this instance, he said, London and Edinburgh had not 'fully met' the requirements of a proper referendum.

Mr Borisov also claimed that there was little interest as to who was bringing in the voting sheets and said that there were 'no signatures' given as the ballots were given to the counters. Above, votes counted in Edinburgh

Mr Borisov also claimed that there was little interest as to who was bringing in the voting sheets and said that there were 'no signatures' given as the ballots were given to the counters.

He said that this lack of identification between those involved in the counting process would make it impossible to determine at what point 'rigging' occurred - and who committed it.

He explained that the size of the room made it 'impossible' to watch where the votes were being taken.

Mr Borisov's comment as a number of conspiracy theorists have uploaded videos to YouTube, claiming to have footage showing electoral fraud in action.

One video shows a clip of a female counter shuffling piles of votes on the table in front of her. The man behind the footage claims that she is moving Yes votes into the No pile - dramatically reducing the number of ballots.

Another clip shows a man sitting at a desk in the Edinburgh counting room, pen in hand. Two different conspiracy theorists claim that the footage - which was broadcast last night on television - shows him filling in a ballot and committing fraud.

Others have taken to Twitter to voice their concern over suspected fraud.

One user said: 'There's definitely something to these vote allegations.'

Another posted: 'All the Scots were robbed, they need a new vote #IndyRef #English_Fraud'.

A number posted a photo to Twitter of ballots marked 'Yes' on a table above a 'No' sign in the Dundee counting centre.

While Twitter users claimed that this showed the votes were being miscounted, the Yes Dundee Twitter account explained that the votes simply hadn't been counted yet.

The online claims come after police announced last night that they are investigating ten cases of suspected electoral fraud.

Voters turned up at polling stations to find that people had already voted using their names.

Glasgow City Council confirmed that there had been 10 instances where people had gone to vote and found their names had already been crossed off the list.

Spokesman Colin Edgar said: 'We've had a number of suggestions across the course of the day that people have turned up at the polling station to vote and they appear to have voted already.

'This is impersonation, if it turns out to be what it is.'

Last night police officers were present at the count to remove the ballot papers and keep them as evidence.

The papers were from 10 different boxes across Glasgow, and not concentrated in one area.
