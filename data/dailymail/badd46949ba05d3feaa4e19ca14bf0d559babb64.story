Runaway teacher Jeremy Forrest will return to Britain after a French court today agreed to his extradition.

Magistrates in Bordeaux granted the request during a short hearing this morning.

The 30-year-old maths teacher from Ringmer, East Sussex, disappeared with 15-year-old pupil Megan Stammers on September 20 and was arrested in the south-west French city on Friday.

The schoolgirl returned home yesterday and took to Twitter to express her gratitude for messages of support she had received from the public.

Forrest's hearing followed the issue of a European Arrest Warrant after the pair failed to use return Dover-Calais ferry tickets.

Judge Eric Grafmuller said 'everything is regular' with the European 
Arrest Warrant issued for Forrest.

This means that he can technically 
return today, although no exact time has been set, and diplomatic 
formalities could take as long as three days.

Forrest's lawyer, Daniel Lalanne, said after the hearing he did not know when the teacher would return to Britain but that it could be 'at any moment'.

Schoolgirl Megan returned to her home yesterday, four days after she boarded a flight back to the UK.

The
teenager has been reunited with 
her mother Danielle Wilson and stepfather Martin Stammers and was seen 
getting out of a car outside her mother's house in Eastbourne, Sussex, 
yesterday.

She went on to Twitter to express 
her gratitude for the messages of public support she has received in the
wake of her dramatic flight with Forrest - before shutting down both her
Twitter and Facebook accounts.

'Thanks for all 
the nice messages of support, it's meant a lot to me and my family, we 
really appreciate it,' one of Megan's tweets read.

She later tweeted: 'Ps. My only Twitter account is THIS one I'm using. I don't have another.'

Tweeting under the handle 
'p4perlanterns', the profile included a link to the teenager's Tumblr 
blogging page on which she previously posted a 'bucket list' of wishes 
she hoped to fulfill before she died - including getting married, living 
somewhere outside the UK, and trending on Twitter.

But Megan soon closed her Twitter account after receiving some abusive messages, although the majority were supportive.

One offending tweet read: 'Reckon you did this as a money making thing and to get celebrity status!'

Teacher
Forrest was arrested on suspicion of child 
abduction last Friday.

Megan's teacher at Bishop Bell C of E School in Eastbourne, he had travelled to France with the 15-year-old on September 20.

The pair checked into a Bordeaux 
hotel for one night before spending six nights staying at another, where
they subsisted almost entirely on a diet of takeaway kebabs.

it emerged that a British expat had told police where Forrest and Megan were staying days before they were finally located.

Builder
Ian Loveridge, 48, said he tipped off British police last Tuesday after
seeing television news coverage about the missing pair and then 
spotting Megan in a Bordeaux street.

Forrest and Megan boarded a ferry from Dover to Calais on September 20 (seen left on CCTV) prompting Megan's mother Danielle Wilson and stepfather Martin Stammers (right) to plead for her to return

He
said: 'I saw a young girl standing at the top of the street and 
recognised it was Megan straight away mainly because she looked so out 
of place.

‘Forrest was standing next to the entrance and she gave him a big hug.

‘They
then disappeared into the hotel. They both looked very comfortable in 
each other’s company and clearly wanted to be with each other.'

But
it was two days later before French police finally stopped by the 
Huguerie Hotel - and the owner failed to recognise a photo of Megan and 
so they left empty-handed.

Owner Gerald Agier said Forrest had arrived alone and checked in using the name 'Dean'.
