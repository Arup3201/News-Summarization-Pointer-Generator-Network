A former ally of Nick Clegg has accused him of being ‘insipid’ and failing to take credit for the Liberal Democrats’ role in the Coalition.

Jeremy Browne said attacking the Tories ahead of the election in a desperate bid to differentiate themselves was simply a retreat to the party’s ‘comfort zone.’

In the most damning blow for his former boss, the senior MP said the party faced heavy losses at the General Election as they lack a ‘distinctive proposition’.

The former home office minister was sacked from his job in 2013 and has since criticised his party for having failed to take credit for the economic recovery, bringing down crime or its education reforms.

‘We are in no man's land’, he said in an interview. ‘We don't have a distinctive proposition. We have sought to distance ourselves from a successful creation [the Coalition] which has required a huge amount of effort and sacrifice by us to make it successful. That is the sad irony of our position.’

Mr Browne, the MP for Taunton Deane, was once seen a rising star of the party and tipped as a future leader, but decided to stand down at the election and leave politics. Despite previous approaches by the Conservatives, he said he had ruled out joining another political party.

But he has turned against his former close ally, Mr Clegg, saying that after a successful first two years in office, the Lib Dems had returned to ‘sounding like a party of protest in government’.

‘Nick Clegg made a decision that he was going to look inwards and talk to his party and reassure it, rather than look outwards and talk to the country and appeal to it’, Mr Browne told the Independent.

The Lib Dems, who are predicted to lose at least half of the 57 seats they won in 2010, have said they would prop up either the Conservatives or Labour after the next election if neither wins a majority, depending on which emerges as the largest party.

Mr Browne predicted that the Conservatives would emerge as the largest party, but said he believed his party would reject a second coalition at which point Mr Clegg would have to resign as leader.

The next leader, he predicted, would emerge as Tim Farron, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman and standard bearer for the left of the party, who he said would lead them in opposition.

But he warned that in 90 per cent of seats in the UK the Lib Dems would be in a position from which it is ‘difficult to recover’, and could come fourth, fifth or even sixth in the ballot.

‘All we offer is a desire to water down their strong views. We offer an insipid moderation. Whichever party is the biggest one, we will stop them implementing a large number of their ideas.’

He said many Lib Dems would relish a period in opposition to try and build up their strength. ‘Being leader of a smaller party would feel unfulfilling and there would be a sense that this era had come to a natural conclusion’, he said.
