Having a bad hair day is something every woman can identify with.

So some of the claims made in a hilarious new video may be closer to the truth than most of us would like to admit.

Hair Dramas by satirical act Sh*t Girls Say, pokes fun at the hilarious the lengths many women will go to to ensure their tresses remain looking good.

'Oh my God! You're lying on my hair!' Several common 'hair dramas' are shown in the video 

Originally a Twitter account with just less than two million followers, Sh*t Girls Say's first episode posted on YouTube has been watched more than 20 million times. And their subsequent three videos helped them become a phenomenon.

The new footage, to advertise haircare brand Aussie, is filmed in their signature style mashing together many short clips.

The video sees Graydon Sheppard, the man behind S*** Girls Say, which he co-founded with Kyle Humphrey, dressed as a woman.

'I can NOT get it wet': Sheppard, in a dark wig, awkwardly totters around a pool keeping his head above water

S*** Girls Say is back after a two year break, and this time they are focusing on hair 

Acing out day-to-day activities, Sheppard runs through the inventory of complaints and trials women go  through with their hair.

From it being too flat or frizzy to not wanting to get it wet when swimming or crushed when you go to hug someone, every possible hair grumble is enacted.

'Oh my God! You're sitting on my hair!' Sheppard squeals at his on-screen boyfriend in one scene. 

'Did I leave my curlers on?' he asks himself walking down the street in another, and in the swimming pool: 'Don't splash me, I can NOT get my hair wet.' 

The advert ends when Sheppard, sitting on a beach (worrying about the wind's effect on his hair), is nearly hit by a ball thrown by a stunning carefree blonde.

'Watch the hair!': A hug can bring a whole host of hairstyle dangerous 

Sheppard battles the issue of the seat belt flattening his locks 

Not restricted by concerns about her hair, she is free to return to playing volleyball, while Sheppard can only watch enviously.

The humour in this advert and the success of Sh*t Girls Say lies in their astute observations of the subtly of women's personalities.

From inflections in their speak to mannerism, Sheppard and Humphrey have managed to create a highly recognizable satirical character.

And while they may have not have created any videos recently, the Sh*t Girls Say's Twitter account has remained active, posting thousands of simple observations about women's behaviour. 

But it was their move to YouTube that really sent Sh*t Girls Say into popular cultural.

Dressing up in drag, the pair filmed themselves imitating a number of cliches and verbal mannerisms often associated with young women.

The videos became an overnight success, with many finding the series funny, because 'it's true.'

The formula of Sh*t Girls Say reflects some of the most quotable films of the last twenty years about teenage girls, such as Clueless, Bring It On, Mean Girls, and Juno, by using a compilation of easily retrievable and stereotypical one-liners in a culture that revolves around quick status updates and small bites of informatio

However the global success of Sh*t Girls say could be attributed to the fact that the one-liners come from 'real' women, rather than characters on-screen.
