A Greek court has ruled that a children's charity is to be awarded custody of a five-year-old girl who was taken from a Roma family that had been looking after her.

Blonde-haired, blue-eyed 'Maria' became the focus of international media attention last year when police in Farsala arrested a couple claiming to be her parents on suspicion of child abduction.

Although it was later proved that Eleftheria Dimopoulou and Christos Sali were looking after Maria with the permission of her Bulgarian birth mother, authorities formally removed all guardianship rights from the couple last October. 

Maria will now be raised until the age of
 18 by the charity Smile of the Child, who have been taking care of 
her since she was taken away from the Roma camp.

Decision: A Greek court has ruled that a children's charity is to be awarded custody of 'Maria' - a five-year-old girl who was last year taken from a Roma family that had been looking after her

Maria was discovered by Greek authorities when police raided a Roma camp on the outskirts of Farsala. They were investigating claims that weapons were being hidden in the camp illegally.

A prosecutor noticed that the pale-skinned little girl bore little resemblance to the couple looking after her - with the case going on to make worldwide headlines as rumours raged that she may have been abducted from a non-Roma family.

Dimopoulou and Sali insisted they were innocent, saying Maria had been given to them as a baby by a Bulgarian Roma couple who were no longer able to look after her.

Greek authorities later tracked Maria's birth mother to a camp near the Bulgarian town of Nikolaevo, where Dimopoulou and Sali's account was corroborated.

Despite this Maria was removed from the family and placed in the temporary care of Smile of the Child.

News of the court's ruling that she will now stay with the charity until the age of 18 emerged today.

According to The Independent's Nathalie Savaricas, Smile of the Child has not yet received official confirmation of the verdict, but staff say they have been informally told that the charity will now responsible for her care until adulthood.

Panagiotis Pardalis, who works for Smile of the Child, told the newspaper: 'We are available to continue to provide 
everything that is necessary to ensure her well-being as in every other 
of the 356 child-cases we are currently handling.'

Maria is joined at the charity by another 20 Roma and Greek-speaking children, and she is said to be able to speak both languages fluently now herself.

'As every normal child, she plays, talks a lot - she is an outgoing personality,' Pardalis said.
