Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has paid former Cuban leader Fidel Castro a belated birthday visit, bringing the revolutionary a tracksuit as a gift.

According to Castro's weekly 'reflections' column, Maduro had promised to pay him a visit to celebrate his 88th birthday on August 13.

Castro revealed that, along with the tracksuit, Maduro also brought him a basket of fruit when he visited his home in Havana on Tuesday.

The pair discussed the Gaza Crisis, with Castro praising Maduro for sending assistance to the Palestinians, according to the Havana Times. 

Castro called the Israeli offensive a 'genocide' and a 'holocaust' for the Palestinian people, adding: 'I congratulated Maduro for his extraordinary solidarity with the heroic people of the Gaza Strip.'

Cuba's former president did not comment on Maduro's official agenda for his Cuban stop, which was not announced in advance. He didn't say whether the Venezuelan met with Cuban President Raul Castro or other officials. 

Cuba and Venezuela have long been close allies, with Castro providing advice and assistance to former Venezuelan  president Hugo Chavez before he died of cancer last year. After Chavez' death Castro wrote that the Cuban people had 'lost our best friend'. 

It is thought that Castro still provides advice to Maduro, who succeeded Chavez.

Castro lead Cuba from 1959 until he stepped down in from the post in 2006, passing the baton to his younger brother Raul.

While he uses his weekly column to offer advice on foreign affairs, and is thought to greatly influence his brother on domestic issues, Castro has largely withdrawn from public life.

The last time he was seen in public was in January this year when he attended the opening of an art studio in the capital, Havana.
