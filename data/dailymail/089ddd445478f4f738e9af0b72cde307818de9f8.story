A dying car crash victim begged a rescuer to leave him and save his two unconscious friends still trapped in a car wreck just moments before it exploded into flames.

Jason Kenealy, 32, had been pulled clear of a Vauxhall Corsa by a passerby after it crashed into another vehicle and burst into flames.

His best friend Carl Yates, 25, was driving and pleaded guilty to causing Mr Kenealy's death by driving carelessly while under the influence of alcohol two times over the legal limit.

Despite suffering fatal injuries, Mr Kenealy told his rescuer Kevin Willis ‘I’m all right mate’ then begged him to go back and help his two unconscious friends who were still in the car.

Mr Willis, a 50-year-old truck driver, went back into the burning car twice to pull out the other two men, laying them down on grass just as the car blew up.

Mr Kenealy, the front seat passenger of the car, was rushed to hospital but died a short time later from multiple injuries. Other passengers in both vehicles also suffered a range of injuries.

Today Mr Yates started his five year and
four month sentence in jail for his 'reckless' driving. He was also banned from 
driving for six years at his hearing at Bolton Crown Court.

Drink driving: Mr Yates, 25, pleaded guilty to drink driving more than twice the legal limit at the time of the crash

The crash occurred in June last year when Mr Yates was driving Mr Kenealy and Shaun Corran, 22, home following a night out in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

None of the men were wearing seatbelts at the time.

Mr Yates drove his red Corsa VX into the path of an oncoming Toyota Corolla Verso People Carrier, carrying a family of five from Nottingham.

The front passenger side of the Corsa, where Mr Kenealy was sitting, took most of the impact and the car careered into a wall and burst into flames. 

Mr Willis, from Wigan, had been driving by after a family day out in Manchester and stopped his vehicle as the scene unfold.

He ripped the front passenger door off the Corsa to pull out Mr Kenealy and had to go in through the boot of the vehicle to rescue his friends.

At the time of the crash Mr Willis said: ‘My wife kept shouting “Kevin, Kevin, the car’s going to blow up”, but I thought I can’t just leave them there. 

‘It was horrendous, but I remembered my first aid course. They said if someone is screaming they are not alright, but you know they are alive and breathing, so I knew I had to help the lads in the Corsa because they weren’t moving.’

Mr Corran, a football coach, suffered brain injuries and Mr Yates needed treatment for a broken ankle. 

A
41-year-old woman who was a passenger in the Toyota, suffered severe 
cuts on her leg, a broken collarbone, and needed part of her bowel 
removed.

Her six-year-old son needed hospital treatment for a bruised lung. 

Her husband, 42, and their older son, 7, and daughter, 10, escaped with minor injuries.

Tests showed Yates had 190 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit is 80 microgrammes. 

Judge Timothy Clayson told Mr Yates: ‘So many people have had their lives very deeply affected by your conduct that evening. 

‘The sentence must be severe but cannot make up for all the terrible consequences suffered by the many victims.’

Sgt Jeff Hollick of Greater Mancherster Police said today: ‘Yates was reckless in several ways on the evening of the collision.

‘He was more than twice over the drink drive limit, and this may have led to him turning across the path of the oncoming vehicle believing he could get through the junction.

‘That he didn’t kill anyone else in the collision is down to two reasons; the actions of the public who dragged Yates, his rear seat passenger, and Jason from the burning Corsa, and the fact that the family in the Toyota were correctly seated and belted.

‘The woman injured was in a critical condition and still needs operations. The effects of this collision remind us that drinking and driving does cause serious and fatal collisions, and that wearing your seat belt and using the correct child seats saves lives.’

In a tribute on behalf of Mr Kenealy’s family, his girlfriend said: ‘Jay was much loved by family and friends with his brilliant sense of humour. 

‘He always brought a smile to people’s faces. He will be so sadly missed by all who really knew him - truly one in a million.’

Mr Yates’s girlfriend Sarah Hughes said: ‘Carl and Jay were like brothers and did everything together, we were like a little family.

‘Carl is lost without Jay as we all are. He was such a massive part of our lives, and seeing Carl miss Jay so much is heartbreaking.’
