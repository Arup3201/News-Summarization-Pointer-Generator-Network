Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert is planning on holding talks with captain Ron Vlaar in a bid to resolve the defender's future.

With one year remaining on the Dutchman's contract, and following his stand-out performances for Holland in the World Cup, Vlaar has been linked with a number of clubs, notably Serie A pair Juventus and Lazio.

After an extended break for the 29-year-old after his World Cup exertions, Vlaar returned to the Villa fold on Saturday, although only as a spectator for the club's 4-1 pre-season friendly defeat at Groningen.

Transfer: Ron Vlaar is set for talks with Paul Lambert, the defender only has a year remaining on his contract

With Vlaar back in training this week as the countdown continues towards the opening Premier League game with Stoke on August 16, Lambert said: 'He told me he is concentrating on that game.

'He's not had much of a break, but he's enthusiastic, positive and raring to go.'

Once Vlaar is back in the swing of things again, Lambert plans on a more in-depth chat.

'It was a good feeling I got from him,' added Lambert, speaking to the Birmingham Mail.

'To be fair, it was a really brief conversation I had before the game as I was preparing the lads for the match.

'Ron's got another year still to go on his contract, it's not as if he's at the end of it.

'Once we get back I'll sit with him, we'll have a bit more time, but he loves it at Villa, that's well known.'
