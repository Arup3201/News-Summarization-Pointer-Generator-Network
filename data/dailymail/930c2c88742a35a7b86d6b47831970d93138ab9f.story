Dr Abraham Borbor, the deputy chief medical doctor at the country's largest hospital in Monrovia, had been among three Liberians - and the first Africans - who received the drug, ZMapp. Officials in the country confirmed today he had lost his battle with Ebola

A Liberian doctor who was among three Africans to receive an experimental Ebola drug has died, it was announced today.

Dr Abraham Borbor, the deputy chief medical doctor at the country's largest hospital in Monrovia, had been among three Liberians - and the first Africans - who received the drug, ZMapp.

He worked at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in the country's capital.

Initial reports suggested all three recipients of the drug had responded well after receiving the drug on August 13.

But Dr Borbor yesterday took a turn for the worse, the country's 
Information Minister Lewis Brown told The Associated Press.

Two Americans, Dr Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol, received the untested drug and survived.

But
 a Spanish missionary infected with Ebola died after receiving the 
treatment - and there has been no update on the two other Liberians who 
took doses of it.

Ebola
 has killed more than 1,400 people across West Africa. There is no 
proven vaccine or cure for the disease that can cause a grisly death 
with bleeding from the eyes, mouth and ears.

The virus can only be 
transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the sick or
 from touching victims' bodies, leaving doctors and other health care 
workers most vulnerable to contracting it.

The first British victim, nurse William Pooley, is now being treated in an isolation unit in London's Royal Free Hospital.

The 29-year-old had selflessly 
volunteered to serve in a makeshift clinic in Sierra Leone where other nurses had died 
from Ebola or were too scared to come into work.

Mr
 Pooley last night arrived back to London after being airlifted in an 
isolation sack for treatment at the north London hospital.

Last night the NHS started a global hunt for remaining supplies of the only treatment thought to combat the virus - ZMapp.

The drug had never been tested on humans, although an early version had been found to work in some ebola-infected monkeys.

It is aimed at boosting the immune system's efforts to fight the disease.

Only five people in the 
world are known to have received the drug and Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the American company behind it, says stocks are exhausted.

It is expected to be months before more can be 
produced by its U.S. maker.

Health experts caution that the drug had never been tested in humans before and it was unclear whether it works.

They also say there is a huge
 gap between the treatment the two Americans got at an Atlanta hospital,
 where five infectious disease experts and 21 nurses provided rigorous 
care, and West Africa, where even such basics as sterile fluids can be 
in short supply.

Earlier today, Japanese officials said they were ready to provide an anti-flu drug as a potential treatment to the deadly disease.

There is no proven vaccine or cure for the Ebola, which causes bleeding from the eyes, mouth and ears.  The virus can only be transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the sick or from touching victims' bodies, leaving doctors and other health care workers most vulnerable to contracting it.

Experimental serum ZMapp was created from a combination of antibodies in January.

Until the drug was given to the American Ebola sufferers, it had only been tested on monkeys.

It is unclear exactly how it works but both Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol recovered from Ebola after receiving the serum.

It is only available in limited supplies as larger scale human testing is needed to prove it safe and effective.

The companies behind the drug, ZMapp and Kentucky BioProcessing are currently working to have the product approved and the production accelerated.

The companies said in a statement: 'It is important to note that the emergency use of an experimental medicine is a highly unusual situation.

'As a consequence global high-level discussions concerning the policy, ethical, and medical implications of this exceptional situation have been initiated.'

Chief
 cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said Japan may respond to emergency 
individual requests for the favipiravir tablet, before any official 
decision by the World Health Organisation.

The
 drug, developed by a subsidiary of Fujifilm Holdings to treat novel and
 re-emerging influenza viruses, was approved by the Japanese health 
ministry in March.

It is available at any time, at the request of WHO, officials said today.

ZMapp,
 an untested drug only ever used on a handful of patients, has shown 
promising results, apparently aiding the recovery of two U.S. 
missionaries who contracted the virus.

A
 source at the Department of Health said: 'We are working with our 
international partners to source remaining doses for the patient.'

The WHO said earlier this month that it is ethical to use untested drugs on ebola patients given the magnitude of the outbreak.

Fujifilm
 spokesman Takao Aoki said ebola and influenza viruses are the same type
 and theoretically similar effects can be expected on Ebola. 

He
 said the drug has also proved effective in lab experiments on mice. 
Fujifilm said it has favipiravir stock for more than 20,000 patients.

The company is also in talks with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on clinical testing of the drug in treating Ebola.

Favipiravir is one of only a few drugs that may work on ebola. Several drugs are 
being developed for ebola treatment.

But they are still in early stages 
and there is no proven treatment or vaccine for the highly fatal 
disease, and Fujifilm's drug is one of only a few new drugs that may 
work on ebola.

Favipiravir
 inhibits viral gene replication within infected cells to prevent 
propagation, while conventional ones are designed to inhibit the release
 of new viral particles to prevent the spread of infection, the company 
said.

Mr
 Pooley is the only Briton to be have ever been infected by ebola 
outside the laboratory. The only other British case was in 1976, when 
scientist Geoffrey Platt pricked himself with a needle contaminated with
 the virus.

Health officials
 last night said Mr Pooley was 'not seriously unwell' – a factor which 
will significantly boost his chance of survival. Most patients die of 
ebola because of dehydration, when their blood vessels break down and 
their major organs fail.

But
 fit, young patients who are given quick treatment have a vastly 
improved chance of survival. If they are hydrated and the bleeding 
controlled, their immune systems can in some cases kick in, and defeat 
the virus.

The WHO has put the number of people infected with the deadly ebola virus at 2,615.

Some 1,427 have died since the disease was identified in Guinea in March, before spreading to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.

Rigorous
 quarantine measures are used to stop the spread of ebola, as well as 
high standards of hygiene for anyone who might come into contact with 
sufferers.

Symptoms of the virus appear as a sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat.

This
 is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver 
function and, in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.

The effects of the disease normally appear between two and 21 days after infection.

It is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through person-to-person transmission.

The
 WHO said the disease can be passed between people by direct contact - 
through broken skin or mucous membranes - with the blood, secretions, 
organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and indirect contact 
with environments contaminated with such fluids.

The
 Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) issued updated travel advice last
 week which urged people to carefully assess their need to travel to 
Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

'General
 medical facilities throughout Sierra Leone are currently under severe 
strain due to the Ebola outbreak, and unable to provide the same 
standard of healthcare as in the UK.

'Dedicated healthcare facilities for Ebola are overwhelmed,' the FCO warned.

The
 Sierra Leone parliament has voted to pass a new law which means anyone 
caught hiding an Ebola patient can receive prison terms of up to two 
years.

Some 910 cases have 
been recorded in the country - and 392 deaths - but the WHO believes the
 magnitude of the outbreak has been underestimated because people are 
hiding infected friends and family in their homes.

The
 WHO reported that corpses are being buried in rural villages without 
notifying health officials and with no investigation of the cause of 
death.

In
 some instances epidemiologists have travelled to villages and counted 
the number of fresh graves as a rough estimate of suspected cases.
