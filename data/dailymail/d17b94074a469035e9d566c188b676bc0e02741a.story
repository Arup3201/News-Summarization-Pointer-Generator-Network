After travelling half way across the globe for two years, Harry McGurk wanted to give his mother the best surprise of a lifetime.

The 25-year-old, from Fulham in south-west London, spent two long years backpacking around Australia and some parts of South-East Asia.

With his mother thinking that her son was going to be away for another two years, the last thing she'd imagine was to see him return without a heads-up.

Capturing the magical moment, the footage shows McGurk standing outside his family home in London as he tells the camera that his mum was not expecting to see him.

Harry McGurk spent two years travelling Australia and recently returned to his London home to surprise mum

'The original plan was to travel for another two years and fly to New Zealand but my passport was soon to expire,' McGurk told Daily Mail Australia.

'I thought I would come home, surprise her and renew my passport before I head off again.'

Handing his camera phone over to his friend so he could continue recording, McGurk unlocks the door and casually walks in and says, 'mum, my key still work'.

Falling to the ground, she starts screaming at the top of her lungs and covers her face as it appears she couldn't believe who she was seeing.

The 25-year-old recorded the magical moment when he walked through the doors unexpectedly

Still screaming and struggling to get the words out of her mouth, she quickly jumps up and runs over to give her son a big long hug while she sheds tears of happiness.

Wiping away her tears of joy, it was a magical moment for the speechless mother and her son to reunite after two long years.

'I felt very happy - it was a great reaction to see from her,' McGurk said. 

As she pulls away to give her son one good look, the first words she said were: 'You c***! You c***!'

'Yeah I don't know why she called me the c word - it was the first thing that came to her mind but I'm glad I got to surprise her,' he told Daily Mail Australia.
