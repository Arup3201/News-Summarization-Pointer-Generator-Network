Opening with a goosebumps-inducing acoustic set from esteemed songstress Ella Eyre, Gyunel Rustamova's show told the dramatic story of a post-apocalyptic survivor.

The Azerbaijan-born designer, who moved to London to study fashion, used her vivid childhood memories as a point of reference for the collection.

Models stomped down the runway with dreadlocked hair and faux bruises as Gyunel took us on a journey though her years growing up in Baku.

British songstress Ella Eyre walked in the Gyunel  show, which told the dramatic story of a post-apocalyptic survivor and was inspired by the designer's childhood

'For this collection, I was inspired by mythical stories of my past from novels rich in adventure and creativity,' she said.

'With this, I have created a strong, unique and inspirational collection that pushed the conventional boundaries, something that I strive to do season on season.'

Shapes are sporty for AW15, with Gyunel taking the Baku skyline as inspiration for her voluminous capes and coats.

Military-inspired dresses and outerwear came with perforated leather sleeves, while the shortest of mini dresses were teamed with thigh high leather boots.

Cosy knits with leather trims and structured tops with layers of neoprene served to add an athletic energy to the collection.

Coats came with perforated leather sleeves, right, and teeny shirt dresses were among the more wearable items from the collection 

Standout pieces - admired from the front row by Millie Mackintosh, Mary Charteris and Donna Air - included quilted bombers, embellished two pieces and wearable shirt dresses.

Gyunel enjoyed a successful career as an artist before venturing into fashion and her passion for painting fed cleverly into her designs.

She successfully mastered wearable fashion with the kind of artistic flair that makes the Gyunel girl stand out from the crowd.
