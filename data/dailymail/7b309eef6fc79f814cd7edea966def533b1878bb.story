With nine months of pregnancy behind them and the prospect of endless sleepless nights ahead, it is little wonder that new mothers don’t feel at their most attractive.

New fathers, however, have no such qualms. In fact they think they are more handsome than before.

The scientists who made the discovery said that having physical proof of virility may give the male ego a boost.

New fathers, such as JLS's Marvin Humes, believe they are more handsome than before - perhaps because physical proof of virility gives the male ego a boost and reinforces masculinity

The US researchers quizzed almost 200 
couples about how attractive they felt on a scale ranging from ‘very ugly’
 to ‘perfectly beautiful’ or ‘ultimately handsome’.

The men and women rated themselves just after their wedding and then again close to their first and second anniversaries.

Forty eight of the 182 couples had a baby during this two-year period. The women who didn’t have a child felt more attractive over time.

However, the others felt less appealing after their baby was born, the Journal of Gender Studies reports.

In contrast, becoming a father appeared to boost a man’s opinion of himself.

University of California researcher 
Alicia Cast said new mothers may still be struggling to cope with the 
physical changes to their body.

Dr Cast, a social psychologist, said: 
‘First-time mothers report surprise at the extent to which their bodies 
have changed and how long it takes to “get their bodies back” which can 
lead to women feeling frumpy.

The researchers found that first-time mothers reported surprise at the extent to which their bodies had changed, which led to them feeling frumpy

‘Women are aware that their bodies are 
scrutinised even in pregnancy and they seem to become more self-critical
 regarding their appearance as a result of the pregnancy.’

Fathers, however, may benefit from feeling they have proved their masculinity.

The researcher said: ‘There are strong connections between virility, fertility and masculinity for men.

‘Men who are diagnosed as infertile report feeling their masculinity threatened.

‘So, for men, having a child may serve to enhance feelings of masculinity, resulting in men feeling more attractive.

‘The fact that the women were negatively
 affected and the men were positively affected by the birth of a child 
is consistent with other research that suggests that men are less likely
 than women to experience the “costs” of having children.

‘Indeed, research suggests that husbands
 place more importance on having children and are more likely to say 
they want children than women.’ 

She added that new fathers shouldn’t feel too smug, as their belief they are more attractive soon fades.

She also said that as her data came from marriages in the 1990s, more research is needed to check the same is true today.
