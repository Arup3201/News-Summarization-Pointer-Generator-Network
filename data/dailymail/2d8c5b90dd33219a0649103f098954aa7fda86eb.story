Tony Abbott has again showed the nation that he has a big mouth, but this time he chose to put it around a large, fresh onion - with the skin still intact.

On a tour of a produce farm in Tasmania on Friday, Abbott shocked unsuspecting onlookers as he impulsively bit into a raw, unpeeled, brown onion.

Footage shows our Prime Minister grimacing slightly as he bites into the strong, bitter vegetable but then nodding in approval as if he were merely chowing down on an apple.

The public took to the Twitter sphere to mock and patronise the Prime Minister 

Some compared him to other MPs, others labelled him 'The Minister for Onions'

Many have taken to Twitter to slam Abbott for yet another bizarre stunt.

Most of the tweets aim to mock and patronise the Prime Minister relating him to George Costanza from Seinfield, an Ogre with layers, a robot and 'the Minister for Onions.'

'Looking forward to Bill Shorten responding to Tony eating a raw onion by daringly chomping into a roast potato,' read one tweet.

The Hashtag oniongate has been trending on social media since Friday when the onion incident took place

Many of the messages on Twitter aimed to patronise the PM, comparing him to an ogre, a robot and a child

'I may have said 'it's a shame they weren't peeled,' said Charlton Farm Produce owner David Addison

'Better than any other onions I've eaten in a long time' Abbott was reported to have said

'In other news, PM Tony Abbott shows approval of local vegetable oil manufacturer by dipping his hands into a deep fryer,' said another.

Abbott was touring Woolworths supplier, Charlton Farm Produce near Devonport in Tasmania on Friday when he picked up the brown onion during a demonstration of the grading of the post-harvested vegetables. 

'Better than any other onions I've eaten in a long time,' The Sydney Morning Herald reported Abbott said after his meal.

Tony Abbott has recently been criticised for a St. Patrick's Day message labelled 'patronising'

According to the Hobart's Mercury, the owner of Charlton Farm Produce, David Addison was surprised at the Prime Minister's impulsive move during a general discussion of brown onions.

'I may have said 'it's a shame they weren't peeled' and he just started eating it,' he said.

'It was just spontaneous and there weren't even any tears.' 

This stunt has come after Abbott was blasted by the public for his St. Patrick's day video that was labelled patronising and controversial.
