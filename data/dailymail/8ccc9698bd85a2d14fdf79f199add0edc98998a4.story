The harrowing moment a brilliant young British Army officer lies dying after being shot by a Taliban fighter will be screened on television tomorrow night.

Lieutenant Mark Evison’s mother gave permission for the deeply upsetting images, recorded on the helmet camera of one of his soldiers, to be shown as part of BBC Three’s Our War series.

Killed in action: Lieutenant Mark Evison, 26, from the 1st Battalion, The Welsh Guards

The 26-year-old, who served with the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, was fatally wounded during a patrol when more than 50 armed Taliban fighters surrounded his men in a 360-degree ambush.

The terrifying drama and chaos of the battle is seen in graphic detail. The film shows the exhausted 7 Platoon soldiers carrying Lt Evison back to their base – a mud-walled fort - as insurgents’ bullets whistle around them.

Realising time was slipping away, Gunner Steven Gadsby, then 24, lifted ‘the boss’ onto his shoulders and dashed across an exposed bridge to the safety of the base. He was later awarded a Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for bravery.

As Lt Evison lays bleeding on the battlefield, he can be heard telling his men: ‘I’m going down… I’m going down.’

Desperately fighting to keep him alive, the guardsmen reply: ‘No you’re not, sir… Stay with us, sir… Stay f****** with us.’

Their anger and increasing frustration can be heard as they struggle to get a signal on their poorly- functioning Bowman radios.

The communications breakdown meant a helicopter to evacuate the severely injured officer was delayed by more than an hour.

Traumatised troops describe how a better radio with a stronger signal could not be used because they did not have vital spare parts to repair the equipment in the fort, Haji Alem, in a Taliban stronghold.

The BBC documentary paints a clear picture of how soldiers live on the front line

Controversial footage that includes Lt Evison's dying moments is due to be shown in BBC 3's 'Our War'

Hauntingly, Lt Evison foretold of the potentially-lethal consequences of kit shortages in a diary entry 18 days before his death.

‘I have a lack of radios, water, food and medical equipment,’ he wrote. ‘Injuries will be sustained which I will not be able to treat, and deaths could occur which could have been stopped. We are walking on a tightrope.’

A bullet had severed an artery in Lt Evison’s right shoulder on May 9, 2009. He was flown to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham but he was brain dead. His life support system was turned off on May 12.

His commanding officer said Lt Evison was ‘one of the finest young officers of his generation’.

His mother, Margaret Evison, 66, from Dulwich, south London, said today why she allowed the extraordinary footage to be shown.

Mother Margaret Evison hopes the footage will raise awareness of equipment issues within the army

She was given it in April 2010 by the military authorities as they prepared for her son’s inquest.

Mrs Evison, a clinical psychologist, said: ‘Programmes like Our War are important even if I find them very upsetting. They show the grittiness, the hands-on aspects of the war, exactly what is going on. There is still very hard fighting in Afghanistan.’

‘I hope the public will get a sense of how humane the soldiers are. Of how decent they are.

‘I hope people will see what the soldiers are up against – out there, fighting.

‘I want any claims the Army might have for proper equipment to be supported. The more awareness the better. Every tiny bit helps.’

Describing the first time she saw the images, she said: ‘The footage somehow seemed more horrible than anything I had imagined. That patrol base just seemed more brutish… alien.

‘His platoon watched it together. They were relieved because they could see that they had done everything right – that their contribution had been almost textbook stuff.’

Mrs Evison will watch the whole programme, called The Lost Platoon, when it is aired on Monday.

Lt Evison was a physically fit young man with a bright future ahead of him

She said: ‘I will see it. I will force myself to see it. No, that is not incredible strength. It is just doing one’s job, what Mark would have wanted.

‘He wouldn’t have wanted me to do nothing else with my life. He would have wanted me to get on with it.

‘So I must deal with these things. And psychologists believe that the best way to deal with trauma is to deal with it – not sweep it under the carpet.

‘I stay in touch with other mother’s who have lost sons. We are all the same when it happens, all just as mad.

‘Your head knows what has happened, but your heart says he is still there, that he has just gone abroad on holiday; that when the doorbell rings, it’s him.’

Mrs Evison, who has set up the Mark Evison Foundation, offering grants to help young people develop through facing challenging activities, has become close to the soldiers of 7 Platoon.

Lt Evison's diary reveals the shocking equipment issues facing the British Army

She said: ‘I have become very fond of them. When they got back from Afghanistan, they rang me up, one by one, to talk about it.

‘There has always been an understanding: Mark’s death rests heavy on them, and it rests heavy on me.

‘There has always been that shared something, the sharing of pain.

‘I have no doubt that the soldiers loved Mark, just as Mark loved the soldiers. That is a huge comfort.’

She is also unhappy with the kit shortages suffered by British troops. Mrs Evison said: ‘At the time of Mark’s death, there was bureaucratic waste, while the soldiers in the field didn’t seem to have the basic kit they needed.’

Asked whether her son’s death was ‘worth it’, Mrs Evison said: ‘I don’t know yet. That will only become clearer over the years, when we can see the fuller picture.

‘It would be lovely for me and all mother who have lost sons to see the benefit. But in war, it can’t always work out that way.’
