Conor McGregor may have to wait until July to get his hands on Jose Aldo but that hasn't stopped the Irishman taking his frustration out on the UFC featherweight champion.

McGregor challenges for the belt at UFC 189 on July 11 in Las Vegas and he wasted little time in goading his Brazilian opponent on a recent trip to Rio de Janeiro.

Visiting an Irish pub, the Dubliner threw darts at a board with a photo of Aldo attached. He then took off his shirt and worse sunglasses before continuing his attack.

McGregor later posed for photographs with fans before talking to the media.

'They love me out here. I own Rio. Where's Jose? He's not even here, rumour has it he's fled the country,' he said.

McGregor has risen to stardom in the UFC after five victories over the last two years. He earned his shot at Aldo by stopping Denis Siver in the second round in January.
