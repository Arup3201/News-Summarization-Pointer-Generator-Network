Stalking along the backstreets and failing miserably to blend into the background, the sight of this emerald-coloured stray has caused uproar in a Black Sea resort town.

Locals in Varna, Bulgaria, assumed the cat was the victim of a cruel prank by vandals and set up a Facebook group called 'Punishment to the the perpetrator of this criminal act'.

But it has now been revealed that the cat has developed a green hue because it usually sleeps on an abandoned heap of synthetic green paint in a garage.
