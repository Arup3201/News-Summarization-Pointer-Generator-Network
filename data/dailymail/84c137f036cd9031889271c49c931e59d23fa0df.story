100 turkeys destined for the Christmas dinner table have been rescued from a barn after 50 tons of hay caught fire.

The birds were rescued from the fire at Home Farm, in Mitcheldean, Gloucestershire, shortly after 4.30am today.

The blaze is believed to have been caused by an electrical fault in the barn.

Fire station commander Dave Pike said the turkeys, which had been sleeping in a section of the barn near hay bales and agricultural machinery, were all safely accounted for.

But he said their brush with death was unlikely to spare them from the dinner table this Christmas.

He said: 'I understand the birds had been readied for Christmas, and I don't think this morning's incident is really going to change that.

'They were corralled to a safe place elsewhere on the farm, and all are doing fine.

'But, as I understand it, they are still due to be slaughtered.'

Firemen, with the help of the farm owner and neighbours safely transferred all of the turkeys by hand to a nearby pen.

Initially two fire appliances from Cinderford community fire station were sent to the scene with a total of 12 firefighters, but a further 4 crews were called as the blaze took hold.

Watch Commander Andy Fitt said: 'We did feel a little sorry for them as they will still all be for the chop.

'They have all been pre-ordered and paid for, so there will be no reprieve, sadly.'

The fire service said the barn contained 50 tons of hay, one tractor and one combine harvester, all severely damaged in the blaze. There were no injuries.

Mr Pike added: 'We get called to farm fires from time to time, and usually we deal with pigs and sheep suffering from the effects of fire.

'It was slightly unusual for us to deal with turkeys, but the crews did a bootiful (sic) job.'

Christmas Day: All of the rescued turkeys have been pre-paid for by customers who want them for their Christmas Day lunch
