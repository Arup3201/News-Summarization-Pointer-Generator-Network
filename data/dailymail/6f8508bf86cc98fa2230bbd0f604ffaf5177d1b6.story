Jose Mourinho  is worried some of his World Cup stars will not be fit for the start of the Premier League season but was handed a boost after Eden Hazard made his pre-season bow.

The Chelsea manager has admitted Oscar, Willian, Ramires and Andre Schurrle - who all returned late from the World Cup after Brazil made the semi-finals and Germany triumphed - will not be fully ready for the club's trip to Burnley on August 18. 

But Hazard made his first appearance in a Chelsea shirt this summer after coming on as a second half substitute in the 3-0 defeat to Werder Bremen on Sunday.

Speaking to Chelsea TV after the defeat, Mourinho said: 'Eden trained two days, Didier trained three days. They need these matches to look for their form.

'It worries me because the boys (returning late from the World Cup) that start tomorrow don't have time to get ready for the start of Premier League. 

'We cannot deny that our first half was poor. The reaction was good in the second half. Eden brought something to the game.'

Despite an improved performance in the second half, Chelsea were disappointing and a header from Ludovic Obraniak and penalties from Assani Lukimya and Felix Kroos saw the Germans cruise to victory in Bremen.  

Hazard impressed in his 33-minute cameo but admitted the afternoon proved difficult.  

He said 'We tried to improve and be ready for the first game. Today was difficult, pre-season is always difficult.

'I'm happy. It's a pleasure to be back on the pitch with the team and I try to give my best my it's my first minutes. I hope my next game will be better.

'It's always difficult to play against a smaller team as they give everything because they are playing against Chelsea.'

The Belgian also revealed he forget about football during his break after the World Cup.

He added: 'I enjoyed one month (off) - it was easy. I didn’t' think about football, but now I'm back. We will try to win (our next match) and give the best to be ready for the first game.'
