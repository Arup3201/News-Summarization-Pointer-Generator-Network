Four sailors about to scatter a friend's ashes from a lovingly restored historic fishing boat were nearly killed when it was smashed to pieces on rocks.

Skipper Ron Bygott, 66, and three crew members on the Courageous II were about to empty the remains of former shipmate John Fox, 45, into the sea off the coast of Cornwall when it was hit by a storm.

The elegant vessel - which Mr Bygott had spent 26 years and hundreds of thousands of pounds restoring - shattered on rocks near Padstow, with pieces left strewn across a nearby beach.

Wreckage: Ron Bygott and three crew members were rescued but the boat was smashed apart by the sea and eventually washed up on a beach

Destroyed: The historic fishing boat was destroyed after it smashed against rocks - while the crew prepared to scatter a friend's ashes at sea. Here parts of the vessel can be seen strewn across the beach

Mayday: The 50ft ship as it was before it was wrecked. Mr Bygott says the wheelhouse had broken in half after it struck rocks and they were forced to issue a Mayday call

The crew had been attempting to anchor the ship in the Camel estuary at the time of the disaster on April 28, but the vessel suffered a gearbox failure.

The four sailors were rescued by the RNLI who say they arrived 'in the nick of time' as the men would have died just minutes later as the ship broke up.

Looters made off with most of the wreckage left on the beach but a couple of treasured items were salvaged - including Mr Fox's urn.

Mr Bygott said Mr Fox's parents had asked for his ashes to be scattered at sea after his death last December from liver complications. The married dad-of-two from Bristol said: '[Mr Fox] joined me when he was 18 years old. We were sailing together for 28 years and he was a true friend.

'We were going to scatter his ashes at the same exact place where I sprinkled my father Frederick's ashes ten years earlier but we got into trouble going into Padstow. A lifeboat turned up in about 15 minutes and it's lucky they did because my boat and the wheelhouse broke in half.

'The wheelhouse was attached to the main mast. If that had gone we would probably have gone with it.
John's urn was sitting on his bunk when the ship went down. I'd also 
kept my father's urn onboard all those years so that went too.'

Mr Bygott said looters 'even took the figurehead - the one part I was most desperate to keep.' Members of the coastguard rescued the two urns from a rock pool.

Mr
Bygott and Mr Fox had spent nearly three decades at sea together on the
50ft vessel - which Mr Bygott had bought to restore and poured his life
savings into.

The
ship, which he used for displays at boat shows - was just a hull when 
Mr Bygott, a steel company boss, bought it for £12,600.

Sad: Wreckage from Courageous II is spread across Greenway Beach in Cornwall. Looters stole most of the wreckage, but several important pieces were salvaged by the crew

Damage: The remains of the ship's wheelhouse were washed up on the beach upside down and covered in debris

Restored: More wreckage scattered on the beach. The ship had been reused and lovingly restored by Mr Bygott before the accident

More than 25 years later the colourful fishing boat - known as a 'pop pop' because of the sound of its engine - had attracted a huge following.

Mr Bygott said it was so badly damaged - and that so much had been stolen - there is no hope of repairing it. He said to rebuild the stainless steel and wooden ship today would cost £1million.

'I'm absolutely distraught about the boat,' he said, 'I poured 26 years of my life into it and spent crazy money over the years.

'It was a dream, my finest achievement. It would cost you at least a million pounds to do all that work from scratch.
It had a huge following and people would come from all parts to see it.
I've even had someone asking me if I'll sign a piece of the wreckage.'

Remains: The Courageous II had become a popular sight for boat lovers off the coast of Cornwall

Memories: There is little left of the elegant ship - seen here in port before it was wrecked

Costly: To rebuild the stainless steel and wooden fishing boat today would cost an estimated £1million

Restored: The ship, pictured in 1940, was just a hull when Mr Bygott bought it for £12,600

Mike England, of Padstow RNLI said: 'This was a very speedy rescue as the four men were in immediate danger with the boat literally breaking up under their feet.

Fortunately thanks to skilful boat handling in very shallow water we were able to get them off the boat and ashore in minutes and they are all well.'

The vessel was carrying 900 litres (198 gallons) of fuel and coastguards worked with the harbour authority to contain a 'small oil slick' coming from the wreck. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) has been informed about the incident.

Recovered: Despite looters making off with much of the wreckage, Mr Fox's urn was salvaged
