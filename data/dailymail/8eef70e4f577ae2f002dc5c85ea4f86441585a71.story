Australians are well-known for getting out on the water but this doesn't usually mean wakeboarding down a flooded road.

This group of friends didn't want to waste an opportunity to get on their boards so took to wakeboarding though murky flood water.

Just a week ago Australia was basking in some of the hottest temperatures ever recorded but days later tropical cyclone Oswald arrived bringing down lashings of rain.

The young boys stripped down to their shorts and tied themselves to the back of a pickup truck and headed down to a road which had been shut due to water.

Aussie snapper Shay Bourne also ignored the road closure signs and headed out in search of some shots of the floods when he caught sight of the group.

He snapped the hilarious antics in Brimsmead just outside of Cairns, Northern Queensland.

Young carpenter Jake Wright, 18 found
himself with some time on his hands so decided to head out and 'have a 
bit of fun' with his four pals.

Shay,
36, said: 'They looked like pretty tough lads and they were having a 
great time so I wanted to get closer and see what they were up to.

'They
fell over a few times but they seemed fine and there was no blood and 
each time they fell down, they just jumped back up and got straight on 
the board again.

'The water was dirty as it had run straight off the sugar cane fields so I really wouldn't play in it myself.

Thrills: Despite the water being dirty as it had run straight off the sugar cane fields they boys still had fun

'I love any opportunity to get out and take pictures. As soon as anything exciting happens round here I'm out there chasing it.

'I was just driving along taking some pictures of the floods and came across the guys messing around.

The extreme weather seen in recent weeks has wreaked havoc across the country's east with flash flooding, strong winds and torrential rain prompting evacuations of dozens of towns. At least four people have been killed.

The Sunshine and Gold coasts have been pummelled by the low pressure system of Oswald in recent days, with six-metre swells reported in some areas.

In Queensland, helicopters rescued more than 1,000 people stranded in 
the city of Bundaberg as the Burnett River burst its banks, flooding 
2,000 homes.

Tens of thousands of residents were displaced by the torrent, which peaked in most areas late on Tuesday.

Tropical Cyclone Oswald, which triggered the flooding, headed out to sea south of Sydney.

Since the waters began to drop gradually, troops have been helping the mammoth recovery effort and clean-up.
