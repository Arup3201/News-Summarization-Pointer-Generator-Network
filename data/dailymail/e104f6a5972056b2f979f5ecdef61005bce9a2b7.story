An Oklahoma hunter recently got the surprise of a lifetime when, instead of the game he was looking for, a kangaroo leaped by.

Andrew Rice was in a cow pasture near the town of Adair, Oklahoma with his eyes and aim to the sky when something else became impossible to miss.

'We're goose hunting right now and there is literally a kangaroo getting ready to jump by us,' the gleeful Rice says from behind the camera.

Huh? An Oklahoma man was hunting for geese when he caught a bizarre kangaroo sighting on video

Moments later, there it is: a kangaroo in an Oklahoma cow pasture.

While Rice is ecstatic enough to let out a 'Wooohoooo,' the cows seem afraid of the two-legged foreigner and one even takes off in a run.

'What the crap is going on,' Rice wonders.

But just as soon as it comes, the kangaroo is gone.

Strange: The kangaroo went bounding through a cow pasture where Andrew Rice was hunting for geese in Adair, Oklahoma

Popular: Rice posted his brief but memorable experience to Facebook and received 4,000 shares overnight

Rice posted the video to Facebook and it was shared nearly 4,000 times overnight.

While odd, the kangaroo's presence in Oklahoma is not without precedent.

Last year, a pet kangaroo named Lucy Sparkles went missing in the town of Shawnee, which is 150 miles from Adair.

A huge Facebook campaign dubbed Bring Lucy Sparkles got some promising leads but never any results.

While some had high hopes that Rice actually spotted Lucy, those hopes have been shot down.

'In case you haven't heard,' reads Facebook page. 'The the kangaroo caught on film in Adair, OK was not Lucy. It belonged to a local man & they were able to capture it just after it got loose.'
