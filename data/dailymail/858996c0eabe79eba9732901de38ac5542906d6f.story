A mother who helped expose one of the worst hospital disasters has been sent grotesque hate messages by an NHS worker.

Julie Bailey set up Cure the NHS to campaign for an investigation into Mid Staffordshire NHS trust which later found up to 1,200 patients had died needlessly.

The café owner has since received a series of threats from an ambulance worker saying he wished she ‘had a life threatening illness’.

Roy ‘Murph’ Guest, who handles 999 calls for West Midlands Ambulance Service, said ‘she’d done enough damage’.

In a string of comments posted on Facebook, he said she was ‘single-handedly to blame’ for Mid Staffordshire’s negative publicity.

He added: ‘Julie Bailey, I hope you suffer a life threatening illness at night where you have to travel further [sic] than you should do because your local hospital is closed (your fault). Serves you right, go back to yer bacon butties girl and leave the staff alone.’

Mr Guest, a father of two, is being investigated by the ambulance service but has not been suspended.

Astonishing rant: The senior West Midlands Ambulance Service worker said on a Facebook group in support of staff at Stafford Hospital that Miss Bailey, 51, should 'shut her face' and 'go back to her bacon butties'

He is thought to work in ambulance control, handling emergency calls, but was previously a paramedic.

Yesterday, Mrs Bailey, 51, said: ‘I’ve phoned the police. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared if anything happens to me. If I need an ambulance urgently and he picks up the phone, can I trust this man? I don’t feel safe. I don’t feel I’d be treated fairly.

‘He’s supposed to be a professional. Negative comments like this, from people who don’t understand what we’ve been through, just aren’t helpful.

'It has been the same for five years now, it's the same as the threats I have always had hoping that I get some kind of disease. These people need to be rooted out, they are just the kind of bully who works for the NHS'

The mother of two added: ‘It has been the same for five years now, it’s the same as the threats I have always had hoping that I get some kind of disease.

‘These people need to be rooted out, they are just the kind of bully who works for the NHS.

‘I have had a great response from lots of NHS staff, overworked staff have written to me to thank us for our hard work.’

Mr Guest, 54, made the threats even though his mother Irene died at the trust in 2008 having suffered from dementia.

His father, Jeff, 82, a member of Cure the NHS, said she was never bathed, not properly fed and was left to lie in soiled sheets.

Mr Guest – whose wife Claire, 54, is a nurse at the trust – has since apologised and removed the comments from Facebook.

Loss: Miss Bailey started her campaign after her mother Bella (pictured), 86, died in 2007 at the hospital

Murph Guest's real name is Roy and today it emerged his own father is a key member of Miss Bailey's campaign group.

Guest's father Jeff, 82, joined Miss Bailey's campaign for greater care for the elderly following the death of his wife Irene, 73, who was treated at Stafford Hospital in 2008.

Irene Guest allegedly received appalling care during her five-week stay at the hospital. An early Alzheimer's sufferer, she had been admitted with a suspected water infection, but her condition deteriorated.

Mr Guest, a former builder, said his wife was never bathed, was left to lie in soiled sheets, given no proper medication and was not fed adequately.

Speaking at the time he claimed: ‘Irene had early Alzheimer's but in my opinion some of the staff did not know how to deal with her. I also noticed they didn't wash their hands between patients.’

Mrs Guest was discharged in February 2008 and transferred to Cannock Chase Hospital in Staffordshire, before going to another care home where she died two weeks later.

Speaking outside his semi-detached home in Stafford, he said: ‘I’m a healthcare professional.

'I’ve apologised for my comments on Facebook and I’ve removed the comments.’

A spokesman for the ambulance service said: ‘We are shocked by the comments that have been made on Facebook which have reportedly been made by a member of Trust staff.

‘An investigation has been launched to establish if indeed it is a member of staff that has posted these comments.’

Last week, an inquiry into the failings at Mid Staffordshire – partly triggered by Mrs Bailey – warned that similar neglect may exist in other hospitals.

The findings prompted David Cameron to order inspections of 14 trusts with high death rates over concerns that patients are suffering needlessly.

Mid Staffordshire trust faces ongoing problems with standards of care and finances and could be shut down.

It is currently under investigation by the watchdog Monitor, which will decide on its fate later this year.

It has already been forced to close its A&E unit overnight because it was unable to recruit enough staff.

Mrs Bailey set up Cure the NHS in an attempt to bring those responsible to justice after witnessing appalling treatment when her mother Bella was admitted to the hospital in 2007.

She wrote to the Healthcare Commission and campaigned with other relatives of patients.
