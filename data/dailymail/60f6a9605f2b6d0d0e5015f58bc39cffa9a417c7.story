After losing two straight home games heading into a tilt as the away team at Wembley against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, Dallas Cowboys players were happy to see quarterback Tony Romo back at practice on Thursday.

Besides Romo himself, perhaps no one was happier than wide receiver Dez Bryant.

The fifth-year pro, who called Romo’s return ‘very exciting’, said: ‘It was like he never left. We had a great day of practice. It was real good. We’re just going to move forward and see what happens on Sunday.’

‘It always helps whenever Tony’s out there. He’s our guy. He’s our leader. Whenever he’s out there it makes everybody feel that much more comfortable. He know how to lead us in the right direction and that’s what he’s gonna do on Sunday.’

Tony Romo could return to the Dallas Cowboys starting line-up 

The NFL’s leading rusher, DeMarco Murray, was glad to see Romo moving ‘like he always does’ in his return to the field.

'It was good to see him back out there,’ said the 26-year-old. ‘I thought he did well today. It’s always good to have your leader out there. We’re excited to have him back.’

Not having Romo throwing passes may have had an impact earlier in the week, but practising outside of the US wasn’t really an issue. Bryant said:

‘I don’t think we’ve missed a beat. I was telling the guys, I don’t know if it’s London or the air, but I’m flying. Everybody else is flying around too. I got a little extra juice.’

Murray, who has 1,133 rushing yards this season, agreed the workouts at Allianz Park have been beneficial. He said:

‘We’ve had two good days of practise. The mood is great. Obviously we haven’t been playing as expected individually or as a collective group. We’ve moved on. We’ve learned from the mistakes we made and the things we did well. We’ll continue to get better during the week and see what happens on Sunday.’

The Cowboys have struggled with Romo banged up during the last two games. The team has only scored 34 points combined and no player has suffered more than Bryant (five catches, 45 yards) in Romo’s absence.

The former first round pick isn’t phased or feeling any added pressure to perform on Sunday with 34-year-old Romo likely operating at less than 100 per cent. Bryant said:

‘I can only control what I can control. Y’all watch the same tape that I watch. When it comes my way, I’m gonna try and make the most of it. No pressure at all man. What is pressure?’

If the team continues to lean on the running game despite Romo’s return, it won’t bother Bryant. He said:

‘Not at all. That’s our identity. We run the ball and we’re going to throw the ball whenever we need to. We’re just gonna continue to work on our mistakes, get the wrinkles out and get back together. We’re fine. Trust me, we are.’

With their focus squarely on prepping for Jacksonville, the Cowboys haven’t really had much time to explore or blow off steam. Bryant, who managed to squeeze in a steak dinner for his 25th birthday on Tuesday, is planning to ‘step out’ on Friday.

‘I want to see what’s out there,’ he said. ‘So far what I’ve seen is great. I’ve been having fun and I’m gonna try my best to come back in the offseason. I’m just looking forward to the rest of this London trip.’

It’s a trip that hasn’t included any celebratory cake, birthday or otherwise, thus far.

‘I can’t eat cake,’ Bryant said. ‘I gotta keep my abs right.’

If the offense performs well and the Cowboy leave Wembley with a win on Sunday, perhaps he’ll reconsider.
