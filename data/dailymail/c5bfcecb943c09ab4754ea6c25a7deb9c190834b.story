A Houston quarterback lost a chunk of his ear during a game on Sunday after an illegal hit so forceful that his helmet went flying off.

Matt Schaub, who was playing for the Houston Texans against the Denver Broncos, was in possession of the ball when linebacker Joe Mays crashed into him.

Schaub was left rolling around the field in agony clutching both sides of his head before being walked off by medical staff with his left ear bloodied.

After Schaub was brought down by Mays, a second roughing-the-passer penalty was given against the Broncos, causing the Texans to make a field goal and take a 24-11 lead.

Schaub skipped one play in the third quarter but then returned to the field to make his final touchdown, drawing praise from his teammates and opponents alike.

Despite his injury, it was still a good game from Schaub, who threw four touchdowns against the Broncos defense leading to a 31-25 victory for his team.

Texans coach Gary Kubiak said: 'We did what we had to do to win, convinced them that we had to make some big plays and they did.'

Following the game in Denver, Schaub said that he and rival Mays shook hands and there was no hard feelings.

'I felt fine,' Schaub said. 'I just lost a
 piece of my ear. I was bleeding and my helmet came off. So, I had to 
come out for a play, but I was fine.'

Schaub, 31, who stands at 6ft 5 inches and weighs 241lbs, was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in 2004 after playing college football in Virginia.
