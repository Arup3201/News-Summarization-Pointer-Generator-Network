During the whole competition, the  social networking site recorded more than three billion interactions about the World Cup.

In total, around 3.6 billion people around the world watched the final, staged at Rio de Janeiro's Maracanã stadium.

And the five other games played at the same Rio stadium were the best-attended throughout the tournament.

It is estimated the World Cup has contributed a total of £9 billion to the Brazilian economy, according to research from the Institute of Economic Research Foundation
 (FIPE) commissioned by the Ministry of Tourism.

Going off with a bang: Despite initial fears, the World Cup was declared an overall success for foreign visitors

Brazil's minister for sport Luis Fernandes said: 'The main legacy was how we learned to combine an organised environment with an atmosphere of celebration. In order to do this, we had to guarantee the quality of necessary services, which came about through a long and thorough process of cooperation.

'This is the key that has allowed us, in the final evaluation, from an operational point of view, to say that the Cup was a complete success.'

Vicente Neto, president of Embratur, added: 'The latest tourism figures verify how much of a success the 2014 FIFA World Cup has been for Brazil.

'The tournament provided a fantastic platform to showcase the country’s diversity and the welcoming nature of our people. We are determined to continue this legacy as we look ahead to Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games.'
