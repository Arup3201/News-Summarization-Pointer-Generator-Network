A service dog who has been with a teenage cerebral palsy sufferer for the last four years is to join her at her graduation, wearing his very own fitted gown and cap.

Desi, a student at Freedom Christian High School, in Hudsonville, Michigan, has credited her graduation to her service dog Walton, who attends school with her each day and helps with a range of tasks.

So she decided it was only right the six-year-old dog joined her on her graduation day next month.

Desi, a student at Freedom Christian High School, in Hudsonville, Michigan, has said she would not be graduating if it was not for her service dog Walton

The teenager told Fox 17 West Michigan:
 'I was like, you know what, I'm graduating really, but Walton has done 
as much work as I have you know, getting me through the day, helping me 
survive in school, so he should graduate too.'

Walton goes to school with Desi, helping her with a range of tasks throughout the day, including taking her wallet to the cashier at the shops.

Desi's mother Laurel told The Huffington Post: 'We thought it would be appropriate for him to wear a cap and gown.'

In June last year, MailOnline reported on the heart-warming moment Manny Rios walked across the stage at his high school graduation, four years after he was left paralysed from the chest down in a cycling accident.

Manny suffered a traumatic brain injury, and doctors said that he might not make it.

Walking was something he would have to learn over again. Nevertheless, Manny made it a goal to walk across the stage and receive his diploma by senior year.

At his graduation on May 29 last year, he over came the odds and walked across the stage with only the assistance of a walker and his therapist. The whole time, the crowd cheered him on to shouts of 'Manny, Manny!' and much clapping.

'He always said he was going to walk across the stage to get his diploma,' his sister Mirna Hennicke, 35, told NBC Southern California. 'I've seen him take steps but I did not think he was actually going to make it all the way across the stage.'

'I cheered him on. I was like "Wow, he did it."'
