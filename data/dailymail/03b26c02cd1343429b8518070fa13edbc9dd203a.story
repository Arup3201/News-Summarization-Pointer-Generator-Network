Alastair Cook will return from injury on Wednesday with one of his senior lieutenants vowing to provide more help to prevent England’s honeymoon period under new management coming to an abrupt halt.

Jimmy Anderson believes England’s experienced players let their captain down badly during the winter and wants them to take more responsibility to ensure that Sunday’s crushing defeat by Sri Lanka in Durham is not repeated on Wednesday at Old Trafford.

Cook came through a full training session on Tuesday and looks sure to return to a team who crashed to their heaviest defeat in a home one-day international.

Eleventh hour: England skipper Alastair Cook is set to make his return from injury on Wednesday

Preparing: Cook came through a full training session on Tuesday ahead of the Third ODI against Sri Lanka

One heavy defeat can be understood in a
 side rebuilding from somewhere near rock bottom but another today would
 set alarm bells ringing. The emphasis in practice was on positive 
cricket ahead of today’s third match.

‘I
 don’t think the senior players did as much as they could over the 
winter to take some of the pressure off Cooky,’ said Anderson at his 
home ground. ‘A captain’s job is difficult and he needs his senior men 
to share the burden.

‘We’ve 
got a World Cup in eight months so any honeymoon period is going to be 
very short and we have to concentrate  on building some momentum. If we 
are going to lift that cup we need to start winning quickly.

‘It
 can’t always be the captain’s job to discipline people, set tactics or 
make the bowling changes. It’s everyone’s job to be thinking about how 
we can improve.

‘When we’ve
 done well in the past is when we’ve had five or six people who can 
stand up in the dressing room and give feedback. That eases the pressure
 on the captain.’

It is a message consistent with England wanting their players to stand up for themselves rather than relying on support staff.

Back in the nets: Cook practising at Old Trafford in order to keep sharp

There
 was even a little glimpse of England’s new attitude after they had a 
team picture taken on the Old Trafford outfield — the players were told 
to carry their own chairs back into the new pavilion. An attempt to 
imitate the All Blacks rugby team, perhaps, who sweep their dressing 
room after matches. The role of coach Peter Moores in the desire for 
self-sufficiency will be fascinating, because the most common complaint 
about his first spell in charge was that he was too ‘full on’ and intent
 on doing things his way too quickly. 

Anderson,
 a big supporter of Moores during his first stint in charge and now, has
 noticed a subtle change in the former Lancashire coach’s methods.

‘He’s
 kind of let everyone get on with their jobs and hasn’t forced too much 
on us at this early stage,’ said England’s most successful bowler. ‘I 
think he’s going to drip feed things in as we go along.

‘He’s
 got strong ideas on where he wants this team to go, as has Cooky, and 
hopefully in the coming months you will see us playing a positive brand 
of cricket. This isn’t just about getting results, it is about playing 
cricket that is good to watch.’

There
 was little positive about England’s performance at Chester-le-Street 
and Sri Lanka will attempt to take a 2-1 lead in this five-match Royal 
London series by concentrating on their traditional strength of spin .

Hopeful: England bowler James Anderson has called on players to take the pressure off Cook

Hard
 as it was to imagine in Manchester on Tuesday, Sri Lanka captain Angelo
 Mathews expects a ‘sub-continental’ type pitch at Old Trafford, similar
 to the one produced here for a one-day international in 2011.

To
 that end Ajantha Mendis and possibly Rangana Herath, who joined the 
touring party on Tuesday, could join Sachithra Senanayake in a spin 
attack aimed at taking advantage of England’s age-old weakness against 
slow bowling. Yet the fact that the forecast says it will be wet here 
today should dash any Sri Lankan hopes of a dust-bowl. Bringing back 
Cook in place of Michael Carberry is likely to be England’s only change.

One
 change that may be made going forward relates to Stuart Broad, with his
 Notts coach and now England selector Mick Newell suggesting that the 
fast bowler will have to give up Twenty20 because of knee problems.

‘Stuart
 is a key man in Test and one-day international cricket so in terms of 
managing his fitness I think we are going to have to look at Twenty20,’ 
said Newell.

It follows 
Broad’s admission earlier this month that he may have to give up the 
Twenty20 captaincy because of his desire to prolong his Test career.

It seems now that, if Newell has his way, he will go one step further and give up short-form cricket altogether.
