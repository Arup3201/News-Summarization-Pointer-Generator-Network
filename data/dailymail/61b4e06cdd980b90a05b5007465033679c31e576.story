Australia captain Michael Clarke will act as a pall bearer at Phillip Hughes' funeral in his home town of Macksville on Wednesday.

The funeral of the former Test batsman, who died last week after being hit on the neck by a bouncer in a Sheffield Shield match, will also be attended by the full Australia men's and women's squads and many more major figures from the world of cricket.

The service at Hughes' old school is expected to last an hour and will begin with the opening music 'Forever Young' and conclude with 'Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me'.

Hughes died three days before his 26th birthday.

His funeral will be broadcast and relayed on big screens in the Macksville High School grounds to up to 4,000 residents of the small coastal town in northern New South Wales.

West Indies and New Zealand greats Brian Lara and Sir Richard Hadlee will be among those attending, as well as a who's who of Australian cricketers of the past two decades and members of the touring Indian team.

Clarke will also deliver a tribute to his friend, while Hughes' former state and international team-mates Tom Cooper and Aaron Finch will be pall bearers too.

On Tuesday, Clarke shared a picture of the duo on the cricket field together and said: 'Tomorrow is going to be a tough day!'

After the service, all current and former cricketers present will be invited to form a guard of honour.

England captain Alastair Cook will not be among them, because he is with his one-day international team in Sri Lanka, but Test batsmen Nick Compton and Sam Robson are expected to be in attendance.

It is understood the England and Wales Cricket Board will be sending a high-profile representative to Hughes' planned state memorial service - on a date yet to be announced.

Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said it was 'out of the question' that the players should be expected to play a test match a day after the funeral of a respected teammate and treasured friend.

Sutherland said CA would understand if, for some players, emotions were still too raw next Tuesday to face the challenge of test cricket and any player who felt unready for that match could withdraw without recrimination.

'Any player that is not comfortable or doesn't feel right, or there is medical advice to suggest they're not quite right, then we will obviously understand that,' he said. 'I'm sure the broader public will understand that as well,' he said.

'Understand that we and the Australian Cricketers' Association will be supporting them and nobody will think ill of anyone who feels uncomfortable about it.'

Veteran fast bowler Ryan Harris became the first player to publicly express misgivings about playing a test match so soon after the tragic death of a team-mate, saying he hadn't yet decided whether he would take part.

Harris said Wednesday's service at Macksville - where the Australian sporting colors of green and gold are adorning stores and public buildings around the town - would be an emotional trial for the Australian players and only after that could they address their thoughts to the test match.

'Let's get through that first. It's going to be pretty bloody hard,' Harris told reporters in Brisbane. 'It might be a bit of closure or it might take longer.

'The thing is no one knows. No one has been in this situation before, losing a teammate and a very good mate and trying to play a cricket game less than a week later.'

Harris said players would 'probably like a little bit longer' to reconcile their emotions before facing a test preparation.

'But that is reality,' he said. 'There's a test series on and there are games to be played, that's what we have to prepare for. But at least we have a date to work towards.'

In the week since Hughes' passing, Clarke has become a lightning rod for the emotions of his team and his nation. Clarke may not have been a universally popular figure in the past and his relationship with CA had been strained by his unorthodox efforts to prove his fitness for the first test after a hamstring injury. But all of those issues and impressions have been swept aside by the manner in which Clarke has comported himself since the death of a teammate he said was 'like a brother to me.'

In articulately and unashamedly expressing his own grief, he made it possible for his team-mates and compatriots to grieve. Clarke will draw from the same well of emotion when he addresses Wednesday's funeral service at the recreation hall of the Macksville High School, close to the banana plantation on which Hughes was raised.
