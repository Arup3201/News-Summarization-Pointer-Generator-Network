Former Premier League footballer Daniel Agger and his family were left ‘heartbroken’ after their pet dog was killed during a trip to a dog salon, his wife has revealed.

Sofie Agger, wife of the ex-Liverpool star, posted a photograph of Charlie the dog on Instagram, saying that he ‘went to the groomer and never came home again’.

Mrs Agger said workers at the salon, which has not been named, put him in ‘some dryer box’ last week and it was unclear whether the machine was faulty or the animal was simply forgotten about.

The footballer’s wife, whom he married in 2010, said of Charlie on December 6: ‘We lost him today and our family are totally heartbroken. He went to the groomer and never came home again.

‘They put him in some dryer box and we still don’t know if they forgot him or the machine had a fault. Are such in shock and still can grasp that our dog had pain like that and then died [sic].

‘Dearly hope anyone who has a machine like that stop using them. Know it’s a long shot but as I said we’re heartbroken. We will miss you Charlie.’

The interior designer, who studied at Liverpool John Moores University, said of the photograph she posted that the dog was pictured ‘at his best’, adding: ‘This is how we wanna remember him.’

The couple - who have two children together, Jamie and Mason – married four years ago in the footballer's hometown of Hvidovre, Denmark, and their reception took place in Copenhagen.

While he was still playing at Liverpool, the couple lived in a three-bedroom house worth £1.5million.

The star, aged 30, joined Liverpool in 2006 from Danish Superliga team Brondby, making 232 appearances  for the Merseyside club, before moving back to Brondby in August this year.

Upon his return to Denmark, he said: 'I would like to thank the Liverpool supporters for the incredible backing they have given me in my time here and the warmth and generosity of spirit displayed to my family.'

The defender - who won the League Cup in 2012 with Liverpool - is also captain of the Danish national team, for whom he has played 66 times and scored 12 goals.
