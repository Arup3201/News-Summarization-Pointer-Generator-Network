Dinamo Zagreb believe they are close to agreeing terms with Arsenal over the sale of midfielder Marcelo Brozovic.

Talks have been ongoing since October with Arsenal jumping back and forth to various targets but Zagreb say they received an offer of £6million on Monday and are inching towards their valuation.

Zagreb are in the process of finalising a permanent £1m transfer for Manchester United striker Angelo Henriquez, who has been on loan this season, and the cash from Arsenal for Brozovic will go towards that deal.

Brozovic is a tall, rangy playmaker-type but Arsenal see potential in him playing a deeper role. He has six caps for Croatia and Arsenal have already had one offer turned down.

They are also discussing terms with Legia Warsaw over teenage midfielder Krystian Bielik ahead of Hamburg's interest. Legia Warsaw have accepted a revised offer from Arsenal and it's now up to the 17-year-old to decide.

On United striker Henriquez, Zagreb boss Zoran Mamic said: 'We have bought him outright for €1m (£775,000). We have already signed a contract with him for the summer. There is no doubt it is ours and deal is resolved.

'Taking Henriquez depends on us, not on Manchester United,' Mamic told HRSport. 'We took him with the right of first refusal, which stands at around €1.5m (£1.1m), and we have already signed a contract with him for the summer. There is no longer any doubt, he is ours and the story is resolved.'

The Chilean forward was signed by United in 2012 from Universidad de Chile, and was loaned to Zagreb. The 20-year-old has already scored 15 times for the Croatian club.

Meanwhile, Olympiacos have made another attempt to take Joel Campbell on loan. The Arsenal striker also has offers from Real Sociedad and Villarreal.

Brentford have had a £500,000 bid rejected for Southend goalkeeper Daniel Bentley.

The 21-year-old has been watched closely by Bristol City, Nottingham Forest, Watford and Leeds but Brentford have tried to sign him to bolster their Championship promotion push.

Southend manager Phil Brown insisted on Tuesday: 'There have been no bids for Daniel and it's not true we've turned down an offer from Brentford for him.'

However, Sportsmail understands the bid was made last week though Brentford are now considering looking elsewhere. Bentley has kept four clean sheets in his last five games.

Brentford, meanwhile, have signed Josh Laurent from Queens Park Rangers on an 18-month development squad contract.
