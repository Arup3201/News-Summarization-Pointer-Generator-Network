MI5 are recruiting new spies with the help of an online game which lets members of the public try their hand at being the next James Bond.

The game puts people to the test as part of the spy agency's recruitment drive to take on new mobile surveillance officers.

Potential applicants' observation, memory skills and attention to detail are measured to give an indication of whether they have what it takes to be MI5's next top spy.

Spy games: MI5 are recruiting new spies with the help of an online game which tests potential applicants' observation skills

The game is part of MI5's recruitment drive for new mobile surveillance officers, but people who are too tall or have visible tattoos need not apply

The three tests, which involve remembering the colours of vehicles passing by and recalling exact details of overhead questions, are part of the security services' advertisment for new mobile surveillance officers.

A map reading quiz is also playable on the MI5 website, with the ability to read an A-Z crucial for the role.

Applicants should be warned they will not be able to afford too many martinis - shaken, stirred or in any form - on the annual salary of £27,539, which rises to £31,138 after the intense 70-day training period.

The job description is very particular, with height restrictions meaning any men taller than 6ft 1ins and women over 5ft 8ins need not apply as they may stand out from the crowd. 

The same goes for anyone with visible with tattoos, and all applicants must have no more than six points on their driving licence.

The advert states: 'You’ll need to be highly observant – and be able to accurately remember the details of everything you’ve seen and heard.

Be the next James Bond: MI5 want recruits to be alert at all times and ready to pounce when duty calls 

'You’ll need to drive regularly and be confident on all sorts of roads (urban, rural and motorway) at all times of the day and night. 

'You should be able to easily navigate yourself between two different points using an ‘A-Z’ or Philip’s Navigator Britain style road map.  

The job does not sound the most glamorous, with most of the time spent sitting in or walking around London, observing the public.

However, MI5 are very clear that new recruits must be alert at all times and be ready to leap into action if duty calls.

'You’ll need to be able to remain completely alert for long spells of inactivity and then be able to step up several gears when it all starts happening,' the job description says.

'Things can happen fast in this role. You’ll need to be able to make sound judgements on the spur of the moment.'

Applicants also need to be adept with IT systems as surveillance and communication technology is an integral part of the role.
