A cat who lived on a diet of roasted meats and jam doughnuts was forced to go on a health kick after ballooning to nearly two stones.

George, from Liverpool, weighed more than 26lbs - around the size of a King Charles spaniel - when his owner was warned he could die.

The 15-year-old's owner had been feeding George roast ham, fresh prawns and entire roast chickens from supermarkets.

Who's a big lad! Chubby George, from Liverpool, weighed as much as a King Charles spaniel and was at risk of developing diabetes after being fed an unhealthy diet of doughnuts and luxurious roasted meats.

He soon grew so big that he could hardly move off the sofa and was at risk of developing diabetes.

Owner Wendy Moulton was warned her cat could die if she carried on giving him such huge meals.

She said: 'The weight was piling on him and when I noticed that his back legs were so thick I had to do something about it.

'He would eat anything that he wanted and he would be very spoilt.

'For instance, I would get him a roast chicken from the supermarket and he would eat that.

'So I took him to the vets and I was told that he almost had diabetes and if I didn't control his diet I would lose him.'

Lazy: George, 15, weighed two stones would spend his heavier days lounging on the sofa. He ate a diet of roast chicken, fresh prawns and doughnuts, which was given to him by his owner Wendy Moulton

George was put on a special diet of dried food and water. He has now lost half of his body fat and weighs around 14lbs.

Rachel Hughes-Wiseman, head veterinary nurse at Vets4Pets in Liverpool, where George was treated, said the cat is now much healthier.

She said: 'He was the size of a King 
Charles spaniel dog - they weigh about 12.5 kilograms - and that wasn't 
good. So something had to be done otherwise Wendy would have lost him.

That's better: George went on to lose more than 12lbs after being put on a special diet by Rachel Hughes-Wiseman, head veterinary nurse at Vets4Pets

George now weighs a more healthy 14lbs after his owner swapped roasted meats and doughnuts for a simpler diet of dried food and water

'This happens a lot because pet owners think that they can just give their pets any food or even some of their own food.

'Now, George is on a specially-formulated prescription diet which makes him feel fuller for longer.

'He's a got nice skin now and a nice coat of hair because of his diet.'
