Jane Fonda has apologised for making a 'huge mistake' that led people to believe she was against soldiers fighting in Vietnam, after being confronted by 50 military veterans at an event in Maryland.

The 77-year-old was at a speaking engagement at the Weinberg Center for the Arts in Fredrick when she was confronted by the army veterans and their supporters.

Fonda became infamous for travelling to North Vietnam in 1972 where she was pictured sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft battery wearing a helmet and posing with a gun.

Jane Fonda has apologised for making a 'huge mistake' that led people to believe she was against soldiers fighting in Vietnam, after being confronted by 50 military veterans at an event in Maryland; Fonda is pictured above during a visit to Vietnam in 1972, where she posed for pictures and made critical statements

Fonda, seen above during an appearance on Italian TV last night, told the Maryland audience: 'It hurts me and it will to my grave that I made a huge, huge mistake that made a lot of people think I was against the soldiers'

The picture, and statements she made criticizing attacks on the dike system along the Red River, were taken to be an insult to American troops and led to Fonda being known as 'Hanoi' Jane. 

The Frederick News-Post reports that many of the protesters at the event served in Vietnam and carried signs that read: 'Forgive? Maybe. Forget? Never.'

Fonda told the audience that she made a 'huge mistake' that led many to think she was against soldiers fighting in Vietnam. 

She said: 'It hurts me and it will to my grave that I made a huge, huge mistake that made a lot of people think I was against the soldiers.'

Fonda said the realization of the offence she cause over her Vietnam comments 'hurts me and it will to my grave'; pictured above U.S. soldiers carry a slain comrade in the la Drang Valley in November 1965

Fonda, pictured above at the Golden Globe Awards on January 11, said her celebrity made her a 'lightening rod' and that she became a 'convenient target'

But referring to the protesters, she said her celebrity status made her a 'lightening rod'.

She said: 'This famous person goes and does something that looks like I'm against the troops, which wasn't true, but it looked that way, and I'm a convenient target. So I understand.'  

Bob Hartman, an Army veteran who served in Vietnam in 1967 and 1968, told the newspaper that he blamed Fonda for breaking off negotiations among the countries and held her responsible for thousands of American lives. 

Fonda spoke about gender politics during her speaking engagement and encouraged the crowd to not raise boys to become  'emotionally illiterate' by emphasizing masculinity.
