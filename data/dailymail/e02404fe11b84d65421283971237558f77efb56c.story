A man faces a $102,000 bar tab after being charged with drinking 52 bottles of whiskey dating back to pre-prohibition times.

The whiskey was part of a stash of 104 bottles of Old Farm Pure Rye Whiskey found hidden behind a basement staircase at a mansion in Scottdale, Pennsylvania.

The manor’s former live-in caretaker John Saunders, 62, was accused of drinking the historic whiskey after his DNA was found on the empty bottles.

Homeowner Patricia Hill had been planning to donate the whiskey to a local museum and had asked Saunders to ensure that it stayed safe, but instead police say he drank half of it.

Saunders has been held for trial on a felony theft charge and a charge of receiving stolen property after Wednesday's hearing.

‘The DNA doesn't lie. I'm just disappointed a family friend of over 40 years has lied,’ Hill told WTAE after testifying against her former employee.

According to Scottdale Police Chief Barry Pritts, Saunders denies drinking the whiskey or removing labels from the bottles.

It is believed the bottles were hidden away during prohibition times and weren¿t discovered until builders stumbled upon them hidden in the walls and stairwell of the century-old Georgian mansion during renovations in the mid-1990s

John Saunder went through 48 bottles of Old Farm Pure Rye Whiskey, valued at $102,400.

The whiskey was made by the West Overton Distiling Co., which distilled rye for more than a century before being closed at the beginning of Prohibition in 1919.

The distillery was the family business of the Overholdts, who's name is still attached to one of the most widely available rye whiskeys in the United States.

Pre-Prohibition one of their most popular brands was Old Farm Pure Rye Whiskey.

Once liquor was legal again, the family sold the Old Overholdt brand to National Distillers.

Instead he told police he moved the cases to clean them several times but never opened any of the bottles.

‘Saunders said that the whiskey probably evaporated and being that old, it was probably no good,’ Pritts wrote.

A search warrant was issued for Saunders' DNA sample. According to Pritts the sample matched the DNA profile obtained from three of the whiskey bottles.

A whiskey appraiser in New York City has estimated the retail value of the missing whiskey at around $102,400.

Attorneys agreed 
on Wednesday that further expert testimony and evidence will have to be 
heard to determine the exact retail value of the whiskey.

The whiskey was distilled by the West Overton Distilling Company in 1912 and delivered to industrialist J.P. Brennan in 1917.

It
is believed the bottles were hidden away during prohibition times and 
weren’t discovered until builders stumbled upon the nine cases hidden in the walls and stairwell of the century-old Georgian mansion during renovations in
the mid-1990s.

'My guess 
is that Mr. Brennan ordered 10 cases... pre-Prohibition,’ said Hill, a 
New Yorker who bought the house to convert it into a bed-and-breakfast.

'I was told by his family that family members used to greet him at the door each day with a shot of whiskey.'

Hill told police Chief Barry Pritts that she had stored the whiskey in the original cases, which contained 12 bottles each.

After Saunders moved out, Hill said she discovered last March that the bottles in four cases were empty.
