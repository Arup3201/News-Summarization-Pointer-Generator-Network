Foreign criminals are taking advantage of weaknesses in police roadside checks to operate in Britain, a senior officer admitted last night.

Organised gangs, particularly from Eastern Europe, are trying to exploit difficulties officers face in trying to prove their identity.

In some cases, police suspect criminals are able to use false documentation to evade capture when they are wanted in their homelands.

Avoiding capture: Foreign criminals are taking advantage of weaknesses in police roadside checks to operate in Britain, a senior officer admitted last night

They revelations were made as 37 forces joined a nationwide crackdown in a bid to flush out wanted criminals from overseas.

Police chiefs have taken the unusual step of taking senior officers from Romania, Lithuania and Poland on the week-long operation.

They have already snared at least two men wanted on European Arrest Warrants, made 54 arrests, seized 62 vehicles and uncovered a major crime gang.

In one case a man claimed to be Lithuanian when he was in fact Polish and wanted for a violent attack in 2005.

Officers also discovered a ‘significant number’ of foreign vehicles with invalid insurance, as well as motorists who have been disqualified from driving overseas.

Chief Superintendent Martin Evans, who is responsible for the move, said the language barrier and foreign paperwork are ‘challenges’ faced by police patrols every day.

Pulled over: There are estimated to be between 15,000 and 30,000 registered foreign vehicles on UK roads

But the Staffordshire officer said that confronting foreign nationals with officers from their home nation is an ‘extremely powerful tool’.

He added: ‘It sends a strong message to our foreign visitors. You can see the change in their demeanour when they realise they are dealing with officers from their country.

‘In the main, these people are not part of any established community, they are simply here to commit crime.

‘We are certainly not tarring everybody with the same brush. We are targeting the criminal and not the nationality.’

At any one time there are estimated to be between 15,000 and 30,000 foreign registered vehicles present on Britain’s roads.

Travelling gangs are suspected of involvement in offences from shoplifting to fraud, metal theft and vehicle crimes.

Some gangs target specific crimes, for example the theft of valuable catalytic converters or cashpoint thefts using skimming devices.

The latest operation involves eight officers from Romania, Lithuania and Poland and specialist equipment which cross-references number plates with central databases.

Police were joined by immigration officials as well as Home Office officials and enforcement officers from the DVLA.

Eight of the 12 most wanted foreign criminals who are believed to be at large in the UK are from Poland, Lithuania and Romania.

They include Robert Grygoruk, 36, from Poland, who is wanted for possession of a handgun, supplying drugs and running a prostitution ring.

There is huge public pressure to close the net on those who exploit European Union rules on freedom of movement to enter and remain in Britain.

In many cases criminals cannot be stopped from entering the country and when deported they are able to return within days.

Success: Police have already snared two men on European Arrest Warrants

Chief Supt Evans, who is head of the central motorway police group, said: We want to reassure the public that we are working with our European colleagues to tackle these gangs.

‘We will use the best intelligence and skills we have to detect, prevent and convict those responsible for crime around the country.

‘While shoplifting may not appear as one of the more serious offences, it has a very damaging effect on businesses.

‘Some individuals we have previously stopped had significant criminal convictions.’

Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, who has national responsibility for roads policing, said many foreign crooks move around to avoid detection.

She said: ‘Their activity has a damaging impact on communities and businesses that are targeted.

‘We want to prevent the public from the misery they cause and build on the intelligence we already have.

‘These criminal gangs must use our roads to carry out their illegal activity, so by targeting them in this way we are aiming to develop a robust system to tackle the issue in the future.’
