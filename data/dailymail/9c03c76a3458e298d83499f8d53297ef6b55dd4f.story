Former Sweden and Leeds United forward Tomas Brolin may once have been voted runner-up in the 50 worst footballers to grace the Premier League, but he seems pretty chilled out about it.

The 45-year-old showed it on Instagram by posting a snap of himself on Monday doing snow angels - in the nude.

The winner of the UEFA Cup with Parma  called it a 'regular Monday' in the caption - all in a day's work for the man whose career faded  after signing for Leeds in 1995 for £4.5million.

Brolin fell out with Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson and struggled with injury, as well as being accused of not pulling his weight and a lack of fitness.

The retired footballer certainly cuts a different figure to the one that starred in the 1994 World Cup for Sweden. Now, Brolin prefers sticking to poker, leaving his football days firmly behind him.
