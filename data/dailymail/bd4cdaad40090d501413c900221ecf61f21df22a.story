An interactive history project has breathed new life into an old treasure-trove of maps by matching them up to modern-day street layouts. 

The initiative, orchestrated by the British Library, unearthed and uploaded a huge trove of maps, which were made available to the public.

Anybody who matches up a number of landmarks on one of the old documents - such as a road, river or church - to points on today's world map can add to the project, which now boasts more than 8,000 entries.

While some of the maps show the pace of change - streets filling out, roads advancing and railways being built. However, many of the cities featured have still keep their distinctive character on a map.

Old and new: The above map shows the City of London and the boroughs of Westminster and Southwark as they were in 1733. The street layouts are in many cases the same - though there is more open space and no evidence of railways

From the archive: The London map, taken from a 1733 survey by Robert Seymour, shows the still-familiar layout of central London's streets. The city was radically reshaped after the Great Fire of London in 1666

Victoriana: Modern-day Coventry is overlain above with a map image from 1898 - where the location of prominent railway lines through the city can still be seen

Difference: The settlement is noticeably less developed in years gone by. The map extract is taken from a 1898 Cassell & Co. book called 'Our own country. Description, historical, pictorial’

Invaders: This maps shows the south coast of England overlain with a map showing the invasion route taken by the Romans around 55BC

Geological: The lie of the land is still substantially the same, as it would have been in 1862 when the map was published and also centuries earlier when Ceasar and his legions landed on British shores

Four score and lots more years ago: This map shows the modern layout of Gettysburg in the state of Pennsylvania, where one of the bloodiest battles of the American Civil war was fought, which has been overlain with a military map showing troop layouts on the day. Some roads can be seen on both, while the large Freeway, marked in orange, would not have featured

Famous fight: The map shows the ground where Abraham Lincoln led to Unionist troops against their Confederate foes in one of the civil war's decisive clashes

Going through changes: This map of central Sheffield, taken from an 1874 edition, is again significantly less built-up than today - and major roads are narrower and less prominent

Relic: The map of the Yorkshire city was taken from the 1874 book ‘The Imperial Gazetteer; a general dictionary of geography, physical, political, statistical and descriptive’ edited by W. G. Blackie

British Library project asked members of the public to match old maps to real-world locations, with 8,000 done so far

Inevitable march of progress from maps - mostly Victorian - can clearly be seen as urban areas grew

But even in rapidly-developing cities such as London, some significant landmarks and layouts are the same
