A bracelet and app that together observe a person's habits and measures their sun exposure could help make sunburn a thing of the past

Even the most avid wearers of sunscreen have been caught out by the sun and have got a nasty sunburn at some point.

But now a bracelet that observes a person’s habits and measures their sun exposure could help make the painful condition a thing of the past.

Connected to a smartphone app, the ‘June’ bracelet will send an alert to a sun worshipper to tell them how to avoid becoming too exposed to skin damaging rays.

The bracelet, which has yet to go on sale, is aimed at women who want to monitor their sun exposure and has a ‘jewel’ made up of UV sensors.

It was launched at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and will be available in the second quarter of this year in the U.S. for a price of $99, although UK availability and price has yet to be announced.

It will connect to a smartphone app so it can tell the wearer of the bracelet when to apply more sunscreen and put on a hat, based on personal information that they have entered, such as their skin type.

‘Discover when and how to protect from UV rays, avoid sun damage and prevent premature skin ageing,’ the company says on its website.

The $99 app gives tailored sun protection advice based on a
person’s habits and skin type, including tips on how to maintain healthy skin.

It notifies the wearer of the bracelet when they need to apply SPF, wear a hat or put on
sunglasses.

The bracelet measures
sun exposure in realtime and observes the habits of the user.

The app, which is produced by Netamo, a firm known for making weather stations, is able to monitor UV sensitivity in realtime as well as tracking sun exposure throughout the day.

It will calculate the maximum safe sun exposure for a day and afterwards, tell users when the sun was at its most intense.

While other sun care monitoring wearable devices are available, the company claims that June is the first of its kind as it doubles as a fashion item and was designed by a jewellery expert.

Made of alloy metal, the jewel sensor comes in three colours - gold, platinum and gunmetal - and can be worn as a brooch as well as attached to a silicone or leather strap that comes with it.

The bracelet (pictured) will be sold in the U.S. this spring. It will connect to a smartphone app so it can tell the wearer when to apply more sunscreen and put on a hat, based on personal information that they have entered, such as their skin type
