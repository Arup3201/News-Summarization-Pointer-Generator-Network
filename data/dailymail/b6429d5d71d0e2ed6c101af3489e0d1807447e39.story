Sydney siege survivor Marcia Mikhael has revealed how crazed gunman Man Haron Monis told her two people would be shot for every hostage who escaped from the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place.

The chilling revelations come from a preview for Channel Seven's Sydney siege special, Inside the Siege: The untold story, which will also show footage filmed by the network from its position directly across from the Lindt cafe, including snipers taking aim from inside the newsroom.

Monis held 18 hostages for almost 17 hours from 9.45am on Monday December 15, until police stormed the cafe at 2.10am the next morning.

Mikhael, 43, was one of the first to agree to an exclusive interview with Seven, which is thought to have paid between $350,000 and $400,000 for her story - after the Nine Network tabled at $300,000 offer which was rejected.

She tells former Sunrise host Melissa Doyle during the special: 'For every person that escapes I will shoot two, that's when I lost hope. 

'And then I asked them if I could call my kids and speak to them because I actually wanted to hear their voices for the last time.'

The Seven Network has focused on at least four of the hostages locked inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe by gunman Man Monis last December and are promoting the program as 'What Really Happened'

The Seven program will reportedly show how police snipers trained their weapons on the gunman for many hours, along with other footage from inside the newsroom across the way from the cafe

Doyle also interviews John O'Brien, 82, who was the first hostage to run free on Monis' clutches, closely followed by barrister Stefan Balafoutis.

He tells how there was little choice to be made.

'He said "I'll kill you all one by one",' Mr O'Brien said.

'I was probably either going to get shot in there or shot trying to get out.'

Mr O'Brien, who reportedly received $100,000 to speak with Seven, also talks of the mental torture the hostages suffered and the confusion as they tried to comprehend what had just happened: 'Then all hell broke out once they locked the front door.'

As authorities grappled with the claims by Monis that he was carrying bombs in his backpack, so too did his captors.

'The threat of carrying bombs sort of stopped all of us from doing anything,' Puspendu Ghosh admitted during his interview.

The IT manager was one of four Westpac workers who were trapped by Monis inside the cafe, only escaping as the stand-off reached its tragic climax on Tuesday morning.

His colleague, Viswakanth Ankireddy, 32, is also heavily featured in the show.

The preview of Seven's special comes as Louisa Hope revealed she turned down the chance to tell her story on national television, despite significant financial offers, because she doesn't want to 'exploit' the incident which saw three people killed.

Ms Hope, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, has also closed down a funding account to help aid her medical bills, refusing to talk about the deadly attack.

The former bank executive was used as a human shield by Man Haron Monis during the ordeal, and was shot in the foot during the dramatic end of the siege when Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson died.

Ms Hope was allegedly picked by Monis as she could not put up a fight, as her MS drains her of energy and the ability to walk.

Originally from Moruya on the far south coast of New South Wales, Ms Hope, 50, and her mother, Robyn, were having coffee at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place on Monday morning.

Robyn, 68, has been noted for her bravery during the siege, refusing to leave her daughter and eventually injured from a shot to the shoulder, reported The Daily Telegraph.

Ms Hope's stand against media interviews comes in the wake of a series of promotional videos in which many of the other siege victims recount their terrifying ordeal.

'She doesn’t want to be seen to be exploiting the situation and is really appropriate in what she does,' Craig Wallace, president of People with Disability Australia, told The Daily Telegraph.

'She already has to walk with a cane, and she is going to need a lot of support to get her back on her feet,' Mr Wallace said.

Under the NSW Victims Rights and Support Act 2013, Ms Hope and her mother are only entitled to $1500 of compensation, and up to $30,000 for medical compensation.

Both Channel Seven and Channel Nine have secured exclusive interviews with several of the survivors, with the cost for the networks believed to be nudging $1 million.

The networks were so desperate to snare the best stories for their head-to-head broadcasts, they were sending out their stars to 'door knock' the 16 survivors to convince them to tell-all.

60 Minutes has yet to announce when the program will go to air but the promotional videos are tagged 'Coming Soon' but there is a school of thought they will screen the show next Sunday week, head-to-head with Seven's Men's final at the Australian Tennis Open.

The network told Daily Mail Australia: 'The siege story will (also) include interviews with two staff members of the Lindt Café who were held hostage during the siege: Fiona Ma and Harriette Denny.'

'At least another six survivors will be interviewed for the story.'

Meanwhile, Channel Nine's 60 Minutes special is believed to feature up to 10 survivors who escaped after being held by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis for almost 17 hours.

Among those believed to have also been signed by Nine are Joel Herat and Jarrod Morton Hoffman, the sum total of all the interviews thought to be nudging $1 million. 

Daily Mail Australia also understands the rival specials may both air on Sunday February 1, which is the week when the television ratings season kicks off, rather than Australia Day as has previously been claimed. This would be after the coronial inquest starts on January 29.

Seven would need to slot its program in before the men's final, if that was the case.
