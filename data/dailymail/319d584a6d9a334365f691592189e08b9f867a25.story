A top chef shot dead by police after robbing a bank wearing drag and cartoonish makeup reportedly had a secret heroin addiction.

Cody Spafford, 26, held up a Wells Fargo branch in Seattle, Washington, last year while wearing a fake nose, a wig, skirt and thick white makeup.

Using a fake gun, he threatened tellers and made off with $90,000 stuffed in a suitcase before crashing his car about a mile away.

Hold-up: Cody Spafford, a 26-year-old sous chef in a prestigious Seattle restaurant, held up a Wells Fargo branch in women's clothes and thick makeup last year

Spafford, who abandoned his realistic-looking BB gun, but kept hold of an 8-inch knife, was shot seven times in a stand-off with police and died at the scene.

His family in Utah, and co-workers at The Walrus and The Carpenter, an upscale oyster bar where he was sous chef, were stunned to learn that the man they knew was behind the April 2014 hold-up.

Spafford was also set to take a job at high profile New York restaurant Buvette. 

But, according to a long profile of Spafford published in the Seattle Metropolitan magazine, the high-adrenaline bank robbery was not the only thing those close to him would never have suspected.

In the wake of the robbery, police investigators found syringes and a pipe inside his crashed Hyundai, which he flipped over in an affluent Seattle street before climbing on to a roof of a nearby garage, where police caught up with him.

An earlier profile in The Stranger, an alternative weekly newspaper in Seattle, said his housemate Monica found evidence of drug use in his room - though she wouldn't expand on what 'drug paraphernalia' was there.

The Metropolitan also reported Spafford had been increasingly erratic in the weeks leading up to the robbery. The profile said he had started coming to work late, forget to place orders for new oysters, and would wear long-sleeved clothes, which would have hidden any signs of drug use.

An inquest also revealed that he had burned through almost $10,000 of savings in the weeks before he died - and was awaiting a prison sentence for a DUI charge from when he visited home in Utah.

Even his parents reportedly had no idea he had relapsed into heroin use, which had plagued his youth.

Spafford had reportedly spiraled into addiction as a high school senior back in Salt Lake City, but kicked the habit before moving to Seattle in 2010 for a new start.

In Utah, the drug use led to seven arrests and months in jail - while he even robbed his own mother and forged checks in her name so he could get high, according to the Metropolitan. 

But after a rehabilitation program, and a promising career change in Seattle's burgeoning oyster bar culture, the addictions of the past was seemingly behind him.

The magazine hinted that 'the occasional joint' of marijuana was part of the lifestyle at The Walrus and The Carpenter - but never a hint of hard drugs.

Co-owner Jeremy Price told the Metropolitan: 'None of us had experience with someone who was addicted to heroin'.

Spafford was due to leave Seattle to take up a head chef's post at a French restaurant in Salt Lake City - but never made the trip after his fatal run-in with police less than a month before his start date.
