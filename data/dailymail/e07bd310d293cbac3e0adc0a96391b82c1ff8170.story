Sergio Gonzales got the shock of his life when a palm tree branch fell from above went through his car windscreen and hit him in the face.

And it turned out the branch was not even from a real tree. A metal replica snapped off a T-Mobile phone mast during high winds in El Paso, Texas.

The branch landed just inches from Mr Gonzales’s neck but he survived the scare with cuts to his face that were treated in hospital.

‘I truly thought somebody had hit me,’ Mr Gonzales told ABC affiliate KVIA. ‘I took out a rag to clean up and realised I had glass all over me.’

Mobile phone towers are often disguised as trees in U.S. cities after consultation with residents who want them to be less of an eyesore.

The tower in question was modified by T-Mobile in 2007 to look like a palm tree and was given a safety check in March 2011, reported KVIA.

New branches were added on in 2010 - but the one that snapped off broke in the middle, rather than at the attachment point to the pole.

Up high: Mr Gonzales only realised the branch had come from the structure when a passer-by pointed at the fake palm tree standing tall above him

City inspectors are probing the incident and El Paso Rep. Susie Byrd said she will work to avoid something like this reoccurring.

‘A cell phone tower should not present a danger to the community,’ the 40-year-old politician told NBC affiliate KTSM.

A T-Mobile spokesman said the firm is also probing Monday’s incident and will carry out an inspection before the tower is put back into service.
