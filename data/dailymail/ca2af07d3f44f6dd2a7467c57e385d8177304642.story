Lethal United States drones are launched from a top secret base in Saudi Arabia, it has emerged.

The CIA uses the base to target Al Qaeda operatives in neighbouring Yemen, according to the New York Times.

It was from this base that the American-born operative Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in 2011.

It has also emerged that up to 54 countries may have helped the CIA to hold terrorism suspects in secret prisons, or turn them over to foreign governments, a human rights organisation has claimed.

The drone that killed American-born operative Anwar al-Awlaki in 2011 was launched from a secret base in Saudi Arabia, it has emerged

The revelation comes amid a growing outcry against the Obama administration's use of deadly drones and their use to watch American citizens.Â 

It is the first time the location of the secret drone base has been revealed.

It's whereabouts had remained secret at the request of high-ranking officials, although it was known that one had been built.

Congress is now trying to limit the power the US has to kill suspected terrorists, including American citizens, with drones.

The drone programme is expected to be the major talking point when the Senate Intelligence Committee interviews John Brennan, the White Houses's choice for CIA chief on Thursday.

Yesterday the government defended its lethal drone programme by citing the laws that were introduced following the September 11 attacks.

Many in Congress now believe the scope of the laws may be too broad.

Democratic Senator Chris Coons said in a recent: 'It has to be in the agenda of this Congress to reconsider the scope of action of drones and use of deadly force by the United States around the world because the original authorisation of use of force, I think, is being strained to its limits,'

Congressman Steny Hoyer, the number two Democrat in the House of Representatives, said yesterday, that 'it deserves a serious look at how we make the decisions in government to take out, kill, eliminate, whatever word you want to use, not just American citizens but other citizens as well.'

Hoyer added: 'We ought to carefully review our policies as a country.'

Democratic Chairman Robert Menendez and
 the panel's top Republican, Senator Bob Corker, both have both quietly 
expressed concerns about the deadly operation and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is likely to hold hearings on US drone policy, an aide said on Tuesday.

The U.S. government can legally order the killing of American citizens if they have senior-level ties to al-Qaida

The memo outlines for the first time the
 Obama administration's decision to kill al-Qaida terror suspects 
without any evidence that specific and imminent plots are being planned 
against the United States.

Earlier this week, a group of 11 Democratic and Republican senators urged President Barack Obama to release a classified Justice Department legal opinion justifying when US counter-terror missions, including drone strikes, can be used to kill American citizens abroad.

Without those documents, it's impossible for Congress and the public to decide 'whether this authority has been properly defined, and whether the president's power to deliberately kill Americans is subject to appropriate limitations and safeguards,' the senators wrote.

'The threat posed by al-Qaida and its associated forces demands a broader concept of imminence in judging when a person continually planning terror attacks presents an imminent threat,' concluded the document.

US citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico, was killed by a drone in Yemen in 2011. It was launched from a secret base in Saudi Arabia

The memo was immediately decried by civil liberties groups as 'flawed' and 'profoundly disturbing' - especially in light of 2011 US drone strikes in Yemen that killed three American citizens: Anwar al-Awlaki, his 16-year-old-son and Samir Khan.

Al-Awlaki was linked to the planning and execution of several attacks targeting US and Western interests, including the attempt to down a Detroit-bound airliner in 2009 and the plot to bomb cargo planes in 2010. His son was killed in a separate strike on a suspected al-Qaida den. Khan was an al-Qaida propagandist.

White House spokesman Jay Carney called the strikes 'legal, ethical and wise' and said they are covered by a law that Congress approved allowing the use of military force against al-Qaida.

He added: 'It is a matter of fact 
that al-Qaida is in a state of war against us and that senior leaders, 
operational leaders of al-Qaida are continually plotting to attack the 
United States, plotting to kill American citizens as they did most 
horrifically on September 11th of 2001.'

Three
 days after September 11, Congress approved a law authorising the 
military to use 'all necessary and appropriate force' against al-Qaida 
and other groups believed to be helping or harbouring the global terror 
network, including the use of drone strikes.

Because militants have since splintered into a number of affiliates and sympathisers the current laws could allow military force against thousands of people across the Middle East and North Africa who have limited or no ability to strike the US.

Both the CIA and the US military are authorised to remotely pilot unmanned, missile-carrying drones against terror suspects.

It's unknown exactly how many strikes have been carried out, but experts say that drone attacks in Pakistan are conducted by the CIA, while those in Yemen and Somalia, for example, are by military forces.

The drones have strained diplomacy between the US and the nations where the strikes are carried out, as civilians have been killed alongside the targeted terrorists, even though most nations have given Washington at least tacit agreement to carry out the attacks.

The use of drones has caused tensions in some countries where civilians have died

A Middle Eastern diplomat said that in Yemen, for example, an increase of US drone strikes last month have killed dozens of people and upset the local public, leading some leaders in Sanaa to reconsider how often they should be used.

The Pentagon is also considering basing 
surveillance drones in Niger to monitor on burgeoning extremist violence
 in North Africa, but it's not clear if they will be armed, it has emerged.

The campaign against the use of drones to spy on US citizens has also been growing in momentum.

On Monday, Charlottesville, in 
Virginia, became the first city in the United States to pass a 
resolution against the use of drones for surveillance against American 
citizens.

It calls on Congress and the General 
Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia to bring in laws 'prohibiting 
information obtained from the domestic use of drones from being 
introduced into a Federal or State court.'

The resolution also 'pledges to abstain from similar uses with city-owned, leased or borrowed drones.'

Dede Smith, a council member who voted in favour of the bill, told US News that drones are 'pretty clearly a threat to our constitutional right to privacy.'

She added: 'If we don't get out ahead 
of it to establish some guidelines for how drones are used, they will be
 used in a very invasive way and we'll be left to try and pick up the 
pieces.'

The campaign has been helped by a 
Justice Department memo that has recently surfaced, which show drones 
can strike against a wider range of threats than previously believed.
