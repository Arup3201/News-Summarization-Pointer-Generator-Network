ISIS is on the lookout for a skilled professional to manage its failing oil refineries and has been using black-market agents to advertise the £140,000-a-year post.

The terror group is said to have captured at least 11 oil fields in Iraq and Syria during its offensive campaign and was thought to be making around £2million-a-day from sales in June.

But a string of fatal accidents and a lack of ideological commitment from trained engineers has seen its profits slump by more than two thirds.

Meet your new bosses: ISIS is looking to recruit a skilled manager to run its faltering illegal oil business

Up to now jihadists have run their newly-acquired business through intimidation - threatening to kill employees' families if they fail to comply.

But their murderous approach to those not loyal to the ISIS cause has seen them hemorrhage trained engineers, The Times reports.

The refineries manager position is the most senior of several vacancies that the terror group is hoping to fill.

Oil workers in Iraq say black market agents have been spreading the word through jihadist networks - casting their net as far afield as north Africa.

Robin Mills, at Manaar Energy, a consultancy firm in Dubai, has confirmed the reports but believes ISIS will struggle to attract the best staff with the pay packet they are offering.

He said: 'The money is good, but it's not that good. A western oil exec posted to Iraq right now, let alone working for ISIS, would expect to earn a lot more than that.'

And officials at Iraq's North Oil Company, which has lost one field to ISIS, said: 'With each round of fighting, more staff drift away. Initially they coerced staff, threatening to kill their families. Now they're offering the carrot instead.' 

It is believed the militant group has also struggled to attract large buyers for its product. 

Matthew M. Reed, a Washington-based consultant who analyzes oil and politics in the Middle East, told CBC News last month: 'No big traders, no serious companies are going to fool around with that oil.

'That oil is essentially radioactive at this point. No one wants to touch it.'

What that means is that the vast majority of the group's oil sales is going to so-called 'middlemen'.

These are people who own their own tanker trucks and who have connections to established smuggling networks in northern Syria and southern Turkey, or to local refineries in places like Syria, Iraq, Kurdistan and Turkey.

Under threat: Iraqi security forces said they advanced to within one mile of the city of Baiji this week in a new offensive to retake the country's biggest oil refinery

Mr Reed adds: 'They're relying on very small transactions and a lot of them in order to move the oil because they're selling it by tanker truck more often than not. 

'And a tanker truck can't hold that much oil.'

The terrorist organisation has gone about plundering oil and gas facilities since its emergence in 2012 and last month was said to have appointed an 'oil minister' to run the illegal industry after its operatives stole 200 lorries in Iraq.

It has captured oil fields at Sasan, Ajeel and Sadid in Iraq as well as Omar in Syria while large refineries have also been captured at Fallujah, Aksas and Tikrit.

Iraq's largest oil refinery in Baiji, located around 130 miles north of Baghdad, has also been under siege since June - and is thought to be ISIS' biggest source of wealth

Using smuggling networks to transport their product across borders - jihadists can make around £15 a barrel 

After many existing engineers fled ISIS has been forced to operate with 'skeleton staff' at some of their facilities including Omar, which has changed hands three times since the conflict started.

It is understood that ISIS was taking about 80,000 barrels a day from oil fields it was controlling in Iraq and Syria - but that has halved in recent months. 

Iraqi security forces said this week they were now within a 1.2 miles of the city of Baiji in a new offensive to retake the refinery.
