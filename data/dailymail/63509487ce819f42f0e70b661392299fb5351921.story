Georgia transportation officials scrambled to replace an embarrassing Atlanta highway sign Wednesday that was directing traffic to the city's famed 'aquairium.'

The unfortunate misspelling of 'aquarium' was an error on the sign maker's part.

According to The Atlanta Business Chronicle, the sign was replaced Wednesday night, but not before it became the subject of plenty of mockery.

At least the state's Department of Transportation had a sense of humor about the situation.

'We are aware,' DOT spokesperson Natalie Dale told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'Vanna, we'd like return a vowel.'

Even worse, the sign ended up on the Downtown Connector, which is the city's most traveled road.

Dale told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution the sign might have been changed out sooner, but they wanted to avoid doing work on the interstate during rush hour and forcing a lane closure.

Georgia Aquarium officials have not commented on the sign's error

The misspelled sign has been in place just under a week.

Aquarium officials have not responded to interview requests about the mix-up.

Taxpayers won't have to pay for the replacement as the error was not the fault of the DOT.
