Tragedy: Christopher Briggs, 25, got up in the middle of the night to go the toilet but skidded on the marble-like surface, falling flat on his back and head

A British holidaymaker was killed after walking across his Ibiza hotel room in socks and slipping and smashing his head on the shiny tiled floor.

Christopher Briggs, 25, got up in the middle of the night to go the toilet but skidded on the marble-like surface, falling flat on his back and head, an inquest heard.

He was found dead the following morning on the floor of the en suite bathroom by his roommate.

Mr Briggs, a plumber from Blackburn, had been for a night out with seven friends on the Balearic party island during a 'lads' holiday'.

The group had been drinking cocktails in a bar before making their way back to the two-star Hostal Apolo in San Antonio.

Hotel security cameras from outside the room showed Mr Briggs and roommate Paul Burke return to their room at around 2.44am on Sunday August 4.

Blackburn Coroners Court heard the video footage showed Mr Briggs to be 'drunk, as seen by the way he walked' and that he had difficulty opening the door.

At 9.24 the following morning, cameras showed Mr Burke dashing out of his room and calling for help from neighbouring rooms before paramedics arrived.

A post mortem examination carried out 
by the Spanish authorities revealed Mr Briggs suffered severe head 
injuries after falling to the floor, which they said could have 
been caused by excessive alcohol consumption.

Toxicology tests showed he had drunk the equivalent of seven or eight pints of beer.

However, recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Michael Singleton ruled there was 'no evidence of crass stupidity', declaring the incident a 'tragedy'.

The fall was said to have been 'serious enough to be the sole cause of death'.

Devastated Mr Burke told the court his friend 'looked alright' when they left the bar to head home.

Mr
Burke, 24, a part advisor for Volkswagen said: 'We went out as an eight
and then split into two groups of four. I wasn’t drunk but I had had a 
few.

'Briggsy looked alright to me but I have seem him many times and it wasn’t nothing more than usual to be honest. He was drinking cocktails, like what you do on holiday, he had maybe one pint.'

He added that he hadn’t heard anything during the night and only discovered his friend when he got up at around 9am, when he saw Mr Briggs lying on his back with some blood around his nose on the 'marbly and shiny' floor.

He said: 'I just saw Briggsy, he had his head out of the door and his body halfway in the bathroom. He was laid on the floor on his back, his feet were in the bathroom.

'It was very slippy, it was tiled. He was wearing grey or blue socks. You know those marble floors, you can slip across them.'

The party decided to cut their holiday short and arrived home three days earlier than planned.

Coroner Mr Singleton told Mr Briggs’ family: 'As a father myself I can’t begin to imagine the pain.

'The
tragedy seems to be amplified by the fact he was in Ibiza a long way 
from home, I can’t begin to imagine the trauma surrounding all that.

'This
is a nightmare beyond measure. I also offer my sympathies to Paul Burke
and the seven lads who had gone on holiday there couldn’t be anything 
better than with your mates, what could be better than that.

'There is no evidence of crass 
stupidity, he was a regular lad and went for a regular evening out, he 
simply slips on the floor. I’m sure you have asked "why Christopher? Why
my boy?".'

In a 
statement, Mr Briggs' father Stephen, also a plumber, paid tribute to 
his popular, sensible, and optimistic son, who he says had been looking 
forward to the Ibiza holiday for a year.

He said: ‘He was an easy-going, nice lad. Chris was an optimist too, to the extent that he had got his season ticket for Blackburn Rovers, thinking they were going to do great things.

'He was really looking forward to the holiday. We worked together for the last time on a bathroom in Manchester and he was really made up about going away. Everybody liked Christopher. He was a wonderful son and what happened was just a horrible thing.

'You never dream of this happening and it is something you never think you will experience. It is devastating losing your son, but I have also lost the person I worked with every day. Nobody would say anything ill of him.

'He loved his football and played five-a-side three times a week. He was sensible and quiet, but he liked to have a laugh with all his friends. Everybody will miss him so much.

'He was very, very popular. All our customers loved him. He just enjoyed life.'
