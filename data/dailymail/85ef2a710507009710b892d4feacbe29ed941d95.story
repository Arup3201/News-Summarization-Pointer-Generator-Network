It took Andy Murray a little bit of time, but eventually he subdued the player known as ‘Mad Dog’ on Thursday afternoon to make the third round of the French Open.

The Wimbledon champion gradually asserted his authority to win 6-3 6-1 6-3 against Marinko Matosevic on the court known as the ‘Bullring’ at Roland Garros.

It took Murray one hour and 56 minutes to progress with a canny display that drew the errors from the powerful Australian, playing his first match in a Grand Slam second round at the age of 28.

Cruise: Andy Murray eased into the third round of the French Open at Roland Garros

Acclaim: The Brit will face German Phillip Kohlschreiber in the third round in Paris

Easy: Murray claimed a 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 win over his Australian opponent on Court 1

The 27 year-old Scot will now face 
Germany’s ultra-solid Philipp Kohlschreiber, the world number 24, who 
overcame Denis Istomin in straight sets. That is likely to be 
considerably tougher as the German gives little away.

Murray
 served better than he had done in the first round against Andrey 
Golubev, and it was an encouraging sign that he managed to often pull 
out an ace or service winner on those occasions early in the match when 
the Australian got him into trouble.

Playing
 someone he gets on well with, the Scot’s mindset was a little scatty in
 the first set and there was plenty of chuntering at his bench.

Flying start: Murray broke early in all three sets and never looked back having gained his advantage

Pleasant: Murray was on Court 1 in Roland Garros, which is known as the Bullring

Team Murray: Kim Sears and the Wimbledon champion's back-room staff watch the action

The
 biggest alarm was when Matosevic forced three break points to pull him 
back to 4-4 in the first set, but he lacked the composure.

The
 only time Matosevic, who when serving  continually found his second 
serves to the backhand drilled past him,  broke was when he first served
 for the match at 5-2 in the third.

This
 was not a match that will linger long in the memory but he will have 
been pleased to get through the opening two rounds for the loss of one 
set. A fine balance between attack and defence will be required when he 
tackles the German on Saturday.
