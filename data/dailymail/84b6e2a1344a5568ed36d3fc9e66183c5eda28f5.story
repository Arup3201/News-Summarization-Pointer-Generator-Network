The number of armed police officers could drop dramatically due to a watchdog's plans to stop them conferring while writing up reports on shootings, it has been claimed.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission wants to make sure all armed police are separated from each other while writing up reports on shootings and the use of tasers.

But a leading figure in London's Metropolitan Police says the changes would see about half of armed police refuse to carry arms over fears they'll be 'criminalised' or put on trial for murder.

Police are currently given 48 hours after a shooting to produce a statement and can confer about events in the lead up to the incident.

But the IPCC want to stop officers conferring and force them to write up their report before they go off duty.

Commander Neil Basu, Met Police head of armed policing, says the changes would seriously hit his force's ability to tackle gun crime and place even more pressure on armed officers.

He said: 'We remain deeply concerned that the proposals will see officers being treated as suspects, separated from colleagues and questioned at what is always a traumatic and stressful time.

'Rather 
than assist an investigation we believe these proposals will greatly 
hinder the evidence-gathering process and prevent the best evidence from
 being obtained.

'Armed
 officers place themselves in harm's way for the good of the public on a 
daily basis. They are highly-professional and dedicated individuals who 
deserve our support.'

He fears more than 50 per cent of the Met
 Police's 2,000 armed officers would refuse to carry a weapon if the changes were brought in, and far 
fewer officers would apply for the roles.

The IPCC proposals come after the controversy surrounding the death of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police in Tottenham, north London in August 2011.

His killing led to protests in the area, which turned into the riots which spread across London and Britain that summer.

In that case, police officers spent eight hours together preparing their reports on the events leading up to shooting, days after the incident occurred.

In January this year, an inquest jury concluded by a majority of eight to two that Mr Duggan was lawfully killed.

The jury found unaminously that he had a gun with him in a minicab shortly before he was shot.

They found it was more likely than not that he had thrown the weapon just before he was killed. A gun was found about 20 feet from the scene.

The IPCC later questioned the police use of a 'hard-stop' tactic in the case, in which suspects are intercepted and confronted by armed officers.

Lawyers say the proposals could lead officers involved in shootings to refuse to take part in investigations for fear they'll end up on trial for murder.

Commander Basu said that the IPCC was protecting its own reputation after a survey found 80 per cent of armed officers lacked confidence in the changes.

The same survey found that two thirds of the Met police officers 'would think seriously' about handing in their weapons if the plans changes were approved.

The IPCC was accused of mishandling the probe in the so-called 'Plebgate' affair, in which cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell clashed with officers in Downing Street,  and the watchdog was criticised earlier this year over investigations into deaths in custody.

But the IPCC's director of investigations, Moir Stewart, has backed the proposals, which would need to be approved by Home Secretary Theresa May before being brought in

Mr Stewart said: 'Separating officers after an incident, as soon as it is practical to do so, allows them to provide their accounts and importantly, and often overlooked, it adds integrity to their accounts and protects them from accusations of a cover up or collusion.

'I believe that explainable inconsistencies are more credible than unexplainable consistencies.

'The proposals we have put forward... will increase public confidence in the police version of events, and help ensure our investigations are as robust and thorough as they can be.'
