A war veteran who became a high-profile fundraiser and public speaker today appeared in court charged with lying about having PTSD and cancer.

Former Royal Signalman Simon Buckden is accused of pretending to suffer from the illnesses in order to obtain money and other perks such as therapy.

He is also alleged to have falsely claimed to be a member of the SAS, Leeds Magistrates' Court was told.

Charges: Simon Buckden has been accused of lying about having PTSD and cancer

Buckden, 42, was chosen to carry the Olympic torch in 2012 after becoming a leading campaigner for victims of PTSD.

He also planned to run 100 marathons in 100 weeks in order to raise money for charity Help for Heroes.

But in April 2012, he said he had put the challenge on hold after being diagnosed with rectal cancer.

Buckden, from Leeds, was arrested in August last year on suspicion of fraud.

He has now been charged with seven counts of fraud by false representation.

The court heard that the charges date between October 2009 and December 2013.

Buckden, who served in Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda and Northern Ireland, spoke only to give his name, address and date of birth.

He will next appear at Leeds Crown Court in two weeks' time.

The former soldier was medically discharged from the Army in 2001, after 12 years of service.
