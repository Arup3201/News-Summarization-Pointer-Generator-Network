Regrets: Amy Roberts committed 30 drunken offences between the ages of 16 and 18

A young woman who was arrested 30 times for drunken attacks - including punching police officers - has warned against the dangers of binge drinking.

Amy Roberts, from Glasgow, told Closer magazine how alcohol transformed her from a shy schoolgirl into a violent criminal.

She said: 'Alcohol turned me into a 
crazed animal – I once punched a man in the face five times until he 
bled and enjoyed it. It disgusts me now. But I became addicted to the 
confidence alcohol gave me.'

Amy, now aged 21, started drinking when she was 14 blaming 'peer pressure' from her older friends.

As
a teenager she would often drink four times a week, taking her weekly 
intake to 162 units - the recommended weekly intake for a woman is 14.

On a typical night she would down a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20, a bottle of Lambrini and 10 vodka shots.

Lacking
in self-esteem as a teenager, she said the alcohol made her feel more 
'confident and chatty' and helped her 'fit in' with her friends.

However, it also led to her committing a number of violent offences.

The first was when she attacked a police officer who tried to take a bottle off her when she was caught drinking in the street.

She recalled: 'I bit her hand – I felt filled with 
rage and couldn't stop myself. She handcuffed me and I was kept in a 
police cell for the night.

'In the morning, I was horrified – I was a 
good girl, doing well at school and from a good family. I'd never been 
violent before.'

However, the incident was not enough 
to make Amy change her ways. In fact she said having a conviction for 
attacking a police officer was like 'a badge of honour' as her friends 
thought it was 'cool'.hh

Out of control: On an average night she would consume a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20, a bottle of Lambrini and 10 vodka shots

She went on to commit a string of other drunken offences - around one a month - between the ages of 16 to 18 including punching other police officers, security guards and her friends.

On one occasion, she viciously attacked a landlord who kicked her out of his pub for being under age.

'I punched him in the face, five times. He was bleeding 
from the nose. I was like an animal, shouting and screaming. I was 
actually getting a thrill out of it,' she said.

Amy admits she was 'out of control' and ignored the pleas from her 'angry and disappointed' mother, Helen, 59, a care worker, to give up alcohol.

The wake up call she needed only came after a five-and-a-half-month prison sentence she was given for punching another police officer in what was her 30th attack.

Upon her release in April 2011, she had counselling and agreed to stop seeing her old friends.

She now only drinks occasionally and volunteers in a clothes shop.

She left school with six A to C GCSE grades and would love to get a full-time paid job but fears her criminal record will always hold her back.

'My past will haunt me forever,' she said.

'I don't know if I'll ever work – I'll be branded a criminal forever and it makes me feel worthless.'

Amy is not alone in her teen addiction to alcohol as recent figures have revealed a surge in the number of girls under 15 consuming 11 units a week. There has also been a 50 per cent rise inthe past five years in fines issued to women under 21 for committing drunken violence.

Amy now hopes other girls will learn from her story and change their ways.

'I'm embarrassed and ashamed of my past. Binge-drinking might seem like fun, but it wrecks lives.'
