Jacqui Lambie has submitted a new draft law to parliament that would impose jail time and fines of up to $68,000 for adults who force children to wear a burqa in public.

The Private Members bill, if introduced, would also see severe fines and prison sentences for forcing an adult to wear a full face covering, with a fine of $34,000 or six months in prison.

Thirdly, the bill would make it illegal to wear the burqa in public unless the individual was wearing it for newly specified reasons.

In the bill, the Palmer United Senator wrote: ‘For basic security reasons and the need for assimilation, identity-concealing garments should not be allowed in Australian public or Parliament house.’

She proposed that on the spot fines should be issued to members of the public who breach the laws.

‘Any person who is deemed by a police officer to have worn any identity concealing garments in public unlawfully, will be issued with an on the spot fine or charged with an offence which carries a maximum fine of $3,400,' she said.

Ms Lambie added that the system would be ‘very simple and similar to way traffic infringements are handled by police'.

She said the only exception for wearing  facial coverings was in private places of worship, for reasons of anonymity and on health or professional grounds.

My Lambie also addressed the stunt in Monday, which saw three men attempt to enter Australia's Parliament House wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood, a niqab and a motorcycle helmet.

'The facial covering farce and stunt which occurred in Parliament house yesterday, was caused by a leadership failure created by the PM and the Liberal National Parties.'

It comes after a spate of anti-Muslim comments from the controversial senator.

Earlier this month, she argued that members of radical Islamic groups should be stripped of their right to vote and deported in a bid to combat home-grown terrorists.

'Now we're at war with the sharia extremists and Australia has been placed on a heightened terrorism alert - we can't have anyone hiding their identity in public. It now becomes an important national security issue,' Lambie said.

Lambie also recently went head-to-head with Maha Abdo from the Muslim Women's Association on Channel Seven's morning show Sunrise.

During the debate, she told Abdo, 'You have beautiful faces and it would be nice to be able see them.'
