Palace officials were relieved this weekend as no new revelations emerged over the party antics of   playboy Prince Harry in Las Vegas.

Two women are said to have approached PR guru Max Clifford about going on the record about his behaviour and the naked pictures of him taken on the boys-only trip.

One of the 'hot chicks' in his VIP suite offered 'explicit' images and mobile phone footage to U.S. TV and magazines for around £158,000.

Under fire: Prince harry could be reportedly grounded from flying Apache helicopter gunships if he misbehaves again

Royal team: Prince Charles in his role as Colonel in Chief of the Army Air Corps with his son Harry who flies Apache helicopters

It was Rupert Murdoch who ordered Sun executives to publish pictures of naked Prince Harry, it  was claimed today.

He reportedly did it against the wishes of the Royal Family because he wanted to send a warning shot to Lord Justice Leveson, the man leading the inquiry into press standards in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.

Defending the Sun's move,  Mr Murdoch posting on Twitter: 'Needed to demonstrate no such thing as free press in the UK. Internet makes mockery of these issues.'

The News Corporation boss also urged people to give Harry 'a break'.

He wrote: 'He may be on the public payroll one way or another, but the public loves him, even to enjoy Las Vegas.'

But Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt today said the Sun was not acting in the public interest when it published the photographs and 'personally' he could not see a justification for printing the images.

But he insisted that newspaper editors had to be free to make decisions on such issues.

Nothing has come out so far, but the 
prince will not escape the anger of defence chiefs who have reportedly 
warned him he could be grounded from flying Apache helicopter gunships.

The Ministry of Defence is said to be will be monitoring his behaviour and if he puts a foot wrong again he will lose his coveted role.

A royal aide is quoted in a Sunday tabloid:' 'You need a cool head and sound judgement to fly an Apache. He accepts he behaved stupidly and there is no place for stupidity in an Apache cockpit.

'Anymore of this and he will be grounded. These are big destructive machines. You need an ice cool brain and have to know how to behave.'

Harry is likely to be sent to Afghanistan as planned for a second tour, but Army chiefs are reviewing his career after the Prince was pictured naked with a girl at a party with women in his suite.

The group played a stripping game and someone in the party is thought to have captured the images of the naked prince on a camera phone.

Meanwhile, it was claimed that Prince Charles has banned his son from any more holidays with his male friends.

Charles told Harry he can only go on trips with him and his wife Camilla or with a 'responsible adult', according to a Sunday tabloid.

They are expected to meet face-to-face in the next few days. Harry is thought to be spending the Bank Holiday staying with friends back in the UK.

A royal insider told the Sunday Star: 'The general view is Harry is drinking in the last chance saloon.'
