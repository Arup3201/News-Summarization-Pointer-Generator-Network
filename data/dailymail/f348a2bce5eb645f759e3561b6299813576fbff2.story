A stunned couple whose first child was born though a pioneering IVF technique are expecting their second baby after conceiving naturally.

Gemma and Simon Potter tried in vain to start a family for four years before becoming the first parents in the UK to have a child using a new IVF procedure.

But two years after the arrival of daughter Isabella, the couple were shocked to discover Mrs Potter was pregnant again - after a natural conception.

The new addition to the Potter family is due on Boxing Day.

Simon and Gemma Potter are expecting their second child this December after conceiving naturally, two years after their daughter Isabella was born via IVF

The couple said they were shocked when they discovered the 29-year-old was pregnant. Mrs Potter said: 'I couldn't believe it when it read positive. I screamed "two pink lines" at Simon, and then I didn't speak for about 20 minutes out of shock.'

Mrs Potter, 29, said: 'We both really wanted children and it was the natural thing for us after getting married and buying a house together

'It was really hard when we found out we couldn’t have children. All I heard the doctor say was "impossible" and I zoned out from the reasons why.

Fertility
 expert Dr Geetha Venkat said in her career which has spanned 20 years, 
she has heard of couple's concieving naturally following IVF.

She
 said there are two different circumstances when it can happen. The 
first is in instances with couples like the Potters, who have conceived 
through IVF and go on to have a second baby naturally.

And the second is when couples' IVF fails, yet they fall pregnant naturally later.

Dr
 Venkat, of Harley Street Fertility Clinic, said: 'I don't know the 
specific explanation for his, but I have a feeling that because of the 
hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy, somehow it makes the 
ovaries, eggs and function of the reproductive system better, leaving 
couples able to concieve naturally.

'It is as though the ovaries are stimulated as a result of the pregnancy.

'I
 have seen a few cases in each instance, where a couple already has a 
child through IVF, as well as the more rare occurrence, when a couple's 
IVF has failed.'

'I’d peed on so many sticks and every month I’d get hopeful. I’d think of dresses and pick out dresses in my head, but every time the result was the same.'

The couple, from Wigan in Lancashire, decided to try and conceive using in vitro fertilisation (IVF) - a process where an egg is fertilised by sperm outside the body.

But they were chosen for an NHS trial into a new form of IVF using an incubator with in-built microscopes, meaning a fertilised embryo would remain undisturbed during the crucial conception.

Mrs Potter underwent the pioneering procedure at Care in Manchester.

Previously, an embryo would have been removed from the incubator several times for doctors to examine it under a microscope, creating risks that may have caused the IVF to be unsuccessful.

But the new technique uses a time-lapse system that allows embryologists to see how the embryo develops so the best one is used to bring on conception.

The couple were given the time-lapse video to watch the six-day artificial conception unfold in just a matter of seconds.

'It was awesome to look at and a really special way of marking the pregnancy,' said Mrs Potter, who owns her own cake business.

'People can usually see their baby develop through scan pictures but not from as early on as this.

'It’s amazing to watch it and think how did that turn into my little girl who’s now running around like a maniac.'

But
 two years after the birth of her first child Isabella, Mrs Potter was 
baffled to learn she was pregnant for the second time after conceiving 
naturally.

The couple's daughter Isabella, pictured left and right, was born after Mrs Potter was given a radical new form of IVF, having been told by doctors it was 'impossible' for her to conceive naturally

She said: 'Everything started tasting of mushrooms, which is what happened when I fell pregnant with Isabella.

'I didn’t believe for one minute that I might be pregnant but I was late as well so I bought a test.

'I couldn’t believe it when it read positive. I screamed ‘two pink lines’ at Simon, and then I didn’t speak for about 20 minutes out of shock.'

The family are hoping to raise awareness of the pioneering treatment for other couples who are struggling to get pregnant.

Mr Potter, 35, an expert software engineer, said: 'It was so surreal for us.

'Our aim is to raise awareness and help some other families in the future.

'We see it as a way of paying back for what we received from the IVF treatment.'
