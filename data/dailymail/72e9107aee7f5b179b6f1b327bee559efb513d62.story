The United Nations is set to introduce a treaty cracking down on the $60billion global business of illicit trading in small arms.

The move is aimed at curbing violence in some of the most troubled corners of the world, but has unsurprisingly ruffled feathers with pro-gun activists in the US, including those of the National Rifle Association.

They have denounced the treaty as a threat to their constitutional right to bear arms.

Controversial topic: Pro-gun campaigners say the treaty as a threat to their constitutional right to bear arms (file picture)

'Without apology, the NRA wants no 
part of any treaty that infringes on the precious right of lawful 
Americans to keep and bear arms,' NRA executive vice president Wayne 
LaPierre told the UN this month.

'Any treaty that includes civilian firearms ownership in its scope will be met with the NRA's greatest force of opposition.'

Fellow
critic John Bolton, who was President George W. Bush's ambassador to 
the UN, wrote that gun-control advocates 'hope to use restrictions on 
international gun sales to control gun sales at home.'

But
what both sides ignore is a well-enshrined legal principle that says no
treaty can override the Constitution or US laws, according to theÂ  
Associated Press.

Campaign issue: Barack Obama, left, has suggested stiffer gun regulations while Mitt Romney, right, yesterday said he did not think the laws should change

In fact, a first draft of the treaty circulated in New York this week has been criticised by arms-control activists for containing too many loopholes.

For instance, it does not include a proposed ban on ammunition trade.

Gun activists are standing firm in near-blanket opposition to such a ban, as last Friday's deadly Aurora, Colo., theater shooting rampage heightens interest in the deliberations and raises the stakes.

Barack Obama supports the treaty effort but has not talked about it on the presidential campaign trail.

Equally, presumptive Republican candidate Mitt Romney has not addressed the issue but broadly opposes what he sees as overreach by the UN on many fronts.

He told a town hall in Ohio last week that he was 'not willing to give the United Nations sovereignty in any way or form' over US citizens or law.

This week, they clashed long-distance when Mr Obama suggested stiffer gun regulations in a speech to the National Urban League and Mr Romney argued in an NBC interview from London, where he is traveling, that America does not need new gun laws.

The Constitution's Second Amendment offers broad protection for weapons ownership by civilians. As recently as 2008, the Supreme Court affirmed this when it struck down a ban on handguns in the District of Columbia, ruling that individuals have a constitutional right to keep guns for self-defence and other purposes.

The rule that treaty obligations may not infringe on individual constitutional protections and rights goes back at least to a 1920 ruling that a migratory bird treaty with Canada, which prohibited the hunting or capturing of certain birds, was an unconstitutional interference with states' rights under the 10th Amendment.

Treaties are government-to-government agreements and do not subject citizens of one nation to laws of another or to those of an outside body.

The UN resolution that authorised the drafting of the small arms treaty recognises the right of nations 'to regulate internal transfers of arms' and says nothing in the treaty that emerges will affect 'constitutional protections on private ownership' of firearms.

There are many other court rulings spelling out the limits of treaties.

If an act of Congress is inconsistent with a treaty obligation, the law passed by Congress prevails, which has led to various international treaties with Indian tribes being quashed.

A proposed treaty to regulate exports and imports of small weapons has been on the UN agenda since 2006, when Mr Bush ordered a veto.

Mr Obama got the process rolling again in 2010. So far, 152 nations have participated in the drafting and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has pledged to push for Senate ratification once there is a final document.

But it may be an empty gesture.

Treaties must be ratified by two-thirds of the 100-member Senate, or 67 votes. With pressure mounting from the gun lobby, led by the politically powerful NRA, a letter opposing such a treaty has already gained the signatures of well over 50 senators.

Even so, fears have spread online lately, with some pro-gun activists even suggesting the Obama administration was capitalising on the Colorado killings to advance its case for gun control and others portraying it as a plot by the UN to expand its reach.

The controversy fuels suggestions by many conservatives that Mr Obama ultimately hopes to ban possession of firearms, even though he has stood up for protecting Second Amendment rights.

Some gun-rights advocates acknowledge that a treaty by itself would not be likely to undercut these Second Amendment guarantees.

'But there are all kinds of ways that international law insinuates itself into US law even when there's not a formal ratification,' said David Kopel, research director for the conservative Independence Institute, based in Colorado.

For instance, he suggests a treaty could affect the shipment of certain gun parts to US manufacturers.

But Gabor Rona, international legal director of Human Rights First, said: 'There is no doubt that the Constitution is superior to any international treaties.'
