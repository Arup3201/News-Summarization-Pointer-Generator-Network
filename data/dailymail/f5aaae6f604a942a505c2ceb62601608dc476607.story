The voice of serial killer Fred West will be heard on television for the first time next week in a chilling new documentary.

The House of Horrors murderer’s story is being told in a Channel 5 documentary The Unseen Fred West Confessions to mark the 20th anniversary of the investigation.

Actor Charlie Walters plays the builder but lip-syncs West’s actual words from the interviews recorded by the police.

Scroll down for video.

Killer couple: Fred and Rose West were responsible for nine murders at 25 Cromwell Street, the Gloucester house they moved into eight months after their January 1972 wedding

West, a father of at least eight children, casually recalls how he strangled his 16-year-old daughter Heather, one of nine victims found at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, the home she shared with his second wife Rose who he married in January 1972.

Five of their victims at Cromwell Street, which was demolished in 1996, were beheaded and dismembered before they were buried in the cellar.

West tells police: ‘I brought my two hands up and grabbed her around the neck. But I didn’t grab her round the neck to choke her or nothing. All I was going to do was to grab her round the neck and shake her.’

Portraits of evil: Rose and Fred West. Despite all the evidence including that now provided beyond the grave from Fred West, Rose West continues to deny responsibility for any of the 10 murders for which she was convicted

Fred West was interviewed 161 times by the police following his arrest in February 1994. He casually told them how his wife Rose cut up their daughter and put her in a dustbin

He confesses that he was too strong: ‘I can undo three-quarter nuts without a spanner.’

West says that his wife was responsible for cutting up their daughter: ‘All the mess that Rose got herself into, I took the f***ing rap for. So anyway, I said: “Look, you’ll have to tell me exactly what happened.”

‘She said Heather was cut up. I never felt so ill in all my life. I said: “What on earth did you cut her up for?” She said she wouldn’t fit in the dustbin. Now the thing that makes it hard, that she cut Heather up and chucked her in a f***ing dustbin. Our daughter in a dustbin.’

Serial killer and his home: Fred West in a police mugshot and 25 Cromwell Street, the Gloucester home, where nine victims were buried in the cellar. The house was demolished in 1996 and replaced by a footpath

On November 22, 1995 Rose West was convicted of 10 murders and sentenced to life in prison. She denies all the allegations.

West was interviewed 161 times by the police after his arrest in February 1994 and the show features some excerpts of the man who kept souvenirs – a finger joint or kneecap – from his victims.

West never faced justice and hanged himself in his Winson Green prison cell on January 1, 1995, aged 53.

Steve Warr, the executive producer of The Unseen Fred West Confessions, said the film’s makers defended the programme against allegations of sleaze and sensationalism.

He said: ‘The show is not being made in a sensationalist manner. We are presenting, factually, information which already exists, which is in the public interest.’
