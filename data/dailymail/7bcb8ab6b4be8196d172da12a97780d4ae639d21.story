A cycling lane in Bristol has been likened to an obstacle course as it weaves its way round several trees and lamp posts. 

Bristol City Council painted white lines on a section of pavement in Nelson Street to create a contra-flow cycle lane, allowing bike riders to pedal against the prevailing traffic in relative safety. 

The council moved the cycle lane from the roadway due to building works which narrowed the width of the carriageway forcing them to move the facility which allowed riders to pedal the opposite way to traffic.

However, the strangely shaped cycle lane is not the oddest in Britain, where there is one of just six feet in length.   

A cyclist was left in disbelief when he spotted what is thought to be the UK's shortest cycle lane - at just six foot.

It appears next to a shared space pavement for pedestrians and cyclists, but has left riders baffled as to why they even bothered.

The lane appears out of nowhere, with no other cycle paths in sight, before stopping abruptly just a few feet later when the road hits a junction.

The cycle lane, in Frampton Cotterell, Bristol is only six feet long and believed to be the UK's shortest cycle lane

Cyclist David Stone spotted the new lane in Frampton Cotterell, Bristol.

He said: 'Is this the shortest cycle lane in the UK?

'I have no idea how long it has been there but a new mini roundabout has recently been located in Heather Avenue, so it may be that they had some paint left over.'

This cycle lane in Beetwell Street, Chesterfield, is only 13 feet long. It was painted in April this year by Derbyshire County Council but has already been slammed by the town's cycling community

The bike lane on Ridgeway in Plymouth, Devon was created in December 2012 and is just 8ft 2ins, barely longer than a bike. It was defended by Plymouth council as they said it did not cost them anything

Meanwhile, this one in Plymouth, Devon, pictured, was ridiculed by cyclists when it was unveiled

South Gloucestershire Council said the cycle lane, situated on a junction between Heather Avenue and Park Lane, had nothing to do with them.

A spokesman said: 'It is believed that it is there to protect cyclists who have returned to the road.

'In the planning application for the development, there is an agreement to provide for safety at road junctions.'

The cycle lane was created by developer Barratt Homes, who inserted the lane when completing a nearby housing estate as cyclists join the road from a shared pavement.

A spokesman for Barratt Homes said: 'The cycleway markings are on the road as part of the termination on the shared footpath and cycleway along Heather Avenue and have been installed as part of the technical requirements of South Gloucestershire Highways under the planning consent and road adoption agreement.'

This is not the first time ridiculously short bike lanes have been marked out on British roads.

Meanwhile, council officials in Cardiff spent an estimated £2,000 painting this stretch of roadway red

In December 2012, bungling council workers created a bike lane, measuring just 8ft 2ins, on Ridgeway in Plymouth, Devon.

A council spokesman said the path did not council anything and was added because it alerted cyclists to the left hand turn into a new facility.

The 8ft stretch of cycle lane in Cardiff city centre cost an estimated £2,000 when it was completed in 2010

Elsewhere, council workers in Cardiff were criticised for building an 8ft bike lane in 2010 at the estimated cost of £2,000.

Welsh cyclists were left baffled with the logic behind the lane when an official told them it was to 'highlight the interface between the eastbound carriageway and the beginning of a new contraflow facility'.

Most recently, cyclists ridiculed a decision to create a path - sandwiched between two junctions - in Chesterfield.

The 13 foot cycle lane in Beetwell Street in Chesterfield was developed in April this year and Derbyshire county council bosses said it offered a useful link in a much longer bike route in the town.

But users said officials could have saved themselves the bother of marking its start and finish with painted signs – which are squeezed in next to each other on the small patch of pavement.
