This was the moment a thief was knocked almost senseless when a brave customer threw a heavy metal fire extinguisher at his head after he burst into a petrol station with a lethal looking metal spike in his hand and threatened to stab anyone who got in his way.

Suspect Ardon Ortega Montano, 42, dashed into the petrol station in the city of Lora del Rio, in the south Spanish province of Seville, shortly after it opened in the morning and warned the customers to stay out of the way as he rushed over to the till.

Although terrified the cashier can be seen pushing the silent alarm as the robber forces his way behind the counter and demands the till be opened, and then grabs the money.  

Threatening: Robbery suspect Ardon Ortega Montano, 42, dashed into a petrol station in Spain armed with a spike

Dangerous: The suspect threatens a customer, in an orange top, with the spike

Brave: A customer in a blue top approaches from the left, armed with a fire extinguisher

Decisive: The customer rams the extinguisher into the suspect's head

But as he attempts to leave, waving the spike at those in the shop, the shop's CCTV system shows a customer throwing a fire extinguisher full force at his head, allowing a second man to grab the hand with the spike. They quickly push him to the floor.

Together the pair managed to hold onto the suspect, delaying him enough so that by the time he finally managed to flee, police who turned up a short while later were able to easily track him down and arrest him.

Police spokesman Adiel Perea said: ‘He had not gone very far. After getting his image from the CCTV cameras he was quickly spotted nearby and arrested.’

He has been remanded in custody while the investigation continues.
