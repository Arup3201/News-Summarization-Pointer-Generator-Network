A pod of killer whales that became trapped underneath the sea ice off the Canadian coast has been freed.

Locals in Quebec's Far North had rallied to help the dozen whales in a story that mirrored a 1988 scenario in Alaska that was portrayed on the big screen by Drew Barrymore in the 2012 film Big Miracle.

Locals in the small fishing village of Inukjuak raced to the scene some 30km off the coast after the mammals were seen gathering around a single hole in the ice - slightly bigger than a pickup truck - in a desperate bid to get oxygen.

It was feared that the small hole would freeze up causing the whales to drown but fortunately changing tides caused the ice to shift creating a clear route for them to swim to the safety of the open sea.

Freed: A killer whale surfaces through a small hole in the ice around 30 km off the Canadian coast near Inukjuak, in Northern Quebec. The pod of 12 whales have now swum to safety after tides caused the ice to shift opening up a channel to the open sea

Dire situation: Desperate for oxygen, the whales were seen surfacing from the small 
hole in the thick ice. The animals normally stay underwater for between 
three and eight minutes at a time

Help: The local mayor has asked the government to intervene and send an ice breaker. The trapped orcas appeared to be in distress

Local businessman Tommy Palliser said
two hunters reported that the waters had opened up around the area 
where the cornered whales had been bobbing frantically for air.

He said: 'They confirmed that the 
whales were no longer there and there was a lot of open water. It's 
certainly good news - that's good news for the whales.'

Locals said the whales had been trapped around a single, truck-sized 
breathing hole for at least two days. A recent sudden drop in 
temperature may have caught the whales off guard, leaving them trapped 
under the ice.

Palliser said the winds seemed to shift overnight, pushing the floating ice further away from the shore.

The cornered animals were first seen Tuesday and appeared to have less energy by late Wednesday, Palliser said.

Inukjuak Mayor Peter Inukpuk has said Canada's Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans informed him that government icebreakers were too far from 
the area to smash the ice to free the whales.

Palliser said locals had agreed to try to enlarge the existing breathing
hole and cut a second opening using chainsaws and drills.

'We certainly had our prayers with them last night during our meeting,' he said. 
Ice-trapped marine mammals are not unusual in the region.

Mayor Peter Inukpuk had urged the 
Canadian government on Wednesday to send an icebreaker as soon as 
possible to crack open the ice and help them find open water.

The Department of Fisheries and Oceans had been preparing to send officials to assess the situation.

Location: The whales became trapped under the sea ice some 30km from the 
coast in Hudson Bay by the small fishing village of Inukjuak 1,500km 
north of Montreal

Dozens of villagers had made the one-hour 
snowmobile ride on Tuesday to see the unusual spectacle. They snapped 
photos and shot video footage of the killer whales surfacing in the 
opening - and even thrusting themselves skyward while gasping for air.

Like
all marine mammals killer whales don't breathe underwater and get their
oxygen through their blowhole when they rise to the surface.

They
normally stay underwater for between three and eight minutes but have 
been known to stay submerged for up to 30 minutes at a time.

By comparison sperm whales and bottlenose whales can stay under for as long as 90 to 120 minutes respectively.

Killer whales are among the fastest swimming marine mammals and can reach speeds of up to 28 mph but only for short periods.

They normally cruise at around 8 mph and can sustain such speed for long periods of time.

Unlike
narwhals, belugas and bowheads, they are not an ice-loving species and 
generally head north to hunt during the summer months but return before 
the ice moves in.

Mr Inukpuk believed the sudden drop in temperature recently caught the orcas off guard, leaving them boxed in under the ice.

He suggested that the pod, which 
consists of two adults and a number of younger whales, could be a single
family and that they were clearly in trouble.

Speaking before the whales were able to make their break to safety, he said: 'It appears from time to time that they panic.

'Other times they are gone for a long time, probably looking for another open space, which they are not able to find.'

Locals said the killer whales were seen thrusting themselves skyward while gasping for air.

One woman who made the journey to the gap in the ice said even a curious polar bear approached the hole amid the commotion.

Siasie Kasudluak said the bear was shot by a local hunter for its meat.

Martha Asudluak, 21, had hitched a ride 
on a snowmobile on Wednesday morning to go out to see them and got to about
three metres from the water's edge.

She told Canada's CBC news: 'I saw the big head popping out of the waters ... I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

'They kind of looked like they needed
help. They're sharing this small little hole. They were probably 
searching for a way to go out, but at the moment they have no other 
choice but to stay there because it's all ice â€” all over.'

Kasudluak said the hole appeared to 
be shrinking in the freezing temperatures. Inukpuk believes the sudden 
drop in temperature recently caught the orcas off guard, leaving them 
boxed in under the ice.

The whale's plight mirrored that of three gray whales which became packed under ice in the Beaufort Sea near Point Barrow in northern Alaska in 1988.

That incident was the inspiration for last year's film Big Miracle starring Drew Barrymore as a Greenpeace 
environmental activist who led to effort to bring media and political 
attention to the matter while John Krasinski portrayed a local 
television reporter.

Local villagers, who came to watch, had called for help from the Canadian government to free the pod

The effort to free the whales, dubbed Operation Breakthrough, gained national attention and eventually the State Department enlisted the help from the Soviet Union to use two ice breaker ships.

One of the whales died while the effort was underway but the two remaining were able to escape after the Soviet ships cleared away a path through the ice.
