One year after their escape from a ramshackle house in Cleveland where they had been held captive for years, Amanda Berry and Georgina DeJesus were honored at the annual Hope Awards in Washington DC Tuesday night.

The gleaming ballroom at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, which hosted the event organized by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, erupted in applause when the two young woman took the stage.

The honorees briefly addressed the large crowd, with Berry tearfully delivering a simple yet powerful message: 'Never give up hope.'

On May 6, 2013, Berry, DeJesus and a third woman, Michelle Knight, were freed by police from Ariel Castro's real-life house of horrors where the three women had been repeatedly beaten, raped and kept in chains for more than a decade.

Although the survivors are now grown women, they were honored by the Center for Missing and Exploited Children because they were kidnapped by Castro, a school bus driver, when they were teenagers.

Earlier Tuesday, Berry and DeJesus had lunch with Vice President  Joe Biden , and also got to meet President Barack Obama, according to The Plain Dealer.

During the Hope Awards ceremony, an emotional DeJesus and Berry, both dressed in festive evening gowns, took the stage surrounded by their relatives.

‘It’s an honor to be here tonight,’ Berry said. ‘It is really special to be here with Gina and our families. It means more than you’ll ever know.’

The 28-year-old woman, who had spent a decade of her life in bondage, had to pause after being overcome with emotion.

‘If I could say only one thing,’ she continued, ‘it would be this: Never give up hope.’

When it was DeJesus' turn to address the crowd of about 500 guests, the 24-year-old also spoke about the importance of keeping hope alive against all odds.

John Walsh, the host of America's Most Wanted who introduced the two honorees, called Berry and DeJesus 'a lightning bolt of hope' for other families.

He also mentioned the plight of Michelle Knight, saying that no one was even looking for her because she was kidnapped at age 21.

Knight, Berry and DeJesus’ getaway and subsequent recounting of the horrors they suffered during their time in captivity drew international attention.

Ariel Castro pleaded guilty to hundreds of charges including kidnapping, rape and murder for forcing Knight to miscarry. He was sentenced to life without parole, plus 1,000 years, but hanged himself in his cell in September.

Craig Weintraub, one of two attorneys who represented Castro, said that Castro decided not to kill the three women because he had become close to the child he had with Berry.

The women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004. Berry was 14, DeJesus was 16 and Knight was 20. They were rescued from Castro's run-down house May 6, 2013, after Berry broke through a screen door.

Police found DeJesus and Knight upstairs where there were bedrooms outfitted with chains and locks.

According to police documents released this week, Berry told authorities after she escaped: ‘He [Castro] didn't lock the door, he always locks the doors. I thought it was a trick but I had to take that chance.’

Another document recounted a conversation Castro had with a police officer shortly after he was arrested. The officer, who had known Castro since childhood, asked him how he had kept the women for so long without anyone finding out.

‘It was hard, but it was my secret, and I'm glad that it is over,’ Castro told the officer. ‘Now I can die in prison, but I'm a victim, too.’

Castro told investigators that he was sexually abused by a man when he was a young boy, the documents said.

Berry and DeJesus said in statements Monday that they were thankful for support from their families and the community and that they growing in many ways.

Michelle Knight said in an interview on NBC's Today Show Monday that Castro deserves forgiveness because she'd want to be forgiven if she did wrong, and ‘that's the way of life.’

She added, ‘He is a human being and every human being needs to be loved,’ even if he did wrong.

On the last page of her new memoir, Finding Me: A Decade of Darkness, a Life Reclaimed, Knight writes: 'If I don't forgive him, then it'll be like he imprisoned me twice. Forgiveness is the only way I can truly reclaim my life.'

Knight recounted being chained up, beaten, raped and mentally tortured for years by Castro, who pointed to high-profile searches by the families of co-prisoners Berry and DeJesus as proof that no one cared about her.

Those words
 hit home for her, she wrote. 'Even if I escape from this bastard, I 
often thought, what kind of life will be waiting for me in the real 
world? After this mess is over, who will really be there to love me?'

Knight,
 who is changing her name to Lillian Rose Lee, referred to Castro only 
as 'dude' throughout the book, but wrote that she cried after hearing 
about his suicide.

Knight's new book was released Tuesday to coincide with the one-year anniversary of her escape. Berry and DeJesus are collaborating with two Washington Post reporters on a book due out next year.

Charles Ramsey, the man credited with helping the women escape from the house, also has written a book.

On Tuesday night, Ms Knight went on CNN's AC360 to talk about her experiences in Castro's home, telling Anderson Cooper that she was 'the punching bag' for the kidnapper.

Knight, who was lured by Castro with the promise of 'puppies,' said that the school bus driver treated her worse than the other two captive girls, beating her day after day.

The 33-year-old survivor recalled that Berry got better food, blankets, 'basically whatever she wanted, except for home.'

Singled out: Knight, 33, said that she was Castro's punching bag and was treated worse than Amanda Berry because Castro was fascinated with the younger girl

‘He had a fascination with her, more than me,’ Knight said. ‘She was the wife-type person. I was the punching bag.’

When in April 2004 Castro kidnapped then-14-year-old Gina DeJesus, he chained her to Knight. The two captives would form a close bond, encouraging one another in order to keep hope alive that one day their torment will be over.

Knight's toughest test came when Amanda Berry went into labor with Castro's child.

It was her job to deliver the baby, and Castro had warned her that if the newborn died, he would kill her.

Berry's baby came out of her womb not breathing, but the amateur midwife helped revive the newborn.

Throughout the entire decade-long ordeal, Knight remained defiant in the face of daily beatings and humiliations.

‘All my life, I was made to feel insecure, like I was worthless,’ she recalled. ‘And for the first time in my life, I stood up to a person that was a demeaning person.’

She added, ‘And it felt good to stand up for myself, [because] I never did before.’

The following statements were released separately Monday by Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus about the one-year anniversary of their escape from a house in Cleveland.

Amanda Berry:

I would like to thank all the people who have helped and supported my family and me. You have changed our lives in ways you'll never know.

On this day, we decided that the right place for us to be was with other families who have gone through what our family has gone through. I want these families to know they will always have a special place in our hearts.

So much has happened this past year. I have grown. I am strong. And I have so much to live for, to look forward to. The future is bright.

Gina DeJesus:

I want to thank everyone who donated to the Courage Fund and sent gifts to me. You have made such a difference in my life.This past year has been amazing, full of healing and hope. I am spending time with my family and working with Amanda on a book that we are really excited about.I have also been enjoying new experiences, such as learning how to use new technology and how to drive. Thanks for continuing to respect my privacy and that of my family.
