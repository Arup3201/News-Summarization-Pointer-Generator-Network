Jodi Arias is making thousands of dollars by selling art that she continues to make from behind bars but now that Ebay has banned her from their site, she is relying on a loyal group of friends who are running a different website for the sales.

The fact that she and her family members were profiting from the notoriety she earned from the killing of her ex boyfriend Travis Alexander has not stopped apparent fans from shelling out over $3,000 for a piece of Arias' artwork.Â 

Earlier today, her mother confirmed that the colored pencil drawings made by Arias were being sold through a third party. When asked if the drawings- consisting of portraits of unidentified women or famous dead celebrities like Frank Sinatra and Grace Kelly- were selling, Sandra Arias said: 'Oh yea.'

This comes on the same day that a friend of the suspected murderer admitted that she was posting messages to Twitter on behalf of Arias as she remains behind bars during her trial.

Her friend Donovan Bering told a local Fox affiliate that she and the 32-year-old accused killer speak by phone most nights and discuss different parts of the day's court dealings.

'She'll call and say "I have a quote." We'll talk about it. Sometimes she says "let's tweet." And then she'll say "no let's not do it,"' Ms Bering told MyFoxPhoenix.

'I think it's a way of her getting out her frustration, because she doesn't have a chance to say much.'

In the 20 tweets that they have posted
as of Thursday night, the duo- or simply Ms Bering- have gone after the
critics on the internet and on the airwaves. Nancy Grace and others at 
CNN's HLN, which they said was 'an acronym for Haters Love Negativity'.

A
consistent theme of the tweets, however, has been the promotion of her 
website where she is now selling the artwork that she makes behind bars.
All four pieces that have already been sold all went for $1,000 or 
more, with her portrait of Grace Kelly earning a whopping $3,050.

Silver lining? Arias, speaking through her friend with access to social media, said that the Ebay ban didn't hurt sales

Promotion: The drawing sales are supposedly helping fund her family's stay in Arizona during the trial

Self aware: Arias supporters are the ones in charge of her website and Twitter feed

'Ebay has banned all listings of my artwork. The silver lining in making my art more difficult to obtain is that it keeps increasing in value,' Ms Bering wrote on the Jodi Arias Twitter in February.

The money earned through the pictures and the donations accrued on her website is all said to be going towards the expenses of her relatives who have been a constant presence in the Phoenix courtroom as they have uprooted from their California hometown for the duration.

Though technically neither her communication via Ms Bering and their Twitter feed nor her shipment of the artwork to a third party for sale are illegal, they are both frowned upon by the sheriff's office.

'This doesn't sit well with us,' Sergeant Brandon Jones from the Maricopa County Sheriff's office told The Associated Press.

'She could draw those pictures, but I 
can't tell you whether they are truly hers or whether this is someone 
trying to make money off her.'

Many
pundits have likened the dramatics surrounding her case to that of 
Casey Anthony, and the questions raised about income revenue streams is 
also similar in the two cases.

In
Florida, Anthony is currently involved in a new legal battle as 
concerned public opposition groups are fighting to prevent her from 
selling the story of her daughter's death for a profit.

There have not been any formal petitions put into place in the Arias case to stop her from trading on her now-infamous name, and the next step in the trial comes on Friday when psychotherapist Alyce LaViolette returns to the stand.
