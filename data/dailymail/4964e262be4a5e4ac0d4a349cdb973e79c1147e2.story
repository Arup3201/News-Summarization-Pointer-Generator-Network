Hardy swimmers braved freezing temperatures to take part in a traditional outdoor swim.

As most people were wrapped up warm in hats and coats, about 400 people plunged into the Parliament Hill Lido in north London for the annual event.

Today, the Outdoor Swimming Society held the seventh December Dip and endured 6C water in the unheated pool to complete a rapid two-width dash.Â

Some swimmers donned Santa costumes for the festivities but others jumped in the water in just a pair of Speedos.

To the sound of the North London Brass Band, they jumped in the outdoor pool and gasped in shock as they hit the chilly water.

Poet Richard Scott will be writing couplets and haikus about the swim, and there was also a Best Dressed Dipper competition.

After finishing the icy challenge, participants warmed up with some festive tipples and snacks as well as being awarded a December Dip swimming hat.

As if the challenge of ploughing across two widths of the 60 metre by 28 metre pool was not enough, some people took it to the next level by swimming two full lengths.

Dubbed the Arctic Adventurers, they signed up in advance to the invitation-only swim.

As well as the chilly challenge, the Outdoor Swimming Society hold regular events throughout the year.
