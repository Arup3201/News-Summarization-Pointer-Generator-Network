Women trying to donate to Cancer Research UK as part of the #nomakeupselfie craze have found themselves accidentally trying to adopt a polar bear, it was revealed today.

The fault has been happening when some givers' smartphones autocorrect the word ‘BEAT’ to read ‘BEAR’ and end up sending a message of interest in adoption to the World Wildlife Fund.

In addition, £18,625 donated during the 
craze has accidentally been sent to the United Nations agency Unicef by people texting ‘DONATE’ rather than ‘BEAT’, followed by the number 70099.

Getting involved: Australian singer Samantha Jade, whose mother has cancer, posted a no make-up selfie

'I woke up like dis': Cheryl Cole joined the trend by posting a picture of herself on Instagram, despite appearing to be wearing a hint of eye make-up in the snap and not including the hashtag #nomakeupselfie

Tens of thousands of women have taken to posting photos of their make-up free faces online, alongside a £3 donation, which has helped raise more than £8million for the cancer charity.

And Unicef
 is now working with Cancer Research UK to transfer the 
mistakenly-donated funds, while the WWF said no money was taken from 
people who had enquired about adoption by mistake.

A
 Unicef UK spokesman told BBC News: ‘Unicef is not responsible for this 
error, however we've been working hard to find a resolution to the 
situation for those affected.

‘"DONATE
 to 70099" is an SMS keyword and shortcode combination that Unicef have 
sole use of, specifically for any members of the public who contact us 
and wish to donate to us via SMS.’

The
 WWF stated any texts accidentally it received would not become 
donations helping to protect polar bears, because the charity has ‘human
 operators calling people back to confirm adoptions’.

A
 spokesman said: ‘We wish Cancer Research UK every success in their 
campaign and their goals. Polar bear selfies are harder to come by, 
though, as far as we are aware, none wear make-up.’

Mistake: Some people have even made an enquiry about adopting a polar bear from the World Wildlife Fund, after their smartphones autocorrected the word 'BEAT' to read 'BEAR'

Reasoning: Dancer Felixy Splits says it's not only important to raise awareness but to donate anything you can

Nobody seems to know when it started 
or why, but the take-up of the #nomakeupselfie craze has been 
astonishing, perhaps even more so as it was a trend that was not started
 by the charity.

Celebrities such as models Amy Willerton and Helen Flanagan and singer Kym Marsh have joined in.

The
craze was not orchestrated by Cancer Research, but it quickly 
uploaded its own make-up-free selfie of a staff member holding a sign 
reading: ‘This campaign isn’t ours but every £ helps.’

In the 24 hours after it posted that 
photo, 800,000 donations were made and £1million raised. Some men have 
also followed suit with their own versions, posting pictures of their 
faces in make-up.

However, 
some Twitter and Facebook users have reacted angrily to the trend, with 
one user writing: ‘Because not wearing make-up is like....having cancer?
 I hope I’m missing the point here.’

Carolan
 Davidge, Cancer Research UK's director of communications, said: ‘We're 
really grateful to everyone who donated to Cancer Research UK through 
the #nomakeupselfie campaign.

‘We've
 agreed with Unicef that the donations they received will be given to 
Cancer Research UK. People who made a donation in error to Unicef have 
already been contacted to let them know the money is being transferred.’

US
 superstars Beyonce and Rihanna, British model Cara Delevingne and X 
Factor judge Cheryl Cole are also among those to take part in the craze.

World Wildlife Fund spokesman

Cancer Research UK said the donations will allow the charity to carry out 10 clinical trials which it did not have money to fully fund last week.

Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘We've been overwhelmed by the support people have been showing us through the #nomakeupselfie trend.

‘We don't receive any government funding for our research and so it's phenomenal to think that the generosity of the public is enabling us to fund critical research that we didn't have the money for six days ago.

‘Being able to fund more trials will bring forward the day when all cancers are cured. It's been an exciting week, and we'd just like to thank everyone again for their support.’

Cancer Research UK wants people to text BEAT to 70099 to donate £3 or visit www.cruk.org.
