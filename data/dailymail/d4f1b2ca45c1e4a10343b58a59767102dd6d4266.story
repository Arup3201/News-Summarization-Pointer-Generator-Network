Rafael Nadal's coach has criticised the appointment of Gala Leon Garcia as the captain of Spain's Davis Cup team. 

The Spanish Tennis Federation (RFET) handed 40-year-old Leon Garcia responsibility for the country's Davis Cup team following Carlos Moya's decision to step aside last week.

Leon Garcia, the former world number 27, becomes Spain's first female Davis Cup captain and just the fifth in the competition's history.

Toni Nadal, Rafael's coach and uncle, tells Onda Cero radio 'it is preferable that (the Davis Cup captain) is someone with a background in the world of men's tennis.'

He says 'the men's game isn't the same as the women's game, on the tactical level.' 

Toni Nadal believes Leon's appointment could create problems 'at dressing room level'.

'I have had zero relations with Gala Leon and I believe Rafa Nadal also zero, he has never mentioned it to me,' he said.

'But it doesn't matter, I have never spoken to her but that doesn't mean anything.

'It would seem to be more normal if the captain had been someone like Juan Carlos Ferrero, or some ex-player of a certain level, which is what has happened recently.'

Former world number one Ferrero, who retired in 2012, has expressed a desire to captain the team one day.

Moya quit after five-times winners Spain, fielding a weakened team, were relegated from the elite World Group for the first time in 18 years after a playoff loss in Brazil.

The RFET said in a statement on Monday that Leon Garcia, who quit the tour in 2004, would take on Moya's responsibilities as part of her role in charge of the federation's sporting management.

While Toni Nadal sounded unenthusiastic, Leon Garcia received support from Britain's two-time grand slam champion Andy Murray who broke the mould earlier this year by deciding to employ former French player Amelie Mauresmo as his coach.

'Congrats to Gala Leon Garcia for becoming first female Spanish Davis Cup captain today... hopefully first of many,' said the Scot on Twitter.

Moya stood down after less than a year in charge when Spain dropped out of the World Group, citing the unavailability of several top players as one of the factors in his decision.

Nadal did not play in Brazil because of a wrist injury that has sidelined him since Wimbledon. Spain's number two David Ferrer was also absent.

The RFET said full details of Leon Garcia's appointment would be disclosed on Tuesday in Seville.
