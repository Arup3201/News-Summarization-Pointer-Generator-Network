People in the New Forest woke to stunning scenes this morning as the sun illuminated thousands of spiders web and mist bathed the landscape in an eerie fog.

As dawn broke over the Hampshire national park, the dew-laden webs, carefully weaved overnight by thousands of spiders, hung delicately across the prickly gorse.

It comes as Britain woke to a chilly morning today with temperatures getting down to as low as -4.9 degrees at Tulloch Bridge in Invernessshire.

In contrast, parts of Cornwall were warmer with families waking to cloudy skies and temperatures of around 14 degrees.

Helen Chivers, a spokesman for the 
Met Office, said: 'The cold weather in the north is down to clear skies 
over much of the country last night.

'Temperatures drop really quickly on clear nights, especially as the nights are getting longer.'

Much of northern England and Scotland
saw temperatures drop below zero overnight, although the 
Midlands and the South were warmer due to the heavier cloud cover.

In the New Forest, temperatures were around 11 degrees and will remain that way over the next couple of days. 

Over the next 24 hours much of the 
South and South West will be cloudy with outbreaks of rain. The rest of 
the UK will be dry with sunny spells.

Outlook: The weather will get steadily worse as the week progresses with rain expected across much of the UK on Thursday. Today and tomorrow will be sunny in some places but largely cloudy

Ms Chivers said the weather will 
continue to be unsettled across Thursday and into the weekend, for most 
parts of the UK as autumn takes hold. 

Meanwhile, incredible pictures of majestic bellowing stags have been captured at the start of the rutting season.

The red deer were snapped on an autumn morning in the undergrowth at Bushy Park in London.

At this time of year the biggest and 
strongest males round up a group of females for mating and drive away 
rivals by bellowing and fighting them off.

The stags with their bracken crowns 
were spotted by amateur photographer Richard Bond, 53, who spent four 
hours snapping them in the Royal park.

'It was amazing to see the stags 
preparing for the rutting,' he added. 'The full rut hasn’t quite started
but I think it will be quite soon now.'

Mr Bond, from Farnborough, Hampshire,
who works in the medical industry, also captured a photo of a female 
deer with a jackdaw perched on her shoulder.

The birds often settle on red deer and pick out mites and ticks to keep them clean.

In return the birds use fur from the moulting deer in the spring time to line their nests.

He added: 'It’s a really lovely part of nature and they seem to have a real acceptance of each other.'
