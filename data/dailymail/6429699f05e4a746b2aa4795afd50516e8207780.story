The family of a Rhode Island seventh-grader who was suspended for three days for having a small toy gun keychain at school are appealing the suspension.

The family of 12-year-old Joseph Lyssikatos is asking the superintendent in the town of Coventry to reconsider the penalty.

Joseph was suspended last month after bringing a 2-inch keychain he won at an arcade to Alan Shawn Feinstein Middle School. The school has a zero tolerance policy for guns and replicas

Joseph Lyssikatos: The seventh grader is hoping his school record will be expunged in order to maintain 100% attendance for this year

Suspended: A seventh-grader from Rhode Island was suspended after bringing this gun-shaped key chain to school

Another student found the toy after it fell out of Joseph's backpack and began showing it off to classmates. Joseph was immediately suspended.

Although he has already served the suspension, his parents hope to get the black mark expunged from his record so Joseph can try for a perfect attendance this year.

The boy's stepmother Bonnie Bonanno wasn't happy: 'I think it’s extremely excessive,' she said.

'He’s a 12-year-old child, being a 12-year-old child. He’s a boy! It was not meant to cause any problems. It was a keychain that he had in his backpack and it fell out of his backpack on accident.'

'I think it’s way to excessive,' she continued. 'Especially for being a one-and-a-half inch keychain.'

Reconsider: The family plans to appeal a suspension given to the 12-year-old boy and hope the incident will be expunged from his record so he can keep his perfect attendance streak intact

Their meeting with the superintendent will take place this lunchtime.

'I told him last year that perfect attendance and non-lateness is a great character trait,' Keith Bonanno, Joseph's father said.

'And everyone's looking for that and he was upset to not have that.''It means a lot because my perfect attendance will help me in the future for my job and for my colleges,' said Joseph.

Even if the family succeed in getting Joseph's record wiped clean, he has been told that he is banned from  attending a field trip to Salem with his classmates later this month.
