A 22-year-old waitress whose legs were severed by a train has also lost most of her fingers to frostbite - but managed a smile as she was reunited with her beloved dog in her hospital bed.

Sarah Stott  was walking across a set of tracks on her way home in Verdun near Montreal on December 8 when the train struck her.

She lost her entire right leg, her left leg was severed below the knee and suffered hypothermia - causing her to lose large parts of her fingers - as she lay helpless in the plummeting temperatures.

But her friends and family say she is in 'good spirits' despite the prospect of a painful rehabilitation for the rest of her life. 

After two weeks in hospital she was also bought steak, her favorite meal, and told those around her: 'This is a good day'.

Treatment: Sarah Stott, 22, shares a moment with her beloved dog following a two week stay in hospital. Her legs were severed by a train at the end of December and she has since lost most of her fingers to frostbite

Miss Stott uploaded a picture to her Facebook of her kissing her dog with an oven glove on her right hand.

On her bandaged left hand, you can see a number of fingers have been removed up to the knuckle.

Em Whyte, the organised of Miss Stott's GoFundMe page which has so far raised $50,000 towards her medical bills, wrote:  I saw Sarah this past weekend. She is in such good spirits and she looks and is acting like her beautiful self. 

'Unfortunately Sarah's hands didn't fully recover from the frostbite, portions of all of her fingers had to be amputated. 

'She has most of her index fingers and thumbs but all of her other fingers were removed around the first knuckle. 

'Fortunately we were able to let Sarah and her dog visit for a few minutes this weekend and they were both so happy. In the past week Sarah has been able to eat food without an intervenes for the first time in a month so we brought her a steak dinner (her favourite) she had lots of company, was enjoying herself and said: "this was a good day". 

'Although Sarah is such a strong person and putting on a brave face she is in a lot of pain, she has phantom pains in her feet and a lot to get use to. 

'If all goes as planned Sarah will be well enough to be moved to Ottawa at the end of February to start her rehabilitation near her family and friends. Once Sarah is moved is when she will really begin to incur financial expenses. 

Severe: The waitress was making her way across a set of tracks on her way to her home in Verdun near Montreal when a train struck her in December

Debiltating: She lost her entire right leg, her left leg was severed below the knee and she also risks losing her fingertips after suffering hypothermia as she lay helpless in the plummeting temperatures

Horrifying: Her mother said Miss Stott saw her severed legs laying on the tracks next to her so she tried to crawl towards them. She lay in the freezing cold for three hours before she was taken to hospital 

'To mention a few costs, Sarah will need: a wheelchair, prosthetic legs and fingers. Alterations to everyday things will also be necessary. Although some costs will be covered it seems to be the bare minimum and Sarah's dreams are not minimal. 

'Please help her reach them! Help us reach this goal for Sarah!! No donation is to small, every dollar counts. Thank you to everyone who has donated, offered services, advise, console and concern.  

Miss Stott had planned to visit a friend following her shift at the Irish Embassy Pub and Grill in downtown Montreal on Monday December 8.

She got a taxi to her house but when she realized no one was at home, she left on foot and headed home.

As a short cut, she made her way over the CN Rail Tracks near Victoria Bridge, an area which has become popular with people crossing despite being unauthorized.

Miss Stott noticed there was a stopped train on one side of the tracks, however she did not spot the second coming the other way. It's not known how fast the train was travelling at the time.  

Her mother told CBC that Miss Stott could see her severed legs beside her on the tracks, so tried to crawl towards them.

She then lay on the ground in the cold for three hours before she saw another train approaching, waved it down and got them to help.

Positive: Despite the double amputation, her friends and family however say she is in good spirits and a crowd-funding campaign has so far raised more than $50,000 towards her medical bills

Miss Stott was then admitted to Montreal hospital trauma unit and has undergone 15 surgeries since her arrival. 

Her mother Shelley said: 'It’s a miracle that she’s alive. Every day with her is an absolute blessing. She has an extremely strong spirit and will to live. She was left there for three, four hours with her legs severed, in the cold. She was still conscious. She was hypothermic.'

Despite the severity of her injuries her mother added that she still had a sense of humor.

Mrs Stott added: 'I walked into the room one day and she was awake, and she lifted her leg and said, "Look Mom, I have no legs!" And I said, "Yes sweetheart, you’re going to get a brand new one.'" 

'She said, 'Yes I am! It’ll be firm forever — and I want it tanned,'"

Her mother now plans to take her back to the family home in Ottawa so she can care for her. 

With a long road ahead of her, a GoFundMe page has been set up and has already attracted hundreds of anonymous bids. 

'It’s very overwhelming,' Mrs Stott added. 'I always believed people have a good heart, but for the amount that was raised in such little time. 

'I’m speechless. I’m overwhelmed. I’m full of gratitude.'
