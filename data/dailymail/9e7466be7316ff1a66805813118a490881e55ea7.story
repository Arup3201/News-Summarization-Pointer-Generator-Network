A 43-year-old woman walking across a Boston drawbridge was crushed to death on New Years Eve

Aura Garcia, 43, has been idenitfied as the woman killed in a shocking accident on an East Boston bridge on Tuesday

after an operator raising the bridge for a boat to pass heard her screams and lowered it, accidentally trapping her between the two plates, investigators said.

Aura Garcia - known to friends as 'Laura' - was crossing the bridge around noon on Tuesday when a bridge operator, not aware that the woman was on the bridge, began raising it for the boat in the Chelsea River.

Garcia grabbed hold of one of the sides of the bridge and the operator immediately lowered it when he heard her scream, but she became trapped in between the plates and suffered massive trauma, police said.

'I couldn't see her, but I could hear her,' witness Waldina Garcia, who was not related to the victim, told the Boston Globe.

'She was screaming and screaming and screaming.'

Garcia - who has a three-year-old and a 15-year-old - was pronounced dead at the scene.

The woman was walking across the East Boston bridge about noon on Tuesday when the booth operator did not see her and opened the bridge for a boat to pass. When he heard her screams he started closing the bridge, which inadvertently crushed her

Emergency crews investigate the fatality on the Meridian Street Bridge, which spans East Boston and Chelsea, at about 12:21 p.m. Tuesday

Waldina said she was preparing to walk across the bridge when lights started flashing and a loud foghorn went off indicating that the bridge was opening.

It's not known if the victim started crossing the bridge after the warning alarms sounded.

Waldina said she saw a grey hat fall from the top of the bridge and that the woman's screams lasted about a minute.

Investigators called her death on the Meridian Street Bridge, which connects Chelsea and East Boston, a 'horrible accident'.

The distraught bridge operator was taken to the hospital for evaluation, officials said.

The Meridian St Bridge regularly opens for boats to pass through, however the victim was in the bridge operator's 'blind spot'

A woman walking across a Boston drawbridge was crushed to death Tuesday after an operator raising the bridge for a boat to pass heard her screams and lowered it, accidentally trapping her between the two plates, investigators said.

The pedestrian's body was removed from the plates about 4.30pm.

Dot Joyce, a spokeswoman for Mayor Thomas Menino, told the Globe that the bridge operator was placed on unpaid leave pending results of the investigation.

She described that as standard procedure.

Investigators said it wasn't clear whether the woman began crossing the bridge after warning lights and alarms were activated, the Globe reported.

The bridge was closed to traffic during the investigation, but later reopened.

The Meridian St Bridge was closed for the afternoon as investigators looked into the incident. The victim waqs identified late on Tuesday as 43-year-old mother Aura Garcia
