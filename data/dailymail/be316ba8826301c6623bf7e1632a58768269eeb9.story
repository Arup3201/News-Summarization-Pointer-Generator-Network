A fire erupted through Disney World's new Seven Dwarfs Mine Train ride last night.

The 20-seat shuttle was set alight at around 10.20pm ET when embers from the evening fireworks display landed on an adjacent building.

Emergency services spent 40 minutes battling the blaze after passengers were escorted off.

For many, the emergency was a source of amusement.

One wrote: 'Come to Walt Disney World. Trust me, the fire effects on the rides are so realistic, you'd swear the ride is burning.'
