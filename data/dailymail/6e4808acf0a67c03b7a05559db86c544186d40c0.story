Rupert Murdoch is determined to add Time Warner Cable to his media empire.

The cable company recently rejected his initial $80billion bid from 21st Century Fox, but apparently Murdoch is ready to up the ante above $85 a share, sources told Bloomberg News.

If accepted, the takeover would be the biggest media deal in more than a decade.

Not over yet: Rupert Murdoch's $80billion bid to take over cable company Time Warner Cable was rejected, but sources say he will bid again. Pictured above on Wednesday, speaking at the B20 conference in Sydney

The move could create a mega-sized 
media conglomerate that owns rights to dozens of popular TV shows and 
thousands of films, as well as cable TV networks and local broadcast TV 
channels.

Such a company
 would be a content provider powerful enough to aggressively negotiate 
with cable companies and internet service providers.

It's estimated that Fox would save nearly $1billion annually by eliminating overlapping staff.

Murdoch also criticised 'subservient politicians stifling economic growth' as he spoke at a meeting of the Business 20 leaders in Sydney

Details of the Time Warner Cable bid were released this week just one day before Murdoch appeared at a B20 conference in Sydney, Australia and criticized the excessive financial red tape in free market economies.

If Murdoch proceeds with the Time Warner Cable takeover, it would be heavily scrutinized by antitrust regulators. Fox would likely have to sell CNN to appease the regulators since the company already has it's own 24-hour news network.

He says that the G20 governments need to 'take a back seat' and allow businesses to drive economic growth.

He said U.S. President Barack Obama was penalising businesses by cracking down on so-called 'profit shifting' by major corporations to countries with lighter tax regimes, a technique that is also in the sights of the G20.

'My blood pressure goes up when I think of the number of local, state and federal regulations we have in our lives today,' the 83-year-old Australian billionaire told the meeting.

'That is just in America. Don't even get me started on the European Union.'

Murdoch, who did not refer to the Time Warner 
bid during the meeting, has his eye on the media conglomerate, which owns CNN, HBO, Warner Brothers, among other big-name media properties. Experts say he isn't likely to give up after one rejection.

Sources told Bloomberg that Murdoch hasn't been directly involved in the discussions.

The B20 was set up in 2010 to give policy recommendations on behalf of the international business community to the G20.

Murdoch was speaking at the meeting a day after it was revealed his Twenty-First Century Fox Inc made an $80 billion offer for Time Warner Inc, which was rejected

Business leaders meeting here are looking to influence the outcome of the G20 Leaders Summit in Brisbane in November.

Murdoch
 told the meeting: 'I believe that business does have a role in shaping 
public policy, mainly in helping limit the size and scope of government.

'For
 businesses large and small, there's simply too much red tape, too many 
subservient politicians stifling economic growth and entrepreneurism.'

The G20 is targeting growth of two per cent above trend over the next five years.

It
 is also tackling corporate 'profit shifting', which has allowed 
multinationals such as Starbucks Corp, Google Inc, Apple Inc and 
Amazon.com Inc to avoid paying taxes.

G20 finance ministers in February endorsed a set of common standards for sharing bank account information across borders, with automatic exchange of information among G20 members to take effect by the end of 2015.

Obama, meanwhile, earlier this year proposed tightening restrictions on U.S. multinationals that shift their tax domiciles abroad in his 2015 budget.

Obama wants to raise the minimum level of foreign ownership in a newly inverted holding company to 50 per cent from about 20 per cent, making the deals more difficult to carry out.

'Do we really expect overseas companies to voluntarily bring profits back to be taxed at 35 to 40 percent in the United States, when the corporate tax rate in Ireland is 12.5 per cent?' Murdoch said.

'This is not the way to achieve economic growth.'
