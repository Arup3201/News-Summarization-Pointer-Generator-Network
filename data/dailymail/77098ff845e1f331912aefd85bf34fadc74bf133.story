A University football society has been accused of racism after more than 30 members 'blacked up' for an Africa Cup of Nations themed party.

The male players from Stirling University FC were spotted wearing kilts, football kit and black face paint for a social in the Scottish town last night.

An investigation has been launched after complaints were made about the 'boisterous' behaviour of the 'drunk' students as many were seen taking their tops off near popular bar The Crossed Peels.

Jim MacIvor said: 'I saw 30 to 40 blacked up footballers having a drink. They were just socialising, normal stuff.

Stirling University FC has been accused of racism after more than 30 members 'blacked up' for an Africa Cup of Nations themed party

'They were being quite boisterous- they were quite drunk – and some of them were taking their tops off and stuff like that.'

'I happened to be in the flat across the road from Cape and I saw them leave around half 11, quarter to 12.'

An anti-racism campaigner from Show Racism the Red Card said: 'The practice of blacking up was usually as part of a show by white entertainers for white audiences which relied on mocking black people's skin colour and culture.

'The practice is racist and should definitely be avoided in our more enlightened times.'

Second year History student, Conor Fitzpatrick, said: 'They are not only embarrassing us, the student body, in front of our peers and the local community but also on a national level.'

But some students insisted that the football club was not guilty of racism.

Student Daniel Shields, who was not part of the social, said: 'To insinuate that the football club, one of the most inclusive sports clubs at the university is racist in any way is a farce and a lie.

'I assume every time anyone dresses up as a non-white individual at Halloween, socials etc there will be similar articles.

'Will that include the Hulk, Smurfs and characters for the Simpsons too?'

Second year footballer Joe Mullen said: 'I've nothing to say on the matter. Everything is getting blown out of proportion.

'I've nothing else to say, sorry.'

A spokesperson said: 'The University of Stirling has been made aware of incidents involving a number of students on the night of Thursday 5 February and an investigation has been launched with immediate effect.

'The University and the Students' Union are committed to promoting equality and diversity, through a range of policies, procedures and initiatives, and believe all staff, students and members of wider society should be treated with dignity and respect.

'The University treats issues relating to racism with the utmost seriousness and will respond robustly to any behaviours that do not meet with our values and expectations.'
