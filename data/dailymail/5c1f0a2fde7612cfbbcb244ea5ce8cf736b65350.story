Fears are growing that the deadly Ebola virus has hit a new continent as a missionary in Brazil undergoes tests for the infection.

If the Brazilian case is confirmed, it would mean the disease has spread to South America for the first time. 

The suspected patient is a 47-year-old man from Guinea, one of the African countries that has been ravaged by the disease.

An ambulance moves the first suspected Ebola patient in Brazil to an airport so he can travel to Rio de Janeiro for further treatment 

He has been described in local media as a missionary and he was taken in an airforce plane from the southern state of Parana to the National Infectious Disease Institute in Rio de Janeiro on Friday morning. 

It came after he arrived at a health centre in the town of Cascavel with a fever the previous afternoon. 

The health ministry said today that the patient was 'in good shape' and his slight fever had now subsided. 

Minister Arthur Chioro noted that the patient had been in Brazil for the maximum incubation period for the Ebola virus of 21 days. 

The result of a test for the virus should be available by early Saturday, he said.

'We could not rule out (Ebola), even though it had been 20 days, given the fever and the patient's origin,' Mr Chioro told journalists in Brasilia. 

The man, who has not been named, is thought to have arrived in Brazil from Africa on September 19 from the Guinean capital Conakry after flying to Argentina, with a layover in Morocco, then travelled overland to Brazil, seeking refugee status. 

The patients who were in the clinic with have also been isolated and the site disinfected, said radio network CBN.

It is thought he is suffering from symptoms similar to those of Ebola and is being moved to Rio de Janeiro for treatment.

It is not yet confirmed if he has Ebola.

Meanwhile French medics have established that an unnamed woman in Paris has tested negative for Ebola.

It comes as the British government ordered airports and Eurostar terminals to quiz passengers arriving from West Africa in an attempt to prevent Ebola entering the UK.

But experts have told MailOnline 'shutting borders will not stop Ebola', as leading experts say the key to tackling the vicious virus is 'rooting it out' at the source, in West Africa.

The woman had been undergoing tests at the Bichat Hospital and had been placed in a sterilised isolation room.

But France’s health minister Marisol Touraine today said that tests on a suspected Ebola sufferer had proved negative.

The unnamed female American patient had been travelling in Africa, said Ms Touraine, but she was not suffering from the fatal disease.

'There have been no cases of Ebola in France, and this remains the case,' added Ms Touraine. 

The new suspected cases come after authorities in Taiwan also tested a Nigerian woman for Ebola after she was showing symptoms of the fatal virus after arriving at an airport in the country.

However, it was revealed earlier today that she tested negative Ebola and reportedly had a history of malaria.

The condition of Spanish nurse, Teresa Romero, the first to have contracted Ebola outside Africa has remained stable 

Meanwhile, the condition of a Spanish nurse with Ebola today remained stable as she lay gravely ill in a Madrid hospital.

Teresa Romero, 44, is the first person to have contracted Ebola outside of Africa, after becoming infected by a Spanish priest repatriated from Africa with the disease as she treated him at the Carlos III Hospital.

Yesterday seven people turned themselves in to an Ebola isolation unit in Madrid, where Mrs Romero is being cared for.

The seven new admissions included two hairdressers who had given her a beauty treatment before she was diagnosed with Ebola, and hospital staff who had treated the 44-year-old nurse

A hospital spokeswoman said there were now 14 people in the isolation unit on its sealed-off sixth floor, including Romero, her husband, and health workers who had cared for Romero since she was admitted on Monday.

Spanish labour unions accused the government of seeking to deflect the blame onto Mrs Romero for the failings of its health system, after the European Union asked Spain to explain how the virus could have been spread on a high-security ward.

The top regional health official in Madrid, Javier Rodriguez, has said Mrs Romero took too long to admit she had made a mistake by touching her face with the glove of her protective suit while taking it off.

In a radio interview he said: 'She has taken days to recognise that she may have made a mistake when taking off the suit. If she had said it earlier, it would have saved a lot of work.

But the nurse's brother Jose Ramon told the newspaper El Pais: 'They will find any way to blame her. Basically, my sister did her job ... and she has become infected with Ebola.'

The Ebola virus causes fever, vomiting and diarrhoea and sometimes internal bleeding, and is spread through direct contact with body fluids. About half of those infected in West Africa have died.

The World Health Organisation say around 3,600 people have died from the infection during the current outbreak. 

But experts have warned that shutting borders will not stop Ebola from spreading.  

Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, told MailOnline: 'Shutting borders will not stop Ebola, you have to root it out.' 

He added: 'The longer this goes on the more likely it is we may see a case in the UK.

'But the UK deals with things like this  effectively, they (the authorities) handle it.

'They are ready enough and have the capacity. There are a lot of doctors and nurses here who have been out there (to West Africa) with Doctors Without Borders, and so who have Ebola experience, which is invaluable.'

It comes just hours after Michael Fallon  appealed for calm over threat of virus reaching the UK. Pictured are Liberian Red Cross burial volunteers praying before collecting the body of an Ebola victim

Meanwhile Professor Robert Dingwall, a specialist in health policy responses to infectious diseases at Nottingham Trent University accused the US of 'gesture politics', by introducing temperature screening at five airports.

He told MailOnline: 'Controls are costly to enforce, inconvenience people and disrupt economic activity while having little or no impact on the spread of infections.'

Experts say the most effective method of tackling the outbreak is to direct resources and funds to fighting the disease in West Africa, welcoming news the UK has vowed to deploy 750 soldiers and a medical warship to Sierra Leone. 

With Ebola cases already seen in Spain and the US, ministers have admitted it is 'entirely possible' the deadly virus will enter the UK 'by one route or another'. 

Airport screening of people leaving airports in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea has been in place for several weeks.

Health experts have pleaded that anyone with symptoms do not visit their GP or A&E for fear of spreading the disease 

Official figures from the US Centre for Disease Control found in the last two months since exit screening began in three countries, 77 people from 36,000 screened were denied boarding a flight over health concerns.

None of the 77 passengers were diagnosed with Ebola, though many were diagnosed as having malaria.  

Professor Dingwall said screening is ineffective because 'many diseases have a fairly lengthy incubation period and the infection cannot be passed on until the symptoms appear'.

He told MailOnline: 'In this case, Ebola has an incubation period of up to 21 days.
