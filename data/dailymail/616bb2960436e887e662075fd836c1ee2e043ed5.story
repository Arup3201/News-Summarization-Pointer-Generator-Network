A 23-year-old driver was caught by police doing a burn out at traffic lights on a busy intersection in Perth, Western Australia

The incident was captured on a camera attached to the police's motorbike. 

The video shows a busy intersection at sunset, with two cars stopped at a red light in front of the metallic-blue ute.

The unlucky driver must have had no idea that two motorcycle officers were stopped on the opposite side of the intersection before deciding to perform a smoky burn-out. 

The officer signalled their sirens as it drove against traffic and stopped in front of the 23-year-old's smoky car.  

It only got worse for the driver, who allegedly had a blood alcohol reading of 0.8 - more than double the legal limit.

Western Australia Police said that it is usually a very busy road so if the drunk driver had lost control 'the potential for catastrophe was high'

Western Australia Police said that it is usually a very busy road so if the drunk driver had lost control 'the potential for catastrophe was high'. 

The vehicle was impounded and the driver was charged with reckless and drunk driving.

Western Australia Police uploaded the 30 second video to their Facebook page on Thursday. It has already received over 4,000 likes and more than 1,000 people have shared the post.

Facebook users have posted controversial comments under the video, shaming the drunk driver who could have caused a potential accident. 

'As a car enthusiast I'm embarrassed, we're not all like this, personally I hope his car gets crushed. He has no respect for anyone around him', Chris White wrote. 

'Why people still do this at an intersection gets me. I was brought up to take it so far away that one, it won't disturb the peace and two, that it doesn't endanger lives if you do lose control,' Ben Wheeler wrote. 

The Holden Commodore was behind two vehicles stopped at a red light and was reportedly more than two times over the legal alcohol limit 

The police officer captured the incident on their motorcycle camera
