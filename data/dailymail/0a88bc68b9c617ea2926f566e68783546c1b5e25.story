Carlisle United have sacked manager Graham Kavanagh after a poor start to the  season.

The former Republic of Ireland midfielder took over from Greg Abbott last September but was unable to prevent their relegation to League Two last year.

And after Saturday's 5-0 defeat to Cambridge saw Carlisle move third bottom with just two points, Kavanagh was axed  following talks with the club's directors on Sunday night.

Axed: Kavanagh oversaw three defeats and two draws as Carlisle got off to a poor start in League Two

A club statement read: ‘Unfortunately results on the field have not reflected that effort and hard work and from the 40 league games last season, following Greg Abbott’s departure, and through the five league games this season there has been an average of one point per game.

‘This resulted in relegation to League 2 in May 2014 and it was felt we were continuing to head in the same direction this season. Saturday’s result at Cambridge was a “tipping point” for those concerned with the running and management of Carlisle United Football Club.’

Club captain Paul Thirlwell and goalkeeping coach Tony Caig have been placed in temporary charge.
