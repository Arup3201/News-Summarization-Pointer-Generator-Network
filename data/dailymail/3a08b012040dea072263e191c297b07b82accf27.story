BUSTED: Briana Buchana, 27, remains in jail on accusations that she had a meth lab in her and cooked the drug in front of 7-year-old son

A Florida mother has been arrested after her 7-year-old son told her landlord she was cooking meth in the trunk of her car — and the boy even walked authorities through her recipe.

For days, the boy told his landlord in the Orlando suburb of Edgewood that he wanted to show him 'mommy's bad stuff,' according to police reports.

The 7-year-old said his mother, Briana Buchanan, 27, was cooking 'something bad.'

On Friday, he once again said 'there's really bad stuff in my mom's car' — and this time he picked up the keys and took the landlord to see it.

'He opened up the car and he pointed to a bag and right away its everything you've seen online related to meth labs,' the man, Peter Arnold, told WESH-TV.

Arnold, who considers the boy a nephew, called 911.

The 7-year-old told police that, to make the 'bad stuff,' his mother 'goes to the store and lies to people that she is sick and needs medicine,' according to her arrest report.

'She then mixes the stuff she buys in a Gatorade bottle and she shakes it,' the boy told police, according to WESH-TV.

On Facebook, Buchanan seems every bit the doting
 mother, posting picture and picture with her 7-year-old son. But police
 say that she often cooked methamphetamine in front of the boy, who 
eventually called cops on her

Police also found syringes filled with meth inside the woman's home, the station reported.

When confronted by officers, Buchanan admitted that she knew how to cook meth and had done it while her son was in the car, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal.

Buchanan is facing accusations of child neglect with great bodily harm and a slew of charges relating to possessing and manufacturing methamphetamine.

She remains at the Volusia County Branch Jail, unable to post $32,000 bail, the News-Journal reported.

The boy, whose name was not released, is now with his grandmother.

'I can already tell you, just looking at his face, he is relieved to be out of the situation,' Arnold told  News 13.

Buchanan's charges may yet be upgraded to trafficking, which carries a stiffer sentence, the station reported.
