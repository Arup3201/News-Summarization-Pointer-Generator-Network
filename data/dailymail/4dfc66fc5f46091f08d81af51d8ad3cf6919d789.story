An investigative journalism site has ripped apart reports the Malaysian Boeing MH17 was shot down by a Ukranian war plane, claiming to have exposed the images as possibly photoshop fakes.

A report by Russian state television claimed to have discovered a 'sensational' satellite photo of the last seconds of the doomed flight over Ukraine.

The release of 'leaked' satellite images show a missile hurtling towards the passenger plane, while it was also claimed that the space pictures were from a British or US satellite.

But following the release of these images, Bellingcat said suspicions were immediately raised by a number of online aviation experts, debating the inconsistencies, which lead to claims they were indeed 'fakes'.

Russian Channel 1 has released satellite images which suggest Malaysian Boeing MH17 (top of picture) was shot down by a Ukrainian warplane (bottom left)

Aviation experts claims the images are actually fakes pointing out there is several issues including the type of aircraft (pictured) which conclude it is not a Boeing 777 

Suspicions arose on Twitter that the images were not real including comparisons to the fighter jet (pictured) which was claimed to have shot down MH17 

Bellingcat says it is clear that the satellite map imagery was created from a composite of different satellite map imagery

The news couldn't come at a worse time for Russian President Vladimir Putin who has already faced a rather cold reception by other world leaders at the G20 summit in Brisbane after Western leaders piled pressure on Mr Putin for the crisis in Ukraine and threatened more sanctions.

The flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was travelling over the conflict-hit region when it disappeared from radar.

A total of 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members were killed.

Russian TV presenter Mikhail Leontiev claimed that the mysterious source who provided the images concluded they showed 'how a Mig-29 fighter plane destroys the Boeing passenger plane'.

Bellingcat said suspicions were immediately raised by a number of online aviation experts, debating the inconsistencies, which lead to claims the images, showing MH17 being shot down by a fighter jet, fake

But the citizen journalists site made claims that the images which were posted on a Russian message board on October 15th, claimed to originate from WikiLeaks, but that this contradicted their origin.

Bellingcat said it was clear that the satellite map imagery was created from a composite of different satellite map imagery and that the fighter jet shown is reminiscent of an Su-27, not Su-25 as reported by Russian TV.

There has also been questions over the plane's Malaysian airlines logo, with aviation experts concluding it's in the wrong place while the 'MH17' plane appears to be a Boeing 767 rather than a 777.

The Bellingcat site said after all the evidence was presented, it was clear the images weren't credible, concluding Malaysian flight MH17 was not shot down by another aircraft. 

The West has repeatedly suggested the plane was shot down by pro-Moscow rebels using a Russian-made BUK missile system.

The claims that the images were a fake obviously angered some who believed they were real

Russia has argued an unidentified plane was in vicinity at the time of the crash, and that Ukraine and the West have hushed up this fact.

The Kremlin-owned channel's presenter said: 'Today we have all grounds to suppose that a State crime was committed by those who deliberately destroyed the plane. And by those who are cynically hiding it, having the full information.'

The extraordinary broadcast came ahead of Western leaders including David Cameron confronting Vladimir Putin over the crash at a summit in Australia.

Channel One claimed: 'We have at our disposal a sensational shot, supposedly made by foreign satellite spy during the final seconds of MH17 above Ukraine.'

Ivan Adrievskiy, vice president of Russian Engineers Union, suggested the image was taken by an American or British satellite

An 'expert' called George Bilt was cited as saying the Boeing was shot out of the sky in 'a classic fighter jet attack from the rear'

The reported disputed a BUK missile as the cause of the tragedy.

'To cut it short, it looks like there was no BUK and no launch from the ground. There were dozens professional and thousands of amateur witnesses, and no-one registered it,' claimed Leontiev.

Ivan Adrievskiy, vice president of Russian Engineers Union, said: 'We see a photograph taken from space from a low orbit. Usually such images are taken for the sake of general reconnaissance of the air and the ground.

'The coordinates of the photograph mean we can suppose that the image was taken by an American or British satellite.

'We have studied this picture in detail and did not find any sign proving it to be fake.'

Vladimir Putin  accused the Ukrainians of 'constantly shelling' the MH17 crash site earlier this week amid steeply rising concern in the West that he has ordered massive military reinforcements to bolster pro-Moscow rebel forces.

At least 21 trucks, six tanks and 14 howitzer cannons were seen driving through rebel-territory to Donetsk, while residents reported a convoy of 12 unmarked military trucks.

Ukraine alleges that recent days have seen a huge increase in military hardware, professional soldiers and AK-74 assault rifles fitted with laser pointers moving towards Donetsk from Russia.
