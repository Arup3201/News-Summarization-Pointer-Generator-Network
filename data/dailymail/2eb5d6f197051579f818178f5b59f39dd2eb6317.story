Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger insists he has no regrets over not re-signing Cesc Fabregas despite the Spanish midfielder's dazzling performance for Chelsea at Burnley.

The former Arsenal midfielder moved to Stamford Bridge from Barcelona in the summer and caught the eye in helping Jose Mourinho's side win 3-1 at Turf Moor.

But Wenger insists he does not regret the decision not to bring Fabregas back to Arsenal.

He said: 'I have no regrets that Fabregas [joined Chelsea]. My only regret is that he left us in the first place.

'It was strange to see Cesc in a Chelsea shirt. We have to accept that players move. It was difficult for me to see him leave but we accept he moved.'

On song: Cesc Fabregas impressed on his Premier League return for Chelsea at Burnley

Fabregas spent eight years at Arsenal before leaving to return home and rejoin Barcelona in 2011.

After
 a three-year stint at the Nou Camp, the Spanish midfielder returned to 
London this summer, but to Arsenal's rivals Chelsea in a £30m deal.

Wenger
 hasn't ruled out further activity in the transfer window, though, to 
add to the signings of Alexis Sanchez, Calum Chambers, Mathieu Debuchy 
and David Ospina.

The
 Arsenal manager said: 'We are not in an emergency case but we are open 
to any opportunity to strengthen our defensive department.'

Sidelined: Mikel Arteta is out of the game against Everton after picking up an injury against Besiktas

Open to business: Wenger confirmed that Arsenal are still looking to further strengthen their squad

Arsenal 
travel to Everton on Saturday in the Barclays Premier League after 
beginning their season with a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace.

The
 Gunners will be without the injured Mikel Arteta, who picked up a knock
 against Besiktas, while German trio Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski and
 Mesut Ozil could miss the game as they work their way back to match 
fitness after the World Cup.

Arsenal visited Everton in April and Wenger's side were brushed aside 3-0.

On the rise: Calum Chambers impressed for Arsenal against Besiktas in their Champions League qualifier

Wenger
 knows the size of the challenge his team face at Goodison Park this 
weekend, and he is confident that young defender Calum Chambers can 
continue his good form after impressing in Istanbul.

But
 the Arsenal manager also warned against rushing his development as a 
footballer, and thinks it may be a bit too soon for an England call up.

He said : 'It is a big test for Chambers but it was also a test against Demba Ba.

'In England you have to be a bit more patient. It's important for his development that he doesn't go too fast.

'I don't want to stop Chambers 
playing for England, but what I mean is when players feel like they have
 already made it that is more dangerous.'

ARSENE WENGER LIVE: Here's how the Arsenal manager's press conference unfolded

Host commentator

Just to recap the main talking points:

- Mikel Arteta out of Everton game

- No regrets on not re-signing Cesc Fabregas

- No confirmation yet on the return of German trio Lukas Podolski, Per Mertesacker and Mesut Ozil

- Arsenal 'open to any opportunity to strengthen' in transfer market

Arsenal fans would have seen their former midfielder Fabregas impress for Chelsea against Burnley. But Wenger insists he has no regrets on not re-signing the midfielder.

He said: 'I have no regrets that Fabregas [joined Chelsea]. My only regret is that he left us in the first place.

Wenger added: 'Aaron Ramsey has a different style to Fabregas but he has a huge potential.'

'[Man United] have the quality and Van Gaal will get the right balance. They will fight for the championship.'

'It is a big test [for Calum Chambers against Romelu Lukaku] but it was also a test against Demba Ba.'

Chambers looked very impressive in the first leg in Turkey the other night and faces another challenge against £28m man Lukaku.

Wenger: 'We have had no offers for anyone to leave.'

Joel Campbell and Lukas Podolski are among those linked with Arsenal exits.

Wenger: 'I will check [whether the Germans] are available for selection against Everton.'

He hasn't ruled out a return for Mertesacker, Ozil and Podolski.

Wenger: 'We are not in an emergency case but we are open to any opportunity to strengthen our defensive department.'

Last year, Everton thrashed Arsenal 3-0 at Goodison Park.

The Arsenal boss has just said: 'Everton deserved to win [when the teams last met]. We beat them in the FA Cup. They are flirting with Champions League.'

As Neil Ashton reported, Arteta is not fit to face his former side on Saturday. Arsene Wenger has just confirmed that.

Still waiting for Wenger, but Roberto Martinez is speaking to the media at the moment...

Still plenty of time for some business to be done before the transfer window slams shut (... or closes).

You may have read LAURIE WHITWELL's take on Olivier Giroud after the 0-0 draw with Besiktas. Do Arsenal need another striker?

I'm sure transfers will be one of Wenger's talking points when he speaks in a few minutes from now.

Arsenal have begun the season without their trio of World Cup winners Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski.

Arsene Wenger is among those who think that the Premier League season has started too soon after the World Cup and that it should have been more in line with the later starts seen in La Liga and Serie A.

Find out how close the three Germans are to a competitive return when Wenger speaks shortly.

NEIL ASHTON reported that the Spanish midfielder has been ruled out for the next two games.

The Arsenal captain was taken off in the 50th minute against Besiktas after a challenge from former Chelsea striker Demba Ba.

With Aaron Ramsey suspended as well, there will be a couple of changes in Arsenal's midfield for the crucial second leg at the Emirates next Wednesday. 

There's plenty on the agenda for the Arsenal boss this morning as he looks ahead to the trip to Everton at the weekend.

Arsenal began their season with a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace and then drew 0-0 with Besiktas in the first leg of their Champions League play-off in Istanbul.

Wenger saw Mikel Arteta hobble off injured in Turkey and is also still waiting for German trio Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski to return to competitive action after their World Cup exploits.

The Arsenal manager will be LIVE from 9am today so stay tuned.
