Catherine Zeta Jones has been turning heads for decades, but she has finally been crowned the most beautiful British woman alive.

The Welsh actress first graced our screens as Mariette in The Darling Buds of May when she was just 22.

Twenty years on, the 41-year-old has beaten younger celebrities Cheryl Cole, 28, and Kelly Brook, 31, to be named our prettiest compatriot.

Welsh actress Zeta Jones, now 41, was 
voted as most fitting the model of modern beauty - beating Cheryl Cole, 
28, and Kelly Brook, 31

Hollywood legend Audrey Hepburn was voted the most beautiful British woman of all time.

Elizabeth Taylor, another timeless Hollywood beauty, 
came second to the Breakfast At Tiffany's actress while Princess Diana's iconic looks completed the top 
three. 

Catherine Zeta Jones, in fourth spot, was the highest place 
living beauty followed by Cheryl Cole, Kelly Brook, Keira Knightley, 
Kate Beckinsale and Holly Willoughby who all held their 
own against old school glamour.

An analysis of the top 100 most 
beautiful British women of all time reveals that the  most beautiful stand at an average of 
5ft 5in, have blue eyes, dark brown hair, and are 
actresses by profession.

TV shopping channel QVC asked 2,000 men 
and women to vote on who they believed to be the most beautiful British 
women over the decades.

Blue-eyed Brits appear to have beaten 
brown-eyed girls to the top slots with just under half of the top
100 being blessed with blue eyes compared to only 39 brown-eyed girls.

With only 14 classic British beauties having green eyes, this was the 
rarest eye colour. 

Stepping over to the dark side is obviously the way 
forward with 53 brunettes dominating the top 100 versus only 43 blondes,
leaving Dr Who's Karen Gillan, model Lily Cole, singer Nicola Roberts 
and award winning actress Tilda Swinton flying the flag for redheads.

Actresses meanwhile seem to have the edge on any other profession in the
beauty stakes as 46 of the 100 are thespians by trade.
