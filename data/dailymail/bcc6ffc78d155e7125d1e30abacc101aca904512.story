A mother has spoken of her heartbreak after her son died in a car crash as he rushed to see his fatally injured sister - just months after he shot dead his mom's fiance in self defense.

The string of tragedies has devastated Rose Tucker, 43, who is now planning funerals for her children Ricky, 20, and Brenda, 21, six months after losing her fiance, James Hickey, 37.

'I cry all day,' she told the Detroit Free Press as she looked over family photographs in her Detroit, Michigan home. 'I don't know what to do, so I'm lost.'

She explained that the heartache began in April when she was fighting with Hickey, who had lived with the family for 18 years. After her son pulled her fiance off her, Hickey pulled a gun and shot him.

Ricky returned fire and hit the man he saw as his stepfather in the chest, killing him.

Although the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office ruled Ricky acted in lawful self-defense and did not press charges, he punished himself - and he and his sister took the death badly.

'They've both been messed up since that happened,' their mother told the Free Press.

She explained that they had both tried to take their lives, which had alienated some relatives.

Then early Sunday morning, she received a call from Ricky that her daughter had a gun at the Texas Bar & Grill on Kercheval, which is owned by the family.

'She grabbed a gun, and I took it away from her head,' her uncle, Eddie Falbo told the Detroit News

'Others
 were talking to her. I came out the door and heard, "pop". It was 
terrible. There were about eight to ten people in the bar; everyone 
heard it.'

Before Rose arrived, Ricky called again to tell his mother the news.

Her son Ricky was speeding to St.
 John Hospital to be by Brenda's bedside when
 his car veered out of its lane and collided with an oncoming Chevrolet 
Suburban.

The crash killed him and left the driver of the SUV with minor 
injuries, police said.

'He probably didnâ€™t know she had died 
and he was rushing to the hospital to see how she was doing,' police 
spokesman Kelly Miner said.

Family tragedy: He was rushing to see sister Brenda Tucker, 21, who had threatened suicide inside the Texas Bar - owned by her family - before pointing the gun at her chest and pulling the trigger

His mother also rushed to the hospital and was standing outside when she saw them bring in her son. He died on arrival at the hospital.

Now she says she plans to cremate her two children, who often argued, together - 'that way they can still argue with each other every day,' she said.

Relatives have set up a memorial page and are trying to raise money for funeral costs.
