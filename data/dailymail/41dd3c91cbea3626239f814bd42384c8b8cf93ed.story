He hasn't had the easiest year defending his economic record and actions on immigration. 

And a playful appearance on The Colbert Report brought no light relief for President Obama.

Amid jokes about his approval ratings and big ears, he could not escape a grilling about his move to protect five million immigrants from deportation without Congress approval. 

Host Stephen Colbert, who is known for scolding his interviewees, accused Obama of exceeding his authority with his executive order.

'When did you decide to burn the Constitution and become emperor?' he asked.

Playful appearance: President Obama told Stephen Colbert his family tease him about his big ears and suits

The question was heard as a joke by many in the audience at George Washington University. But to Obama's critics, the question had a ring of truth.

Obama dropped the comedy and replied: 'Actually, Steve, everything that we have done is scrupulously within the law and has been done by previous Democratic and Republican presidents.'

The tongue-in-cheek question came at the close of a playful interview, in which the President revealed his family make sure power doesn't go to his head.

His daughters mock his big ears and his stuffy suits, and he leaves his socks on the floor, he told Colbert.

In fact, he said, he feels much more important sitting behind the revered chat show host's desk.

'When I go home, Michelle, Malia and Sasha give me a hard time. There are no trumpets, and they tease me mercilessly.'

His comments came on the special DC edition of the show.

Colbert also addressed his delayed decision on the Keystone XL oil pipeline, chiding that it should run into Mexico and around the world.

Regular: It is Obama's third appearance on the show - his second since taking office in 2009

Moving on: The show, filmed in Washington, DC, was one of Colbert's last as he prepares to move to CBS

It was Obama's third appearance on the show, his second as president, and marked the beginning of the final two weeks for the Comedy Central show. 

Colbert will take over for David Letterman on CBS' 'Late Show' next year.

Obama kicked off the show sitting in for Colbert to perform a regular feature of the program called 'the Word' wherein Colbert's rants are accompanied by snarky messages to the audience.

So when Obama, as Colbert, declared that there are aspects of 'Obamacare' that people from both parties actually like, the text aside to the audience read: 'Everything but the Obama.'

Later, Colbert observed that the economy had been creating more jobs of late.

Debate: Colbert, who is known for scolding his interviewees, gave his views on the Keystone pipeline

'You have employed a lot of people - mostly as secretary of defense,' Colbert cracked in a reference to Obama recently nominating his fourth top civilian at the Pentagon.

'That's boosted our numbers a little bit,' Obama replied. 

As he wrapped up, Colbert had one last question: 'Barack Obama - great president or the greatest president?'

'I'm going to let someone else decide - not you, but someone who knows what they're talking about,' the president replied.

Colbert countered: 'Stephen Colbert - great pundit or the greatest pundit?'

Obama didn't miss a beat: 'The greatest pundit.'
