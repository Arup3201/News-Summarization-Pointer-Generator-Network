The National Rifle Association has been strangely quiet since the Sandy Hook shootings two days ago in Newtown, Connecticut.

There has been no response to the horrific shootings, no heartfelt note of sympathy to the families of the victims or any press release once again defending the right to bear arms.

On the day of the shooting, the web site published one item at 9:12am, minutes before Adam Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School and shot dead 20 children and six adults -- it was an announcement that their Outdoor Channel show 'Friends of NRA' was up for a 'Golden Moose' award.

Ready: The NRA has been silent since the Sandy Hill shootings, yet gun ranges are busy as always

And now, after being slammed by millions online for their gun rights advocacy, the group has taken down its Facebook page.

A day before the shootings, the NRA congratulated itself for getting 1.7 million 'likes' on Facebook.

The next day, the page was down.

Those who liked the NRA's Facebook page first noticed it was gone Friday, reports the Daily News.

The NRA was silent over the weekend.

Its
last Twitter update about a “10 Days of NRA Giveaways” was posted 
Friday morning, just as the mayhem at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 
Newtown began.

Aim: Three men hold their guns in cases as they walk to the entrance of Shooters Pistol Range in New Milford, Connecticut on Saturday

Fire: People wait to enter Shooters pistol range, not far from Newtown Adam Lanza shot 20 children and six adults, including his mother and himself

Meanwhile, gun owners are flocking to Shooters in New Milford, Connecticut, the nearest shooting range to Newtown.

According to The Gaurdian, Shooters was doing brisk business.

On Sunday, the range was open and it was business as usual as customers lined up outside waiting to take turns to squeeze off rounds in one of the 12 stations where shooters take aim at targets at up to 50 feet away.

The range rents out guns too, and advertises revolvers and semi-automatic 
handguns and rifles from .22 to .45 calibers.

Adam Lanza used a Bushmaster .223 semi-automatic rifle in the Sandy Hook shootings on Friday.

It is not known whether he visited Shooters, but it is the closest gun range to Newtown, according to the report.

Important issues: The day of the Sandy Hook shootings, the NRA didn't offer any sympathies but they did announce their Outdoor Channel show was being considered for the esteemed 'Golden Moose' awards

Mike D'Amico and his 14-year-old son were there Sunday for their weekly hour-long target practice.

'We enjoy it, it's our personal enjoyment,' D'Amico told The Gaurdian.

D'Amico also gave his opinion on President Obama's call for 'meaningful action' on gun control.

'I've
thought this for quite a while,' he said. 'I think we do need more gun 
control. I don't see the need people to carry some of these big guns. 
They're not appropriate.'

The NRA could not be reached for comment regarding their Facebook page or the Sandy Hook shootings.

There has no mention of the shootings on the NRA's web site.

Instead
there were stories about new developments in after-market items for AR 
assault rifles, similar to the type used in the Sandy Hook shootings.

On the day of the shooting, almost the minute Lanza walked into the school armed with a rifle and two handguns, the NRA 
announced on their web site that their Outdoor Channel show was up for a 'Golden Moose'
award.
