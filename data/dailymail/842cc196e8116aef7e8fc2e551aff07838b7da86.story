Career criminal: Robert Knowles who has 330 convictions and has appeared in court every year since 1959

A prolific shoplifter was  yesterday convicted of his 330th offence – as it emerged he has appeared in court every year since 1959.

Robert Knowles, 66, first broke the law when he was aged just 13, and has been adding to his criminal record ever since.

He was sent to a correctional school in 1959 and has been back in court 183 times over the subsequent 54 years.

His lawyer told the court he has become ‘institutionalised’ and steals so he can be returned to prison on his release.

Knowles has now been handed another prison sentence after taking two bottles of wine and three tins of fish worth a total of £14.15 from a Tesco Metro.

Judge Paul Darlow jailed the alcoholic for 123 days at Plymouth Crown Court – but because he has spent 61 days in custody already he was immediately released.

Knowles, from Plymouth, will remain on probation and receive help from social services.

The Crown Prosecution Service said afterwards it was unable to provide a full breakdown of his lifetime of offending because many  of the crimes pre-dated its creation in 1986.

Last year Knowles was jailed for stealing whisky miniatures the day after finishing a spell in prison.

Plymouth Crown Court heard the crook had £160 in his pocket at the time – and knew perfectly well he would be sent back to jail.

Recorder Robin Belben told him at last October’s hearing: ‘You have been caught in a revolving door over the last two or three years.

‘You commit an offence, you go to prison – and you commit another as soon as you are released.’ Knowles is said to be ‘resigned to spending the rest of his life in prison’ because he is unable to cope with living outside prison.

He typically steals something of low value every time he is released from jail, in an apparent attempt to get himself locked up again.

Serial offender: Knowles, 66, appeared before Judge Paul Darlow at Plymouth Crown Court - four years after the same judge had 'congratulated' him on clocking up 170 court appearances

In June 2011 Knowles admitted the theft of two bottles of whisky, watches and socks worth £279 from Marks and Spencer.

Worst offender: David Archer, 58, who has clocked up 342 convictions

During that hearing at Plymouth magistrates’ court his solicitor Alan Harris said: ‘He can cope very easily with prison but cannot cope very well with the world outside.

'This is as bleak a plea and mitigation as this court can ever wish to hear.’

Knowles left prison six months later and committed another shoplifting offence within a week, this time stealing a watch, sunglasses, underwear and socks worth £79.

* One in three criminals is a serial offender with at least 15 convictions.

There are more than 100,000 such criminals, 50 per cent more than a decade ago, official figures reveal.

Ministry of Justice figures published yesterday showed there were 302,940 offenders given a caution or conviction in 2012.

Of those some 34 per cent had at least 15 previous cautions or 
convictions on their record – or more than 102,000 individuals. Just one
in ten was a first-time offender.
