Three children and a teacher were viciously attacked by a stray dog after it found its way into the playground of a primary school.

The dog entered Ferny Creek Primary School in Melbourne's south-east during lunchtime, when more than 220 students were playing outside.

Two teachers on playground-duty rushed to the scene upon hearing the screams of children, and one was viciously attacked while he tried to tear the dog off an eight-year-old girl.

Three students and a teacher were left with injuries after a British bulldog, like the one pictured, attacked them in a primary school playground

The teachers attempted to coerce the dog away from the children while herding others back inside the buildings.

The three children, a seven and 10-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl, were bitten on the legs.

The two boys were instantly taken to Monash hospital by paramedics while the young girl was treated by paramedics at the scene.

They are in a stable condition and their injuries are not believed to have been serious.

The school's principal Matthew Coyle praised the teacher's actions.

'The teacher got bitten on the hand as he was trying to get the dog away from the kids, so well done to him and well done to his support staff,' Mr Coyle said on the Nine Network.

'They got the dog out onto the road completely away from the school.'

The two boys who were attacked were taken to Monash hospital by paramedics while the young girl was treated by paramedics at the scene

A spokeswoman for the Yarra Ranges Council said the dog, believed to be a 12-month-old English bulldog, was seized by council rangers.

The school was locked down for the rest of lunchtime while paramedics, police and the council were called.

The council is investigating the attack.
