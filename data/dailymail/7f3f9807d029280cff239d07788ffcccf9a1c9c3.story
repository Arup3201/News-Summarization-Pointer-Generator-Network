At least 17 people have been killed after a bomb blast inside a Sunni mosque in Iraq during Friday prayers.

The explosion rocked the Abu Bakr al-Sadiq mosque in Wajihiya, about 50 miles north east of Baghdad, injuring around 50 others.

It is the latest in a string of attacks on worshippers during the holy month of Ramadan with almost 200 people killed in suicide attacks, car bombings and other violence since it began last week.

The blast went off on the left side of the mosque, which was filled with men and children, as worshippers were kneeling during prayers, said 30-year-old Mohammed Faleh, who was praying inside.

Faleh said security forces found a second bomb left near the mosque that they rendered safe with a controlled detonation.

He said: 'I stood up to find blood-stained bodies lying on the ground. The Friday prayer turned into a disaster. Whoever left these bombs has no religion.'

The violence is an extension of a surge of attacks that has plagued Iraq for months, reviving fears of a return to the widespread sectarian bloodshed that pushed the country to the brink of civil war after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.

Diyala province, where the attack 
occurred, was once the site of some of the fiercest fighting between 
U.S. forces and insurgents in Iraq. It remains a hotbed for terrorist 
attacks.

The area is 
religiously mixed and witnessed some of the worst atrocities as Shiite 
militias battled Sunni insurgents for control in the years after the 
invasion.

Diyala provincial councilman Sadiq al-Husseini appealed for calm following today's explosion.

He
said: 'Terrorism is targeting all sects in Diyala mainly by attacking 
Sunni and Shiite mosques, funerals and football fields to draw the 
province into a sectarian conflict.

'All the victims were civilians.

'I call on all Diyala residents to show self-restraint.'

Police and hospital officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to release the information to media, confirmed the death toll. They warned that the number of dead could rise.

The attack struck while Iran's outgoing president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, wrapped up a two-day trip to Iraq with visits to Shiite Muslim holy cities of Najaf and Karbala south of Baghdad. There was no indication the mosque blast was related to his trips.

Violence across Iraq has risen sharply since a heavy-handed crackdown by security forces on a Sunni protest camp in the northern town of Hawija on April 23.

That raid followed months of rallies by Iraq's minority Sunnis against the Shiite-led government over what they contend is second-class treatment and the unfair use of tough anti-terrorism measures against their sect.

The surge in bloodshed has left more than 2,800 people dead and many more wounded since the start of April.

Attacks on Sunni mosques, for years a relatively rare target in Iraq, have picked up significantly in recent months.

There has been no claim of responsibility for Friday's bombing or many of the other recent attacks.
