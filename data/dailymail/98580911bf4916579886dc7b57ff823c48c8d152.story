A 3-year-old boy has shot himself in the head while visiting his grandfather, police said.

Kevin McDuffie, 49, was sleeping in the bedroom of his Charlotte, North Carolina, home Sunday when he heard a gunshot, then discovered his grandson lifeless with a bullet wound to the head in another room. He identified the little boy as Anthony.

'We had a bad tragedy. He shot himself,' the devastated McDuffie told the Charlotte Observer. 'When I went in the room, there was the little boy.'

The shooting was reported about 1:20 p.m. Sunday. The toddler was rushed to Carolinas Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

Police said they were treating the death as a tragic accident after preliminary investigations did not point to foul play.

Officials have not revealed whose gun was used in the shooting.

McDuffie told the Observer that he owns a concealed weapon permit but he keeps his gun hidden. He did not reveal where.

The grandfather said other family members were in the one-story brick house at the time of the incident, including one of his sons and another grandchild.

He told the newspaper his wife was at work.

All those who were at the home are cooperating with investigators and are being interviews, police said in a release.

The crime-scene was taped off Sunday afternoon.

McDuffie said he was close to his grandchildren who visited on alternate Sundays. He said he looked forward to the visits and particularly enjoyed cooking for the 3-year-old and his siblings.

'It's hard for me to even talk on the phone to anybody,' said McDuffie. 'I'm feeling really bad.'

Neighbor Amanda Howell, 19, recalled hearing a woman screaming outside Sunday afternoon.

'She fell down crying and screaming right in the yard,' Howell told the Observer.

Cassandra Lemmon, a cousin who lives on the same street, described the boy as 'the average little 3-year-old' and asked everyone to 'keep us in your prayers.'
