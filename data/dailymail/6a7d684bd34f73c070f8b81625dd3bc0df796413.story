A former Army staff sergeant set to receive the Medal of Honor for fighting off 200 Taliban despite being wounded in one of Afghanistan's bloodiest battles has said he would do it all over again

As he spoke at the National Guard Headquarters in Concord on Thursday, Ryan Pitts, 28, also paid tribute to the nine men who were killed on July 13, 2008 - and said they made him proud to have served.

The military 'was the greatest thing 
I've ever done in my life,' said Pitts, who is now a married father. 'It was the honor of my lifetime to
 serve with those guys and I would do it all over again.'

President Barack Obama will bestow
 the medal, which is the nation's highest decoration for battlefield valor, on Pitts during a White House ceremony on July 21.

Hero: Ryan Pitts, who is being awarded the Medal
 of Honor in July, talks about being wounded in Afghanistan in 
Concord, New Hampshire on Thursday. He paid tribute to the nine men who 
lost their lives that day

The former soldier from Nashua, New Hampshire, spent 90 minutes fighting off the attack on July 13, 2008 - despite shrapnel injuries 
to both legs and an arm that left him critically wounded.

On Thursday, he described the harrowing action of the battlefield and the pain of losing nine men that day he considered family.

He said that the award also belonged to Sergio Abad, Jonathan Ayers, Jason 
Bogar, Jonathan Brostrom, Israel Garcia, Jason Hovater, Matthew 
Phillips, Pruitt Rainey and Gunnar Zwilling.

'While it is an honor to have been 
nominated for the award, it is not mine alone,' he said. 'The honor 
belongs to every man who fought at Vehicle Patrol Base Kahler, 
especially to those who made the ultimate sacrifice that allowed the 
rest of us to return home.

'I
 have an absolute responsibility to tell our story, because there are 
nine men who cannot and it is their names you should know.'

Pitts recalled the moment Garcia died.

'There wasn't really anything we could do for him other than for me to give him the guarantee that I would come home and tell his wife and mother that he loved them and that he was thinking of them in his last moments,' he said.

Pitts kept his word.

He said he initially wasn't happy to learn that his actions were being reviewed.

'I never felt that I deserved it but since then, I've accepted the fact that this isn't mine,' he said. 'It belongs to everybody who was there that day because we did it together.'

He maintains that while he hasn't changed because of the medal, his outlook is renewed.

Missed: Gunnar Zwilling, 20, from Florissant, Missouri, left, and Pruitt Rainey, 22, from North Carolina also died

Tragedy: Matthew Phillips, 27, left, of Jasper, Georgia was killed in the fight - one of the bloodiest battles of the U.S. war in Afghanistan. He perished alongside comrade Jason Hovater, 25, right, of Clinton, Tennessee

'I know now that I'm going to live my life for those who aren't here because I owe it to them,' he said.

Pitts, who has fully recuperated from his injuries and is in business development at a software firm, was accompanied Thursday by his wife, Amy.

His face brightened when asked about life since the battle, clearly happy about his upcoming second wedding anniversary and their one-year-old son, Lucas.

When he someday tells the boy about what happened in Afghanistan, he said, 'I don't want to tell him about my experiences. I want to tell him about the other guys.'

He added: 'I want him to know he's here because of their actions. It's the only reason he's here because a lot of those guys saved my life.'

Casualties: Jonathan Ayers, 24, of Snellville, Georgia and Jonathan Brostrom, 24, of Hawaii were also killed

Fallen: Jason Bogar, 25, served with the National Guard before joining the Army a year before his death

The medal recognizes the ‘courageous 
actions’ shown by Pitts while he served as a forward observer when 
Vehicle Patrol Base Kahler, near Wanat Village in Kunar Province, came 
under full-scale attack.

Deep into battle, Pitts found himself alone at the observation post and losing blood.

He radioed to tell his superiors that everyone else was either dead or gone, but was told reinforcements were not available.

Resigned to death, he began firing a grenade launcher almost directly overhead to where insurgents had concealed themselves.

He
 also used a tactic known as 'cooking off' grenades, pulling the pin and
 holding it longer than usual so the enemy couldn't throw it back.

Four soldiers soon made their way from the casualty collection point to find Pitts fighting for his life.

They
 were followed by attack helicopters that provided air support. Despite 
being nearly unconscious, Pitts stayed in touch with headquarters and 
provided the feedback that was needed to help guide the air strikes.

He
 was evacuated after fighting for more than an hour despite his wounds, 
along with three of the soldiers who came to his aid. The fourth soldier
 had been fatally wounded.

‘Throughout
 the battle, despite the loss of blood and severity of his wounds, 
Pitts' incredible toughness, determination, and ability to communicate 
with leadership while under fire allowed U.S. forces to hold the 
(observation post) and turn the tide of the battle,’ according to the 
military's narrative of the battle.

‘Without
 his ability to stay alert and fight while critically wounded, the enemy
 would have gained a foothold on high ground and inflicted significantly
 greater causalities onto the vehicle patrol base, and the enemy could 
have been in possession of seven fallen Americans.’

Pitts
 left the service in October 2009 and currently works in business 
development for the computer software industry. He joined the Army in 
2003 at age 17.

Last week, 
Obama awarded the Medal of Honor to retired Cpl. William ‘Kyle’ 
Carpenter, who lost an eye after taking a grenade blast in Afghanistan 
to save a fellow Marine.
