The first ever academic journal dedicated entirely to the study of pornography has been announced by publishers Routledge. 

Called Porn Studies, it is due to launch next Spring and will feature academic papers that look into how pornographic books, films and other content impact our lives.

The rise in popularity of so-called 'Mummy Porn', including books such as the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, is expected to be one of the topics covered.

Porn and the pornography industry will be the subject of a new journal launching next Spring called Porn Studies. The journal will feature papers, articles and book reviews looking at how pornographic material affects society

The Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy is an erotic novel written by E.L James.

It was the fastest book to sell 1 million copies, beating books by Dan Brown and J.K Rowling.

It was also the first book to sell a million Kindle copies.

When the book was first released, over 4857 tweets were posted a day referencing the book and its characters.

The book's success led to the term 'Mummy Porn' being coined, because it was said to have been bought predominantly by housewives.

The journal will be edited by British academics Feona Attwood and Clarissa Smith.

Attwood is a media professor at Middlesex University and editor of Mainstreaming Sex: The Sexualization of Western Culture.

Clarissa Smith is a reader in sexual cultures at the University of Sunderland and founder member of the Onscenity Network, which ran the Sexual Cultures Conference in April.

Attwood and Smith are asking for submissions from academics in sociology, film, media, law and criminology.

The editors believe that pornography studies are still 'in their infancy' and hope to rectify that with Porn Studies.

The Fifty Shades of Grey books, dubbed 'Mummy Porn' because they were said to have been bought predominantly by housewives, divided opinion when they were released. Studies into how sexually explicit books such as these will form the basis of the new Porn Studies journal

Publisher Routledge said: 'Porn Studies will be the first dedicated, international, peer-reviewed journal to critically explore those cultural products and services designated as pornographic and their cultural, economic, historical, institutional, legal and social contexts.'

Adding it will pay particular attention to 'the intersection of sexuality, gender, race, class, age and ability.'

The journal will be a mix of papers, articles and book reviews.

The editors are currently looking for submissions for its first issue due to print in Spring 2014.
