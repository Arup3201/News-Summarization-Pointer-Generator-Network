The father-of-four accused of running a string of Manhattan brothels funded the operation with thousands of dollars provided by his mother, it has been claimed.

Sheila Thomas, 64, may have unwittingly provided $45,000 in loans to her son William Thomas for the sleazy operation.

Thomas, 42, a former IT company expert, was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of running four brothels from the Financial District to the Upper East Side.

Mrs Thomas has had bit parts in movies including Robert De Niro's Good Shepherd and made many TV commercials.

In early 2008, she gave her son $10,000, according to bankruptcy filings seen by the New York Post. 

Calls to Mrs Thomas by MailOnline went unanswered today.

Several months earlier, Thomas has registered Aaron Integrated Care - which police claim was a shell business for his prostitution ring. 

Mrs Thomas, who has also starred in the HBO series Mildred Pierce with Kate Winslet, then provided a $25,000 loan in January 2009 and another $10,000 four months later.

Police claim William Thomas had created two sleazy websites to promote his 
hooker business, which charged between $200 to $300 an hour for sex with Asian women.

These
were overseen in four brothels on Maiden Lane, Sixth Avenue near 37th 
Street, East 50th Street and East 58th Street, authorities allege.

Last June, William Thomas was sued for repayment of the $45,000 - but has not paid any of the money back.

His ex-wife Susan told the New York Post this week that she was the one who alerted the authorities to Thomas' alleged scheme.

She had brought the father of her two
teenage sons to court over $100,000 in unpaid child support and took 
the opportunity to alert authorities to what she had seen at his 
apartment - allegedly 'large amounts of cash...and the website on his 
computer'.

One of Thomas's teenage sons appeared shocked by news 
of his father's arrest, taking to Twitter yesterday to make the apparently 
sarcastic comment: 'Awesome dad! way to make the thomas family proud.'

He added: 'Pretty
surreal to hear your dad’s name on the news in connection to a massive 
prostitution ring bust. had to happen eventually i guess.'

His last comment suggests he already knew something about the allegations or the arrest.

Neighbors
said Thomas had been living quietly in an apartment in Fort Greene with
his one-year-old son, the boy's mother and his three-year-old daughter 
from a previous marriage.

He was described as a 'quiet guy' and 'always friendly'.

A source said Thomas married his second wife, half-Korean beauty
So Young, who apparently had the connections he needed for his business
venture. They had a daughter, now three, but divorced in March, a 
source told the New York Post.

Thomas was arrested and charged with 
promoting prostitution after an undercover cop posed as a customer who 
wanted to have sex with an Asian woman.

He connected with Thomas on websites 
www.E4AKorea.com and www.E4ANYC.com. The 42-year-old was arrested on 
October 11 and posted $10,000 bail two days later.

On the websites, which have since been taken down, pictures of half-naked Asian women promising 'Your Midtown Korean experience' and the 'girlfriend experience' for up to $300 an hour were advertised.

Hookers are shown posing topless and in lingerie on his website, for services at his brothels. Pictured here is the midtown brothel

'GFE's do multipop on an hour rate basis,' the websites detail, indicating the hooker would have sex multiple times.

The undercover officer kept in touch 
with Thomas by email and text and 'became a member of the E4AKorea 
private men’s club', prosecutors said in court.

He then went to one of the brothels and met a Korean woman who 
introduced herself as 'Olivia' and told him he could kiss her but had to
wear a condom during sex.

The 
complaint said: 'The undercover officer asked for a 
Japanese girl, and [Rei Spain] said the Japanese girls don’t do full 
service, only massage and "happy ending" for $100 plus $40 tip.'

Two
women, Jung Lee, 28, of Queens, and Rei Spain, 38, of Long Island, were
also arrested for prostitution and promoting prostitution. Lee is being held at Riker's Island and Spain was released without bail

Thomas’
services also included overseas travel, but this probe only targeted 
Manhattan operations, according to the Manhattan DA.
