Arrested: Kendra Hampton is accused of leaving her three children alone in a bedroom so she could go drinking

The woman's boyfriend said Hampton began drinking at 1pm on Saturday and that she had been 'drinking alcohol excessively for the past few months', News 13 reported. 

After he vacated the house and left her with the three kids, Hampton decided she 'needed a break' and headed to the bar. 

Two adults who were home at the time said they didn't know Hampton had left the children alone.
