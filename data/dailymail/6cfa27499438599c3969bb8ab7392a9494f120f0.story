In three months England are off again, this time in the European Championship qualifiers. Some familiar faces will disappear, and some younger names will emerge in the squad.

As the post-mortem into England’s dismal performance in Brazil continues, who will be in and who will be out for the first qualifier against Switzerland in September?

Joe Hart

The 27-year-old goalkeeper has been unnecessarily overworked because of the deficiencies in front of him. Continues to be England’s best option. Also belts out the national anthem to set a great example to the others.

VERDICT: IN

Beaten: Joe Hart could do nothing about Luis Suarez's late winner against England 

Glen Johnson

The Liverpool defender bristles at suggestions he is a weak link but the fact remains he would not have played had Kyle Walker been fit. Part of the 2010 shambles and, at the age of 29, cannot be regarded as an option for the next World Cup.

VERDICT: OUT

Out of form: Right-back Glen Johnson assisted the goal, but was suspect defensively in both games

Leighton Baines

Poor old Baines. Waits all that time behind Ashley Cole and when he gets his chance is made to look anything but solid. With Luke Shaw loitering in the background, the 29-year-old Everton left back will be coming under increasing pressure and could find himself back in the understudy role.

VERDICT: IN

Trier: Leighton Baines struggled against Italy and never delivered the set piece quality he is renowned for

Steven Gerrard (c)

The combined weight of Liverpool’s title expectations and England’s World Cup hopes turned out to be too heavy for the skipper. He has looked mentally and physically exhausted. The slip against Chelsea and the giveaway header against Uruguay are sad memories for the 33-year-old, who will surely call it a day after this.

VERDICT: OUT

End of days? At 34, chances are Steven Gerrard's England career could be coming to a close

Gary Cahill

Had a wonderful season alongside John Terry (remember him?) and is likely to be the senior central defender going forward despite being bettered by Mario Balotelli and Luis Suarez.  Needs to form a strong partnership with one of the young guns. At 28, he has another four-year cycle in him.

VERDICT: IN

Battler: Gary Cahill was tussing with Luis Suarez all night aganst Uruguay

Phil Jagielka

Fronted up after the defeat against Uruguay and a wonderful servant to Everton but the time may have come for the central defender. Jagielka is 31 and was made to look it against world-class opposition. John Stones and Steve Caulker are waiting in the wings.

VERDICT: OUT

Caught out: Phil Jagielka looked out of his depth at times, and should have done better for both goals

Jack Wilshere

When fit there is none better than the Arsenal star. He can occupy a holding role, a roving role, and a scoring role. Wilshere’s future will be defined by whether he can steer clear of the treatment table. No longer regarded as the answer to all England’s midfield problems thanks to the talent on offer.

VERDICT: IN

Lacking impact: Jack Wilshere struggled in a short cameo against Italy, and remained on the bench throughout against Uruguay

Frank Lampard

The view from the bench must have been a frustrating one for Lampard, whose main role at this World Cup would be one of morale-booster and leader by example. The stalwart is 36 so whatever way you look at it, this is goodbye.

VERDICT: OUT

Frustrating: Frank Lampard provides invaluable experience off the pitch, but failed to get on it in either game

Daniel Sturridge

Hard to believe that the Liverpool striker has come through such a gruelling domestic campaign. Looked fresh, acted as if he was delighted to be in Brazil and won over hearts and minds. Scored against Italy and was England’s most threatening player against Uruguay. Lovely celebration too.

VERDICT: IN

Promising: Daniel Sturridge scored the leveller against Italy, but struggled to impose himself against Uruguay

Wayne Rooney

Broke his World Cup duck, provided the cross for Sturridge’s goal and ran a marathon but also missed too many chances. Survived the chop against Uruguay. Still England’s main striker but what happens next could come down to Louis van Gaal at United and how he deploys Robin van Persie. 

VERDICT: IN

Breakthrough: Wayne Rooney finally broke his World Cup duck against Uruguay, but it could have been so much more

Danny Welbeck

Someone needs to get inside the brain of the Manchester United striker. Roy Hodgson’s belief in him has not been justified and it appears Welbeck’s insistence he wants a central role is hindering his progress. Needs to start playing/scoring more regularly for United to get his place back.

VERDICT: OUT

Energetic: Danny Welbeck provided plenty of running over the two games, but very little end product

Chris Smalling

Like Jones, has probably paid for United’s very disappointing season. Missed Euro 2012 through injury and has had niggling problems since. At the age of 24 Smalling can no longer be regarded as a kid and he may just have missed the boat.

VERDICT: OUT

Action-less: Chris Smalling didn't see a minute of action during either game, but struggled during the warm-ups

Ben Foster

Always difficult for a second-choice goalkeeper. The West Brom player is 31 now and Roy Hodgson may feel it is time to bring in John Ruddy and Under-21 Jack Butland for the European Championships but Foster is a steady stand-by.

VERDICT: IN

Backup: Ben Foster remains a solid alternative to number one Joe Hart

Jordan Henderson

Having
won over all his critics at Liverpool, the midfielder may have to do it all
over again for his country. Henderson worked his socks off in the two games but
was shown up by ‘old man’ Andrea Pirlo. Will continue to be a useful squad
member but team spot under pressure.

VERDICT: IN

Work ethic: Jordan Henderson put in a decent shift alongside Gerrard in both games

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain

Remember that fresh-faced Arsenal youngster from Euro 2012? Injuries have stalled the Ox but, at the age of 20, the winger still has time on his side. Will be competing with Arsenal team-mate Theo Walcott, not to mention England’s other young Lions. It could come down to character as well as class.

VERDICT: IN

Cut short: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's knee injury kept him out of both England games, it now looks as though he won't have the chance to make an impact

VIDEO Uruguay elated as England sit on the brink 

Phil Jones

The Manchester United defender is still only 22 but still has to live up to his potential. Not had a chance to shine in Brazil but Hodgson appears not to rate him highly enough to play either at right back or in central defence. Deserves another chance.

VERDICT: IN

Step up: With question marks surrounding the defence, Phil Jones must take chance to prove himself

James Milner

Unfairly pilloried because successive England managers keep picking him but the wealth of attacking talent coming through means that the Manchester City utility man may well find himself sliding down the pecking order and right out of the international scene. Will keep fighting though.

VERDICT: OUT

Redundant: With England not having a lead to defend, James Milner wasn't called upon for his trademark workrate

Rickie Lambert

It would be such a shame if this turned out to be a cameo tournament for the Liverpool striker but the omens are not good. Former Southampton team-mate Jay Rodriguez will be knocking on the door and Andy Carroll might start hitting form for West Ham. The 32-year-old may have had his day.

VERDICT: OUT

Hard luck: Rickie Lambert deserved better than just a five minute 'Plan B' cameo against Uruguay

Raheem Sterling

Ah, that’s the problem with the kids. Sterling is a truly exciting young talent but as good as he was against Italy, the reverse was true against Uruguay. Think back to when he broke into the Liverpool team – Brendan Rodgers had to take him out again for a while. Still only 19 and a big prospect.

VERDICT: IN

Light & shade: Raheem Sterling was superb against Italy, but anonymous versus Uruguay

Adam Lallana

In terms of age Lallana is not a baby but in terms of experience the 26-year-old is still wearing international L plates. He has not been given enough opportunity to show what he can do in Brazil and deserves another go on the big stage, especially if continues to shine in the Premier League.

VERDICT: IN

Cameos: Adam Lallana came on in both games for England, but struggled to assert himself

Ross Barkley

There was a palpable sense of excitement when the Everton youngster came on as substitute against Uruguay. He ran at players and looked to do something different. It is tough being lauded as the next big thing in England football but Barkley looks like he can handle the hype.

VERDICT: IN

Experience: Ross Barkley's time in Brazil will be invaluable for him going forward

Fraser Forster

If Foster thought he had a tough gig, spare a thought for Forster who was never going to get a game in a month of Sundays. If Foster stays then Forster is likely to be the one jettisoned for youth but it could easily go the other way.

VERDICT: OUT

Third choice: Fraser Forster was never realistically going to get a game at the World Cup

Luke Shaw

The clamour for the Southampton teenager continues but whether the 18-year-old would have done any better against the canny Italians and the wily Uruguayans is open to debate. Continues to get better and better on the bench, however, and a big prospect for the future.

VERDICT: IN

Successor: Despite not getting onto the pitch, Luke Shaw still seems the likely replacement for Ashley Cole

VIDEO Hodgson needs Italian miracle 

Presuming Roy Hodgson is still coach in September for their opening Euro 2016 qualifying match away in Switzerland, the first names on his team-sheet are surely Hart, Sturridge, Cahill and Rooney. 

Wilshere taking the Gerrard role is an obvious one too but Henderson might come under pressure from Jones. Having Sturridge, Barkley and Sterling as an attacking trio behind Rooney means no Oxlade-Chamberlain, no Lallana.

Easy isn’t it, Roy?

Possible England starting line-up v Switzerland (4-2-3-1)

Hart; Walker, Stones, Cahill, Shaw; Wilshere, Henderson; Sturridge, Barkley, Sterling; Rooney.

England 2-1 defeat to Uruguay and Costa Rica's win over Italy means Roy Hodgson's men are OUT
