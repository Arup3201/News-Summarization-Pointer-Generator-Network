Mr Resto, who also denied seven counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, told police his wife was upset with him because he did not buy her a Christmas gift, reports the station, CBS News reports.

She is said to have stayed with a friend on December 26 and had been avoiding him until she sent a text on December 30 saying he needed to move out of their shared home. 

Court documents say she returned later that night, and was killed after refusing to speak to her husband.  

Police claim after he stabbed her, Mr Resto made a failed attempt to kill himself by stuffing a towel in the exhaust pipe of his car.

Prosecutors say he then drove to Waltham police headquarters, walked in with a knife in his hand and shouted out to officers, 'Shoot me. I have nothing to live for. I just killed my wife,' reports the station.

Police officers reportedly used a beanbag gun to subdue him before arresting him. 

Officers then went to the couple's home and found Gloria Resto's body - they also found her son asleep in his bed unharmed

Mrs Resto's aunt said she was a devoted mother to her two children and the entire family is distraught.
