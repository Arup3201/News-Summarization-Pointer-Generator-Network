Coldplay frontman Chris Martin is at the center of rumors that he has struck up a friendship with British fashionista and TV host Alexa Chung.

A number of U.S. websites have linked the couple together just days after the musician announced his split from wife Gwyneth Paltrow.

The 37-year-old musician enjoyed a late-night milkshake with Alexa, 30, at Glastonbury music festival in the UK last June, with Jessica Goldsack, who served the pair, today telling MailOnline: 'They turned up together at around 3 or 4am and came over to where I was working at Shaken Udder and said to me and my friend 'what do you recommend?'

'They looked like they were just chilling and having a good time. I did find it a little odd that they were together - but we had a little chat and they wandered off after they asked us if we knew of any good places to go and have a few drinks.'

Jessica asked the pair for a picture and posed separately with them, posting it on her Instagram account and calling them 'both so lovely'.

She added: 'They were having a laugh together, but it didn't seem that anything was going on.'

Chris was seen with his children, daughter Apple, nine, and son Moses, seven, at the festival - with his soon to be ex-wife Gwyneth not accompanying them.

LaineyGossip.com today mentioned Chris and Alexa together, writing: '...if we were to play a preliminary game of replacements, who would you suggest for Gwyneth? (After the appropriate mourning period, obviously.) Let’s get into that tomorrow. For Chris though… I’m thinking… Alexa Chung?'

While The Hollywood Gossip also wrote about the friends.

MailOnline has contacted representatives for both Chris and Alexa over the reports.

Alexa's close friend, New York fashion queen and socialite Lauren Santo Domingo tweeted shortly after news of the Gwyneth and Chris's split broke on Tuesday: 'Chris Martin is eating a bacon cheeseburger right now. With fries.'

Alexa was in a serious relationship with Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner for four years until their split until 2011 and she went on to state that he was still her 'best friend' - despite admitting she was left heartbroken from their break-up saying: 'I don't know whether to be open and vulnerable about it and say, 'I had a shit time', or to be quiet.'

Today, it was reported that Chris was
 seen partying with two brunette beauties at a Grammys after party in 
late January – just two months before his split from Oscar winner Gwyneth, 41, was
 announced.

Chris was caught on camera with a group of friends outside the Sunset
 Tower Hotel party following the awards ceremony on January 26.

A video features Chris, whose joint split statement with Gwyneth revealed their marriage had been on the rocks for almost a year beforehand, leaving the Warner Music bash with the two women in tow.

The singer was seen partying with several beauties, one of which was Keshia Gerrits (left), who has just this week got engaged to the singer's Coldplay bandmate Guy Berryman.

Chris was seen soon after Gwyneth was pictured kissing her ex-boyfriend Donovan Leitch at a baseball game in Los Angeles, in September last year.

The Glee star and the British actor – who dated in the 1990s - were seen very openly kissing on the mouth while sitting front row at a Los Angeles Dodgers game with her and Chris' daughter Apple, nine, and son Moses, seven, sat alongside them.

However, a spokesperson for the actress denied any romantic involvement between the pair, telling MailOnline: 'Gwyneth has been close friends with Donovan for over 20 years.

'There is no romantic relationship between them whatsoever. There is no other person involved as is clear in the letter from Gwyneth and Chris on Goop.'

On Tuesday, Gwyneth broke the news about her and Chris' split on her Goop lifestyle website.

She wrote: 'It is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate.'

In their emotional, somewhat bizarrely entitled, statement on the site called 'Conscious Uncoupling', Gwyneth, 41, and Chris admitted they had spent more than a year battling to save their marriage.

They wrote: 'We have been working hard for well over a year, some of it together, some of it separated, to see what might have been possible between us, and we have come to the conclusion that while we love each other very much we will remain separate.

'We are, however, and always will be a family, and in many ways we are closer than we have ever been.

'We are parents first and foremost, to two incredibly wonderful children and we ask for their and our space and privacy to be respected at this difficult time.

'We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and co-parent, we will be able to continue in the same manner.'

The couple are now having a 'break-up moon'. The day before announcing their separation, they flew to the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas,

A representative for Chris Martin declined to comment when approached by MailOnline.
