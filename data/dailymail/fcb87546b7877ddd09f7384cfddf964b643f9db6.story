Electric car company Tesla Motors will produce a driverless car within the next three years, according to its chief executive, Elon Musk.

The move will see Tesla overtake Google, who three years ago began the race to bring driverless cars on to the road.

Google’s programme, however, has been slow to get off the ground because carmakers are worried about potential liabilities from accidents, according to a source speaking to the Financial Times.

Tesla Motors will produce a driverless car within the next three years, according to its chief executive, Elon Musk. Its autonomous car would allow the driver to hand over 90 per cent of the control of the car

California-based Tesla said its autonomous car would allow the driver to hand 90 per cent of the control of the car over to the vehicle's computer system.

Fully autonomous cars would take longer to develop, said Musk, in an interview with the Financial Times.

The self-driving car would be developed in-house using Tesla's own technology, not that of another company, Musk said in comments confirmed by a Tesla spokesperson.

Tesla's online job board currently has a post for an Advanced Driver Assistance Systems Controls Engineer, who will be responsible for helping ‘Tesla's effort to pioneer fully automated driving.’

Prior to this announcement, Tesla had been one of the leading contenders to collaborate with Google on its driverless car programme.

Google has already fitted out several cars with radar-like equipment that lets them navigate roads in California and Nevada.

California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law last year allowing the Mountain View-based internet giant to test its self-driving cars on the road.

Google did not immediately respond to an enquiry about the status of its driverless car programme.

Musk's three-year timeline is more ambitious than those set out by other car makers, as well as analysts that say it will take 10 to 15 years before self-driving cars become a reality.

Germany's Daimler AG and Japan's Nissan have both said they hope to begin selling self-driving cars by the end of the decade.

Daimler already offers technology that allows for partly automated driving such as traffic jam assistance in its top-line S-Class Mercedes, which can maintain distance to other cars in stop-and-go situations.

As well as technical obstacles, legal and safety issues must be overcome before driverless cars are allowed on the road.

European Union laws currently call for drivers to control their cars at all times.

And it is unclear whether the multi-billion dollar car insurance industry has any appetite to back the cars until the technology is proven.

Elon Musk, 42, was born in Pretoria, South Africa before moving to Canada and later the U.S.

By the time he reached 12 
year's old he had created and sold his first software program - a space 
game called Blastar - for around $500.

Musk
 started Zip2 - an online content publishing software - in 1998 with his
 brother, Kimbal Musk, which was bought in 1999 by Compaq's AltaVista 
division for a reported $300million.

Musk
 then co-found X.com  and
 a year later this firm merged with Confinity, which later became known 
as PayPal.

In October 
2002, PayPal was bought by eBay for $1.5billion in stock and Musk, the 
company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7 per cent of these shares. 

In June 2002 Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX). SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles.

SpaceX
 was awarded a billion-dollar Nasacontract in December 2008, for 12 
flights of their Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the 
International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after it 
retired in 2011.

Musk
 is also co-founder and head of product design at Tesla Motors. He was 
previously CEO of the company but due to reported layoffs in the 
company, he took a different position in 2008.

He is reported to have a 32 per cent stake in the car company, which is currently valued above $12 billion, as of 29 May 2013.

Additionally,
 Musk provided the initial concept for SolarCity, which was co-found 
with his cousin Lyndon Rive, and Musk is the company's largest 
shareholder and chairman of the board.

SolarCity is the largest provider of solar power systems in the U.S His cousin Lyndon Rive is the CEO and co-founder.
