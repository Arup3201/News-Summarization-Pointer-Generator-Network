At first they said they wouldn't but The Broadway League dimmed their lights on Tuesday night for Joan Rivers in the city that never sleeps.

Hundreds of New York theatergoers and passersby stopped to see the dimmed lights of the theater marquees, just one day after The Broadway League said that TV personality Joan Rivers didn't officially qualify as a Broadway star.

'Joan Rivers loved Broadway and we loved her. Due to the outpouring of love and respect for Joan Rivers from our community and from her friends and fans worldwide, the marquees of Broadway theaters in New York will be dimmed in her memory tonight, at exactly 6:45pm for one minute,' said Charlotte St. Martin, Executive Director of The Broadway League before the much anticipated event.

 'I think it’s the most publicized dimming in history and that’s how it should be for Joan Rivers, period,' theater producer Tom D’Angora told WCBS 880’s Jim Smith.

Rivers, who died last week at the age of 81, was initially excluded from the honor because she had not acted on Broadway in 20 years. Rivers appeared on Broadway three times and was nominated for a Tony Award in 1994.

The tradition is that Broadway lowers its lights every time a theater celebrity dies. Even though Joan Rivers was not a current theater celebrity, it was her lifelong love of theater that made the Broadway League reverse their decision. 

'Joan Rivers loved Broadway and we loved her,' said
Charlotte St. Martin, executive director of The Broadway League,
which represents producers and theater owners.

After the initial decision not to dim the lights, Off-Broadway producer Tom
D'Angora started an online petition urging the Broadway League
to change its decision. He collected more than 4,400 signatures.

Brooklyn-born Rivers, known for her brash style and the
catchphrase, 'Can we talk?,' died last Thursday at a New York
hospital after she stopped breathing during a procedure at a
medical clinic.

Rivers, who had a long career as a stand-up comedian, TV
host, author and reality star, was nominated for a best actress
Tony for 1994's 'Sally Marr ... and Her Escorts,' which she
wrote.

She also wrote and appeared in the comedy play Fun City in
the early 1970s, and more than a decade later in the comedy Broadway Bound.
