Police have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with a spate of attacks on pensioners sneezing in Carlisle 

A thug is believed to be randomly attacking pensioners shopping in the street who dare to sneeze.

Police have received five reports of a man slapping people in Carlisle town centre who sneezed, including from a 65-year-old woman who was hit on the head.

Officers have released CCTV images of the man they are looking for, who is targeting 'innocent members of the public.' 

They said the offence was certainly unique, and they were treating it incredibly seriously.  

The first reported incident occurred took place on February 19 between 11.15am and 11.30am outside the Andalusian bar in Warwick Road in Carlisle.

The victim was a 65-year-old woman who was slapped on the head after sneezing.

On 17 March an 82-year-old woman was also targeted by a man, who police believe is the same attacker.

PC Mike Watson, of Cumbria Constabulary said: 'This is certainly a unique type of incident and one that is being treated seriously by ourselves.

'The offender is assaulting innocent members of the public and that sort of behaviour will not be tolerated.

'We would also like to appeal to anyone who may be a victim to come forward as your information could bring this offender to justice.

'We would like to speak to the person pictured in the CCTV image in connection with these offences. 

'We appeal to anyone who recognises him to make contact, any information provided could be crucial to our investigation.' 

Other reports of incidents included a 77-year-old woman from Carlisle being attacked on February 24, and a 67-year-old man being targeted at the town's bus station on March 4. 

Just three days later a 65-year-old woman was attacked in The Lanes Shopping Centre. 

Most of the attacks took place between 11am and 12.30pm on each of the days.  

The man is said to be targeting people in Carlisle town centre, slapping them when they sneeze 

As well as the five reports, police have been informed of two further incidents where the victim has not yet come forward. 

The man is believed to be in his 50s. 

Shoppers in Carlisle are said to have been confused by the incident. 

Gemma Prosser, 19, a trainee shop assistant, said: 'We heard as it happened in the town centre and at first we just thought it was a bit weird. 

'When you think about it, it is really awful because anyone can sneeze at any time and it's not your fault.'
