A U.S. Army sergeant who allegedly murdered three unarmed Afghan civilians casually shot one victim ‘with a smile on his face’, a court heard.

Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs then pulled a tooth from the dead man's mouth, a fellow soldier testified at a hearing in Tacoma, Washington.

The chilling account followed testimony from several other ex-peers of Gibbs who recalled that he referred to Afghan villagers as ‘savages’.

Portraits were painted of Gibbs as a cold-blooded, renegade squad leader who hated those he was supposed to be protecting from Taliban forces.

He allegedly once told another soldier ‘the Army needs more people who can kill people,’ a court martial at Joint Base Lewis-McChord heard.

But defence lawyers were trying to discredit the prosecution's star witness, former Army Specialist Jeremy Morlock.

They used a video clip he shot of himself delivering a profanity-laced, racist diatribe against a group of Afghan men detained by U.S. troops.

Morlock's ranting, craven appearance in the video contrasted sharply with his calm and focused demeanour in court earlier this week.

He had taken the stand to paint Gibbs as the instigator behind murders of innocent villagers staged to look like legitimate combat engagements.

Morlock was previously sentenced to 24 years in prison for his role in the same three killings with which Gibbs is charged.

He quoted Gibbs on Monday as telling him: ‘We can get away with it. It's that easy.’

The court-martial caps an 18-month investigation of the most egregious case of U.S. military atrocities during 10 years of war in Afghanistan.

The killings were initially exposed through a probe of rampant drug abuse among soldiers.

Photos seized as evidence in the case showed Morlock, Gibbs and other soldiers posing grinning with the bodies of Afghan casualties.

They have drawn comparisons to the inflammatory Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in Iraq in 2004.

Gibbs, 26, of Billings, Montana, is the highest-ranking of five men from an infantry unit charged with murdering villagers in Kandahar province.

He was also charged with cutting fingers off bodies as war trophies and beating a fellow soldier who alerted superiors to hashish use in their unit.

Seven other Stryker soldiers were charged with lesser offenses. Most already have reached plea deals and have been sentenced.

One of them, Ashton Moore, convicted on drug charges, testified about a conversation between him and Gibbs

He was allegedly asked by Gibbs if he would be willing to shoot an Afghan without knowing whether he was an enemy combatant.

‘I said, “no” (and) he said, “I think the Army needs more people who can kill people”,’ Moore recalled.

The climax of proceedings came in testimony from former Army Specialist Adam Winfield, 23.

It was about how he, Gibbs and other 
troops searched a village for Taliban activity in a routine patrol last 
year and found a family inside a home.

'Is this the guy?'

‘Just an old man, his family and a bunch of kids, just a normal house, nothing going on,’ Winfield said.

He recounted Gibbs gestured at the man and asked, ‘Is this the guy?’, then discussed how the man might have attacked them with a grenade.

Having heard Gibbs and Morlock boast about two previous slayings, Winfield testified, he realised this was the next ‘guy to be killed.’

Gibbs then led the individual outside and around a corner.

‘It was just a matter of seconds - boom, boom, boom,’ Winfield testified, adding that Gibbs ordered the others to yell, ‘Grenade, grenade!’

This was as he set off an actual grenade that mangled the victim's legs, then yelled at his men, ‘You guys were supposed to shoot.’

Gibbs allegedly then moved close enough to see the victim lying on the ground and ‘shot him two more times with a smile on his face.’

He then allegedly bent down and ‘pulled a tooth from the guy’ and offered it to Winfield, who said he replied, astonished, ‘I'll just get it later.’

Winfield himself pleaded guilty in August to a reduced charge of involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to three years in prison.

A fourth co-defendant charged as a member of the 5th Stryker Brigade ‘kill team,’ Andrew Holmes, pleaded guilty two months ago to one murder.

‘(He) shot him two more times with a smile on his face'Adam Winfield on Calvin Gibbs

He was sentenced to seven years in prison. The fifth soldier charged with murder, Michael Wagnon, still faces a court-martial.

If convicted on all charges, Gibbs faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

He pleaded not guilty on the first day of his court-martial last Friday. The trial is expected to run through at least the end of next week.
