Security is likely to be pretty tight at the sprawling mansion that is home to multi-millionaire footballer John Terry and his family.

But it seems the Chelsea defender is taking extra precautions these days, as he was spotted browsing the covert cameras and bugging devices on offer in a London spy shop.

Gadgets on sale at the Spymaster range from night-vision goggles and bullet-proof leather jackets, to a tiny video camera concealed in a box of tissues.

Terry, 31, was said to have asked staff for a demonstration of some of the products on sale during his visit to the shop.

On its website Spymaster is described as the city's best-equipped spy shop 'providing for all your surveillance, counter-surveillance, personal protection and related security needs'.

It says Spymaster offers a 'discreet and confidential service'.

Alongside the document scanners and spy phones, the store also stocks Luminox watches, which are worn by military groups including the U.S. Airforce and the Navy SEALS.

Should he have been in the mood to indulge his inner James Bond further, Terry could have also picked up a handheld bug detector or a document scanner.
