After confirming the use of the vanishing spray seen at the World Cup, the Premier League has reportedly ordered 2,000 cans for referees to use for the next season, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Even then, officials are hoping they will last the season, with the spray poised to mark 10 yards for defensive walls as well as initial positioning of a free-kick.

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said: ‘We are open to developments that enhance the competition and it was clear from watching the World Cup that vanishing spray benefited referees, players, and all of those who watched the matches.’

The spray will make its Premier League debut when Manchester United take on Swansea City on August 16.
