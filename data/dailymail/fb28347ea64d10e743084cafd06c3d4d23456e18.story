Christian Eriksen can go on to emulate the likes of Paul Gascoigne and Glenn Hoddle at Tottenham Hotspur.

That is the opinion of Jan Vertonghen, the man who persuaded the Dane to follow him from Ajax to White Hart Lane in 2013.

Eriksen has been outstanding for Spurs this season and was again the star man during Wednesday’s 4-0 victory over Newcastle United in the quarter-final of the Capital One Cup.

The £11million playmaker is still only 22 years old and, having won the club’s Player of the Year prize in his first season, Vertonghen believes his former Ajax team-mate can become a Spurs great.

‘I know the reputation of Hoddle and Gascoigne, I think Christian can be one of the best players of Spurs,’ said the Belgium defender.

‘As a playmaker he can be one of the best in the Premier League. I have played with him since he was 16, 17, for six or seven years now. I think he is improving in every season.

‘In Ajax, near the end, they said his stats weren’t as good as they should be. But I think he shows now that he can score and give assists.

‘And he’s a very hard worker, he’s the first on the training pitch and there until the last minute. I am a big fan of him and I’m happy I convinced him to come here.’

Vertonghen joined Spurs 12 months before Eriksen, and he added: ‘We had good contact when he was still at Ajax. We always kept in contact. They asked me what I thought of him, I was very positive. I think I did my job to convince him to come here.’

Eriksen has scored three in his last five league games to take his tally for the season to six and has been at the heart of Spurs’ recent revival under Mauricio Pochettino.

And Vertonghen believes he is taking more responsibility, especially from a withdrawn role behind striker Harry Kane.

‘He is definitely more dominant now,’ he said. ‘We need him on the ball as much as possible.

‘When he is playing from the left he is coming inside, and when he is playing as a No 10 he has even more influence. When he is on the ball something always happens. It is good for the team.’
