The father of kidnapped Abigail Hernandez has spoken for the first time since his daughter mysteriously returned home and said, ‘I’m desperate for answers. I’m as much in the dark as anyone else’.

Ruben Hernandez is overjoyed that Abigail is finally back with her mother, unharmed, nine months after she disappeared on her way home from school.

But he says he is as baffled as everyone else about the way she suddenly went missing, days before her 15th birthday and then suddenly came home.

Speculation has raged since Abby reappeared on Sunday July 20, apparently walking back into her North Conway home, wearing the same clothes she was last seen in.

Despite arresting Nathaniel Kibby and charging him with kidnapping, the Attorney General’s office has released very little information about the crime.

And Mr Hernandez, who is divorced from Abby’s mother Zenya, says he has barely been told anything about his daughter’s abduction.

Speaking on Friday the 61-year-old said he had seen her briefly once, but he did not want to push her on where she had been, or what had happened to her.

‘All I can say is I am so happy and relieved Abby is back home’, he said talking to MailOnline. ‘I honestly never thought I was going to see her again.

'I believe it is a miracle that she has come home unharmed. It could have been so much worse. It is an answer to all my prayers.’

He went on: ‘I'm in the dark as much as anyone, I am looking for answers like everyone else.

‘I'm her father, I want to know what happened more than anyone, I'm desperate for answers. How do you think I feel? It's terrible that I don't know what happened to my own daughter.

‘You would have thought I would be kept informed, but I haven't been. I have talked to the police, but they don't know.

‘Even if Abby lived here and even if I had custody the police still wouldn't be able to tell me anything because it's an open investigation.’

He has seen Abby once since July 20, but he says that meeting did not shed any light on the past nine months.

‘The short time I spent with Abby, well, you can tell when not to push someone’, he said. ‘I hope she will let me know what happened when she is ready.

‘We have to be very careful as we really have no idea what happened to her. We don't know if she was hurt. She could just be putting on a brave act. We don't know how she is feeling inside.’

Abby spoke to the media in person for the first time last week when she visited the offices of the newspaper, The Conway Daily Sun, to express her thanks for their commitment to the case.

'I'm taking it a little at a time but I'm feeling a lot better every day,' she told staff. 'I'd just like to be treated like a normal person.'

Mr Hernandez, who is president of a company called Structural Solutions, has two daughters with ex-wife Zenya, Abigail and her older sister Sarah.

Face of evil? The 34-year-old Nathaniel Kibby was arraigned last week on charges he kidnapped 15-year-old Abigail last October

He splits his time between New Hampshire and Texas, but says he is as involved in his daughters’ lives as possible.

When Abigail was missing he wrote a number of open letters on a public Facebook page in a desperate attempt to get her to come home.

The first, written in November, started: ‘We don't know if you ran away but if you did, it's important for you to know Sweetheart that nobody is angry with you, and you are not and will not be in any trouble.

I just need to know that you are OK.

‘I am very worried that you are out there in the cold, because I don't know if you have a jacket. I am also worried that you may not be eating. I am hoping and praying that you are safe, warm, and that you are eating.’

In a later note, penned six months after Abigail’s disappearance, he seemed to have changed his opinion and said he believed Abgail had run away from home. This was partly based on the fact she had sent her parents a letter soon after her disappearance. Its content has never been revealed.

Mr Hernandez offered to take custody of his daughter and wrote: ‘Abby it’s important that you understand my reason for wanting custody. Since a letter was received from you it became obvious that you ran away. And that raises the question what did you run away from? Only you can answer that but I am guessing that you ran away from your home life.’

Explaining the letters he said: ‘If you read them in full, they sum up how I feel.’ He added: ‘I don’t understand how she wrote the letter she did. I want to know.’

Since Nathaniel Kibby’s dramatic arrest on Monday and his arraignment a day later, which saw him placed on $1 million cash bail, a huge amount of scrutiny has been placed on the 34-year-old suspect.

Neighbors have described him as a gun-obsessed loner and an odd-ball, who harbored a number of conspiracy theories and regularly talked about an impending, ‘zombie apocalypse’.

He also has a lengthy criminal record, for offenses including, theft and criminal trespass, dating back to when he was just 17.

Investigation: Police searched Kibby's home but have revealed little about what led them to the accused kidnapper. Butut questions surround a shipping container on the man's Gorham, New Hampshire property, located 30 miles north of where Abigail reappeared

His trailer in Gorham, New Hampshire, about 50 minutes’ drive north of Abigail’s home town of North Conway, has been the subject of an intense search operation carried out by FBI agents, state troopers and local police officers.

They have also been scouring a storage container, kept in his back yard. It is believed he may have held Abigail captive in the container, which is thought to be sound-proofed and to have three separate rooms.

Neighbors have even suggested Kibby may have dug a tunnel to connect his trailer to the container.  

Mr Hernandez says he has no idea about who Kibby is, but he is obviously determined to find out about the man who allegedly kidnapped him beloved daughter.

He said: ‘I have never heard of Nathaniel Kibby, all I know is what I have read. But I want to know about him.’

He finished, saying: ‘I would tell every parent to keep such a close eye on their children, especially when they are teenagers. People will just have to be patient and the truth will eventually come out.’
