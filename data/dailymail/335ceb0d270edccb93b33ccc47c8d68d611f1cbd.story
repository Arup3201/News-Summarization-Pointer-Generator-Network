She claimed to have received a less than friendly welcome at her local mosque – and sparked outrage when she shared the experience on Twitter.

But new evidence appears to contradict allegations by Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman that she was ‘ushered out the door’ by Muslims during a visit.

CCTV footage was released yesterday showing that instead of being ejected from the place of worship, she left on her own.

Cathy Newman was filmed on CCTV entering the South London Islamic Centre in Streatham (left) then leaving unaccompanied (right). The journalist has apologised after telling Twitter followers she was 'ushered' off the premises

Miss Newman took to Twitter to describe the incident, telling followers she had been 'ushered into the street by a man'

It also emerged that Mrs Newman had arrived at the wrong location anyway as she attempted to take part in Visit My Mosque day.

Rather than being hurried to the door, she had simply been pointed in the right direction by Muslims and left to make her own way out.

Mrs Newman last night apologised for causing any ‘misunderstanding’ over the visit.

However, it has come a little too late for the Islamic centre at the centre of the claims, which has received a torrent of online abuse and two telephone death threats which have been reported to police.

The row started on Sunday after the TV journalist arrived at the South London Islamic Centre wearing a headscarf.

But she quickly rushed on to Twitter, claiming she had been ‘ushered’ out of the door, implying unfriendly attitudes to Western women were behind her expulsion.

The news reader was seen speaking to a man who in the mosque, and gestures towards the door at one point during the encounter. She had mistakenly arrived at the South London Islamic Centre for an event

The journalist later visited the nearby Hyderi Islamic Centre (above). Esmat Jeraj, a trustee at the centre, said she was 'disappointed' by Miss Newman's claims and that they 'fuel Islamophobia'

But it quickly emerged the mosque was one of many not taking part in the event and she was supposed to be at another location nearby where her camera crew had been waiting.

The CCTV clips revealed by The Huffington Post website show Mrs Newman entering the mosque and start to take off her shoes while having a very brief conversation with a man in the lobby.

As the primary purpose of Visit My Mosque day was to increase understanding of Islam, I was horrified to hear the Mosque I visited in error has had death threats.

"I’m sorry for any misunderstanding there has been. I would be happy to pay a private visit to South London Islamic Centre once again.”

He gestures several times to the left before she puts her shoes back on and leaves alone, walking out through the courtyard.

Apparently a little confused, she spoke to no-one else inside the premises and the entire encounter lasts no more than a few seconds.

Shortly after, she was back on the street again, and straight on to Twitter. In a series of tweets she told her 78,000 followers: ‘Well I just visited Streatham mosque for Visit My Mosque day and was surprised to find myself ushered out of the door.

‘I was respectfully dressed, head covering and no shoes, but a man ushered me back on to the street. I said I was there for Visit My Mosque. But it made no difference.’ Mrs Newman, 40, who lives in south London, was in fact due at the Hyderi Islamic Centre, where she had been invited along with a camera crew.

Miss Newman has apologised for the incident which she described as a 'misunderstanding'

She made her way to meet her colleagues there and tweeted that she had received a ‘wonderful warm welcome’ by contrast. Followers took Mrs Newman at her word, and there was even an apology from the South London Islamic Centre, which feared someone might have been rude to the TV presenter.

But yesterday mosque spokesman Aslam Ijaz said the video showed Mrs Newman had not been ushered out and appeared to be confused.

He said she spoke to a man who did not understand her properly and is thought to have assumed she was seeking the neighbouring church, which he pointed towards.

Mr Ijaz said: ‘I was really surprised that she would say she was ushered out of the mosque. Now there’s this impression we don’t like women. She said something that was not correct.’

Thanks to her ill-informed Tweets, he said, the mosque had received its first threats since opening in 1978. Mr Ijaz said he had made several efforts to contact Mrs Newman to discuss her claims, but had received no response. He pleaded for ‘the truth’ to be told to ensure his mosque was ‘not made a target’.

Mrs Newman said last night: ‘As the primary purpose of Visit My Mosque day was to increase understanding of Islam, I was horrified to hear the mosque I visited in error has had death threats.

‘I’m sorry for any misunderstanding there has been. I would be happy to pay a private visit to South London Islamic Centre once again.’
