Some people say being addicted to sex isn't a real addiction.

Indeed, many may welcome the constant craving by a partner with plenty of stamina.

But one woman has revealed the toll her continuous urge to copulate has taken on her life and says managing her condition is a constant juggling act.

One woman has anonymously confessed that she is addicted to sex and that managing her condition is a constant juggling act

In an anonymous confession to Australia's Gold Coast Bulletin the woman reveals: 'I once had sex with two guys in one night before going to meet up with the guy I was supposed to be seeing at the time. 

'This all got a little messy when at one stage I was seeing three men by the same name, in the same week.'

Sex addiction is described by the relationship counselling service Relate as any sexual activity that feels out of control.

Yet some scientists argue there's no such thing as a clinical addiction to sex and 'sufferers' are simply making excuses for their lack of self-restraint.

The woman confesses: 'I'd meet up with men just to have sex. They wouldn't even have to take me to dinner first. You don't want to get too full before a bedroom romp, after all.'

Celebrities linked to the controversial condition include Russell Brand, Michael Douglas and Tiger Woods, who are all reported to have sought professional treatment.

'It's not so bad when you're in a monogamous relationship because you always have someone to get your fix with,' the woman writes.

'You don't have to worry about catching anything because of your addiction.'

She comments that if she had the time she'd sneak off to the bathrooms to alleviate her urges and says there are little 'key-ring vibrators' that can be used in an emergency. 

She also mentions the guilt and shame she feels and how men are meant to be the ones obsessed with sex rather than women.

Michael Douglas was widely reported to have a sex addiction when he was admitted to rehab in 1990. The Hollywood actor finally admitted the claims in his 2012 biography.

American actor David Duchovny admitted to having a sex addiction and checked into rehab for treatment in August 2008.

Tiger Woods reportedly checked into a clinic for sex addiction treatment following the breakdown of his marriage in 2009.

In his memoir My Booky Wook Russell Brand admitted to suffering from an addiction to heroin and sex, and booked into rehab to treat his addiction to ‘carnal overindulgences’.

In her 2007 confessional documentary for Channel 4 entitled Am I A Sex Addict? Ulrika Jonsson questioned her own sexual behaviour and what makes a sex addict.
