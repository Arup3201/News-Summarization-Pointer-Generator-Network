A paedophile is facing jail after his 
victim spotted him on TV 30 years later - carrying the Olympic torch in 
the London 2012 relay.

Married Graham Cooper, 69, a butcher, was a regular churchgoer and a respected member of the community.

His charity work saw him nominated by his wife of forty years, Sylvia, 62, to participate in the Olympic torch relay in July last year.

Cooper appeared on television carrying the Olympic flame aloft but his greatest moment would prove to be his downfall

Cooper even appeared on television carrying the flame in his home town of Aldington, Kent.

But one viewer recognised him as the man who put her through years of serious sexual abuse as a child.

The victim’s previous complaints had fallen on deaf ears but after seeing her Cooper in the rally she contacted police again.

Officers brought Cooper in for questioning and he admitted three of his crimes.

He was convicted of further charges by a jury at Canterbury Crown Court on October 25.

Warning Cooper he will face prison, Judge Adele Williams said ‘The ordering of reports should not be taken as any indication that I am looking at anything other than an immediate prison sentence.’

His victim cannot be named for legal reasons but took to the witness stand to tell the court she lived in fear of ‘bumping into’ Cooper.

The woman wept while giving evidence and revealed she sought counseling and hypnotherapy to cope with her ordeal.

She said ‘I was thinking how could this happen? I looked things up on the internet. How could this person be chosen?

‘This man abused me. I read on the internet about him and why he was nominated, his charity work, singing in a local choir, raising money for local projects.

‘It said he was always cheerful. I read about him over and over again, about him going to the church and thought is he going there to repent or what?

Cooper claimed during his five-day trial that his young victim initiated sexual contact.

But he added ‘I feel very sorry. I am shameful. It shouldn’t have happened.

‘I have regretted it for 30 years.’

He admitted two counts of indecent assault on a female under 14 and one count of gross indecency with a female aged under 14.

The jury also found him guilty of indecent assault.

He was cleared of two further allegations of indecent assault on a female under 14 and found not guilty of the rape of a girl under the age of 16.

Cooper was released on bail for sentencing on a date to be fixed later next month.
