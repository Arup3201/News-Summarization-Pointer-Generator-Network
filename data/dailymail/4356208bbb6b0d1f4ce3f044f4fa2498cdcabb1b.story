Neil Robertson and Stephen Maguire reached the quarter-finals of the Masters after opening their Alexandra Palace campaigns with 6-4 victories.

Maguire saw off Judd Trump in the afternoon session and will take on Shaun Murphy in the last eight.

In the evening, Robertson produced a strong finish to overcome the challenge of Robert Milkins and now awaits the winner of Tuesday evening's clash between Barry Hawkins and Ali Carter.

Neil Robertson beat Robert Milkins 6-4 on Tuesday and he too will advances to the Masters quarter-finals

Milkins' Masters debut last season ended quickly with a 6-1 defeat to Ronnie O'Sullivan and he was determined to produce an improved showing, taking the opening frame with a 94 break.

He made several mistakes in the second to allow Robertson to level with a run of 60 and the world number one won a messy third frame but Milkins cleared from the final red to take the next and go into the interval at 2-2.

A 69 break was enough to win Milkins the fifth frame but Robertson finally clicked into gear with 77 in the next.

The Australian was on top in the next after a 51 break but again it went down to the wire, Milkins with a good frame-winning clearance from brown to black.

Robertson, though, found another gear with 95 to level before breaks of 117 and 76 saw him across the winning line.
