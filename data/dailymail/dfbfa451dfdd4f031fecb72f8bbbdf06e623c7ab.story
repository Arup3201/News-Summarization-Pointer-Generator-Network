Alan Pardew will be in charge for Crystal Palace’s FA Cup clash with Dover Athletic on Sunday after Palace agreed compensation of £3.5million with Newcastle.

Pardew was at the club’s Beckenham HQ on Friday, starting life as Palace’s boss, and the club are set to officially announce his appointment.

Pardew is due to be in the dug-out for Sunday's visit to the non-League side.

When discussions were ongoing on Friday caretaker manager Keith Millen said: ‘They’re still talking, but there are no problems. The lawyers are finalising the contract. The paperwork is taking longer than expected.

‘Alan has held a staff meeting when he spoke about a number of things. He spoke to the players, then we had training.

‘We’re preparing for the game on Sunday and I’m sure Alan will be taking the game. He’ll be taking training on Saturday. We’re hopeful the deal will be done for Sunday.

‘We’ve spoken about the team for Sunday’s game. He’s gone through the squad. He’s learning about the players, but he’s pleased with what he’s seen. He’ll pick the team.

‘Alan is excited because it’s Crystal Palace and the club means a lot to him, but it’s also exciting because of the players he’s inheriting.’

Caretaker boss Keith Millen took charge of Palace's 0-0 draw at Aston Villa on New Year's Day

Pardew will have to give late fitness tests to Damien Delaney and James McArthur ahead of the match against Dover.

The pair picked up injuries against Aston Villa on New Year’s Day, while Mile Jedinak is on international duty with Australia.

Meanwhile, chairman Steve Parish has admitted the summer appointment of Neil Warnock was a mistake.

Warnock became manager following Tony Pulis’s shock departure just days before the start of the season.

‘In the maelstrom that was going on then, I probably wanted to get someone in too much. I felt that what we had here (when Pulis left) we could just keep going,’ said Parish.

‘Neil is a very nice guy, a really nice guy. I would have loved him to be a success.

‘Things haven’t gone so well, with Tony (Pulis) going just before the start of the season. It causes upheaval. I probably didn’t get the right fit with Neil. I’ve got to take it on the chin for that one.’
