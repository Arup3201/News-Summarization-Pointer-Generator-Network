Lewis Hamilton led a Mercedes one-two in Spanish Grand Prix practice on Friday while Red Bull's world champion Sebastian Vettel was sidelined with an electrical problem.

Race favourite Hamilton was quickest in both sessions, 0.449 of a second faster than championship leading team mate Nico Rosberg in the afternoon and 0.868 ahead of McLaren's Jenson Button in the morning.

While Hamilton pounded out the laps, ahead of a weekend that could bring him a fourth successive win, quadruple champion Vettel was little more than a spectator at the Circuit de Catalunya.

The 
German, winner of nine races in a row at the end of last season, was 
forced to park up by the side of the track early in the day with just 
four laps completed.

Circuit
 de Catalunya marshals handed him a fire extinguisher as he inspected 
the car before hitching a ride back to the paddock on a scooter.

Red
 Bull have given the 26-year-old a car built on a different chassis to 
the one he has used so far in what has been a difficult start to the 
season, but there was no obvious improvement.

'Due
 to an electrical problem that has damaged the wiring loom of Car No. 1,
 Sebastian will not be able to take part in FP2,' Red Bull said before 
the afternoon session started. 'The team will use the time to fix it to 
be ready for FP3 tomorrow.'

Time to thing: Vettel reflects on a difficult start to his Spanish Grand Prix weekend as his car is towed away

The
 last time the German was at a Spanish circuit, testing at Jerez in 
January, he spent most of his time in the garage watching mechanics work
 on the car as Renault wrestled with teething problems on the new V6 
power unit.

Hamilton,
 four points behind Rosberg after four races, went from strength to 
strength with a fastest lap of one minute 27.023 seconds set six minutes
 from the end in the morning. After lunch, his best time was a 1:25.524.

The
 impressive margins in the Spanish sunshine underlined the Briton's 
status as the man to watch in Formula One's first European race of the 
season.

Rosberg,
 who had said on Thursday he just needed a 'normal weekend' to regain 
the momentum, suffered a cooling issue that cut short his first session 
and left him fifth fastest before normal service was resumed in the 
afternoon.

Vettel's
 Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo, who has made an impressive start
 with the team, was third in both sessions with Ferrari's Fernando 
Alonso, the local favourite for his home race after winning last year, 
fourth.

With
 the opening long-haul races in Asia and the Middle East out of the way,
 all teams have brought updates to their cars and Friday's practice 
sessions were being closely watched for any signs of change in the 
pecking order.

They
 were also the first chance for many of the fans to hear the new, less 
noisy engines with engineers already looking at ways of making them 
louder.

In
 a bizarre early incident, a wing mirror on Sergio Perez's Force India 
broke off and was left flapping around on a wire. The Mexican completed 
the lap with it in his hand.
