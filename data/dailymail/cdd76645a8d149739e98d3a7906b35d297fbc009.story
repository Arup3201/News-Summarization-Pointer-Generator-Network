You would think it would be the countryside, television programmes or a traditional Sunday pub roast that British expats miss the most about their homeland.

But a new survey suggests many expats who are loving life abroad are homesick for something that their stay-at-home compatriots would probably love to escape.

Believe it or not, it’s the UK’s unpredictable weather.

Sunny days: Twenty per cent of those polled say they miss the UK's unpredictable weather

Rainy days: Britain's climate ranked higher than the NHS, food and culture in the survey

Clothing retailer Cotton Traders polled 3,500 expats about what they miss the most about Britain, and one in five admitted they still pine for its changeable climate despite living in warmer and sunnier climes.

It appears Britain’s spells of gloomy weather aren’t so bad after all, with the climate ranking higher than comfort food, popular culture and publicly-funded health care. 

Fifteen per cent of respondents said the one thing they miss the most about Britain is the National Health Service, while eight per cent said they miss the quirky sense of humour and passion for culture.

A third of those polled said they plan to come home for good at some point in the future.

Despite their nostalgia, it appears most expats are loving their time away.

A vast majority (89 per cent) said they feel that they have a better quality of life, while 77 per cent say they now have more free time than they did in the UK.

Half say they are enjoying a lower cost of living and a quarter said they were lured away by affordable housing.

Socialising was another big draw for those based overseas, with two thirds saying they felt able to socialise more.

An overwhelming 85 per cent said they had more leisure time, while almost half (49 per cent) felt their non-UK home was friendlier.

A further 15 per cent said they felt energised when abroad and 13 per cent credited an evening ‘stay up late’ culture with making it easier to mingle.

Claire Flanagan, Cotton Traders’ international marketing manager, said: ‘The expat life is a fantastic one for hundreds of thousands of Brits – not least because of the great opportunities it offers for making new friends and enjoying leisure time.

‘But at the same time, absence really does make the heart grow fonder.

‘Being away seems to make people appreciate the things that make Britain great, including our culture, food, NHS and weather.’
