Hotel room prices across Europe have fallen by 13 per cent over the last month – except in the UK, where they have increased sharply in some cities.

Italy and Spain have seen some of the biggest price cuts as the month-to-month cost of a one-night stay has dropped by an average of £13 across Europe.

Venice topped the list of bargains as the average price of a hotel room in October (£194) plunged 44 per cent to £109 for bookings in November – reflecting savings of £85.

The average price of a hotel room in Venice in November is nearly half of what it was in October

Savings: The month-to-month cost of a one-night stay has dropped by an average of £13 across Europe

It was followed by Florence, where visitors to the Tuscan capital are paying 32 per cent less (£131 in October to £89 in November).

Rome was third on the list, followed by Barcelona and Prague. Lisbon, Paris, Athens, Seville and Bilbao rounded out the top ten. 

The study by hotel price comparison website Trivago analysed prices in 50 cities and found that prices have dropped an average of 13 per cent across the continent.

One night in a standard double room in November will cost an average of £86 compared to £99 in October.

Hotel prices across Europe have decreased compared to this time last year with the biggest savings found in Paris, Rome and Barcelona, where prices are down by eight per cent. 

Prices in the UK, meanwhile, haven't budged in the last month and they are six per cent higher than they were a year ago, Trivago said.

In Florence, visitors are paying 32 per cent less for a hotel room (£131 in October to £89 in November)

Rome was third on the list as the price of a standard double room dropped from £126 to £86

Prague rounded out the top ten as the price of a hotel room dropped by 26 per cent

From November 2013 to November 2014:

According to the study, Norwich had the largest year-over-year spike as the average cost of a one-night stay increased by £18 to £110 (20 per cent).

Leeds had the second largest increase with guests spending £14 more per night than a year ago.

Trivago spokeswoman Denise Bartlett said: 'This November might be the best month to visit Italian cities such as Rome, Venice and Florence – temperatures are much milder than the UK, crowds are less and hotel prices are significantly cheaper.

'The same can be said for Barcelona, Lisbon, Athens, Seville and Bilbao. Paris is also worth mentioning – typically it is one of the most expensive European cities, but this month visitors can save an average of £41 in comparison to last month.

'UK travellers might find their money goes further abroad this winter.'
