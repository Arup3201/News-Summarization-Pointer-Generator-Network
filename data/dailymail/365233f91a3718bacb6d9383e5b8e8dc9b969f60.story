Poignant: Former chief executive of the Arts Council in Wales Frances Medley wrote a blog explaining why she ended her own life after eight years suffering from multiple sclerosis

A leading figure in the art world asked friends to post a poignant blog entry explaining why she had chosen to end her own life after suffering from multiple sclerosis for almost a decade.

Frances Medley, a former chief executive of the Arts Council of Wales, wrote the post, entitled A Sophisticated Sign Off, in the days before her death at the age of 44 on September 18.

The emotional post, published on Ms Medley's Victorious Endeavours blog, read: 'The prospect of further rapid deterioration was both terrifying and not one I wanted to entertain.

'I decided to end my life in a manner and at a time of my choosing.

Ms Medley added: 'I am very clear that, whilst the law might say otherwise, I AM NOT COMMITTING SUICIDE.'

In the blog, Ms Medley describes how MS saw her decline from being a 'higher rate taxpayer responsible for running a public body' to not earning enough money to be eligible to pay any tax.

She was diagnosed with the degenerative condition in 2005.

She wrote: 'The loss of my independence both financially and physically has been extremely difficult for me.

'Without the financial support of my immediate family, I would have had to seek the support of the State.

'Whilst of course I was entitled to resort to this I found the prospect humiliating.

'Pride is a terrible thing, a real burden at times of need.'

In the post, Ms Medley speaks of having 'peaked early on in life'.

She said: 'I don’t leave with rafts of regrets or things I wish I’d done. Happy with my lot is perhaps an exaggeration but had the Spinster persisted my ability to do things would have been daily reduced; my potential it seems has been fulfilled.

Signing off: Frances Medley asked her friends to post the blog on her Victorious Endeavours feed

'The values by which the Spinster has conducted her life are: clarity, integrity and wisdom with curiosity and creativity added in for Victorious Endeavours.'

She added: 'Live life as though it could be snatched away from you in a heartbeat; take managed risks avoiding recklessness; and treat your fellow travellers with tenderness and care.

'Hold your tongue at times when you risk blurting out judgemental potentially hurtful comments; we seldom know the full back story.'

Wishing her followers 'good luck', Ms Medley concluded: 'The Spinster signs off with sophistication.'

'Live life as though it could be snatched

Frances Medley

Following her spell as chief executive of the Arts Council, Ms Medley, from Barry, South Wales, became a freelance business consultant for the creative sector and became involved in the National Youth Arts Wales Steering Group as well as the Magdalena Project - a scheme that supports women in theatre and the arts.

Her mother Sue Medley confirmed that her daughter had left informal instructions to her friends to publish the blog post after her death.

Ms Medley's post saw several of her followers leave replies paying tribute to her.

One read: 'For me Fran was mentor, champion, confidante and friend and she had the ability to make me blush with her flirtatious comments and cheeky looks.

'I was devasted to hear the news. Shocked but not surprised. She chose her own journey and I celebrate her sophistication and dignity. I feel blessed for having known her.'

Inspirational: Friends and former colleagues led the tributes to Ms Medley

Another added: 'Frances, you are one of the most hardworking individuals that I know of. Your energy, passion and drive made a huge impact on the Arts in wales. The candle that burns twice as bright…'

Friends and colleagues of the academic have also paid tribute to her.

Gilly Adams said: 'I am so moved by Fran’s courage. It was incredibly important to her to stress the distinction between committing suicide and choosing to end her life.'

Professor Dai Smith, chairman of the Arts Council of Wales, said: 'She was a woman who contributed greatly towards the arts in Wales and conducted her work with considerable strength and dedication. She will be sorely missed.'

Ms Medley was originally from Derbyshire and studied at the University of Aberyswyth and Washington State University.

Before she was appointed acting chief executive of the Arts Council of Wales, she was the organisation's Planning Director and oversaw planning for the group's £38million budget.

Before joining the ACW, she worked as a senior executive officer in the Local Government Finance division at the National Assembly.

An inquest has been opened and a funeral service will be held next week.

'Well dear readers the Spinster has decided to call it a day; Cruella has simply exhausted me emotionally and physically.

'The prospect of further rapid deterioration was both terrifying and not one I wanted to entertain.

'The Spinster decided to end her life in a manner and at a time of my choosing; I am very clear that, whilst the law might say otherwise, I AM NOT COMMITTING SUICIDE.

'It has been just over 8 years since the Spinster was given the unwelcome gift of a chronic incurable degenerative disease; one that would destroy my life slowly at first and then in leaps and bounds.

'In just over 10 years this Spinster went from being a higher rate tax payer responsible for running a public body – (as an aside I believe I was the youngest woman to do this at the age of 30) – to a position last year where I didn’t earn enough to pay tax.

'The loss of my independence both financially and physically has been extremely difficult for me.

'Without the financial support of my immediate family I would have had to seek the support of the State; whilst of course I was entitled to resort to this I found the prospect humiliating. 

'Pride is a terrible thing; a real burden at times of need.

'The Spinster fortunately peaked early on life and so I don’t leave with rafts of regrets or things I wish I’d done.

'Happy with my lot is perhaps an exaggeration but had the Spinster persisted my ability to do things would have been daily reduced; my potential it seems has been fulfilled.

'The values by which the Spinster has conducted her life are: clarity, integrity and wisdom with curiosity and creativity added in for Victorious Endeavours.

'These principles have served the Spinster well as I leaving this mortal coil with a clear conscience albeit with a limited bank balance! Integrity is not a road paved with gold!!'So live life as though it could be snatched away from you in a heartbeat; take managed risks avoiding recklessness; and treat your fellow travellers with tenderness and care.

'Hold your tongue at times when you risk blurting out judgemental potentially hurtful comments; we seldom know the full back story.'Good bye and good luck ladies (and fellow male travellers too).'The Spinster signs off with sophistication.'
