A former chief pilot of Concorde is selling £100,000 worth of his aviation memorabilia so he can fund his 20-year-old daughter through flying school.

Mike Bannister is selling a host of memorabilia including cockpit instruments, a damaged blade, a prototype tyre and the sought-after Pitot Probe, which sat on the front of the nosecone and defined the Concorde’s shape.

The 65-year-old said he didn’t want his daughter Amy to be burdened with debt at the start of her career and will use his profit to help repay her six-figure loan which she took out to fund training as a commercial airline pilot at a flight training school in Spain.

Another item up for sale is the Concorde oil pressure gauge which was located on the flight engineer's panel

Mike Bannister, 65, from Staines, Middlesex, first flew Concorde as a co-pilot in 1977 before becoming chief pilot in 1995. He went on to fly the last ever Concorde flight in 2003 when the aircraft was officially retired

One item being sold is Mr Bannister’s retirement present - the long Pitot Probe on the front of the nose cone that defined the aircraft’s shape. The device, that actually measured Concorde’s speed, is valued at 10,000 pounds.

Also being sold is Concorde’s crucial Centre of Gravity Controller which helped move fuel around the jet to balance it so that aircraft drag could be minimised, thus giving it the ability to fly at speeds of 1,500mph. It is worth £8,500.

A £4,000 damaged blade removed from one of Concorde’s engines that had to be shut down when it ingested a foreign body is also being sold.

However, one of the most significant items up for sale is a piece of the prototype tyre that Mr Bannister took to meetings with safety authorities in the wake of the 2000 Air France Concorde crash.

He said: ‘When I retired from British Airways in 2004 I was very grateful to be given a number of items of Concorde equipment as a thank you.

‘I have also acquired other items from various sales over the years.

A damaged Concorde blade, prototype tyre and a signed Golden Jubilee flypast formation guide are also going under the hammer at the online auction on July 25, as well as several signed photos and documents (above)

Another item being put up for auction by Mike Bannister is a prototype tyre (above), which was introduced after the fatal Air France crash in Paris in July 2000 which killed a total of 113 people

‘I was very lucky when I trained to be
 a pilot as it was sponsored by the airline. But times have changed and 
if you want to be a commercial pilot now somebody has to pay £100,000 
and at the end of the day the student is left with the debt at the start
 of their career.

‘I was sat in my study one day and it struck me that I have been very fortunate to have had a fabulous career and I was looking at these items around me and thought about selling them to take that debt burden off of Amy.

‘It is a natural circle of life that the money raised will go back in to flying in the form of helping my daughter to be a commercial pilot.

‘When she last came home from Spain I told her what I was going to do and she was very pleased.

‘It has been over 10 years since Concorde last flew and you would have thought interest in it would have waned but it hasn’t.

‘If anything the interest is going back up because there is now a new generation of people who were too young to remember it fly but who are now really fascinated by it.’

Mr Bannister will use his profit to help repay his daughter's six-figure loan which she took out to fund training as a commercial airline pilot at a flight training school in Spain. Pictured: A Concorde engine blade to be sold

Mr Bannister, from Staines, Middlesex, first flew Concorde as a co-pilot in 1977 and then became chief pilot in 1995.

He flew the last ever Concorde flight in 2003 when the aircraft was retired due to the general downturn in the aviation industry and following the Air France crash of July 2000 in which 113 people died.

In the wake of the tragedy in Paris, Mike played a vital role in making safety improvements to Concorde so it could fly again.

He said: ‘On the day of the crash my wife Christine and Amy, who was aged six, were about to board the QEII to go on a cruise to New York.

‘My pager went off and I had to go to Heathrow and take up a role in the emergency centre. I went home again 48 hours later to Amy.’

Other items being sold at the auction include a signed copy of the formation flypast technical programme for the flypast over Buckingham Palace of Concorde and the Red Arrows to mark the Queen’s Golden Jubilee in 2002.

Mark Jennings, of auctioneers Chaucer Collectables of Folkestone, Kent, said: ‘The iconic status of Concorde has always ensured memorabilia has remained popular but you can’t get much better than sourcing it from the chief pilot himself.

‘We are expecting considerable interest in the sale.

‘This is the first time we have been able to offer such an impressive range of artifacts. Not only are they scarce but they were essential pieces of Concorde operation.’

The items will go on display at Cobham Services on the M25 on July 24 before the auction takes place online on July 25.
