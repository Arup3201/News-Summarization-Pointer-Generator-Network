Delta Sigma Phi's Gamma Alpha chapter is now closed and will remain that way for at least two years, San Diego State University said Tuesday.

The fraternity's 'consistent pattern of policy violations that includes the harassment of a Take Back the Night March on Friday, November 21, 2014, as well as other significant hazing and alcohol misconduct issues' was the reason behind the move, the university said in a release.

Delta Sigma Phi's members brandished dildos at Take Back the Night demonstrators, student newspaper The Daily Aztec reported.

Take Back the Night, whose events are frequently held on college campuses, says on its website 'We seek to end sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual abuse and all other forms of sexual violence.'

Behavior: Delta Sigma Phi members at San Diego State University reportedly brandished dildos at Take Back the Night demonstrators last month during an event

'Delta Sigma Phi and SDSU have agreed that the earliest date for recolonization would be fall 2016. The return date is subject to a review of demonstrated adherence to university policies,' SDSU said in the release.

The fraternity's national office said in a statement that 'It recently became clear that certain members of Gamma Alpha Chapter have not maintained the integrity that our members deserve and that our history demands. A series of incidents highlighted behavior inconsistent with the high standards that have been synonymous with the Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity at San Diego State University.'

It continued, 'After learning of widespread member misconduct issues, the National Fraternity determined it was not in the best interest of Delta Sigma Phi to continue operating Gamma Alpha Chapter. The Fraternity cannot, and will not, tolerate blatant disregard toward our policies and standards for members and chapters.'

SDSU said in its release that the 'individuals involved in the harassment policy violation will be subject to a Title IX policy investigation and a student code of conduct policy violation investigation.'

Plan: SDSU announced Monday an education plan for fraternities and sororities, which included an online course and a Walk a Mile in Her Shoes event scheduled for the spring semester

In an email exchange with MailOnline, university spokesman Greg Block emphasized that 'Delta Sigma Phi was not closed on our campus because of [the Take Back the Night event]. That incident was the last in a string of policy violations that led the Delta Sigma Phi national office to close the chapter here at San Diego State.'

The Daily Aztec reported earlier this month that both Delta Sigma Phi and Sigma Phi Epsilon were interviewed by Student Life and Leadership over the Take Back the Night event, with plans to interview the demonstrators.

Block told The Daily Aztec on Tuesday that an investigation continues into allegations that Sigma Phi Epsilon members hollered obscenities at Take Back the Night demonstrators. 

Concerned Students of San Diego State University alleged in a statement that 'Specifically, on Hardy Avenue, men at the SIGMA PHI EPSILON fraternity house yelled obscenities at the marchers.' 

Last week, Sigma Phi Epsilon's chapter president Austin Dean told The College Fix that the demonstrators shouted obscenities at multiple fraternities. 

'When they arrived at our campus facility and began yelling, a single member of our chapter shouted for them to go home,' he told the website.

'We are continuing to investigate whether anything that was said by this student was inappropriate, but have been unable to substantiate this claim,' Dean also said.

The Daily Aztec reported that 'The InterFraternity Council suspended social activities on [November] 25 following the allegations from demonstrators in an effort to educate its members about sexual assault.'

SDSU announced Monday an education plan for fraternities and sororities, which included an online course and a Walk a Mile in Her Shoes event scheduled for the spring semester.
