The North East is the fastest growing region in the country in a sign the economic recovery is spreading, figures show today.

Lloyds Bank said its index of activity among UK companies – where anything above 50 represents growth – dipped from 59 to a still robust 58 in June.

Companies in the North East of England saw the strongest expansion last month, with the region clocking up a record score of 64.8.

It was followed by the South West at 59.4, the East at 58.9, and London and the East Midlands at 58.4.

The West Midlands was the weakest of the English regions, at a still positive 57.6, while Wales scored 59.3 and Scotland 55.9.

The report undermines claims by Labour that the recovery is benefiting only a minority in London and the South East.

Tim Hinton, managing director for small and medium sized businesses at Lloyds, said the ‘robust’ performance in June ‘rounds off a strong second quarter for both manufacturing and services companies’.

He said: ‘Efforts to boost capacity and investment spending indicate that businesses are increasingly confident that economic conditions will continue to improve in the second half of the year.’

The report shows jobs are being created in England at the fastest rate since records began in 2001.

Although job creation was strongest in London, companies in the East, the South East, Yorkshire and Humber and the West Midlands reported the strongest rise in staff numbers for over 13 years in June.

The figures will be welcomed by ministers as the government attempts to boost output in all regions of the country and restore prosperity to the great northern industrial heartlands.

Ed Miliband recently said that the economic recovery is chiefly benefiting London and claimed four in five jobs created since 2010 were in the capital.

But the Labour leader was left red-faced when it emerged that the figures were out of date, with the most recent statistics showing just a quarter of new jobs were created in London since 2010 and just a fifth over the past year.

A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘The truth is that with the economy growing again we are now seeing record numbers of people getting jobs thanks to the government’s long-term economic plan.

‘Unemployment has just seen the biggest annual fall in 16 years and the unemployment rate is at a new five year low.

‘There is still more to do, but it should be welcomed that more people are in work than ever before and thousands of people are getting jobs every single day.’
