A splash of colour in an otherwise dreary hospital ward can brighten up even the most difficult of days.

But according to a survey, nine out of ten NHS hospitals do not allow patients to have fresh flowers by their bed – despite three out of four people opposing a ban.

Increasing numbers of hospitals have introduced the rules to address concerns about spreading germs, aggravating allergies and creating extra work for nurses.

However the poll of 3,700 Britons discovered that around 90 per cent said flowers can dramatically improve someone’s mood when they are unwell, and almost half thought they would speed up recovery. Just over three-quarters of people surveyed disagreed with banning the gifts.

There is no official ruling from the Department of Health on whether flowers should be allowed in wards.

However the poll, carried out by craft supplier Country Baskets, contacted 105 hospitals – and found there was a fresh flower ban in 97 of them, with others discouraging visitors from bringing bouquets.

Country Baskets spokesman Venessa Hodgson said: ‘We appreciate the concerns around taking flowers on to wards. But there are real, proven benefits to giving flowers to people who are unwell.’

Psychologist Emma Kenny added: 'There are many studies that show the psychological impact that flowers can have on a person's recovery or general well-being.

'In a hospital environment it is vital that patients are kept feeling as upbeat and positive as possible.'

Country Baskets has now launched the 'Power of the Flower' campaign with Britain's first artificial flower vending machine in St James's Hospital in Leeds.
