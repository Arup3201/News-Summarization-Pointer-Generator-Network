19 Kids and Counting star Michelle Duggar has revealed that she sticks to a $5 per person daily food budget in her bustling 20-person household.

The 47-year-old, who has nine daughters and ten sons ranging from three to 26 years old with her husband Jim Bob, 48, writes in her blog for TLC that she spends an average of $3,000 a month on groceries.

On her family's website she details some of the money-saving meals she likes to rustle up including Broccoli Casserole, Poor Man's Pizza and Three Bean Chilli.

To save on shopping, Mrs Duggar says she shops for ingredients at discount stores, warehouse clubs and co-ops.

She mainly buys in bulk, stocking up once a month on staples including butter, cereal and oats.

She will return every three to four days to purchase fresh produce.

'You can save thousands of dollars by doing just that,' the devout Christian matriarch notes.

Although she maintains a close rein on the purse strings, Mrs Duggar says she used to be much stricter.

Just a year ago she was spending around $2,000 every month on food.

However, higher food prices meant she had to up her spending. Growing children were another factor.

She humorously writes: 'Our boys have grown a lot and they have hollow legs. Josiah, Jedidiah, Jeremiah, and Jason are all tall and lanky.

'I jokingly say every two hours we have to fill up those hollow legs to make them grow a few more inches.'

When there are family get-togethers there are even more mouths to feed as Mr and Mrs Duggar also have three grandchildren, from their eldest son, Joshua, 26, who married Anna in September 2008 and moved out of home.

Thanks to keeping a close eye on their finances the Duggars -  who will mark their 30th wedding anniversary this July - pride themselves on living debt free.

Along with watching what they eat, the couple shop for clothes at thrift stores, scour Craigslist for furniture, and have never brought a new car.

Mrs Duggar concludes: 'I'm willing to wait for a little bit to buy things we need. We've already decided we won't go into debt to buy things.

'If our couch wears out, I know I've got $65 to spend on a couch and we’ll look around.

'In the meantime, if our couch falls apart, we'll take it out and just sit on the carpet for a while. It's no big deal. I don’t feel like I need to meet the status quo.'

The Duggars first entered the spotlight in 2008 on TLC's show 17 and Counting - a series which followed the life of Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17 - now 19 - children.

The family is conservative Christian and has strong beliefs about issues such as contraception, home-schooling, and spending very little time on the internet or watching TV.

They are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement which 'teaches that children are God’s blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given.'

Addressing their critics, Mr Duggar once said: 'People think we are overpopulating the world [but] we are following our convictions.'

He and his wife announced last year that they were actively trying for another child before their 50th birthdays.
