Two in three parents are putting their children's lives at risk by strapping them in to wrongly fitted car seats. 

And that has soared by more than a third in just five years - putting up to seven out of ten youngsters in danger.  

The figures come just days after the Department for Transport  revealed the number of children killed or seriously injured on Britain's roads has risen for the first time in two decades. 

The number of youngsters killed or seriously injured rose by 3 per cent to 2,060 in the year to September 2014, official statistics revealed.

It also coincides with government measures for a new safer child-seat system - based on a child's height rather than their age - which is now going through parliament. 

Details are revealed in a new report into car-seat safety problems by road safety campaign group Good Egg, which has tested 20,500 child safety seats in England, Wales and Scotland since 2002.

It found 71 per cent of seats tested last year in England and Wales and 64 per cent in Scotland did not meet minimum fitting standards. 

This was a significant increase from 47 per cent in 2010 and the average of 57 per cent the last five years.  

Online purchases and second-hand seats have also contributed to the rise in incorrect fitting.  

A Which? survey last year revealed nine out of ten shops – including major high street names – made 'potentially lethal mistakes' when showing parents how to install their child and baby car seats properly.

Jan James, chief executive of Good Egg Safety said: 'Two thirds of the children and babies in Britain are now at risk as a result of the seat being improperly fitted, incorrect for the size and weight of the child, or wrong for the make and model of vehicle.' 

She added: 'The saddest thing is most parents and grandparent genuinely want what is best for their children, they just don't know how to choose the right seats nor how to fit them.'

The safety group says parents who buy a child seat in a shop should insist a trained sales assistant helps fit the seat, and parents should specify their child's height and weight and the car's model before buying. 

Its report says: 'If the seat arrives without clear instructions for fitting and testing, then send it back.

'If you're offered a second hand seat, just politely decline. There is very little chance that a second hand seat will be right for your car and your child. You wouldn't entrust your child with a stranger yet that's exactly what you are doing if you place them in a seat without knowing its history'.

However tempting the price may be, road safety officers advise against buying second hand child car seats – most only have a life span of about five years, and if they have ever been involved in an accident they might not offer full protection. 

Even if you want a bargain, you should buy new.

Transport minister Robert Goodwill said: 'We are in the process of signing a new child seat specification. 

'It gives a higher degree of protection and new standards that go on the height of a child, not the age.'

Ministers say that moving to a system based on the child's height – rather than age - will make it much easier for parents to choose and fit the correct seat.

Legislation currently going through Parliament will allow a new and safer standard of child seat - known as 'i-size' – to be used alongside existing ones in Britain. 

It will require a child to travel in a rearward position until the age of 15 months, provide side impact protection for better protection of the head and neck, and involve a more rigorous testing procedure for new designs, including an improved crash test dummy.  

Ben Willshire, group manager at the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) in Berkshire said it was developing a new 'star rating' system which will help consumers make an informed choice when buying a child seat and will include an assessment of the usability of the seat.
