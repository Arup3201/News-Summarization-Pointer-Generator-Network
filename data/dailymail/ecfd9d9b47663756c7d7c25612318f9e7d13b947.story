A scuba diver who found a wedding ring on the sea bed while on holiday in Mexico has launched a Facebook campaign to reunite it with its owner.

Daniel Roark from Gloucester, Massachusetts had been diving off the coast of Playa del Carmen, earlier this year when he came across the gold ring.

He believes it must be a wedding band and it is engraved with the name Jessica on the inside, with the date of 16 02 13 and the letters TYYJCEM.

Daniel Roark, who was scuba diving off the coast of Playa del Carmen in Mexico earlier this year when he found a wedding ring on the sea bed 

The gold wedding band has the name Jessica engraved inside it along with the date of 16/02/13 and the letters TYYJCEM

Thinking it could be a meaningful piece of jewellery, he has started a campaign on social media to track the owner.

And now the appeal has gone viral with his post on Facebook being shared almost 120,000 times, creating the hashtag #thelostweddingband.

Writing on Facebook with a picture of the ring, he explained: 'Ok, so while scuba diving around Playa Reef, Playa Del Carmen last week, I happened to find this ring.

'Unfortunately there is no way for me to know whether it was lost or intentionally thrown into the ocean.

'Assuming it was not the latter, I'd like to find the owner so I can send it to them.

Mr Roark is desperate to reunite the ring with its owner but despite his high-profile campaign, nobody has yet come forward 

Mr Roark had been scuba diving while staying at Playa Reef in the Mexican resort, pictured, when he came across the ring 

'If you know a couple who was married on February 16th, 2013, who lost a wedding band (likely while diving) near Playa Del Carmen Mexico, please have them contact me at thelostweddingband@yahoo.com.

'If not, please take a second to share this. Let's make some social media magic happen!'

But despite the high-profile campaign, the owner has yet to come forward and Mr Roark is keen to find the owners soon.

In another post he added: 'I'm shocked at how much support the search for the wedding band owner has received!

'Sadly the owner has not been found yet, but my hope for humanity was certainly restored!

'Always remember, even in this crazy world, there are a lot of kind people.'
