Anyone who knows Roy Hodgson will tell you that  England’s head coach is a lovely guy. Charming fella, brilliant  company, great stories.

Frankly, that doesn’t make you the man to remain in the most prestigious football job in this country.  This is a resignation issue.

England are as good as out of a World Cup after two group games. It is a modern-day football scandal. We thought that wretched 4-1 defeat against Germany in Bloemfontein four years ago was bad. Somehow, this was even worse.

This defeat, with Luis Suarez allowed to trample all over England’s defence, hurts more than any other because we could all see it coming.

Don’t allow anyone from the FA, the England team or the management to brainwash you in the coming days about this squad being in development and everything going according to plan. Poppycock.

Next stop is Russia and after that Qatar, where FA chairman Greg Dyke has set the national team the target of winning the tournament.  Not going to happen out there, Greg.

How about we set out to win the tournament at hand with the country’s best players available playing in the best positions and worry about the big picture another time?

Wayne Rooney told us that this was the best England team he has ever been involved with and we’re meant to keep a straight face.

Flashback: England's 4-1 defeat by Germany in 2010 was an all-time low at a World Cup

Everybody knows that five-year plans, master plans and FA inquiries keep people who shouldn’t be in high profile positions in high profile positions. This effort really is shameful.  We have been looking forward to a World Cup in Brazil for an entire lifetime and the chances are that we will never be back here again before we meet our  makers. Think about that for a moment.

With the exception of holding the tournament in England, playing the World Cup here is as close as it gets to footballing utopia.  Instead, after our final group game against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte next week, the chances are that the squad will be on the first flight out of here.

It is incredible to think that captain Steven Gerrard and Hodgson told us that there were no special plans in place to stop one of the world’s leading strikers. Is this for real? Were they being serious? It cannot be so. Say it ain’t so.

Every man jack around this camp over the past few days knew how much it would mean for Suarez to  bully  England out of the tournament. Well he has just done it.

England’s defence was embarrassing, unable to cope at the elite level against Italy and now Uruguay.  Until we understand what it means for the South Americans to slip on that jersey and belt out the national anthems we will never stand a chance on this continent and  neither will our coach.

You can bang on about technique and tactics as much as you like, but you have to understand that these South American kids are off the streets. They play from the heart. It is different for them, it really is.

Beating England is better than anything, just talk to them for a few minutes and you understand that and be wowed by it.

Did we really think England could turn up in Sao Paulo, where Uruguay forward Nicolas Lodeiro plays his club football with Corinthians, and get away with it? Not on your life.

Great debate: The decision on where to play Wayne Rooney, if at all, gave Hodgson a big headache

Like most managers at the highest level, Hodgson cracked at the crucial moment in the build-up to the World Cup. It gets to them all.

Four years ago his predecessor Fabio Capello lost the plot when he attempted to bring Paul Scholes out of international retirement and messed about with the England captaincy. By the time the Capello Index was unveiled on the eve of the tournament in South Africa, team spirit had been blown to bits.

Euro 2012, when Hodgson was parachuted in to replace Capello, was meant to be the head coach’s free pass in his first tournament.

We would judge him at the World Cup — and let’s not start rewriting history with some baloney about the young players benefiting from tournament experience.  Whatever you make of England and these two defeats here, please don’t buy that argument.

Hodgson got carried away with the idea that a young team could cope with tournament conditions in a difficult, but beautiful, country.

To the future: Raheem Sterling is one of a number of young players England possess

Perhaps he believed, when  England drew 2-2 in the Maracana last June against Brazil, that his defence would be good enough at the World Cup.  He called that wrong because Glen Johnson, Gary Cahill, Phil Jagielka and Leighton Baines were in the team that afternoon.

Surely Hodgson, with all his experience at international level, would know other teams don’t take friendlies anywhere near as seriously as we do. A 2-2 draw for Brazil is chicken feed compared to when the World Cup comes around. When it does, the top players — Neymar, Balotelli, Pirlo and Suarez — come alive. That is why they are in the elite bracket.

Over the coming days there will be many mea culpas and lots of people from the FA pretending that all is well with the world.

Well actually, no it’s not.
