Premier League tickets are not just the most expensive in the world in absolute terms - at £28.80 on average for a ‘cheap’ adult seat - but take up a larger chunk of the average fan’s wages than virtually any league globally.

An exclusive Mail on Sunday study of the world’s football leagues reveals fans in only two countries, Brazil and China, need spend a bigger portion of their weekly income to watch top-flight-football. And they are only dearer than the Premier League by a whisker.

Our analysis considers the average price of a ‘typical’ top-flight ticket in 34 countries and weighs it against local income. Using the most recent data, the study shows a supporter in England could buy just 14.3 tickets with a week’s pay (£411).

In Brazil the average seat costs £12.73, or 14.2 tickets for a week’s pay, and in China the income is £140 and the average seat, according to a spokesman, is £10, or just 14 tickets.

Statistics on these pages and available in full online show the extraordinary range of prices that fans pay around the world - and indicate where the beautiful game truly remains the people’s game.

The cheapest tickets when weighted to income are in Algeria, where a £1.40 seat means the average fan could buy as many as 118 tickets with a week’s pay. Prices in Nigeria, Ukraine, Poland, Chile, South Africa and Sweden are also among the most affordable.

Germany’s Bundesliga is often lauded as a bargain - but 22 countries offer better value against local wages. A typical Bundesliga seat costs £19.17, meaning a fan there can buy 27 tickets with a week’s pay.

Ticket prices vary enormously within each country and even at each club. Our average (or ‘typical’) seat prices are either the official figure provided by each league or an average price for the cheapest available adult non-concessionary tickets from a selection of clubs in each league.

‘Ticket pricing, especially at the top clubs, is the standout factor in order of magnitude among fans’ concerns,’ says Malcolm Clarke of the Footballer Supporters’ Federation.

‘This is a league with money coming out of its ears, so rich from TV deals that the clubs could give every seat away for nothing and still have more money now than they did before the current TV deal.

‘That clubs have failed to make an impact in this area is scandalous.’

While the Premier League is the most expensive to watch live, it clearly has positives that make it hugely popular at home and abroad. The Mail on Sunday’s groundbreaking in-depth study of world leagues has analysed a wide range of factors from all 34, from income and wages, to ‘star’ quality and goals, attendance, talent production, trophies, calibre of managers, competitive balance and each league’s contribution to its national game.

Premier League clubs have the highest average incomes in the world, at around £155m each, and the highest average wages, at £2.3m player per year. Both these figures put the League’s closest rival, Germany’s Bundesliga, in the shade, on £1.46m and £90m comparatively. And Germany are clear of the next league.

Spain’s La Liga is indisputably home to the game’s most stellar names — Ronaldo, Messi, Bale, Suarez and James — but the Premier League is home to the most stars at the summer’s World Cup, 112 of them. The Bundesliga beats the Premier League in average attendance per match, at 42,609 for last year, but the Premier League (36,695) had more fans overall, at 13.94m to 13m in Germany’s top flight.

The French lead the way in one category — talent production. Our study shows French clubs produce more ‘top class’ footballers for teams across Europe’s ‘Big 5’ leagues than those anywhere else in the world. When 118 French-produced exports to rival leagues are added to 75 international-standard players still within France, they have ‘made’ 193 such players.

Spain’s La Liga (133) plus the top divisions in Argentina (111), Brazil (103), Germany (95) and the Premier League (94) make up the top six producers.

Spain is the best league in terms of their clubs winning ‘continental’ trophies over the past decade, with four Champions League wins, and five UEFA Cup/Europa League titles. The Premier League is next best (3 CL, 1 UC).

Using a similar formula to determine which league has the best calibre of managers, overall, England comes out on top because of the global and continental trophy hauls amassed collectively by Jose Mourinho, Louis Van Gaal, Arsene Wenger and Manuel Pellegrini.

The Bundesliga has the second best calibre of managers thanks to the likes of Pep Guardiola (above) 

The Bundesliga is second thanks to Pep Guardiola, Roberto Di Matteo, Jurgen Klopp and others. Spain’s La Liga is third and a surprise fourth place goes to China’s Super League, home in 2014 to World Cup winner Marcello Lippi and Sven Goran Eriksson among an international cast of bosses.

The Premier League performs poorly on competitive balance, with just three different winners in a decade and a global low of five teams in the top three over a decade. Leagues in Sweden, Japan and across the Americas have had as many as seven different winners in a decade.

Germany’s domestic league famously assists their World Cup-winning national team and when fan-ownership and stable finances are considered, Germany comes out on top in the ‘contribution to national game’ category.

When all things are considered, scoring each category winner as 10 points and all other league relative to the winner, the Premier League pips the Bundesliga by a fraction, literally. On penalties, as it were. For a change. For now.
