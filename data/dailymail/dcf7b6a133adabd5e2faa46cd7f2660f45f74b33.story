The party is a grand one, a vast room, buzzing with conversation and the glamour of the capital's movers and shakers. I'd hesitated to attend.

'Not my sort of thing,' I'd blustered, when the impressive 'stiffie' invitation had arrived, with its embossed writing and matching ribbon.

'No,' insisted friends and family, 'you should go. It'll be a great opportunity for networking, meeting people who can advance your career.'

Wallflower: Jenni said she won't make herself the centre of attention at Christmas parties

So, here I am, surrounded by the editor of this, the manager of that . . . good grief, there's the Home Secretary and could that be the Leader of the Opposition? I brace myself to go over, smile, charm, show them how brilliant and interesting I am. Except I can't.

I scan the room, desperate to find someone I actually know, before finding a quiet corner, sitting down with my drink and hoping someone will come and talk to me. I am the wallflower.

I realise that with my persona as the confident presenter of a major national radio programme, thought to have nerves of steel when questioning the toughest of subjects and listened to by millions, the role of wallflower seems an unlikely one. But shy and somewhat retiring on a personal level, I most definitely am.

When, on these occasions, someone does eventually spot me, and sidles over out of chivalry or sympathy to chat, I automatically switch to professional mode, and do what I've always done best.

I offer the platform to them, and interview them, giving them the opportunity to set out their talents and achievements, while I sit back and listen.

There is nothing like a Dame: But she doesn't like to show off about her title

Of course, this talent came in very handy as I was starting out as a young journalist. But today, despite a long career in television and radio and being recognised with the title 'Dame', I’m afraid I haven't progressed.

With Christmas and the party season approaching, I know I'll still be trying to avoid the big events and, if I have to go, I'll still seek out familiar and congenial chums with whom to have a chat and, if they're not there, I'll turn again into the hopeful wallflower, ready to question anyone who joins me about themselves.

I dread to think how many fabulous opportunities I might have missed because I’m congenitally incapable of showing off.

I might have been the UK equivalent of Barbara Walters - a world famous political interviewer for more than half a century and fabulously rich to boot - if only I could have learned to blow my own trumpet. Or maybe I could have been an Oprah Winfrey, my contemporary in age - she's about to turn 60 and I'm 63.

She has just starred in a movie, set up her own TV company and is considered by Forbes magazine to be the most wealthy and powerful 'celebrity' woman in the world.

As interviewers, there's probably not much between us. She even commented, during a recent interview I did with her in a London hotel, on my 'insightful' questioning. I'm absolutely certain I could have lured Lance Armstrong into spilling the beans on his drug use or had Tom Cruise dancing on the sofa - two of her most memorable recent journalistic scoops - given the opportunity.

It was during my encounter with Oprah that I realised what a difference to one's confidence and, consequently, one's prospects the ability to show off can make. Within seconds of the start of our conversation, the subject had turned to her: she was telling me about her humble background in America's deep South.

'My reluctance to blow my own trumpet, has let me down on a number of occasions'

Her great-grandmother was a slave, she pointed out, instantly highlighting the phenomenal leap she has made.

Her mother was a maid, until Oprah had enough money to help her retire. She acknowledged her luck in being born into the era when the civil rights movement began to bite and gave her the opportunity for non-segregated education.

But she was quick to point out that, when she started nursery at three, she could read and knew lots of big words, thanks to her grandmother using the Bible to teach her.

She wrote a letter to her teacher, including all those words - even the biblical characters Meshach and Abednego. She was immediately put into the A-stream and, of course, was top of her class.

She knew how to push herself forward without embarrassment or shame from babyhood. And here she was, doing it again, while, typically, I remained silent.

I could have told her that I, too, was considered a bright little girl: my mother told me I was able to read by the age of three. I would read the cereal packet on the breakfast table, because books weren’t allowed at meal times.

She was so worried about me scouring the Daily Mail every morning - an adult publication, she thought - she bought me the Children's Newspaper to satisfy my hunger for material.

Powerful: Jenni wonders what might have been if she was more like Oprah Winfrey

I was so desperate for education, they had to send me to the local Convent School, even though we weren't Catholics, because it was the only establishment that would take me at the age of three.

It would never have occurred to me to show off about such promising beginnings. (OK, I just did, but it's taken me 60 years to do so!) I know my reticence on these matters, my reluctance to blow my own trumpet, has let me down on a number of occasions.

As a sixth-former I desperately wanted to study drama at Bristol University. I was called for interview.

Faced by a panel of inquisitors, I mumbled my responses to their questions and, even when asked about my favourite playwrights, played down my considerable knowledge.

They rejected me. I made it to my second choice - Hull  solely on the basis of academic achievement. They didn't subject potential students to an interview!

Something similar happened when I first applied to the BBC. I was unsure and nervous. I managed to answer questions about technical matters. My dad had coached me in the workings of a microphone, but this avid reader of newspapers and follower of current events fell to bits when asked about the whereabouts of the Prime Minister.

That little voice in my head, yet again, said: 'Don't get above yourself. You don't belong here.' I failed to show off my knowledge. Rejected again.

I don't think it's a problem confined to my generation. My children and their contemporaries, never told by their parents that they're anything but bright and as good as anybody else, are still reluctant to be seen as 'bigging themselves up'.

There is, I believe, a cultural phenomenon at play here. In America, children are encouraged in school to 'show and tell'.

They stand up in front of the class and learn how to speak in public and show themselves off to their friends. It's a culture that says: 'If you've got it, flaunt it.'

In this country we still don't talk about what we've achieved or what we've earned.

Saucy show-offs

Boasting on social networks gives a similar thrill to sex, say Harvard researchers

Every woman I've asked about their concept of power after they've appeared on the Woman’s Hour Power List - a list of the 100 British women considered to wield real power in this country - has played down the idea they're powerful and, rather apologetically, confessed, maybe, to influence.

I don't, though, see it overall as affecting one gender more than the other.

My dad would never disclose how much he earned in case it was more than the next man and would set him apart. And I've known plenty of boys who can't shake off that essentially English trait - boasting about yourself just isn't done.

When I went to Buckingham Palace in 2011 to be declared Dame Jenni for my services to radio by the Queen, still at the back of my mind was my mother's cautionary voice: 'Don’t show off. Don't get above yourself. A working-class girl from Barnsley is bound to get found out sooner or later.'

Perhaps it's because, in America, wealth and power is the fulfilment of the 'Dream' - to be lauded. We still seem to build up our icons and then, at the merest hint of them 'getting too big for their boots', we bring them down.

It's time we stopped and took pride in what we've created - as a society and as individuals - and learned to show off about it.

So, here's me taking my own advice. I really think I've done rather well, don't you? (Ooh! Sorry!)

Despite long career in broadcasting and title 'Dame' she still can't show off

@highlight

Compares herself to Oprah who, at a similar age, is powerful and confident

Could it be down to cultural differences between UK and U.S.?
