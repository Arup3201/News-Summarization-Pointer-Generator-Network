FBI agents discovered only two guns while raiding the house of a reputed Connecticut mobster suspected of having information about the 1990 robbery of a Boston museum that remains the largest art heist in history.

The mystery deepens after yesterday's search by more than 20 agents in haz-mat suits turned up nothing connected to the art heist.

They examined a car in the driveway, searched a wooded area and removed boxes of evidence from the ranch-style suburban home of 75-year-old Robert Gentile, who has been detained since February on federal drug and weapons charges.

The hunt is on: Law enforcement agents searched the home of reputed 75-year-old Connecticut mobster Robert Gentile yesterday

No stone unturned: An agent in a haz-mat suit searched Gentile's Buick;
but they found nothing in connection with the art heist, only two guns

Teeming: Both local police and FBI were present at Gentile's home all day yesterday

Among the materials the FBI carried from or dug up around Gentile's
home were a gun and a silencer found buried in the backyard, 
according to people familiar with the events.

The pistol and silencer are likely to result in new charges against 
Gentile, a sworn member of the Mafia.

Federal authorities have not tied Gentile to the Gardner job in
public, but they have pressed him privately for information about the 
heist for years, according to a variety of sources familiar with the 
investigation.

During the 1990 robbery, thieves disguised as police officers struck as Boston finished celebrating St Patrick's Day, binding two guards, before stealing masterworks by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas and Manet.

The stolen art is worth more than half a billion dollars.

Despite a $5million ‘no questions asked’ reward by the museum, countless searches, and intense media coverage, no one has been charged in the heist.

When the FBI picked up the hot-tempered Gentile and a 75-year-old 
co-defendant in February on charges of illegally selling prescription 
painkillers, agents asked about the Gardner theft as they drove him from
his home to the federal courthouse in Hartford, according to the 
co-defendant.

Gentile - short, white-haired, overweight and nearly crippled by an assortment of illnesses - claims to know nothing.

'Lies, lies,' Gentile said while appearing in court in March. 'It's all lies.'

Gentile's lawyers claim that federal 
prosecutors are piling charges on a 'sick old man' in a futile effort to
force him to divulge information 
that he doesn't have about the Gardner job.

'They are telling my client he is going to die in jail unless he gives 
them more information, and he doesn't have any more information,' A. 
Ryan McGuigan, one of Gentile's lawyers, said yesterday. 'I'm sure that 
if they can charge him with another crime, they will.'

Mr McGuigan said the FBI returned to 
his client's property in Manchester, just outside Hartford, because the 
agency had a new warrant allowing the use of ground-penetrating radar to
look for buried weapons.

Mr McGuigan said he believes agents are really looking for stolen paintings but will find no such thing.

'This is nonsense,' he said. 'This is the FBI. Are you trying to tell me they missed something the first time? They're trying to find $500 million of stolen artwork... All they're going to find is night crawlers,’ though he later added that he believes authorities had recovered two weapons.

According to the Boston Globe, officials brought in some non-human helpers as well, using two beagles and a ferret to search for possible weapons.

One neighbour told the Globe that the elderly Gentile lives a quiet life with his wife. ‘They are very nice people, very quiet people,’ they said.

A federal prosecutor said in March the FBI believes Gentile had some involvement with stolen property related to the 1990 heist. 

Gentile has not been charged in the art robbery and Mr McGuigan says his client does not know anything about it.

A U.S. attorney's office spokesman declined to comment. A message left with an FBI spokesman was not immediately returned.

His attorney says authorities first approached Gentile about the heist two years ago and, when he offered no information, they dispatched an undercover witness to buy prescription drugs from him.

FBI agents see in Gentile not an old man who limps with a cane but a 
violent gangster who has been active in rackets in Hartford and Boston 
since the 1960s.

In the 1990s, not long after the Gardner job, he was 
associated with a Boston mob crew run by Robert Luisi, a Philadelphia 
gangster who moved into a vacuum created by the FBI's

It was Luisi who 'made' Gentile by inducting him into the Philadelphia mafia group, federal prosecutors said.

Most valuable: Jan Vermeer's The Concert is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter

The museum continues to offer a $5 million, no-questions-asked reward. Gentile's lawyer says that if he were some type of arch-criminal, he would have figured a way to get the reward money.

Prosecutors say Gentile is a member of a Philadelphia crime family. His lawyer denies the mob allegation.

However, Gentile was convicted of larceny in 1996. Convicted felons may not possess firearms or ammunition that have been transported across state lines or from overseas.

Federal law also prohibits possession of a silencer unless it's been registered.

Each of the three weapons charges carries a maximum prison term of 10 years and a fine of up to $250,000.

Authorities say FBI agents have had unproductive discussions with Gentile about the art theft.

The Courant reports that Gentile was deemed a threat to public safety by a federal judge, and will be held without bail while he waits for trial.
