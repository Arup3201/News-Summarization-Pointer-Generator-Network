An octopus floored a wasp. A wolf kicked off a melee. The MailOnline Mascot Derby never fails to deliver, and Friday night was no different.

The real serious entertainment was left to the mavericks at the Kia Oval as south London romped home to clinch victory.

But that's only half the story.

Raucous: There was mayhem as the mascots piled on top of each other with Billy the Badger looking on

The 17 representatives were split into two teams - north and south of the capital - and ended up crashing into each other as the obstacle course was left in tatters.

With the competition descending into farce - there didn't appear any clear leader - Saracens' wolf seized his moment.

Off he went, making a beeline for West Ham United's Hammerhead, and putting his rival down on the floor.

Carnage ensued. Leyton Orient's wyvern waded in, with 'Theo' igniting a pile-on that had supporters in stitches.

And it's a good job. Middlesex had dawdled along to 117-7, heavily indebted to a late dart by Toby Roland-Jones, as Surrey strangled the life out of their rivals before the interval in the Natwest T20 Blast.

The 15,000-strong crowd were treated to what was a drama-filled relay race involving excitable football, cricket and rugby union mascots.

There was definite nervous tension in the air beforehand; some chose to down as much water as possible. Others - Fulham's badger - decided his replenishment just had to be alcoholic. The beers flowed during the Middlesex innings and there was no stopping Billy.

Away he danced, enthusiastically cajoling the crowd before the play fight broke out.

Piles of fun: Bubbles the West Ham bear gets up to mischief as he jumps on the Saracens wolf

Bodies lay strewn on the pitch, some pride had been battered. Chelsea's pair Stamford and Bridget watched on while QPR, Crystal Palace and a rather fiery Tottenham cock all threw themselves into the hilariously mismanaged bundle that spiralled out of control.

Surrey's lion wasn't interested in all that though. Maybe oblivious to what was going on, maybe just that competitive, he strode to the finish line and won it for south London.

But what about the wolf? He wandered off triumphantly with two arms raised. Saracens have a good one there.

All smiles: Chirpy the Tottenham Hotspur cockerel waves for the camera as he walks around the field
