Staff at a McDonald's brought a whole new meaning to Happy Meals when they aired hardcore pornography to late-night diners.

The branch in a small Swiss town showed explicit scenes including several different kinds of sex acts on the in-store televisions.

Presumably the sound was turned off, for a witness reported that the hard core broadcasts went on for some time before staff even noticed it was playing.

That's not tartare sauce! A shocked youth looks up at television screens showing hardcore porn at a branch of McDonald's in a small Swiss town after workers tuned into a sports channel that switched to adult fare

The company has since apologised, saying workers had switched to a German sports channel at a customer's request - without realising that later in the evening the station switched to adult fare.

The incident occurred in Zuchwil, a town of about 8,600 in the Swiss canton of Solothurn, where the diner who took these photos went to the McDonald's with some friends for hamburgers.

They weren't expecting to get a free side order of X-rated sauce from the Sexy Sports Clips programme aired by the Munich-based Sport 1 channel.

The skin flick had followed on after the end of the usual sports broadcasting that evening.

'We were only a group of men so it didn't bother us, although what would have happened if there was a family in the restaurant at that time I don't know,' said the diner, who sent these pictures into Swiss news site 20 Minuten.

An employee finally noticed there was a problem and changed the channel.

Double Sausage and Egg McMuffin: McDonald's local representatives apologised for the mistake but said it was pardonable since workers were obviously to busy attending to customers to realise that was on TV

McDonald's said employees usually left TVs tuned to the Eurosport channel, but sometimes workers 'change the channel to please a customer,' McDonald's spokesman Aglae Strachwitztold 20 Minuten.

On this occasion it was changed to a different sports channel that, unbeknown to the staff, also included a porn show. She said the mistake was pardonable.

'If our employees didn't immediately realise what was going on it's because they were concentrating on our customers and their work,' she said.
