Brussels red tape is ‘throttling’ British business, David Cameron has warned ahead of a summit with European Union leaders.

The Prime Minister is to push for a one-in, one-out rule, to halt the growth in EU regulations.

Mr Cameron, who spent the day visiting online fashion chain ASOS in Barnsley, will travel to Brussels Marks & Spencer chief executive Marc Bolland and angel investor Dale Murray to step up pressure for major reform.

Mr Cameron discussed the challenges faced by British firms with ASOS boss Nick Robertson, as he toured the firm's huge warehouse.

Mr Cameron's wife Samantha is known to be a fan of the company, after wearing a £42 teal ASOS dress to the Tory conference earlier this month.

EU leaders meet in Brussels today and tomorrow to discuss ways to improve growth and competitiveness across Europe.

Ahead
of the meeting, Open Europe published a list of the 100 most costly EU 
regulations to the UK economy using data from the UK Government’s impact
assessments of these rules.

It
concludes they cost the economy £27.4 billion a year - more than what 
the UK Treasury expects to raise in revenue from council tax.

In
at least 24 cases, the Government’s own impact assessment finds that 
the estimated costs outweigh the estimated benefits - meaning that they 
impose a net cost on the UK economy.

Mr Cameron will press the case for curbing EU rules and regulations to help business during a dinner with other leaders tonight at the start of the European Council.

Ahead of the meeting he said: ‘On the red tape they are currently throttled with, we are dealing with that at every level, including at the European Council coming up this week, where I have organised a meeting for our businesses to explain their proposals for cutting red tape to fellow European leaders from Finland, Italy, Germany and elsewhere.

‘It is an agenda right across the board to help small businesses grow our economy.’

Mr Bolland and Ms Murray are part of the Prime Minister's business taskforce, which produced a report that came up with 30 recommendations to save companies billions. Just relaxing rules on health and safety would save more than £2 billion across Europe, it found.

Leading businesses, including Vodafone, Tata Steel and Jaguar Land Rover, have sent an open letter to EU leaders gathering at the summit in Brussels warning them that bureaucracy is holding back growth.

It states: ‘As European business leaders, we know first hand the challenges that businesses are facing in the current economic climate.

'One of the greatest obstacles is problematic, poorly-understood and burdensome European rules that all too often encumber business.’

The group warns it is vital that any EU regulation necessary for the single market is pro-growth, ‘enabling not hampering businesses to create jobs’.

It points to the ‘concrete’ proposals devised by the business taskforce to cut unnecessary rules, regulations and practices that are ‘holding our companies back’, claiming the reforms could save European businesses billions of euros.

‘We are now calling on you, as EU leaders, to ensure that EU regulation is focused on securing the competitiveness of European business, and to place the 'compete principles' at the heart of EU policy-making,’ the letter adds.

‘And we urge you to demonstrate leadership by making a strong commitment at this week's European Council to identify where the burden of regulation can be reduced to allow businesses to generate the growth that will benefit us all.’

On the eve of the summit European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso challenged Mr Cameron and other EU leaders to cut bureaucratic red tape in their own countries and to stop ‘gold plating’ existing EU rules - making them tougher than originally intended.

He insisted that Brussels was already doing its bit, repealing nearly 6,000 pieces of EU legislation and saving billions of pounds in the process since 2005.
