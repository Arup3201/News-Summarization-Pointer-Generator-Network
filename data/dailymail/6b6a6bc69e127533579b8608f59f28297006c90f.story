The Benetton Formula One car that launched the career of legendary multiple world champion Michael Schumacher is set to be auctioned off.

A 23-year-old Schumacher raced this very car to his first ever podium finish at the last Mexican Grand Prix in his debut F1 season back in 1992.

And racing fans will have the opportunity to buy a piece of F1 history when the Benetton-Ford B191B goes under the hammer at Bonhams Bond Street sale on Sunday.

The car, that is in full working order and in almost the exact same condition as when it was last driven by Schumacher, will set you back as much as £300,000, experts are predicting.

Schumacher's third-place finish in Mexico kick-started a career of unprecedented success. The German won seven drivers' championships during a ten-year domination of the sport between 1994 and 2004.

He also achieved a staggering 91 race wins, 40 more than any other driver in the history of F1.

The car was shortly retired after Schumacher claimed his first podium finish in 1992

The Benetton was powered by a Ford 3.5-litre V8 engine with a whopping 730 horse power

'Chassis 6 is highly respected as the Benetton that took Schumacher to his first podium position,' said James Knight, Bonhams International Head of Motoring.

'But, that's not where the story ends, for this was also the car that took three-time Formula One World Champion driver, Brazil's Nelson Piquet, through his last Grand Prix on the beautiful Adelaide street and parkland circuit in the 1991 season.'
