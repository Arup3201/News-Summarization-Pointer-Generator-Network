Four Manus Island detainees have sewn their lips together in protest over the disgusting living conditions at the site and at their lack of visa prospects for the future. 

Of the 1200 detainees on the island, only 13 have been processed and given visas in the past 17 months, leading to massive protests and brawls on Manus Island.

It is believed that the 13 people who have been granted a temporary visa are required to reapply annually and are expected to live off $46 a week, until they find a job.

Unrest has broken out at the camp, as the asylum seekers grow frustrated at the lack of a guarantee about their future in Australia.

The four men who have sewn their lips together all come from the Oscar compound and are from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon. 

Others from the Oscar and Mike camps began a hunger strike on Wednesday, as part of the protest, with reports of collapses among the strikers already

It is believed that up to five of the hunger strikers have been taken away to receive medical treatment due to dehydration. 

According to The Guardian, a letter obtained by the paper reveals exactly how horrific the conditions in the camp are, with asylum seekers claiming they 'have been caught up in hell'.

'The desperate situation is much worse than you imagine,' the letter said. 

The men in the letter say there are up to 50 men crammed into one room at a time in stifling heat and another man said he feared he would die due to an ear infection that has not been treated. 

This comes after Reza Berati was beaten to death in riots on the island in February.  

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison introduced new immigration laws this week, which means more than 100 children on Christmas Island will be released into Australia on temporary visas
