An Australian three-year-old holidaying with her family in New York City has narrowly escaped death after a traffic light pole fell and crushed her stroller when two double-decker tour buses collided in Times Square.

Lila Meredith was taken to a nearby hospital, but her father said apart from being 'a little shaken' she was given the all clear.

One of the bus drivers, William Dalambert, 58, of New Jersey was charged with driving while impaired.

Aftermath: People gather at the scene where at the corner of 47th Street and 7th Avenue in Times Square after after two tour buses smashed into each other

It is alleged Dalambert was the driver of a CitySights bus that slammed into a stopped Gray Line bus near the corner of West 47th St and Seventh Avenue on Tuesday (local time).

The Gray Line bus mounted the sidewalk and knocked down the traffic light pole, striking Brisbane's Meredith family, who were walking through Times Square, according to police.

At least 15 people were hurt, although none had life-threatening injuries, police said.

It was decided Lila should be checked out at the hospital.

'It's just a precautionary check,' Lila's father, Martin, told the Wall Street Journal.

'She'll be fine.

'A little shaken as you would expect.'

The collision between the two buses was so loud pedestrians thought it was a bomb.

Police said Dalambert first side-swiped a SUV and struck a parked double-decker bus, before mounting the curb.

According to Good Morning America, police have not ruled out that drugs were involved.
