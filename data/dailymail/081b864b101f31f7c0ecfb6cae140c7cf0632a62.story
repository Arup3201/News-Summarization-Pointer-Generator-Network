Is this photographer faster than his own shadow?

These startling pictures taken by Pol Úbeda Hervàs certainly seem to show just that, as the Catalan-artist has produced a series of thought-provoking photos of his own shadow just wearing trainers.

Hervàs, who is the creative and art 
director of Advertising firm JWT Barcelona, is believed to have created the images through Photoshop, leaving audiences perplexed.

Shadow of his former self: Catalan photographer Pol Úbeda Hervàs said a couple of experiences left him unsure of himself to the point he didn't recognise himself in photos

Abstract: PoL Úbeda Hervàs who lives and works in Barcelona said he photographed 
his shadow but decided to leave the shoes as a small reminder that there
was at least some fragment of his personality left behind

Shadow work: The artist said: 'I don't recognize myself any more. These photos 
express this feeling. These pictures are the way I see myself now

He said the series came from 
changes in his life that left him unsure of who he was. He decided to leave the shoes as a small reminder that there was at least some fragment of his personality left behind so that he was more than just a shadow.

Hervàs said: 'I don’t recognize myself any more. These photos express this feeling. These pictures are the way I see myself now.

'My shadow is there but I erase myself because I don't know who I am any longer.

'The shoes remain only to make sure there is something more than a shadow.'

'I’m Not There' is an ongoing series of portraits by Hervàs who divides his time between his work at the Barcelona advertising agency and photography.

Hervàs doesn't explain the nature of the experiences that forced him to question his own identity, but he wrote a few lines that accompany the images, in which he says: I am changing at this very moment of my life. I do not react in the same ways I used to. These pictures are the way I see myself now.'

Neither does he say whether his choice to leave shoes rather than any other item of clothing was a conscious one.

Shoes, according to psychologists reveal much about the wearer's personality.

Last year psychologists from the University of 
Kansas found that the style, 
value, colour and condition of the footwear can paint a picture of the 
owner's emotional, political and other vital personality traits.

63 students from the university looked at photographs showing 208 different 
pairs of shoes belonging to volunteers in the experiment.

They were asked to look at each pair and guess the gender, age and
social status of the owner, researchers reported to the Journal of 
Research in Personality.

This
including whether the owner was an extrovert or introvert, liberal 
leaning or conservative, their emotional stability, agreeableness, 
conscientiousness and openness.

The team reported: 'Shoes convey a thin but useful slice of information about their wearers.

'Shoes serve a practical purpose, and 
also serve as nonverbal cues with symbolic messages. People tend to pay 
attention to the shoes they and others wear.

'Shoes
have great variety of styles, brands, looks, and functions. Because of 
this variety, shoes can carry individual difference information, but do 
they?

'We suggest that the answer is yes.'
