Manchester United's International Champions Cup clash with European champions Real Madrid on Saturday  is expected to provide the largest crowd ever for a football match in America.

The ‘Big House’ stadium in Michigan is expected to welcome 109,000 fans and is the largest ground in the States.

Fitting, then, that such a crowd should be entertained by some of the world’s best players from two of the most iconic clubs on the planet. If America doesn’t ‘get’ football after this, it arguably never will.

Heading for the final: Manchester United are poised to top Group A in the International Champions Cup

While many Americans will struggle to tell their Rooneys from their Ronaldos, the one thing they are sure to understand is money.

Forbes, the esteemed American business magazine, have published a Top 10 of the world’s most valuable clubs, with United and Real occupy two of the top three spots.

The European champions lead with an estimated total value of £2.04billion, but United are not far behind with £1.71bn. Sandwiched in the middle are Barcelona at £1.9bn.

But for all their spending, Real cannot make the final of the tournament on Monday no matter the result against United.

Louis van Gaal’s side lead Group A and could face either Manchester City or Liverpool in the final in Miami.

United won on penalties against Inter Milan in Washington DC after beating Roma 3-2 in Denver.

Roma and Inter both have three points after two games, while Madrid's defeat by Roma on Tuesday ended their hopes of qualifying for the final.

Liverpool lead Group B, one point ahead of Manchester City. Greek side Olympiacos, who are also in contention to make the final, follow with three points, while AC Milan are yet to get off the mark. 

Stateside following: The Red Devils have enjoyed large support during their tour

 All teams play three fixtures before the winners of each group meet in Miami.

Group A results: United 3 Roma 2; Real Madrid 1 Inter 1 (Inter 3-2 pens); United 0 v Inter 0 (United 5-3 pens), Real Madrid 0 Roma 1

Group B results: Olympiacos 3 AC Milan 0; AC Milan 1 Man City 5; Liverpool 1 Olympiacos 0; Liverpool 2 Man City 2 (Liverpool 3-1 pens)

TRANSFERS THIS SUMMER

Manchester United have so far spent a total of £55m, although van Gaal is expect to add more players once the Red Devils return from the States.

After two years of nearly signing central-midfielder Ander Herrera, the 24-year-old finally arrived this summer in a £29m deal from Athletic Bilbao.

Teenaged defender Luke Shaw’s departure from Southampton was equally nothing of a surprise and his transfer fee of £27m could rise to £31.5m depending upon appearances.

Big money: Luke Shaw joined United from Southampton for a fee which could rise to £31.5million

Toni Kroos had been linked with a move to United for much of last season, but the 24-year-old midfielder eventually clinched a £20m switch to the Bernabeu after winning the World Cup with Germany.

However, Madrid’s marquee signing came in the shape of Colombia’s World Cup inspiration James Rodriguez. The striker’s £63m switch from Monaco is big business.

The 23-year-old won the Golden Boot in Brazil and ensured Madrid kept pace with Barcelona and their purchase of Liverpool’s Luis Suarez.

WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM

Manchester United have just signed a world-record £750m kit deal with German's sportswear giant adidas.

The 10-year partnership puts United way out ahead of Europe’s other leading clubs, although it will be cut by 30 per cent if they fail to qualify for the Champions League for two consecutive seasons. United stay with Nike until 2015-16 campaign.

United have also secured a shirt sponsorship deal with £53m a year with leading luxury American car company Chevrolet.

United’s Old Trafford is usually a sell-out for home Premier League games with a capacity of 75,731.

United have an overall average income of around £380m per year.

First and last: Nike will supply United for the final time during the 2014-15 season before adidas take over, while Chevrolet have just started a sponsorship deal worth £53m-a-year

Real Madrid are also tied to adidas, with a shirt deal worth £31m a year until 2020. Their kit sponsorship arrangement with the Emirates airline brings in an additional £23m-a-year.

Real’s iconic Bernabeu can seat 85,454 when full and the club's revenue at the last reckoning was said to be worth around £428m-a-year.
