Anti-terror police made more than 160 Syria-related arrests in the UK last year - a six-fold increase on 2013.

A total of 165 arrests were made by police officers across the country for offences including terrorist financing, commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and attending a terrorist training camp, Scotland Yard said. 

This compares to 25 Syria-related arrests the previous year.

The announcement comes as UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon paints a worsening picture of the war in Syria, citing indiscriminate government bombing and opposition shelling, high civilian casualties and deteriorating humanitarian conditions.

Islamic State: A new Counter-terrorism and Security Bill, containing a range of draconian powers including new orders that can block suspected British fighters from returning to the UK, is passing through Parliament

The total number of arrests for terrorist offences in 2014 was 327, a 32 per cent increase compared to the previous year.

Helen Ball, senior national co-ordinator for counter terrorism policing, said: 'Last year's arrest figures demonstrate a considerable increase in volume, range and pace of counter-terrorism activity in the UK.

'We have been running exceptionally high numbers of investigations, the likes of which we have not seen for many years.

'Several attack plots have been disrupted, of various sophistication, from individuals planning to carry out lone attacks to more complex conspiracies, the majority seemingly directed by or inspired by terrorism overseas.

'The partnership between police and MI5 is very effective, and we are experiencing very strong support from the communities.

'We will continue with this vital work to protect and work with the UK public to combat terrorism in all its forms.' 

Worsening picture: In his monthly report to the UN Security Council made public today, Ban Ki-moon paints a worsening picture of the war in Syria

In his monthly report to the UN Security Council made public today, the secretary-general said the use of roadside and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices increased and more than 21 suicide operations were reported in the Syrian provinces of Aleppo, Hama and Daraa in December.

He said fighters from Islamic State reportedly incurred heavy casualties in intensified fighting with Kurdish forces last month, and the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front reportedly continued to attract additional fighters and resources, particularly in Idlib and Daraa.

Mashudur Choudhury, the first Briton to be prosecuted for travelling to Syria to join ISIS

The terror threat level in the UK was raised from substantial to severe last August against a backdrop of increasing concerns over hundreds of aspiring British jihadis travelling to Syria and Iraq to learn terrorist 'tradecraft'.

Fears of a terrorist attack on Britain's streets have heightened in the wake of the rise of ISIS, which has taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria and attracted thousands of foreign jihadists to its cause, including more than 500 Britons.

A new Counter-terrorism and Security Bill, containing a range of draconian powers including new orders that can block suspected British fighters from returning to the UK, is passing through Parliament.

In December, father-of-two Mashudur Choudhury, 31, who was the first Briton to be prosecuted for travelling to Syria to join ISIS, was jailed for four years.

He was the only one of a group of six young men from Portsmouth to have returned after joining the brutal terror group.

All but one of those who stayed has since been killed in the fighting - but Choudhury was apparently sent back after failing the selection process.  

He was found guilty in May of preparing acts of terrorism.
