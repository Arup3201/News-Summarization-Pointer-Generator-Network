Charged: Gabriel Quintero, 18, and three underage friends have been charged with animal cruelty

Police have arrested four teens, age 18, 17 and 16, for the fowl massacre of nearly 1,000 chickens that were bludgeoned to death with golf clubs and other blunt instruments at an industrial farm in California's Central Valley.

The 'psychopaths' broke into a Foster Farms chicken house near Fresno on September 20 and mutilated 920 chickens overnight. 

The company and a local animal rights group both offered cash rewards for information leading to the perpetrators. 

The public push payed off. Just hours after police publicized the attack, detectives were alerted to chatter on social media that identified the suspects.

Fresno County sheriff's deputies arrested 18-year-old Gabriel Quintero, two 17-year-olds and a 16-year-old on Wednesday.

Police say they pulled back a side wall of a chicken house then played 18 holes with the helpless fowl inside. 

All four are charged with burglary and felony animal cruelty.

The three juveniles were taken to Fresno Juvenile Justice Center. 

Detectives discovered a piece of a golf club that the burglars had left behind.

'Psychopathic behavior, it’s sick behavior. And people who will do this, it can definitely lead to other things,' Fresno County sheriff's deputy Chris Curtice told KPIX-TV.  

Foster Farms said the birds were worth about $5,000. 

'This appears to be a random act of violence. It is the express policy of Foster Farms to treat its birds humanely and with compassion. Any intentional act to the contrary is unacceptable,' the company said in a statement. 

Workers say they were horrified by the mess left  from the mutilated birds. 

'It’s crazy that someone would break into the chicken shed to kill them. It’s just crazy,' employee Antonio Puentes told KPIX.
