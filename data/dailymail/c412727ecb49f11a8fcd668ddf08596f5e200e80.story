She seems just like any other two-year-old girl, giggling as she tries to copy what her older brother does and chases him around the house.

But her mobility is even more impressive when you learn Alissa Perkins was born without a crucial bone in her body and wears a prosthetic left leg.

The remarkably active life that she can lead has led the hospital that gave Alissa treatment to ask her family to be ambassadors for its chain.

Toddler: Alissa Perkins, of Las Vegas, Nevada, was born without a crucial bone but is able to live an active life because she was fitted with a prosthetic left leg

Swinging time: Alissa's family met Shriners ambassador Katie Walker at a local golf course, who was wearing a prosthetic limb on her leg above the knee

Alissa lives with her mother Tara, father Mark and four-year-old brother Nicholas at their home in Las Vegas, Nevada.

She gets orthopaedic care at the Shriners Hospital in Los Angeles, California - part of a 22-hospital system that the family is working with.

‘It's hard to believe that everything has worked out so well'

‘It's hard to believe that everything has worked out so well,’ primary school teacher Tara Perkins told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

It all started when the family met Katie Walker, who wore a prosthetic limb on her leg above the knee, at a local golf course.

Alissa was aged only three months at the time in 2009 and Ms Walker, a Shriners ambassador, told them how she had been helped by the hospital.

Their girl was then taken to the Los Angeles hospital, where physicians said bone lengthening could put her in a wheelchair for many years.

When Mrs Perkins was several weeks pregnant, she learned there was bowing in her baby’s left femur, also known as the thigh bone.

There was also bowing and shortening of the tibia in the baby’s lower left leg - and she was missing her left fibula, or calf bone.

When Alissa was born her left leg was shorter than her right, reported the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

But her parents also found out that an above-ankle amputation, with a new prosthetic leg every year as she grew up, would allow her to be active.

‘I saw other kids who had gone through that, and they all were doing fine,’ Mrs Perkins told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

‘What they've been able to do with a prosthesis is just unbelievable.’

Alissa had the amputation as a nine-month-old baby and she was walking only four months later. She has since outgrown two prosthetic legs.

The Shriners network treats all children whether they can pay or not.
