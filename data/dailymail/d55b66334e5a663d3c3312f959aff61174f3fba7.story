Mitt Romney has taken a potentially decisive step towards securing the Republican presidential nomination by coasting to victory over Rick Santorum in the Illinois primary.

With nearly 90 per cent of the vote in, the former Massachusetts governor was on 45 per cent, 12-points ahead of his main rival, with Ron Paul on eight per cent and Newt Gingrich languishing ignominiously in fourth.

The victory was an important one because it was in a Mid-Western state, it followed a double loss to Santorum in the Deep South last week and it extended Romney’s delegate lead making it all but mathematically impossible his rivals achieve the 1,144 needed for outright victory.

Hand on heart: Mitt Romney has taken a potentially decisive step towards securing the Republican presidential nomination by coasting to victory over Rick Santorum in the Illinois primary last night

Looking ahead: Romney makes a victory speech in Schaumburg, Illinois, where he kept his focus on Barack Obama rather than his Republican primary opponents

It was also symbolic that Romney won 
the home state of President Barack Obama, the man he will almost 
certainly face in November, though in a general election Illinois is a 
Democratic stronghold.

With
the Louisiana primary on Saturday marking the half-way point in the 
Republican race, Romney has well over 500 delegates and now enters a 
phase when he has the opportunity to rack up some big delegate hauls.

In a victory speech in Schaumburg, Illinois, Romney kept his focus on Obama rather than his Republican primary opponents.

'Three
years of Barack Obama have brought us fewer jobs and shrinking 
paychecks, but many of us believed we were in danger of losing something
even more than the value of our homes and our 401(k)s,' he said.

'After years of too many apologies and 
not enough jobs, historic drops in income and historic highs in gas 
prices, a president who doesn't hesitate to use all the means necessary 
to force through Obamacare on the American public, but leads from behind
in the world. It's time to say these words, this word: enough. We've 
had enough.'

Victory lap: Romney celebrates with his wife Ann. He won Illinois by a wide margin - his third big industrial state victory against Rick Santorum

Distant second: Rick Santorum spent the last week defending himself against gaffes and self-inflicted injuries

Despite big losses on Super Tuesday and in the South last week, Mitt Romney retains a massive advantage in the number of convention delegates.

If he continues at this pace, he will reach the 1,144 needed to clinch the Republican presidential nomination at the GOP convention in August.

(All numbers exclude Tuesday's win, which offers 59 delegates awarded by Congressional district.)

Mitt Romney: 522

Victories: New Hampshire, Florida, Nevada, Maine, Michigan, Arizona, Wyoming, Washington, Ohio, Virginia, Massachusetts, Idaho, Alaska, Vermont, Guam, Northern Marianas, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii, American Samoa and Puerto Rico

Rick Santorum: 253

Victories: Iowa, Minnesota, Colorado, Tennessee, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Kansas, Alabama and Mississippi

Newt Gingrich: 135

Victories: South Carolina and Georgia

Ron Paul: 50

Victories: None

Exit polls found that Romney, whose staunchest base of support was in Chicago and its suburbs, performed well among graduates, Catholics and voters who see the economy as the most important issue facing the country.

In a comprehensive victory, he also had an edge over Santorum among those describing themselves as conservative. Only among white evangelicals and those identifying as 'very conservative' did Santorum, a hard-line Catholic, prevail.

Romney, the long-time party establishment favourite and undisputed frontrunner since his six-out-of-10 victories on 'Super Tuesday' this month, was helped in Illinois by a huge spending advantage over the other candidates.

Also helping Romney was the belief that he has the best chance to defeat Obama in November. Exit polls indicated that 60 per cent thought Romney was the most electable candidate, compared to 23 per cent for Santorum.

Romney will take most of the 54 delegates up for grabs in Illinois. Santorum was ineligible for 10 delegates because of campaign disorganisation. Neither Paul nor Gingrich nor Paul seriously contested the state.

Before the vote Santorum said he was hoping for a surprise victory driven by the more rural, conservative voters in the southern and western part of the state. That outcome, he insisted, would 'really send shockwaves' through the Republican establishment.

He held four rallies and conducted 19 interviews in Illinois on voting day in a last-ditch effort to boost turnout among his downstate supporters before heading to his home state of Pennsylvania, which votes on April 24.

Key win: While Romney's victory in Illinois will not end the GOP primary, his wide margin has greatly bolstered his status as front-runner

All eyes on Illinois: The primary in the heavily-Democratic state boiled down to a contest between Romney and Santorum

Acknowledging defeat, Santorum was notably less combative in attacking Romney, perhaps a sign that he was beginning to accept that his rival would be the party’s nominee. He touted his blue-collar roots, contrasting them with Romney’s Wall Street credentials.

'I learned everything about freedom and opportunity and hard work growing up with folks who worked in the mills and mines,' he said.

Vowing to stay in the race, he told his supporters to 'saddle up like Reagan did in the cowboy movies,' reassuring them it would be 'five weeks to a big win and a big delegate sweep in Pennsylvania.'

As well as Pennsylvania, Santorum expects to win in the Louisiana and then Arkansas and Kentucky on May 22. He has also set his sights on a big win in Texas, which offers 155 delegates and which holds a primary on May 29.

But in the short term, Romney hopes to score April wins in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Wisconsin, Connecticut, Delaware, New York and Rhode Island. A Romney win in Pennsylvania could seal Santorum’s fate.
