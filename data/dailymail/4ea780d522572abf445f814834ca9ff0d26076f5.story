There was a tense moment at the G20 leaders' barbecue on Saturday when U.S. President Barack Obama stood up suddenly.

Brisbane chef Ben O'Donoghue, who catered the event, said the organisers had eyes on Mr Obama and they started speaking into their earpieces as soon as he left his table.

'They were saying "The President's on the move, the President's on the move",' Mr O'Donoghue told Daily Mail Australia.

'Which then changed to "Oh, stand down, he's just going back to the buffet".'

The buffet meal was served to world leaders at Queensland Parliament House on Saturday afternoon

Mr O'Donoghue served the most powerful men and women in the world a 'laid back' buffet-style barbecue – though the menu was a great deal fancier than your average Saturday sausage sizzle.

Following the Leaders' Retreat at Queensland Parliament House, guests were served a number of dishes including barbecued new season asparagus with peas and goats curd, freshly shucked Moreton Bay rock oysters and smoked and spiced Flinders Island butterflied leg of lamb with yoghurt and eggplant.

Mr O'Donoghue, from Billy Cart Kitchen in inner-city Annerley, described the affair as 'pretty cool'

'I was given a brief that Tony Abbott wanted to keep it pretty informal,' Mr O'Donoghue told Daily Mail Australia.

'He wanted to go against regular protocol and make it more relaxing for the leaders.'

Mr O'Donoghue, from Billy Cart Kitchen in inner-city Annerley, described the affair as 'pretty cool'.

'I was nervous, the first three people who came up to the buffet were Barack Obama, the Chinese leader and Tony Abbott,' he said

'Barack Obama came back for seconds which was fantastic.

'It's definitely been the highlight of my career.' 

Mr O'Donoghue and his team had the plates of seafood, meat and salads laid out on a table and he served the leaders and answered their questions as they grabbed plates and filled them with food.

'They all asked what Moreton Bay bugs are,' he said.

'The Indian Prime Minister was very interested in which dishes had animal products, he's completely vegetarian.'

Mr O'Donoghue added that Mr Putin was not treated frostily by the other leaders, and there was more activity on his table than most other people's.

'He spent a lot of time talking with the South Korean President,' Mr O'Donoghue said.

Mr O'Donoghue said he had carte blanche to do whatever he wanted with the menu – apart from keeping the meat halal and catering to a few dietary requirements – and he tried to focus on fresh and local ingredients.

The salads on offer included Vannella buffalo mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and basil; barbecued new season asparagus, peas, broad beans and goats curd with Mount Zero wild olives and salad with kale, broccoli and avocado with toasted seeds.

Seafood included freshly shucked Moreton Bay rock oysters and cooked Mooloolaba king prawns with lime mayonnaise.

From the barbecue, leaders enjoyed Moreton Bay bugg, figs, pancetta and fresh bay kebabs with chimichurri; crispy skin Tasmanian ocean trout, avocado, apple, radish and watercress salad and smoked and spiced Flinders Island butterflied leg of lamb with yoghurt and eggplant.

Dessert was a classic Australian pavlova.

Leaders were entertained by classical guitar duo the Grigoryan Brothers.

On Saturday night the leaders dined in a more formal setting at the Queensland Art Gallery, while conducting talks about global trade.

Leaders dined surrounded by artworks from the gallery's Australian collection and were entertained by Australian musicians Emma Matthews, Megan Washington Paul Grabowsky and Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu.

Chef Josue Lopez served guests an entrée of scallops from Hervey Bay, organic cauliflower from the Lockyer Valley and Mooloolaba squid broth.

The main course featured Kenilworth Wagyu beef, and Kalbar carrots with Symphony Hill Shiraz jus.

Dessert was wattle seed custard, Daintree chocolate and vanilla curd, followed by petit fours.
