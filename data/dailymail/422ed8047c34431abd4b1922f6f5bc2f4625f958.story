Venice has been described as the most beautiful city built by man and has captured the hearts of many tourists who have visited the group of 118 small islands.

And now for the first time, people can take a trip down the Grand Canal or explore the impossibly complex network of tiny waterways by gondola, from the comfort of their own home, as Google has added the city to Google Street View.

The internet giant sent a team of people to map Venice by foot, because the Street View car and trike could not be used on the city's narrow cobbled streets.

The team even loaded the ‘trekker,’ which is used to map locations, onto a boat that navigated canals and dodged gondolas to give people at home a ‘totally immersive’ view of the city.

Google said: ‘Welcome to Venice, Italy, the city built on water. Travel the canals, walk the streets, ride boats, cross bridges and plan your own adventure in one of the world’s most unique cities.’

Venice is made up of a group of 118 small islands separated by canals and linked by bridges.

The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC.

The Republic of Venice was a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance.

It was an important centre of commerce and art in the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history.

People can now explore the ‘panoramic imagery of one of the most romantic spots in the world,’ according to Google, by selecting a mode of transport on the website.

They can walk the streets by foot, travel by Gondola (or Google's small boat) to get a view of the city from the water or choose to cruise the Grand Canal and lagoon by Vaporetto - a larger type of boat.

Major monuments such as St Marks’s Square and the Rialto Bridge, as well as the large lagoon area, have been mapped and Street View allows people to see how the layout of the city and its architectural icons have changed over the centuries.

Google’s ‘trekkers’ covered a lot of ground, which worked out as around 265 miles on foot and 114 miles by boat.

They captured the biggest tourist attractions as well as hidden gems, such as the Synagogue of the first Jewish Ghetto, the Devil’s Bridge on Torcello island and even a mask designed to scare the devil away on the church of Santa Maria Formosa.

Google said: ‘Unfortunately, Street View can’t serve you a cicchetto (local appetiser) in a classic bacaro (a typical Venetian bar), though we can show you how to get there.’

Once armchair tourists have explored the city’s streets, they can view artworks of the Museo Corner, which has joined the Google Cultural Institute along with Museo del Vetro and Ca’ Pesaro  - International Gallery of Modern Art.
