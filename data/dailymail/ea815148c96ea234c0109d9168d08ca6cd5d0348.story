A shootout between security forces and prisoners at a jail in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo has left at least 27 people dead today.

It is believed the fighting began when police went to Welikoda prison to conduct a search and were attacked by inmates hurling stones.

It appears inmates managed to overpower their guards and seize their weapons before taking over part of the jail.

Police said they arrested five prisoners who had managed to escape and were searching for others.

The clash led to a stand-off between 
police and inmates who were 
pictured on top of the roof holding rifles.

Some other prisoners piled into a 
three-wheeled vehicle and began driving toward a main city road before 
security forces outside the prison opened fire.

The vehicle stopped and 
three unmoving bodies could be seen, AP has reported.

Dozens of security officers then entered the prison and volleys of gunfire rang out and prisoners could be heard screaming: 'Stop shooting!'

Army troops were called in later to help control the situation, which had returned to normal by Saturday morning.

'The prison is now totally under our control,' said Sri Lanka's Commissioner General of Prisons P.W. Kodippili.

He said security forces had found
the bodies of 11 other inmates inside the prison premises, and that the
total number of deaths stood at 27.

Kodippili declined to say how many inmates may have escaped, but said search operations were under way to find others who may have fled.

The inmates had broken into the prison's two armories during the riot and taken weapons stored there, he said. The inmates opened fire at police commandos, who shot back.

He said that security forces had so far recovered 76 weapons taken by the prisoners and that six more weapons were still missing.

Dr. Anil Jasinghe, director of the Colombo National Hospital, said the bodies of 16 inmates were at his hospital.

Twenty-three inmates injured
in the clash were receiving treatment at the hospital, Dr Jasinghe 
said. Thirteen police officers, four soldiers, a prison guard and a 
passer-by also were being treated there for injuries.

Police spokesman Prishantha Jayakody said five inmates who had escaped from the prison, which was the site of another riot earlier this year, were arrested.

He said the had fighting begun when police commandos went to the prison to conduct a search and were attacked by inmates hurling stones.

Sri Lankan officials often conduct raids inside prisons looking for narcotics and communication devices.

A clash between inmates and guards at the same prison last January wounded 28 people. Those prisoners were protesting the authorities' move to curtail drug smuggling into the facility.
