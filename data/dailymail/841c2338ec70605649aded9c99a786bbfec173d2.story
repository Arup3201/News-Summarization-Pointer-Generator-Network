Parents should not let children have televisions or computers in their bedrooms, an education minister said last night.

During a debate in Parliament about the harmful impact of pornography on youngsters, Lord Nash said that unfortunately it was a ‘fact of life’ that parents gave their children such free rein.

The junior schools minister said he was concerned that many parents simply ‘do not understand’ that their children can access such ‘dreadful’ hard core material on the internet.

His comments follow concerns that porn is too easily available on the web and that there is little to stop children with TVs in their bedroom watching adult programmes shown after the watershed.

There are also fears that children are not playing out enough because they spend too much time playing on computers or watching TV in their rooms - fuelling child obesity.

Peers lined up to attack the government for its failure at Tuesday’s internet safety summit to force web firms to automatically block online porn. Campaigners want over-18s only to able to see adult images if they specifically opt in following a strict age verification check.

Baroness Benjamin, the former Play School presenter, said ministers’ failure could see children ending up in a ‘moral wasteland’.

During the question and answer session in the House of Lords, Lord Nash was asked by 90-year-old Tory peer Baroness Sharples: ‘Why do parents allow children to have computers in their room, even encourage them?’

The minister strongly concurred, replying: ‘Or televisions, for that matter. I agree.’

He hinted that children do not play out enough nowadays, and spend too much time on their computers in their rooms - saying they now learn about what is outside their front door from the web.

Lord Nash said: ‘However, it is a fact of life these days, I am afraid, that the internet is the “pavement” for our children. That is why this is such an important issue, and parents do not understand enough about it.’

Baroness Benjamin, a Lib Dem peer, warned that children are now ‘re-enacting pornographic behaviour’ because of what they see on the web.

The former children’s presenter, a familiar face in the 1980s, condemned the government for being too weak with internet giants at this week’s summit.

The top web firms have agreed to ask new customers if they want anti-porn filters by the end of the year - but this does extend to existing customers.

Baroness Benjamin asked: ‘Why is the government not insisting they should be offering filtering for their existing customers and block porn and adult material by default as part of the solution to protect all children before they end up in a moral wasteland?’

She said that children are particularly vulnerable from parent-less households and parents who do not care. ‘No amount of awareness education will do anything for these kids,’ she said.

Lord Nash replied: ‘The fact that it is so easy for our children to access these dreadful images is shocking.

‘We also want the ISPs to check that the person setting up the parental controls is over the age of 18. The five main domestic ISPs that cover 90 per cent of households in the UK have committed to ensure that these measures are in place for existing as well as new customers by the end of this year.’

He added that wi-fi in public places would soon also have automatic filters and work is under way to place parental controls on device manufacturers and retailers.
