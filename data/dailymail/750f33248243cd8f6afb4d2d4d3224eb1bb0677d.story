Cesc Fabregas admits he will always feel like a Gunner - despite a £30million move to Arsenal's London rivals Chelsea this summer.

The Spain playmaker has hit the ground running at Stamford Bridge, laying on four assists for his new team-mates already this season.

And - after leaving boyhood club Barcelona - Fabregas is looking forward to returning to his former north London stomping ground, albeit in the blue of Chelsea.

'I will always feel a Gunner and I know that I am going to return to [the Emirates Stadium] and I feel that it will be a special moment but I am committed,' Fabregas told El Pais.

'Remember that I played a Champions League final against Barcelona. I swear to you that I would have done anything to win that game even though I’d been Barcelona since I was a kid.

'So you know that when I play against Arsenal I will know who I am playing with, who my teammates are and who I will defend and I know that the Arsenal fans will understand; I have no doubt.'

The midfielder had a number of run-ins with Chelsea during his previous spell in England, and was more surprised than anyone to end up in blue.

He said: 'If you’d told me five years ago that I would play for Chelsea and Mourinho I would not have believed you, but life changes.

'I spoke with my agent and told him to find me a team. Chelsea’s offer arrived and for me it was about returning to London, the place where I did best.

'There was no better exit. I spoke with Mourinho and he told me things that I needed to hear. I felt valued, felt that I was going to be part of something important.'
