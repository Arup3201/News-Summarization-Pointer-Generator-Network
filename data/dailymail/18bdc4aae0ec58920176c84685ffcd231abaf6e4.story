The governor of Cuzco wants to open Machu Picchu for longer hours in a bid to attract an extra 5,000 tourists a day to the Inca site.

Rene Concha Lezama has suggested keeping the ruins open until 8pm daily in a bid to double the number of people who can visit the hilltop site.

The current opening hours are from 6am to 5pm and conservationists have already warned that the ruins are put under undue strain by the quantity of visitors, but Mr Lezama feels the extra three hours will help meet the huge demand from tourists.

The ruins, which were named one of the New Seven Wonders Of The World in 2007, currently undergo maintenance every day in a bid to prevent long-term damage by visitors.

But there are fears extra visitors could further damage the terraces, although it would also be a money-spinner for the nation.

Currently there is a limit of 2,500 people allowed at the site daily, but the extra three hours could see that number soar to as many as 5,000.

Regional director of tourism Luis Angel Aragón Carreño has led the call against extended opening hours.

He said: 'We must protect Machu Picchu and not just see the site as a goldmine.'

A total of 1.17 million tourists visited Machu Picchu in 2013, of which 804,000 were foreign visitors, and some have campaigned against the increasing number of tourists visiting the hilltop citadel.

In 2012 the World Heritage Committee was advised to consider adding Machu Picchu to the list of world heritage sites in danger.

A
 report at the time said that the 2,500 visitor limit had been exceeded 
on ‘numerous occasions’ and added that ‘the intention to increase the 
number of visitors to the property would further exacerbate existing 
problems.’

On the UNESCO World Heritage
 website, a statement reads: 'Tourism itself represents a double-edged 
sword by providing economic benefits but also by resulting in major 
cultural and ecological impacts.

'The
 strongly increasing number of visitors to the Historic Sanctuary of 
Machu Picchu must be matched by an adequate management regulating 
access, diversifying the offer and efforts to fully understand and 
minimize impacts.'

There are similar concerns over a new international airport close to the site in Cuzco which got the go ahead earlier this year.

Once the international airport is opened it will allow tourists to fly direct to the site, rather than arriving in Lima and taking an internal flight.

The
 current airport in Cuzco has a limit of two million tourists a year 
whereas the new hub will be able to welcome five million, and eventually
 up to eight million.

Locals
 are divided between those who fear their traditions are being eroded by
 the influx of foreign visitors and others who know the development is a
 boon for tourism.
