Rail passengers face fare rises of up to 11 per cent next year after a higher-than-expected jump in the inflation rate.

The increases will add hundreds of pounds to annual season tickets, with some commuters seeing season ticket fares to London crash through the £6,000 barrier.

And there is no end in sight to the inflation-busting hikes, as ministers admitted they will continue every year until at least 2015.

Rail passengers will be hit with another big increase on fares, this time as much as 11 per cent

Train company bosses, whose firms will
pocket much of the extra cash, passed the buck by insisting it was not 
their decision to hike the fares – it was government policy.

From next January 1, train firms can 
raise their ‘regulated’ fares – which include rush-hour commuter travel,
season tickets and off-peak fares – by three percentage points more 
than the RPI inflation figure for July, which was revealed yesterday as 
3.2 per cent.

That means commuter and other 
‘regulated’ fares will be allowed to rise by 6.2 per cent.

But the 
companies also have the flexibility to add another 5 per cent to respond
to changes in demand for particular services – meaning some fares could
rise by 11.2 per cent.

If they do so, they will have to make fare cuts elsewhere in compensation.

Ministers said the extra cash from fare-payers was needed to fund billions of pounds of rail investment.

But passenger groups, campaigners and unions said it was a ‘rip-off’ and yet another ‘Great Train Robbery’ that would benefit only rail bosses and their bonus pots at the expense of hard-pressed travellers and commuters.

Rail fares have risen by more than inflation every year for the past ten years.

Rail passenger groups, transport campaigners and unions yesterday held protests at more than 40 stations.

They called on Transport Secretary Justine Greening to rein back on the rises, which come at a time when Britain has some of the highest fares in Europe and when passengers spend up to 15 per cent of their income on commuting.

The Campaign for Better Transport said commuters from Ashford International in Kent could see their annual fare rise to £4,872 from next year, a £284 increase.

Those commuting from Bournemouth face a £356 rise to £6,104.

A season ticket from Manchester to Liverpool will increase by £167 to £2,855; Newcastle to York will rise by £331 to £5,663; Bristol to Swindon will go up by £183 to £3,127; and Leeds to Sheffield by £133 to £2,281.

By 2015 the annual cost of commuting to London from Birmingham will have soared from £9,004 to £10,663, which accounts for 28 per cent of the average London salary, says the campaign group.

The group’s chief executive Stephen 
Joseph said: ‘If the Government sticks by its policy, rail fares will 
rise three times faster than salaries. With the economy flat-lining, 
this is untenable. Our railways need to be affordable to ordinary 
people, not just “train-toffs” on high incomes.’

Miss
Greening said she would try to persuade the Chancellor to cut the 
‘inflation plus 3 per cent’ formula down to ‘inflation plus 1 per cent’ 
for the next two years. Treasury sources indicated last night that there
was no scope to make the cut.

Bob Crow, leader of the Rail Maritime and Transport union, said: ‘This is a bigger rip-off than the Great Train Robbery.

‘This money will not be invested back in services, it will be trousered by the greedy train operators.’

Michael
Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating 
Companies, said: ‘The Government decides the average increase of 
commuter ticket prices and other regulated fares which train companies 
will be required to introduce in January.’

The
row comes as Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Rail Group is expected to 
lose its franchise to run the West Coast mainline to arch-rival First 
Group, which is understood to have offered up to £7billion for a 14-year
contract.
