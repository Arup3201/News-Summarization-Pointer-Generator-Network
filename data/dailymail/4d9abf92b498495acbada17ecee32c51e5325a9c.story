The unusual combination of 2012 
apocalypse fears, popular killer-zombie shows and the potential 
re-election of President Obama has led to a nationwide spike in gun 
sales.

A similar increase 
was noted in 2009 during President Obama's first term and gun dealers 
and buyers say they fear what a second term lame duck Obama 
administration may do.

Sales
have increased to such an extent that manufacturers such as Sturm, 
Ruger & Co. are struggling to keep up with the demand.

Record year so far: Sales of firearms have increased so much that manufacturers are struggling to keep up with the demand

The
Southport, Connecticut-based company has suspended new orders after 
taking over one million requests for guns in the first three months of 
this year.

'Sales usually 
increase this time of year with tax returns, but this year has been 
higher than most,' said Mike Weeks, owner of Georgia Gun Store in 
Gainesville, Georgia.

'People are scared their gun rights are going to be curtailed after the election.'

Firearms saw a similar boost in sales during the early months of President Obama's first term in 2009

This follows a record 2011, when nearly 11 million firearms were sold in the U.S according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation.

The $4 billion guns and ammo industry in America has been one sector that has bucked the depressed economic trend since 2008.

Noting his own sales have risen by around 30 per cent, Mr Weeks now says that he sells ammo by the case.

'Usually
people come in to buy three or four boxes for target practice. Now they
are coming in asking what kind of deals they could get on a case,' said
Mr  Weeks.

The common denominator in these increases according to industry experts is the looming November 6 election.

'It’s definitely the election year,' said Jason Hanson, a former CIA officer and personal security specialist to FoxNews.com.

'People feel that Obama will serve a second term and with it their gun rights taken away, so they are stocking up.

'They’re also worried that the economy is not getting any better and that they need to protect themselves.'

Upon
President Obama taking office in 2009 firearm enthusiasts have rushed 
to dealers worried he would tighten gun control and sales have continued
to grow during his term as President.

While
campaigning for office as in 2008 he famously told 
fundraisers of his frustration that Midwestern and Rust-Belt voters 
'cling to guns or religion' and many supporters of the Second Ammendment
doubt he is fully behind it.

'He's never been pro-gun,' explained Cris Parsons of his thoughts on President Obama.

Mr Parsons, 31, runs a Texas gun depository called the Houston Armory.

To
date, explains Parsons, the President has been 'pretty coy' regarding 
guns and the gun dealer feels this will remain the case during the 
campaign.

If President Obama was to adopt a contrary position Mr Parsons reckons it will 'upset a lot of people.'

As a backdrop to this, gun makers stocks are rising.

Sturm, Ruger & Co's share price has risen 55 percent this year and Smith & Wesson is up 91 percent.

A strong litmus test for U.S gun sales is the FBI's National Instant Background Check System.

Firearm enthusiasts contributed record sales to the $4 billion industry last year

This allows federally licensed firearm dealers to conduct mandatory background checks on purchasers of new and used weapons.

Statistics up until December 2011 indicated a 19th straight month of background check increases year on year.

November 25, 2011, saw the record for most background checks in one day --129,166 and became known as 'Black Friday'.

However politics aside there are other explanations for the current boom.

'There're the 'preppers,' explained Parsons, 'and then there's this whole Zombie Apocalypse thing.'

An entire industry has grown up around preppers and the fear of ancient Mayan prophecies predicting the end of the world.

As
many as three million Americans now count themselves in that category 
buying up guns, ammo and food in anticipation of a solar flare or 
catastrophic asteroid hit before the year is out.

Ready for anything: There are an estimated three million preppers in the United States alone

A
staggering 61 per cent of 1,000 polled by the National Geographic 
channel believe there will be a catastrophic event in the next 20 years,
and people want to be prepared.

Combined
with the preppers is the growth in popularity of Zombie shows such as 
'The Walking Dead' which has led firearms manufacturers to produce 
themed guns and bullets.

'We can't keep it in stock,' explained Cris Parsons of his line of Zombie Max ammunition.

'It comes in a cool, colorful box with a Zombie on it.'

However, in reality business is booming for the American firearms industry.

'There’s
a lot of speculation that the Second Amendment will be affected by the 
next presidential term,' said Bret Jordan, a stock analyst specialising 
in firearms to FoxNews.com.

'There
was one investors' call and an executive was asked what he thought would
happen if Obama was elected a second term and he said, "No one in the 
gun industry will tell you they like Obama, but everyone will vote for 
him."'
