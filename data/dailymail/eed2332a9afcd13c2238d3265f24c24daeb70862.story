Angry mothers staged a mass breastfeeding protest today in a Sports Direct store that asked a woman who was feeding her child to leave because it was against company policy.

Around 70 women descended on the shop in Nottingham city centre to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son.

Mrs Komar had been sitting on a bench inside the store waiting for her father Edward Morawiec, 63, who was trying on a T-shirts.

But she claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'.

The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room.

Other customers then took pity on the mother-of-two and helped her to push her buggy outside so she could continue feeding Daniel.

Mrs Komar claims she has complained to the store five times since the incident in January but has had no response, although it is believed the firm has now issued her with an apology.

But other mothers, who wanted to show solidarity with Mrs Komar, went to the Sports Direct store today and said they were defending their right to breastfeed in public places.

Organiser of the protest Leah Gibson said: ' We’re here today to stand up for breastfeeding women and their right to feed their children in public without being asked to leave places.

'The turn-out has been fantastic, probably more than I expected. It’s been really peaceful and calm, which is exactly what we wanted.

'We just wanted to show everyone that we can feed in peace, without showing everyone our boobs.

'It’s shocking that we’ve still got this sexual ‘thing’ about boobs.

'Breasts were made to feed a child and to nourish. Only 1 per cent of the population can’t physically feed their child this way so when you look at it like that, it shows you what they are for.

'Some mothers say "oh I don’t want to feed my baby because my boobs are for my partner". No, they aren’t - they’re for your child.'

The group spent around 15 minutes in the shop and organisers confirmed there were no issues with Sports Direct staff on this occasion.

Mrs Komar lives in Boston, Lincolnshire, with her husband Zbigniew, 33, and their sons Wictor, two, and Daniel, who is now five-months-old.

She had travelled to Nottingham for a weekend shopping with Daniel and her father Edward as a Christmas present from her husband when they visited Sports Direct.

Speaking at the time she said: 'Midwives and doctors say that it (breastfeeding) is best for the child but I feel so upset and frustrated about what has happened.

'I can't understand why a baby has to be punished for being hungry and why I need to feel like a criminal when I just want to feed my baby son.'

Mrs Komar also received support from other mothers including Laura Whatton - who was ejected from the John Carroll Leisure Centre in Nottingham in 2009.

Mrs Whatton, reacted by saying: 'I'm not surprised really.

'Everyone is prudish toward it, even though it's the most natural thing in the world.'

Patti Rundall, policy director for Baby Milk Action, explained: 'All mothers have a legally-protected right to breastfeed in public.

'It is important, it's their right and we will do what we can to support them.'

Mrs Komar's experience is the latest in a number of incidents where mothers have been told to stop breastfeeding in public.

In March, Heather Vaughan, 29, told how she was reduced to tears when staff at a naval museum ordered her to stop feeding her baby in its creche, telling her 'we don’t do that here'.

The mother-of-two said she felt victimised and humiliated at the museum in the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Bosses apologised, saying it had simply been an 'error of judgment'.

Last 
October, a midwife spoke out after she was told to stop breastfeeding in
 a public swimming pool because the lifeguard thought it was 
'offensive'.

Sophie
 Howes was sat on the steps of the learner pool with her eight-month-old
 daughter Connie at a leisure centre in Ashford, Kent, when she was 
ordered to move.

The manager of the centre claims that CCTV footage shows Ms Howes breastfeeding Connie while the baby's head was level with the water in the pool.

But the mother said: 'It is irrelevant whether I was in the water or not because that is not what the staff member said to me to begin with.

'She didn't mention health and safety issues, she just said one of her colleagues had been offended by me breastfeeding.'

She has now won an undisclosed pay out from the Ashford Leisure Trust, who run the leisure centre, after they agreed an out of court settlement.

The Equality Act 2010 states that it is discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding.

The act protects women who want to do so in shops or other public places.
