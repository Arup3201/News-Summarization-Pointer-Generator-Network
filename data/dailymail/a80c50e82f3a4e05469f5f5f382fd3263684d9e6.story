Facing charges: Amanda Feenstra conducted a relationship with one of her female students for over a year after inviting her over while her husband was away

A former dance teacher is due in court after she allegedly had sex with one of her students.

Amanda Feenstra, 30, was arrested after the girl, who was 17 at the time, told police that the pair had sex 'so many times she cannot 
remember'.

The encounters allegedly took place at Feenstra's house but also at the school office of her dance team, the 'Wild Cadets', at Humble High School in Houston, Texas, and at various sporting events.Â 

The alleged relationship lasted over a year, from August 2010 to November 2011, before the teacher started 'stalking' the girl and she was reported to police.

The student started staying over in Feenstra's guest room while the teacher's husband was away.

Feenstra now faces charges of an improper relationship with a student after the girl complained in September 2012 that Feenstra has been constantly  calling her since she tried to end their relationship and turning up to her work place.

School officials said that the girl 'felt embarrassed and trapped' and 'had lost all her friends' over the course of the relationship.

They said it was her embarrassment that had prevented her from speaking up earlier.

The student explained that 'she tried to get away from the defendant and thought graduating was her way out', only to find Feenstra 'stalking her' after she left.

Feenstra is out on a $30,000 bond.
