Al Qaeda-linked militants have taken control of Iraq's strategic city of Fallujah, it has emerged.

It is the latest in a series of protests by Sunni Arabs who claim to be marginalised by the Shia-led government.

Fighting broke out on Thursday after army troops disbanded a Sunni protest camp in nearby capital of the Levant province, Ramadi.

Response: The Iraqi army is surrounding Fallujah, and has deployed tanks and artillery ahead of an all-out military assault to retake the city

Iraqi troops and allied tribesmen surrounded the city on Wednesday, firing artillery at up to 150 militants, an anonymous military official said.

On Saturday, police abandoned the city and have now taken up posts on the outskirts to prevent the fighters roaming further.

Hadi Razeij, head of the Anbar police force, told Arabic language broadcaster al-Arabiya: 'The walls of the city are in the hands of the police force, but the people of Fallujah are the prisoners of ISIL.'

Fallujah and Ramadi were strongholds of Sunni insurgents during the US-led war.

In a speech in Baghdad, prime minister Nouri al-Maliki said government forces would press on to clear the province of militants.

'There will be no retreat until we eliminate this gang and rid the people of Anbar of their evil acts,' he said.

'The people of Anbar asked the government for help, they called us to come to rescue them from terrorists.'

Anger was exacerbated over the past week after authorities arrested a senior Sunni politician and dismantled a months-old sit-in in Ramadi.

In an attempt to calm the situation, al-Maliki pulled some military out to give local police security duties - a top demand of Sunnis.

But after the uprising, the military rushed reinforcements back in - a move supported by allied Sunni tribal fighters.

Government official Dhari al-Rishawi said clashes - some of the worst in five years - were still underway, adding militants remain in control of Fallujah and some parts of Ramadi, Anbar's capital.
