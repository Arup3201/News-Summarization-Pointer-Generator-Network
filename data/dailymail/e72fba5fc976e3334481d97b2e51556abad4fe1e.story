Good manners cost nothing but bad ones could cost you a dollop of food in the face, as this new video shows.

Dylan Steinberg, 27, filmed the moment one of his friends tried to pull off the ice cream 'coning' prank at a McDonald's drive-thru in Cinnaminson, New Jersey. 

The bizarre stunt involves grabbing the frosty treat by the ice cream end instead of the cone.

However, footage shows the employee quickly cottons on to the trick. He is heard warning the giggly blonde woman: 'I don't know what you think you're doing but I can actually mush this in your face.' 

'I've seen this stunt before,' he adds unimpressed.

The unidentified woman pretends that she doesn't know what's going on.

'Excuse me?' she splutters before throwing a mischievous look at the camera.

The McDonald's employee gives her an ultimatum; either she takes the ice cream the correct way or he'll throw it away.

'You really wanna grab it by the bottom or not?' he sternly asks.

The woman then takes both ice creams from the McDonald's server the correct way with a big grin on her face.

'Thank you... I really don't understand,' she says innocently. 

To date the clip of the failed 'coning' prank has been watched more than 140,000 times. 

Many viewers have applauded the McDonald's worker for putting the prankster in her place.

It's not known if he lost his job as a result of the clip, which was posted online in 2011 but only recently resurfaced.
