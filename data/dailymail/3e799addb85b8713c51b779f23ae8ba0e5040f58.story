For most people, university is the perfect time for meeting new people and having wild, one-off experiences.

But a worrying trend reported by The Debrief has found that such experiences are putting hundreds of students health at risk, as a shocking number are choosing to have unprotected sex.

One 20-year-old Exeter student even admitted to the website that she’d had unprotected sex with a fellow student knowing he had chlamydia.

Ready for bed? University students are shunning condoms in favour of 'nights of passion'

‘He was completely honest about contracting the disease – we were even joking about it that night – but I just let the passion get the better of me,’ said the woman, who wished to remain anonymous.

‘I knew that it was easy to treat and that there was a chance I wouldn’t get it at all, so I just thought “f**** it”.

‘I was pretty wasted at the time, which didn’t help.

‘Now that I look back, I can’t believe how reckless I was – what if he had something else?’

It might seem shocking, but she is not the only student risking their health for a night of passion.

Online pharmacy www.UKMedix.com carried out research last week stating that 19 per cent of 18 to 30-year-olds would have sex with someone knowing that their potential partner had an STI.

And, 39 per cent of these people claim they already have had unprotected sex with someone with an STI.

Another 26 per cent explained they would be happy to have sex with someone with an STI because if they used protection it would be, ‘impossible to catch it’.

Some 11 per cent explained they would still have sex because they ‘always let passion get the better of them.’

Furthermore, another recent study has found that 39% of students at the prestigious Oxford University have willingly had unprotected sex.

But what’s brought on this sudden disregard for safe sex?

Many students at UK universities say they'd have sex with someone knowing the potential partner had an STI

‘We see a lot of university students,’ Victoria Leonard, Nurse manager for young persons’ health service Brook in Salford and Bolton told The Debrief.

‘The number of people who have come into our services enquiring about STI testing has actually decreased in the last year, but the number of tests which come back positive has increased from 6.8% to 7.6% in only a year.

‘That’s a worrying trend.’

Linda Ahearne, who manages the sexual 
health clinic at the London College of Arts, claims there is a ‘massive 
STI problem,’ among students, despite raised awareness and publicity.

‘I suspect that STIs have increased amongst students in the last couple of years,’ she said.

‘Despite
 all the publicity and help available, students seem to be having more 
unprotected sex and are slow to get tested when they have.'

William Wright – a 19-year-old first year
 ergonomics student at Loughborough University – told The Debrief that 
having unprotected sex with a girl was the equivalent of getting a 
trophy.

‘I never wear condoms, and neither do most of the guys I know,’ he said.

‘A lot of guys I know from uni brag about not using condoms when they have sex with a girl.

‘It’s mainly because they’re uncomfortable and make you lose sensation.

‘Also, there’s nothing more unnatural than stopping stuff with a girl to strap on a bit of latex.

‘Some girls do make a point of asking, but not that many of them insist on it.

‘The way I see it, everything is so easy to treat these days that it’s not that big of a deal if you contract an STI.'

How will I know if I've got an STI?Different STIs have very different symptoms. And some have no symptoms at all. But if you can see or feel symptoms, these can include an unusual discharge from the vagina or penis, heavy periods or bleeding between periods, pain or burning sensation when passing urine, rashes, itching or tingling around the genitals or anus. What does a test involve?Tests for STIs vary. Lots of services also offer urine testing, some can mean just taking a swab from the cervix or tip of the penis. Sometimes you can swab yourself, other times a doctor or nurse will do the swab. Others involve taking a blood sample. Your health advisor can talk you through what will happen with the tests and anything you are worried about. Can you get sexually transmitted infections from oral sex?Yes. Some STIs, including Chlamydia, Genital Herpes, Gonorrhoea, Genital Warts and HIV, are passed on through oral sex. To reduce the risk of infection, use a condom for oral sex.

What happens if the test says I have an STI?Your clinic will encourage you to talk to your current partner and sometimes to your previous partners. This is so they can also be tested. And remember, most STIs are treatable with antibiotics. How can I protect myself from STIs?The best form of protection is to use a condom. And you can use a condom with any other form of contraception for the ultimate in safer sex.
