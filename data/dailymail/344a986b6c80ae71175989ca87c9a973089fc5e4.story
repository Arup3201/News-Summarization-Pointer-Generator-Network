Twelve young people - some of whom were feared to be dead - have been found by authorities investigating the horrific ‘house of horrors’ basement where four disabled victims were kept in chains.

The eight children and four young adults are said to be related to victims or suspects in the case in Philadelphia. The FBI and police are trying to locate up to 50 victims in the alleged kidnapping ring.

The young people, who showed signs of abuse and malnutrition, have been taken into protective care - and police believe the ring spanned Texas, North Carolina, Florida, Virginia and Pennsylvania.

Horror chamber: The dark and filthy basement in Philadelphia where four disabled people were kept chained to pipes and made to use buckets as toilets

It's the latest twist in the 
extraordinary story of the filthy basement where the victims were kept 
chained to a boiler, which reeked of waste from the buckets they used to
relieve themselves.

Linda Ann Weston, 51, her boyfriend 
Gregory Thomas, 47, her daughter Jean McIntosh, 32, and Eddie Wright, 50, allegedly locked up Derwin 
McLemire, 41, Herbert Knowles, 40, Tamara Breeden, 29, and Edwin Sanabria, 31.

Authorities believe the alleged theft 
scheme involved more victims and the gang were keeping the four mentally
disabled adults in squalor while wresting control of their Social 
Security cheques.

A 19-year-old found among the young people is Beatrice Weston - niece of the alleged ringleader.

She was missing for two years and is said to have been 
physically abused. Police said she has burn marks suggesting she was scolded with a hot spoon and had
pellet gun wounds.

The case could be among the first of its kind prosecuted as a federal hate crime.

The law was recently expanded to include victims with disabilities and the FBI is taking a broad look at the complex case, an official said.

The 2009 Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes Prevention Act is named for two victims of notorious hate killings and expands earlier federal hate-crimes law to include sexual orientation or disability and other things.

The law has been used sparingly since its passage. The first to go to trial was the case of Frankie Mayberry, of Green Forest, Arkansas, who was convicted in May of attacking a car last year with five Hispanic men inside it.

‘She is in very, very poor condition,’
Philadelphia Police Lieutenant Ray Evers told WPVI. ‘She has lost a lot
of weight. She has newer injuries, definitely some older injuries, a 
lot of scarring.’

Two of the children recovered are 
believed to have been those of Ms Breeden and they are anticipated to be
reunited with the mother later this week, reported WPVI.

Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey 
described a ‘very complicated case’ and a ‘very sad story’. ‘It makes no
sense,’ he said. ‘When you look at the kids, the psychological trauma 
is pretty apparent.’

Earlier on Tuesday it was revealed a 
teenage girl missing since July - from an area in Florida where 
neighbours said the suspects had come from earlier this month - 
was located in Philadelphia.

Found: Benita Rodriguez, 15, who was missing since July 4 from West Palm Beach, Florida, has also been located by Philadelphia police. Her boyfriend's father is one of the four suspects - Gregory Thomas

Three of the four victims spoke out of
their horror at being locked up in a low-ceiling, dank room that 
contained a mattress with bedding and a flat board with a pillow and a 
boiler.

The squalid conditions of the 
sub-basement were revealed behind a locked door under apartments in the 
city's Tacony neighbourhood. There were a few water bottles but no food.

And on Tuesday it was revealed Benita 
Rodriguez, 15, who was missing since July from West Palm Beach in 
Florida, where neighbours said the group had come from, was found by 
police.

The girl's mother said the 15-year-old
had been friends with one of the suspect's sons, Gregory Thomas Jr, and
was reportedly found by Philadelphia police on Monday with three of the suspects.

and details surrounding her connection to the case are sketchy, with 
police not yet sure how much she knew about the 'house of horrors'.

Held captive: Herbert Knowles went missing from his home in Norfolk, Virginia three years ago

The identity of one of the four 
disabled victims was revealed earlier this week as Herbert Knowles, 40, 
who went missing three years ago from his home in Norfolk, Virginia.

The family of Mr Knowles said he moved
in with a girlfriend and her mother - the suspect Weston - three years 
ago. That was the last time they heard from him until he was rescued at 
the weekend.

His niece Tiffany Davis told Wavy TV: 
They describe him as if he was some kind of animal. You got him chained 
in the basement. All the lights are out. There are buckets for him to 
use the bathroom.'

Derwin McLemire, 41, another victim, 
told KYW: 'That was real dirty of you. That was wrong.' The North 
Carolina man said he unsuccessfully tried to escape from Weston's home 
‘so they got me'.

Mr McLemire had forgotten what day it 
was. 'I got a birthday coming up Friday and I didn’t even know it was 
coming up,' he told CBS Philly. He said of Weston: 'She wouldn’t let me 
do nothing.'

A third victim was identified by 
Tamara Breeden. She alleged to KYW that she was hit in the head by 
Weston and 'all this was bleeding and everything'. The fourth victim was Edwin Sanabria, 31.

Locked in: There are fears that the four found in Philadelphia are just some of many across the country being kidnapped for money and held captive

Ms Breeden, 29, was reported missing 
six years ago - but the case was reportedly closed by police last year 
in Philadelphia even though detectives had not found her, reported 
myFOXphilly.com.

Victim Derwin McLemire

The four suspects have been charged 
with kidnapping and other related offences, and Weston, Thomas and Wright are all being held 
on $2.5million bail each. Those three were arrested on Monday. McIntosh was arrested on Wednesday.

Lieutenant Ray Evers said: 'Without a 
doubt. This is just the beginning of this investigation. We think she's 
been doing this for quite some time.'

Authorities in at least two states missed opportunities to help the disabled adults. Weston was legally disqualified from cashing the victims' government disability cheques because of her criminal past.

But she apparently did anyway - enabled in part by a lack of accountability and follow-through by government agencies and police in Philadelphia and West Palm Beach, Florida.

The 'dungeon', as it was described by officials, was littered with bottles, blankets and clothing items.

The
four captives, who are said to have the mental age of a ten-year-old, 
were taken to Frankford Hospital and have since been discharged to a 
group home, where they were being looked after.

Police said they were malnourished and some had bruises and bed sores. At least one was kept chained to a pipe in the room.

They are thought to have been held captive for more than a year. It was also revealed that Weston, the
alleged ringleader of the gang, had previously served eight years for 
starving someone to death.

She
was convicted of starving Bernardo Ramos, 25, to death after he refused
to support her sister's unborn child, the Philadelphia Inquirer 
reported.

Meanwhile police in Virginia confirmed they investigated the 2008 death of a woman living with Weston, who cleared out of the Norfolk home hours after calling police about the death.

A death certificate says Maxine Lee, 39, died of meningitis but also suffered from a wasting disease.

Vicious crime: Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey stands by the entrance to the dank basement room where four people were held against their will

Police said while officers were in the
basement of the eight-unit apartment building, they heard a noise 
behind a locked steel door that sounded like a dog.

'This case just makes you shake your head; it's despicable and unspeakable'

Philadelphia Police Deputy Commissioner Richard Ross

The 
door was opened to reveal four people in a room not tall enough for an adult to stand up straight in. It was not clear how the suspects know the victims.

On Saturday night, evidence 
technicians carted out several feet of chains from the basement of the 
apartment building.

One emergency responder overheard some of the captives say they were handing over their government cheques to a caretaker.

Charged: Gregory Thomas, 47, (left) and Eddie Wright, 49, (right) are also accused of stealing the victims' Social Security cheques

The police said getting information 
from the victims had been difficult due to their disabilities, but they 
apparently had been brought to Philadelphia about ten days before they 
were found.

lands in your front door, it's really heartbreaking. It's so sad - these
are human beings'

They had apparently been in West Palm Beach, Florida, and 
before that in Texas.

Philadelphia Police Deputy 
Commissioner Richard Ross said: 'This case just makes you shake your 
head; it's despicable and unspeakable.

'When you look at the conditions under which they were kept, it's something out of a dungeon actually.'

Joan Sendef, who lives several blocks away, told the Philly News: 'You think you've seen it all. When it lands in your front door, it's really heartbreaking. It's so sad - these are human beings.'
