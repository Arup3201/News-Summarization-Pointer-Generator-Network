Republicans may have overtaken Congress with the mid-term elections, but President Obama has made it known that he will make sure immigration reform happens during his next last years in the White House - even if that means taking executive action.

On Sunday, former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney warned the president against passing reform on his own, saying the results of the recent elections show Americans are not in favor of his policies.

'My advice to the Democrats at this point and to the president in particular is to take a breath. The president said that he was not on the ballot in the election that was just held, but that his policies were. And the American people sent a very clear message to the president about his policies. They're not happy with them,' Romney said Sunday on Face the Nation.

Romney went on to call executive action an 'extra-constitutional' move that would just be 'poking an eye of the Republican leaders in Congress'. 

'The president has got to learn that he lost this last election round, the American people spoke loud and clear. Let those people who were elected come together with a piece of legislation on this and other topics, and then he has a chance to veto them if he doesn't like them. But the idea of violating the principles of our constitution, which is a balance of power, checks and balances, that is something which is wrong,' Romney, former governor of Utah, said.

Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri criticized Romney calling executive action a 'poke in the eye', saying it is the Republican party that has brought the issue to a standstill - while also admitting she's 'not crazy' about executive action. 

Continuing issue: Immigration reform came to the forefront earlier this year when masses of unaccompanied minors started crossing the border,overwhelming southern border patrol officers unsure what to do with the children.

'I'll tell you what a poke in the eye is,' McCaskill said. "A poke in the eye is for the United States Senate, almost a year and a half ago, passing by a two-thirds majority a comprehensive immigration bill with Republicans voting for it from places like Tennessee and South Carolina that just got reelected by double digits. And Speaker Boehner has refused to debate one of the most complicated and difficult problems facing our country. They won't take our bill up.'

'All he has to do next week if he doesn't want the president to act is take up the Senate bill,' McCaskill added. 'Amend it, change it, put up your own bill. Let's get back to doing our work instead of just blaming the president for everything.'

Last year, President Obama tried to make a change in immigration reform by supporting a bipartisan bill that was approved in the Senate. 

The bill focused on changing immigration policies to offer a route to citizenship for the approximate 11million undocumented workers already in the country. 

While that bill made it through the Senate, it still has not been brought up for a vote in the House. 

One of the fears if President Obama decides on executive action is whether House Republicans will shut the government down like they did over the budget for Obamacare last year.

However, Romney believes that method of blocking is unlikely.

'I think there's got to be more productive ways for us to be able to impress on the president the need to work for a permanent solution as opposed to a temporary stop-gap solution,' Romney said.
