Sitting on a fence and drinking Guinness, just two days ago David Cameron was back chillaxing at the pub where he left his eight-year-old daughter - and this time he remembered to take her home.

Obviously happy about having a Sunday drink, the Prime Minister was snapped in the garden of the Plough Inn, in Cadsden, Buckinghamshire, where in a blunder two months ago he had driven off without his eldest Nancy.

Mr Cameron was there with wife Samantha, and children Nancy, Arthur, six, and 22-month-old Florence, just a few miles from his country residence Chequers.

In a casual shirt, trousers and trainers, Mr Cameron is pictured standing surrounded by friends, children and his staff, including protection officers.

Rambler Robert Stone spotted Mr Cameron and decided to grab a picture when he and his wife stopped for a well-earned drink.

'We were about a quarter of the way through them and I turned to my missus and said, "That's David Cameron". He put down his rucksack and his missus turned up with the kids and it was clearly him,' he told the Mirror.

'There were some adults and a few more kids who sat near where we were sat and Mr Cameron was sat on the fence drinking his pint of Guinness.'

Yesterday it was revealed David Cameron mistakenly left his daughter in the pub and only realised she was missing when he 
arrived back at Chequers.

As they went to leave, Nancy went off to the toilet without telling them.

The
Prime Minister was driven back to Chequers, which is two miles from the
pub, with protection officers in one car, while Mrs Cameron drove their
other children in another.

Mr
Cameron presumed that Nancy was in the car with his wife, while she 
thought that their daughter had jumped in with the Prime Minister.

An insider said: 'It was a case of "Oh crikey I thought you had her" and "Oh crikey I thought YOU had her.'

A spokesman for the Prime Minister last night said he was ‘distraught’ when he realised what had happened.

They later confirmed that Mrs Cameron returned to the pub to pick up Nancy.

‘Thankfully
when they phoned the pub she was there safe and well,’ the spokesman 
said. ‘The Prime Minister went down straight away to get her.’

When
Mr Cameron arrived back at the pub he found his daughter happily 
helping the pub staff. It is understood she had been left by herself for
15 minutes.

Friends of Mr Cameron last month told how he enjoyed drinking ‘three or four glasses of wine’ over lunch at the weekend.

The revelations were in a biography that criticised the amount of time the Prime Minister spends ‘chillaxing’

The
book records weekends at Chequers singing karaoke, playing frames of 
snooker, and tennis against a machine dubbed ‘The Clegger’.

After long lunches the Prime Minister likes to recharge his batteries with an afternoon nap, the book claimed.

A source told the authors: ‘If there was an Olympic gold medal for ‘chillaxing’, the Prime Minister would win it.’

One
adviser claimed that the Prime Minister ‘spends a crazy, scary amount 
of time playing Fruit Ninja’, a computer game in which players use a 
cartoon sword to slash fast-moving fruit.

Mr Cameron has previously been branded ‘DVD Dave’ for his love of watching Danish dramas in bed with his wife Samantha.He also finds time for a weekly date night.

Plough
landlord Steve Hollings, who has run the pub with his wife Sharon for 
more than 13 years, said the Prime Minister and his family regularly pop
in for lunch or drinks.

Mr Hollings said Mr Cameron had again been in the pub with his family at lunchtime yesterday, and had spent about an hour there.

Speaking as he prepared the bar for the lunchtime rush, Mr Hollings confirmed that the incident happened 'some time ago.'

'It certainly wasn't this weekend, or three weeks ago as they are saying on TV,' he insisted.

Mr Hollings said: 'What do you want me to say? That he's a neglecting father? Well he's not.

'He's a great father and genuine family man and a genuine guy.

'I've only got good things to say about him.

'He's not the Prime Minister when he comes down here, he's just David Cameron, a family man.'
