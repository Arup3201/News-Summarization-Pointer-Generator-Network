German Shepherds are known for being bright animals - and one US policeman has demonstrated just how clever they are by teaching one to open and shut a patrol car door.

Video footage has re-emerged of a member of the Greenburgh Police Department's K-9 unit ordering his dog to perform the trick.

The clip begins with the pooch lying down in a car park.

German Shepherds are known for being eager to learn - and one US policeman has demonstrated just how clever they are by teaching one to open and shut a patrol car door

He can handle it: The dog sets about yanking open the passenger door

Jaw-some: The powerful dog pulls the door shut using a rubber hoop attached to the inside

The officer then simply points to the car and the animal hurries over to it.

It then immediately grabs the rear passenger door handle with its teeth and jumps in.

Attached to the inside of the door is a large rubber hoop, which the dog then tugs on to shut the door.

This is met with cries of delight from people watching behind the camera. The footage was filmed in 2009 but has since re-emerged on the internet and been viewed nearly a million times.

Hundreds of comments have been posted about the clip with many gobsmacked at what they've seen.

Obeymauri wrote 'that was cool and that's a smart dog', while Kath Sherman said 'it's an honor to salute them both'.

Its work done, the police dog sits inside the Greenburgh police patrol car
