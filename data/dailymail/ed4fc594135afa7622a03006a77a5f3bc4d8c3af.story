Bastia striker Brandao has been handed a six-month ban for his headbutt on Paris St Germain's Thiago Motta, the Ligue de Football Professionnel has announced.

Footage emerged of a clash between the two players in the tunnel shortly after PSG's 2-0 win at the Parc des Princes on August 16.

The video showed the veteran striker - in his debut season with the Corsican club - appearing to headbutt his opponent, an incident which left Motta with a broken nose.

PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi called straight away for Brandao to be banned for life and the LFP's Disciplinary Committee provisionally suspended the 34-year-old until September 18 pending a full hearing.

That hearing has resulted in the former St Etienne forward being handed a six-month suspension, meaning he will not be able to play until February 22 next year.

A statement read: "After hearing players Thiago Motta and Brandao accompanied by representatives of both clubs, the Commission imposes a six-month suspension on Brandao for his actions towards Thiago Motta. Brandao will be qualified to play again from February 22, 2015."

Brandao will now miss Bastia's next 21 Ligue 1 matches after making just two appearances for the club following his summer switch from the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.
