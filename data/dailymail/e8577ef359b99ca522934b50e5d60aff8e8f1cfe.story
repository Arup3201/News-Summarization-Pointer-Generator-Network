He has been linked with both Arsenal and Liverpool, La Liga side Valencia, as well as Italian outfits Fiorentina and Napoli.

Last week his agent revealed that Valbuena is considering leaving Marseille after the World Cup with France's concludes.

'He has a contract with Marseille and they are not a small club, they are a big club in France.' Jean-Pierre Bernes told French radio station Europe 1.

'But it is true that given his performances, and if there is the opportunity with a club, it is something we will examine and Marseille as well.

'Nothing is set, there is no destination fixed, there are contact with certain clubs in different European leagues.'

During his eight years at the south of France outfit, Valbuena has scored 38 goals in 332 appearances where he has won the 2009/10 Ligue 1 title as well as three Coupe de la Ligues.
