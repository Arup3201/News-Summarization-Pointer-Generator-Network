Dunga has named Luiz Adriano, scorer of five goals in Shakhtar Donetsk's 7-0 win over BATE Borisov, in his squad for November's games against Turkey and Austria.

The 27-year-old became only the second player to score five goals in a Champions League game on Tuesday night, Argentine Lionel Messi was the first.

His Shakhtar team mate Douglas Costa is also in the squad, alongside recalled Paris St. Germain pair Thiago Silva and Lucas Moura.

Chelsea trio Filipe Luis, Oscar and Willian are in the squad but Ramires misses out due to a groin injury. Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Manchester City's Fernandinho complete the Premier League contingent.

Kaka, Robinho, and goalkeeper Jefferson are among those who dropped out.

Brazil will face Turkey in Istanbul on November 12 and then travel to Austria for a match on November 18.
