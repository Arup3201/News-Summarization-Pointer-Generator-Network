The grandmother of schoolgirl Tia Sharp will face no further action from police in connection with her death.

Christine Sharp was arrested on August 10, on suspicion of murder after the 12-year-old's body was found in the loft of her home in The Lindens, New Addington.

Police today confirmed the 46-year-old had been released with no further action.

Ms Sharp's neighbour Paul Meehan remains on police bail.

The 39-year-old who was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, is bailed to return in mid-December.

Stuart Hazell, the partner of Tia's grandmother has been charged with her murder.

The 37-year-old of New Addington, will stand trial next May.

Police launched a 100-strong manhunt after the disappearance of Tia in August, with members of the public joining in with extensive searches to help find her.

Her body was eventually found wrapped in a sheet inside a plastic bag in the loft of her grandmother's home in New Addington, South London, more than a week after she went missing.

This was despite police visiting her grandmother's terraced property four times.Â 

Tia, who lived 10 miles away in Mitcham
 with her mother and her partner David 
would often spend weekends with her grandmother.

Tia's grandmother, Christine, 46, was arrested in connection with Tia's death and is on bail.

Christine's partner, Stuart Hazell, 37, is due to appear at the Old Bailey on November 19 accused of the child's murder.
