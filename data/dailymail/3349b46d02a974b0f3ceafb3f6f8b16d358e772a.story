The controversial badger cull has fallen so far short of its target that every animal killed has cost taxpayers more than £2,000, it is claimed.

Only 708 badgers, or 30 per cent of the population, have been killed in Gloucestershire, falling far short of the 70 per cent target.

And it emerged last week that  only 850 animals have been killed  in Somerset – the other area where the cull pilot is being carried out –  far fewer than the aim of 2,100.

The overall costs of the two culls, including policing animal rights protesters, is estimated by campaigners at some £3.5million.

Cull: The badger cull is costing £2,200 per animal killed. Only 30 per cent of Gloucestershire population have been killed - falling short of the 70 per cent target

With a total of 1,558 dead animals, this works out at £2,246 per badger.

In contrast, vaccinating badgers against bovine tuberculosis in Wales was less than a third of the cost at £662 per animal.

Campaigners warned that the  inability to meet targets could actually increase the spread of the  disease in cattle.

Ridiculed: Owen Patterson, Enviroment Secretary, was ridiculed for suggesting badgers had 'moved the goalposts'

Dominic Dyer, of charity Care for the Wild, said: ‘If the fact that this cull is morally and scientifically bankrupt isn’t enough, we’ve now got the fact that every badger killed so far has cost the British taxpayer around £2,200.

'To put that in perspective, the cost of each dead badger could provide a hospital bed for a week.

‘I don’t know how they can possibly kill enough badgers in the next three weeks in either zone to reach the total they want.

‘That means scientifically the cull can’t possibly have any positive impact on bovine TB – and will most likely make it worse.

‘They should stop now before this cull costs more lives and more taxpayers’ money for absolutely no reason.’

Experts
 have said that at least 70 per cent of badgers in an area must be 
killed in order to limit bovine TB – meaning that costs could spiral 
further if the cull is unsuccessful.

Environment
 secretary Owen Paterson yesterday denied the project was a failure but 
confirmed the cull companies would be seeking an eight-week extension so
 they could reduce animal numbers further. 

Last week, he was ridiculed for 
suggesting badgers had ‘moved the goalposts’ as he revealed the 
Government had reduced its cull target.

Campaign: Brian May, Queen guitarist and founder of Save Me, was one of the high-profile protestors against the badger cull
