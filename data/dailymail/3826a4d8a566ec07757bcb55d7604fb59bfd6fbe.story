Carlton Cole was left furious on Monday night as his move to West Bromwich Albion broke down at the 11th hour.

West Ham had given Cole permission to move to The Hawthorns and, after holding encouraging talks with manager Tony Pulis, the 31-year-old was looking forward to a new chapter in his career.

Pulis had earmarked Cole as a player of Premier League pedigree who could help younger team-mates to develop and replace Brown Ideye who is poised to join Al Gharafa.

However, West Ham called off the deal with an hour to go to deadline after Tottenham blocked a move for Emmanuel Adebayor and the Premier League blocked QPR's attempts to send Mauro Zarate back from his loan.

Cole was said to be upset and angry at the decision but had little choice with contracts yet to be exchanged.

Cole has found himself struggling to feature in Sam Allardyce's first-team plans this season, and has made only 14 appearances in all competitions, scoring just three goals, and was looking forward to getting more game time under Pulis.
