Nick Clegg has revealed plans for a career after politics as the new David Attenborough

He has often complained about the animal antics of MPs in Parliament.

But it seems Nick Clegg might not want to leave that all behind if he loses his seat at the election.

The Deputy Prime Minister has revealed plans for a career after politics as the new David Attenborough.

Asked about his future away from Westminster, the Lib Dem leader told Attitude magazine: ‘I’ve always wanted to make wildlife documentaries.’

Mr Clegg, who is already good friends with documentary maker Louis Theroux, faces a tough fight to keep hold of his Sheffield Hallam seat and polls have predicted his party could lose more than half of its MPs.

The Lib Dem leader demonstrated his love of the animal kingdom when he revealed one of this favourite moments in power was getting to feed a seal in Cornwall.

’It was brilliant,’ he told MailOnline last month. He sent a picture of his moment with the seal to his children, his parents, his whole family.

His baffled sister asked: ’Why is this the only picture you've emailed me of yourself in the last several months”.

But he insisted: ’I was so excited about that.’

David Cameron told Attitude, which conducted interviews with the all the main party leaders, he is a fan of the American indie rock band The War on Drugs.

He said: ‘[My wife] Samantha got me listening to a new thing called The War on Drugs. I can recommend it. They’re a band, you can find them on Spotify or iTunes – anyway, they’re good!’

Ed Miliband boasted of how singer Ellie Goulding last year asked him to one of her gigs.

He said: I’m an Ellie Goulding fan. She invited me to this benefit concert she was doing for the homeless just before Christmas. I really like her.’

Mr Cameron revealed that the LGBT figure he most admires is television presenter Clare Balding, who he said is a ‘wonderful human being’.

He said: ‘Everyone says [Enigma codebreaker] Alan Turing, and of course he was an amazing man and I’ve seen The Imitation Game and I thought it was brilliant, but I’m going to go with Clare Balding.

‘I’m a big fan. I love her enthusiasm; her zest for life. It doesn’t matter what sport she’s talking about, she can make it interesting. She’s a wonderful human being.’

As Deputy Prime Minister for the last five years he has toured the world, met the great and the good and been at the heart of an extraordinary experiment in coalition government but the thing he is most pleased to have done is feed a seal in Cornwall this month

The Prime Minister also told how he had raised the issue of gay rights with Russian President Vladimir Putin at 3am.

He said: ‘We raise these issues with every country, and I personally remember raising it in the middle of the night in a meeting with Vladimir Putin, at about 3 in the morning at the G20 he was chairing.

‘So we don’t hold back from raising... We recognise that some countries take a radically different approach, but we should tell them why we think we’ve got the right one.’

Nigel Farage talked about how he has spent time with ex-boxing promoter Kellie Maloney, formerly known as Frank, since she has been living as a woman.

The Ukip leader said it was ‘very interesting’ talking to the former Ukip candidate. He said: ‘I was friendly with Frank for a long time.

‘Since he’s changed to be Kellie, we have met, talked – very interesting conversation. Very interesting. It’s not a subject I know a huge amount about, but it was very interesting talking to Kellie.

‘There are lots of things in life that we’re curious about, and it’s not until you’ve talked to someone who’s been there that you get an inkling of how you might feel in a similar situation.

‘I think the Kellie story is a very interesting story which has caught the public imagination in a very big way. Quite unlike I’ve ever seen before.’

Mr Clegg revealed his dream to make wildlife documentaries like David Attenborough, who famously met gorillas in Rwanda in 1979

In a separate article for Countryside Alliance magazine, Mr Clegg told how spending time among wildlife in rural areas ‘lifts your heart’.

He wrote: ‘Rural Britain is what makes this country the envy of the world. From the beaches of St Ives to the rolling hills of Inverness, we are privileged to have on our doorsteps areas of outstanding natural beauty brimming with wildlife and warm communities who lift your heart whenever you visit.

‘There is no doubt that the British countryside has provided wealth, health and happiness for generations of Brits and tourists.’

Mr Cameron has often boasted about how his music collection is packed with trendy new bands and obscure artists, such as Swedish folk duo First Aid Kit.

But in January, he was left embarrassed after folk singer Nick Mulvey said he felt a ‘bit sick’ when he received the Prime Minister’s approval.
