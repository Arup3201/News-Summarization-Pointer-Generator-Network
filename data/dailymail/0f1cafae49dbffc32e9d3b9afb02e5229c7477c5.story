A California man accused of posing as an actor from the 'Twilight' movie franchise to lure young girls pleaded not guilty Tuesday to federal child pornography charges.

David LaVera, 33, appeared in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa, on charges of sexual exploitation of a child and possession of child pornography.

The bogus actor entered not guilty pleas to both counts against him. LaVera allegedly pretended to be Kiowa Gordon, 24, who played minor character Embry in three Twilight films.

Jasper County Sheriff John Halferty said LaVera has been turned over to U.S. marshals, Des Moines Register reported.

LaVera,
 of San Diego, already has pleaded not guilty to Iowa charges of sexual 
abuse, sexual exploitation of a minor, enticing a minor, carrying 
weapons and failure to have a valid driver's license.

He
 is also accused of using a smartphone to record a 12-year-old girl and a
 14-year-old taking a shower and using the bathroom. The lewd videos 
were then uploaded onto LaVera’s laptop, according to a criminal 
complaint.

The 33-year-old suspect will go on trial in the federal case beginning December 1.

Iowa prosecutors may dismiss state charges depending on the outcome of LaVera's federal trial, Judge Halferty said.

David LaVera was arrested in August 
after he allegedly convinced a 14-year-old girl to get into his car.  
The victim's sister called their mother to tell them the teen had left 
with LaVera. The mother, April Roush, called police. 

Mr 
LaVera and the teen were spotted on the outskirts of town by one of Ms 
Roush's friends, who stood in front of his car and demanded the girl 
come with her.

After she was safely out of LaVera's vehicle, he sped away. Sheriff's deputies caught up with him a short time later. In his car, they found two swords and four daggers.

Ms Roush credited her friend who rescued her daughter with saving the girl's life.

'I don't think I would have ever seen my daughter again. And if so, it would have been to bury her,' she told WHO. 

Ms
 Roush says she her daughter was so convinced that LaVera was the 
Twilight star that she still believes Kiowa Gordon was the one who came 
to pick her up.

He allegedly had chatted with the teenager over Facebook before driving 26 hours from California to Iowa to meet her.

Tammy Adams said that prior to this incident, LaVera also tried the same moves on her teenage daughter, Raven, on June 3.

Ms Adams told USA Today that LaVera told her daughter he was the Twilight star and convinced her and a friend to go to a park with him, where he touched her inappropriately.

The 33-year-old allegedly asked the teenager if they could meet up at night to make out. The girl planned to stay at a friend's and sneak out to meet him but her mother found out and called the police in Newton.

Raven Adams, who attends Berg Middle School, told USA Today: 'They didn't do anything about it. If they had, I don't think this would have happened to this other girl.'

After Tammy Adams contacted the police, an officer found LaVera at a bar and gave him a verbal warning but did not arrest him. He was allegedly signing autographs and taking pictures with his 'fans' at the time. 

Lt. Bill Henninger said in August he believed that LaVera had been introducing himself both by his real name but had convinced others, in particular groups of teenagers, that he was Kiowa Gordon and signing autographs in his name.

Raven Adams met the actor at her school on May 28 where he was brought by a parents of a student.

He was introduced to students as David LaVera, a stuntman from California, before he signed autographs and performed stunts at assembly.

On May 29, Raven Adams posted a pictured with the actor on her Facebook page. In the comments below, when asked who he was, she wrote: 'A guy that plays in twilight... he played embry call.'

One commenter wrote: 'And have you looked at a picture of embry from the movie... just looks diff.'

The teen replied: 'He is older it was like 5 and six years ago and he is a stunt double he filled in for the kne [sic] who broke his legs he was young tho.'

She added: 'He came to the school he is a family friend of a students his parents met him somewhere and they became really good friends.'

It is unclear, after being introduced as LaVera, how the man managed to convince the teenage girls that he was Kiowa Gordon.

According to the Internet Movie Database, LaVera has appeared in 13 movies, including  Die Fighting, Fortune 500 Man and a non-speaking role in Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull.
