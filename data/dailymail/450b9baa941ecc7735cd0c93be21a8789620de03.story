For decades climbing enthusiasts have sought to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Hilary and conquer the highest peak on Earth - Mount Everest.

But behind them, they have left a trail of destruction - creating an average of 50 tons of rubbish, including discarded oxygen canisters, climbing gear and food packaging, every year.

The problem escalated to the point where the fragile ecosystem of the Himalayas was under threat.

But after three years of hard graft in life-threatening conditions, a pioneering to team of clean up experts believe they are about to solve the mountain's pollution problem for good.

Clean up: A pioneering project has seen tonnes of hazardous rubbish brought down from the summit of Mount Everest

Intrusion: Piles of abandoned climbing gear and human waste has threatened to wipe out the Himalayan eco-system

Problem: This huge haul of discarded oxygen cylinders demonstrates the scale of rubbish dumping on Mount Everest

Hundreds of tons of human waste, abandoned climbing gear, tents, oxygen bottles, discarded food packing and even bodies littered the mountainside and threatened to destroy an entire eco-system just decades after mankind first reached it.

Villagers who have made their homes in the Himalayan slopes have had their isolated lives intruded on by wealthy westerners chasing fame and glory - and left with contaminated drinking and food supplies.

The problem forced the Nepalese government to react almost a decade ago, forcing Everest tourists to take responsibility for their gear having already paid a £45,000 premium to climb the mountain.

And a group of environmental volunteers orchestrated the Saving Mount Everest project to begin the unenviable mission to clean up the world's highest attraction.

Writer and environmental photographer Martin Edstrvm has worked with the group to capture the scale of the issue and revealed the changes that need to be made.

Martin said: 'The enormous growth in 
visitors has brought great strains on the natural environment and 
produced mountains of rubbish - from base camp and up to the high 'death
 zone'.

'In Sherpa villages along the trekking routes there has never been a sustainable waste disposal system in place.

'As
 50 tons of waste is left behind every season, the consequences have 
been an eyesore and a threat to the fragile environment.'

The overall goals of the project, 
which officially launched in 2010, are to conserve and manage the rich 
biological diversity of Nepal's Sagarmatha/Everest National Park.

The
 emphasis is on solid waste management and on supporting and 
strengthening local communities as the caretakers of biodiversity 
conservation.

End in sight: After three years of hard work collecting rubbish the team believe their project is nearing completion

Change needed: Campaigners will ask climbing groups to sign up to a Code of Conduct in future to safeguard the future of the mountain

After three 
years of death-defying work, scaling the treacherous peaks to clean up 
after others, the group are nearing completion.

They
 have pulled down almost 10 tons of hazardous trash from Everest's 
summit, introduced safe waste management techniques for local villages 
and tourists and installed at least 15 waste treatment facilities.

New era: The group have also introduced waste treatment facilities and safe waste management techniques to the local village

The
 project workers, led by Austrian Kurt Luger, have strived to implement a
 system of sustainable waste control and are taking the chance to finish
 their work in the current summer climbing season.

Kurt
 said: 'Our main focus is on improving the waste management situation in
 the Khumbu/Everest area and to raise awareness about it.

'Working
 with EcoHimal we support the local institutions in improving existing 
systems, a new incinerator is in use and porters, locals and school 
students get training on how to manage waste properly.

'We've
 also installed waste bins along the trails - the next step will be to 
co-finance public toilets for tourists and porters - as toilets either 
do not exist or currently in extremely poor condition.'

The
 project has now grown to bring together governments and organisations 
working for preserving the wilderness close to Nepal's greatest natural 
wonder.

The next decade will
 be challenging to preserve the groups' endeavours and ensure that all 
future summit parties adhere to a new Code of Conduct.

Phinjo
 Sherpa, director of EcoHimal, said: 'People are very quick to talk 
about the issue of waste in the mountains but nobody comes up with any 
proper solutions.

'We cannot
 afford to simply clean up Everest every now and then - we have to 
educate people about waste management and ensure it happens.'

The
 volunteers are working with the Nepalese government to issue stricter 
penalties for litterbugs - parties now have to sign a £2,500 deposit to 
ensure they return all the equipment they went up with.

But
 despite fears that tourists would permanently destroy Everest and the 
surrounding peaks, thousands of locals still rely on the economic boost 
they bring.

Threat: Around 50 tones of rubbish is left on Everest every climbing season

Eyesore: Just beyond the tourist trail lies a huge rubbish dump, right, but after three years of hard work the clean up is almost complete, left

Mountain guides and Sherpas make their living by leading expeditions to base camps and beyond, while entrepreneurs have set up small businesses to cater for seasonal climbers.

The greatest climber of all time Apa Sherpa, who was born and lived on the rocky outcrops for 44 years leading wealthy mountaineers to the top, insists that tourism is a great thing for the country.

Known as the 'Super Sherpa', Apa holds the record for climbing Everest an unsurpassable 21 times and has seen the effect of commercialisation on the local people.

Apa, 51, said: 'I met Sir Edmund Hillary and it was very special, he used to come every year to Nepal and even our school was built by him - he helped the country a lot. With schools, monasteries, clinics and health care.

'Sherpa culture is very good and we want to preserve it and the tourists that keep coming is a good thing for poor Sherpa people and people who live in Nepal. They bring money and give us jobs that we depend on to support our families.'

But Apa's views are not shared by everyone, as Buddhist leader Rimpuche Nawang Tenzing reveals the difficulties that have been brought by travellers.

His Holiness said: 'We almost never had a problem with waste. What waste we produced washed away with snow and rain.

'The waste of today - metal tins, paper and plastic - can't be taken away just by snow or rain.'
