This is the shocking moment a Russian schoolgirl was beaten up and forced to drink from a puddle by classmates who were 'jealous of her good looks'. 

Vlada Kholod, 13, was filmed being attacked by a gang of four girls at her school in Korkino in western Russia's Ural Mountains.

She was beaten up and forced to lie on a dirty road, before being made to drink filthy water from a puddle for 'being too pretty'.

Shockingly, the attack was videotaped by two schoolboys and later uploaded to the Russian social network, VKontakte.

However, after teachers saw the video, Vlada's attackers were reportedly reprimanded and forced to apologise to their victim.

The assault was carried out by Vlada's classmates, Olga Guseva, 16, Lyubov Goloborodko, 14, Sasha Rattsova, 15, and Ekatirina Streltsova, also 15.

They claimed the schoolgirl had said something derogatory about one of their parents - and that they had needed to set an example 'that nobody should curse 
somebody else's parents'.

However, Vlada later took to VKontakte to dispute claims that she had cursed one of their relatives.

Instead, she said she had been assaulted because Olga had been jealous about her boyfriend apparently looking at her.

Following her attackers' apology, Vlada verbally denounced the bullies in front of the entire school.

One of her friends said: 'She was very brave. She faced up to these bullies and they had to eat humble pie.'
