Dr Death: Teenage gym instructor Travis Barber was found dead after a violent reaction to the deadly ecstasy-type tablet

A 19-year-old gym instructor who died after taking an overdose of a super-strength Ecstasy drug known as ‘Dr Death’ was so badly injured that police thought he had been murdered.

Travis Barber suffered a violent reaction to the Class A drug and trashed the house he shared with his mother, ripping down curtains and tipping over tables before collapsing.

Dr Louise Barber found her son’s body in the dining room when she returned home to Salford after a weekend away. Travis was lying on his back with his fists and teeth clenched.

Yesterday, Dr Barber, 42, pleaded with young people not to play ‘Russian roulette’ with their lives by taking the drug.

A post-mortem found Travis had 62 separate injuries. It concluded he died of a massive overdose of Paramethoxyamphetamine, known as PMA. The concentration in his blood was the largest ever recorded, six times the fatal level.

After an inquest into her son’s death, Dr Barber said: ‘I would say [to young people] just don’t do it and please avoid all drugs, it’s like playing Russian roulette with your life, you just don’t know what is in the drugs. You think when you are young it will never happen to you, but it does.

‘Travis was kind, considerate and just a lovely, beautiful lad in every way. He loved his personal training and keeping fit. Travis loved music and playing the guitar and he was a wonderful son who was very much loved by his family, who are all  devastated by his death.’

PMA is similar to Ecstasy and often comes in pink, heart-shaped tablets. Police issued a warning to youngsters to be careful after it claimed the lives of five people in January alone.

The hearing was told that Travis, who was described as ‘very healthy and happy’, trained as a lifeguard before accepting a job as a fitness trainer at a gym in Stockport. But he started taking steroids to bulk up his muscles and confessed to his mother and girlfriend he had been experimenting with other drugs.

His girlfriend, Hayley Chaddock, told 
the inquest in Bolton: ‘We had a conversation one night about the 
different drugs he had tried. He took out a plastic bag with some 
tablets in. He didn’t take any when he was with me.

‘I wasn’t telling him off but I didn’t
 agree. I think he just thought he was alright and he was safe to take 
them. Obviously, no one is safe.’

Dr Barber said: ‘He told me he had 
tried it on three occasions. He didn’t say he was taking it regularly, 
just that he had experimented. We talked about the things that he had 
tried. I asked him to promise me that he would not take Ecstasy again. 
He did say he wouldn’t.’

Lethal dose: The deadly drug PMA responsible for the tragic death of teenage gym instructor Travis Barber

But he failed to heed his mother’s 
advice. A work colleague told the hearing that Travis took a tablet on 
Friday, February 15, after finishing his shift. Dr Barber found his body
 two days later, when she returned home from a weekend in London.

She found drug paraphernalia under his
 bed, including cannabis, cigarette papers, Tamoxifen tablets and 
needles. Pills and powder were found in the boot of his car.

Julie Evans, a consultant forensic 
toxicologist, said Travis may have accidentally overdosed on PMA because
 it is much slower to take effect than normal Ecstasy – but it is around
 five times as strong.

She said: ‘If you are used to Ecstasy, you could just take an extra tablet or two thinking that the pill is low-strength.’

Recording a narrative verdict, Alan 
Walsh, deputy coroner of Bolton, said Travis’ death exposed a ‘grave 
tragedy and grave problem with the drug industry.’

‘Travis got himself into this 
situation by experimenting with this drug,’ he added. ‘He was a healthy 
young man with a large number of friends who was respected by his peers 
and clients. I see a young man with great potential. Any drug is 
unlawful and any drug that is unlawful should not be used.’

PMA, nicknamed Dr Death for its lethal side-effects, has claimed the lives of ten young people within a 60-mile radius of Manchester since January.

The pills, which are available for as little as £3 each, are sometimes pink and shaped like Love Hearts sweets, or stamped with an ‘M’.

The amphetamine is also known as pink ecstasy, but it contains a different active ingredient which makes it as much as five times stronger.

PMA also takes longer to have an effect than ecstasy which means some users take more and unwittingly give themselves fatal overdoses.

The youngest victim was  16-year-old Ellie Jones, who died after suffering breathing difficulties at a friend’s house in Warrington.

PMA has also been linked  to the deaths of eight revellers in Canada and there have been other deaths in Norway and Denmark.
