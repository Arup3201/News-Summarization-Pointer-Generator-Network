A man in Massachusetts says all he heard was a hiss before a bobcat pounced on him in his own garage, sinking its teeth into his face and its claws in his back.

Roger Mundell Jr, 53, went into the garage in Brookfield on Sunday morning to fetch some tie-down straps for a friend when the rabid animal attacked.

It then ran out of the garage and bit Mundell's 15-year-old nephew on the arms and back. Mundell and his wife pinned the cat to the ground and shot it dead.

'Bleeding like crazy': Roger Mundell Jr. was scratched on his face and back after being attacked by a rabid bobcat in his own garage

Mundell, his nephew and his wife, are being treated for rabies. His wife wasn't bitten, but got the animal's blood on her hands.

State Environmental Police took the bobcat to have it tested for rabies, which they think is likely given its unusual behavior. Test results are not yet available.

'It was on me in a split second,' Mundell told the Boston Globe on Sunday. 'I have bite marks in my eyelid, up my forehead. It scratched my back. I was bleeding like crazy.'

While bobcats are a common sight in Massachusetts, the timid animals usually avoid humans and it is highly unusual that they attack people.

Shock and awe: The victim claims that he only heard a hiss before being attacked in his garage

Tom French, of the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, said: 'This is completely out of character for a bobcat, even to be in the garage in the first place. It is completely consistent with an animal that may have rabies.'

Mundell told the Boston Globe that he was glad that it was him rather than his wife or teenage nephew that was attacked. 'It would have killed my wife. I know it would have,' he said.

After being taken by surprise by the bobcat, Mundell managed to throw his jacket - with the animal attached - over his head and make a run for the garage door.

But as Mundell emerged into the drive to warn his nephew, the animal reappeared and bit the teenager.

Mundell's wife had run into the house for a gun. As the couple held the cat down, Mundell shot the animal twice. 'I used everything I had to do it,' he said. 'You donâ€™t test it, you do it.'

Bobcat numbers are growing nationwide and especially in Massachusetts. But exact figures are difficult to calculate due to the animal's elusive nature.

The animal is approximately twice the size of a domestic house cat and can be easily identified by its short, 'bobbed' tail, prominent face ruff, and slightly tufted ears.
