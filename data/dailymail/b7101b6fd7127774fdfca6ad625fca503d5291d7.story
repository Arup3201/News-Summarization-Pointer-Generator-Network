A bouncing baby girl has made history by the 18th member of her family to be christened in a 140-year-old Victorian gown.

The pretty hand-stitched frock worn by eight-month-old Ffion Olivia Evans was first used when her great, great, great grandfather Nicholas Henry Oates’ was baptised in 1874.

Since then the treasured family heirloom has been passed down from generation to generation - and worn by at least 17 relations.

Heirloom: The gown has been worn by at least 17 relations including Ffion's mother Tracey Carter, 35

The bespoke cotton gown has also been lent out over the years to other relatives and friends who couldn’t afford their own and is still in remarkably good condition.

Last month it was Ffion’s turn to don the garment as it became the centrepiece of yet another family christening in Pendeen, Cornwall.

The tiny baby followed in the footsteps of her mother, Tracy Carter, 35, who wore the gown when she was baptised at the local church in 1978.

Among those looking on was Ffion’s grandmother Jane Carter, 59, and great grandmother Joan Semmens, 81, who were also christened in the heirloom.

Tracy said: 'We’ve had so many family members wear the gown it’s become very special. Both myself and my brother wore it, as well as quite a few cousins.

'We had four generations of my family at the christening including my mum and grandmother who both wore the same dress at the same church.

'I wouldn’t have had Ffion dressed in anything else - it holds such sentimental value and I hope that she will be able to continue the family tradition by one day passing it on to her kids.'

Tracy said her mother Jane hand-washed the cotton gown before the christening after finding it stored away in a family member’s attic.

The proud mother now lives in Abergavenny, Wales with husband Oliver Evans, 31, but most of her family and friends still live in Pendeen.

And the gown hasn't just been worn by family members: over the years, it has also been lent to friends and other members of the close-knit local community, among them, their former pub landlord.

Tracy, an employment trainer, said: 'My mum washed the gown before the christening as she found it looking slightly yellow.

'On the day it looked so pristine - I could tell my mum became quite emotional while we were putting Ffion in the gown.

'All the family members who are aware of the tradition were commenting on how lovely she looked - it was an amazing atmosphere.

'Pendeen church is at the centre of this tradition as many members of the family have also married there.'

The Church traditionally insisted that babies were christened in white as a symbol of purity and innocence.

Christening gowns gained popularity during the Victorian era when families were often large and it was useful to pass them down from one sibling to the next.

The garments have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years thanks to period TV dramas such as Downton Abbey and The Paradise.

The Royal family used the same christening gown, first commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1841, for 167 years.Prince George was christened in an exact replica after the vintage garment was retired in 2004 because it was too delicate to be used again.
