Lukas Podolski has once again tried to convince international team-mate Sami Khedira to join him at Arsenal by insisting he would have 'fun' in North London.

The Real Madrid midfielder seemed set to join the club this summer, but a potential move stalled after a failure to agree on his wage package.

But Podolski is still working to bring his fellow German to the club, by trying to convince him of the fun that he, Mesut Ozil and Per Mertesacker could have together.

'I didn't have to [try to convince Khedira to join Arsenal],' he told Sport Bild.

'Sami knows how much fun he could have with me, Mesut [Ozil] and Per [Mertesacker] at Arsenal.

'We had a great time together at the World Cup and I would like it very much if he comes to London.'

It is not the first time that Podolski has tried to publicly persuade Khedira to join him at the Gunners.

During Germany's trophy parade following their World Cup victory, the forward shouted 'Arsenal' whilst the midfielder was being interviewed in front of thousands of German supporters.

Khedira won the Champions League with Real Madrid last season, but will face increased competition for places this season following the arrivals of Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez.
