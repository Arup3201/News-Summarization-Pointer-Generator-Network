Word went out that Mary Portas's involvement in the regeneration of Margate would form the basis of her new TV series

When Mary Portas, self-styled Queen of Shops, announced that the rundown seaside town of Margate had been chosen to benefit from her retailing wisdom, many shopkeepers hoped the ailing resort’s fortunes might be transformed.

Word went out that the TV presenter and retail guru also wanted to use her involvement as the basis for her new series.

The intention was to show how Portas magic can turn an economically rundown town into a busy trading centre again.

But as the initial sparkle of their involvement with a celebrity champion begins to fade, the good folk of Margate are increasingly worried that the initiative is more of a vehicle for Portas’s ego — and for her bank balance — than for the rehabilitation of their once proud resort.

It is a dispute that is threatening to split the Kent town.

First, many accuse Portas of a sort of blackmail.

For, in a provocative outburst, she seemed to suggest that unless they signed up to a long list of conditions (such as making available their financial accounts and agreeing to themselves and their customers being filmed), the £100,000 worth of taxpayers’ money that she was bringing via the project might be taken away.

They also fear that like every other reality-style show, film footage might be used to ridicule them on national TV.

Indeed, some are asking whether David Cameron’s ‘High Street tsar’ should really be allowed to promote her own TV career on the back of a Government-funded scheme.

Margate was chosen after Portas announced a nationwide competition in which 12 economically-disadvantaged towns would eventually each be awarded £100,000 of taxpayers’ money to help breathe life into them.

More than 300 towns signed up to be chosen as one of the dozen ‘Portas Pilots’.

To understand how Margate is divided over the issue, it is necessary to explain how it has become two very different towns.

On the High Street that rises up above the sandy beaches — once the choice holiday destination for millions of Londoners — the traditional big-name chains have left.

Nearly 40 per cent of stores now lie empty as customers have been lured to the out-of-town Westward Cross shopping mall and the nearby Sainsbury’s and Tesco, all of which have free parking.

Meanwhile, the small, independents left on the High Street struggle to survive amid empty premises with boarded-up windows and To Let signs.

But while the High Street, with its charity shops and £1 bargain stores, epitomise recession-hit Britain, just down the hill Margate Old Town is fashionable and chic, with boutique clothes shops, a thriving café culture, bistros and art galleries.

Last year, Portas, 52, having been 
asked by Prime Minister David Cameron to lead an independent review into
 the future of the High Street, reported that an average 20 high street 
shops a day were closing across the country.

It was a stark assessment that illustrated how out-of-town shopping centres and online retailers were dramatically changing the face of British towns.

Excited by the prospect of winning £100,000 of government money to reinvigorate their town, the people of Margate drew up imaginative proposals. In May, after months of hard work, Margate was named as one of the 12 winning towns.

Mary Portas visited and joined a packed public meeting in the former Woolworths building. She told the audience that she would base her next Channel 4 series, Mary Portas: Queen Of The High Street, on their story.

But though she added, ‘This is not about me — this is about Margate’, the idea worried many locals. And their fears only increased when she said: ‘The downside for some of you is that I’ve got cameras doing this with me. They show warts and all. This ain’t going to be smooth.’

Then, in a phrase that many shop-keepers considered to be blackmail, Portas added: ‘So we either let the cameras in with me, or I go back on the train and some other town gets it (the money).’

Portas later admitted her brusque manner was a mistake, and when she made the inflammatory comment it was ‘heat of the moment stuff with a camera stuck in my face’.

In fact, the money was awarded by the Government and was not conditional on any TV deal.

However, worse was to come, and within days two producers from Optomen — a TV production company — were trying to get townsfolk to sign contracts so they could appear in Portas’s new TV series.

They were told they had to declare any psychological or physical problems that could affect filming, that they must make available all their firm’s financial records, and that they would be legally banned from discussing the programme publicly.

Shop staff and customers would also have to make themselves freely available to be filmed.

There was also anger about how much Mary Portas would make from the series, compared with the shopkeepers’ derisory appearance fee of £1 each.

The Queen of Shops has a two-year £500,000 contract with Channel 4, and will be paid a fee of about £45,000 for the three Margate programmes.

While some boutique stores in the Old Town are displaying posters declaring their love for Mrs Portas — though they won’t benefit from the £100,000, they hope they might benefit from the publicity — a very different poster was displayed on the High Street, showing the grinning face of Portas with the words: ‘Thanks people of Margate, because I’m earning £46,000.’

In the family-run Joke Shop opposite, Lesley Howard, 70, is as straight-talking as Portas: ‘A media luvvie from the TV company came in with a contract. I thought it was outrageous and very intrusive.

We refuse to appear because we would inevitably have ended up being ridiculed. Not for us, thank you!’

Nick Adams, 55, of Priceless Discounts, is still angry about Portas’s ‘insensitive’ comments that she’d leave Margate unless TV cameras were allowed.

‘That was terrible,’ he says.

He says it doesn’t need a TV celebrity to divine Margate’s problems: rising business rates, high street parking charges and the lure of shops such as M&S and River Island at the Westward Cross mall.

‘I’ve been here 22 years and I’m close to shutting up shop,’ he says. ‘I don’t see what £100,000 will do to help. Also, I’m worried that a reality TV show will simply ridicule us.’

Another shopkeeper tore up his contract with the TV firm when he was told he had to provide detailed information about his private life.

Some shopkeepers have also expressed irritation that many new shops have signed up to the TV series even though they are not part of the £100,000 regeneration scheme.

The spit-and-sawdust-style Bull’s Head pub in the Old Town refuses to embrace the trendy ways characterising most of the neighbourhood.

Landlady Alison Burke doesn’t mince her words. ‘This whole thing is about helping Mary Portas’s TV career,’ she says, pulling a pint for a man covered in tattoos.

John Houston has personal experience of the Portas treatment after she visited his successful Outside The Square Gallery.

‘She just walked in unannounced,’ he says. ‘Suddenly this red-haired woman arrived with her entourage of about 30 people and a TV crew. I didn’t know who she was.

‘I didn’t want so many people cramming into my gallery, so I said: “Excuse me, could you leave?”

They said they only wanted to ask me some questions. I said: “Leave!”’

Deborah Ellis, 39, who owns Madam Popoff Vintage clothing, has signed up to appear in the series but admits the producers warned her that Mrs Portas can sometimes come across as a bit abrupt.

‘They said if she was too harsh with her constructive criticism of the shop, I should tell the production crew,’ she says. ‘It will hurt, but it could be invaluable.’

A Channel 4 spokesman said Optomen had enjoyed ‘positive feedback’ from shopkeepers, adding that contracts are being amended after people raised concerns.

‘Whether Margate decides that it wants to take part in the TV series won’t in any way affect the work Mary is doing with the Government and 12 Portas Pilot towns,’ it said.

‘Mary is passionate about her work to help reinvigorate the High Street, and the programme will be made in that spirit.’

Back on Margate High Street, Julian Poupard, 75-year-old owner of Henrys, an electrical and camera shop, says: ‘It’s very sad, the decline of the High Street. It means the decline of a community.

‘Mary Portas says she wants to introduce market stallholders — but how will that have any effect on things such as soaring rates or parking costs?

‘I may be cynical, but I fear this government initiative is all helping her TV show and her career. There’s no proof to show that it will help towns such as Margate.’
