Two toddlers have been injured - one critically - after a bouncy house they were in was lifted by a gust of wind and blown 60 feet before crashing to the ground.

The two boys, aged two and three, had climbed into the inflatable structure at Sullivan Farm in Nashua, New Hampshire on Sunday. The farm's owner has since said it was not open at the time. 

The house went airborne, flew over a fence and then crashed to the ground, leaving the two-year-old child with critical injuries and the older boy with less serious injuries.

'We see the bouncy house come up off the ground and slam right back down to the place that it was and then it takes off about 60 to 70 feet in the air,' one of the victims' fathers told WMUR.

Danger: Two boys climbed inside this bouncy house at a New Hampshire farm on Sunday even though the structure was closed. It was then swept away by a gust of wind and they were thrown to the ground

Landing: The bouncy house can be seen between trees, where it landed after flying 60 feet in the air

'It travels maybe about 100-150 feet away and slams both of our children down into the ground.'

Fire officials said they believe the structure actually traveled between 50 and 60 feet but do not know how high it went.

Photographs taken after the incident show the deflated house where it came to a stop between trees along a muddy path at the farm.

When the bouncy house landed, the two boys were trapped inside, but their parents managed to pull them out. 

The younger boy was flown to a Boston hospital for treatment, while the three-year-old was taken to a local hospital, where he is expected to recover. Staff said the older boy was up and talking.

The farm's co-owner, Gary Bergeron, told WMUR that the bouncy house had been inflated so it could dry off after last week's rain and was not open at the time.

Confusion: Farm co-owner Gary Bergeron told WMUR that the bouncy house was drying out and had been blocked by hay bales and was not supposed to be used. The families thought it was open

Investigation: Staff at Sullivan Farm, pictured, said the bouncy house was closed and no one gave them permission to enter it, but one of the boys' fathers said a staff member indicated that it was open

He said that after moving it, the bouncy house was blocked off with a couple of hay bales. Rides require tickets but there were no tickets being sold for the inflatable, he added.

A spokesperson for the farm said that they were not given permission to enter it. 

But the father of one of the injured boys says a farm volunteer led visitors to believe it was open.

Another farm visitor, Ron Perry, said: 'There was no sign saying it was closed.... There was no indication that it was closed. I asked how much was it and he said it was free.

Bergerson added: 'This is so unfortunate. 'It wasn't meant to be used. I just hope the kids are OK.'

The incident is being investigated by Nashua Police and Fire and the State Fire Marshal's Office.
