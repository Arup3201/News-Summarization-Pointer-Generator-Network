Two brothers have turned their father into an internet sensation by filming videos of him losing his temper and launching into expletive-laden tirades.

Mitchell and Dylan Orval, from Melbourne, film videos of their father Mark Orval blowing up over everything from too much chili in his dinner to having his car seat warmers going on a hot day.

The 'Angry Dad' clips have had more than one million views between them on Facebook and YouTube, and have attracted plenty of fans online.

The internet fame is also extending to Mr Orval's real life, with the media executive and former Collingwood player getting stopped in the street and asked for photos.

In one video titled '#AngryDad busted at KFC' Mitchell, 18, follows his father, who has a hangover, to the fast food outlet after he lied and said he was getting sushi.

'I know Angry Dad far too well to know he's not getting sushi so I'm just camped outside KFC,' he says in the video.

After catching him coming out of the KFC outlet, Mitchell yells out 'Hey D, how's the chicken?'

'Angry Dad' responds by yelling: 'F*** off Mitchell you're a f***ing stalker, seriously.'

In another video, Mitchell and Dylan prank their dad by adding too much chili to his dinner.

'That's f***ing hot honey. That's f***ing hot!' he yells.

Dylan (right) said he and his brother Mitchell (left) have always enjoyed provoking their father and filming his reactions but only recently starting posting them online

Mitchell and Dylan can be heard laughing in the background as he gets angrier.

'What have you f***ing done to it? Don't be stupid!' he shouts.

'Mitchell turn it off now, you've f***ed a good meal,' he then says, in reference to the camera.

Dylan Orval, 21, said he and his brother Mitchell have always enjoyed provoking their father and filming his reactions but only recently starting posting them online.

'We love stirring dad up,' Dylan told Daily Mail Australia.

'He's got a really short temper and he's very, very easy to stir up.

'It's getting harder now when he sees the camera he knows it's going to end up on social media.' 

But Dylan said his father was taking his new-found fame well.

'Now because he's public he's starting to get noticed,' he said.

After catching him coming out of the KFC outlet, Mitchell yells out 'Hey D, how's the chicken?'

'Everyone's taking the piss out of him, but he's sort of just copping it sweet.

'He just thinks it's sick, he can't believe so many people can like it so much and they want photos with him.'

Questions were raised over whether the videos were staged, given that Mark Orval is the founder of Newzbid, a company that sells 'user generated content' to media organisations.

But Dylan insisted the blow ups were authentic.

'You'd only have to ring anywhere from one to three to five to 10 of my mates – they've witnessed it 100 times,' he said.

'I think if it was set up people would work it out pretty quickly.

'It's certainly not set up.'

Dylan said his brother had an Angry Dad T-shirt made and now they are getting requests from people wanting to buy one after he posted a picture of it to their Angry Dad Facebook page

Dylan added that they planned to keep uploading videos, and would only stop if it started affecting Mr Orval's personal life.

'If it ever got to the stage that it was going to tarnish his reputation or his job [we'd stop],' he said.

'It's not too bad at the moment.

'I mean I think you'd find that most dads at some stage are like that, our dad is more than often.'

Dylan said his brother had an Angry Dad T-shirt made and now they are getting requests from people wanting to buy one after he posted a picture of it to their Angry Dad Facebook page.

'Our Pop's suffering from Alzheimer's so we want to start selling the T-shirts and donating money to a charity for Alzheimer's,' he said.

'Me and my brother are very close to him, he lives in the country in Horsham and we don't get to see him much.'
