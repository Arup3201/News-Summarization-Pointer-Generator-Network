Britain’s most senior criminal judge was left red-faced today when two convicted killers failed to turn up to court for sentencing hours after he granted them bail.

Judge Brian Barker QC, The Recorder of London, allowed Lithuanians Valodia Tarasov, 35, and his younger brother Jurius Tarasov, 33, to remain free overnight.

The pair were convicted of manslaughter at the Old Bailey yesterday along with their older sibling Viktoras, 39, over the death of Pawel Pacholak.

Britain's most senior criminal judge, Brian Baker QC, bailed three brothers convicted over a man's death the night before they were to be sentenced and only one of them appeared in court the next day

Jurius Tarasov, 33, left, and his older brother Valodia, 35, failed to show up for sentencing after being bailed

But only Viktoras turned up be sentenced - forcing Judge Barker to issue a warrant for their arrest.

Detectives believe the brothers are trying to return to eastern Europe.

After issuing warrants for their arrests, the judge told the court: ‘I expect they will be caught reasonably quickly.'

Viktoras was remanded in custody to be sentenced at a later date.

Pawel Pacholak, 37, was attacked by the brothers, and later died, following a drinking session where he was accused of stealing one of their mobile phones

Police have issued an urgent request for information on the brothers and say anyone who sees them should dial 999.

The Tarasovs killed Mr Pacholak, a 37 
year-old Polish man, after wrongly accusing him of stealing a mobile 
phone during a drinking session. Jurius Tarasov had in fact left the 
handset at a betting shop.

Viktoras Tarasov, 39, the oldest of the three siblings, was the only one to turn up to court and has been remanded in custody to be sentenced at a later date

The brothers repeatedly attacked Mr Pacholak both outside and inside their flat in Streatham, south London, on 12 January last year.

Mr Pacholak was so desperate to escape his attackers he locked himself in the bathroom before jumping or falling from the first floor window.

Despite suffering a broken neck, Mr Pacholak managed to stagger a short distance before collapsing against a wall in Albert Carr Gardens.

He was found dead by a passer-by several hours later at around 11.50am.

A postmortem found Mr Pacholak had suffered multiple injuries to his head and face as well as 11 broken ribs.

Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee told the court: ‘The nature of this attack was sufficient to make Pawel Pacholak flee up the stairs, first to take refuge in the toilet and then in the adjacent bathroom where he locked himself in.

‘From that room such was his obvious and understandable fear that he either jumped or fell to his death in order to escape his pursuers.’

Jurius, of Stockwell, claimed he only pushed Mr Pacholak once while his brothers, both from Croyden, denied knowledge of any attack. They all denied the charge of manslaughter.

The brothers were also convicted of perverting the course of justice.
