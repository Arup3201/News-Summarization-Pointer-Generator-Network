When going on a holiday many of us fear the inconvenience of having to claim lost items, missing luggage or even delayed flights - but what about having your finger bitten off by a rhino?

Seasonal travellers often forget that unusual circumstances can happen while on an overseas holiday, with a number of extraordinary insurance claims making their way to Australian insurance companies in recent times.

Laura Campbell from Allianz Global Assistance told Daily Mail Australia that most people would be surprised at how many unusual claims come through.

'Australians are becoming very adventurous when they travel, trying to seek a unique experience - sometimes in the hunt of that they can come across circumstances that they weren't expecting,' Ms Campbell said.

'You tend to find yourself in these unusual situations when you expand your horizons and become more adventurous.

'Who would ever think they would get their finger bitten off by a rhino at a zoo or be involved in a motorcycle accident while on a holiday with your secret boyfriend, who your husband wasn't aware of? - Now that is pretty weird,' she said.

Other unusual claims have seen an Australian man attending a Burning Man festival in the United States who accidentally set his beard alight while trying to help a fire-breather, another man mistaking his foot for marine life while spear-fishing and also a young male falling from his hotel balcony after attempting to throw a cheese burger to his friend, Allianz Travel Assistance reports.

Ms Campbell said that claims are reviewed by analyst specialists who are trained at investigating the level of care that would have been taken during the incident.

They determine whether the person was at fault or if it was out of their hands.

'The cheeseburger claim came from an Australian guy holidaying in New Zealand - you don't think that those things happen on holiday but we found out that the balcony was actually never fixed correctly so it was a legitimate claim.

'He was running at full force and threw a cheeseburger to a friend on an adjacent balcony - he flipped and fell. 

'The balcony didn't provide enough assistance and the accident impeded on his holiday experience,' Ms Campbell said.

She said that unusual claims tend to be made more frequently during the June/July winter period when people go skiing or during Christmas time when Australians opt to take longer holidays.

'As the busier travel periods come around we tend to see more of these unusual claims come up.'

Aside from those unusual and unlucky medical claims, Ms Campbell said the whole lost luggage saga is still a very common claim made by Australian travellers.

Losing your luggage is one thing, but losing your luggage as a bride is a whole other story.

'We have had a claim from an Australian bride getting married in Bali - she arrived at the hotel and left her wedding dress and shoe bag in the foyer.

'It had her garter,her wedding ring, her husband’s wedding ring, her dress and shoes in the bag - the hotel concierge slung that bag over another bag that was taken by another guest - it was never returned.

'That was extremely stressful for the bride, she had to go out locally to buy another dress and we paid her out.'

Ms Campbell said that no two cases are ever the same but assisting travellers and making sure they are safe is always a number one priority.

'In the first phone call we have to make sure they are in a safe situation and can be moved safely - people call us very quickly you'd be surprised.

'We advise them to immediately seek medical care and make sure they go to a facility for an assessment.'

She said Australians are very fortunate to have the highest level of medical care available.

Travellers often opt for the cheapest insurance policy and forget that extraordinary things do happen while on the other side of the world.

'In the excitement of booking holidays people may not spend an appropriate amount of time assessing what their insurance covers them for.

'People need to think, "well if I want to have that open ended experience and pick up those different tours and opportunities then I should make sure I am legally able to claim fully in case something happens"", Ms Campbell said.
