This is the cheetah who cheated death after he was abandoned at birth by his mother.

The scrappy puss, who has not yet been named, was born at the Wildlife Safari in Oregon on May 8 - the 174th birth at the park since 1972, when their cheetah breeding program began.

But as soon as he arrived, his mother, Moya, appeared to want nothing to do with him, even refusing to clean off the birth sack meaning he would only survive for a few minutes if keepers didn't instantly step in.

Doing well: The unnamed cub was the 174th birth at Wildlife Safari in Oregon since 1972, when their cheetah breeding program began

Weak: But as soon as the youngster arrived, his mother appeared to want nothing to do with him, even refusing to clean off the birth sack, meaning he would only survive a few minutes if keepers didn't instantly step in

Even after safely removing the sack, worried staff realised he wasn't breathing and were forced to act, simulating his breathing artificially.

Luckily, he responded and he was placed in an incubator at Wildlife Safari's animal hospital.

The cub, who has not yet been named, will be transferred to another Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) once he is fit enough.

Sarah Roy, the Carnivore Supervisor at the zoo, said: 'Given this rare opportunity to hand raise the cub he will soon become an ambassador for his species at another AZA accredited facility.'

The Cheetah Ambassador Program is designed to educate children in AZA zoos and schools through activities, visits from the cats and 'meet and greets' at the zoos.

Cheetahs are the fastest land mammal and are built for speed.

Survivor: Luckily, he responded and he was placed in an incubator at Wildlife Safari's animal hospital

Majestic: There are less than 10,000 cheetahs left in Africa, with Namibia having the largest population of around 3,000

They can reach speeds of 70 miles per hour for short sprints and have a deep chest for large lungs and a powerful heart.

There are less than 10,000 left in Africa, with Namibia having the largest population of around 3,000.

The big cats are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching and hunting by farmers worried about their livestock.

According to Wildlife Safari, Cheetahs live for six to eight years in the wild and 10 to 15 years in captivity.

Mother Moya gave birth to her cub at Wildlife Safari, Oregon, on May 8

But when baby emerged, not breathing, she was completely uninterested

So keepers had to step in and begin stimulating his breathing artificially

But the cub, who's not been named, responded and is said to be doing well
