Nathan Gardiner was on a caravaning holiday in Northumberland when he was hit by a van

A teenager who suffered severe head injuries in a horror crash has stunned medics by coming back from the dead. 

Nathan Gardiner was on a caravaning holiday in Northumberland when he was hit by a van. 

The 13-year-old was placed into an induced coma for two weeks, where his body was kept alive with a network of tubes and ventilators.

His head injuries were so severe, his family were told there was little chance he would survive and were told by doctors to say their final goodbyes as he lay unconscious in Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary's critical unit.

But Nathan defied medics to make a miracle recovery and, after three months in hospital and a further six months of rehabilitation, he is on the road to recovery.

Nathan, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, was knocked down on August 24 last year as he crossed Lintonville Terrace in Ashington, Northumberland.

He was taken to Wansbeck Hospital in Ashington before being transferred to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary.

A huge section of his skull was cut away by surgeons leaving a patchwork of stitches as they tried to ease the pressure on his brain.

Nathan's mum Anita, 37, who works in the adult social services department at Gateshead Council, said: 'They said they had done all the surgery and they didn't know if he was going to pull through.

'That's not something you expect to hear. 

'It was devastating. You don't want professionals to tell you that they can't save your boy - your world just scrambles. 

'We had to bring his brother James in because they told us to say goodbye.

'They said they didn't think he was going to make it through the weekend.'

Nathan had been in Northumberland with his grandmother Margaret Gardiner, his uncle, Neil Gardiner, and his brother James, eight, on a caravaning holiday.  

Despite his condition, Nathan staged a remarkable fight for life and was slowly weaned off medication and brought out of his coma.

The teenager was so ill when he left hospital that his family placed a hospital bed in their living room so he could continue treatment.

In February, Nathan returned to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary where he underwent a four-hour operation to fit him with a titanium skull.

His movement on the left-hand side of his body is still affected and he has started a phased return to school.

Anita said: 'He's feisty like me. One of my colleagues from work, Jamie Scorer, did the Great North Run and he put Nathan's name on his shirt.

'When he finished he gave Nathan his medal. 

'We've had incredible support from everyone, from work, from people on the estate, from people we know from the caravan. They've been wonderful.'

Police launched an investigation into the accident but they took no further action against the driver.

Now Nathan's family have enlisted the help of a legal team from Irwin Mitchell in a bid to access vital funds which will ensure their son can get the best rehabilitation he needs. 

Anita said: 'I'm thankful every single day that he's still here. But there's still a part of you that grieves for what he was like.

'We just want questions answered and a bit of charity so we can move on.

'I'm not looking to blame the lad who was driving. I know he didn't set out to hurt Nathan, it's just so we have a bit of peace of mind.

'We've had that many stories and inconsistencies we don't really know what happened.'

Anita is hoping to trace witnesses who can help piece together how the accident occurred.

Fran Mayes, a partner at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'It's been a traumatic eight months for Nathan and his family but any information people might have about how the accident happened could prove vital in our efforts to secure the support Nathan will need.'
