Under fire Labour leader Ed Miliband was publicly backed today - by veteran left winger Ken Livingstone.

Mr Miliband has come under pressure after polls showed the Tories had moved ahead of Labour in the wake of David Cameron's row in Brussels.

But Mr Livingstone said he had 'no doubt' that the Labour leader would become Prime Minister next year.

Ed Miliband unveiled Labour's new economic policies in Leeds today - promising to give more power and money to English cities outside London

Ken Livingstone was twice beaten by Boris Johnson in his bid to become London mayor. The veteran left winger has urged Mr Miliband to ignore Blairites within the Labour party calling on him to be less radical

Ed Miliband was today accused of 'misleading' the public after claiming four out of five private sector jobs created under the Coalition had been in London.

The Labour leader said he would hand more money and power to regional cities like Leeds and Manchester to boost the economy outside the South East.

But the Tories said the figure was out of date and that over the last 12 months four-fifths of new jobs have been created outside London, according to the the Office for National Statistics.

Business Minister Matt Hancock has written to Sir Andrew Dilnot at the UK Statistics Authority seeking clarification, and has called the data used by Labour 'several years out of date, and therefore misleading'.

He also said he could not turn down a peerage to become a minister under Mr Miliband - despite hitting 70 next year having twice been beaten by Boris Johnson in the fight to be London mayor.

Mr Livingstone's endorsement, in an interview with Total Politics magazine, will do nothing to counter claims that the Labour leader has taken the party to the left since taking over from Gordon Brown.

It comes after firebrand union leader Len McCluskey said he stood 'fully behind' Mr Miliband at the next election.

Mr Livingstone said the next Labour government would be as radical as Margaret Thatcher's in the 1980s.

He said: 'Ed will change Britain. In my lifetime, only two governments have changed things: Attlee’s and Thatcher’s.

'Ed’s will be the third. By the end of Ed’s administration, the Tories will have to adjust in the way that Blair adjusted to Thatcher.

'He will set that new agenda – I have no doubt about it. I’m always saying to Ed - ignore all those old Blairites who are still hanging around saying tone it down tone, it down.'

The former London mayor also dismissed concerns that Mr Miliband was too 'weird' to be elected Prime Minister.

He said: 'Ed is much more normal than I am. He’s actually interested in detail and facts.

'Ed does not give a damn about what he’s wearing, his hairstyle - I’m sure he’s surrounded by people telling him he needs to do this and that but he really doesn’t care any more than I did, and therefore he will change Britain. Ed is like me, he doesn’t want to be there, he wants to do something.

'He will hate all the trivial crap. People have always thought I’m weird - I collected reptiles for god’s sake, I make Ed look normal.

'Everybody thought I was weird - and with my voice, and my lack of any fashion sense, you know.

'If you think back, if Winston Churchill became leader of the Tory Party today, the media would say he’s an alcoholic, he’s overweight, he smokes - he sounds weird. If you look at the people who changed Britain, it’s not because of their looks.'

The Labour leader has faced accusations that he is 'too weird' to become Prime Minster. But the former London mayor Ken Livingstone said the country did not care

Labour has fallen behind the Conservative Party in the polls, according to a survey released by Lord Ashcroft this week

A ComRes poll found that Nigel Farage is seen as the 'weirdest' political leader, ahead of Labour's Mr Miliband 

Asked about accepting a peerage to work under Mr Miliband, he said: 'That’s a question you need to put to Ed.'

He added: 'I’ve always said to him, this is the last chance in my lifetime of getting a Labour government that works, I will do anything to help you get there.

'You can’t turn down your party leader if they ask you to do something – how could you? Dennis Skinner could, but that’s about it.'
