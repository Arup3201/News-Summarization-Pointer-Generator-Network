Happily married: Father-of-two Gary Speed said his family meant 'everything' to him in a poignant last interview

Wales football manager Gary Speed described his wife and children as the thing he 'cherished the most' in a poignant interview given shortly before his death.

The 42-year-old father-of-two said his family meant 'everything' to him, and was more important than any medal he had won during his lengthy career.

In the interview with FourFourTwo magazine, Speed said: 'The item I cherish the most isn't material. I don't even know where my Leeds championship medal is. So I'd say family: we're an item and they mean everything to me.'

The father to Ed, 14, and Tommy, 13, also told reporters three attributes that summed him up were 'hard-working, honest, self-critical' and said that captaining Wales was his 'proudest moment in football', while the saddest was when he left Newcastle United.

A minute's applause will be held for the sportsman at every Premier League game this weekend.

An inquest in Warrington yesterday heard how the former Leeds United, Everton and Newcastle United midfielder was found hanged at his Cheshire home by his wife Louise just before 7am on Sunday.

Detective Inspector Peter Lawless, of 
Cheshire Police, told Cheshire coroner Nicholas Rheinberg there appeared
to be no suspicious circumstances and a post-mortem examination found 
Speed's death was caused by hanging.

The coroner asked the media to 'respect 
the privacy' of the young manager's family, who did not attend the 
hearing, before adjourning the inquest until January 30 next year.

Yesterday it emerged Mrs Speed was given first aid
advice by paramedics as they rushed to the house on Sunday morning.

Speed's agent and best man Hayden Evans has insisted that he had not been depressed and had not argued with his wife before his death.

Speed's sister Lesley Haylock described her brother as an 'inspiration', while the family said they have been 'overwhelmed' with messages of support and condolence.

Ms Haylock wrote on Twitter: 'I have lost my brother, my friend, my inspiration. I hope you are at peace now Gary. I miss you so much.'

Tributes, which have poured in from a host of public and sporting figures, continued at football matches last night with Leeds supporters chanting Speed's name during their game with Nottingham Forest.

Meanwhile, Liverpool star Craig Bellamy struggled to control his emotions at Stamford Bridge.

Earlier in the day, Welsh Assembly Members observed a minute's silence in the Senedd, Cardiff Bay, while flags continued to fly at half mast outside the Welsh Assembly buildings Ty Hywel and the Senedd.

Supporters have left scarves, football shirts and flowers across several football stadiums - including Everton's Goodison Park, Leeds United's Elland Road, Newcastle United's St James' Park and The Millennium Stadium and Cardiff City Stadium, where Wales played their home games.

The FAW has opened a book of condolences at its offices in Cardiff allowing fans to express their feelings about Speed's death.

It also revealed plans to create a 'lasting memorial' through a garden of remembrance in Speed's honour.

FAW Chief Executive Jonathan Ford, said: 'I've no understanding of why it happened, I don't know the answer and I don't think we ever will.'

Holding back tears Mr Ford said: 'We will do whatever we can to help Louise and the boys although I am not sure we can help.

'We will just do whatever we think is right at this terrible, terrible time.

'We got together as a staff this morning and went into a huddle and cried. All I can offer is a shoulder to cry on.

'It was just a year ago we were announcing him as a manager he was sat next to me and now he is no longer here.

'Gary was our number one choice for the job because of who he was and what he was like as an individual.

'He lit up every room he would go into.'

FAW President Phil Pritchard, said: 'He was always the model professional, he was the model man as well.

'We have lost a great deal. He promised things when he took the job and we were starting to see them on the pitch.'

Meanwhile, more than ten football players have been in touch with an organisation to help them come to terms with Speed's death.

Peter Kay, the chief executive of the Sporting Chance Clinic told BBC Radio 5: 'I'm hesitant to even link that tragedy with anything good. I think it's almost inappropriate that anything good can come out of such an awful occurrence. But over ten players have contacted me since that news broke.

'That means 10 people are seeking help. That is an unusual amount.'

The news came after Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), urged players to ask for help with any issues which concern them.

Mr Taylor said the PFA, in conjunction with associated partners, regularly helped their members but the greatest hurdle was often making the first step.
