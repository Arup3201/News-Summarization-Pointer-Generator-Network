Horrified motorists were forced to swerve as kittens were thrown onto a busy dual carriageway from a speeding car.

Drivers were left in shock after witnessing four kittens being thrown from the car window of a mystery vehicle onto the A13 and A132 in Pitsea, Essex.

Sadly three kittens died in the sickening incident, although one survived after being rescued by a concerned motorist.

Survivor: This beautiful kitten survived being thrown for a speeding car onto the A13 and A132 in Pitsea, Essex

Matthew Tyler, 31, said his wife and four-year-old son were left 'hysterical' after they witnessed the callous act whilst driving at around 5pm on Saturday.

He said: 'What I witnessed was absolutely disgusting.

'My wife and son were hysterical.

'I drove on to the main A13 roundabout where I had to swerve quickly to avoid a kitten.

'I then proceeded on to the A132 where kittens were being chucked from a car every 100yds or so.

'Sadly three were killed.'

This kitten was treated at Pitsea PDSA and has made a full recovery after being thrown out of a car in Essex

Quick-thinking Mr Tyler, from Bowers Gifford, Essex, returned to the roundabout to retrieve one injured kitten before rushing it to animal charity, PDSA, whose vets administered pain relief.

The kitten is now said to be recovering well at the charity's Basildon hospital.

Unfortunately - due to the shocking nature of the incident - Mr Tyler was unable to get the number plate of the vehicle and is now appealing to other witnesses to come forward

He added: 'Because I was busy swerving around kittens and my wife was hysterical, we didn't manage to get the details of the car the kittens were being thrown from.

'It was a couple of cars in front of us.

'But I am pleading with anyone who saw this sick act, or knows anything, to contact the police.

'The people who did this need to be found.'

In another shocking incident just hours earlier, ten kittens and their mother were found in a taped-up cardboard box.

The box had been abandoned at the side of the A127 in Crays Hill, Essex - around five miles from where kittens were seen being thrown from a car later that day.

It is not yet known if the two incidents are linked.

The abandoned kittens are now available for adoption through Cats Protection on 07986 330239.

Anyone who witnessed the kittens being launched from a car at around 5pm on Saturday should call Essex Police on 101.

Animal charity PDSA is now caring for the surviving kitten and hope to re-home him after the miracle escape.

Maciej Niedbala, a vet at the Basildon PDSA pet hospital, said: "The kitten was rushed in as an emergency case after being brought in by a member of the public who had witnessed this horrific incident.

"A full examination was carried out to determine the extent of any injuries and pain relief was administered. Miraculously, despite being in shock and deeply traumatised by his ordeal, the kitten did not sustain any serious injuries.

"There is absolutely no justification for anyone to treat an animal in this way and PDSA would urge anyone who witnessed anything to contact police as a matter of urgency."

The kitten was kept overnight so that PDSA staff could monitor his condition and he has since gone on to make a full recovery.

Arrangements are now being discussed to find a new permanent home for the kitten who has been named Kenny by staff.

Police are hunting for the people responsible for the cruel act.

Anyone with information should contact Essex Police on 101.
