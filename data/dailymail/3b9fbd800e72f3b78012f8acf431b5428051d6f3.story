A 13-year-old Dutch girl who was killed in an accident has had her dream of becoming famous realised by her father, after he uploaded a video of her playing the Downton Abbey theme tune on the piano.

Anna van Keulen was hit by a car as she rode her bike to school at the beginning of October. She died from the injuries she sustained.

Her dream was to become a renowned pianist, so her loving father – Niek van Keulen – posted a video of her playing Downton Abbey song Did I Make The Most Of Loving You to YouTube.
