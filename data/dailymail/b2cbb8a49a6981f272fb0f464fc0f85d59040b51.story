From ancient mead-halls to modern pubs and clubs, it seems mankind has always enjoyed drinking - but the way we talk about alcohol has changed a lot over the centuries.

Whereas once the words 'drunken' and 'inebriated' sufficed to describe over-indulging, now we resort to elaborate euphemisms such as 'squiffy', 'blotto' and 'wasted'.

And in addition to modern slang for drinking, there are a host of now obsolete words once used to describe a heavy binge - the likes of 'bumpsy', 'suckey' and 'hit under the wing'.

Historic: This 15th-century manuscript shows how excessive drinking has always been popular

Horrors: Gin Lane, by William Hogarth, depicts 18th-century drunkenness; a new book traces the way people have talked about alcohol over the centuries

The history of the ways the English language describes alcohol has been traced by eminent linguistics professor David Crystal using the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary.

In a new book, the academic reveals that the vocabulary of drinking is richer than almost any other topic - and unites English-speakers across barriers of class, age and gender.

During the Anglo-Saxon period, the words 'drunken' and 'fordrunken' were the most common ways of describing alcoholic excess, Professor Crystal writes in the book Words in Time and Place.

However, in time there developed 'a universal trend to avoid stating the obvious', according to the author, and English-speakers began to resort to euphemisms when they discussed drinking.

Fordrunken (Old English): First used in Alfred the Great's translations of Latin works, it continued in use throughout the Middle Ages and is found in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.

Tippled (1564): A 'tippler' was someone who sold ale in a tavern - the word is thought to be related to 'tap'. It later became attached to somone who drinks a lot.

Bumpsy (1611): Apparently inspired by the way drunkards are more likely to bump into things because they cannot walk straight. The word 'bum' was also a children's word for a drink in the 16th century.

Blootered (1805): A 'blooter' is a clumsy oaf in medieval Scottish slang, leading to the adjective meaning drunk which is still in use in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Up the pole (1897): A nautical term - the pole was the mast, so someone 'up the pole' would be in a dangerous situation. It first appeared in the dictionary after a judge asked what it meant during a court case.

Poggled (1923): Military slang which has its origins in the Hindi word 'pagal', meaning a madman or an idiot. It was used particularly when a drunk person was behaving wildly.

Tired and emotional (1981): A modern euphemism usually used in a comic setting. The OED first cites it in an episode of political sitcom Yes Minister.

The earliest slang terms included the 14th-century 'cup-shotten', meaning overcome with liquor, 'inebriate', dating back to 1497, and 'bousy' - a forerunner of the modern 'booze', borrowed from Dutch and first recorded in 1529.

Some words still in common usage have a long pedigree - for example 'intoxicated', which originally meant poisoned, was first used in relation to drink as far back as 1576.

William Shakespeare and the King James Bible are commonly regarded as two of the greatest influences on the English language, and the situation is no different when it comes to phrases for drunkenness.

'In drink' was apparently coined by Shakespeare in the play Henry IV Part 1, where Falstaff uses it while talking to Prince Hal, and 'in their cups' makes its first appearance in the Bible's description of how alcohol affects the mood.

Professor Crystal divides the slang terms into a variety of different categories, based on the ways they characterise the process of losing control.

He writes in the book: 'One fruitful vein is to find terms that characterize drunken appearance (owl-eyed, pie-eyed, cock-eyed, lumpy, blue, lit) or behaviour, especially erratic movement (slewed, bumpsy, reeling ripe, towrow, rocky, on one’s ear, zigzag, tipped, looped) or lack of any movement at all (stiff, paralytic).'

Over the years, some drinkers appear to have viewed drunkenness as similar to being cooked - 'stewed', 'boiled', 'pickled' and 'steamed' have all arisen since the 18th century.

While the origins of many terms - such as 'rummy' and 'under the influence' - may be relatively obvious, others are rather more complex.

'Three sheets in the wind', for instance, is a naval analogy - 'sheets' are ropes attached to a sail, so when three of them are loose the sail will flap around and cause the boat to weave like a drunk person.

Contrast: Now drinking increasingly centres on bars and clubs which serve shots of spirits such as tequila

A minority of words attempt the subtle task of describing someone who is only a little drunk, such as 'squiffy', popularised by the novels of P.G. Wodehouse, and 'half-shaved', used in the US during the 19th century.

Most drinking slang appears to have developed organically, but some is promoted by the actions of governments - for example, since drink-driving was outlawed in Britain in 1966, the phrase 'over the limit' has been used to describe being drunk.

Professor Crystal also points out that many words which originally described drinking have over the past few decades mutated and become attached to drug use as well.

'High', 'loaded' and 'stoned' all began as alcohol slang, even though now they would more naturally describe someone who had taken narcotics.

Elsewhere in the book the author - one of the world's greatest experts on the English language, who is now Honorary Professor of Linguistics at the University of Wales, Bangor - also follows the development of words for topics such as dying, money, fooling around and going to the toilet.

The work is based on the Historical Thesaurus, which uses the world-famous Oxford English Dicitionary to chart how different words meaning the same thing come into use before falling out of popularity.

Words in Time and Place: Exploring Language Through the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary, by David Crystal, is out now published by Oxford University Press. 

Give up the ghost (Old English): This phrase dates back to the Anglo-Saxon period, when 'gast' (ghost) was commonly used to mean spirit or soul.

Pass (1340): To say that someone has 'passed' is considered sensitive language in North America - it first appeared in the 14th century, and was popularised by Shakespeare in King Lear.

Bite the dust (1697): This phrase was also rendered as 'bite the ground' and 'bite the sand' when it was first used by writers such as Dryden and Pope. It is based on the image of a soldier falling to the ground during battle.

Snuff out (1864): Based on the metaphor of extinguishing a candle. The phrase, transformed into 'snuff it', is now usually used in a casual context.

Meet your maker (1933): Despite the apparently archaic nature of this phrase, it was first used by American crime novelist Dorothy L. Sayers.

Privy (1225): Taken from the French 'privée', meaning private place. This was for many years the main word used to describe the toilet.

Jakes (1530s): The etymology of this word is unclear, but it may derive from the name Jaques. It is now mostly heard in regional dialects.

Water closet (1755): A euphemistic term, usually abbreviated to WC, which alludes to the small size of most toilets - comparable to a closet.

Outhouse (1819): Originally meant any building outside, but became attached to toilets during the time when they were commonly installed in separate buildings near the main home.

Loo (1940): Another obscure origin. It could be an abbreviation of 'Waterloo', or come from the French 'l'eau', as an allusion to 'water'. Commonly associated with the genteel middle class.

Hoddypeak (1500): Based on an old word for a snail's shell. The horns of a snail were associated with the 'cuckold's horns' which denoted a husband whose wife was unfaithful.

Nincompoop (1673): The suffix 'poop' was used as a verb meaning to deceive. 'Nin' could be a reference to the word 'ninny', or it could denote the name 'Nick'.

Silly billy (1834): This rhyming phrase was often adopted by clowns who 'acted the fool' alongside a straight man. It became attached as a term of abuse to prominent people called William, most famously King William IV.

Plonker (1981): Popularised by Only Fools and Horses, where main character Del Boy used it as a term of abuse for his sidekick Rodney. Earlier in the 20th century, the word was a slang term for penis.

Numpty (1988): Possibly an abbreviation of 'numbskull', with the ending adapted by analogy with the nursery rhyme Humpty Dumpty. First used in Scotland.

Money (1325): Even though this is by far the most common word today, it did not enter English until the 14th century. In the early days of banknotes, 'money' was sometimes used to refer only to coins.

Mammon (1539): A name for the Devil in the Bible. It became the personification of greed, and for several centuries was also used to mean money or riches in a more general sense.

Mopus (1699): Taken from a German word for bread, this was the name of a small coin. The phrase 'having the mopusses' is used now in the Midlands and North of England.

Dough (1851): This ancient word became a slang term for money in the US during the 19th century, and was then imported into the UK by Arthur Conan Doyle and P.G. Wodehouse.

Lolly (1943): 'Lollipop' was Cockney rhyming slang for 'drop', which referred to money given as a tip.
