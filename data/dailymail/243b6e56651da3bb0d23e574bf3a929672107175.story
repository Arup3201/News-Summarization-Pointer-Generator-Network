As if there weren't already enough potential perils on the slopes, skiers in Steamboat Springs in Colorado had to contend with a charging moose this week. 

In footage shot on Sunday, December 28, a moose wandered onto the popular ski fields of Routt County and took aim at a red jacket-wearing ski patrolman.

Luckily for the patrolman, who was not on skis, he was fleet of foot enough to evade the largest member of the deer like a matador.

Moose are commonly found in the area after being introduced in the late 1970s. 

Run-ins between the creatures and people aren't  entirely uncommon. A woman walking her dogs in February was injured when charged.

In this case, however, no-one was harmed.
