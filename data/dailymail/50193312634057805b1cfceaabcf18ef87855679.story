A mother who claims she was sacked from her job as a restaurant manager for having a baby is suing her employer for discrimination.

Marzena Castillo, from Chicago, Illinois, was working at the city's Northside Bar and Grill in Bucktown when she fell pregnant.

When she told her boss she was expecting last year, she claims he picked on her and told her he was 'disappointed' in her, making her pregnancy a 'nightmare'.

She told CBS2: 'It’s supposed to be the best time of my life, when I’m pregnant, and it wasn’t'. 

She said that after giving birth to baby Eros, she began getting 'nasty comments about breastfeeding' and was then asked to leave.

Ms Castillo claims she wasn't told why and is now suing the restaurant claiming discrimination.

However, the restaurant owner denies the allegation but would not explain why Ms Castillo had to leave her job.

Co-owner Cyril Landise said in a written statement to the news channel: 'We would never fire anyone because they were pregnant and we didn’t. We support women who have families and continue to do so.'

Her lawyer said people cannot be fired for discriminatory reasons and said she was fired for these reasons.

Ms Castillo had worked for the restaurant since 2004.

Her online CV says she was 
responsible for co-ordinating the 300-seater restaurant as well as 
recruiting, training and motivating the 50 front and back of house 
staff.

She also had to supervise all the staff rotas and performance.

Figures show three quarters of U.S. women entering the workforce will become pregnant.
