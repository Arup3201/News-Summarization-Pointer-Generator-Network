A tribute to the victims of the fatal Sydney siege will be installed in the Lindt cafe before it reopens.

Repairs are under way at the Martin Place site, which has been closed since the siege in mid-December.

A decision on when the cafe will open its doors is due to be made next week, a company source told AAP on Wednesday.

'There are some serious practical considerations to work through,' he said.

'Plainly the Martin Place murderer took advantage of our system. That's what this report is designed to expose to us and we will take the strongest possible action to ensure this can't happen again,' he said.

It was revealed at a coronial inquest last week that Mr Johnson was shot in the head by Monis after being forced to kneel on the cafe floor.

Ms Dawson was killed by fragments of ricocheting bullets fired by police as they stormed the cafe.
