A gift firm has come under fire for selling mints that look like Breaking Bad's crystal meth - dubbing them 'crystal menth'. 

Online retailer Firebox is advertising its 'Blue Sky Candy' - which comes in 130g (4.5oz) bags - for £7.99.

It claims the peppermints are '99.1 per cent pure' and compares them to methamphetamine, a highly addictive, crystal-like drug.

Inspiration: The peppermints have been inspired by the blue-coloured substance made by chemistry teacher Walter White, right, in Breaking Bad

It also admits to using cult TV series Breaking Bad - which prominently features crystal meth dealers - as inspiration for the blue-coloured product. 

On its website, Firebox boasts: 'Cooked up in the Firebox lab under strictly controlled conditions, Blue Sky Candy is authentic looking peppermint rock candy inspired by the hit series Breaking Bad.

'Coming in at 99.1% chemically pure, we’re manufacturing some serious weight, allowing us to offer these 4.5oz bags at street value.

'So break off a chunk and enjoy some quality crystal menth… just don’t tell the narcos.'

Awareness: The cult TV series has brought metheamphetamine - a highly addictive drug - to public attention

At the bottom of the website, it notes: 'This is NOT actually crystal meth'.

Unlike methamphetamine - which can include common household chemicals such as battery acid, drain cleaner and lantern fuel - 'Blue Sky Candy' is said to include sugar, glucose, peppermint oil and colour E133.

Consumers can also pre-order the product legally on Firebox's website.

'Distributed using trusted yet completely secretive methods, we bring our product directly to you, hassle free' its website states.

Multi award-winning: Walter White, left, played by Bryan Cranston, and Aaron Paul, right, played by Jesse Pinkman, both feature in the drama

Last night, a spokesman for leading drugs charity Cranstoun condemned the firm's 'trivialisation' of methamphetamine, which can lead to severe paranoia, lesions, hallucinations and even death.

She told The Sun: 'Trivialising this drug is ultimately irresponsible as it takes one further step towards normalising what can be catastrophic substance use.'

Breaking Bad, which saw its finale attract a staggering 10.3million viewers in September, has brought metheamphetamine into the public consciousness.

The multi award-winning drama follows the life of chemistry teacher Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, who, after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, starts making crystal meth to secure his family's future.

Firebox has refused to comment.

Methamphetamine - often referred to as 'crystal meth' - is a highly addictive drug that stimulates the brain and nervous system.

It is Class A drug - with those in possession of it risking up to seven years in jail and/or an unlimited fine.

Supplying the substance can result in life imprisonment.

Even in small doses, methamphetamine can increase wakefulness and physical activity, while decreasing appetite.

It can also cause a variety of cardiovascular problems, including rapid heart rate, irregular heartbeat and increased blood pressure.

An overdose can lead to hyperthermia and convulsions - and if not treated immediately, can result in death.

The short-term effects of methamphetamine may include:
