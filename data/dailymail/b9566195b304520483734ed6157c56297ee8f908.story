Financial pressure: Sir Hugh Orde has warned that financial pressure felt by certain ranks could fuel a wave of corruption

Hard-up officers are more likely to take bribes if they are underpaid, one of Britain’s most senior police chiefs has claimed.

The financial pressure felt by ‘certain ranks’ could fuel a wave of corruption, warned Sir Hugh Orde.

The president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) also appeared to compare Britain to some third world countries where illegal payments to law enforcers are engrained in society.

But his comments provoked a row last night when furious MPs said it was ‘appalling’ to suggest officers could commit a crime to make ends meet.

Politicians said chief officers must keep a ‘sense of balance’ amid current reforms to police pay and pensions and claimed rank-and-file officers would be shocked at their integrity being questioned.

Sir Hugh singled out the starting salary of £19,000 for junior PCs as too low during an interview about morale as leaders battle to slash costs.

‘There are certain ranks in the service who are vulnerable in terms of their income and expenditure, which means we should be worried,’ he said.

‘One thing around learning from corruption and integrity is that if  you underpay police officers – for example, there are some forces around the world where officers are hardly paid at all – the consequence is corruption.

‘I am not saying that is the case here at all, but it is something we should be mindful of. Some officers are under some financial pressure and they don’t dump those worries when they come to work.’ 

The Coalition has pushed through swingeing reforms to police pay and conditions – including longer hours, pay freezes, the scrapping of many bonuses and higher contributions to final salary pensions. 

But Police Minister Damian Green has said that pay packages remain ‘significantly better’ than any comparable role in the private sector.

Most Police and Crime Commissioners also offer more than £19,000 to recruits.

The comments by former Northern Ireland police chief Sir Hugh come after Acpo commissioned a report on integrity that claimed financial pressures increase the ‘vulnerability’ of some officers to corruption or ‘inappropriate secondary employment’.

Police

A recent review found record numbers of police being investigated for corruption, mostly junior officers accused of illegally disclosing information to criminals or others.

Police now face the introduction of a formal code of ethics amid calls for those guilty of misconduct to be ‘struck off’ a professional register like doctors and lawyers.

Michael Ellis, Tory MP for 
Northampton North, said pay reforms had been ‘misinterpreted’ in many 
areas and had actually led to pay rises for large numbers of staff.

He added: ‘I’m appalled at the idea that police officers of any rank will be susceptible to corruption for any reason.’

Conservative
 colleague Mark Reckless, MP for Rochester and Strood, said the vast 
majority of officers would be ‘horrified’ by Sir Hugh’s comments.

‘It
 is the culture against corruption which is much more important than 
whether a salary is being increased by one or two per cent a year,’ he 
added.

The row came as
 Acpo’s civilian chief executive was sacked last week after being 
accused of stealing from the body’s Westminster offices.

Tom Flaherty, 54, was thrown out for gross misconduct at a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday.

He
 had been suspended on full pay since he was arrested last April accused
 of stealing Sir Hugh’s desk diary amid a spate of petty thefts.

The case was a major embarrassment 
for Acpo as it faced accusations of a cover-up and the organisation, 
dubbed a ‘boys club for senior officers’ by its critics, now faces 
abolition after an independent review of its work.

Police and Crime 
Commissioners are expected to announce they will no longer fund it in 
its present form within weeks.

A
 Police Federation spokesman said there is nothing to suggest financial 
issues would affect the integrity of officers – but said leaders should 
be ‘mindful’ of the strain officers are under.
