Danny Cipriani is aiming to arrive in Auckland on Wednesday well rested and well read. The Sale fly-half’s flight plan included further exploration of the power of instinctive thought.

The book in his carry-on bag for the long-haul journey is another minor element of the 26-year-old’s career revival strategy — fine-tuned with the help of Jonny Wilkinson’s long-term mentor, Steve Black. So, as the first contingent of England’s squad hurtled across the time zones to New Zealand, Cipriani intended to peruse more words of wisdom.

‘I’m about a third of the way through a book called Blink, by Malcolm Gladwell,’ he said, after explaining a recent reading habit. ‘It’s about going with your instinctive decisions rather than taking the time to think and then  trying to adjust, because about 90 per cent of the time our instincts are  correct. You can take things out of it and apply it to rugby in terms of how you want to play, your decision-making, things like that. It keeps your mind occupied and working.’

Black
 sets Cipriani various tasks, such as keeping a daily journal and 
reading books, then discussing the contents. The intention is to occupy 
his mind and make him think — in this case, ironically, think about not 
thinking too much.

Both 
mentor and pupil will recognise the fact that the gifted No 10 has not 
always been well served by his instincts but they have been more 
reliable for the past year and more. Cipriani has spoken of how a 
drunken night out in Leeds last April served as a tipping point. The 
shock of being rushed to hospital after being hit by a bus convinced him
 finally to make the most of a talent which had been in danger of going 
to waste.

The decision to 
seek assistance from Black last summer was the first step towards a 
profound transformation. The upshot has been a season of consistent form
 at his improving club and enough evidence of enhanced commitment and 
defensive resilience that an international recall which had seemed a  
distant prospect has now come to pass.  

‘I
 knew I had to make some changes, to get my head down and do it the 
rugby way,’ said Cipriani. ‘That came probably in April last year. I 
started to work with Steve and I made the conscious decision that I 
wanted to put my head down and really go for it.

‘I’ve
 had quite an enjoyable 12-15 months since then and it was always the 
dream, always the goal to get back in the England squad. Fortunately 
enough, I have the chance to go to New Zealand and hopefully I’ll 
represent my country again.’

This
 is a player with a high profile who attracts strident preconceptions 
and polarises opinion. But there is a sense that the penny has dropped. 
Maturity has seized Cipriani and pointed him towards the virtues of 
selfless hard graft and modest professionalism. Having played his way 
back into the England squad, he is hell-bent on showing team-mates, 
coaches and the public his altered nature and determination to make best
 use of his ability.

Asked 
if he relished this chance to change perceptions, he said: ‘Definitely, 
especially off the field. I want to give the best example of myself that
 I can over the next month and show them that I want to be an England 
rugby player more than anything. That’s my goal.’

England
 in the Stuart Lancaster era have a revived streak of humility at their 
core. There are those who would question how a player often regarded as 
brash and self-centred could fit into a set-up where the emphasis is so 
emphatically on national pride and the common cause.

Yet, Cipriani rejects the notion that he must change to gain acceptance. ‘I feel like that has always been me,’ he said.

‘To
 come into this environment, I’ve got so much learning and catching up 
to do, I’ve not really got time to focus on anything else. I know I’m 
not first-choice here so humility has to come with that immediately. But
 I know where I want to be.’

Exile: Cipriani has not played for England since Martin Johnson was manager in 2008

Lifeline: Stuart Lancaster is the first England coach to pick Cipriani in almost six years

Where
 he wants to be is in the Test No 10 shirt — not just as a temporary 
stand-in, but when Lancaster has everyone available, unlike in Auckland 
next weekend when Owen Farrell, Stephen Myler and George Ford will all 
be out of contention. Even without those more established rivals to 
usurp, Cipriani is destined to play second fiddle to Freddie Burns.

He
 will have to fight tooth and nail for a chance to add to the tally of 
seven caps he won in 2008, but he has the hunger to do so and knows that
 the satisfaction will be all the greater if he makes it.

‘You
 don’t want it to be an easy ride,’ he said. ‘When it is tough, you have
 to keep working at it and there are obstacles to overcome, that’s when 
you feel like you have achieved something.’

To
 reach this point has been an achievement in itself. For so long, it 
felt as if Cipriani’s face didn’t fit; that he was a maverick who 
couldn’t be trusted. Clearing that hurdle has been the hardest part. Now
 he is in the England system again, his chance will surely come to prove
 that his instincts are suitably reliable these days.
