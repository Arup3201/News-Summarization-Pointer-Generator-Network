A retired barber accused of shooting a California urologist to death in his exam room suffered from prostate problems and was angry about his incontinence, according to neighbors.

Stanwood Fred Elkus, 75, was jailed on $1million bail after police say he shot Dr. Ronald Franklin Gilbert multiple times on Monday at a medical office in Newport Beach.

Police would not say if the 52-year-old Gilbert was Elkus' doctor, but the suspect’s neighbors said on Tuesday that the man was upset by a surgery that left him running to the bathroom constantly, sometimes in mid-conversation.

A retired barber accused of shooting a California urologist to death in his exam room suffered from prostate problems and was angry about his incontinence, according to neighbors.

Stanwood Fred Elkus, 75, was jailed on $1million bail after police say he shot Dr. Ronald Franklin Gilbert multiple times on Monday at a medical office in Newport Beach.

Police would not say if the 52-year-old Gilbert was Elkus' doctor, but the suspect’s neighbors said on Tuesday that the man was upset by a surgery that left him running to the bathroom constantly, sometimes in mid-conversation.

‘One day we were talking about other things outside and he says, “Oh hold it right there!” and he was rushing to his house and when he came back, he said, “I have a problem with my prostate,”’ recalled Miguel Soto, who lives across the street.

‘He said, “I had surgery and now I am worse than before the surgery.”’

Soto said Elkus never named his doctor, and Soto did not know if it was Gilbert.

A few weeks ago, Elkus said he would be away from home because he was checking into a hospital again, but when Soto saw him last week, he didn't mention his health.

Neighbor James Lord said Elkus mentioned Sunday that ‘he wasn't going to be around much longer.’‘I told him, “No Stan, you're gonna outlive me,”’ Lord said.

Police said on Monday, they found Elkus and Gilbert in a second-floor room after several 911 callers reported six or seven shots fired. A gun was found at the scene.

The doctor had been shot several times in the upper body and was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport Beach.

Victim: The slain doctor was identified as Ronald Gilbert, 52, who was a urologist in Newport Beach, California

Elkus had been undergoing treatment for prostate problems, neighbors told the Los Angeles Times.

He frequently visited Gilbert, neighbor James Lord said.

Dr Gilbert is also the founder and 
chief scientist at Absorption Pharmaceuticals LLC, the makers of a drug 
called Promescent, which is dedicated to curing premature ejaculation.

An autopsy was planned today and Elkus was scheduled to appear on Wednesday in court.

Police searched his home but declined to disclose what they found.

At Gilbert's home in Huntington Beach, mourners arrived as distraught family members and a rabbi went in and out of the house just blocks from the water. The family declined comment and asked a reporter to leave.

Gilbert, a married father-of-two, appeared to be the only target of the attack, police spokeswoman Kathy Lowe said.

Dr Jeffrey Lauber, a dermatologist, said he frequently referred patients with cancer symptoms to Gilbert.

'He's the best there is,' Lauber said. 'Not only is he a very good urologist, he's a pillar of the community.'

Lauber couldn't imagine why anyone would want to shoot Gilbert.

'This doesn't happen down here,' he said of the wealthy enclave 45 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

Gilbert dealt with general urology, sexual dysfunction and related surgical techniques including vasectomies, bladder and prostate cancer, according to his biography on the website of the Orange Coast Urology Group, which he joined in 1993.

One of his specialties involved using a laser to vaporize prostate tissue blocking the urinary tract. His biography called him a 'people person' and said he enjoys helping people.

He decided to become a doctor mainly because his father is a doctor, the biography said, adding that Gilbert had been a stockbroker and a singer in a rock band. He had worked for 20 years at Hoag Hospital and was its former urology chief.

Murder: A doctor was shot dead inside an examination room at a medical office near Hoag Hospital in Orange County

Lake Elsinore resident James Lord, Lord said Elkus forced him to take this tool off him and said: 'I might not be alive much longer'

Shooting: Police and medical personnel stand outside a medical office near Hoag Hospital where a doctor was killed on Monday afternoon

Tragedy: The gunman surrendered to cops inside the examination room and was taken into custody

The
 building and much of its parking lot were cordoned off with police tape
 and surrounded with many police vehicles several hours after the 
shooting.

Kristen Cotty, who works as an office
 supervisor at a lab on the third floor, said she thought the gunfire 
was construction noises.

'What's going on with the world 
today?' she told the Orange County Register. 'I mean, schools, now I got
 to worry about going to work. This has got to stop.'

Dr Gilbert is described in a bio on 
the Orange Coast Urology website as a 'people person' who 'treats his 
patients as if they are members of his own family.'
