Despite only taking control of North Korea in 2012, Kim Jong-Un has wasted no time exerting his authority with an iron fist and terrifying brutality.

While it's obvious such methods are influenced by his father Kim Jong-Il's reign of terror, this new picture reveals the lengths he goes to in an attempt to emulate his father's legacy.

A picture taken at the Jongsong Pharmaceutical General Factory in Pyongyang shows him dictating orders to his subordinates as they eagerly scribble down notes while listening to the young despot.

In the background, a photo on the wall shows Jong-Il conducting an identical tour some years previous, with his entourage following his every move just like those surrounding his son.

The undated photo was released by North Korea's Central News Agency.

It is believed that Jong-Un's reign in power is far more bloody and dangerous than that of his father's.

Jong-Il's former bodyguard recently said that the Kims required absolute loyalty and any suspicion of treachery was dealt with incredibly harshly.

After Jong-Il's death in 2012, people who were deemed not to have mourned intensely enough, were sent to a labour camp for six months.

In October 2013, it was reported that Jong-Un ordered the execution of his ex-girlfriend Hyon Song-Wol, who had a popular hit song in North Korea.

However, she appeared on North Korean state television in May delivering a speech.

Days after she reappeared in public, Kim ordered the execution of engineers and architects involved in the construction of a Pyongyang tower block which collapsed days earlier.

More than 500 people died in the collapse which was blamed on 'shoddy workmanship'. Jong-Un ordered the executions because he was 'unable to sleep after learning of the tragedy'.

He himself went missing from public view in early September, prompting claims that he may have been overthrown.

However, it is understood he underwent ankle surgery and reappeared in public after six weeks carrying a black cane.

Upon his return, it is believed he ordered the execution of six senior officials.
