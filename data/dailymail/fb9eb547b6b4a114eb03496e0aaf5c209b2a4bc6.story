Angel di Maria does not believe that Cristiano Ronaldo would make a sensational return to Manchester United.

Ronaldo made a devastating impact at Old Trafford during his six years at the club between 2003 and 2009 and his game has scaled new heights at Real Madrid.

However, speculation persists that he could yet be tempted to return to Manchester one day.

Angel di Maria says Cristiano Ronaldo is enjoying himself at Real Madrid and won't sign for Man United

The duo played together at the Bernabeu until Di Maria left for United last summer in a £60m move

Di Maria told Radio America: 'I don't think he will come back to Manchester. It is difficult to leave Madrid. It can happen, but I think that he is having a great time and I don't get the feeling that he wants a change.

The Argentine winger, who swapped Madrid for Manchester United in a club record £59.7m deal last summer, has also been taken aback by the quality of Wayne Rooney.

'Rooney is an impressive player,' Di Maria added, 'He has this quality, mentality and this hunger to play every game that is incomparable. He plays 90 minutes in every game. 

'He is always committed, giving everything in every match. It is he that has surprised me the most, with his hunger and how he commits to every game. He is a player that deserves to be here.'

Ronaldo has been linked with a switch back to Old Trafford ever since his departure in 2009
