For years wildlife experts have wondered why the tail of a rabbit is so bright compared to the rest of the animal's fur, and now researchers from Germany may have finally solved the mystery. 

But Dirk
Semmann, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Göttingen, claims the bright white tuft has evolved to distract and confuse predators.

He adds that because the tail moves and seems to vanish and reappear as the rabbit makes sharp turns, the predator is forced to re-focus each time, slowing the attacker down and giving the rabbit time to escape.

Researchers from Germany have discovered that rabbits, pictured, whose fur is predominantly designed to camouflage them in the wild, have a contrasting bright white cottontail to distract and confuse would-be predators. Previous theories thought the rump patch evolved for mating or to warn off rivals

The domestic rabbit is a descendant of the wild European rabbit.

Rabbits were introduced to Britain by the Romans who used their fur for clothes and ate their meat.

The earliest known records of rabbits in Britain were recorded in the 12th Century.

The European rabbit is found in the majority of Europe but has also been introduced to other countries, including New Zealand, Australia and Chile.

Wild rabbits lives in grassland, on coastal cliffs and woodland.  

Their coat has evolved to blend in with these environments and hide it from would-be predators.

Scientists previously thought the tail contrasted so drastically against its natural camouflage because it formed a key part of the rabbit's 
mating ritual.

Others believed it acted as a warning to rivals and other animals.

Semmann told Nature.com: 'The idea first appeared when I 
was running. I met this rabbit; it was always running 
and turning at some point.

'That got me thinking about the problem.'

Semmann asked 24 people
to play a video game that involved following a virutal rabbit as it made sharp turns left and right.

One rabbit had a flashing white tail while the other did not.

The players were then told to pinpoint the rabbit's location at each turn and determine which direction the animals were heading.

All the 'hunters' made the correct decisions within 0.5 
seconds in both games but when the rabbit had a tail, the number of correct calls were significantly reduced.

This lead Semmann to conclude that rabbits are more likely to survive when they have bright rump patches and this explains why these tails contrast against the rest of the animal's body.

The research found that by focusing on the tail, a would-be predator ignores 
the main body of the animal.

When the rabbit then makes a sharp 
turn, this focus point disappears and moves forcing the predator to re-focus on the animal.

This slows the predator down and gives the rabbit vital seconds to escape.

Semmann presented his findings at the Behaviour 2013 conference in Newcastle.
