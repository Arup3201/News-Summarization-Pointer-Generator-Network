Rescuers are desperately scouring a gold mine to locate the bodies of 83 miners who were engulfed in two million cubic metres of mud and rocks after a landslide in Tibet.

The bodies of two workers have already been recovered after the huge mass of debris swept through the mine, covering an area of 1.5 square miles.

More than 3,000 rescue workers were rushed to the scene in the mountainous Tibetan village of Gyam, Maizhokunggar county, agonisingly searching for more than 24 hours using diggers and sniffer dogs.

Mass: Around two million cubic metres of mud and rocks swept through the mine in Gyama, a village in Maizhokunggar county,Tibet, on Friday morning

Devastation: Firefighters carry the body of one worker to an ambulance

Struggle: Two bodies have been found after more than 36 hours since the incident, but rescuers are trying to locate the other 81 mine workers trapped

Wreck: A digger was mangled after the huge landslide at the site run by
Huatailong Mining Development, a subsidiary of the China National Gold Group Corporation

One body was found at 
5:35 p.m., nearly 36 hours after the landslide buried the workers, who were believed to have been sleeping in their
tents.

The rescuers were hampered when snow began to fall on Saturday afternoon, according to China's official Xinhua News Agency.

The miners had been working for Huatailong 
Mining Development, a subsidiary of the China National Gold Group Corporation,
a state-owned enterprise and the country's largest gold producer.

State media said that two of the buried workers are Tibetans and that two are women.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was 
on an official trip to Congo, and Premier Li Keqiang ordered authorities
to 'spare no efforts' in their rescue work, state media reported.

The incident at the mine - located around 45 miles east of Lhasa, the 
regional capita - immediately sparked debate about the safety of extensive mining activity on the Tibetan plateau.

Search: A team of 3,000 rescue workers has been sen to the area, using diggers, bulldozers and sniffer dogs in an attempt to finds the workers

into the darkness: The search is expected to continue into the night

Investigation: Officials in Beijing said the cause of the disaster is yet to be fully investigated, although state media said the mudslide was caused by a 'natural disaster'

Others took to social media to question whether the state-run excavation was excessive, but the comments were soon blocked by censors.

be fully investigated, although state media said the mudslide was caused 
by a 'natural disaster'.

Btan Tundop, a Tibetan resident, writing about the mining company's dominance of the area, said: 'The entire Maizhokunggar has been taken over by China National Gold 
Group. Local Tibetans say the county and the village might as well be 
called Huatailong'

Tibetan writer Tsering Woeser, who has
been following the mining development in Gyama and surrounding areas 
since 2007, said China's powerful and resource-hungry state-owned 
companies had ravaged the landscape.

Working hard: Rescuers work at the accident site as the sun begins to set

'Unchecked mining has polluted water, 
sickened animals and humans, dislocated herdsmen and now caused a 
massive mudslide,' Woeser wrote on her blog.

The Chinese government has been 
encouraging development of mining and other industries in isolated 
Tibet as a way to promote its economic growth and raise living 
standards.

The region has abundant deposits of copper, chromium, bauxite
and other precious minerals and metals, and is a hub for industrial development.

Tibet remains among China's poorest 
regions despite producing a large share of its minerals.
