After the week he has had, it is no surprise that David Cameron was looking for divine inspiration.

Hours after the Prime Minister was forced to defend Maria Miller’s resignation over her expenses, he told religious leaders at an Easter reception in Downing Street: ‘The Bible tells us to bear one another’s burdens.’

The stressed-out Premier was also seen leaning against a pillar with his eyes shut as a soprano sang the – rather appropriate –  hymn ‘Ave Maria’.

The Prime Minister asked church leaders if there were any volunteers to help bear his burdens

After spending a week defending Mrs Miller, Mr Cameron yesterday admitted he had learned the hard way that public anger over MPs' expenses is still 'raw'.

In the Commons he struggled to explain why he clung on to his Culture Secretary after she was ordered to repay £5,800 in over-claimed expenses and apologise to the Commons.

Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the PM of a 'terrible error of judgement' by refusing to sack Mrs Miller earlier, adding: 'He just doesn't get it.'

But by evening Mr Cameron was rather more
 philosophical, ignoring the advice of former Labour spin doctor 
Alastair Campbell that Downing Street does not 'do God'.

Hosting the Easter reception in Number
 10, he told church leaders how he finds ‘moments of greatest peace’ at 
Thursday morning services and even claimed Jesus was responsible for
 his ‘Big Society’ policy.

Soprano Laura Wilde sang Ave Maria for guests, before Mr Cameron addressed the audience.

The
 Prime Minister said: ‘The Bible tells us to bear one another’s burdens.

'After the day I’ve had, I’m definitely looking for volunteers.’

Mrs
 Miller was told on Tuesday night by an ‘emissary’ that senior Tories 
believed she should offer to resign for the good of the party.

She
 then had a late-night phone call with the Prime Minister as he was 
returning from the state banquet for the Irish president at Windsor 
Castle in which it was agreed she would quit.

Mrs
 Miller was ordered to repay £5,800 in overclaimed mortgage expenses and
 found to have broken the MPs’ code of conduct in her belligerent 
attitude towards the independent parliamentary standards commissioner.

The offence was compounded when the Culture Secretary delivered a curt 32-second apology in the Commons.

Allies
 of Mrs Miller claimed she had been the victim of a ‘witch-hunt’, in part
 fuelled by opposition to her policy to legalise gay marriage.

Mr Cameron made no reference to the issue in his speech, according to a Bloomberg report.

Instead he focussed on his own faith, and went further than he has before in describing the comfort he takes from the church.

He
 described Jesus Christ as ‘our saviour’ and said his ‘moments of 
greatest peace’ come ‘perhaps every other Thursday morning’ when he 
slips into the sung Eucharist at St. Mary Abbots, the church in 
Kensington, west London.

The
 church is linked to the school his children attend. He added: ‘I find a
 little bit of peace and hopefully a bit of guidance.’

Mr Cameron also spoke of the support he received from the church when his son Ivan died in 2009.

Mark Abrey, the vicar of at his local church, was the ‘person who looked after me’, Mr Cameron said.

‘I can’t think of anyone who was more loving or thoughtful or kind,’ he added.

The
 Big Society, to encourage more volunteering and social enterprise, 
was one of the flagship ideas of Mr Cameron’s Tory leadership.

Mr Cameron said Christians are now the most persecuted religion around the world

But the onset of the recession, and confusion about what it really meant, has sen it quietly dropped in recent years.

But last night Mr Cameron boasted: ‘Jesus invented the Big Society 2,000 years ago; I just want to see more of it.

‘If there are things that are stopping you from doing more, think of me as a giant Dyno-Rod’ to clear any blockages.

He went on: ‘It is the case that Christians are now the most persecuted religion around the world

‘We should stand up against persecution of Christians and other faith groups wherever and whenever we can.’
