It is the exercise increasingly favoured by those fed up with public transport and looking to take more exercise.

But riding a bike dramatically increases the risk of injury to the genitals and kidneys, a study has shown.

Cycling, and in particular the bike itself, cause a worrying amount of kidney and genitalia injuries especially among children, researchers say.

The study also found that 70 per cent of 
bike-related injuries to the kidneys and genitals were a result of 
direct contact with the bike, rather than falling off.

On yer bike: Cycling fans run a risk of injuring kidneys and genitals, with 4,000 people admitted to A&E every year in the U.S.

About 4,000 people visit U.S. emergency rooms for bicycle-related kidney and genital injuries each year, 61 per cent of which were males.

In a study published in the journal Injury Prevention, researchers analysed data collected by the U.S.’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System between 2002 and 2010.

Children were found to have sustained about ten times as many of these types of injuries as adults.

Still, adults' injuries more often required hospital admission. About 12 per cent of the adult ER visits in the study led to a hospital admission, compared to seven per cent of children's visits.

About 70 per cent of injuries resulted from direct contact with the bike, and in nearly half of those injuries, the culprit was the top tube that runs between the seat and the handlebars.

‘We were surprised that there were so 
many injuries related to bike riding,’ co-author Dr Benjamin Breyer, a 
urologist at the University of California, San Francisco said.

Dr. Breyer and his team separated the patients by age group and looked at whether each person had been subsequently admitted to the hospital, which would indicate a relatively severe injury. They excluded injuries that had been caused by a collision with a car.

Despite these data, the authors called the paper ‘exploratory,’ emphasizing that it shouldn't necessarily lead to changes in safety precautions.

‘Our data hasn't informed prevention strategies yet,’ said Breyer.

Although changes in a bicycle's design could potentially prevent some injuries, ‘you can't figure that out with this kind of study,’ he said.

Some experts argued that biking holds inherent risks, and that making changes to bicycles in light of so few major injuries isn't necessary.

‘Riding your bike safely is the most important thing. Wear a helmet, follow the rules of the road, and be alert and be visible,’ Breyer said.
