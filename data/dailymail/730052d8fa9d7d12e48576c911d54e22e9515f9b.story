Ministers have been accused of putting profit over human rights after organising a secretive arms fair to sell tear gas and rubber bullets to a host of authoritarian regimes.

The three-day 'Security & Policing Event', which is closed to the public and press, has been organised by the Home Office to showcase British anti-riot kit to dozens of foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Vladimir Putin's Russia

Sniper rifles, phone-hacking equipment and specialist 'sound guns' will be available to help foreign police control uprisings.

Ministers have organised an arms fair to sell anti-riot equipment to foreign governments including rubber bullets, like those used by police against protesters in Sao Paulo, Brazil last year 2014

The Government has publicised the event as a unique opportunity for arms manufacturers to market equipment 'which would be too sensitive to show in a more-open environment'.

Since the Coalition came to power in 2010, £15.9million worth of export licences for crowd-control have been approved by Vince Cable's Business Department.

This includes £10million of tear gas or 'anti-riot irritants', £640,000 of 'crowd-control ammunition' and £3.1million of riot shields.

Much of the kit is sold to democracies like France and the US. But crowd-control supplies have also been cleared for countries on the Government's own human-rights blacklist.

Nine of the countries to receive export approvals - Afghanistan, Bahrain, Colombia, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Pakistan, Russia and Saudi Arabia - feature or have featured on the Foreign Office's human rights blacklist of 'Countries of Concern' over the last five years.

The figures - compiled from Government data by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade - show that goods worth £6.7m were cleared for shipping to the nine countries between 2010 and last September.

Since the Coalition came to power it has signed off export licenses for anti-riot equipment to foreign regimes, including Libya under Muammar Gaddafi (left) and Valdimir Putin's Russia

Some £2.95m of tear gas was sold to Saudi Arabia and £228,000 of 'crowd-control ammunition' to Libya while Muammar Gaddafi remained in power, the Independent reported.

Andrew Smith, from CAAT, told the newspaper: 'This is a sign of a system that puts arms-company profits ahead of human rights. Weapons like tear gas have an indiscriminate effect and are synonymous with internal repression.

'The Government may have revoked the licence for tear gas to Libya, but it should never have been signed in the first place. Gaddafi was a brutal tyrant from day one, and this is a reminder that acts of oppression by his regime were carried out with British support.'

The government insists licences will not be granted when there is a 'clear risk' that the exports 'might be used to facilitate internal repression'.

In a statement, the Business Department said: 'We rigorously examine every licence application on a case-by-case basis against internationally recognised criteria.

'Risks around human rights abuses are a key part of our assessment and we do not grant licences where there is a clear risk that it might be used for internal repression.'
