Salvador Orozco, 48, has been detained in Hawaii in connection with a rape in Gateshead 23 years ago

A man wanted in connection with the brutal rape of a barmaid in Gateshead more than two decades ago has been arrested in Hawaii, it has been revealed.

U.S. police arrested Salvador Orozco, 48, after executing a warrant at an address in the popular tourist destination.

Cold-case detectives are now waiting for American officials to extradite Orozco to the UK where he will be questioned by officers.

Orozco is wanted in connection with an attack that happened on May 17, 1990, which saw a 20-year-old barmaid ambushed.

She was savagely attacked as she made her way home from work on Askew Road in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear.

She was dragged into a deserted yard and subjected to a horrific assault in which the attacker told her: 'My name is Sushi. I'm Japanese.'

A Home Office spokesman today confirmed they were waiting for officials in the US to send the suspect back to England for questioning.

He said: 'We can confirm Salvador Orozco was arrested on February 7 in Hawaii on a UK extradition warrant.

'He is wanted for alleged sexual offences dating back to 1990. The extradition process is now a matter for the US authorities.'

Orozco is alleged to have eluded authorities for more than two decades after fleeing the UK and heading for America and then Hawaii.

In July last year British Embassy officials contacted the US Justice Department in an effort to locate, arrest and extradite him to the UK.

American police today said he was wanted in Newcastle for one count of rape, one count of indecent assault and one other sexual offence.

And a Northumbria Police spokesman said there is an 'ongoing investigation' into the incident.

He said: 'We can confirm that an investigation is ongoing into the rape of a woman in Gateshead on May 17, 1990.

'We've been made aware that an arrest has been made in connection with the inquiry.'

Orozco was arrested 'without incident' at around 9pm last Thursday (FEB 7) at a property on Puunene Avenue, in the isolated Kahului area of Hawaii.

It came after law-enforcement agencies followed his tracks from America to the tropical island.
