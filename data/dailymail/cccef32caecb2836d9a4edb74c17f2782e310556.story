Hanged: Former PC Gareth Gricks, pictured, was found dead at his home in August

A shamed police officer who was dismissed for gross misconduct was found dead on the day he was due to be charged with sex offences.

Former PC Gareth Gricks, 53, was found hanged at his home in Dunton, Norfolk, by a family member.

Norfolk Police said that he was suspected of being involved in online sex abuse of children in South East Asia, and would use forums to make contact with young girls.

He was about to be charged with nine sex offences when he was found dead on 6 August this year, an inquest into his death heard.

The charges were three counts of 
arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence, one of making 
indecent images of children and five counts of sexual assault against a
woman.

Gricks is understood to have told his family some details about the investigation a few days earlier.

The divorcee, who has adult children, was arrested at his home after returning from a holiday in Thailand in July and was then dismissed from the force for gross misconduct.

The child sex offences are thought to relate to victims between the ages of 10 and 16. The sexual assault was committed in the UK.

Officers also found more than 100 indecent images on Gricks's computer - though they have confirmed that none of the offences was committed while he was on duty.

A death notice published in a regional paper five days after Gricks died described him as 'a dearly-loved dad, granddad, son and brother, 
who will be sadly missed by all his family and friends.'

He had a profile on a dating website, where he called himself laid-back and romantic.

Misconduct: Gareth Gricks was dismissed from Norfolk Police in response to the allegations

It said: 'I work shifts
and have plenty of time off for travelling during the week or weekends,
so don't worry about distance! I am romantic and like to eat out or chill out at home.'

Temporary
Assistant Chief Constable Nick Dean said: ‘Norfolk Constabulary took 
immediate action on being notified of the officer’s suspected criminal 
activity.

Norfolk Police 
said that he would have had some contact with children during his 
duties, but never worked in a role related specifically related to young
offenders or child sex abuse victims in his 20-year policing career.

‘As a result of his death, there can be no criminal prosecution and the investigation, effectively, ceases.

‘However, in recognition of his role and the serious nature of the offences he was due to face, it is right and proper that this information is placed in the public domain, not only to demonstrate police action but also to give victims of sexual abuse a voice when this cannot be achieved through the judicial process.'
