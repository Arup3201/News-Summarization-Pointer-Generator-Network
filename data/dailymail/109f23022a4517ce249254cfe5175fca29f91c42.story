Before the assault:  Sasha Jenkins was a on a quiet night out with a friend when she was attacked

Police have released shocking photographs of a woman knocked unconscious in an unprovoked assault. 

Sasha Jenkins, 28, was walking with a friend in Staple Hill, Bristol, at 12.45am on July 5, after leaving the White Swan pub in Downend.

Two men walked towards the carer and one suddenly punched her to the ground as he passed.

She was rushed to Southmead Hospital with severe facial injuries and later underwent a ‘painful’ operation.

WDC Clare Chipping, of Avon and Somerset Police, said the ‘horrific’ pictures had been released in a bid to identify her attacker. 

‘Sasha wants to release these photos of her before and after the attack to show the horrific nature of the injuries she suffered,’ WDC Chipping said.

‘She’s had to endure a painful operation and will need further treatment in the days and weeks ahead.

‘At the moment she’s taking time off from her job as a carer because she’s had to wear a protective mask as part of her treatment.

‘We don’t have a description of the two men who approached Sasha other than that they were young men.

‘We have carried out a number of inquiries already and now want to issue an appeal for anyone who witnessed this incident to come forward.

‘I am convinced there will be people who know who is responsible and I would urge them to put aside any misguided loyalty and contact us.’

A 31-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident and is on bail until August 24, she added.

Miss Jenkins said the last thing she remembers is two men crossing the road towards her while she walked a friend towards a taxi rank.

One of the yobs smashed his fist into the side of her face, instantly knocking her out so that she fell into the road.

She woke up in a pool of blood after her attackers fled empty handed.

The punch was so hard it has left the single mum-of-one with a half-centimetre hole in her septum and her nose was smashed into pieces.

Her front tooth was knocked out and she had cuts and bruises all over her legs as well as a huge lump on her head.

Speaking today, the support worker said: ‘We were just walking along and all I was thinking about was getting home to bed because I was tired.

‘The last thing I remember is these two guys walking towards us and crossing the road towards us.

‘The next thing I remember is the police asking me to sit on a step.

‘He punched me to the side of my face so hard that I have a 5mm hole in the middle of my nose.

‘There was a huge puddle of blood.

‘It broke my nose and usually they just break it back but they couldn't because it was just crumpled to pieces.

‘I had to have a two and a half hour operation and wear a face cast for two weeks. It is still really, really tender now, and I might need another operation later.

‘There is going to be swelling for six to twelve months.’

Miss Jenkins, who has a five-year-old daughter, said: ‘It has really shaken me up to be honest.

‘The worst thing was my daughter seeing me. I told her 'mummy fell down' because I don't want her knowing a man did this to me.

‘I think the person who did this to me is just scum. How could they do this to someone? I've never been in a fight in my life.’
