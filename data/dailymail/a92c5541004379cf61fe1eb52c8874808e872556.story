Anxiety: Former TOWIE star Kirk Norcross suffers from panic attacks

For someone with a history of anxiety, a career in reality television might seem inadvisable. But for The Only Way Is Essex star Kirk Norcross, appearing in the Bafta-winning series helped him finally confront his mental health problems.

After watching his reality-show colleagues talking about his split from girlfriend and co-star Lauren Pope, Kirk suffered the latest in a string of full-blown panic attacks – and knew he had to seek help.

‘In one episode of the last series the cast had all gone to Marbella without me and Lauren was saying rude things about me and our break-up,’ recalls the 25-year-old.

‘Suddenly, I couldn’t breathe. I must have blacked out because the next thing I knew, I was slumped on the sofa and the show was over.’

Chronic anxiety – a psychological condition that often causes panic attacks – affects one in six adults.

Kirk has had the problem since childhood, but when his episodes increased in number and severity, he sought a diagnosis.

‘Being on TV brought out all my insecurities and paranoia,’ he explains. ‘A panic attack always starts with feeling like someone is trying to belittle me.’

Other recent attacks have been brought on after reading derogatory comments about himself on social media sites such as Twitter.

‘I feel trapped and crushed and small – it’s like a tiny tennis ball is in the middle of my chest and getting bigger and bigger,’ he reveals.

‘My breaths get shorter. Then I think I’m going red and everyone can notice, and my hands start tingling. I go dizzy and light-headed and think I’m going to have a heart attack, pass out or die.’

Anxiety pervades Kirk’s everyday life. During our interview, he fidgets constantly, and he talks so quickly that the words tumble over each other.

In contrast, on TOWIE he comes across as a brash, flash, ladies’ man. But the brashness, he says, is all an act, and harks back to his teenage years when he would intentionally seek confrontation.

‘At times I knew a panic attack was coming and the only way to relieve it was to shout at the person putting me in that position. It often ended in a fight.’

On-screen style: Kirk never showed his anxiety to costars Billie and Sam Faiers, left and far right, and Lauren Goodger, but kept a confident front

That instinct – to fight – is one of two classic responses. The other – flight – is more common. ‘Adrenaline is a hormone that evolved in humans to help us fend off danger, either by attacking or running away fast,’ explains psychotherapist Matthew Stinson.

Adrenaline causes the blood pressure to rise, the heart to beat faster and superficial blood vessels to constrict, thus preparing the body for action.

‘The problem with anxiety disorders is that the same hormonal response to physical danger arises in situations that are not dangerous,’ adds Stinson. The disorder is usually fuelled by a ‘storm’ of anxious thoughts.

‘Sufferers have an initial panicky feeling, which triggers adrenaline release. In turn, this prompts a physical reaction such as sweating or palpitations, which then alerts them that something alarming is going on, and it makes them panic more,’ says Stinson.

Trigger: Kirk suffered a panic attack when ex Lauren Pope discussed their breakup on the show

‘They can then feel out of control, terrified about what’s happening to their mind and body, and the panic escalates.’

The good news is that there are plenty of ways to manage, prevent and overcome such attacks.

‘The trick,’ says Stinson, ‘is to identify anxiety in its earliest stage, challenge the thoughts provoking it, reassure yourself, and slow your breathing so the body stops thinking it’s in danger.’

With practice, many people can achieve
 this transformation themselves, although others opt for psychotherapy, 
particularly cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

This is the most 
effective treatment as the therapist can teach sufferers how to halt the
 downward spiral.

Kirk 
traces his problems to when his parents separated when he was five years
 old. From then on, his main contact with his father was talking on the
 telephone – something Kirk always found upsetting.

‘It sounds silly, 
but I couldn’t talk to someone I couldn’t see in case they were laughing
 at me.’

During adolescence,
 Kirk’s anxieties spread, and he suffered his first panic attack, aged 
18, in a clothes shop.

‘I went to return an item and the assistant said,
 “Sorry, you need the receipt.” I felt everyone was looking at me. I 
went bright red, started panicking, and ran out. I still can’t return 
clothes – I have a wardrobe full of things that don’t fit.’

Another
 trigger came when he started doing personal appearances as TOWIE’s 
popularity grew – standing in front of a club full of people filled him 
with dread.

Eventually, Kirk sought help through a CBT therapist. ‘I only went four times but he made me visualise crowds giving me a positive reception. He taught me to slow down my breathing and, even if I feel scared, to grab the bull by the horns and do it anyway. It really helped.’

Last year Kirk started playing the piano and also discovered another surprising pastime that helps keep him calm – baking. ‘I love it!’ he beams.

Now with a clutch of coping mechanisms, Kirk feels his anxiety is nearly under control and is tired of hiding his problem. ‘I don’t want to put on a front any longer. I’ve had enough of pretending – it’s a prison.’
