Anyone who has visited a medium, and been astounded by their psychic abilities, will go away wondering the same question: How on earth did they know that?

Well, it’s bad news for believers, as one man has gone to extreme lengths to lift the lid on ‘psychics,’ revealing the tricks they use to con innocent people out of thousands of pounds and give them false hope.

In his book, Psychic Blues: Confessions of a Conflicted Medium, Mark Edward, 62, from Los Angeles, explains how he became a spirit medium and psychic entertainer, then later used these skills to ‘scam the scammers.’

Mark Edward appeared on This Morning to reveal the scams and tricks that 'psychic' healers use on innocent people

'I saw how easy it was and saw it happening. I thought; "If they can do it I can,"' says Mark Edward of his book Psychic Blues: Confessions of a Conflicted Medium

Mark started his 25-year career in the 'magic of the mind industry', performing in clubs, theatres, and at many corporate events. He says his act was entertainment-based and that he never promised he had genuine magical or spiritual powers.

Talking to Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield on This Morning, Edward explained how he used his skills to infiltrate those that did claim to have these gifts.

He said: ‘People want answers. I saw how easy it was and saw it happening. I thought; “If they can do it, I can.”’

Philip Schofield questions Mark Edward on his expose of psychics and mediums on This Morning, as part of their Supernatural Week

‘So that’s where the ideas came to get in, to infiltrate and write the book to expose it.

‘I realised the power of charisma and suggestion. I learned about giving readings.’

Edward
 unveils the scams that thousands of psychics use, including ‘Cold 
Reading,’ where mediums claim to have superior psychic knowledge but 
it’s actually based on nothing at all.

By
 examining their client’s body language and observing what Edward says 
are their, ‘random generalities,’ the mediums can quite easily find that
 person’s vulnerability. ‘Once you get the hook, everything else falls 
into place,’ he said. ‘It’s all pretty standard stuff.’

The more recent trend of seeing a psychic over Skype throws up another common scam that many people aren’t aware of.

In
 the US the customer will pay in advance by credit card for the psychic 
session, upon which the ‘psychic’ on the other end will not only receive
 the money but be able to see the payer’s itemised credit card history.

They can use this information to make themselves seem more credible. If someone tells you they know exactly 
where you brought that new pair of shoes last week, you’d be forgiven 
for thinking they were genuine.

Fortunately for Brits, whilst the scam is
 common practice and perfectly legitimate in the US, using credit card 
details in this way is illegal in the UK.

Fraud? By examining their client's body language, Mark Edward says medium's can assess their personality and 'hook' them in

‘It’s not a gift,’ says Edward. ‘It’s maybe a skill. I call it fraud.

‘I have met people who are very intuitive and sensitive but there is nothing supernatural about them. They just assess information that most people don’t think about.’

He also explained how he held séances for purposes of the book, to prove how easy they are to create the illusion that there are supernatural powers.

‘It’s a lot about darkness,’ he said. ‘In pitch black you can suggest all sorts of things.

‘Linking hands creates incredible tension. People want stuff to happen. It’s easy to feel a cold breeze or tap on the shoulder and think no one is in the room. It’s a simple but traditional con.’

Edward justified what he did, saying that performing at an event or children’s birthday party and charging money for the entertainment was one thing, but giving people false hope and leading them to believe things that they actually had no claim over was very different.

‘It’s ok to go to a party and get a palm reading, you don’t expect them to get a hook in you,’ he said.

‘But you’re told that you need another reading, you need to buys this candle, it’s a scam.’
