We're more accustomed to seeing her posing in a skimpy bikini but Amy Willerton proves she can do ladylike too in her latest fashion shoot.

The 21-year-old reality TV star, who recently signed to top agency Models 1, looks sophisticated in a photoshoot for fashion e-tailer Brand Alley.

Wearing a vintage Ossie Clark dress, Amy looks chic and stylish with her tumbling blonde hair worn loose.

All white! Amy Willerton, who found fame on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, looks ethereal in her latest modelling shoot for Brand Alley

Amy is helping promote the website's first-ever Show Garden at the Chelsea Flower Show, which is inspired by the romantic style of 16th century Italian gardens.

The luxury online retailer invited Amy to wear this one-off 70's gown to encapsulate the sophistication and glamour of the Italian Renaissance Garden.

This shoot is a far cry from the I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here star's look yesterday, when she 
stepped out in just her underwear at the show.

She's bringing sexy back: Amy, 21, shows off her tanned and toned back as she models the vintage gown in the Italian inspired garden

The
 model was hard to miss as she perched in a huge white shell to recreate
 Sandro Botticelli's The Birth Of Venue painting in the Renaissance 
Garden exhibition.

With Rapunzel-like locks to protect her modesty, the 21-year-old 
posed in the tranquil setting while wearing a pale yellow bra and lacy 
knickers.

The
 model attracted a hoard of photographers on the first day 
of the annual show.

She tweeted earlier in the day to say: '@brandalleyUK have made me into RAPUNZEL #chelseaflowershow'.

Meanwhile,
 Amy has recently been signed to top London modelling agency, Models 1, 
who also have models Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Twiggy and Amber Le Bon 
on their books.

Professional: Amy has just signed onto Models 1's books and it seems she's proving her worth already

Elegant: BrandAlley, the luxury online retailer, invited Amy to wear this one-off 70's inspired original gown to emulate the sophistication and glamour of the Italian Renaissance Garden

She
 will mainly focus on commercial modelling opportunities in the UK but 
no doubt she will also be hoping to land work in the US and will divide 
her time between the two locations.

Speaking 
about her news, Amy said: 'This is an amazing opportunity to be signed 
to a top international agency like Models 1 who have some of the biggest
 models in the world on their books.

'They
 have some exciting modelling work and fashion shoots already in the 
pipeline and I'm really looking forward to the challenge.'

What a difference: The model looked a little less glamorous as she perched in a huge white shell to recreate Sandro Botticelli's The Birth Of Venue painting in the Renaissance Garden exhibition
