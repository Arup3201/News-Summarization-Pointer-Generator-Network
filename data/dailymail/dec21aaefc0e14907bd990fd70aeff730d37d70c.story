Dr Phil has been spotted playing an honored role in a Californian same-sex wedding ceremony between a celebrity-artist and his interior designer partner.

The smiling talk show host, 63, walked his friend Neal Wagner, 40, down the aisle - in place of the groom's father who passed away - before he married Thomas Piscitello in a lavish service at the Vibiana church in downtown Los Angeles.

One guest likened the ceremony to the wedding scene between Sex and The City characters Stanford Blatch and Anthony Marantino, describing it as 'over the top but amazing,' according to TMZ.

Dr Phil is said to have attended the wedding with his wife Robin Jameson, 61, and his sons Jay, 35, and Jordan, 28, and is a friend and client of the couple; who run an interior design company together.

Mr Wagner is an artist, whose paintings grace the homes of Rhianna and Rebecca Romijn, amongst others, while Mr Piscitello is a designer who has worked with Fendi.

The pair launched Mogul, their 'high-fashion home design store' in 2005, and Dr Phil is said to have enlisted their interior design services.

Dr Phil is a well-documented supporter of same-sex marriage.

Last year, he appeared on the Late Show David Letterman, where he spoke out to people who were intolerant of gay couples.

'I think they see it and say well, "if this person is allowed to have this role then are they gonna be all around me in my life?" And the answer is, yeah. Get used to it,' he said frankly.
