Victims of the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti are suing the United Nations for billions of dollars in damages over claims it was triggered when sewage from infected peacekeepers was discharged into the water system.

Human rights lawyers claim the epidemic, which has killed around 8,300 people and made more than 650,000 ill, came from contaminated waste from a UN barracks.

Scientific studies have shown that the disease was likely introduced to the country by troops from Nepal, where the cholera is endemic.

Forensic test linked the spread to a flawed sanitation system at the base, which contaminated a tributary that feeds Haitiâ€™s largest river, which is used by Haitians for drinking and bathing.

The decision to file the lawsuit at a New York court comes after the UN said earlier this year that it would not pay compensation and insisted that it was immune from such claims.

However, a UN official yesterday made a rare case for compensation for the victims.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay didn't say who she thought should pay, but activists have demanded the world body provide compensation to the victims of a disease believed brought in by U.N. peacekeepers.

'I have used my voice both inside the United Nations and outside to call for the right - for an investigation by the United Nations, by the country concerned, and I still stand by the call that victims of - of those who suffered as a result of that cholera be provided with compensation,' Pillay said at an awards ceremony for human rights activists in Geneva.

Pillay's remarks, streamed live on the Internet, were a rare admission by a U.N. official about the need to provide compensation.

Lawyers are filing the suit in the U.S. District Court in New York's Southern District.

The Boston-based Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti (IJDH), which has filed the suit, said in a statement: 'The plaintiffs include Haitians and Haitian Americans who contracted cholera themselves as well as family members of those who died of the disease.'

Cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.

It
has a short incubation period, from less than one day to five days, and
produces an enterotoxin.

Tthat causes a copious, painless, watery 
diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if 
treatment is not promptly given.

Vomiting also occurs in most patients.

An independent panel appointed by U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to study the epidemic issued a 2011 
report that did not determine conclusively how the cholera was 
introduced to Haiti.

But the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that evidence 
strongly suggested U.N. peacekeepers from Nepal were the source.

Cholera is an infection causing severe diarrhea that can lead to dehydration and death. It occurs in places with poor sanitation.

In November 2011, the IJDH filed a petition at UN headquarters in New York seeking a minimum of $100,000 for the families or next-of-kin of each person killed by cholera and at least $50,000 for each victim who suffered illness or injury from cholera.

Ban's spokesman Martin Nesirky said in 
February of this year that the world body advised the representatives of
the cholera victims that 'the claims are not receivable pursuant to 
Section 29 of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities.'

Outbreak: The lawsuit claims UN troops discharged contaminated sewage from a barracks

Under Section 29 the United Nations is required to make provisions for 'appropriate modes of settlement' of private law disputes to which the world body is a party or disputes involving a U.N. official who enjoys diplomatic immunity.

The IJDH said at the time it was disappointed by the U.N. decision and would pursue the case in court.

It was not immediately clear how the issue of diplomatic immunity for the United Nations would impact the lawsuit being being filed in the New York court.

Ban launched a $2.2 billion initiative in December 2012 to stamp out cholera over the next decade in Haiti.

The UN's Stabilization Mission in Haiti has been in operation since June 1, 2004, to assist with security in the politically volatile country following the resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

It has also been providing extensive assistance since the devastating earthquake of 12 January 2010, which resulted in more than 220,000 deaths.
