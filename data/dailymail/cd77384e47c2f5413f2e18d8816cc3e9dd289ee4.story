The Android Chorus in action: 300  phones and tablets singing and dancing together - all running Google's software

Each phone was programmed to have its own Android character, and sing its own part of the song.

'A lot of people play music on their phones,' Google Japan's Head of Device Marketing Yuko Akiyama, said in a blog post. 

'But what about using those phones to make music?

'Over in Tokyo, the Google Japan team gave it a go — stringing together 300 smartphones and tablets with 300 different characters singing the same song using only the device speakers. 

'We call it 'Android Chorus.''

The video shows the team painstakingly programming each handset and setting them up on large desks, before finally transferring them to a giant display wall. 

'If you happen to be in Tokyo, you can see the chorus perform from Thursday, February 12 to Sunday, February 15 at Omotesando Hills,' Google says.

'300 different characters singing in perfect harmony is just another illustration of how Android is about Being together not the same'

The video begins with a single handset singing a song.

Every screen has a different Android character, which moves in time to the music.
