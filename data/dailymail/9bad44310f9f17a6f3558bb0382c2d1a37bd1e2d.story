A Michigan man diagnosed with stage four liver cancer has been granted a dying wish to marry his fiancee, after doctors said it was unlikely he would survive the next week.

Daniel Robertson, 63, of Port Huron, only discovered he had cancer in early January, when doctors told him he had between three and six months to live.

He and his fiancee, Leeanna, 46, who he met online in 2009, quickly started planning a wedding - setting a date for February 27.

But as Robertson's health took a sharp decline, making him reliant on a wheelchair, doctors said it was unlikely he would make it to next Friday.

Dying wish: Doctors say Daniel Robertson, who is battling liver cancer, now has only days to live. On Wednesday he married his fiancee Leeanna in the Marysville hospice that is caring for him

Overjoyed: For Leeanna Robertson, the occasion was bittersweet, knowing she will soon have to say goodbye to her husband

Big day: Nurses at Blue Water Hospice Home managed to pull the wedding together in 24 hours

Celebration: Staff managed to get the cake, flowers and a hair stylist donated by local businesses 

Staff at Blue Water Hospice Home in Marysville quickly stepped in, and were able to bring the nuptials forward in just 24 hours.

'We take care of the whole patient here,' Robertson's nurse, Jean Flint, told The Detroit Free Press.

'One of his goals in life was to get married, so we wanted to make that happen.'

Luckily, Leeanna already had the wedding dress, so the nurses organized for a cake and flowers to be donated, and brought in a hair stylist from a local salon.

The St. Clair County clerk also waived the three-day waiting period required when applying for a marriage license.

The couple were married on Wednesday.

'While I was excited to finally be marrying him, I was heartbroken,' the bride told The Detroit Free Press.

Bridesmaid: The bride is seen here with her 26-year-old daughter, Angel Maushund

Congratulations: The couple said their dream was to marry each other - and on Wednesday they finally did

'As I walked down the aisle I just thought he still looked so good and I was so happy to see him standing.'

While Robertson has lost alot of his strength and is having trouble breathing, he was in great spirits for the big day. 

'I'm feeling fantastic today,' he said.

'As she walked down the aisle I was thinking, ''What took her so darn long to get ready?''

'She had me waiting at the altar for her.'

For his now-wife, it was bittersweet - finally getting married, but knowing she is about to lose her husband just as quickly.

'I have finally married my true love and my soul mate,' Leeanna said.

'We wanted to do nothing else but get married.'
