Three people hospitalised after eating marijuana-laced chocolate bars at the Denver County Fair's 'Pot Pavilion' claim not to have known the chocolate contained drugs.

The festival-goers said that they got more than they bargained for when they ate the chocolate bar at the fair in Colorado and became unwell and had to be rushed to hospital.

Denver County Fair spokesperson, Dana 
Cain confirmed that at least two people went to the hospital after they 
became dizzy, sick and confused.

An investigation has been launched into the incident but officials said that the pot-laced 
chocolate was not supposed to have any drugs in it, despite being sold 
at a pavilion featuring contests including Blue Ribbon for 'Best 
Marijuana Plant.'

In a press release prior to the event, organisers said 'in compliance with Denver’s new laws, there will be no marijuana allowed on the premises during this event.'

On January 1st, the state of Colorado began 
allowing the sale of recreational marijuana to anyone aged 21 or older. 
Residents can legally buy an ounce of cannabis.

According to the law, you are not allowed to smoke pot in public, or even a pot shop which is governed by the state's Clean Indoor Air Act. Pot users must smoke in private properties, with the owner's permission.

However, Jordan Coombs and Richard Jones, of Arvada are among the three men who wound up in hospital after they ate the pot-laced bar.

Mr Jones told 7NEWS that he ate the full-melt chocolate bar from LivWell and became sick shortly afterwards.

‘I
 was given one of these, it looked just like that,’ he told the station.

He said: ‘They
 were giving out samples and they made sure to tell us that the samples 
are just a sample of their chocolate, that doesn’t have any THC in it, 
and the guy went so far as to let us know if we came into the store, the
 ones in the store would taste different.’

An hour after consuming the 
chocolate bar Mr Jones said he became dizzy and had to sit down. He 
describes becoming sweaty and nauseous and was afraid he was having a 
heart attack.

Ambulance crews attended to one man on site before he was transferred to hospital.

Tests at the hospital revealed he had more than 100 nanograms of THC in 
his system, or about 20 times the legal driving limit.

‘I essentially ate 10 doses at once, never having THC in my system ever before,’ Mr Jones added.

The Pot Pavilion was
 a new attraction at Denver Fair this year and featured blue ribbon competitions for 'speed rolling' and stalls with 'pot-related merchandise' among other things.

Colorado became the first
 state in the nation to open recreational pot stores and the 
first place in the world where marijuana will be regulated from seed to 
sale.

Medical marijuana has been legal in the state since 2000.

LivWell said in a statement to 7NEWS: 'We
 are aware that someone made a complaint to 7NEWS alleging that 
chocolate samples distributed at the Denver County Fair contained 
cannabis. 

'If this occurred it was without our knowledge and was not 
sanctioned by our company.  We are currently investigating the matter.’

Mr Jones, wants his medical expenses reimbursed.

He contacted Denver police, but said that they did not offer much help.

He angrily claimed that if this had happened to the chief of police's 21-year-old daughter much more would have been done.
