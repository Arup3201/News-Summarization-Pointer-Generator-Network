When looking for a thrill or a rush of excitement, people do things like take spontaneous cross-country road trips, go bungee jumping, or, if they’re really brave, go skydiving.

But for renowned skier and base jumper Erik Roner, excitement is nothing less than being airlifted in a lawn chair by 90 balloons and shooting his way down with a shotgun.

Yes, you read that correctly. In his latest trick, the extreme sportsman from Tahoe City, California, used 50 tanks of helium to create a quirky piece of flying kit. The airship draws on the one crafted by widower Carl Fredricksen  in the Disney film, Up.

Stunt: Renowned skier, BASE jumper, and Nitro Circus member Erik Roner's last stunt involved a lawn chair, 90 balloons, a parachute and a shotgun

Flying high: Roner attached 90 balloons to a lawn chair and ascended 8,000 feet into the air

Source of inspiration: The airship draws on the one crafted by Carl Fredricksen in the Disney film, Up.

Friends and family helped Roner  to attach dozens of brightly-colored balloons to a lawn chair using a bungee cord - but not without losing a few  along the way. 

A video of the stunt shows Roner ascending thousands of feet above the Utah desert as he casually sits back in the lawn chair.

While he places one elbow on an arm rest he holds a shotgun under the other.

There are cameras attached to his clothing and his friends are also seen filming from below.

'Wow. It really doesn't get much more peaceful than this,' Roner says when he reaches 8,000 feet.

At that moment he pulls out the shotgun and starts shooting at the balloons to start his descent.

Then, once at a suitable elevation, he detaches the chair from the cluster of balloons and begins skydiving. The shotgun remains in his hand.

He soon deploys his parachute and floats safely to the ground, his trick successful.
