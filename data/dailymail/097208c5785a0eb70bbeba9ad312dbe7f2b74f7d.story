Samantha Brick today weighed into the debate on whether obese people should pay more to fly.

The size 12 frequent flyer said she would be 'furious' if she had to pay more to cover the cost of fuel needed to power a plane made heavier by fat passengers.

'Planes go in the air using fuel and that
 fuel is calculated on the weight of cargo and passengers. If we are all
 getting bigger then we need to pay more to pay for the fuel,' she said on Daybreak this morning.

Weighty issue: Samantha Brick, right, debated with plus size model Verity Brown over whether obese people should pay more for flights

The size 12 writer said: 'If someone is overweight and it is going to cost them more to get to their destination then they should pay more'

'If someone is overweight and it is going to cost them more to get to their destination then they should pay more,' she added.

Samantha's comments came in response to the opinions of plus size model Verity Brown. She argued that rather than charging obese people extra to fly, airlines should make their seats wider in order to accommodate larger passengers. 

Debate: Verity said airlines should accommodate larger passengers but Samantha said they should lose weight

Who's right? Verity said a fat tax is discrimination but Samantha doesn't believe she should pay more to cover the cost of fuel needed to power a plane made heavier by obese people

Verity, 37, from Birmingham said: 'A lot of people I know have had quite degrading experiences in terms of feeling embarrassed when they have to ask for a seat belt extension. I've never had an issue in terms of fitting in a seat so I think the idea of having to pay per weight is ridiculous.'

'I would be furious if my flight prices went up to 
accommodate the fact a certain part of the population are getting bigger'

Asked whether she thinks obese people should pay for a second seat, she replied: 'I don't need a second seat, slightly larger people may benefit from it. What we need to realise is people are getting bigger - not just around the waist.

'In the last 100 years people on average are four inches bigger so the airlines need to recognise that and be more customer-focused and start accommodating their passengers not just charging more money.'

Writer Samantha, 42, who lives in France, said she did not agree with Verity's view.

She said: 'Not all of us are getting bigger, I fly frequently
 for work and I would be furious if my flight prices went up to 
accommodate the fact a certain part of the population are getting bigger.'

Opposing views: Verity said pay per weight is ridiculous but Samantha thinks it's fair

She added: 'Our society thinks we have a
 god given right to fly, to eat what we like and not to exercise and 
everyone else is going to pay for us, that's just wrong.'

Samantha argued that rather than expecting other people to pay more for their flights or calling on airlines to provide wider seats, overweight people should instead consider losing weight.

She cited her own example having been overweight as a child and that of a friend who she  said has never felt better since shedding the pounds.

She explained: 'I was big as a child 
and it doesn't feel very nice. One of my friends used to need an 
extended seat belt (on a plane). She said the best feeling in the world 
is going 
from being clinically obese to normal weight and that not having to ask 
for seat belt has changed her life.'

Samoa Air recently became the world's first airline to institute a 'pay-by-weight' system, where the weight of a passenger and their luggage determines fare price

Verity questioned where the line is drawn over a fat tax given a body builder isn't obese but still weighs more than the average person.

'This is price discrimination, you can't charge a fat person more money for the same service'

She said: 'Muscle is denser than fat so body builders and athletes are not seen as fat so it's a fine line. This is price discrimination, you can't charge a fat person more money for the same service.'

The debate was discussed on the ITV breakfast show after Samoa Air recently became the world's first airline to institute a 'pay-by-weight' system, where the weight of a passenger and their luggage determines fare price.

Their chief executive Chris Langton said this was the 'fairest' way to charge travellers while addressing the obesity crisis - an acute problem in Samoa's Pacific region.

Another carrier, Southwest Airlines requires its 'customers of size' who do not fit between the armrests to purchase another seat.

In a November 2012 report on the issue, Dr Bharat Bhatta from Norway's Sogn og Fjordane University College said that a 'fat tax' is the way to price tickets 'correctly'.

He said: 'The model can be technically and economically feasible to implement and its proper implementation may provide significant benefits to airlines, passengers and society at large, not just economic transfers.'
