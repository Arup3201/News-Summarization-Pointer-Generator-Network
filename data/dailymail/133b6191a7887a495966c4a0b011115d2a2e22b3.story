It's certainly one of the more novel excuses for poor service.

The owners of a Lake District cafe who were branded ‘unwelcoming’ by their customers have hit back –  by saying that Northerners are meant to be rude.

Customers took to the TripAdvisor website to complain about the surly attitude of staff at Temporary Measure in Keswick, Cumbria.

Slapped down: Emma Smalley, 33, wrote that her brother John, 24, (left) is 'surly' as she slapped down a TripAdvisor user who left her Temporary Measure tea room in Keswick, Cumbria, a negative review

But the Smalley family, who run the 
tea rooms, have responded to each criticism, saying those in the North 
‘enjoy a good curmudgeon’.

Emma Smalley, 33, even added: 'If you want bad service, you should try me on for size.'

One customer complained in a review of the cafe last week: 'We won't be back because the proprietor made us feel so unwelcome. It was like he was having to work on his day off, enough said.

'We all have off days, so we went back the next day. But he was exactly the same.'

Emma, who runs the tearoom with her brother John, 24, and mother Jacqui, said that her sibling is always moody.

Tea room: Temporary Measure in Keswick, Cumbria, which was criticised by a reviewer on TripAdvisor

Negative review: A TripAdvisor user wrote that the 'proprietor' - which was John Smalley, 24, made them feel 'unwelcome'

Slapped down: Emma Smalley, who runs the tea rooms, wrote that her brother 'does not possess a sunny disposition' in her response to the negative review

In her response, she wrote: 'The many 
things that you took the time to write about the shop that you enjoyed 
and appreciated are completely eradicated in your review by your dislike
of the fact that my brother does not possess a sunny disposition.

'He just doesn't. Some people don't. He's not mean or patronising or aggressive, he's just quiet.

'Luckily we live in Britain, in particular The North, a place that still maintains a healthy respect for a good old fashioned surly disposition. We enjoy a good curmudgeon.

'Clearly you don't, which is perfectly fine and understandable - whatever floats all our strange little boats, but it doesn't quite seem healthy to me that your entire enjoyment of an experience be so dependent on the fact that me and my sisters got most of the sunny disposition genes.'

Ms Sellers added that her brother has 'got the best coffee-making genes by a mile' - and jokingly added that he is a much better waiter than she is.

Positive: The tea rooms in Keswick, Cumbria, have largely excellent reviews on TripAdvisor

She wrote: 'If
you want bad service, you should try me on for size - this weekend I 
delivered two teapots without teabags in and accidentally threw a fork 
at a woman. It's a skill.'

Three other reviewers who have visited the cafe wrote they are 'disappointed with attitude and service' of the staff.

However, the cafe also has 59 excellent reviews and is ranked as the fifth-highest rated restaurant in Keswick out of 102.

Emma has written back to all of the customers who have left her negative reviews to defend her family's approach to business.

In another response to a customer who criticised her cafe, she sarcastically replied that they visited in the month when they specialise in bad service.

She wrote: 'You came in November? ...oh November is the month where we operate a strict mean and surly to everyone policy. We have to balance out the karma you see, what with all that smiling we do in the other months. Sorry cate, thems the rules.'
