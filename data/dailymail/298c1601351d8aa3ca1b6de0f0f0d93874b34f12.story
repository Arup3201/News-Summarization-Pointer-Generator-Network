This is the £3.7 million central London mews house thought to be where a 17-year-old 'sex slave' alleges she had sex with Prince Andrew.

The three-storey home is reportedly owned by G­hislaine Maxwell, a friend of convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, and is believed to be one of the three locations where Virginia Roberts, now 30, claims she was forced to have sex with the royal.

Roberts, now a married mother-of-three, claimed in US civil court documents that she had sex with the Duke of York three times while she was a minor under US law.

She claims she was introduced to the Prince at Maxwell's home in central London in 2001, and claims that she had sex with him there after they returned from a party at private members' club Tamp.  

Roberts is said to have been 'procured' for him by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire American financier, who she accuses of using her as a 'sex slave'.

Maxwell, 53, was also accused in the legal papers, filed in Florida, of acting as a 'madame' and supplying young girls for Epstein and her friends.

The Duke, 54, vehemently denies the allegations against him. Maxwell, the daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell, has also denied the claims. 

It is believed that the house, bought by Maxwell in 1997, is now being rented out. 

Neighbours told the Sunday Mirror they were unaware of anything untoward occurring there, but one said she had seen Andrew and two of his protection officers in the street several years ago.  

'I’ve no idea where he was going. They were walking quickly,' she said.  

A spokesman for Maxwell did not comment on the house.

Roberts, a US citizen, waived her anonymity in an interview with The Mail On Sunday in 2011, in which she claimed she had been sexually exploited by Epstein - a former friend of the Duke.

In the court papers filed last month, she alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince when she was a minor' in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein where an orgy took place. 

Roberts wants to join an existing lawsuit, launched by two other alleged Epstein victims, against federal prosecutors' handling of the financier's case. 

In a strongly-worded statement Buckingham Palace has said: 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.

'The allegations made are false and without any foundation.' 

Others named in the lawsuit have also denied the claims.

Epstein was jailed for 18 months in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution but lawyers for the women claim a secret plea deal he struck with prosecutors granting him, and any potential co-conspirators, immunity from further prosecution violated their clients' rights.  

The Duke's royal engagement is due to take place on January 21, when he is set to appear at the World Economic Forum at Davos, in Switzerland.

It is thought he will speak publicly about the claims, denying the allegations levelled against him.
