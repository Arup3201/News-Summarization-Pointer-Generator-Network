The best footballers on the planet had the chance to earn up to $1million each for playing in an exhibition match at the end of the season, only for the project to be vetoed by their clubs.

The idea was for an annual Europe v Rest of the World game to be staged at the Amsterdam Arena and modelled on basketball’s NBA All-star Game. The plans were advanced enough for there to be confidence last Christmas that the top-secret project would go ahead.

The finances were said to stack up, helped considerably by massive Chinese sponsorship, while TV rights were well advanced.

Chelsea star Diego Costa was another name who super agent Jorge Mendes could have invited to play

Super agent Jorge Mendes was involved, suggesting his stable of Cristiano Ronaldo, Diego Costa, Angel di Maria, Sergio Aguero, James Rodriquez and Radamel Falcao would have been willing participants.

Club managers, such as another Mendes client Jose Mourinho, would not have taken charge of the two sides to avoid conflict. National team bosses would have been hired. There would have been a sliding scale for fees but certainly Ronaldo would have been in the top seven-figure bracket.

However, the major obstacle was the crowded football calendar and the clubs, who would have been paid as well, finally vetoed the all-star game at the January meeting of the European Club Association. 

The clubs had also wanted a bigger share of the proceeds. Robert Bonnier, risk-taking city financier who made and then lost a fortune during the first dotcom bubble, was another well-known name connected with the aborted match.

BT Sport ambassador Jose Mourinho will escape censure from the network after he chose arch rivals Sky’s Goals on Sunday for his 27-minute diatribe on referee Martin Atkinson. 

The grey area of Mourinho’s contract with BT allows him to appear on rival channels — aside from routine managerial commitments — when the club insist. 

Chelsea say Mourinho’s Sky showing was a joint decision made after the 1-1 draw with Burnley. BT are more annoyed with Mourinho’s representatives for letting it happen than Jose himself.

A tweet sent by Swansea’s maverick Dutch director John van Zweden after his club’s victory over Manchester United last weekend is being examined by the FA.

Van Zweden intimated on social media that he bet on the Swans’ win, breaching FA betting regulations — but he has claimed it was not his betting slip posted. The Dutchman, who owns five per cent of Swansea shares, is the subject of a club probe after describing compatriot and Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal as an ‘arrogant b******’ to Dutch media. 

Wallpaper business boss Van Zweden has a chequered past as a convicted football hooligan. The PL are aware of his police record, but it is spent — so he passes the owners and directors test.

Relationships between the Premier League and UEFA, never good at the best of times, have sunk to an all-time low after UEFA’s acceptance of a 2022 Qatar World Cup finishing on December 23. 

This despite arch diplomat David Gill, Premier League representative on the FA, being on the UEFA executive. The Premier League blame president Michel Platini for dominating all UEFA strategy, which includes persuading Gill to reverse his decision not to stand for election as the British vice-president on the FIFA executive.

No wonder the FA have such a low opinion of FIFA when they are provocative enough to include Thailand’s Worawi Makudi as a member of their delegation at the rules-deciding International FA Board summit in Belfast tomorrow.

FIFA executive member Makudi, who is being investigated by the ethics committee for breaches of the World Cup bidding code, probably has the most acrimonious relationship with the FA of any Zurich powerbroker.

After the 2018 World Cup election fiasco, a proposed friendly international between England and Thailand, set up in anticipation of Makudi supporting England’s bid, was called off. And Makudi took legal action against former FA chairman Lord Triesman for alleging, under parliamentary privilege, that Makudi wanted the TV rights to that game. FIFA say Makudi was chosen by the Asian Football Confederation, whose choice it was on a rotational basis.
