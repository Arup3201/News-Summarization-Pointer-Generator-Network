The pilot of a hot air balloon which burst into flames after hitting power lines, killing 11 people on board, had been due to marry his fiancee - and the invitations had been posted on the day he died.

In a sad twist of irony, just days after Lance Hopping was killed in the horrific accident in New Zealand, his family and friends will start to receive invitations to his wedding.

The 50-year-old pilot was due to marry his long-term partner Nina Kelynack in April and the invitations had been posted on the day of his ill-fated flight, it has been reported.

'Hell of a nice guy': Mr Hopping was described as an experienced and safety-conscious pilot

Robert Clyde, Mr Hopping's cousin, told New Zealand's Stuff website: 'The invitations are in the mail now, they were posted yesterday. We were all looking forward to a big reunion.

'Lance rung me a few weeks ago to say to expect an invitation, and that he hoped we could make it for the wedding.'

The pilot's father Robert Hopping said 
the family were in a state of shock, adding: 'We are coping, but we are a
bit of a zombie house at the moment.'

Fellow balloonists praised Mr Hopping, who has two children from a previous marriage and two grandchildren, as an experienced pilot who was safety-conscious and a 'hell of a nice guy'.

He had clocked up more than 1,000 hours flying balloons over 15 years and had flown all over the world.

Witnesses said the hot air balloon 
turned into a horrifying tower of 'sheer flame' after hitting power 
lines in rural New Zealand yesterday, killing all those riding on-board.

Police said five couples and the 
pilot were killed when the hot air balloon crashed near Wellington in an
area that is popular with thrill-seeking tourists.

As authorities continued their investigation into the horrific accident, the identities of some of those killed on board began to emerge.

Retired couple Desmond and Ann Dean, from Masterson, were thought to have received the hot air balloon trip as a Christmas present from their children while Howard and Diana Cox, from Wellington, were also reported to have been among those killed.

Alexis Still, from Wellington, and her boyfriend Chrisjan Jordaan were also thought to have been on board, as were an unnamed mother and daughter.

Two other passengers - a man and a woman who have not been named - jumped to their deaths trying to escape the blazing balloon.

Despite arriving on the scene within three minutes, emergency services were unable to save any of those on board. The balloon was coming to the end of a 45-minute flight and the pilot was thought to be trying to land in a paddock.

Some of the victims' families were 
thought to be on the ground and watched helplessly as their loved ones 
plummeted to their deaths, Stuff reported.

One witness said relatives 'were just
crying' and 'inconsolable' while another revealed that two sisters had 
been following the balloon as their parents rode in it and 'saw it fall 
out of the sky'.

In a particularly heart-rending 
account, one witness told Stuff that they heard a woman in her 30s tell 
someone in a phonecall: 'Mum and dad have been in a hot air balloon 
accident. They've hit powerlines and they're dead.'

Disaster victim identification 
experts have been working through the wreckage in a bid to officially 
identify the victims, some of which are badly burned.

Nine bodies remain at the scene while
two others have been taken to a mortuary at Wellington Hospital the 
Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Local Mayor Ron Mark said those on board were a mix of local people and tourists. Early reports suggested a fire had 
started in the basket, causing the canopy to ignite, resulting in the 
apparatus plunging to the ground in flames, giving no hope for those on 
board.

One witness said that amid screams 
from those in the basket, two of the passengers had jumped out to avoid 
the flames as it plunged.

The pilot and five couples from the 
Wellington area, about 95 miles (150 kilometers) south of the crash 
site, were killed. According to reports, at least one couple received 
their tickets on the balloon trip as a present.Â 

Some of the bodies were badly burned, said Superintendent Mike Rusbatch, a police district commander in Wellington, the capital.

'It's
a tragedy as bad as tragedies get,' local police commander Brent 
Register said. Superintedent Rusbatch said it appeared the balloon's 
basket struck power lines that set a fire on board.

Witnesses
told local media of seeing 32ft (10m) high flames rising from the 
basket of the dark blue and maroon striped balloon before it plummeted 
to the farmland below.

Bevan Lambeth said the basket was on 
fire 'and the power lines were holding the basket down, but it was still
about 50m (165ft) in the air. Then the whole basket started to go up in
flames,' as the balloon broke clear of the electric lines.

'I
saw ... (it) then go straight up in the air and the flames just 
engulfed the whole balloon and it crashed to the ground. When it came 
down it came down really quickly,' he told TVOne News.

An aerial photo of the crash site shows two circles of black ash in a green field, close to a white house.

Rusbatch, the police commander, said two people jumped from the basket before it hit the ground, but did not survive.

'We
believe we know who the victims were,' he told the news website Stuff. 
'... A tragedy for those involved and their families.'

The only victim publicly identified 
so far is the pilot and balloon owner, Lance Hopping. He was safety 
officer for the Balloons over Wairarapa annual event, and was considered
an experienced and safety-conscious pilot.

David McKinlay, who lives near
the crash site near the small town of Carterton witnessed the crash as he was watering his garden. He said it looked as if 
the pilot had tried to take the balloon higher.

'It was just flames and it was just a long streak of flames, probably about 10 meters long. The impact must have been terrible.'

Mr McKinlay said the dark blue and maroon-striped balloon was about 150m in the air and dropped quickly.

'It was just a sheer flame as it hit the ground,' he said. 'It came down like a bloody rocket and there there was a big bang.'

Trout fisherman Kevin Curd saw the 
balloon disappear behind a hill and then, within five seconds 'it was 
blue grey smoke. It shot down but there were no flames then.'

The crash has shocked the small 
farming community on the North Island. Mrs Aurea Hickland watched in 
horror as the balloon came down. 'It was just terrible,' she told the 
New Zealand Herald.

'We were just having breakfast and we have big windows that face out onto where the balloon was coming down.

'I got up to have a cup of tea and I 
looked out the window and saw the balloon coming down. But then it 
started to shoot up in the air. 'I said to my husband "Oh no, the 
basket's on fire, the basket's on fire."

'And it shot up in the air, which I 
guess was because of the heat and we saw two people jump out and 
everyone was screaming - the screaming was just terrible - and then when
the canopy went up flames it just dropped.

'It was going up at a very big rate. I wouldn't like to say how high but it was a very long way up.'

Mrs Hickland said that when she saw two people jump she told her husband Neil: 'They won't survive it.'

She added: 'It was just awful. Neil ran out and then came back with 
two of the family members (who were waiting for the balloon to land) and
one was saying that they had bought the tickets for their parents for 
Christmas. They just kept saying "How are we going to tell our 
children?"'

Conditions were described as perfect 
at the time of the horror incident, which occurred close to 7.30am on 
Saturday, New Zealand time.

Resident Don Cunningham told TVNZ that he heard screaming and shouting and then 'suddenly a big pall of smoke.'

The balloon was a Cameron A-210, which can carry 10 passengers and a pilot.

New Zealand Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee expressed condolences to the bereaved families on behalf of the government.

'We are deeply sorry to learn of this tragic accident and our hearts go out to those who are now mourning the loss of life,' Mr Brownlee said.

New Zealand's Transport Accident Investigation Commission opened an immediate inquiry. Investigating officer Peter Williams said investigators had looked at the crash site but had yet to begin witness interviews. The investigation could take up to a year, he said.

The crash was the deadliest air disaster in New Zealand since 1963, when a DC-3 airliner crashed in the Kaimai Range, killing all 23 passengers and crew aboard, according to the History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage.

In 1979, an Air New Zealand DC-10 airliner on a scenic flight slammed into Mount Erebus in Antarctica, killing all 257 people on board.
