The brother of 12-year-old Moors Murders victim Keith Bennett says he has 'compelling new evidence' and knows where his sibling is buried.

Alan Bennett, 56, claims the evidence has enabled him to narrow down an area the 'size of two football pitches' on Saddleworth Moor, Greater Manchester.

The body of Keith, who was 12 when he was kidnapped and murdered by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley in 1964, has never been found despite numerous searches.

Tragic: Brady's victim Keith Bennett's body has never been found since his murder in 1964

But Mr Bennett, 56, said he'd gathered 'compelling new evidence' after speaking to David Smith, the chief prosecution witness in the pair's murder trial in 1966, and another source who was close to Brady.

He told the Manchester Evening news that photographs of the moor taken by the source 'tied in' with information provided by Smith, who died earlier this year.

Mr Bennett, who runs a website forum dedicated to finding Keith, described the area 'as the width of no more than two football pitches'.

He added: 'Myself and other forum members - of which there are many - are certain than a new official search using this recent evidence could bring Keith home.

'I cannot describe what this would mean to my family.'

Keith mother Winnie, who'd urged Brady to reveal the location of Keith's body, died in August, aged 78.

In September this year Mr Bennett said he was ‘offended and 
angered’ by claims from Members of the Worsley 
Paranormal Group that they 
may have found killer Ian Brady’s spade on Saddleworth Moor.

Members of the group claimed to have found it at a spot where they believe Keith is buried.

But Keith’s brother Alan Bennett said
 on an internet forum dedicated to finding Keith’s remains: 'This is 
complete nonsense as is the Worsley Paranormal Group’s theories and 
activities.

'They are to be found all over the internet chasing anybody who they think will listen to them. They also post videos claiming to have picked up Keith on a 'ghost box' machine, all of which I find totally disgusting.

'They
 know my thoughts on their 'findings' and when they realised, finally, 
that I could not take them seriously, they got very angry to the point 
of being abusive.

'It seems now they, just like the other 'oddballs' in the news lately, have gone to a newspaper. They have seen their moment to jump on the bandwagon with all the recent publicity about the case.

'This
 is just another of several spades that have been found on the moor. It 
is not near any real area of interest to anybody but themselves. I have 
spoken about these people with the police and we all agreed their 
"evidence" was of the sort that did not warrant further consideration - 
to put it mildly.'

He added: 'I am and will continue to be offended and angered by these people.'

It was also claimed earlier this year
 that Brady has passed a letter to his mental health advocate containing
 details of the burial spot.

Brady is said to have told Jackie Powell that the letter was only to be opened after his death.Police launched an investigation and arrested Powell on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of a body.

But the letter has never been found and detectives believe it may have been a ruse by the killer.

Greater Manchester Police renewed their search to find Keith's body in 2003, including scientists, 
clinical psychologists, imagery experts, search advisors, geologists, 
geophysicists, geochemists, archaeologists and anthropologists.

In 2009, it 
concluded there was no longer any specific information to identify new 
search areas and therefore the investigation entered, and remains, in a 
dormant stage.

Martin Bottomley, head of Greater Manchester Police's Cold Case Unit, said: 'As a Force, there is nothing we 
would have liked more than to draw a close to this dark chapter and of 
course we are disappointed we have not located Keith's remains.

'However,
 I would stress that we will never close this case and will always 
remain open to pursuing any new lines of inquiry that may arise from 
significant scientific advances or credible and actionable information.'

'In
 the end, only Ian Brady knows the whereabouts of Keith Bennett's body. 
We have always and will continue to hope that one act of humanity on his
 part will give Keith's family some peace.'

Brady and Hindley were responsible for the murders of five youngsters in the 1960s, sexually torturing their victims before burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor.

They were jailed for life in 1966 for the murders of Leslie Ann Downey, ten, John Kilbride, 12, and Edward Evans, 17. 

They didn't admit to killing Keith and another victim Pauline Reade, 16, until 1987.Hindley died in prison in 2002, aged 60.
