Ross McCormack started the repayments on his £11m transfer fee with the goal that may well have saved Felix Magath’s job as Fulham edged this spicy west London derby.

There were plenty of raised eyebrows when the striker arrived from Leeds United but he gained instant hero status at Griffin Park with a second-half winner.

Trading passes with Chris David, McCormack slotted the ball home left-footed from a tight angle to sink Brentford and settle a highly entertaining Cup tie.

And nobody would have been more relieved that Fulham’s German manager, who was fearing for his future after a dismal start to life back in the second tier.

The Scot was thrilled too. Feeling a weight lifted from his shoulders in opening his account, he booted an advertising board as he celebrated in front of the delirious travelling fans.

These two rivals had not met in a competitive fixture since April 1998 and though Griffin Park was a long way short of capacity, the atmosphere crackled on a soggy west London evening.

Brentford could not have picked a better time to face their foes from five miles down the road. Fulham’s miserable year has not improved with dropping down a division, with four successive defeats from the season’s start leaving them rock bottom of the Championship and manager Felix Magath fighting for his job.

Not that stopped him tinkering with his team. He had already deployed 22 players in those four matches and there were five changes here from the side that capitulated at Derby on Saturday.

Mark Warburton evidently agreed with the need for change in the Cup, making six alterations from the side that drew with Birmingham.

The game started at a frenetic pace, with Brentford’s Jake Bidwell showing intent down the left-hand side to force a couple of early corners and further spark the crowd.

Fulham, though, saw the first clear opening when Tim Hoogland’s 25-yarder fizzed narrowly over David Button’s goal, before £11m man Ross McCormack failed to steer Chris David’s whipped cross on target with his head.

At the other end, Tommy Smith powered a header over from a Jota corner kick before Brentford enjoyed their best opening of the first-half.

A clever training ground free-kick routine saw Jota unleash a fierce angled shot that Marcus Bettinelli knocked away with one fist and brilliant reflexes.

This was a game that simply refused to settle. It was fast and furious, with attack and counter-attack. Another long-range hit from Hoogland skidded into the hands of Button, before Cauley Woodrow criminally blazed over from six yards out after Kay Voser’s cross had found him unmarked.

On the stroke of half-time, the lively Jota wriggled into the box and smashed a low drive against the post with Bettinelli well beaten.

Fulham’s defence was caught napping shortly after the break when Moses Odubajo crept in behind and drilled a dangerous ball across the face of goal.

McCormack stormed through on to Voser’s pass and swept the ball past Button but the joy of his first Fulham goal was cut short by an offside flag.

However, he didn’t have to wait too much longer for his moment as everyone of a Fulham persuasion finally had something to smile about.
