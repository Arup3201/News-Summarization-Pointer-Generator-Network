A high school English teacher will be fired for posting a tweet ridden with profanities and racist slurs about the police shooting of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri - telling her white detractors to kill themselves.

Vinita Hegwood was suspended without pay from Duncanville High School in Texas on Monday morning after it emerged she tweeted on Friday: 'Who the f*** made you dumb duck ass crackers [white people] think I give a squat f*** about your opinions about my opinions RE: #Ferguson? Kill yourselves.'

The outburst prompted a wave of reaction from enraged Twitter users, calling for her suspension.

'Reprehensible': Texan English teacher Vinita Hegwood will be fired for her racist tweet to white followers about the Ferguson police shooting. She has been suspended without pay pending a school board meeting

School district officials met with Hegwood on Monday and have since confirmed her contract will be terminated following a board meeting in the next four weeks. 

'Hegwood expressed an opinion on social media that is solely her own,' the school district explained in a statement. 

'While everyone has the right to free speech, as a teacher in the district, we believe the comments that are alleged to be made by Ms Hegwood are absolutely reprehensible and we do not condone it.' 

Her Twitter account is now closed.

Hegwood, who has worked for the Duncanville Independent School District for two years, has been a prolific tweeter throughout the turmoil in Missouri following the shooting on August 9.

It has been suggested her profane tweet was a reaction to abuse she received from followers, Fox News reported. 

However, officials insists that defense will not protect Hegwood from losing her job.

'I can't say it emphatically enough,' Lari Barager with the Duncanville ISD told CBS, 'the nature of the comments are reprehensible, and this district is about inclusion. It's about diversity. It's about respect for all people.'
