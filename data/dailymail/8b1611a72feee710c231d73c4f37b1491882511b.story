Pilots with regional airline Regional Express are no longer allowed to use visual approaches to airports after one captain mistook a row of giant coal loaders for a runway, an air safety report has revealed.

Crews must use navigational equipment - instead of relying on the human eye - after the incident near Newcastle's Williamtown airport, when Kooragang Island was mistaken for a landing strip, even though it is 19km away from the small terminal.

From a pilots perspective Williamtown airport, left, has similar features to Kooragang Island, right.

A report released on Friday by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said air traffic controllers intervened just in time to direct the Rex plane back to Wiliamtown airport on November 8, 2013. 

The plane’s crew were given clearance to approach Williamtown at about 7.30pm.

Soon after air traffic controllers noticed the descending plane was making a questionable left hand turn after passing Nobbys Head.

The captain is reported to have seen a ‘brightly lit row of buildings’ and believed them to be a part of the airport. 

At this stage the tower controller saw that the plane was ‘manoeuvring at a greater distance than usual from the runway’ and redirected the Sydney to Newcastle flight, not before it had descended to 450 metres off the ground.

Same, same but different: The Kooragang Island industrial area is located 19 kilometers from the airport 

After landing the pilot told authorities the airport was hard to identify as 'lighting conditions were darker than usual' due to 'cloud cover in the western sky.’

Regional Express pilots have since been told not to make a visual approach, instead using navigation equipment to pinpoint their positions.

The report also claims the pilot was effected by an undisclosed illness which left him fatigued.

'The captain later reported that he may not have been fully fit for duty and that, in hindsight, the illness may have affected his performance on the Newcastle Airport flight.'
