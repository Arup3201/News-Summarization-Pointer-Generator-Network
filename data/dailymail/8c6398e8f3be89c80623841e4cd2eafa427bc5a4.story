Whisky blasted into space three years ago is set to return to Earth next month.

The experiment could reveal how gravity affects how alcohol matures and tastes in space.

The Ardbeg Distillery on the Scottish island of Islay, sent compounds of unmatured malt to the International Space Station (ISS) in an unmanned cargo spacecraft in October 2011, along with particles of charred oak.

Scientists hope to understand how they interact at close-to-zero gravity.

The vial of specially-designed whisky has been orbiting the Earth's atmosphere at 17,227mph, 15 times a day for 1,045 days.

During which time, an identical bottle has sat untouched at the distillery to act as a control sample.

The single malt is expected to land back on solid ground in Kazakhstan aboard a rocket on September 12.

The two samples will then be reunited at a laboratory in Houston, Texas, where scientists will compare them to examine the interaction of the molecules with charred oak, to see what differences occur between Earth whisky and space whisky.

‘Ardbeg is known for taking risks in its development of some of the most coveted whiskies in the world, so it is fitting that it is the first distillery ever in space, said Dr Bill Lumsden, Ardbeg's director of distilling and whisky creation.

‘We are now close to the end, close to finding answers to something previously unknown which is truly exciting.

‘This is one small step for man but one giant leap for whisky, and the team hope to uncover how flavours develop in different gravitational conditions - findings which could revolutionise the whisky-making process.

‘We hope to shine new light on the effect of gravity on the maturation process but who knows where it will lead us? It could be to infinity and beyond.’

Astronauts and cosmonauts have consumed alcohol in space from Buzz Aldrin’s famous ‘communion on the moon’ to blurry footage of Russian cosmonauts knocking back some cognac on Mir.

Before Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin boarded the lunar module on July 20 1969, Aldrin unstowed a small piece of bread and a tiny container of wine from Webster Presbyterian church near Houston and took communion, which was hushed up at the time.

He reportedly remarked that the liquid swirled and ran up the side of the small chalice.

Mir cosmonaut Alexander Lazuthin told NBC that cognac was provided among the medical kit and was prescribed to cosmonauts ‘to stimulate our immune system and on the whole keep our organisms in tone.’

In the early 1970s, Nasa, together with experts from the University of California, Davis, sought to develop wine that could be consumed on the US’s first space station, SkyLab.

Having tested numerous ideas, they settled upon sherry as the perfect spacey alcoholic beverage because if its stability and strong taste.

Barley has been grown on the ISS and used to produce limited edition ‘space beer’ which was sold in Japan for around $19 a bottle and a lavish PR stunt saw one vodka manufacturer board a vomit comet to mix a cocktail by spinning his whole body around to shake the drink up.

The two samples will then be reunited at a laboratory in Houston, Texas, where scientists will compare them to examine the interaction of the molecules with charred oak, to see what differences occur between Earth whisky and space whisky. Dr Bill Lumsden is pictured
