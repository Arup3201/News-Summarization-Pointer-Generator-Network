The Dow Jones today closed up almost 500 points in an astonishing rally after the world’s major central banks announced a desperate move to kick-start the global financial system.

The operation, led by the U.S. 
Federal Reserve, came amid fears that at least one major European bank 
may be teetering on the brink of collapse.

The dramatic move to shore up the world's creaking economy was undermined after the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded its 
ratings on 15 global banks by one notch.

The central banks of Europe, the U.S.
and others agreed to give banks cheaper access to loans in U.S. 
dollars, which aims to avert a credit crisis like the one after Lehman 
Brothers collapsed in 2008.

The
Dow jumped 490 points in its biggest gain since March 2009 - rising 4.2
per cent to close at 12,045. The S&P was up 52 points to 1,245; and
the Nasdaq jumped 105 points to 2,620.

This move, akin to interest rate cuts, gives credit markets extra liquidity by effectively providing banks with unlimited U.S. dollars to fund themselves.

'Cutting swap costs is the equivalent of interest rate cuts. The banks will be hoping this is a turning point in the crisis,' economist Jeremy Cook said.

But last night John Higgins, 
of the Capital Economics research consultancy, 
said the central banks’ intervention would provide temporary relief for 
Europe, but warned that it was ‘not a game changer’. He added: ‘Welcome 
as the news was, we do not think it signals a turning point in the 
crisis.’

In a bleak assessment of the crisis engulfing Europe, a UK government spokesman said: ‘We are experiencing a credit crunch.’

The surprise plan was aimed at preventing global financial markets from coming under pressure that could potentially lead to a seizing up of credit.

For November, the Dow edged up 0.76 per 
cent, but the S&P fell 0.50 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite 
dropped 2.39 per cent overall.

The Federal Reserve has joined with other central banks to kick-start the global economy.

They want to make it easier for banks to get dollars when needed and avert a credit crunch.

Non-U.S. banks need dollars to fund American operations and make dollar loans to firms.

But banks are afraid to lend because nobody is sure who holds bad government debt.

If a European government defaults then it will probably put the U.S. back into recession, so it is in everyone's interests to avoid this.

The central banks will reduce the cost of temporary dollar loans offered to banks - called liquidity swaps - to a half percentage point.

The Fed noted banks were not having difficulty now getting funds in short-term markets - but it still has a ‘range of tools’ for use as a backstop.

Britain’s FTSE closed up 3.2 per cent to 5,505, the DAX in Germany was up 5 per cent to 6,089 and France’s CAC was up 4.2 per cent to 3,155.

Traders said the move recalled the co-ordinated action to steady global markets that was taken during the 2008 financial crisis.

Economist Mark Cliffe said policymakers are ‘beginning to address the problem’. He stated there was a ‘very dark mood’ developing last week.

Mr Cliffe added that policymakers must step in with ‘aggressive measures’ and begin to ‘confront the financing problems of the sovereigns’.

Other economists welcomed the move but warned that a lot of work remains to deal with the underlying sovereign debt crisis.

'Doing more on the collateral side is probably the second step. The ECB is helping the banking system while sovereigns do their homework,' he said.

The shock agreement came as European Union finance ministers met in Brussels to discuss radical plans to address the debt crisis.

It could see member states handing over control of their finances. Leaders have been warned they have 10 days to complete a crisis response.

Euro zone ministers agreed detailed 
plans to leverage the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSF), but
warned they may have to turn to the IMF for more help to avert 
financial disaster.

Olli Rehn, Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner, said: 'We are now entering the critical period of 10 days to complete and conclude the crisis response of the European Union.'

Italian and Spanish bond yields resumed 
their inexorable climb towards unsustainable levels on today, as markets
assessed the rescue fund boost as inadequate.

It comes as stock markets rose after buoyant consumer confidence figures renewed optimism in the strength of the U.S. economy.

Europe's ongoing battle to contain its debt crisis will remain a key driver in markets for a while to come, especially if countries continue having to pay elevated interest rates to get investors to lend to them.

Italy was yesterday forced to pay a high interest rate on an auction of three-year debt. The 7.89 per cent rate was nearly three percentage points higher than last month.

If Italy was to default on its debt of 1.9 trillion euros, the fallout would damage the euro and send shock waves throughout the global economy.
