Â A 16 stone woman shed half her body weight after a male masseur asked her if she was pregnant while on holiday.

Jodie Driver, 23, had always been overweight and was known as 'the bubbly and cuddly one' by her friends at school.

But one embarrassing summer holiday in Turkey made her determined to shed the excess pounds.

In June 2009, Jodie joined her mother Jo, 45 and friend on holiday to Bodrum.

On the first day of the holiday the girls decided to treat themselves to a traditional Turkish bath and massage at their hotel.

Jodie, at 5ft 2in and a dress size 22, was a little anxious about having to strip down to her underwear, but was left red faced and humiliated after the masseur ridiculed her over her size.

'The masseur told me to take my clothes off so I stripped down to my underwear,' she said.

'The first thing he did was point to my stomach and said "baby?". I was gob smacked, and told him "no, definitely not".

'He then said again "baby?" while making belly shapes with his hands on his own stomach. "I was horrified."

Determined effort: Jodie during her 5k charity run in June 2010. She had slimmed down from a size 22 to a size 16 by this point. Today she is a super-fit size 8

Then the masseur started to tease 
Jodie telling her that she should not have a protruding belly, and while
pinching and wobbling her fat throughout the massage told her that it 
was unnatural.

'He said to me "What's this? This shouldn't be here."

'During
the whole massage he was talking and joking to his mates in Turkish and
they were all laughing at me, it was really demoralising.'

Jodie spent the remainder of the 
holiday covered up, too self conscious to wear anything 
remotely revealing in risk of further ridicule.

Then one night back at home in Oxford, Jodie looked back through her holiday pictures with disgust.

'I looked at myself in the photographs and said, "I have to change".

'I saw myself smiling, but I didn't look happy, there was a sadness around me.'

The next day Jodie joined a gym and decided to give herself a target to motivate her weight-loss.

She set a date to run the Race for Life in June 2010 and began going to the gym three times a week, ditching her junk food diet to get into shape.

At first Jodie, who works as a personnel officer at Oxford University could barely run 30 seconds, let alone 5k, and was embarrassed at how loud her running was on the treadmill.

But when she swapped the greasy takeaways and ready meals for chicken and vegetables, she soon increased her energy levels and was able to run over an hour in the gym.

Within six months she had already lost an impressive four stone.

Her old diet consisted of toast with 
big dollops of Nutella layered on top for breakfast, a chocolate bar and
hot chocolate for a mid-morning snack, a big baguette with crisps and a
fizzy drink for lunch.

In the afternoon, she tucked into biscuits, while dinner was a takeaway or 
ready meal with chips for dinner, as well as the occasional whole pot of
Ben and Jerry's ice cream.

But
now Jodie eats a diet of oats with water and a scoop of whey protein 
for breakfast, Greek yoghurt, white fish with vegetables and chicken 
with spinach and sweet potatoes.

In
June 2010, on her 21st birthday, she completed the Race for Life in 
just 35 minutes and immediately gave herself another goal - a half 
marathon the following year in April 2011- which she also completed in 1
hour and 53 minutes.

Now Jodie is a svelte size 8 and super fit.

Jodie in 2007 when she was a size 18 to 20. She said she had always been known as the 'cuddly one'

She said: 'I now train six days a week, doing around one hour 
cardiovascular exercise plus weight training which targets specific 
muscle groups. It takes an awful lot of self-discipline.

'However,
as I have lost such a large amount of weight I have a small amount of 
spare skin on my lower abdomen which will need to be removed through 
surgery before I can compete.'

Joining
the gym also helped Jodie find love with fellow fitness fanatic, 
bodybuilder partner Tom Baker, 26, who works in car production.

'Tom, is a huge source of motivation for me.

'I knew him from when I was a bit younger and he was a close friend of my brothers, but I hid away from him back then.

'We came to know each other more during 2011 and would always talk about the gym and fitness as it was a shared interest.

'We got together officially in January 2012 and it has been the happiest year of my life so far. We train together quite often and we have a very similar diet as he is also a body builder.'

Looking back at who she was just a few years ago Jodie said: 'If some would have said I'd look like this back then, I would have said 'no chance'.

'Looking back, I ironically have a lot to thank that Turkish masseur, as he inspired me to change my life. He did me the biggest favour.'

Now Jodie hopes to compete in the UK Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation's bikini category later on this year.
