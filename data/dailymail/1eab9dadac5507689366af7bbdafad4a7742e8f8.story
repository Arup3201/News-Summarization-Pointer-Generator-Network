When the victim turned around and confronted the thief, the suspect called him a 'dirty f***ing Jew,' spit on him, then bashed him in the head with an umbrella, according to the New York Post. 

When the victim tried to chase after his assailant, a second suspect attacked him from behind, kicking him in the back of the legs and lower back and knocking him down. 

A third attacker piled on and also screamed anti-Semitic slurs at the man.
