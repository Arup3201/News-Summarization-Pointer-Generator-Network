McLaren’s much-heralded new partnership with Honda was ‘launched’ with all the gusto of a flat balloon – a 75-second video smuggled out on its website at noon on Thursday. 

It was accompanied by brave talk of ‘a new era’ and ‘making history’, but for a team famed for staging some of the most lavish launches in even Formula One’s decadent world, this online offering was shamefully tame.

The video flashed from the old McLaren-Honda to the 2015 model, the MP4-30. The new car had a red streak up the sides and red wing mirrors, harking back to the chariots that took Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost to their title victories more than 20 years ago.

Button was retained  at the end of 2014 while Alonso ended his stay with Ferrari to re-join McLaren 

But it was a farcical ‘launch’ by the standards of McLaren, who previously employed the Spice Girls and Cirque du Soleil to accompany the unveiling of their cars. Even the timing of the ‘launch’ was kept secret. And their drivers, Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, were absent from the ‘launch’ video.

McLaren-Honda are hoping to recreate their glory period of the late Eighties and early Nineties, when they won four drivers’ and four constructors’ championship and 44 races from 80 starts. To do so, Honda will have to make a better job of matching Mercedes’ engine than this launch did of representing a first-rank team.

We will get the first indications of McLaren-Honda’s strength when testing starts in Jerez, Spain, on Sunday.

The team merely issued a press release containing quotes from management and the drivers.

'The off-season has really brought about a sense of renewal coming into 2015 – continuing my relationship with McLaren, getting married, and now embarking on such an exciting chapter: McLaren’s new partnership with Honda,' said Button. 

'I’ve trained hard over the winter, and I’m absolutely itching to get going in the new McLaren-Honda MP4-30.

'It’s been interesting to spend time in the factory during the past few weeks: you can really sense a feeling of reignited optimism and positivity around the building. I’ve never seen such motivation amongst the guys – we’re all massively keen to get going in Jerez and to work hard on developing our new car.

'But we’re under no illusion that it will be easy – there’s a huge challenge ahead of us to try to pull back the gap to our rivals, but we’re certainly up for it. We ended last season with great momentum and clear progress, and I’m determined to carry that forward into 2015.

'I’m also looking forward to working with my new team-mate, Fernando [Alonso], and I’m confident that our joint experience on track will pay dividends in our development race to get our team back to the front of the grid. I’m hugely motivated to make more history in this new McLaren-Honda era.' 

Alonso, who re-joins the team he left so acrimoniously in 2007, added: 'Although the winter period is a time for rest and relaxation from racing, my motivation could not be stronger for the new season. 

'I’ve done a lot of training during the winter break, to reach my peak physical fitness, and I’ve been working hard in preparation for this new era of McLaren-Honda. I’ve never felt better, or more ready for a new season.

'Of course, we’re prepared for a steep learning curve, but it’s clear to see that inside McLaren-Honda there’s total commitment, and a real change in feeling, as we start this new partnership.

'Our first target will be to learn the maximum from the car at the pre-season tests, understand the package, and extract as much performance as possible. That won’t be easy or trouble-free, but we’re ready for that. Why? Because our key focus will be on development. 

'Historically, McLaren has already been characterised by its ability to bring updates to the car quickly, and develop a strong package.

'It’s going to be a real privilege to be the first person to drive the new McLaren-Honda MP4-30 at Jerez, and I can’t wait to begin what I’m certain will be a very exciting new chapter in my career. I’m as motivated now as I was when I was given my first opportunity at the wheel of an F1 car.

'Last but not least, I’m excited to be sitting alongside Jenson, a great team-mate and a very experienced competitor. Together we’ll push the team forward, to learn, to progress, and eventually to achieve the best possible results together. We are ready for the new era.'
