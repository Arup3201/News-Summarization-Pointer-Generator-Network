Now this really is how to sweet talk your way into a job.

Designer Matthew Hirsch came up with the idea of wrapping his CV around a chocolate bar after noticing the similarity between his name and that of famous confectionery brand Hershey's.

Armed with dozens of Hershey's bars, Mr Hirsch, from Grand Rapids in Michigan, then began recreating the iconic bar's wrapper after being given an assignment to create promotional material for himself while attending a summer class.

Mr Hirsch has found a creative way to show off his skills and qualifications

Some of the components he changed include an established date to match his date of birth, the nutritional information to rank his skills and the barcode became his phone number.

Mr Hirsch said the response he has received has been overwhelming after images of the bar were spread across the internet.

Mr Hirsch, who already has a full-time job, said: 'When I was young my nickname was Hirschy, a play on my name in relation to the Hershey's line of products that everyone knows and loves.

'After I was given the class assignment, I scrambled for a few weeks to come up with something interesting - and that's when I remembered the idea I had from years ago about the Hirschy's bar.

'I started by buying dozens of Hershey bars to study the layout and then I recreated the same basic components and changed them to fit me.

'On the front people can see my weight and the year I was born; on the back I wanted to showcase skills and contact info, which I managed to tuck into the barcode.

'The response to the idea has been overwhelming - I'm quite honoured and very grateful to those who appreciate it.'
