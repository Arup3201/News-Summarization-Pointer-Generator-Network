East London will stop for a moment on Wednesday night. As Lionel Messi clambers off the Argentina coach on Green Street, hundreds will gather to catch a glimpse.

Half of the world’s big two is in town for one week only. It’s not to be missed.

Messi has already captured the imagination around West Ham’s Rush Green Academy base – particularly after playing a practice match against the club’s Under 21 side – and is set to dazzle under the East End lights.

There are question marks over whether Atletico Madrid striker Mario Mandzukic will feature for Niko Kovac's side 

Luka Modric (playing against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday) is likely to start on the bench for the Croats in east London

That fleeting game was described as an ‘unreal experience’ by youngster Sam Westley as fever engulfs this pocket of the capital. Messi has sprinkled a little bit of magic already.

But that will hit new highs when Argentina take on Croatia at Upton Park.

Only Cristiano Ronaldo – with the added gravitas and swagger – is bigger business than Messi. For many, the little forward is their hero and any opportunity to see him in the flesh - in their own backyard - has to be taken.

Although West Ham are only hosting a friendly, one which should be relatively one-sided, you only had to be down at Rush Green on Tuesday to fully realise what this means. Diafra Sakho might be banging in goals this season and on his way to becoming a new icon, but it is not often a three-time Ballon d’Or rocks up ready to play ball.

The Barcelona star will play wide for Gerardo Martino’s team against depleted opposition. Add to that suggestions of Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero also playing, and there could be goals aplenty.

There is also the added subplot in Tevez’s return to a place he is adorned for the first time since November 2012 on a night when he will end a three-year absence from international football.

Only he won’t be a rival on this occasion, but a striker to celebrate and applaud. Javier Mascherano too, although his stock isn’t quite so high with Hammers.

While Niko Kovac’s Croatia are without a number of star names, likely to rest Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic while striker Mario Mandzukic may be on the bench.

Modric would actually rather be out there amongst it.

‘Of course I’d love to play against Argentina,’ he said. ‘I’d be wonderful, but the match against Italy is much more important and we’re going to prepare well for Sunday.

‘I think the game against Argentina will be a good one. I think they’re scary and play really well, but we’re going to work hard to get a good result. I hope we can put up a good fight.’

But it does hand an opportunity to an 18-year-old who – if he continues a startling rise – seems primed to carry the hopes of a nation for the next decade and more.

Alen Halilovic is the name and will definitely feature against Argentina. The midfielder has only turned out for Barcelona B in his short career so far but is drawing huge praise. Barca thought enough of him to hand the teenager a five-year contract after an encouraging spell in the first team at Dinamo Zagreb.

There has been Premier League interest, but you fancy the Catalans want to keep him close.

‘Obviously he has great potential and there is a great career ahead of him,’ Kovac said. ‘He has the quality and has spoken with his Barcelona team-mates regarding Wednesday's match. I'm sure they are all looking forward to it.’

Watching Messi strut his stuff and having a look at a star in the making - Angel di Maria hasn't even got a mention. And they said international friendlies had lost all meaning.
