Last time she made an appearance in public, a gust of wind blew up her dress.

So this time, the Duchess of Cambridge decided on a more demure appearance as she arrived at a charity ball in Central London.

After her husband's scene-stealing appearance with Jon Bon Jovi and Taylor Swift earlier this week, she needed to make a headline-grabbing appearance of her own, and with an elegant off-the-peg Temperley dress accompanied by a pair of glamorous Jimmy Choos, she did just that.

Kate, 31, who had left her 
four-month-old son Prince George at home with daddy at Kensington 
Palace, was out and about in her role as patron of the charity, which 
provides financial support for promising young athletes.

Crowds gathered outside Embankment Gardens in Central London to watch the glamorous Duchess alight from her official car at 7pm and walk the red carpet into Supernova, a pop-up Christmas entertainment venue.

The Duchess walked down the red carpert in the laser-cut design cocktail dress wearing black suede five-inch Cosmic pumps costing £450.

The Duchess also appeared to have had her hair darkened and trimmed in preparation for the event.

Earlier this month her locks were much discussed when she appeared at a poppy day event displaying obvious grey roots.

Tonight, however, her hugely envied hair was glossy and dark. She also appeared to have had an inch or so cut from the length.

The Duchess was greeted by a group of promising athletes at the door before settling down for a three-course meal

She was greeted by three of 
SportsAids brightest young talents as well as Olympians Amy Williams, 
Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson and Anna Watkins.

On
 arrival at the ball she swapped notes with another new mother, Olympic 
gold-medallist rower Anna Watkins who had her two-month-old son on 
September 20.

Anna said: 'I've met Kate before during the Olympics, she's lovely and so interested and supportive of athletes.

'She asked me what I've been up to since the Olympics and I said "well actually I've had a baby."

'I had a son, William, two months ago.

The patron of Sports Aid chatted to other guests before she made her way into the venue

'Kate
 said congratulations and said "will you go back to rowing?" I told her I
 have no current plans to, but am not ruling it out. Life has changed.'

After dinner Kate presented the coveted One-to-Watch Award for the most impressive up-and-coming young athlete.

From a shortlist of three, the duchess gave the prize to 16-year-old shooter Amber Hill from Bracknell.

Opening
 the gold envelope, Kate said: 'I'm pleased to announce that the winner 
of the SportsAid One-to-Watch Award 2013 is Amber Hill.'

In an interview before the prize presentation, compere John Inverdale said to Amber: 'Shooting, it's not the sexiest sport in the world.'

She joked: 'I'm sure I can make it.' After being presented with her award, Amber said: 'It was totally unexpected, I really couldn't believe it.

'Kate said she loved my comments (about making her sport sexy). She congratulated me how amazingly I have done.

'It's no nice that she recognises young up-and-coming athletes.

The
 Duchess's dress incorporated the best of traditional and modern - a 
traditional cocktail design with a cut-out pattern which revealed a nude
 underlay.

She was also sporting vertiginous black suede heels and a clutch bag.

Inside
 guests dined on decidedly un-sporting fodder including chicken and 
cranberry wellington, slow-cooked shoulder of lamb, balsamic onions and 
cumin vegetables, followed by a decadent chocolate crumb desert with 
coco meringues.

The Sportsball gala dinner is Sportsaid's major annual fundraiser.

It also celebrates the achievements of the athletes the charity has supported over the years and looks to the future by shining a light on talent in the next generation.

With this in mind, the Duchess will  present the One-to-Watch Award, which honours a young British sportsman or woman who has demonstrated extraordinary commitment to their sport and career and previous recipients include diver Tom Daley.

Chosen from more than 1,300 athletes who have been supported by SportsAid this year, the three shortlisted nominees for this year’s One-to-Watch Award are 16-year-old shooter Amber Hill, 17-year-old pole vaulter Harry Coppell and 18-year-old rower Jess Leyden.

Dozens of Olympic and Paralympic legends, many of whom were helped by SportsAid early in their careers, attended the gala night as well as supporters including tycoon's son Sam Branson and his wife, Isabella, half sister of Prince Harry's girlfriend, Cressida Bonas.

The evening will culminatine in a live auction of unique sporting experiences and memorabilia including a box for ten at Royal Ascot and a signed photograph of Wimbledon Champion Andy Murray.
