Adam Gemili insists England can challenge the might of Jamaica in the 4x100metres at the Commonwealth Games - despite Usain Bolt declaring he is 'available for relay duty'.

The world and Olympic champion will not be eligible for selection in the 100m or 200m in Glasgow because he will miss this weekend's Jamaican Championships after suffering a foot injury earlier this year, but has announced he is 'available' to take part in the relay, if required.

Bolt ran a blistering 8.70-second last leg as Jamaica won Olympic gold in the 4x100m at London 2012, but Gemili believes England now have the talent to be competitive against the world's best.

Boost: Adam Gemili won his 200m heat at the Sainsbury's British Championships on Friday night

Speaking after winning his 200m heat at the Sainsbury's British Championships in 20.71secs on Friday night, Gemili said: 'You know how talented he (Bolt) is. It's going to be tough, but I think if we get the baton round we've got the speed in the team to hopefully get ourselves up there with them.

'It's cool (Bolt could compete at the Commonwealths). He brings something to every event he does. He always lifts the atmosphere of the crowd and everyone gets very excited so it's all good.'

Delano Williams, the Turks and Caicos sprinter who trains with Bolt in Kingston and declared his allegiance to Great Britain last year, finished second behind Gemili in 20.90secs and then revealed Jamaicans Yohan Blake and Warren Weir had been asking about the 20-year-old's progress.

Williams added: 'I guess that means British sprinting is on the world stage now and they recognise us.

'It's great that Bolt will run in Glasgow, but I really want Adam to win and show Britain can do it.'

Confident: Margaret Adeoye sailed through her heat in the 200m in Birmingham on Friday

Danny Talbot, Chris Clarke and James Ellington also progressed to Saturday's 200m final, while the main contenders in the women's event all sailed through their heats, too. 

The clock showed Margaret Adeoye had run a huge personal best of 22.58secs to win the opening race - a time which would have put her equal third on the British all-time list - but her confirmed result was actually 23.26secs. 

Bianca Williams won the second heat in exactly the same time, while Jodie Williams and Anika Onuora both progressed with 23.62secs and 23.42secs respectively.

Adeoye said: 'I was happy until they changed the time - I thought I had run a personal best. 

'But I felt good - it's still a strange feeling as I've been training for 400m. I'm here to win – only the gun and the clock can beat you.'

Tom Burton, Niall Flannery, Rhys Williams and Richard Yates won their 400m hurdle heats in the absence of former world champion Dai Greene, who has delayed the start of his season after three hernia operations.
