Britain is bathing in glorious sunshine today as a heatwave sweeps the country - with supermarkets stocking up for a bumper weekend.

The hot weather and World Cup action means supermarket bosses are predicting a surge in sales of burgers, sausages, ice cream and alcohol.

With temperatures as high as 27C (80.6F), today is set to be the hottest day of the year so far - beating the likes of many of the World Cup's host cities, including Rio de Janeiro, which will remain in the mid-twenties.

It is a far cry from yesterday when a heatwave swept across the country and sunbathers basked in record temperatures of 27C on Brighton beach

It will even beat the weather seen by fans and players at 
the football tournmaent in Brazil - with the country's
opening match against Croatia played in the relative cool of the low 20s in Sao
 Paulo.

If temperatures reach 27C, they will surpass this year's current record of 26.5C, which was recorded in Writtle, near Chelmsford in Essex, on Monday.

However, forecasters are warning sun-seekers to make the most of today's weather as temperatures are expected to dip on Saturday, with the possibility of thundery showers.

But despite this, it will still be a 'nice weekend' with bouts of sunshine typical for this time of year, MeteoGroup forecaster George Goodfellow said.

Eating lunch: People eat their lunch in the sunshine in Canarf Wharf, London. By this evening we may see some thunderstorms and showers, according to MeteoGroup

'By this evening we're likely to see 
some thunderstorms and showers, and over the weekend there will be a 
noticeable drop in temperature,' he said.

'It will drop to what we are used to seeing in June, around 21 or 22C, so it should still be a nice weekend.'

But the predicted drop in temperatures has not deterred supermarket bosses, who are expecting to see record sales of BBQ food and alcohol over the weekend.

 Tesco is expecting to see a surge in sales of BBQ food and alcohol this weekend, including:

Tesco beer 
category spokesman Natasha Pitman told MailOnline: 'Fantastic weather and the 
world’s biggest sporting event will help create a real carnival 
atmosphere across Britain starting this weekend.

'The mere 
mention of a sunny weekend from weather forecasters is enough to change 
shopping plans and judging by early sales we believe many people will be
 enjoying al fresco dining this weekend.

'But of course on 
Saturday night there’s also the greatly anticipated England versus Italy game
 so we are preparing for what could be

'We’ve brought in extra supplies to our depots to make sure stores can be stocked up for customers at the drop of a hat.'

She
 added that Tesco expects to see its sales of Pimms soar by a 
staggering 200 per cent, steaks by 140 per cent, instant BBQs by 150 per
 cent, sausages by 15 per cent and bottles of beer by 35 per cent.

Meanwhile, Sainsbury's is expecting to sell two million burgers – that is 200 burgers for each England fan travelling to Brazil - as well as 10million sausage rolls, six million bread rolls, 18million strawberries and increased sales of beers and ciders. 

Asda and M&S have also reported predicted surges in sales, with the former likely to sell a staggering three million litres of beer over the course of the World Cup - enough to fill the London Olympic swimming pool.

But Simon Partridge from the Met 
Office explained that today's long spells of humidity could lead to a build up of 
cloud and higher chances of downpours over the weekend.

Punting: Today's weather is even better than that experienced by fans and players at the World Cup in Brazil - with the country's opening match against Croatia played in the relative cool of the low 20s in Sao Paulo. Above, sun-seekers punt on the River Cam in Cambridge today

'We

 do have a weak front system bringing a lot of cloud with it,' he said. 
'That cloud will thicken through the morning into the late afternoon and
 early evening, bringing the chance of rain.'

It
 is expected to remain cloudy in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which 
have missed out on the sunny spell that the rest of the UK is enjoying.

The
 weather is set to pick up again from Sunday, but may struggle to reach 
the high temperatures experienced this week, Mr Partridge added.

England's
 footballers, who will take to the pitch in Manaus in north west Brazil 
on Saturday evening, will have to contend with temperatures of between 
23C and 29C.
