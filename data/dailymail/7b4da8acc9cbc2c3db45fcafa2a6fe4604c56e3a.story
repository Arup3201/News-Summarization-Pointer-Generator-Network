This is the moment one of Australia's deadliest creatures found itself at the mercy of yet another of the nation's venomous killers.

A Victorian farmer was astonished to find an enormous red-back spider had lifted an eastern brown snake off the ground and 'hurled it' into its web under one of the family's car at the weekend. 

'It's just mindboggling,' said Neale Postlethwaite, a farmer of 20 years from Gooroc, north of Melbourne. 

'I can't believe it was actually able to stop it and then hurl it up backwards into its nest.'

A Victorian farmer found this astonishing scene at the weekend, where a large red-back spider had managed to lift this baby eastern brown snake off the ground with its web and draw it up into its nest

Suspended above the ground, this eastern brown snake was caught in the spider web of a large red-back spider and lifted upwards. The snake was found dead overnight

Mr Postlethwaite found the baby snake suspended off the ground on Saturday evening, the large spider sitting on top. 

To his surprise, the snake was still alive at the time, with the farmer daring to place his finger nearby.

'I thought the snake was dead and went to put my finger there and the snake was still alive at the time,' Mr Postlethwaite said.  

The eastern brown snake is known for its potent venom, which can cause sudden death, neurotoxity, coagulation disturbances and nephrotoxicity, according to researchers. 

Mr Postlethwaite filmed video of the snake lolling around in its final hours

Eastern brown snakes - such as the one pictures - contain enough venom to kill 20 adults with a single bite

Australia is home to 20 out of the world's 25 most venomous snakes, including the eastern brown, which is found along the populous east coast

Redback spiders are found throughout the country and there more than 250 red-back bites each year which require the use of anti-venom, according to the Australian Museum

But this baby snake was presumably a victim of the spider's poison. 

The snake died overnight, with Mr Postlethwaite finding its corpse being devoured by ants in the dust the next day. 

Mr Postlethwaite told Daily Mail Australia his family often found redbacks on their property. 

This particular creature had been living under his wife's car. She is a little reticent about getting back behind the wheel, the farmer said. 

'My wife doesn't want to drive her car until she can get an underbody car wash,' he joked.
