It's the awkward situation that no convicted fraudster wants to be in.

But the infamous Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort is no stranger to confrontation, especially when it comes to the Australian media.

This time, thanks to Triple M's Grill Team, the former stockbroker went head to head with a disgruntled Californian investor on Friday morning.

Jordan Belfort was attacked during another Australian interview, this time on Triple M's Grill Team based in Sydney on Friday morning

This followed the accusations Minor made during a previous interview which was put straight to Belfort.

'He's a liar and a cheat and he's preyed on not just the rich, he's also preyed on the poor people and the middle class,' the investor said yesterday.

Minor went on to say that he invested $80,000 but is still owed about $50,000.

'If you are here to do a hatchet job on me I have a lot of interviews to do,' Belfort responded as he tried to move on from the accusations.

But much to his surprise, real estate appraiser Ken Minor was waiting on the other line during the interview with Sydney-based radio show.

The former stockbroker was recently brought to life on the big screen as Leonardo DiCaprio portrayed him in The Wolf Of Wall Street

'Where is my money?' Minor demanded - a question he's been waiting to ask Belfort for years.

'I'm not here to engage in sensationalism, Ken,' he said. 'Call my office, we'll have a private conversation any time you'd like.'

But the interview conveniently wrapped up when Ken said: 'I can't get anybody to call me back with anybody that knows anything about sending me any money'.

In an interview to be aired on 2Day FM on Monday morning, Belfort claims he is paying back his victims and aims to pay back everyone this year using 100 per cent of his US profits.

'I'll set the record straight here, this is a big question, and I'll give you the most succinct answer I possibly can,' he told the station's hosts.

'I paid back a lot of money, I always have. Even when I first got out of jail I was paying back 50 per cent of my income for the first few years that I was on probation – that was my deal with the government.

'Once that deal was over, they had a judgement against me and I tried, I tried actively tried to turn over 100 per cent of the books... and the movie, and the government literally fought me tooth and nail every step of the way, it did not want to hear from me.

Belfort said with a US tour announced this year, he is paying back 100 per cent of the profits.

'Everything I make in the US this year, it should be around 50 million bucks, and I'm paying off everybody in one shot, that’s my goal for this year,' he said.

He added he was sorry about what he did but was focused on rectifying the situation.

'It's more about what you do about it - talk is cheap, bottom line,' he said.

Last week MailOnline reported that the former stockbroker said he was attacked in a 60 Minutes interview and described journalist Liz Hayes as a 'f-wit'

Belfort raked in a known $200million from his Long Island-based brokerage, Stratton Oakmont, during the late 1980s and 90s.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission shut down Belfort's firm in 1998 and he was then convicted and sentenced to four years in jail in 2003 for defrauding investors.

As part of his sentence, 'the Wolf' was ordered to pay $110.4 million in restitution to his 1513 ­victims.

He spent 22 months in prison and has paid back $11.6 million to date.
