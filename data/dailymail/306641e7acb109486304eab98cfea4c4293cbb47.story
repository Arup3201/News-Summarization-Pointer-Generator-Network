UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says he is jealous of Gangnam Style artist Psy, because he has stolen his crown as the world’s most famous South Korean.

The UN chief joked during a meeting with Psy that he felt overshadowed by the star, whose video has scored over 500 million views on YouTube.

The fellow countrymen then joined together in re-creating the world-wide phenomenon that is the Gangnam-style dance.

‘I'm a bit jealous. Until two days ago
 someone told me I am the most famous Korean in the world. Now I have to
 relinquish. I have no regrets,’ Ban said.

The two lavished praise on each other 
at UN headquarters Tuesday, with Ban even risking a few of Psy's 
trademark dance moves from the viral smash video Gangnam Style.

‘So now you have first and second 
famous Korean in the same building,’ Psy told reporters at a photo 
opportunity with the UN chief.

Psy, whose real name is Park Jae-sang, also had nothing but praise for Ban Ki-moon, and what his position means to South Koreans.

‘For all the Koreans he is the guy, you know, in everyone's heart in Korea, the best among the best.

‘To be here and he knows me, even the 
thing that he knows me is so touching right now, and he's saying he saw 
my video. He counted my video views,’ Psy said.

‘This is a much more better feeling than when I got No. 2 on Billboard.’

The playful photo opportunity was a break from the conflict and 
wars the UN chief usually deals with. Ban's spokesman, Martin Nesirky, 
told reporters the secretary-general thinks it's important to engage 
different parts of society.

Earlier, Ban met supersonic skydiver 
Felix Baumgartner and spoke admiringly of his death-defying leap last 
week from a balloon 24 miles (39 kilometers) above the Earth.

Baumgartner, whose jump broke the sound barrier and set a world record, offered to give Ban skydiving lessons.

The Korean YouTube phenomenon Gangnam Style now has over half a billion views on the video network site and has been parodied all over the world, from prisons to U.S. Congress elections to British private school Eton.

Gangnam Style is Korean slang referring to a luxurious lifestyle associated with the Gangnam district, an affluent and trendy area of Seoul known as 'South Korea's Beverly Hills'.
