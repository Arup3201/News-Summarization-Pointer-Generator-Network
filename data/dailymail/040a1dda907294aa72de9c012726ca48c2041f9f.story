A 10-month-old girl has died in Kansas after her foster father forgot her for more than two hours inside a car outside their home in 95-degree weather.

Neighbors
 say the baby was the foster child of two men who had as 
many as five children in the house.

Seth Michael Jackson, 29, was arrested on an aggravated child endangerment charge and hauled to Sedgwick County Jail, the Wichita Eagle reported.

Tragic: The little girl had been inside this Dodge Charger for more than two hours before the parents remembered her

Shocked: Neighbors hug in disbelief near the parked car where a 10-month-old Wichita girl died

The other 
dad, Payton Schroeder, has not been charged. He was already home 
when Jackson came in and assumed he'd brought the baby in, the paper reported.

Lieutenant
 Todd Ojile said Jackson picked up the 10-month-old from the babysitter 
and took her home about 4pm on Thursday. He went inside with a 
5-year-old child but had 'somehow forgotten' the baby strapped inside 
his gray Dodge Charger.

Hours
 later, Jackson saw something on television that made him 'remember the little girl was still in the car,' Ojile told reporters on 
Friday.

'They immediately rushed outside and found the child deceased in the vehicle,' he added.

Jackson and Schroeder called Wichita police about 7pm. First responders arrived minutes later and  pronounced dead at the scene.

Arrested: Jackson was booked into Sedgwick County Jail early morning on Friday on suspicion of aggravated endangerment of a child

Distraught: The little girl's biological grandmother, Cindy Poe, says she just wants to hold her baby girl one last time

One of 
the foster parents was 'hysterically crying' outside the house before they were both taken in by police for questioning.

'I just want see her, I just want to 
hold her, you know, for the last time,' the girl's biological grandmother, Cindy Poe, told KWCH-TV.

'That's what I'm 
trying to fight. They don't know if I can do that, I'm trying to fight 
to hold her.'

Two of the couple's other children, ages 5 and 7, were taken into protective custody.

'It’s very sad,' neighbor Sandy Jessogne told the Eagle. 'You wouldn’t expect it in your own yard.

'When I found out what happened I just couldn’t believe it.'

Temperatures in Wichita were sizzling at more than 95 degrees on Thursday.

After an hour, that kind of heat can make the inside of a car bake at nearly 130 degrees, The Weather Channel reported.

Like an Oven: After just 60 minutes, temperatures inside a car left out in 90-degree heat can feel like more than 130 degrees
