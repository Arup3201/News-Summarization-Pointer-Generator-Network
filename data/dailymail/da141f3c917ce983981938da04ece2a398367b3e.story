Posed up: British ISIS fighter Abu Abdullah Al-Habashi, 20, poses in front of a Syrian soldier strung up and decapitated in Syria

Up to 500 British Muslims are believed to be in the region with as many as half joining forces with ISIS, a group known for its extreme violence, including crucifying and beheading its enemies. 

Justifying the gruesome photo the British citizen originally from Eritrea told BBC's Newsnight: 'People love to see heads on spikes. I feel no sympathy for them because they are all enemies of Allah. 

'Isis treats its enemies in the same way they treat us'.

According to the BBC he has been based in the in Raqqa, Syria - an Isis stronghold - where many other Britons, including the female 'Terror Twins' from Manchester.

Salma and Zahra Halane, who have 28 GCSEs between them, ran away from their family in Chorlton, Greater Manchester, a month ago for 'paradise' in the war torn Middle East. 

It has also become renowned for the brutal executions, and crucifixions, of ISIS' enemies. 

Photographs posted on social media of Al-Habashi clutching a machine gun appear to show him across the border in Ramadi, Iraq, where he says he has been on the front line.

He said: 'It is the best fighting and the hardest. You are in a city of concrete and everything is blowing up'. 

Al-Habashi says his family know where he is and have told him: 'Come back - you are crazy'.

He has told them: 'This is for the sake of Allah. I'm free. Why would I come back to (go to) prison?'.  

Face of ISIS: Al-Habashi appeared on a video this weekend where he criticised democracy and demanded Sharia law

Propaganda: In the video a child is shown holding a machine gun with a caption about 'peace and security'

Message: The video promoting ISIS and its Caliphate was timed to coincide with Eid

The Muslim convert has  also urged others from the UK to fight in the Middle East and has the become the face of ISIS in its latest recruitment video.

Over the weekend a new film was released where he described how wonderful it was to live in the new Islamic Caliphate stretching across Syria and northern Iraq. 

It features fighters from the UK, Finland and America.

He says in a strong British accent: 'You're not living under oppression. You're not living under rule.

'As Muslims, that's what we want and that's what we need. We don't need any democracy, we don't need any communism, we don't need anything like that.'
