Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said he was willing to travel to Portugal to see first hand how the 'depenalisation' of drugs has worked in practice

Ministers are to examine Portugese laws to ‘depenalise’ drugs after a damning report said the government’s current strategy is not working.

Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said he was ready to visit Portugal to see first hand how the removal of criminal penalties for people caught with small amounts of drugs could help tackle the problem in the UK.

He insisted the government was ‘open to new ways of thinking’ after the Commons home affairs select committee asked for a royal commission to examine 
whether possession of drugs – even heroin and crack – should cease to be
a criminal offence.

The committee said it was 'impressed' by the Portugese system and 'alternative strategies should now be considered'.

Mr Browne said today: 'There are interesting new ideas. The report says we should look more carefully at the model that’s happened in Portugal.

'I’m certainly happy to go to Portugal as the report recommends and see what they’re doing there. So we should be open to new ideas and fresh thinking but we should also acknowledge that we’ve made a lot of progress in the last five or ten years.'

Mental health campaigners warned the link between cannabis and mental health should not be ignored.

But the committee said was clear from other countries that the British approach was not working, and alternative strategies - such as those developed in Portugal - should now be considered.

'We were impressed by what we saw of the Portuguese depenalised system. It had clearly reduced public concern about drug use in that country, and was supported by all political parties and the police,' it said.

'Although it is not certain that the Portuguese experience could be replicated in the UK, given societal differences, we believe this is a model that merits significantly closer consideration.'

Ministers should, it said, open discussions with the United Nations Commission on Drugs on new ways tackle what it called the 'global drugs dilemma' - including 'the possibility of legalisation and regulation'.

Legalise it: Some say a legalisation of drugs would prevent a black market and benefit Britain whilst anti-drugs charities say it will flood the country with drugs

However Mr Browne said so-called legal highs now posed a 'mutating threat' after an 'explosion' in their use in recent years.

'We have a growing problem with the 
drugs that are legal, so called legal highs and we have a diminishing 
problem with drugs that are illegal like heroin and crack cocaine. So I 
don’t think that it automatically follows that making drugs legal 
reduces harm.'

Mr Browne was forced to repeatedly deny the report would be shelved, as a senior Tory appeared to back a major
shift in drugs law by suggesting legal bans should be 
replaced by education for users.

On Twitter, Michael Fabricant, who is a Tory party vice-chairman, wrote: ‘Have often said: Prohibition in US didn’t work. Created crime & black market. Home Affairs Committee is right to ask if drug prohibition works.

‘If we spent the money on educating people that drugs are dangerous instead of attempting & failing to ban them, I suspect more effective.’

The committee’s conclusions were undermined however by detailed minutes of its meetings that showed three of its five Tory members voted against the recommendation to call for a royal commission.

The panel also split evenly on whether cannabis should be given a lower classification. That recommendation was included on the casting vote of the chairman, Labour MP Keith Vaz.

The report sparked fury among drugs campaigners – and ministers immediately ruled out major changes to the law.

Mary Brett, of the charity Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘A royal commission would cost the earth, and we do not need it to tell us what we already know: legalisation would open the floodgates and drug use would increase. It will also do nothing to help Colombia.’

Marjorie Wallace, of Sane, a mental health charity, said: ‘If the report is to be responsible, it must take account of the specific damage that cannabis can do to the developing brain.

‘Not only because recent studies have shown it inducing irreversible cognitive deterioration but in around 10 per cent of cases triggering severe psychotic illness.’

The MPs took evidence from comedian and former heroin addict Russell Brand, who said drug bans didn’t work, and Sir Richard Branson who said the sale of drugs should be permitted and taxed.

They visited Colombia to see the effects of the drugs trade, and met the country’s president. The report said the MPs ‘recognise and sympathise with the immense suffering and slaying of innocent people which tragically has taken place over the years in Colombia and other Latin American countries, as a result of the murderous rivalry between drug gangs.’

The MPs called for cannabis to be reclassified as a Class C drug from Class B. The report also claims the lack of a ban on cigarettes and alcohol can send a ‘confusing message’ to drug users.

A Government spokesman said: ‘We have no intention of downgrading or declassifying cannabis. A royal commission on drugs is simply not necessary.’
