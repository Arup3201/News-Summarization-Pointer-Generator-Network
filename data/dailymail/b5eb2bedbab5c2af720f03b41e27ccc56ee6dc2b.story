Mick Jagger put L'Wren Scott on the insurance for the Rolling Stones tour when friends knew she was suffering from depression, it was sensationally claimed last night.

In an extraordinary report The New York Post raises questions about what Mr Jagger should or could have known of his girlfriend’s struggles when he added her to the $13 million policy.

The newspaper also said that Miss Scott was due to visit a psychotherapist the day she died and that she refused to take antidepressants despite apparently being advised to do so.

L'Wren Scott's death prompted the Rolling Stones to postpone a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand, but their insurers are battling with the band to not pay out for losses. Pictured are Jagger and Miss Scott

The Stones have launched a $13 million lawsuit against their insurers after Miss Scott hanged herself on March 17 at her luxury Manhattan apartment.

They say they are entitled to the money because they had to postpone the Australia and New Zealand leg of their world tour because Mr Jagger, 71, was ‘stricken with grief’ and told not to perform for 30 days.

It is unclear when Ms Scott’s name was added to the Stones’ insurance policy. 

The London-based group of 12 insurers however are refusing because they say Miss Scott’s death was by her own hand and not ‘unforeseen’ because she has had pre-existing mental issues. 

Court documents made public this week reveal that Miss Scott, who died at the age of 49, was on the long list of family members who would trigger a payout if they were injured or killed.

The original insurance policy document, which the Stones signed up to, states that to the best of their knowledge 'no insured person has any physical, mental or medical condition or is undergoing any treatment, medical or otherwise, other than those advised to the insurers.'

A later clause says that this does not just cover the band but also those on the list of family members, which includes Miss Scott. 

Veteran Post show business columnist Richard Johnson wrote that Miss Scott was so disturbed that she posted alarming images on her Facebook page in the days before she died.

One of them was a photograph of Alfred Hitchcock strangling a goose which she had captioned ‘#fashionmoment’, which was deleted after her death.

Her Instagram account showed a very different life, however, and featured glamorous shots of her posing on rooftops and wearing expensive clothes in far flung locations. 

Jagger was 'diagnosed as suffering from acute traumatic stress disorder' after Scott's death

Journalist Phoebe Eaton, who investigated Miss Scott’s death for GQ magazine, told the Post: ‘Her friends knew she was cripplingly depressed.

‘It’s my understanding she refused to take antidepressants.’

Miss Scott’s friend Ellen Barkin was supposedly the one who would take her to therapy the day she died.

Instead the designer, who was feted by the likes of Michelle Obama, texted her British assistant Brittany Penebre to ‘come by’ to her home, which is where she found the body.

It has since emerged that LS Fashions, Miss Scott’s London-based company, owed £5.4 million and had to pay £850,000 of debts within a year.

She was reportedly ‘embarrassed’ by her business problems, which were so severe she had struggled to pay her staff and suppliers.

When Mr Jagger found out about her death, the papers reveal that he was so upset he was diagnosed with acute traumatic stress disorder, which can lead to nightmares and strong feelings of guilt.

The Stones postponed seven dates on their 14-date On Fire tour but after adding 13 more dates they are on course to rake in a staggering £62 million for the entire operation.

They sued their underwriters at the High Court in London but the insurers retaliated by claiming that it was ‘reasonable to infer Miss Scott had been suffering from a mental illness’, though they produced no proof to back this up.

Such a condition was ‘traceable to, or accelerated by, a condition for which she had received or been recommended medical attention’, they claimed.

Miss Barkin’s publicist said: ‘Ellen would never comment on this. She will always protect the privacy of L’Wren.’

Nobody for the Stones or Mr Jagger was available for comment. 

Court documents revealed that Jagger has 18 people on his insurance policy, including Ms Scott, Jerry Hall, seven children and four grandchildren

The Rolling Stones frontman published a statement on his website soon after L'Wren Scott's death saying he was struggling to understand why she would end her life

Hell-raisers: Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards

The Rolling Stones may still be going strong, but their court documents reveal that their disgruntled insurers are well aware of the toll taken by years of the rockstar lifestyle.

Hidden among the fine print of their tour insurance policy is a long list of exceptions – health issues for which each member of the ageing band is not covered.

For example, and perhaps not surprisingly, the insurers say they will not pay out if anything happens to guitarist Keith Richards related to ‘alcohol abuse, liver failure and/or disease and osteoarthritis’.

More unusually, anything to do with the injury that he suffered in 2006, when he was hit on the head by a coconut, will not be covered either.

For Ronnie Wood, anything to do with ‘alcohol abuse’ is also not covered. The exemptions for drummer Charlie Watts include any conditions related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004 or his sciatica.

The documents show the band expected to receive £28million for their tour. Just three shows in Japan were worth £9million.
