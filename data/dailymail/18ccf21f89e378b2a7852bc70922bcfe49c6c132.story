'This should be fun': Former Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman, 64, has been signed by Channel 4 to host its General Election night coverage on 7 May next year

Former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman will host Channel 4's General Election night coverage next year, it was announced today.

The outspoken broadcaster was one of the BBC's biggest stars before he quit earlier this year after 25 years as host of the corporation's flagship current affairs show.

Now Paxman, 64, will go head to head with former colleagues including David Dimbleby and Huw Williams when he anchors Channel 4's election night coverage on 7 May next year.

The veteran inquisitor said: 'There are new and interesting questions to ask about the way we choose our government.

'This should be fun.' 

Channel 4's chief creative officer, Jay Hunt, said: 'Jeremy is a compelling presenter and makes truly unmissable TV for those big political moments.

'His sense of mischief and danger make him a fantastic fit with Four.' 

A spokesman for the channel said that Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow would continue to anchor election coverage for news, saying: 'As in previous years, Jon will be the key anchor for C4 News during the election period'. 

At the last General Election, Channel 4 won critical acclaim for its 'alternative' broadcast hosted by presenters including David Mitchell, Lauren Laverne, and Jimmy Carr, which it claimed outperformed ITV's coverage.

Signing Paxman, who spent his entire working life at the BBC before he presented his last Newsnight in June, to sign next year's election night is something of a coup for the broadcaster, which would not disclose how much he will be paid for fronting the election as a one-off.

Paxman's departure from Newsnight came amid reports he had not been happy with the BBC, and in particular with Newsnight under new editor Ian Katz, for some time. 

Earlier this month Katz, who joined Newsnight from the Guardian, told the Evening Standard about his working relationship with Paxman, saying: 'He’s dyspeptic about pretty much everything. Ideas are flattened.

'Almost everything you suggest Jeremy will think is "preposterous", or "infantile" or an otherwise "completely lamentable" idea, and that’s a challenge because you have to sell it to him.'

Critics suggested the current affairs show appeared more lightweight under Katz's tenure, with stunts including presenter Kirsty Wark dancing to Michael Jackson's Thriller on Halloween last year, and a long interview with comedian Russell Brand.

Paxman left Newsnight amid reports he was unhappy with new editor, Ian Katz's, tenure there - it was accused of dumbing down with stunts including presenter Kirsty Wark dancing along to Michael Jackson's Thriller

Earlier this year Paxman admitted he wanted to tell viewers that Newsnight wasn't worth watching, saying he'd like to tell them 'I'd go to bed if I were you'.

And he got into trouble with Radio 1 bosses over comments he made to another newspaper saying that his 'idea of hell' was getting into a BBC lift 'which has Radio 1 Extra plumbed into it - I don't quite understand why the BBC does Radio 1 Extra'.

The BBC's election night coverage will be anchored by David Dimbleby from the close of polls at 10pm until the following morning, when Huw Edwards will take over from 7am to 10pm.

Dimbleby, 75, presented his first General Election coverage when Margaret Thatcher swept to power in 1979, while Edwards, 53, has presented several election specials, as well as Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton in 2011.

James Harding, the BBC's director of news, said: 'This election is likely to be one of the most complex and closely fought in recent times and we are delighted to have such an experienced team to lead our coverage.'

Newsnight is now presented by a team including Emily Maitlis, Kirsty Wark, Laura Kuenssberg, and, from next week, BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Evan Davis will join as 'lead anchor'.
