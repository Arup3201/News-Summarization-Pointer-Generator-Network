A woman who admitted drowning her three young children in her Long Island bathtub five years ago has given birth to a fourth child while incarcerated in a secure psychiatric hospital, the I-Team has reported.

Leatrice Brewer, 33, was found not guilty because of mental disease or defect in the 2008 deaths of her children, and has been held ever since at the secure Mid-Hudson Forensic Psychiatric Center in New Hampton.

Her case returned to the public eye recently because she is trying to collect $350,000 from a settlement that the childrens’ fathers won from Nassau County in wrongful death lawsuits.

But now Innocent Demesyeux, the father of two of the three children Brewer killed, says he has been contacted by a lawyer trying to find an appropriate placement for the newborn Brewer had while in custody.

'She told me Leatrice had a baby while she was in that facility,' Mr Demesyeux said in an interview.

It is unclear who the new baby’s father is, or under what circumstances Brewer became pregnant. The state Office of Mental Health, which oversees Mid-Hudson, declined to comment, citing privacy laws.

Attorney Tom Foley, who represents Mr Demesyeux, said 'it's outrageous' that Brewer was able to conceive a child while incarcerated.

'This person's supposedly in a secure facility and she gets pregnant. This is the woman who had no idea what she was doing when she murdered her children.'

Because she was technically found not responsible for the children's deaths, lawyers say she may be able to claim some or all of the $350,000 estate their fathers won.

However, even if the judge rules she can collect, Brewer is not expected to see any of the money: there is a $1.2 million security payment listed against her for the cost of psychiatric counseling and other services she has received since her arrest, lawyers have said.

Another option the court could consider is to award some or all of the money to Brewer's baby as her heir.

It is unclear who currently has custody of the newborn.

After Nassau Surrogates Court Judge Edward McCarty decides whether Brewer is entitled to collect, he must make a similar ruling about the children's two fathers. If he finds that the men effectively abandoned their children, they may not be entitled to any money, lawyers say.

The judge has scheduled a hearing on the matter on November 6.

Brewer's case drew has drawn attention to the actions of Nassau County's social services agency, whose caseworkers visited the mother's apartment two days before the killings and found no one home but neglected to schedule an immediate follow-up visit. Two social workers were later suspended.

Lawsuits against the county filed by the father of Brewer's one-year-old son, Innocent Demesyeux, and five-year-old son, Michael Demesyeux, were settled for $250,000. A lawsuit filed by the father of Brewer's six-year-old daughter, Jewell Ward, was recently settled for $100,000.
