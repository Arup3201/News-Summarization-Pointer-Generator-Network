A 20km-high ash cloud from the volcanic eruption of Mount Sangeang Api in Indonesia is playing havoc with Australia's flight paths.

Darwin remains cut off to all air services and thousands of people have been left stranded in the city after the ash cloud blew over the Northern Territory coast line, forcing the airport to close.

Flights from Darwin will remain cancelled until at least Sunday, while ash plumes are also affecting other aircraft around the country bound for Bali, with the island's airspace is also disrupted.

On Saturday night, all flights from Melbourne to Bali were cancelled, reported The Age.

'Our team of meteorologists are continuing to monitor the situation, in consultation with the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre,' Virgin Australia spokeswoman Jacqui Abbott said.

Planes at East Kimberley Regional Airport in West Australia have also been grounded due to the plumes.

Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss told AAP flights coming across the Top End could be affected for days.

'Depending on wind and other weather conditions, the ash has the potential to affect flights to and from other airports, including Brisbane, during coming days,' he said. 'This is currently being fully assessed.'

The powerful explosion took place at Mount Sangeang Api in the Lesser Sunda Islands - an area that plays host to 129 active volcanoes. The Sunda Islands sit inside Indonesia's notorious 'Ring of Fire'. Since Sangiang Api's first recorded eruption in 1512, it is believed to have erupted a total of 20 times

The volcano, Sangeang Api, in Indonesia's Lesser Sunda Island has erupted three times since Friday afternoon, with the first ash cloud, between 20,000 and 50,000 feet high and up to 15km wide, moving south-easterly over central Australia on Saturday night at about 100 knots but scattering quickly.

The plume has been affecting Darwin and is expected to be in the area for the next 18 hours to 24 hours, reported Seven News.

A second cloud at about 45,000 feet was over Darwin and moving east at about 60 knots, while the third ash cloud, north-east of Bali, is expected to miss Australian airspace.

Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre meteorologist Tim Birch  said it was impossible to prediction how long the ash cloud would affect flights to and from Darwin.

'It is entirely dependent upon what happens with the volcano.,' he said. 

But using current weather conditions and looking at volcanic action, Mr Birtch said it was likely that eastern ports including Sydney and Brisbane would not be affected.

On Saturday morning at least 18 flights were cancelled coming in and out of the airport, The Australian reported.

Domestic and international flights run by Virgin, Jetstar, Qantas, Emirates, Malaysia, SilkAir and Airnorth airlines were abandoned. It is not known when flights will resume.

A Jetstar spokesman confirmed 530 passengers were affected by the cancellations, while Qantas passengers have been put up at the Rydges Darwin Hotel Airport to wait until the cloud passes.

'We offered accommodation to passengers around the country as a result of (the cancellations),' a Qantas spokeswoman said.

She said people could keep up-to-date with flight information by logging on to the Qantas website. 

On its website, Virgin said its team of meteorologist would continue monitoring the situation along with the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in the Northern Territory capital.

'We will recommence normal operations as soon as the volcanic ash cloud safely allows it. All guests will be re-accommodated onto alternate flights,' a statement said.

The ash cloud off the coast is moving south towards Alice Springs and is sitting between 6km and 13km above the ground.

Mr Truss said it had potential to affect flights at other airports but Airservices Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Bureau of Meteorology were continuing to monitor the cloud.

'Passengers are advised to check with their airlines for further information,' he said.

Airservices Australia - the nation's air navigation authority - has started diverting international flights around the cloud.

The bureau's Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre manager Emile Jansons said the cloud was dispersing but this could change.

The Sangeang Api volcano is about 1400km away from Darwin and has erupted three times since Friday afternoon

Mr Jansons said it was moving at 130km/h to 150km/h towards the centre of Australia and they were not expecting it to impact on Brisbane or Sydney right now.

'There is a very strong jet stream so the boundary (of the cloud) may come further south,' he told AAP.

The current advice from the bureau is the ash cloud will continue to cover the Northern Territory coast for another 18 hours.

Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson said the issue with flying near or through the cloud was not just visibility, but the effect it had on the plane.

He said silica contained in the cloud could cause extensive damage to a jet.

'The damage it can do to the aircraft can be abrasive,' Mr Gibson said.

'It can melt and stick to the engine.'

The Bureau of Meteorology is monitoring the situation.

After erupting, the volcano sent a distinctive spaceship-shaped ring of pyroclastic smoke high into the air. Pilots in the area reported seeing the cloud rise 20km high, spreading over a 40km area

The volcano sits in Indonesia's notorious 'Ring of Fire' - an area where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur in the basin of the Pacific Ocean. It has 452 volcanoes - 75 per cent of the world's total

This is not the first time flights have been cancelled because of volcanic ash.

In 2010, Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull eruption caused massive flight delays across western and northern Europe over six days in April, affecting hundreds of thousands of people, but interruptions to local flights continued through until May.

The incredible moment Indonesia's huge volcano erupted, sending ash spewing an estimated 20 kilometres into the sky, was captured in pictures.

The powerful explosion took place at Mount Sangeang Api in the Lesser Sunda Islands - an area that plays host to 129 active volcanoes - and sent a distinctive spaceship-shaped ring of pyroclastic smoke high into the air.

The photographs were taken by professional photographer Sofyan Efendi during a commercial flight from Bali to the fishing town of Labuan Bajo in West Nusa Tenggara province.

The arrival and departure screens from inside the Darwin Airport show the number of flights cancelled. 530 Jetstar passengers have been affected by the cancellations on Saturday

Scores of farmers who work but do not live on the Indonesian island were ordered to leave and not return until the volcano has finished erupting, said Muhammad Hendrasto, head of Indonesia's National Volcanology Agency. There are not believed to have been any deaths or injuries as a result of the eruption.

Authorities have had Mount Sangiang Api on high alert for almost a year, he told China's Xinhua news agency.
