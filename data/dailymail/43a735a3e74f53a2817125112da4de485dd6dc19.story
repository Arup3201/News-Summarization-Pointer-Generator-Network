A British expat has appeared in a Tanzanian court after a trophy hunters’ haul of ivory elephants’ tusks, lions’ claws and a rhino’s head was allegedly seized at his home.

Robert Dewar, 64, was arrested at his house in Mbezi Beach, an affluent coastal suburb of Dar es Salaam, at 8.30pm on Friday.

Police commissioner Suleiman Kova said: ‘The suspect was found with eight pieces of ivory tusks, eight masks made of ivory, 20 lion teeth, 22 lion nails and a live parrot.’

Police believe he was about to send a piece of hippopotamus skin abroad.

They allegedly also confiscated 15 ivory belts and large amounts of ebony and uncut gems.

The loot, with a black market value of hundreds of thousands of pounds, is all thought to have originated in Tanzania.

The country has become a key exit point for ivory smugglers amid a growing crisis for endangered animals, a damning report by the Elephant Trade Information System claims.

Mr Dewar, a logistics expert, was remanded in custody until a High Court date this month.

The Daily Mail contacted his company, Trans Afrikans Logistics, in Johannesburg but was told it shut down abruptly last year.

Tanzania has become a major exit point for ivory smugglers according to a damning new report.

Kenya and Tanzania together make up half of all seizures since 2009, the report by the Elephant Trade Information System found, with elephants facing the worst conservation crisis since a ban in trade was introduced in 1989.

The main destinations are China and Thailand where endangered animals’ body parts are commonly used in traditional medicines.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
