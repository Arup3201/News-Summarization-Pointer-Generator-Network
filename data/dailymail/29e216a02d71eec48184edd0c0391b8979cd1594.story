Speaker of the House John Boehner pressed President Barack Obama to come up with a strategy to defeat the Islamic State today, telling reporters at a press conference this morning that it is eight months overdue.

'I’ve been calling for a strategy to deal with the growing terrorist threat since January, when ISIS came across the border in western Iraq,' Boehner said this morning ahead of a meeting with Obama in the Oval Office.

'We have a very serious problem, and what we need is a strategy, he added.

Boehner's office said later that the Speaker looks forward to hearing about the president plans to decimate the extremist group that has taken over large swaths of land in Iraq and Syria during his address to the nation tomorrow night. The statement suggests Obama did not reveal his strategy to Boehner during their meeting today. 

Still waiting: House Speaker John Boehner said today that Obama's strategy for destroying the Islamic State is eight months overdue

Obama pow wowed with Boehner, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell this afternoon at the White House.

Administration officials will also meet with key Senators tomorrow. Members of the House won't have the opportunity to question the president until Thursday, after his address.

An aide to the Speaker told reporters in an email Tuesday night that Boehner 'made it clear that ISIL is preparing to fight us' during his meeting with Obama and told the president 'that as we learned in Syria, the longer we wait, the more difficult our choices become.'

'It is in the best interests of the United States and our allies to put in place a strategy that rises to the challenge of the threat we face, and takes the fight directly to ISIL in a decisive fashion,' Boehner said, according to his office.

Boehner also expressed concern during the meeting that there may be weaknesses in border and homeland security policies 'that could expose the homeland to an immediate ISIL-linked attack,' the aide said.  

'The Speaker looks forward to hearing the president outline a comprehensive strategy for destroying and defeating ISIL tomorrow night,' the aide added.

The White House was even more tight lipped about Obama's meeting with Congressional leadership.

It said in a statement after the meeting that President told attendees 'he would welcome action by the Congress that would aid the overall effort and demonstrate to the world that the United States is united in defeating the threat from ISIL.'

'The President and his team look forward to continuing extensive consultation with Congress,' the statement said.

Obama has kept his plans under close wraps since announcing tomorrow's address during an interview with NBC's Chuck Todd last weekend.

The Commander in Chief told the Meet the Press host that his strategy would include military, economic and political components but gave out few other details.

Obama indicated that his plan would likely take 'some resources above...what we are currently doing' while declining to provide specifics.

The president suggested he would not need the legislative branch's approval to take action, however, and plainly stated he had no intention of putting troops on the ground Iraq or Syria.

'This is not the equivalent of the Iraq war,' he said.

The Hill reported on Monday that the Obama may ask Congress to revisit his request for a $5 billion counter terrorism fund, however.

When the White House first asked Congress for the money it said $2.5 billion would go toward providing training and weaponry to international partners, according to the Hill.

Another $1.5 billion would be directed to Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq to support Syrian refugee camps.

Just $500 million of the fund was to be allotted to 'unforeseen contingencies related to counterterrorism or regional instability.'

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that the counterrorism fund ' is a core component of the president’s strategy for dealing' with extremists in Iraq and Syria and 'and other issues like it around the globe.'

Earnest said Obama would use the money to 'build up effective partners so that when the United States has to confront threats like this, that we have well-trained, well-equipped, effective partners that we can work with to confront these problems.'

What is unclear is how Obama plans to stop jihadists ransacking Iraq and Syria at present.

The United States had already launched 153 airstrikes on the Islamic State in Iraq as of Tuesday afternoon. It has not engaged the group militarily in Syria.

Lawmakers are divided over whether the president needs authority from Congress to continue its bombing campaign in Iraq and whether it ought to begin striking Syria.

The president is legally required by the War Powers Resolution to ask for Congress' approval of military action after 60 days of war with a country. 

A bipartisan group of lawmakers are claiming that Obama must ask for the legislative branch's permission to carry out airstrikes in Iraq after the 60 day cut off on October 7.

Boehner said Tuesday he wasn't convinced that the situation in Iraq constituted as a war, though, and refused to speculate further on possible military actions Obama could take.

'I am looking for a strategy from the president that takes on this terrorist threat and defeats it,' he told a reporter who asked whether he was 'opposed to ground troops' at the presser.

Other congressional leaders have avoided advocating specific action in Iraq and Syria as well.

House Democratic caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra told reporters on Tuesday that members of the president's party were waiting for Obama to articulate his strategy before forming an opinion on the issue.

'Don't ask us what you think we should do, just tell us what you're going to do,' Becerra said, according to The Hill.
