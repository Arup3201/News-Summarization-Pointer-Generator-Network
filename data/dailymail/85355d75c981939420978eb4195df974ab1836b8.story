Arsenal's training was cut short by a storm but that bad weather could not force England midfielder Jack Wilshere to head for cover.

Not for the first time this summer the 22-year-old was causing a splash but at least this was a laughing matter. Wilshere threw himself around in enormous puddles that appeared on the pitches after the storm.

The Gunners had been training prior to the downpour but even Arsene Wenger was forced to call it quits when torrents began cascading down on them.
