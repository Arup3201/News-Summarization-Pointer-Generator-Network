A 23-year-old university student has become the first known recruit from Western Australia to flee the country to join terrorist group Islamic State.

Perth university student Muhammed Sheglabo flew to the Middle East after telling his parents that he was going away on a camping trip in January.

His family contacted the police when they were not able to contact him, and were reportedly heartbroken when they were informed of his decision.

'His mother has not stopped crying since we learnt of this news. I have told her we need to forget about him now,' Sheglabo's father told The West Australian.

'But inside my heart is breaking...Sometimes they [your children] hide things from you that you could not even imagine,' he said. 

Sheglabo, who migrated with his family from Libya in 2010, is believed to be fighting with Islamic State forces in Al-Furat province, near the Syria-Iraq border. 

The 23-year-old's newly created Twitter page featured photos of himself with knives and AK-47s, outfitted in combat clothing.

'Pass my greetings to my family and tell them don't cry, be happy, ur son is here,' he Tweeted earlier in February.

Sheglabo's father said that the economics student became secretive about his personal life last year, and began training in martial arts.

He brought notorious hate preacher Junaid Thorne to their family home in the middle of 2014, and one of his most recent tweets boasted of his preparations for going into battle for God.

He asked his friends to pray for him and asked for victory. 

While Sheglabo's parents said they didn't want to speak out harshly against the terrorist group out of fear or revenge attacks, they expressed their desire for their son to stay away from the barbarous activities IS is notorious for.

Their comments follow the revelation that nearly all of the 'home-grown' terrorists who have left the country to join IS were on welfare payments when they fled.

An audit of the 57 Australians who joined the terrorist group prior to October last year shows that 55 were on the dole or some form of welfare, reported The Saturday Telegraph. 

The Federal investigation confirmed that the Australians recieved benefits including youth and carer's allowance, Newstart, sickness, and the Disability Support Pension.

Many had continued to receive the benefits while fighting in the Middle East, including Khaled Sharrouf, which Prime Minister Tony Abbott has labelled appalling.

'As a nation, we were ­repulsed when images started appearing in the media last year of Australian members of the Islamist death cult gloating over the corpses of their victims and brandishing severed heads,' Mr Abbott wrote for The Saturday Telegraph.

'I was equally appalled when I was briefed last September that 55 out of 57 Australians then believed to be fighting in Syria and Iraq with ISIL and other terrorist groups had been on some form of welfare, including the Disability Support Pension.'

The Prime Minister is scheduled to deliver his first national security address on Monday to detail the launch of a counter-terrorism taskforce.

He will also announce strict new laws to prevent the reign of extremist groups in Australia.
