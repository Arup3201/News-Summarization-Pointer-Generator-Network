Match Of The Day pundits are being urged to be forthright in their opinions in a bid to combat their more controversial rivals on Sky and BT Sport.

The BBC's flagship football show now faces unprecedented competition from their paid-for rivals and Alan Shearer, Robbie Savage and Rio Ferdinand have been told to be unafraid to let rip with their true opinions, however controversial. in a bid to keep ratings.

Executives at the corporation are likely concerned about the departure of the outspoken Alan Hansen after 22 years on the MOTD sofa, combined with the successful pairing of Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville have made Sky's Monday Night Football coverage a must-watch for lovers of the beautiful game.

Mark Cole, head of football at the BBC, is trying to balance stirring up opinions with avoiding alienating the show's 10m viewers.

He told The Independent: 'It's okay to have people throwing the remote controls at the telly.

'We want all the guys to offer opinions. But it needs to be balanced and they cannot be changing their minds next week. It has to come from the heart.'

He added that the extensive use of technology used by Sky would not appeal to the BBC's core audience, who would find a 13-minute technical analysis 'too long, too intricate and too complicated'.

Cole also addressed criticism about the absence of a woman in the MOTD line-up, claiming that pundits must have played the game at the highest level to get a spot on the sofa. However, presenters Jacqui Oatley and Gabby Logan will feature next season.

The BBC has signed up Phil Neville for this season's MOTD despite his much-criticised performance in the commentary box at the World Cup.

The former Everton and Manchester United star is joining show veterans Alan Shearer, Robbie Savage and Danny Murphy alongside other newcomers Ruud Gullit and Rio Ferdinand.

Neville admitted working as a commentator was 'harder' than he thought after hundreds of viewers complained about his on-air performance during the World Cup game between England and Italy.

Viewers criticised his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during the game with several Twitter users joking that England physio Gary Lewin who was stretchered off after injuring his ankle had actually 'fallen into a coma' listening to Neville.

On Neville's appointment, Cole said: 'After 22 years, Alan Hansen will no longer be with the show, but the World Cup really showcased the strength of the new BBC punditry team.

'We will continue to evolve the Saturday night panel and feel we have a really good blend of regular studio guests.

'Alan Shearer has established himself as one of the top pundits in the UK, while Danny Murphy and Philip Neville will regularly provide added tactical analysis.

'There will be strong opinions from Ruud Gullit and Robbie Savage, while Rio Ferdinand will continue to give excellent insight around his playing commitments.

'We will continue to mix our team of regular analysts with current players and managers, which featured Roy Hodgson, Thierry Henry, Vincent Kompany and Roberto Martinez last season.

'We are confident we have put together a varied team full of insight and opinion, led by Gary Lineker, who has consistently proved to be amongst the best presenters in the UK.'

The show celebrates 50 years since its first broadcast this year with a one-off documentary being shown on Friday August 22.
