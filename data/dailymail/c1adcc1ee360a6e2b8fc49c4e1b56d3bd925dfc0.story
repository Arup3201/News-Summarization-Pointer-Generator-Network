Dressed in drab red jumpers, two children climb to the top of a rubbish heap a dozen times taller than them.

The shocking scene is typical of Buenos Aires' Matanza-Riachuelo river basin, one of the ten most polluted places in the world.

A list of ten filthy sites, from Russia to Indonesia to Ghana, has been amassed by the global environmental group The Blacksmith Institute - which says 200 million people are endangered daily in the top ten places alone.

1: Matanza-Riachuelo River Basin, Buenos Aires. It is just 37 miles long but its banks are packed with 15,000 industries spewing chemicals like zinc, lead, copper, nickel and chromium into the filthy water

Filthy: Some parts of the river basin look normal, but 60% of its homes are deemed unfit for human habitation. Residents suffer diarrhoea, breathing difficulties and cancer as there are few sources of safe drinking water

Some governments are working to make life better but in others, the damage has already been done.

On the list is the former Soviet nuclear plant Chernobyl, which suffered a massive meltdown in 1986 in what is widely known as the worst nuclear disaster in history.

Others, though, few people have heard of. Deep in the wastes of Siberia is the industrial city of Norislk. Founded by Stalin in 1935 to provide forced labour for the gulags, it was for decades the largest heavy metals mine in the world.

It has leaked millions of tons of copper oxide, nickel oxide and sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, causing lung diseases and cancers of the digestive tract.

The report - which says six of the sites are new to the list since it was last compiled in 2006 - said symptoms of people suffering from pollution include organ damage, diahrroea, eye damage, vomiting, lung diseases, cancers and premature birth.

2: Norilsk, Siberia. Once the largest heavy metals smelting complex in the world, Stalin built it and forced gulag prisoners to work there. Life expectancy for factory workers is 10 years below the Russian average

Smog: High levels of copper and nickel have been found in the soil 'nearly everywhere' within 40 miles of Norilsk, Russia, where 130,000 people live. Children get sick one and a half times more often than those nearby

Ominous: Norilsk, Russia, pictured in 1993. Two million tons of sulphur dioxide pour into the air every year

The lack of good medical care in poorer countries means they are particularly vulnerable - explaining, in part, why many of the worst places are in what was traditionally called the Third World.

The report said: 'The shortage of adequate resources in many low-and middle-income countries increases the severity of health impacts from toxic pollution while simultaneously marginalizing those who need help the most.

'An objective of the work of Blacksmith Institute and Green Cross Switzerland and one goal of this report is to enhance understanding and funding for this crucial area of public health.'

3: Citarum River Basin, Indonesia. Some nine million people live along its banks and it provides 80% of Jakarta's drinking water - but scientists have found lead at more than 1,000 times the recommended level

Horrifying: But the report said the Indonesian government is trying to solve the river's huge health risks

The most densely-populated area, Indonesia's Citarum River Basin, is home to some nine million people but also countless factories and industrial sites.

Despite providing 80% of Jakarta's drinking water it has lead at more than 1,000 times the recommended level and manganese at four times the recommended level.

Meanwhile Hazaribagh in Bangladesh has a more unexpected source of pollution - it is teeming with almost 300 tanneries to make leather.

4: Kabwe, Zambia's second-biggest city, once held one of the world's largest lead mines. Children have up to ten times the recommended level of lead in their blood. The government did not tackle the problem for 90 years

The process of making leather uses dangerous amounts of the chemical hexavalent chromium, which was made famous as a water pollutant in the Hollywood film Erin Brockovich.

The chemical causes cancer and is almost universally banned throughout Europe, but it is among the 22,000 cubic litres of toxic waste dumped into Hazaribagh's water supply every day.

Tannery workers' homes are built next to contaminated streams, ponds and canals and they suffer horrifying symptoms including skin rashes, acid burns, dizziness and nausea.

5: Hazaribagh, Bangladesh, is home to 270 tanneries for making leather - which together dump 22,000 cubic litres of toxic waste every day including the cancer-causing chemical hexavalent chromium

Dangerous: Hexavalent chromium was made famous by the film Erin Brockovich, which documented the story of an American junior lawyer and single mother who campaigned to expose water pollution

In Kalimantan, Indonesia, a long history of gold mining is to blame. The process uses large quantities of the toxic chemical mercury - causing decades of health problems for its residents.

The Western world has a big part to play in the levels of pollution in these countries, the report said.

Dr Jack Caravanos, assistant director of research at the Blacksmith Institute, told the Earth Island Journal: '[In the United States,] your whole body is covered with products whose fundamental chemical ingredients have likely come from other countries. The contamination stayed in those countries.'

People in Kalimantan eat fish containing up to double the recommended levels of mercury

7: Pripyat, Ukraine, played host to the massive meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986. It is deserted, a ghost town which has become an eerie haunt only for investigators and photographers of its crumbling homes

Toxic: The Chernobyl nuclear reactor 26 years after the meltdown which killed thousands. It is now cased in concrete, but there are still dangerous levels of radioactive particles in the soil for miles around

The report said several governments, especially in Indonesia, are doing their best to tackle the problems.

Others have been taken off the 'worst ten' list since 2006, including sites in Peru, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, India and Azerbaijan.

But the report admits there will inevitably be pollution scandals waiting to be uncovered.

It said: 'These listings, as explicitly acknowledged in the reports, were based on limited information and data.

'This was only to be expected, since pollution by its nature shuns the spotlight.'

8: The Niger River Delta, Nigeria, is home to some of the world's biggest petrochemical plants and saw almost 7,000 spills from 1976 to 2001 where the oil was never recovered. A quarter of children are starving

Toxic: The Niger delta is also home to crime - pictured is a boat which was burned by authorities after being loaded with stolen oil. An average of 240,000 barrels of crude oil are spilt every year in the area

9: Dzershinsk, Russia, a Soviet industrial city where 300,000 tons of chemical waste were put into unsafe forms of landfill - many of them seeping into groundwater. Three of the worst ten are in former Soviet states

10: The Agbogbloshie Dumpsite in Accra, Ghana, is where many western computers end up without the resources to process them properly. Styrofoam packaging and rubber-sheathed cables are all burned
