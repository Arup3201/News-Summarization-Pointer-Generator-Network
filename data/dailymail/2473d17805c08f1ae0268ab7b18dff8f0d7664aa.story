They're among the most iconic artifacts of British culture, recognised the world over by their bright red exterior. 

But the quintessential red phone box is being reinvented to accommodate a generation of mobile-phone users.

Instead of metal headsets and coin slots, the booths are to be fitted with coffee machines, sweet jars and shoe shine as part of the scheme. 

Phone boxes across London are to be refurbished in to coffee shops by the Red Kiosk Company. It comes after the success of Red Box coffee in Brighton (pictured)

Of the 669 remaining K6 Kiosks, 100 will be adapted by the Red Kiosk Company.

For £5,000-a-pop, the company will transform them into miniature businesses and give jobs to the long-term unemployed. 

The 100 Kiosks have been taken on via the BT Adopt a Phonebox scheme. 

For as little as £1, local authorities and charities can take ownership of one of the iconic boxes and protect its heritage. 

If the new owner decides to fit a defibrillator in their kiosk, BT will supply free red paint for them to coat its exterior.   

Scotland's smallest internet cafe can be found in Ballogie where visitors can make themselves a cup of tea or coffee and use the internet

Twelve of its planning applications for Kiosks have already been approved, the Evening Standard reports.

The scheme has already seen success in Brighton, where two previously disused phone boxes have been turned into Red Box Coffee and Ice Cream shops. 

And in Scotland a council took ownership of one of the boxes to create the country's smallest internet cafe. 

Visitors to the box in Ballogie, Aberdeenshire, can make themselves a cup of tea or coffee while connecting to the internet. An honesty box has been placed to encourage customers to pay for the service.

In Argyll a previously empty box was fitted with a defibrillator upon the suggestion of a local girl guide. 

Heather Munro won a local competition appealing for the best use of the box in 2011. Its location in the Highlands is a passing point for many hikers who have, villagers said, had heart problems in the past. 

In 1868, the Telegraph Act granted the Postmaster General (the office of the General Post Office) the right to acquire privately-owned telegraph companies. 

Sixteen years later, the first public boxes appeared on British streets, with the first police box appearing in Glasgow in 1891.

In 1923, a national competition was held to source a new design for the kiosks across London. It was held by the Metropolitan Boroughs Joint Standing Committee. 

After several different styles of kiosk, 8,000 of the K6 were distributed across the UK in 1936. 

But in 1969, the Metropolitan Police began decommissioning its network of police boxes. A decade later, the Post Office - which had acquired the boxes - is split into two companies, and they become the responsibility of BT. 

With the introduction of mobile phones, the use of public phone boxes deteriorated rapidly over the following decades. 

In 2008, British Telecommunications launched the Adopt a Kiosk scheme to revive the disused boxes. 

By 2011, 1500 kiosks had been adopted under the scheme. The following year it was revealed that of the 50,000-odd public phones in the UK, only around 11,000 were red boxes.
