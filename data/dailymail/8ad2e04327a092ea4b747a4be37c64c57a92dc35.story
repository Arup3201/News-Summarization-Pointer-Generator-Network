Greg Hardy, 25, faces two charges after his girlfriend reported that he battered her Tuesday

One of the Carolina Panthers' biggest stars has been arrested on charges that he beat and threatened his girlfriend at his downtown condo in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Greg Hardy, 25, whose ferocity as a defensive end earned him the nickname 'Da Kraken,' was jailed Tuesday on charges of assault on a woman and communicating threats.

His 24-year-old girlfriend had bruises and scratches when police arrived at Hardy's condo about 4am Tuesday, according to a report.

She told officers that she had been dating the 6-foot-4 Pro Bowl player since last September.

She had been drinking at the time of the alleged attack, according to police.

The domestic violence arrest is just the latest trouble for Hardy - who saw his position in the 2010 NFL draft fall after teams became concerned over his off-the-field behavior, the Charlotte Observer reports.

Hardy is one of the biggest stars on the Panthers. He recorded 15 sacks last year, a franchise record, and was named to the Pro Bowl.

The team is currently in negotiations to sign him to a long-term contract and make him the highest-paid player on the team.

He was named a 'franchise' player and is owed a contact that will pay him at least $13.1million this year - a tenfold increase from his $1.3million salary last year. 

At the University of Mississippi, Hardy was suspended for two games for missing meetings and violating rules.

Hardy's on-the-field alter ego is Da Kraken, a nickname he earned because of his ferocity. He recorded 15 sacks last year

In 2011, he crashed his motorcycle and received injuries that kept him out of most pre-season training. 

In the summer 2012, he tweeted a picture of the speedometer of his Bentley clocking over 100mph.

Last season, he was benched and fined by the team after missing a team meeting. He was forced to apologize to the head coach before he could return.

He has also been ticketed three times for speeding - including once going 86mph in a 65mph zone.
