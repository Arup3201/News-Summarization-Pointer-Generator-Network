The mysterious vandals who have been stealing American flags from the tombstones of Civil War soldiers have been caught.

But the unlikely culprits are much different from ordinary cemetery vandals.

By setting up surveillance cameras throughout the historic Hudson, New York cemetery, police found that none other than woodchucks – the rodents that help predict the weather every February in Punxsutawney– were responsible for the grave’s defacing.

Police were suspicious when small American flags in the Grand Army of the Republic section of Cedar Park Cemetery began disappearing, thinking that teenagers using the cemetery as a hang-out could be to blame.

Mayor Bill Hallenback told the Register-Star earlier this week that it is a relief to discover who – or what- was behind the defacing.

He said that the miniature flags are 
coated with a substance that the woodchucks find enticing, and found out
that other towns were having the same problem with rodents taking 
flags.

In total, 75 flags were reported missing, shocking locals who couldn’t believe someone would want to deface the graves of those killed in the line of duty.

In one night alone, 17 flags disappeared from the soldiers’ graves.

Authorities set up surveillance cameras to catch the culprits in the act. They were surprised to see that the groundhogs living within the cemetery were to blame.

‘I’m glad we don’t have someone who has taken it upon themselves to desecrate the stones and the flags in front of them,’ Mayor Hallenback said.

The mayor added that scraps of the flags were found in the woodchuck’s burrows.

Cemetery caretaker Vincent Wallace, who helped police in the search, told Hudson Valley’s YNN: ‘We were startled to find a woodchuck at the base of the tombstone with an empty flag pole in front of him.’

Patriotism: People first noticed the flags were disappearing preceding Fourth of July celebrations

The caretaker said that the evidence had always been against human vandals, pointing out that the flags were pulled downward rather than being ripped out.

The flag thefts were discovered in the days leading up to Independence Day. As flags were put around the graves, they would again disappear, baffling and angering those involved.

But police did not rule out a more sinister explanation. Police chief Ellis Richardson told KLTV that he had never seen anything like this in his 27 years of service, adding: ‘Typically, the assumption is juveniles or kids partying might be responsible for this type of incident.’

It is unclear what Cedar Park or the town plans to do with the cemetery’s living residents, though it is clear that 

Chief
Richardson said there wasn’t much of a choice fighting the pests. ‘I’m 
not sure how you can go up against Mother Nature, I think you’ll have to
start plugging up the holes,’ he suggested.
