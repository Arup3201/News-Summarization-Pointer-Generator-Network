Two British lorry drivers have been arrested in Italy after £16million worth of heroin concealed between boxes of breadsticks was discovered in the back of a lorry bound for Lancashire.

The drivers were stopped by police as they arrived at the Adriatic port of Bari, southern Italy, from Greece, it was reported.

The drugs were discovered in the back of a lorry during a routine check by customs officers and members of the Guardia di Finanza.
