A 25-year-old man used a traditional method of bleaching and printing to produce more than $1million in counterfeit money, authorities say.

Vincent Gerome Rome Jr, of Atlanta, Georgia, allegedly turned $5 notes into $100 notes over a two-year period and then sold on the fake money.

He bleached the $5 bills with solvents and cleaners, before putting the white-washed paper through a printing press to stamp $100 on the notes.

U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that Rome made a ‘staggering amount’ despite his ‘old-fashioned method’.

Rome was allegedly selling on the money to other people in Atlanta who would put the bills into circulation across south-eastern U.S. states.

Authorities searched his home three months ago and said they found several trays, with one filled with $5 bills left to soak in a degreaser.

They also discovered thousands of $100 bills, a number of printers and three firearms, reported the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

He is expected to be sentenced in February, but the FBI is continuing with its investigation in the meantime, reported the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

The U.S. Secret Service provides guidelines on how to detect counterfeit money, including studying the note's portrait to determine how lifelike it seems.

The department also advises looking closely at the Federal Reserve and Treasury seals, borders, serial numbers and the type of paper used.
