Up to 160 applicants are chasing each graduate vacancy at some of the country’s top companies, research published today shows.

Britain’s leading graduate employers have received an average of 46 applications per post this year - up from 35 in 2008 amid ‘fierce’ competition.

However, marketing and sales jobs at firms such as Unilever and Procter & Gamble have seen 160 applications per graduate job advertised.

The number of applicants per graduate post job in the media stands at 110; banking and finance, 84; oil and energy, 74; retailing, 64; public sector 49 and investment banking, 48.

The new study comes as Higher Education Statistics Agency figures showed last week that more than 20,000 graduates - nine per cent - were unemployed six months after leaving university last year.

There was also a doubling in the number of university-leavers taking menial jobs such as shelf stackers, garbage collectors and cleaners over the last six years, as thousands failed to land graduate jobs.

Fierce competition: The new study found that more than 20,000 graduates were unemployed six months after leaving university last year

High Fliers Research surveyed 100 top graduate employers including Marks & Spencer, PwC, Rolls-Royce, Saatchi and Saatchi and Ernst & Young.

Overall, vacancies for graduate jobs starting this September rose by 4.6 per cent from 16,452 in 2012 to 17,217, taking graduate recruitment to its highest level since 2008.

However, a third of recruiters reduced their entry-level vacancies this year, with six cutting more than 50 graduate positions.

And within nine out of 13 sectors including media and banking, graduate vacancies are lower than before the start of the recession.

This year, there were a third fewer entry-level positions at the City investment banks compared with 2007 and recruitment at the major oil and energy companies was 25 per cent lower.

The worst-hit sector is the media where there are currently half the number of graduate jobs than before the economic downturn.

The survey also found that three-quarters of graduate employers require applicants to have at least a 2.1 degree and a quarter specify that candidates should have a minimum Ucas tariff, based on their A-level results.

More than four-fifths use some form of aptitude test such as verbal or abstract reasoning. Over a third conduct skills-based or strength-based assessments.

Rude awakening: Many graduates went travelling at the start of the recession but have come back to find the job market even more competitive

The average graduate starting salary is £29,000 - the same rate paid over the last three years.Martin Birchall, managing director of High Fliers Research, said: ‘This cohort and last year are by far the most motivated graduate job hunters we’ve ever seen.

‘At the start of the recession, the reaction from many students was to avoid the job market so they went off travelling or signed up for more postgraduate studying. The realisation now is that there’s a good number of top graduate jobs available but you have to fight for them.

‘Students have been making more applications and they’ve started their job hunting earlier. On average, students apply for a minimum of seven companies and some are applying for between 20 and 50.’

HESA statistics published last week showed that 9,695 graduates - six per cent of those finding employment - took up ‘elementary occupations’ that did not require degrees after leaving university in 2011/12.

This included working as bar staff, waiters and waitresses, hotel porters, couriers, mail sorters and window cleaners.

This compared to the 5,460 or four cent of students who ended up in these menial jobs six months after graduating in 2006/7.
