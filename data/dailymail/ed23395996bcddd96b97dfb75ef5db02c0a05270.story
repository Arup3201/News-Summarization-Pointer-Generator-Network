Near-simultaneous bomb blasts in several Iraqi cities killed 49 people and left 198 injured earlier today, on the ninth anniversary of the U.S.- led invasion of the country.

The violence comes just days before Baghdad hosts a landmark Arab summit and are the deadliest to hit Iraq in nearly a month.

The Iraqi wing of al Qaida said it was behind at least one of the attacks near Baghdad's heavily guarded Green Zone.

Blast: Today Iraqi security forces were seen inspecting the site of a bomb attack in Hilla, 100 km south of Baghdad, which killed two people and injured more than 20 others

A statement on a militant website 
said the group targeted the office that will oversee security for the 
upcoming Arab League summit - the first time the meeting is set to be 
held in Baghdad for more than a generation.

In the capital, a car bomb exploded 
in a car park opposite the foreign ministry, according to security and 
medical officials - despite high security in preparation for the March 
27-29 Arab League summit.

The deadliest strike hit the holy Shiite city of Karbala, where officials said two car bombs exploded in a crowded shopping and restaurant area.

Thirteen people were killed and another 50 injured, said local provincial council member Hussein Shadhan al-Aboudi.

Karbala, 50 miles (80km) south of Baghdad, is a destination for thousands of Shiite pilgrims from around the world who visit the golden shrines of two revered imams each day.

Mr al-Aboudi immediately blamed the attacks on al-Qaeda, the terror network which officials believe is behind the recent violence with the aim of forcing the Arab League's summit in Baghdad next week to be cancelled for the second year in a row.

It will be the first meeting of the 22-nation body to be held in the capital since Saddam's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

'The intention of these attacks is to destabilise the security situation in Karbala and other Iraqi cities and to shake the people's confidence on the government,' Mr al-Aboudi said.

'It seems that the terrorists want to abort the upcoming Arab Summit in Baghdad,' he added.

'The message is directed to the Arab leaders that Iraq is not safe enough to be visited.'

Attacks today in five other cities - Baghdad, the northern city of Kirkuk and three southern towns - largely appeared to target police forces.

Three policemen were among those killed as bombings struck at security patrols in Baghdad and the town of Latifiyah, about 20 miles (30km) south of the Iraqi capital, local officials said.

A car bomb also exploded outside a police headquarters in Kirkuk, 180 miles (290km) north of Baghdad, said Brigadier General Sarhad Qadir.

A car bomb outside a restaurant of Hillah, about 60 miles (95km) south of Baghdad, killed two people and injured more than 20 others.

And a roadside bomb exploded in a commercial area in Mahmoudiya, about 20 miles (30km) south of Baghdad, killing two and wounding seven.

Officials have been braced for attacks in the run-up to the annual Arab League summit in Baghdad, where the government hopes to showcase Iraq's improved security and stability since the sectarian fighting a few years ago that almost pulled the country into civil war.

The summit was initially supposed to be held last year but was postponed in part because of concerns about Iraq's security.

Insurgents are seeking to belie Baghdad's better image, and officials expect more attacks as hundreds of dignitaries and journalists converge on the capital next week.
