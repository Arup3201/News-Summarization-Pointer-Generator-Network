British boxer Amir Khan has visited the school in northwestern Pakistan where Taliban militants massacred 132 children.

Khan went to the school in Peshawar on Monday as part of a visit to the country to pay his respects to those who died in the attack on December 16 and help encourage children who were scared to return to school.

Khan, who was born in Britain but is of Pakistani origin, travelled there last week.

He has also donated the £30,000 shorts he wore against Devon Alexander in order to help raise money to repair the Army School.

In a press conference last week in Islamabad, held shortly after he landed in Pakistan, the boxer said it was 'more important than ever' to travel to the region.

'Talking about this stuff could be threatening for me, but I just want to speak the truth and tell people what is happening is wrong,' he said.

'I think it's more important now than ever to go over there. I think it will send a statement to a lot of people that Amir Khan is going there to make a difference.

'I want it to be a better country. It's just a shame - I cannot believe how sick some people are.'

Taliban gunmen stormed the military-run school and killed 148 people, including 132 children.

During his trip, Khan announced that he would be building a boxing academy in the eastern city of Lahore.
