Queen Maria of Yugoslavia has been exhumed and will be sent to her home after 70 years of exile

She was exiled from her country during World War II by the Nazis, but now the body of Queen Maria of Yugoslavia is finally being allowed to return home.

The monarch, who is second cousin once removed of both Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, will return to Serbia after being exhumed from the Royal burial ground at Frogmore, Windsor.

Queen Maria’s husband King Alexander I was assassinated a Bulgarian terrorist in 1934 as he drove through Marseilles, France.

The couple’s 11-year-old son, King Peter II, inherited the throne, but the family forced to leave in 1941 after Yugoslavia was invaded.

She lived in Britain until her death in 1961, but the Communist leader who ruled the country from 1945, Marshal Josip Tito, refused to allow her body to be returned.

The Sunday Telegraph reported that with permission from Queen Elizabeth II, the Serbian royal family has arranged for Queen Maria’s remains to return to her home country.

A spokesman said: ‘This is very emotional for us. This is a huge moment for modern Serbia.’

Her body was exhumed on Friday and relocated to a Serbian orthodox church in London the next day.

A Holy Liturgy and Memorial Service for Queen Maria was  officiated at the Serbian Orthodox Church of St Sava in London today in front of living members of the Serbian royal family.

Her grandson, the Crown Prince Alexander, will fly to Belgrade with her body following the memorial service today.

Queen Maria was known as a very modern woman, driving cars and becoming a noted philanthropist

Her last resting place will be the royal mausoleum in Topola, 80 miles from the capital.

The Serbian royal family spokesman added: ‘She was the first woman to drive a car in that part of Europe. She spoke five languages, she was very stylish, she was a great painter and a philanthropist.

‘She was loved by so many.’
