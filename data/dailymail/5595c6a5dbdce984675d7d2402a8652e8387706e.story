'Erratic': Steven Brooks is set to become the first Nevada Assemblyman to be expelled in 150 years 

A Nevada politician is set to become the first assemblyman to be expelled from the state's legislature in 150 years after being arrested for violent disturbances twice in two months.

Steven Brooks's 'increasingly erratic' behaviour began in January when he was arrested after allegedly making threats toward colleagues. According to police he had a gun in his car and dozens of rounds of ammunition.

He was arrested a second time  in February after a domestic disturbance at his estranged wife's home in which police say he threw punches and tried to grab a officer's gun.

Now a bipartisan Nevada legislative panel has recommended his expulsion after voting 6-1 in favour.

The expulsion requires a two-thirds majority vote of the Assembly, though Assembly Majority Leader William Horne gave no indication when the full chamber might take up the matter.

The seven-member panel was tasked with recommending what action should be taken against Brooks.

Since January, the 41-year-old Democrat from North Las Vegas has been arrested twice, hospitalized for a mental evaluation and placed on leave from the Legislature.

The last time the Assembly considered kicking out a sitting member was in 1867, but it never came to a final floor vote.

Brooks' attorney, Mitchell Posin, said the vote was 'disappointing, of course. I hope when the Assembly meets to consider this, they see another side of this as Ms. Neal did.'

He was referring to Assemblywoman Dina Neal, the North Las Vegas Democrat who cast the lone dissenting vote. She said she preferred suspending Brooks.

'I was at a crossroads and I know Steven Brooks needs help,' she said.

Horne reiterated the difficulty of the panel's job and said it had been 'difficult watching these events the last few months.'

'I believe, as others, that Steven - Mr. Brooks - is not ready, not capable of serving in this body,' Horne said.

'I haven't seen and I was hoping to see something that would lead me to see something to think he may be able to. I really hope he does seek that help.'

The committee met for three hours 
behind closed doors to consider Brooks' behavior and medical issues. 
Horne said that while he preferred open meetings, 'there is a point at 
which we must protect privacy.'

He added that Brooks already has been 
the subject of intense media attention and that it was not the panel's 
intention to 'harm or further embarrass Mr. Brooks.'

Mark Ferrario, the panel's independent
 counsel, said the private documents include health records and other 
information obtained from state agencies under the condition of 
confidentiality.

Posin sat alone in the courtroom that 
was set up for the hearing. He did not explain why Brooks was not 
present, but agreed with the decision to close the meeting to the 
public.

'It is appropriate to have some 
matters in public but there are also some very private documents here 
that do not belong in the public eye,' Posin said.

Brooks, a two-term Democrat from North Las Vegas, won re-election by a 2-to-1 margin in November over an unknown challenger.

Since January, his behavior became 
increasingly erratic and spiraled downward.

In addition to the two arrests he was hospitalized after police were 
called to his grandmother's home for a domestic disturbance, posed 
shirtless for a newspaper photograph, was sworn in to the Legislature 
but then banished from the Legislature building as a possible security 
risk.

Brooks hasn't been charged with a 
crime in the threat case, but faces one felony and three lesser charges 
in the case involving the police officer.

He also was denied the purchase of a gun last month at a Sparks sporting goods store.

Posin said before the hearing that Brooks poses no real threat to anyone.

The Assembly last initiated the 
expulsion of a member accused of libeling other lawmakers in 1867 but 
never took a formal vote.

Back then, Assemblyman A.H. Lissak, of Storey 
County, had published a letter referring to the Assembly speaker's 
'sore-eyed, red-haired, baboon-looking face' in a political feud that 
prompted a ban on Territorial Enterprise reporters from the chambers.

An ouster requires a two-thirds majority, or 28 votes in the 42-member Assembly.

Brooks' lawyer has already filed 
papers with the Nevada Supreme Court to challenge legislative action to 
prevent Brooks from serving voters who elected him.

Posin argues the Legislature is taking unconstitutional steps to block Brooks' right and duty to serve his constituents.
