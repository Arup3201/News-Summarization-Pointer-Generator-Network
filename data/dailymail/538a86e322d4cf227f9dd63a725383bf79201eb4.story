Rodents: Mutant 'super rats' are plaguing the upmarket town of Henley-on-Thames

With its pretty riverside location and the annual Royal Regatta, Henley-on-Thames has never had much trouble attracting visitors.

But the latest ones won’t be welcome – the upmarket town in South Oxfordshire has been invaded by a plague of mutant ‘super-rats’.

Carrying a poison-resistant gene, they have been found by researchers on farms and other properties around Henley after previously being identified in parts of Berkshire and Hampshire.

The brown rats look the same as  their non-mutant counterparts and, like them, can carry life-threatening diseases, but are resistant to typical pest controls thanks to genetic mutation.

Dr Alan Buckle, a research fellow at the University of Reading who carried out the study that found the rats in Henley, said: ‘Rats carry a vast range of diseases, including Weil’s disease.

‘These diseases are very harmful and potentially fatal to both humans and animals.’ Weil’s disease is a water-borne bacterial infection linked to the urine of infected rats. It killed Olympic rowing champion Andy Holmes in 2010.

Dr Buckle used new DNA techniques to determine the prevalence of rats with the poison-resistant gene. As well as areas around Henley, they were found in Berkshire near Caversham and Sonning.

‘For 30 years we have been using the same two poisons,’ Dr Buckle said. ‘This has meant that the susceptible rats died and the resistant ones lived and bred.

‘We are now in a situation where the rat poison which pest controllers are legally allowed to use is ineffective, meaning it is becoming harder to control rats.’

The Health and Safety Executive is 
evaluating whether new poisons should be approved to control rats. 
However, many animal welfare groups believe that this is not the answer 
as poisons, or rodenticides, can be detrimental to wildlife.

Jeff Knott, of the RSPB, said: ‘The 
risk to wildlife by the use of rodenticides is very real, particularly 
to animals which eat rats such as birds of prey and barn owls.

‘Rat control is necessary but the RSPB does not believe that the answer is the licensing of more and more toxic poisons.

‘The more poisons we use, the more 
resistant rats will become to them. The answer is firstly prevention and
 then other control methods such as trapping and shooting.’

But Richard Moseley, a technical 
manager with the British Pest Control Association, said: ‘Tons and tons 
of poison are being used to little effect.

‘In terms of the threat to wildlife, 
it would be a lot better if new poisons which actually work could be 
used as a much smaller amount of them would be needed.

‘Rats are very intelligent and would soon become behaviourally resistant to traps.’

Dr Buckle, whose survey was funded by 
nine organisations involved in pest control, said: ‘My view is that we 
need to use the stronger poisons but we need to tell people how to use 
them carefully. If we can do that we can solve the problem.’

There are thought to be 10.5million 
rats in the country. In areas where resistance exists around  70 per 
cent carry the rodenticide- resistant gene.
