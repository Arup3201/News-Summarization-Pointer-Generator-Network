Apple has announced a global programme to replace all third-party and counterfeit USB power adaptors.

The move comes after a Chinese woman was reportedly electrocuted while using a non-Apple charger.

The technology giant has said consumers can buy an authentic USB adaptor for the equivalent of $10 (£6.51).

Apple chargers normally cost around £15 in the UK.

Ma Ailun, 23, collapsed and died in China last month after answering her iPhone while it was charging.

Apple did not specifically refer to this incident as it launched the charger replacement programme, but said: 'Recent reports have suggested that some counterfeit and third-party adaptors may not be designed properly and could result in safety issues.

'While not all third party adaptors have an issue, we are announcing a USB Power Adaptor Takeback Programme to enable customers to acquire properly designed adaptors.

'Customer safety is a top priority at Apple.'

The Apple initiative will take place from August 16 to October 18. Anyone who wants to take up the offer will have to provide the serial number of their iPhone, iPad or iPod, and hand over a USB charger

Phil Buckle, director general of the Electrical Safety Council, also warned about the dangers of cheap USB chargers.

'Whilst everyone loves a bargain, if a cheap electrical product turns out to be fake then it is, at best, a waste of money. At worst, it could result in the death of a loved one,' he said.

More than four million counterfeit goods were seized coming into the UK last year and one of the top fakes was phone chargers.

'This is worrying as faulty electrical goods are a leading cause of severe electric shock in the UK and cause thousands of house fires each year,' said Buckle.

'Counterfeit electrical goods almost always contain incorrect or faulty parts that can overheat or break just days after purchase.

'If the price is too good to be true, it probably is.'

The Apple initiative will take place at stores and participating authorised service providers from August 16 to October 18.

Anyone who wants to take up the offer will have to provide the serial number of their iPhone, iPad or iPod, and hand over a USB charger.

The reduced price Apple chargers will be limited to one per Apple device.

Last month Apple in China posted instructions on how to tell an official power adapter from a fake one.

It provided images (shown below) of chargers for each Apple device,
 including the iPhone 5 and the iPad 2, with the safety notices 
underneath.

The site reads: 'This overview will help you identify genuine Apple USB power adapter.
    
'When you need to charge the iPhone or iPad, we recommend that you use the standard USB power adapter and USB cable.'
    
All iPhone and iPads are sold with official Apple chargers, although fake replacements can be bought online.
