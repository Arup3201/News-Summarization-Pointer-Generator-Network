Antonio Nocerino will not return to West Ham ahead of the new season after joining Torino on loan from AC Milan.

The 29-year-old midfielder made 10 appearances for the Hammers during a four-month loan spell at Upton Park but will be playing his football in Turin when the 2014-15 Serie A campaign begins.

Barclays Premier League outfit West Ham had reportedly been interested in re-signing the 15-time Italy international.

A statement published on Torino's official website on Wednesday announced that the club were 'proud' to have secured Nocerino's services from Milan on a temporary basis.

The Granata finished seventh in Serie A last season and could enter the preliminary stages of the Europa League should sixth-placed Parma's appeal against a decision to deny them a UEFA licence be rejected.
