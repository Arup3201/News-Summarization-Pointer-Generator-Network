With their washboard abs, toned legs and defined arms, Nicole Scherzinger and Suki Waterhouse possess bodies that most of us wouldn't mind having.

Now FEMAIL can reveal exactly how Nicole and Suki achieve their honed physiques - and it takes hard work, intense training sessions and a lot of willpower to look this good.

The singer and model are both huge fans of the Viking Method, an intense training programme based on the lifestyle of the Icelandic people that promises to teach you how to 'train like professionals, eat like nutritionists and sleep like babies.'

'Icelandic men have won the world's strongest man competition more often than any other nation and the Icelandic women are considered to be one of the most beautiful women in the world,' says founder Svava Sigbertsdottir, who just so happens to be from Iceland.

'Surviving centuries of isolation, cold, enormous volcanic eruptions and hardship, the Icelanders carry within their genes the toughness to endure anything they are faced with. 

'The harder the work, the more they get out of it. And this is shown in their mentality when it comes to fitness. Indoor mixed with outdoor training. Even in the snow. We push ourselves and never give up.'

The programme trains clients based on this philosophy and shocks the body's metabolism into burning fat with interval and different HIT (high-intensity training) techniques such as kick-boxing, crawling and leap frogs.

Brains behind the brand: Svava Sigbertsdottir, 33, created the method based on her hometown of Iceland, where, she says, they push themselves to their limits and even train in the snow

'I teach my clients to use their bodies as much as they can. These methods utilise oxygen and energy for fat burning,' said 33-year-old Svava, who moved to London ten years ago to undertake a dance degree.

It is designed to strip fat, increase performance, agility, power, speed and create a long, lean athletic physique - as showcased by Nicole and Suki.

When Nicole was in the UK for X Factor, Svava trained her three to four times a week and sees Suki three times a week.

Svava offers a £200 online nine-week intense training programme - perfect for getting in shape for a holiday - or an online training portal for £120 a month.

Speaking about the regime, Nicole said: 
'I love Svava’s technique. With me, she does a combination of her 
functional training, martial arts and ballet isolation exercises. In all
 my years of training, the Viking Method is unlike anything I have ever 
done.'

Speaking about 21-year-old model Suki, Svava said: 'My regime is perfect for Suki because she is cool with falling on the grass and getting mud on her face.'

Speaking about the diet aspect of her regime, which she tailors to each individual clients, Svava added: 'It is drinking loads of water. It is eating the good protein, the healthy fat and fibre. It is eating buckets of fresh vegetables and fruit.

'It's all about your hormones and balancing your insulin levels. Optimum hormonal balance is crucial for a healthy person and for weight loss.

Keeping them in shape: When Nicole, left, was in the UK for X Factor, Svava trained her three to four times a week and sees Suki three times a week

'We all have six fat-burning hormones and three fat-storing hormones. If any of the fat-storing hormones are activated, none of the fat-burning hormones will work. So if you eat certain things at certain times of the day or close to training, you cannot burn fat.

'My method's diet is all about blocking the fat-storing and activating the fat-burning hormones and keeping the body working at a perfect state.

'Most of all, it is about feeling good. I help create a body that's more like a fantastic machine.'

Hard work: Svava teaches her clients to use their body as much as they can. These methods, such as pushing your partner along the floor on a towel, utilise oxygen and energy for fat burning

Good friends: Nicole has become close with Svava, who trained her as many as four times per week while she was filming for X Factor
