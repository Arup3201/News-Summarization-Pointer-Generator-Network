A thick layer of dust blanketed Baghdad today as one of the heaviest sandstorms in years hit the city a day before it is due to host global talks with Iran about nuclear weapons.

The sky turned an ominous orange as sand from the surrounding desert blew into the Iraqi capital and caused mayhem.

The international airport was closed, businesses were forced to shut and hundreds of residents – particularly those with asthma - went to hospital with breathing difficulties due to the choking air.

The spring storm also appeared to hamper military flights.

None of the helicopter patrols that regularly roar over the city of six million people seemed to be airborne.

Sandstorms usually occur about twice a year in Baghdad, which is shielded from the desert by a thin strip of arable land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.

But this latest one comes as a very unfortunate time as Iran and six world powers are due to meet in the city tomorrow for negotiations over Iran's nuclear intentions. The storm means envoys may struggle to reach the Iraqi capital.

The U.S., Britain, Russia, China, France and Germany hope the talks will result in an agreement by Tehran to stop enriching uranium to a higher level that could be turned quickly into the fissile core of nuclear arms.

Failure will strengthen calls for military action following the almost decade-long effort to persuade Iran to stop its programme.

But hours before the talks are due to begin, the United Nations nuclear chief today said a tentative deal has been reached with the Islamic republic.

Tehran will allow the UN nuclear agency to restart a long-stalled probe into suspicions that Tehran has secretly worked on developing nuclear arms.

By compromising on the International Atomic Energy Agency probe, Iranian negotiators in Baghdad could argue that the onus is on the other side to show some flexibility and temper its demands.

Although IAEA chief Yukiya Amano Amano's trip and the talks in Baghdad are formally separate, Iran hopes progress can boost its chances in pressing the U.S. and Europe to roll back sanctions that have hit Iran's critical oil exports and blacklisted the country from international banking networks.

It is unclear how far the results achieved by Mr Amano would serve that purpose, with his trip failing to seal a conclusive deal, despite his upbeat comments.

After talks in Tehran with chief Iranian nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, Mr Amano said: ‘The decision was made ... to reach agreement on the mechanics of giving the IAEA access to sites, scientists and documents it seeks to restart its probe.’

Mr Amano speaking to reporters on his return to Vienna airport after his one-day trip to Tehran, said differences existed on ‘some details’, without elaborating, but added that Mr Jalili had assured him that these ‘will not be an obstacle to reach agreement’.

He spoke of ‘an almost clean text’ that will be signed soon, although he could not say when.

For the six powers, a main concern is Iran's production of uranium enriched to 20 per cent, which is far higher than needed for regular energy-producing reactors but used for one Iran says it needs for medical research.

The U.S. and its allies fear the higher-enriched uranium could be quickly boosted to warhead-grade material.

American officials have said Washington will not backpedal from its stance that Iran must fully halt uranium enrichment.

But speculation is increasing that the priorities have shifted to block the 20 per cent enrichment and perhaps allow Iran to maintain lower-level nuclear fuel production - at least for now.
