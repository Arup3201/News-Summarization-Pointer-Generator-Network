Fabio Borini is happy at Liverpool and wants to try and force his way into Brendan Rodgers' thinking this season, according to the player's agent.

The Italian turned down moves to Sunderland, where he spent the previous season on loan, and QPR in the summer despite being told his first-team chances with the Reds would be limited.

Borini has made just one start and two substitute appearances, one of which came in the Champions League against Ludogorets, but his agent Marco de Marchi said there were no plans to look at moving him on.

'At this moment I am certainly not going to look for another club, as the boy is happy to remain at Liverpool,' he said.

'Let's not forget he left a journey he already started at Roma in order to come to England.

'He has managed to find some space playing in the Champions League and starting in the Premier League. Things are progressing as expected.'

Borini continues to be linked with other clubs, including a number back in his homeland, but De Marchi stressed there was nothing in the pipeline.

'Borini is a top-level player, so consequently he has a contract with Liverpool and any club interested knows how to approach them,' he told FcInterNews.it.

'Liverpool have no intention of loaning him out, as they already proved in August.

'We know that and so do all the clubs who came looking for him in the last transfer session.

'The situation is exactly the same as it was in September, in the sense that he is very happy to be part of this important team.'
