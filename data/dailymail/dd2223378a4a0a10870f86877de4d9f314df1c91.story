Kyle Denton, 27, tried to claim that he had injured his finger falling down a pothole but had actually injured it after he punched someone

A thug broke his finger punching a man then tried to win compensation from his local council telling them he injured it falling down a pothole.  

Kyle Denton's story fell apart when it emerged he had posted a picture of his finger on Facebook and boasted that he damaged it 'cracking someone'. 

Officials from Wakefield Council, West Yorkshire, traced the victim of the assault who confirmed he had been hit by Denton.

The 27-year-old even met with staff to show them the spot where he had allegedly fallen. 

Wakefield Magistrates Court heard how Denton’s account became suspicious following the meeting about the authenticity of the claim. 

Angus MacDonald, prosecuting, said: 'Rather than injuring it in a fall, he had sustained it assaulting a man.

'The defendant stated on the [conversation] thread that it had happened "cracking someone".'

Denton, of Lupset, West Yorkshire, who had submitted a personal injury claim in November 2012, dropped the allegation and his solicitor stated he would no longer be taking action against the council.

Mr MacDonald added: 'No payment was made. The claim was at such an early stage. It’s only through the vigilance of the council and their employees that the suspicious nature of this came to light.'

Magistrate Julian Garthwaite told Denton, who admitted fraud: 'You falsely claimed and stuck with that line you had fallen down a pothole to get money from the council.

'You now at the 11th hour have pleaded guilty and said that was incorrect and a bundle of lies.'

Denton was sentenced to 100 hours of unpaid community work. He must pay £250 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

Cllr Graham Stokes, Cabinet Member for Corporate Performance for Wakefield Council, said: 'We are pleased with the outcome of this case as fraudulent claims can cost the Council valuable time and money in already very challenging financial times.

'False claims will not be tolerated and our insurers and claim handlers are well trained to ensure that public money is not wasted in this way.' 

Denton posted the picture of his damaged finger, which can be seen with pins in it, on his Facebook page
