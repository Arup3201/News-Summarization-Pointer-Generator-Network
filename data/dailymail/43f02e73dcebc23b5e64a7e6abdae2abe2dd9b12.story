Neil Armstrong's wife and granddaughter were joined by hundreds of mourners who gathered to pay tribute to Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, at his funeral today.

He was honoured as a humble hero who saw himself as a team player and never capitalized on his celebrity.

The private service at the Camargo Club in Cincinnati was attended by fellow space pioneers, including his two crew mates on the historic Apollo 11 mission, Buzz Edwin Aldrin and Michael Collins.

One of Armstrong's 10 grandchildren, Piper Van Wagenen, was among the family and friends to give heartfelt readings in his memory.

A memorial service has been scheduled 
for September 12 in Washington, although no other details have been 
released on the service or burial plans for Armstrong who died on 
Saturday at the age of 82. He suffered complications resulting from 
cardiovascular procedure.

'You'll
never get a hero, in my view, like Neil Armstrong,' said Apollo 8 
astronaut Bill Anders, who praised Armstrong after the service for his 
wisdom and humility in the way he handled becoming a global icon. 'It's 
going to be hard to top.'

'America has truly lost a legend,' said Eugene Cernan, an Apollo astronaut who is the last man to have walked on the moon.

Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, eulogized Armstrong "as a reluctant hero" and said afterward the service was a mix of emotion and humor, with Armstrong's two sons talking about him as a father and grandfather.

'He touched the lives of so many,' Portman said.

'He
was the embodiment of everything this nation is all about,' said NASA 
Administrator Charles Bolden. Armstrong, he said, had a courageous drive
for exploration while being an 'incredibly humble' man who probably 
wouldn't have wanted all the attention of Friday's service.

It included a Navy ceremonial guard, a bagpiper corps and songs including 'When the Saints Go Marching In.' Four Navy fighter planes flew over at the end of the service, one flying upward in tribute to Armstrong, a former Navy pilot who flew combat missions in Korea.

Raised in Wapakoneta, Ohio, Armstrong developed an early love for aviation.

He commanded the Gemini 8 mission in 
1966 and Apollo 11's historic moon landing on July 20, 1969. As a 
worldwide audience watched on TV, Armstrong took the step on the lunar 
surface he called 'one giant leap for mankind.'

Juri
Taalman, 78, said he made a special trip from Hartford, Connecticut, 
just to stand across the road from the club where the service was held, 
in tribute to Armstrong.

He
said he and his wife were on their honeymoon in Amsterdam the day of 
the moon landing. He recalled hotel employees bringing champagne to the 
guests watching Armstrong's first steps together on television, and an 
Englishman lifting his glass in a toast 'to all mankind!'

Taalman's voice cracked as he discussed his visit on Friday.

'I just think a really great man has passed, and the world is poorer for it,' he said.

Earlier
Friday, Cernan and Apollo 13 commander James Lovell spoke at a 
Cincinnati hospital to help launch a children's health fund in 
Armstrong's memory.

Cernan 
and Lovell recounted visiting U.S troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with 
Armstrong, saying he always had an inspirational impact when meeting 
troops, schoolchildren and other admirers around the world.

Lovell said Armstrong was 'a great American' who never capitalized on his celebrity and just 'wanted to be a team player.' 

While Armstrong had said any of the 
astronauts could have been the first to walk on the moon, Lovell and 
Cernan said Armstrong was the right choice because of the way he handled
suddenly becoming an icon.

'There's
nobody that I know of that could have accepted the challenge and 
responsibility that came with being that with more dignity than Neil 
Armstrong,' Cernan said.

Lovell
and Cernan said that they had visited Armstrong two months ago in his 
home in suburban Indian Hill, and that he cooked breakfast for them - 
and burned the eggs.

Tribute: Armstrong was praised as a 'hero' and a 'legend'

One small step... Neil Armstrong was the mission commander of the Apollo 11 moon landing mission on July 20, 1969 and the first person to set foot on the moon.

'Neil Armstrong was probably one of the most human guys I've ever known in my life,' Cernan said.

In a statement NASA Administrator Charles Bolden called Armstrong 'a pioneering American, an explorer, a patriot and an individual who, with "one small step", achieved an impossible dream.'

'His remarkable achievements will be forever remembered, and his grace and 
humility will always be admired,' he continued.

'As we take the next giant leap forward in human exploration 
of our vast universe, we stand on the shoulders of this brave, reluctant hero.

'Neil Armstrong's first step 
on the moon paved the way for others to be the "first" to step foot on 
another planet. We have an obligation to carry on this 
uniquely American legacy.

'A grateful nation offers praise and salutes a humble servant who answered 
the call and dared to dream.'

Armstrong's family has suggested memorial contributions to two scholarship funds in his name or to the Neil Armstrong New Frontiers Initiative at Cincinnati Children's. His wife, Carol, is on the hospital's board.

The astronauts were joined there 
Friday by 14-year-old Shane DiGiovanna, an aspiring aerospace engineer 
with a rare skin tissue disease. He is able to hear after a cochlear 
implant, with a device developed by a NASA scientist.

Before
the announcement, Shane, who said Armstrong has always inspired him, 
quizzed the two astronauts about details of their missions. Lovell 
recounted the streams of oxygen that wrapped the Apollo 13 spacecraft 
'like a cocoon' after an oxygen tank explosion.

The harrowing Apollo 13 flight was recounted in his book and depicted in the popular movie, in which Tom Hanks played Lovell.

After his space career, Armstrong returned to Ohio, teaching aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati and generally avoiding public view for most of the rest of his life.

Armstrong married Carol Knight in 1999. He had two sons from a previous marriage.

In announcing his death, Armstrong's family requested that when people 'see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink.'
