A huge Wild West-style brawl involving more than 20 people broke out at a pub after a family feud spilled over into violence.

A dozen police officers had to be called to break up the fight at the Railway Inn in Newton Abbot, Devon, which was described by the landlord as 'the worst I have ever seen'.

During the melee one woman in her 20s had to be rushed to hospital after being knocked unconscious, while another aged 42 was arrested.

A huge fight involving more than 20 people broke out at this pub in Newton Abbott, Devon, after a family fuel turned violent according to a pub spokesman

Officers and paramedics were called to the pub, which is described online as having a 'Wild West saloon feel', at around 10.45pm last Friday.

A 42-year-old, from Newton Abbot, was arrested on suspicion of assault after another woman in her 20s fell to the floor and was knocked out.

The victim, also from Newton Abbot, was taken to hospital to be treated while the suspect was released from police custody without being charged.

A pub spokesman said: This was a family feud. Such behaviour at pub premises won’t be tolerated.

'It’s the worst I’ve seen in the years I’ve been here. We condemn what happened.'

Inspector Dave Hammond, based at Newton Abbot, said: 'The town is generally a very safe place to go out for the evening.

'Our officers work very hard to make sure people can go out, enjoy themselves, and feel safe.

'It was an unusual incident for us to deal with as we would not normally expect to attend these premises.'
