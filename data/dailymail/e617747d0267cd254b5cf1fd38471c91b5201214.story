Leaping from a 4,500ft high cliff and plummeting through the air at 120mph wouldn't be everyone's idea of fun, but for these thrillseekers it was an experience of a lifetime.

The daredevils took part in the jump from Mushroom Cliff on the north face of the Eiger in Switzerland as part of a base jumping class.

The stomach-churning sport saw the enthusiasts trek 45 minutes through the Swiss Alps before throwing themselves off the edge.

Skydiving instructor and base jumper, Oliver Furrer, 41 led the class in Switzerland.

The former Swiss Air Force Paratrooper said: 'I run base jumping courses during the spring and autumn, these pictures show some of my students leaping from the Eiger North Face.

'I take my students under my wing, I am their mentor and my job is to show them tricks to enjoy the sport safely and get them out of it alive.

'This was a single canopy jump meaning we jump without a second parachute so you only have one chance for it to go right.

'The location is called Mushroom Cliff is a famous spot for base jumping because of its platform which stands out from the cliff, making it safer as you have less chance of hitting the side of the mountain on the way down.

'The cliff is 4500ft high, you freefall around 2,000ft before releasing your parachute.

'It takes around 40-45 seconds to climb up and then you have 12-13 seconds 'flying' as you freefall before its time to release the parachute.

'The sport is dangerous and there have been fatalities but if you know your limits and are sensible it can be a safe sport.

'It can be dangerous in winter time because of its freezing which has a more physical impact on your body.

'Some people push themselves over the limit and that's when accidents and fatalities happen.

'Some people wait until the last second to release their parachute because they're addicted to the ground rush. But if you open it too late you risk catching the parachute on a tree.

'So the level of danger involved is very much controlled by the person and how they approach the jump.

'The fantastic part of base jumping is the freedom, you can position your body to fly left, right forward. It's amazing when you see the view and then jump into nothing.

'It's an impressive feeling to free fall through the air at 100mph.

'I started base jumping in 1999, I travelled to Florida for a 10 day course. I then learnt how to jump cliffs in Europe.

'This was in the very early days of the sport when it was relatively unheard of but now there are many thousands of people who are addicted to the thrill of this sport.'
