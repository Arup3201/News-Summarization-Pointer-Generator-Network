Steven Gerrard has been a magnificent leader of Liverpool through good times and hard and has striven mightily for England in the teeth of adversity.

In terms of one-clubmanship this exemplary footballer stands just below Sir Tom Finney, the greatest of all English players who devoted his lifetime to Preston.

When his country called, Stevie G never failed to answer with every sinew and fibre of his being.

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has announced he will leave the club when his contract expires this summer

Gerrard has made 695 appearances and scored 180 goals for Liverpool since making his debut in 1998

Premier League: 494 appearances, 116 goals

FA Cup: 39 appearances, 13 goals

League Cup: 28 appearances, 9 goals

Champions League: 87 appearances, 30 goals

UEFA Cup/Europa League: 42 appearances, 11 goals

Other: 5 appearances, 1 goal

TOTAL: 695 appearances, 180 goals

From which I hope you, and he, will gather the esteem in which I hold one of the proudest Merseysiders ever to wear the Anfield red.

Gerrard will head west this summer – not quite into the sunset just yet but as distant as Los Angeles – as a distinguished ambassador for this, the mother country of the world game.

Liverpool will spend the intervening months in celebration of one of their finest, then go into mourning at his departure. As they should.

English football at large will share in the nostalgia. But the placing of Gerrard in the history of our national game is more complicated than this immediate sense of loss.

However moderate the strength of the Liverpool and England teams he has graced, the poignant reality is that he falls tantalisingly just short of the greatest, even in the pantheon of midfield.

The Champions League miracle-worker of Istanbul ought to have delivered more across the spectrum of the domestic game. In part that was because he stayed true to Liverpool while others, his peer Frank Lampard among them, sought fame through transfer.

One-club men are unlikely to harvest as many trophies.

In their honesty – and Gerrard has a heart as big as the Kop - they also end up trying too hard, endeavouring to do too much in the context of their team. As he did at times with England.

The bizarre failure of any England manager to effectively harness Gerrard and Lampard into a midfield partnership potentially powerful enough to lift at least a European Championship was rooted in the end in Stevie G’s reluctance to be confined mostly to the anchor-man role.

That would have been the natural balancing act with Lampard’s more prolific goalscoring but Gerrard always felt he had more to give and at times over-reached himself.

That loss of footing against Chelsea which caused Liverpool to stumble so fatefully on the threshold of last season’s Premier League title should not be held against the captain without whom they would never have got that close.

The most profound loss was his own, condemning him never to win that championship he so richly deserved.

But in a symbolic sense that slip puts into a freeze-frame the reason why he comes no higher than tenth in this list of the greatest English midfielders of all time which, to Liverpool chagrin no doubt, is topped by four of Manchester United’s finest:

1) SIR BOBBY CHARLTON 

World Cup winner extraordinaire and still this country’s leading goalscorer

2) BRYAN ROBSON 

Captain Marvel for both Manchester United and England.

3) DUNCAN EDWARDS 

Rated by Charlton as greater than himself and may well have proved him right but for his premature death among other Busby Babes in the Munich air disaster.

4) PAUL SCHOLES 

The most deft feet to be allied to a computer of a brain in the modern era.

Paul Scholes enjoyed an illustrious career with Manchester United before hanging up his boots in 2013

5) JOHNNY HAYNES 

The sublime passer who invented, with Fulham and England, the diagonal cross-field ball behind the full back and in so doing became this country’s first £100-a-week footballer.

6) PAUL GASCOIGNE 

The genius of this age, albeit ultimately the self-destructor of his own magical talent.

7) WILF MANNION 

The Pied Piper of Middlesbrough who would have won many more trophies with his club and played dozen more games for England had he not spent World War 11 fighting for his country.

8) RAICH CARTER 

The Sunderland ball conjuror who was the darling of the north-east.

9) FRANK LAMPARD 

The engine, the vision but above all more goals than many of the most renowned strikers have mustered.

10) STEVEN GERRARD

See above.
