A great-grandmother who moved into her house the day before the Second World War started is celebrating 75 years living in the three-bedroom property.

Beryl Willson, 79, moved into the semi-detached house in Ipswich, Suffolk, as a four-year-old in 1939.

The classic inter-wars property was built in 1935 - the year Mrs Willson was born - and had been bought by her parents Mason and Maud Garrard for just £375.

Beryl Willson, 79, moved into the semi-detached house in Ipswich, Suffolk, aged four in 1939 and has lived there ever since. Over the years she has raised her two children at the property and had several extensions

The great-grandmother bought the home off her parents for just £2000 in 1961 after marrying her partner John

It has since been handed down to Mrs Willson, who bought it off her parents for £2000 when she married in 1961, and the widow is now celebrating living in the property for several decades.

She said: 'I can't believe I've been here so long.

'It's been a very happy home.

'I call it a home rather than a house because it's looked after so many of us down the years.'

Looking back on sharing an amazing five generations of golden memories, the sprightly mother-of-two added: 'It's been a joyous place, a musical place and people always say they feel calm when they walk through the door.'

Mrs Willson moved into the property with her parents on September 2, 1939 – just 24 hours before Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain declared war on Adolf Hitler's Germany.

Mrs Willson moved into the property on September 2, 1939, and has since raised her own family at the property. She has two children with husband John. Pictured: Mrs Willson as a young mother with daughter Roz

Her father immediately joined the RAF and served in Canada and Palestine before he returned home safe and sound at the end of the six-year conflict in 1945.

'Seeing my dad come back from the war is without doubt one of the happiest memories I've got from all my years here in this home,' she said.

'It was a real time for rejoicing that he'd come back to us.

'We just loved him so much and couldn't believe that he was home for good.'

She also revealed how she was evacuated to Northampton with her mother and younger brother David at the start of the war amid fears of devastating German bombing attacks.

'As dad was being posted to Canada we decided to return to our own home after six months,' she said.

'Our house was never damaged, but we had incendiary bombs dropped in the middle of our road.

'Although it was wartime we always walked to school by ourselves.

'They made it fun down the shelters for us children.

'I can remember the big barrage balloons down Sproughton Road on the Co-op site.

'We watched as two German soldiers came down on parachutes near there and they landed on Bramford Road railway bridge.

'My mum told us not to worry and said if they'd landed in our back garden she'd give them a cup of tea.'

Mrs Willson grew up in her beloved house with brother David, 76, and younger sister Veronica, 66.

The keen church-goer recalled: 'It was much more innocent in those days.

'We children walked to school on our own and neighbours looked out for one another.'

Mother-of-two Mrs Willson (pictured with her daughter Roz) said she likes to call the three-bedroom property a home and not a house because it has looked after so many generations of her family over the last 75 years

The 79-year-old has installed several extensions, including a conservatory, at the property over the years

She married her sweetheart John Willson in 1961, when she was 26, and the newlyweds promptly bought her house from her parents.

The couple went on to bring up their own children there, having a daughter Roz and son Nigel, and have added several extensions including a conservatory to the property.

'Over the years new housing estates have gone up around here and neighbours have come and gone,' she said.

'But we've been so very happy here that we've never wanted to move.

'We've had good neighbours and we found that if we are friendly to people, they are friendly to us.'

She celebrated her golden wedding anniversary with John in October 2011 but he sadly passed away earlier this year.

Mrs Willson added: 'All my children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren come here all the time.

'They all love coming here and I like their company.

'I'd like to think that one of them keeps the house when something happens to me - and that it stays in the family because it really is one of the family.'
