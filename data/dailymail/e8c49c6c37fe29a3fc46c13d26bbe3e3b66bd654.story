David Cameron resurrected Tony Blair's widely-mocked 'Cool Britannia' party - with a glitzy showbiz bash of his own in Whitehall on Monday night.

The Prime Minister invited a host of celebrities to the Foreign Office to celebrate Britain's booming entertainment industry.

The star-studded gathering has invited comparisons with Mr Blair’s 1997 Downing Street reception attended by Noel Gallagher and Vivienne Westwood.

Around 200 guests from across the entertainment industry gathered at the party in the courtyard of the Foreign Office opposite Downing Street.

A selected group of around a dozen guests – thought to include Downton Abbey creator Lord Fellowes and Mr Cameron's close friend Helena Bonham Carter – will then go to Number 10 for dinner.

Strictly Come Dancing hosts Sir Bruce Forsyth, Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman arrived at the party tonight - along with media mogul Harvey Weinstein, TV's Kirstie Allsopp and singer Katherine Jenkins.

Veteran presenters Cilla Black and Ronnie Corbett also turned up at the event.

Hollywood 
star Harrison Ford, 71, was invited but is recovering from an accident 
at Pinewood Studios during filming of the new Star Wars movie which left
 him with a broken leg.

Mr
 Cameron has claimed the event is to champion Britain's success in TV, 
film and music and Downing Street have been at pains to downplay talk of
 a second 'Cool Britannia' party.

Mr Blair's
 1997 party attracted high-flying British celebrities like Oasis 
guitarist Noel Gallagher, but was later seen to backfire on the then PM 
as invited stars later criticised his government.

to be attending a dinner with David Cameron after the event

The
 Government is due to launch its strategy on the creative industries on 
Wednesday, with the aim of boosting a sector which Downing Street says 
is worth billions to the British economy.

The
 number of jobs within these 'creative industries' grew five times 
faster than the national average over the past three years, generating 
more than £70billion a year for the economy.

Ministers
 want to double film and industry exports to £31 billion a year - as 
well as boosting the amount of foreign cash invested in Britain.

The
 Culture Department is also considering scrapping the requirement to 
apply for planning permission for filming, in order to make it easier to
 film outside and construct sets.

The
 drive to increase inward investment was boosted by Warner Bros' 
announcement it will build three new state-of-the-art sound stages at 
its studios at Leavesden, Hertfordshire, where production on a new 
Tarzan film has just begun.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said: 'For years the UK has been at the cutting edge of the creative industries - and we want that to be the case for decades to come.

'This comes back to two things - and the two things that I see being as the most important in my job. One: promoting our culture. Music, film and television help inspire young kids and bring our country together - so I will always back those industries.

'And two: our long-term economic plan. The announcements today, and the reception tonight, are about securing investment, creating new well-paid jobs and opportunities, and helping us build that brighter, better future in our country.'

Warner Bros president Josh Berger said: 'We're delighted to be reinforcing our commitment to the UK creative industries through the expansion of our studios and the announcement that our highly anticipated Tarzan action adventure film will be shooting there.'

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'British talent, services and products are in high demand around the world and our £71billion creative sector is one of the UK's most important industries, employing thousands of people across the country.

'UKTI's new international strategy builds on the UK's global reputation for innovation and quality by setting a goal to double creative exports, double the number of creative companies that trade and establishing the UK as the favoured location for inward investment for the creative industries sector, creating long term jobs and building a stronger economy.'
