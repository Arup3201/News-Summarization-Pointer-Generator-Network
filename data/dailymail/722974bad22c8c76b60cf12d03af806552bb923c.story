Carl Frampton kept his footing on the slipway down which the Titanic slid towards disaster and brought his first world title home to Belfast.

The Jackal’s speed of hand as well as movement overwhelmed Kiko Martinez’s defence of his IBF super-bantamweight title.

Ulster, reconciled behind its new standard bearer for an improved present and a better future, rejoiced.

Down he goes: Martinez was dropped in the fifth round but recovered to take the fight to the final bell

The setting, a pop-up arena for 16,000 in the historic Titanic Quarter, made its own statement about the growing prosperity of a city trying to leave its Troubles behind.

Frampton’s classy exhibition of counter-punch boxing gave him a runaway victory, even though his gallant Spanish opponent kept coming through the pain and punishment to give the fans a fight to keep watching.

Those heroics gave Martinez one round and a share of the last by my 119-109 reckoning.

Two of the judges went one point better at 119-108, while the third gave Martinez a sympathy score of 118-111.

The Jackal could could not deliver the knock-out for which the crowd were baying.

But this performance put the cement in the bricks of reconciliation in Belfast which his manager and mentor, the Irish legend Barry McGuigan, began constructing with his own world title exploits back in the 1980s.

A rich future involving championship unification fights beckons.

Frampton would prefer the first of those to be against English rival Scott Quigg, holder of the ‘regular’ WBA title. As the IBF belt was strapped about him he said: ‘I’ll fight Quigg anywhere. And he needs to remember that I’m the one holding a proper world title.'

A mandatory may intervene early next year but Frampton is close to being the finished article after this, only his 19th fight.

His inability to repeat – or even improve upon – his ninth round stoppage of Martinez here last year suggests he still has to sharpen his killer instinct when he has a top-class fighter in trouble.

The one knock-down he landed should have encouraged him to shed the last vestiges of caution.

But this was a stylish 12 rounds of work and Britain has another worthy champion to celebrate.

The Jackal, as challenger, had entered the ring first to a great howl of acclaim from the Ulster gathering  reconciled behind their symbol of the new Belfast. Had this been indoors the din would have been deafening. But although a little of the euphoria dissipated into the cold night air it was still an electrifying atmosphere in a statement venue. The formalities of the first round were less rousing but Frampton connected with enough crisp rights to take it.

Martinez sensed he had to march into the line of fire but was repeatedly picked off. When he did get to close quarters Frampton was the sharper in-fighter. Although he walked on to one right himself he was already building a solid lead. 

Martinez had done well to regroup and win the IBF belt since losing to Frampton last year but the Jackal looked to have improved even more. This was growing into an impressive evening for Frampton – and a potentially long one for a champion who could not land cleanly.

Frampton was down early in the fifth but English referee Steve Gray ruled it a slip – not to the approval of all in the Titanic Quarter. There was no doubt when Frampton connected with the sharp right which decked the champion. Martinez also suffered a slight cut as he battled to stay in the fight.

This was one way traffic and Martinez needed all his courage keep resisting the storm. The Frampton left was as wound as the right now and the Spaniard was beginning to resemble a bull being stuck by the picador. The chance was there for The Jackal to improve on his ninth-round stoppage first time

It was almost a novelty when Martinez connected with a cuffing left hook – but he was punished by a stinging Frampton combination for his trouble. Still Martinez kept coming – and getting hit.

Martinez at last enjoyed some success in the eighth session. After outscoring the challenger in the clinches he shook Frampton with a left and a right and finally had a round to call his own.

An encouraged Martinez raised the pace at the start of the next but after forcing Frampton even further on to the back foot he shipped more damaging counter punches.

Martinez needed a knockout to keep his title but he was the one being rocked repeatedly. But although the crowd appreciated the quick, slick quality of their man’s work they were growing a mite impatient for a knock-out finish. The tenth was another round in the Ulster bag.

But for a cautious tendency Frampton would surely have finished it by now. The faithful were not as animated but a sudden burst of Belfast aggression had them back on their feet and Martinez did well to make it to the bell.

The pair embraced at the start of the last round, one acknowledging the skill and one the courage of the other. Again the gallant Spaniard survived a barrage as Frampton went for the grandstand finish, The knock-out punch did not materialise and Martinez battled for a deserved share of the 12th.

It was a landslide victory for Frampton; his first world title was well won, if not in fully spectacular fashion.
