Over nine pages, Roy Allison wrote of his inconsolable grief following the death of his only son.

But it was not until the very end of his desperate letter that the pensioner revealed his vengeful plan to 'get his house in order'– by murdering the 'drug-dealing scum'he believed had taken the life of his child.

The 65-year-old grief-stricken father then posted the confessional note to police and a local newspaper before making good on his promise by stabbing 'junkie'Duncan Bell through the heart.

professional, who died on his 28th birthday. Mr Allison ran the Ju-Jitsu
Budo Academy with his son and was thought to be in peak condition when 
he died

Own justice: Roy Allison, 65, left, is suspected of killing Duncan Bell, 36, right, who was found stabbed to death in Hetley, Peterborough, in the early hours of last Sunday. Mr Allison was found hanged a few hours later

He then hanged himself at the crematorium where the funeral of his son, Roy Allison Junior, was held three months ago.

The suicide letter arrived on Tuesday this week – three days after Mr Allison embarked on his mission of murderous revenge.

Neatly typed, it reveals how obsessed he was with idea that Mr Bell, 36, had given his son an Ecstasy-type pill.

He writes: 'He will lose his life at 
my hand, it won’t bring my son back, God knows I would give anything for
that, but the man who caused it will not walk the earth anymore [sic] 
to enjoy life or hurt anyone anymore [sic], he will not have all the 
things he denied my son in the world and he will not hurt anyone in the 
future.'

Under the heading 'Pure Scum’, Mr 
Allison, who raised his son alone at their home in Peterborough, 
Cambridgeshire, after separating from his wife Mary 25 years ago, writes
of how even though he is 'weakened'by grief, he is determined to have 
his 'own justice’.

Grieving:
The nine page letter Mr Allison Sr sent to the Peterborough Telegraph. 
He also posted copies to various addresses including the police and they
were believed to have been posted late on Saturday

Pain:
The heartbreaking letter which Roy Allison Sr wrote to his dead son. Mr
Allison feared a coroner might not find Mr Bell accountable for his 
son's death at an inquest which was due to be held at the end of the 
month

He adds: 'The law is the law but 
justice is another matter, we don’t get justice, we don’t even get 
competence in the workings of it, I take my own justice and I believe it
is right for me to rid this scum away from the community.'

In an emotional note stapled to the 
letter, he explains to his dead son – a cage-fighter who died the day 
after his 28th birthday – his reasons for committing suicide.

It reads: 'You know I love you so much
that I will never leave you alone or deserted, you know I must tread on
the same path as you, the same route, and find you, we are two hearts 
that beat as one, it cannot be any other way, someone said to me “your 
son would not want you to sacrifice your life for him”, I told him, “it 
would not be a sacrifice, it would be an honour”.

'I will be where you are very soon 
now, I will walk the same road and search for you and never stop 
searching for you, fight back to find me, if you are in heaven all is 
well, but if there is nothing but wilderness then I will join you in 
that wilderness, either way, where you go, I go.

'I will hold you again, I will feel 
you again. I will see your smile and hear your voice again and I will 
hold you tight. But first I must find you. I love you.'

He describes Mr Bell as his son’s best
friend but also as 'one of the biggest drug dealers in the area'who he 
says drunkenly admitted to feeling guilt after Mr Allison Jnr, a Mixed 
Martial Arts fighter said to be in peak physical condition, died in 
mysterious circumstances in March. 

Death:
Mr Allison wrote that he felt suicidal after his son's death. He was 
found dead at 8.30am on Sunday in the grounds of Peterborough 
Crematorium (police cordon pictured) where his son's funeral was held in
April

He finishes the letter by saying that he is posting it to 14 places, including the police and Peterborough Telegraph.

Mr Bell, of Orton Goldhay, 
Peterborough, was found dead from a single stab wound to the heart at Mr
Allison’s home in the same town in the early hours of Sunday.

Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.

Mr Bell’s family said in a statement: 
'By simply being who he was he made the world a better place, he touched
so many lives and now he’s gone we all realise how lucky we were to 
have known him.'

Mr Allison and his son had a close 
relationship, living in the same house and running the Combat Ju-Jitsu 
Budo Academy together in Peterborough.

Friends said Mr Allison had been depressed since his son died, then two weeks ago his own brother died.

Martial arts trainer Clifton Findley, 
46, said: 'Roy Snr doted on his son and was devastated after his death. I
just knew he was going to kill himself because he had nothing to live 
for – but taking Duncan with him is a different story.

'I knew Duncan Bell and I know he was a
drug abuser. I can’t understand why Roy junior used to hang around with
him. Roy never used to do drugs and he hardly drank.

'I think he took something when he 
went out with Duncan to celebrate his birthday. They went to the pub and
Roy got to bed at 4am. I think his dad left him to sleep it off, but he
never woke up.

'For someone as fit as Roy to go to sleep and not wake up, he must have taken something.’

Mr Allison Jnr was found dead at home 
on March 21. The results of the post-mortem have not been released but 
police have described it as 'unexplained'and not suspicious.

A police spokesman said: 'We will examine the letter as part of the investigation into the deaths.'
