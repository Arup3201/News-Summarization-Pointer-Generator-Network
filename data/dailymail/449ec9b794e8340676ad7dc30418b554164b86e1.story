America really is run by the smart, a researcher has claimed.

Fortune 500 CEOs, billionaires, federal judges, Senators, and House members were all found to be largely comprised of those in the top 1% of intelligence.

The researchers concluded 'America's elite are largely drawn from the intellectually gifted, with many in the top 1% of ability.'

Individuals were deemed to be in the top 1% of ability if they attended an undergraduate or graduate school that had extremely high average standardized test scores that put the typical person well within the top 1%.

Researchers have determined that standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, give a reasonably good â€” yet of course imperfect â€” measure of a person's general reasoning capacity.

Five groups of America's elite were examined by Duke University's Jonathan Wai: Fortune 500 CEOs, federal judges, billionaires, Senators, and members of the House of Representatives.

'Within each of these groups, nearly all had attended college with the majority having attended either a highly selective undergraduate institution or graduate school of some kind,' Jonathan Wai wrote in the journal Intelligence.

'High average test scores required for admission to these institutions indicated those who rise to or are selected for these positions are highly filtered for ability.'

The team also looked at differences between sectors in which billionaires made their money.

'Ability and education level differences were found across various sectors in which the billionaires earned their wealth (e.g., technology vs. fashion and retail); even within billionaires and CEOs wealth was found to be connected to ability and education.

Wai said today's elites are increasingly coming from the high end of the IQ distribution.

'That's especially true in highly complex fields like finance and tech,' Wai wrote in Business Insider.

'Billionaires in the investments and technology sectors had the largest fraction of people who were also in the top 1% of cognitive ability.

'Think Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Larry Page, and Mark Zuckerberg.'

He also examined the mix in the US political system.

'Within the Senate and House, Democrats had a higher level of ability and education than Republicans.

'Females were underrepresented among all groups, but to a lesser degree among federal judges and Democrats and to a larger degree among Republicans and CEOs.

However, Wai wrote in Business Insider that the work did not prove that America's top performers still had their limits.

'This does not mean they are geniuses (I would reserve that term for someone who does mind-bending work like Albert Einstein); but they are really smart.'

Researchers also analysed the male top female ratio in each group

In general the research found women were largely underrepresented.

Notably, female Fortune 500 CEOs were underrepresented by a factor of 28.3 to 1, Wai said.

'But among those women who had climbed the ranks, they had to be smarter and more select, on average, than their male counterparts,' he said.

Roughly 60% of female CEOs but only 40% of male CEOs were in the top 1% of cognitive ability.

The connection between attending Harvard University and being a part of America's elite was also investigated.

Roughly 11% to 13% of CEOs, judges, billionaires, and Senators had attended Harvard in some capacity, but only 6.6% of the House did so.
