Tragic: Jim Garcia, 71, passed away on June 30 when he collapsed just yards from a VA hospital

The heartbroken wife of a Vietnam veteran who died in a VA hospital cafeteria as he waited for an ambulance to arrive is still demanding answers about what happened.

Carol Garcia had received a phone call on June 30 saying her husband, 71-year-old Jim Napoleon Garcia, had collapsed in the cafeteria beside the VA hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

But rather than rush him the 500 yards to the emergency room, staff followed VA policy and called for an ambulance. The policy instructs staff to call 911 for an emergency outside the main hospital.

Mr Garcia, a grandfather, received CPR as he lay on the floor but he passed away.

'If my 
husband had been treated quicker, could he have survived his heart 
attack?' his wife of 32 years, Carol, asked in an interview with KOAT as her sons comforted her.

Emergency response records show that an ambulance arrived to help Garcia about 10 minutes after the 911 call.

Mrs Garcia said she believes that authorities have not been straight with her about her husband's death.

'We're trying to get answers and they 
keep shutting down,' she said. 'They keep saying they want to be 
transparent but they're not.'

Last week, acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson met with Mrs Garcia and her sons and told them he was going to launch a full investigation. He promised them a copy of their results, she said.

But the next day, VA officials from Washington, D.C. announced contradicting news in a press conference, saying that all efforts had been made to save Mr Garcia's life.

At the press conference, Gibson said an initial review found staffers followed procedure in providing help to the Vietnam War veteran.

'I thanked every single one of them individually,' he said. 'As I heard what they did, and I stood and looked at them in the eye, I was very proud.'

He added that it would have been difficult to keep Garcia on an automated external defibrillator or perform CPR if he was placed on a gurney and rush to the emergency room on foot.

Mrs Garcia said the statement made no sense.

'He says VA is not at fault in the vet's death and I don't know how they could say that when the autopsy hasn't been concluded yet,' she said.

She is now demanding answers as well as a policy change to prevent a similar tragedy happening to another family.

Attorneys representing the Garcia family will file a federal tort claim this week, giving the VA notice that they plan to sue over the death.

Mr Garcia had served in Vietnam from 1964 to 1966.

The family said he was an active member of the Innocents Car Club of North Hollywood, The Bottle and Insulator Club of New Mexico, and a collector of coins, insulators and Depression-era glasses.

The family's anger comes as the VA deals with a national outcry over reports of long delays for treatment and medical appointments and of veterans dying while on waiting lists.
