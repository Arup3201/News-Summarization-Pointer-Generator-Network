With their vivid colours and swirling shapes, the northern lights are already considered one of the most magical sights to see.

But this might just be the most enchanting sight yet - the image of a dragon's head appearing as the Northern Lights dance across the night sky. 

The ghostly shape of the mythical creature was formed out of swathes of green as the lights appeared in the Arctic Circle.

These long-exposure images were captured by astrophotographer Juan Carlos Casado, 55, who described them as 'mesmerising'.

'Auroras make you relaxed and you dream like you are a kid,' he said.

'The movements cause changing and beautiful forms within minutes, sometimes with intense colours, and if activity is high their size can completely fill the sky.

'There is a sense of great joy to observe directly something you've previously only known from photographs or documentaries.'

Other spectacular shapes forming included a bird above a jacuzzi full of tourists and a rainbow arching over a still fjord.

The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, occurs when highly charged electrons from solar wind interact with elements in the earth's atmosphere

Casado, from Badajoz, Spain, captured the images at the Qaleralit glacier and Tasiusaq and Qasiarsuq Inuit farms in Greenland - where ancestral natives believe the auroras were their dead rising to heaven.

Others were captured at Hestheimar Farm in southern Iceland.

Each shot was captured using a long exposure while panoramic views were 'stitched' together, and so are 100 per cent authentic.

As the electrons enter the upper atmosphere, they encounter atoms of oxygen and nitrogen at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles above the earth's surface

Casado added: 'The images are real photographs of several seconds of exposure. Some images are stitched shots to get panoramic views of the surroundings and the sky.

'So sometimes the pictures of auroras may look faked. But really it is our vision's limit to capture the authentic splendor of the phenomenon.'
