Earlier this year teenager Dwayne Ward was subject to a horrific and bloody assault while on holiday in Turkey with his family.

After Dwayne, 17, became separated from his brother Darren, 32, while out drinking on the famous Bar Street in the holiday resort of Marmaris he was approached by two Turkish men who proceeded to stab him 19 times, slash his body, face and neck with a razor blade, strip him naked and leave him for dead in a park.

Dwayne's life was left hanging in the balance, all because he had kissed a local girl earlier in the evening.

Turkish surgeon Dr Selim Mavili, who carried out emergency life-saving surgery on Dwayne, from Middlesbrough, Cleveland, said the teen was 'lucky to be alive' when he arrived at the local hospital.

The teenager made an incredible recovery, and left hospital just one week later, but the ordeal has left his family deeply shaken.

Today Dwayne and his mother Doris appeared on ITV's This Morning to warn other tourists not to go to Bar Street and to beware of making themselves vulnerable.

Doris said: 'We were happy on that first day,Â  I thought: this will be a holiday we will remember.

'The following day we went into the town centre to have a meal. We left the boys to it at 12:30, they wanted to have fun. Dwayne wanted to go to Bar Street, which is what teenagers do.'

Doris, already concerned for her sons' safety, warned the boys to look after one another, and, most importantly, to stay together.

She said: 'I was saying to them: "Don't lose each other, stick together like glue."'

But the boys were soon separated, leaving Dwayne vulnerable.

He told This Morning host Holly Willoughby: 'Mum left, we went down to Bar Street and went in a few bars and pubs.'

The last thing Dwayne remembers is getting hit in the back of the head. His next moment of consciousness came when he awoke in a Turkish hospital with police by his bedside.

Doris first realised that something might be wrong when Darren came back to the hotel alone asking where his brother was before flaking out on his bed, worse the wear from too much alcohol.

Doris sais: 'I jumped up, started shouting at Darren, "You've lost him!"

'I got ready and went out looking for him. I hadn't been to that part of Marmaris before and went four or five blocks before I went back thinking I was going to get lost.

'I just sat waiting in the hotel. I knew something had happened.

'The man on reception said "You're son has been arrested," I was quite relieved, at least I knew he was safe.'

Doris didn't see her son until eight hours later, she described the time as a surreal experience: 'I didn't feel like it was me standing there. It was like I was on the outside looking in.'

With the help of the town's CCTV cameras the police were able to piece the evening together. Some footage showed Dwayne walking with some men, more footage showed him being dragged as his head lolled to one side. By this point he was unconscious.

Two men Attila Dincer, 26, and another 
named only as Ismail A, 24, have since admitted a series of offences including attempted murder and intent to kidnap.

Dwayne suffers from regular flashbacks and is still on medication following the incident. His advice for other young people on holiday in the area is simple: 'Bar Street is dangerous. Don't go to Bar Street.'
