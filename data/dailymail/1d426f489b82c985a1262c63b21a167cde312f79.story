Universal Studios has a sealed an agreement to open a £2bn theme park in Beijing, the culmination of a 13-year effort to enter China's fast-growing entertainment market.

US theme park operators are rushing to build in China, where there are few high-quality parks and park revenues are growing rapidly as city dwellers spend more on entertainment and travel.

The Beijing Universal theme park, to be developed with the state firm Beijing Tourism Group Co, will have China-themed attractions in addition to well-known ones based on Western brands like the Harry Potter series when it opens.

Plans for the future: The projected £2bn development of Universal's Beijing theme park

Tom Williams, chairman and chief executive of Universal Parks and Resorts, told a news conference in Beijing that the park would also aim to draw visitors from outside China, while Hollywood director Steven Spielberg said on video that he would be participating in its design.

'There is Disneyland in Hong Kong, but there isn't really anything of equivalent quality of a tourist attraction on the mainland yet,' said James Roy, associate principle of China Market Research Group. 

'It has a chance to be very successful.'

It will compete against rival Walt Disney Co, which is constructing a £2.8bn theme park set to be completed next year, as well as a £2bn entertainment complex that DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc and Chinese partners are working to finish by 2016.

Both of those parks will be located in Shanghai.

Universal declined to comment on an opening date but a local newspaper said the opening was slated for 2019.

Universal Studios is part of NBCUniversal, a media and entertainment unit of Comcast Corp, the largest cable company in the US. It operates theme parks in Los Angeles, Orlando, Osaka and Singapore.

Comcast reported £620m in total theme park income in 2013.

Universal and Beijing Tourism Group (BTG) will create two joint-venture companies to build and manage the project. BTG will hold 70 per cent of the construction firm, while Universal will hold 70 per cent of the operating company. 

The park will be developed on about 300 acres  in eastern Beijing.

They said the Beijing park will include attractions from other Universal parks as well as new ones reflecting China's cultural heritage.

The complex will eventually cover about 1,000 acres  and feature a Universal CityWalk entertainment zone and a Universal-themed resort hotel.

It will be the third Universal park in Asia, with the others in Singapore and Osaka, Japan.
