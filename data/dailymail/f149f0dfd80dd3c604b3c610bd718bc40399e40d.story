The squeeze on family budgets has lasted for four years and shows no sign of coming to an end, grim new figures revealed today.

Disposable incomes have remained almost unchanged since the end of the recession, with the return to economic growth having little impact on ordinary people’s spending power.

Instead bills for life’s essentials like housing, energy and petrol have dramatically eaten into incomes, and now account for more than 27 per cent of all spending.

Squeeze: Household essentials like housing, and utility bills not account for 27% of incomes, up from less than 20% a decade ago

The Office for National Statistics warned the economic position of households ‘remains under pressure’.

Disposable incomes grew even when Britain was plunged into recession in mid-2008, but have remained ‘broadly flat’ since the summer of 2009, despite the economy growing by 4.2 per cent since then.

The revelation will pile pressure on David Cameron and George Osborne, who have been attacked by Labour for overseeing a recovery not being enjoyed by everyone.

In particular big rises in energy bills have had a devastating impact on families.

Unchanged: Since the end of the recession in 2009 disposable incomes have remained largely unchanged despite economy growth

Four of the Big Six firms have already
 announced big price rises this winter.

ScottishPower bills will go up 
by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a
 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent 
increase.

Since 2003, the proportion of income used on ‘essential’ household goods has risen from 19.9 per cent to 27.3 per cent in 2013.

Gas and electricity bills now account 3.1 per cent of household income, up from 1.8 per cent in 2003 ‘despite very little overall change in the volume of household energy consumption’, the ONS said.

The squeeze on incomes has added to the slow recovery, because a lack of spending has failed to provide a boost to shops and businesses.

Recently announced price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100

The ONS added: ‘While the majority of this increase has been in the cost of housing – which has increased from 14.7 per cent to 20.6 per cent between 2003 and 2013 – there have also been increases in the proportion accounted for by gas, electricity and water & sewerage.

‘The rise in these proportions has the effect of reducing household budgets for spending on other goods and products.’

TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Today’s figures confirm that households are not benefiting from the recovery.

‘Growth matters because it raises people’s living standards. But this basic rule has been broken under an austerity-obsessed government.

‘Most people will not feel as if we are in recovery if all the gains from growth are hogged by the same old elites, at the cost of ordinary families.

‘The government must wake up and start tackling our cost of living crisis. It can start by taking on the excessive profits of the big energy firms that have pushed energy bills up so much that households are now spending more on gas and electricity than they are on filling up the car.’
