One of the men who was trapped on broken scaffolding while working at One World Trade Center on Wednesday is sharing his story of the heartbreaking phone call he made to his wife.

Juan Lizama, of Hudson County, New Jersey, says he called his wife Hilda to say farewell, unsure of what was going to happen to him and fellow window washer Juan Lopez as they dangled 69 floors high while working at the skyscraper.

The two were trapped for 90 minutes before members of the Fire Department of New York managed to rescue them by breaking through a panel of glass on the 68th floor and pull them in to safety.

Getting to safety: The first window washer is pulled in to One World Trade Center by members of FDNY on Wednesday

Terrifying day: The two men spent 90 minutes dangling 69 stories high after their scaffold collapsed, trapping them on the side of the building

'I don’t know what’s going to happen,' Juan says he told his wife when he called.

'We’re real high. I don’t know if or how it’s going to turn out.'

Then, according to the New York Post, he began to say his goodbyes in case the worst happened.

'I love you,' he told his wife. 

'Take care of the children.' 

Before: Members of FDNY stand near Lopez and Lizama as they decide the best way to get the men to safety

After: Ultimately, a hole was cut in the glass and the two men were pulled in

Then his phone died.

Hilda and oldest son Kevin then spent the next hour praying in their living room, hoping that everything would turn out for the best.

And it did, when shortly after 2pm the men were pulled in from their rig, without any injuries.

The men were then rushed to Bellevue Hospital where they were treated for mild hypothermia.
