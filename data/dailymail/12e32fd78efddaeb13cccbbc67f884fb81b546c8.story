It is one of the biggest markets in the tourist hot spot of Langowan, Indonesia.

But  you won't want to face this on an empty stomach.

From battered snake to spit-roasted bats, the smorgasbord of traditional delicacies on offer are not exactly appetising.

Macabre: Spit-roasted bats are stacked on a plastic tables at Langowan Market in Sulawesi, Indonesia

Horrifying: Live dogs are sat in cages before being roasted with a blow torch on the muck-covered pavement

Grotesque: Tourists look in horror at lizards lying on their backs - cut open - with their insides on display

Live dogs sit in cages before they are roasted with blowtorches on the pavement.

Three-metre-long snakes lie sprawled across the tables of blood-covered carcasses.

Other delights include pickled rats, boar legs, and bite-size bats on sticks. 

And roasted lizards are cut open and displayed on their backs - with their insides on show. 

Casual: Locals casually survey the bloody carcasses of boars and bats, which are delicacies in the region

Snack: Bite-size black bats are sold on sticks to market-goers, which will make holiday-goers' stomachs turn

Controversy: The market is under constant surveillance by the government after selling endangered species

Graphic: Vegetables and spices are sold at the market but the hanging boar legs will stay in tourists' minds

The market, in the northern region of  Sulawesi, was marred by controversy in 1993 after government inspectors found sellers to be trading babirusa, an endangered type of wild pig. 

Despite numerous regulations put in place, it took years to eliminate the trade. 

However, the bizarre market has now become something of a tourist attraction - but few are willing to taste their way through the full menu.

Not far from Langowan, the Tomohon Traditional Market also attracts a fair few horrified holidaymakers - and families planning their evening meal.

All in a day's work: A market seller hacks away at a three-metre-long snake using three different knives

Portions: The segments are gruesomely displayed on the dirty, tiled worktops for customers to buy

Stash: One customer has stocked up on roasted rats for this evening's meal, piling them all into a basket

Grab-and-go: This man appears to have forgotten a bag - but seems not to mind carrying to wild boars' legs

Family day out: A child munches on a treat bought from the traditional market while his family select their meal

They casually survey the torched animals - lying frozen with a facial expression of horror - before selecting an entire snake or dog to serve up to the kids later.

Travel blogger Raymond Walsh described the smell of the Tomohon market on his blog www.manonthelam.com.

Mr Walsh said: 'In a word, appalling. There's something about the air that changes when there's that much death around.

'It hangs heavy and it made me queasy and light-headed at the same time... It's the first time I'd ever encountered anything like it.'
