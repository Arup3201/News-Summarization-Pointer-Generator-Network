The Football Association have rejected Tottenham Hotspur's appeal against full-back Kyle Naughton's red card for tripping Stoke's Victor Moses during Sunday's home defeat.

Naughton will serve an immediate two-match ban after the appeal was dismissed by an independent regulatory commission hearing on Tuesday.

The 26-year-old was deemed to deny Moses a goal scoring opportunity in the 85th minute at White Hart Lane during Tottenham's fourth Barclays Premier League loss of the season.

It was Naughton's second red card of the season and the defender will miss matches against Hull and Everton

Naughton will miss the trip to Hull on November 23 and the home game against Everton a week later after his second dismissal of the season.

The red card only made matters worse for Mauricio Pochettino with Stoke already leading 2-1 by that point through  Bojan Krkic and Jon Walters.

Tottenham have lost four out of five home Premier League games for the first time since October 2008, and have had a league-high six men sent off in 2014.
