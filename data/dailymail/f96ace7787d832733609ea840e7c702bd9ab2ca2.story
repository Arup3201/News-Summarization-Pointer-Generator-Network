CLICK HERE to read how the German plans to pip Lewis Hamilton to the post in Abu Dhabi

Nico Rosberg offered Lewis Hamilton his hand, and he stared at it as if it had come from Mars, not from the friend of his racing youth.

At least boxers look each other in the eye at the weigh-in, even if they are chewing and snarling. But Hamilton found it hard even to meet Rosberg’s gaze when they came together for the traditional handshake of title contenders ahead of Thursday’s press conference.

Rosberg was the more chipper of the pair. Shoulders back, a swagger in his step. He took the initiative in putting out his paw. He has nothing to lose. He is already second in the table, 17 points behind his Mercedes colleague going into Sunday’s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

The title challengers finally appeared to shake hands properly during the drivers' press conference

1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points 

2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points 

Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race.

If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish.

Perhaps he felt renewed confidence after his win in Interlagos a fortnight ago. It was maybe the best win of his career and one of the few occasions he has beaten Hamilton in an absolutely straight fight.

Hamilton insisted he was not nervous but, if I had a pound for every championship leader who has tried to kid himself into believing that on the eve of the deciding race, I could almost afford a lemonade in the opulent Viceroy hotel overlooking the track.

This tension stalked the final pre-race press conference of the season — always the most intense all year. On Thursday, the camera lenses chattered like cicada on the Great Wall of China.

It was a far cry from their carefree days as young karters in Team MBM. Half their lifetimes ago they were in Parma with Robert Kubica, a great karting talent lost to Formula One after a rallying accident.

Kubica recalled: ‘They would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time.’ As Kubica told the BBC: ‘They always wanted to win, to beat each other. It was friendly competition. There was always laughing afterwards.’

Hamilton and Rosberg ate vanilla ice cream in the middle of the night, wrestled and slept in the same room.

‘Probably the first bit of real competition we had was when Nico used to ride a unicycle everywhere,’ said Hamilton. ‘So I thought, “I’ve got to learn to ride this unicycle. I’ve got to be better than him.” I spent all my time outside the go-kart learning to ride this unicycle.’

Ah, they were more innocent days, before the on-track skirmishes of this campaign.

On Thursday, Lewis, wearing a white cap with a Union Flag on the underside of the peak, struggled to smile such was the burden on him. His answers were polite but short.

This is largely understandable: he is on the verge of one of the biggest days of his life and he considers reporters’ questions to be unwelcome hoops to jump through en route to the grid on Sunday.

Yet despite the world’s glare, he said: ‘I generally feel it’s quite similar to back in the karting days.

‘At that age it was as intense as I had experienced. I wanted to win back then and nothing’s changed.’

Rosberg, separated on the dais from his old buddy by Nico Hulkenberg, was not in total agreement, saying: ‘It’s quite amazing to think now that 15 years later we’re actually in the position we used to dream about: to be in the best F1 team, fighting for the championship, fighting for the race wins. It’s really amazing.

‘It is more intense now. There is more surrounding it — that’s the best way to put it.’

Before the official press conference, the two men conducted their respective media briefings on opposing sides of the Mercedes hospitality area.

Rosberg spoke in German, with his assistant Georg, a former Bild journalist, watching on intently.

The separation — one drivers’ huddle in one place, the other’s nearby — was reminiscent of Hamilton’s first Formula One championship fight. 

Debris flies in the air as Rosberg and Hamilton's Mercedes controversially make contact at Belgian Grand Prix

Fernando Alonso will leave Ferrari to be replaced by Sebastian Vettel at the end of the season

Fernando Alonso, whose departure from Ferrari to be replaced by Sebastian Vettel was confirmed , would plot and scheme with his Spanish reporter pals; Hamilton would speak to us British hacks.

The level of skulduggery is certainly less overt this time round. Rosberg, ruthless though he can be, is the modern company man down to his neat fingernails and would never let off grenades the way Alonso did. And Hamilton, headstrong though he can be, does not have a Machiavellian mind. But there is still some serious niggle.

As they left here in the dusk of the desert night, Rosberg went to be with his wife Vivian, who will be joined at the track by a few of his friends. It is Rosberg’s usual entourage. Hamilton left with his Finnish trainer Ville Vihola. Neither his father nor mother is here. His girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger is also absent, as she has been all season. It is doubtful anyone concerned got an uninterrupted night’s sleep.
