In the heated yoga studio, the sweat is beginning to form on my upper 
lip. Just a few minutes ago, we were warming up with gentle sun 
salutations –  the traditional flowing move that opens most yoga 
classes.

Now I’m holding 6lb hand weights and huffing and puffing my way
 through squats, performed on a step platform for maximum intensity.

And,
 led by Zander, a ponytailed hunk who looks as if he should be modelling
 in Men’s Health magazine, it is becoming clear that this isn’t going to
 be yoga as my red-faced classmates and I know it.

Stretch and bend: Yoga devotees Naomi Watts and Reese Witherspoon are pictured here leaving a class in Brentwood, Los Angeles

I’m at the new PXT conditioning class at the slick Pure Yoga studio on Manhattan’s Upper East Side: one of several ‘yoga bootcamp’-style classes to have sprung up across Manhattan, where gentle stretching and meditative breathing techniques meet high-intensity cardio drills.

Inventor Loren Bassett
 says: ‘As much as I love yoga, I’ve always believed in cross training 
to stay in peak condition. You can’t just do one kind of workout – you 
need to shock your body to see any real change.’

And so she created a 
class ‘where you would leave feeling physically challenged, but also 
calm and grounded’.

Hollywood fans Taryn Toomey's The Class is a 75 minute workout popular with celebrities like Naomi

As well as a yoga warm-up  and cool-down, some of
 the muscle-quaking conditioning moves mimic yoga poses – like the 
‘supta baddha konasana’ sit-ups, gruelling crunches with your legs 
splayed and soles together for an intense core workout.

The yogic 
principal of ‘darana’ – or concentration – is also employed throughout, 
while Loren encourages the use of a mantra, a sacred word or phrase of 
encouragement, to help you stay the distance. 

‘A lot of the time it’s the mind that gives up before the body,’ she explains.

A
 similar principal lies behind the success of Taryn Toomey’s The Class, 
an excruciating  75 minutes already a favourite among A-listers 
including actress Naomi Watts.

Taryn describes the workout as ‘a morph of yoga-based breath and meditation, coupled with a sculpting, bootcamp-style class’.

Using
 repetitive movements to music to work a muscle group, you soon enter 
what Taryn calls the pain room – ‘which is when I cue the breath’, she 
says.

‘You get to that place where  the panic button goes off and  
you think ‘‘no way’’, but by focusing on their breathing, I want people 
to learn that they can simply observe what’s going on for them while 
they finish the set.’

Some devotees reportedly experience a physical change after just a few sessions.

Back
 at Pure Yoga, Zander is wrapping up class with a traditional yoga 
relaxation. As my heartbeat returns to normal, the hard work is soon a 
distant memory and I leave relaxed, calm and focused – but dripping in 
sweat.

There are hundreds of more rigorous yoga classes. Try:

David Cameron’s gone dairy-free and George Osborne’s doing the  5:2 diet – and looked every inch the statesman (although a few inches less, thankfully, than last time around) when he delivered the Budget this week.

Even Nick Clegg has taking up kickboxing. At last, our politicians seem to be following President Barack Obama and Bill Clinton in setting a healthy example.

Obama holds meetings from his treadmill and Clinton reversed his heart disease and lost two stone by going vegan in 2011. Where America leads, Britain isn’t far behind.

But have our alpha males finally realised what Manhattan’s twenty and thirtysomething women have known for ages – that eating a healthy diet and keeping fit are the best ways to stay at the top of your game?

Healthy Chancellor: George Osborne is following the 5:2 diet and showed off his weight loss this week, while David Cameron is now dairy free

Media mogul Arianna Huffington’s new book Thrive encourages us to 
reconsider traditional notions of ‘success’ and to  think about our 
overall sense of wellbeing.

‘In the course of achieving it all, have we 
left ourselves behind?’ she asked when I interviewed her on the topic. 
Her top tips? Get more sleep and learn how to master technology so that 
you control it, not the other way around.

A disgusting fermented yeast called kombucha appears to be the new coconut water.

All
 my hip friends are toting bottles of the brew, which promises to aid 
detoxification, boost immunity and keep joints healthy.

Hardcore
 devotees even brew their own from a ‘mother’ yeast culture, which can 
be quite dangerous. Personally, I think it’s like drinking fizzy 
vinegar.

DOCTOR Frank Lipman of Manhattan’s trendy Eleven Eleven Wellness centre (Gwyneth Paltrow is a regular) has told me he sometimes plays reggae to his clients to help them meditate.

‘Your brain “entrains” to the rhythms around you, and reggae tends to have about 60 beats per minute – the speed of a slow heartbeat – which tends to slow you down as a result,’ he said.

No wonder they’re all so laid back in Jamaica.
