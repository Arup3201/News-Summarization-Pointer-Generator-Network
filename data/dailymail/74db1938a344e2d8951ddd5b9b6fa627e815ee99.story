An asteroid capable of destroying London has successfully skimmed past the Earth.

The 150ft, 130,000 ton chunk of space rock was the nearest flyby for an object of this size since records began.

Although scientists said there was little chance of asteroid 2012 DA14 hitting our planet - if it did, it would have inflicted 1,000 times more damage than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

Its closest approach, passing within 
17,000 miles (27,357 kilometers), which is closer than some satellites, was at 7.25pm, GMT.

The flyby occurred just hours after a much smaller meteor exploded above Russia's Ural Mountains. 
Astronomers say the two events were coincidental, and the objects were 
traveling in opposite directions.

The asteroid delighted astronomers in Australia and elsewhere who watched it zip harmlessly through a clear night sky. 

'It's on its way out,' reported Paul Chodas of NASA.

The asteroid was too small to see with the naked eye even at its closest approach over the Indian Ocean near Sumatra. 

The best viewing locations, with binoculars and telescopes, were in Asia, Australia and eastern Europe. Even there, all anyone could see was a pinpoint of light as the asteroid buzzed by at 17,400 mph (28,000 kph). 

As asteroids go, this one was relatively small. The one that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago was 6 miles across.

But this rock could still do immense 
damage if it ever struck given its 143,000-ton heft, releasing the 
energy equivalent of 2.4 million tons of TNT and wiping out 750 square 
miles.

By comparison, NASA estimated that 
the meteor that exploded over Russia was much smaller - about 49 feet 
(15 meters) wide and 7,000 tons before it hit the atmosphere, or 
one-third the size of the passing asteroid.

Speaking about the back-to-back events, Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary science, said: 'This is indeed very rare and it is historic.

'These fireballs happen about once a 
day or so, but we just don't see them because many of them fall over the
ocean or in remote areas. This one was an exception.'

Dave Herald, an amateur astronomer in Murrumbateman, Australia, captured the asteroid - seen here as the black line as it moves across the sky/ The three minute exposure shows the fast movement of Asteroid 2012 DA14 seven hours before closest approach. At its closest approach, the object will be moving so fast as to cover this distance in approximately 15 seconds.

The asteroid was invisible to astronomers in the United States at the 
time of its closest approach on the opposite of the world.

But in 
Australia, astronomers used binoculars and telescopes to watch the point
of light speed across the clear night sky.

The asteroid cut through the orbit of 
some satellites used for weather forecasting and for satellite phones 
and television.

This afternoon it was spotted by amateur astronomer Dave Herald in, Murrumbateman, Australia.

Asteroid 2012 DA14 is seen as a streak running almost vertically at centre of the image.

Close shave: Asteroid 2012 DA14 will pass just 17,100 miles from Earth at around 7.30pm. 'In astronomical 
terms, that's very close,' said astronomer and asteroid expert Daniel 
Brown of Nottingham Trent University

It is a three-minute min exposure, with the asteroid seen at -82.5 degrees and heading south.

The streak is quite regular - indicating no major brightness variations over a time scale of three minutes.

At closest approach, the object was moving so fast as to cover this distance in approximately 15 seconds.

Donald
Yeomans, manager of NASA's Near-Earth Object program at the Jet 
Propulsion Lab, has insisted: 'No Earth impact is possible.'

A few hundred satellites orbit at 22,300 miles, higher than the asteroid's path, but scientists say the chance of it hitting one is extremely remote. Nevertheless, satellite operators have been warned

However,
he added, its journey through space will bring it so close to our 
planet that stargazers from Europe to Australia will be able to see it 
with just a pair of binoculars.

'This flyby will provide a unique opportunity for researchers to study a near-Earth object up close.'

The
half-hour broadcast from the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena, California, included a real-time animation to show the 
location of the asteroid in relation to Earth.

There
were also live or near real-time views of the asteroid from 
observatories in Australia.

Scientists have never observed such a narrow miss before.

Through
binoculars, the object was visible as a tiny dot of light 
crossing the sky. It was recommended to look towards the north-east 
horizon around two hours after sunset.

ring of geo-stationary satellites

'It
will be too faint for the naked eye but with binoculars it should be 
visible if you know where to look. It will be low to the north-eastern 
horizon and moving quite quickly,' he said.

'You’ll
be able to see it pass from the constellation Leo to roughly the 
Plough, more or less from anywhere in the UK, and it will be bright for 
about an hour.'

Asteroid 
2012 DA14 belongs to dangerous family of near-Earth objects (NEOs) that 
are small enough to be missed but large enough to cause serious damage.

It
was discovered in February last year by La Sagra Observatory in 
southern Spain as it fell under the spotlight of the Sun’s rays, and has
been closely tracked ever since.

Travelling
at between 12,427mph and 18,641mph  the asteroid will fly inside the 
orbits of high geostationary satellites some 22,000 miles above the 
Earth.

These are the 
satellites that provide us with telecommunications and weather 
forecasts,' said Dr Brown. 'There are loads of them but you’re talking 
about a very big area. It would be very unlucky if a satellite was hit.

'The
asteroid is more likely to hit some space junk, but most of this is 
only about a centimetre across and the impact won’t even be noticed.'

The asteroid posed no danger to 
the International Space Station, which orbits at an altitude of only a 
few hundred kilometres.

The 
150ft-wide, 130,000-ton asteroid is considered small as these things go.
By contrast, the one that took out the dinosaurs 65million years ago 
was 6 miles wide.

Precise calculations showed there was absolutely no possibility of DA14 hitting the Earth, Dr Brown said.

But
scientists had a good idea of what the effect of such an impact would 
be because a similar sized meteor devastated a remote region of Siberia 
in 1908.

Exploding a short distance above the ground over Tunguska, the object generated a blast equivalent to 2.4million tons of TNT.

Forest was completely flattened over an area of 830 square miles.

'We think the object that impacted at Tunguska would have been of a similar size to DA14,' said Dr Brown.

'Actually,
it exploded in the air. It didn’t destroy humanity, but if this object 
had exploded over London it would have wiped out London.

'It’s not a global impact, but it’s a severe impact.'

The likelihood of something this size striking Earth is once in every 1,200 years; a close encounter like this is thought to occur every 40 years.

During the flypast, scientists will use radar to study DA14 and learn about its composition and structure.

The knowledge could prove useful if steps have to be taken to remove the threat of another space rock. The 'Hollywood option' of blowing up an incoming asteroid has been ruled out by experts.

Such a dramatic solution would only result in deadly debris raining down on Earth so scientists are instead looking at ways of gently nudging an asteroid onto a safer trajectory.

The bulk of the solar system's asteroids are located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and remain stable there for billions of years. Some occasionally pop out, though, into Earth's neighbourhood.
