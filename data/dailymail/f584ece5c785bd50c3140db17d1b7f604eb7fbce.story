A woman who went to hospital with stomach pains was stunned to discover she was 35 weeks pregnant and in labour.

Hannah Froud, 22, gave birth to her daughter Jessica just seven hours after doctors said her stomach cramps were actually labour pains.

The financial administrator from Chaddesden, Derbyshire, first started complaining of stomach ache on February 8 but the pain continued through the weekend.

On Monday, her work colleagues convinced her to visit the London Road Community Hospital in Derby.

Hannah Froud, 22, went to hospital after experiencing stomach pains and was shocked to be told that she was 35 weeks pregnant and in labour

She arrived at 10am and went through a series of checks and tests before eventually being given a pregnancy test.

To her utter shock, doctors told her she was in labour.

A nurse called Ms Froud’s boyfriend, 26-year-old Chris Bennett, to tell him to come to the centre to see her.

Mr Bennett, who works as a joiner, went to the hospital and transported Ms Froud to the Royal Derby Hospital, where she gave birth at 5pm.

Ms Froud said: ‘I wasn't bothered about taking the pregnancy test. They said it was routine for women complaining of stomach ache so I just went along with it.

Baby Jessica was born at 5pm, just seven hours after her mother learned she was pregnant

‘Not long after that, they told me I was pregnant. I was completely speechless.

‘The nurse didn't tell Chris the news over the phone, but he was just as shocked as me when he did find out. I remember him having to have a sit down.

‘It was so strange - everything just happened. One minute I had stomach ache, the next I was being told I was having a baby.'

So unprepared were Jessica's parents for her arrival, the hospital had to give the couple some baby clothes for her.

And despite the drama of a surprise 
birth, baby Jessica is perfectly healthy, according to Ms 
Froud.

She said: ‘She's a lovely little girl. Her sleeping is not a problem because she only wakes up once a night and we will certainly settle for that.

‘Things don't seem to have changed that much. I just no longer have to go work and I have a baby to bring up.

‘We can't wait for her to grow up and start playing with toys. At the moment all she seems to do is sleep.’
