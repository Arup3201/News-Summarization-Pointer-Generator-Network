An empty 'handcuff' box and two used condoms have been found in the desperate search for a missing 15-year-old schoolgirl.

Sierra LaMar was reported missing by her
mother on March 16, having never made it to the bus or her Morgan, Hill
California high school.

A search volunteer found the empty box which was marked 'handcuffs' yesterday within 1.5miles of where the pretty teen's Samsung cellphone and Juicy-brand handbag were found.

Mystery: Sierra Lamar, 15, disappeared on the walk to catch a bus to school on the morning of March 16

Police ruled the disappearance 
as a kidnapping as Sierra does not having a history as a runaway or any 
unusually negative family problems. Interviews with friends and a search
of her computer also yielded no information indicating she fled.

Investigators told Mercury News that the find could be a major breakthrough in the disappearance which has stumped police for two weeks, or it could be a simple coincidence.

The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office has sent the cardboard box and condoms for forensics tests.

'Other than the fact that it's pretty close to Sierra's mom's house, there's no indication at this time that it's related,' Sgt. Jose Cardoza told Mercury News. 'But we're collecting it as possible evidence.'

'This may be another significant piece of evidence, but it's hard to confirm that it's related at this time,' he added.

The box, which was used to ship handcuffs by an unknown manufacturer, was empty, Cardoza said.

Potential clue: The handcuff box and condoms were found, near the teenager's home, pictured, and close to where her phone and handbag were found abandoned as shown on the map

Hope: A fourth vigil was held last night for the missing 15-year-old in her hometown of Morgan Hill, California

It was found near a dead end about a mile from the intersection where Sierra was supposed to catch a bus bext to her home after 7am for school.

A
day after her disappearance, sheriff's deputies found Sierra's 
cellphone on Santa Teresa , an electronic window into her world which now sits in a San 
Jose crime lab undergoing forensic tests.

It
was in a field near where she normally caught a school bus in Morgan 
Hill, a semi-rural community of 40,240 on the fringes of Silicon Valley 
surrounded by mountains, orchards and reservoirs.

The day after deputies located her 
Samsung Galaxy smartphone, they came across Sierra's handbag a few 
blocks away. Several items of her clothing - a San Jose Sharks T-shirt, 
pants and undergarments - were folded neatly inside.

Clues: Her mother snapped this photo of her the morning she disappeared, appearing playful which followed her parents and friends' perception of nothing out of the ordinary

On Tuesday and Wednesday, a search of waterways, ponds and reservoirs in the Morgan Hill area came up empty.

Cardoza
said the sheriff's dive team searched the Calero, Chesbro and Uvas 
reservoirs, as well as the percolation ponds in the Morgan Hill and 
southern Santa Clara County areas. Earlier, crews had searched the 
pastures and gullies of Coyote Valley with the same fruitless results.

Sheriff's
deputies, FBI agents and other law enforcement officials have spent 
3,500 hours on the search. More than 600 tips have poured in.

More than 1,000 volunteers have joined
in searches led by the KlaasKids Foundation. 
The searches began Tuesday, and will continue 
through to Sunday at the very least.

Growing concern: Clothes belonging to Sierra Lamar have been found after the teenager went missing 12 days ago from her home in Morgan Hill, California

The law enforcement response has 
included searching the homes of neighbors, contacting registered sex 
offenders, interviewing friends and relatives, and stopping drivers who 
travel the road where Sierra picked up the bus and where her phone and 
purse were found to ask if they saw anything unusual.

Marlene LaMar told investigators she last saw her daughter when she left for work about 6am on March 16.

Just before 6:30am, when Sierra 
ordinarily got ready for school, the teenager tweeted. A friend received
a routine text message from her about 40 minutes later, the time she 
usually left home to catch the bus, authorities said.

But investigators have not found anything to signal where to look now.

The MacBook she got for her birthday 
has not provided any hints about where she might be. The night before 
she disappeared, she tweeted that she planned to write a school essay 
about teen depression and suicide. That same week, she tweeted: 
'suiiiiicide im tooo aliiiiive kill ya sellf.'

Sierra and her mother have been living
in Morgan Hill since October. Tonya Miller, a family friend, said 
Sierra appeared to have adjusted to the move, briefly joining a private 
cheerleading club and befriending the daughter of her mother's 
boyfriend.

The sheriff's department said neither Mrs LaMar nor her boyfriend is considered a suspect.

Authorities also absolved Sierra's 
father, Steve LaMar, a registered sex offender convicted in 2009 of one 
count of lewd or lascivious conduct with a child under 14. The victim 
was not Sierra or her older sister. Police say he is cooperating in the 
investigation and is not a suspect.

'I'm not going to hide it. It is very important they interview me, I get cleared and cooperate with everything,' LaMar said.

The night before Sierra went missing, 
she asked her father to make an appointment to get her hair highlighted.
He said he texted her the next day to say he had, but never got a 
reply.

When investigators reported finding 
the phone, Steve LaMar said, 'That was pretty disturbing because we know
that she is 15 years old and she loved that phone and was always on it.
We would get mad at her for being on it at dinner.'

Sierra is 5-feet-2 with a thin build, dark hair and an olive complexion.
