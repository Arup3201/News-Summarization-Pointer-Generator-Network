A man has been jailed for 10 years after stabbing his friend to death when he offended him over a Lionel Richie song.

Corey Thomas, 19, was offended when Andrew Male, 45, mocked the song Love, Oh Love, then turned it off because it had been played at his grandfather's funeral.

Cardiff Crown Court heard Thomas then flew into a rage and killed Male in January this year.

Prosecutor Huw Evans said: 'The song had a significant effect on Thomas because it was played at his grandfather's funeral.

'Mr Male made derogatory remarks about the song and he changed the CD and called him "kiddo".

'Thomas was offended about being spoken to in this way. He hit him, picked up a knife from the kitchen and stabbed him.'

The court heard Thomas stabbed his victim 18 times across his body and face and nearly cut his ear in half.

Jailed: Thomas (pictured at an earlier hearing) was sentenced to life after admitting murder

Focus of row: Soul singer Lionel Richie

The pair had been listening to hits compilation 'Back to Front' at the home of Mr Male, 45, in Aberdare, South Wales.

Cardiff
 Crown Court heard they had been drinking beers while playing the CD, 
which features hits such as Hello, All Night Long and Dancing on the 
Ceiling.

When album track 
Love, Oh Love came on, it was mocked by Mr Male, prompting drunken 
Thomas to used an 4ins kitchen knife to stab Mr Male 'multiple times'.

Afterwards, Thomas went to his sister's house and told her he had gotten into a row about a Lionel Richie CD.

Cardiff Crown Court heard Thomas was arrested shortly after the attack in January this year.

He said to officers: 'I just murdered someone. Ha ha ha! I just murdered someone and laughed about it.

'Why did I have to go and kill him for? He was taking the p*** out of my grandfather.'

Thomas, of Aberdare, pleaded guilty to murder. He was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 10 years and 10 months.

Judge Eleri Rees said drink had a 'profound effect' on his behaviour.
