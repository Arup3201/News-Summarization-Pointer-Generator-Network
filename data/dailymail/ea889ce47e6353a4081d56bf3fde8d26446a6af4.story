Two ants appear to hold hands and dance together in this perfectly timed photograph.

The insects glow crimson as they appear to grasp each other's hands on top of a mossy rock.

The creatures were shot by freelance architect Rhonny Dayusasono in the back garden of his home in East Java, Indonesia - who managed to capture the moment after 150 attempts.

This perfectly timed photograph captures the moment two ants appear to hold hands and start dancing

Bathed in brilliant sunlight, the insects glow crimson as they take each others hands on top of a mossy rock and set themselves for a romantic rhumba

It took him more than two hours before finally catching this perfect picture.

The 36-year-old said: 'It's such an exciting photograph because I've been shooting ants in my back garden for a few years but never captured a perfect moment like this.'

The red ant, known in Indonesia as the
 Rang-Rang, lives in colonies where each has their own role as either 
worker, drone or queen.

The colony is so important to the creatures that they would sacrifice themselves to protect their home.

They were shot by freelance architect Rhonny Dayusasono in the back garden of his home in East Java, Indonesia. He took more than 150 images over a period of two hours before finally catching this perfect picture

There are more than 11,000 species of ant in the world, the red ant is the most common and can be found in most gardens.

This particular species has a sting and, although small in size, it can be quite painful.

The red ant prefers sweet food - it is particularly fond of nectar and a 'honeydew' substance secreted by aphids.
