Wolfsburg and Borussia Monchengladbach both boosted their Champions League ambitions with victories on Sunday.

The Wolves look guaranteed of qualification for Europe's top competition as a 3-0 win at home to Freiburg strengthened their hold on second place, behind runaway leaders Bayern Munich.

Former Chelsea playmaker Kevin de Bruyne put Wolfsburg ahead in the 19th minute, but the result was in the balance until Ricardo Rodriguez added a second from the penalty spot with 12 minutes to go.
