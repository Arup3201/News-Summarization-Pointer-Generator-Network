For many people diagnosed with cancer, losing their hair is one of their biggest fears and often one of the most upsetting parts of the illness.

And for Laura Price, who lost her hair, eyebrows and eyelashes after chemotherapy, it was no less painful.

Diagnosed with breast cancer at just 29 and determined to stay positive, she decided to turn the experience into a project to track her hair growing back.

Laura Price was diagnosed with breast cancer at just 29 and required chemotherapy, which caused her hair to fall out. She is pictured right just after she shaved her head and before her eyebrows fell out 

Every day for the last 18 months, she has taken a photo of herself using an app to track her hair growth.

Beginning
 three months after chemotherapy finished, she went make-up free in each
 one to assess the progress of her eyelashes and eyebrows.

Now,
 two years to the week of her diagnosis, she has created a timelapse 
video of the pictures, charting her progression from looking like a 
'baby chick' to sporting a pixie crop.

It
 is a far cry from the long, brown hair she used to have. But cancer, 
she says, 'forces you to get used to a new normal where image is 
secondary'.

'That’s not to say that my vanity has gone out the window, but it does mean I’m delighted with my new pixie-do, even though I have a bald patch,' she said.

'As much as I envy women with beautiful, long hair, I’m just grateful to have my health.'

Writing on her blog, she said: 'Being bald hasn't exactly been the best thing to ever happen to me, but 
it certainly is liberating.

'You can take your wig off when you get too 
hot, you can have a totally different look every single day, and you 
save a fortune on shampoo and conditioner (though it doesn't quite 
offset the money doled out on expensive wigs...).

'The slight bald patch on the top of my head might never go away, but I'm content with what I've got.'

Miss Price, a journalist, was diagnosed with cancer in June 2012, a month before her 29th birthday. 

'I discovered the lump in February while on holiday in Brazil and as soon as I got to Argentina, I had a 
mammogram and ultrasound,' she said.

'Doctors 
determined it was a 
fibroadenoma – a harmless lump with smooth edges that moves around.

'They
 told me it was nothing to be concerned about, but I could
 get it double checked when I got home.

'The lump was an inch big and felt like a small golf 
ball, but it never caused me any pain or discomfort.'

But four 
months later, having moved to Ireland, an ultrasound detected something 
unusual and she was sent for further tests, including another mammogram,
 
ultrasound and biopsy, where a needle 
was inserted to take a tissue sample.

Days later she received the devastating news the lump was cancer.

She said: 'As much as I envy women with beautiful, long hair, I’m just grateful to have my health'

Within a month, she had undergone life-saving surgery to completely remove the tumour from her left breast. 

But she still required six months of chemotherapy and two of radiation - with the first meaning she would lose her hair.

'The truth is that losing your hair to chemotherapy is entirely different to shaving it off à la Brit popstar Jessie J,' she said recently.

Some people having cancer treatment find that it doesn’t affect their 
hair at all.

But patients having chemotherapy often experience hair thinning or lose it completely.

Hair
 follicles are normally destroyed during chemotherapy because like 
cancer tumours, they are made up of rapidly growing cells.

This is why 
chemotherapy can lead to hair loss, although it is almost temporary

Radiotherapy to the head always causes some hair loss.

'For almost a year after my first chemo treatment, I had to get
 used to the double takes and pitying glances.

'Despite the occasional 
ignorant remark – like the man who shouted 'chemo!' at me while I was 
walking down the street – people were kind and reassuring about my 
baldness. 

'Firstly,
 you have the emotionally painful experience of waiting for your hair to
 fall out.

'Secondly, it stops growing from below the root, so you end up
 with a polished egg look, rather than a stubbly rock chick one.

'The 
worst thing, though, is losing your eyebrows – often the defining part 
of a face and the slowest thing to grow back.

'A year after finishing 
chemo, mine are still a shadow of their former bushy, caterpillar-like 
selves.'

But she says the fear of losing her hair again never leaves her - and she constantly touches her head to check it is still there. 

She admits she looks 'completely different' to 18 months ago - but is unphased by it.

'As much as I envy women with beautiful, long hair, I’m just grateful to have my health.

'My haircut isn’t a fashion statement or a choice. It’s a side effect of the treatment that saved my life.'
