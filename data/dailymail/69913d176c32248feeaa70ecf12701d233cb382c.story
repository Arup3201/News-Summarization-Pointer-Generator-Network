For most dogs, going for walks on grass, chewing on bones and eating dog food are part of daily life.

But for Ruby the black Labrador this isn't the case - because she is allergic to being a dog.

The three-year-old, from Edinburgh, has allergies to meat, milk, dust mites and some types of grass.

Allergic to life: Ruby the Labrador, pictured with her 27-year-old owner Karen Stanfield, is allergic to being a dog

She is forced to eat homemade vegetarian meals instead of normal dog food - and even takes the drug Piriton to keep her sneezing and spluttering at bay.

She is also required to jump in lakes, rivers and puddles to wash off stray blades of grass every time she ventures outdoors.

Ruby's owner Karen Stanfield, 27, who keeps her house spotlessly clean for her pet's sake, said: 'People are always wondering what I feed my dog and when I explain they say: "How can a dog be allergic to all the things that dogs normally love?".

'But it’s just like people, some are lactose intolerant, some have to have gluten free food. My dog is allergic to dog food.'

Ruby’s unusual allergies emerged last year when she began suffering from constant stomach upsets, sneezing and fatigue.

Unlike a normal 18-month-old Labrador puppy, she refused to play or go for walks and started to lose weight, despite eating all the food she was given.

Ms Stanfield, a dog trainer and owner of Karen's Dogs, was mystified and tried everything from dog treats to coaxing Ruby out on walks to try to get her back to her usual self.

It was only when Ruby's vet carried out an Avacta sensitest, a special blood test for allergies specifically designed for pets, that her owner found allergies were the cause of her problems.

Following diagnosis, Ruby was placed on a strict vegetarian diet, excluding dog food and bones.

Now, Ms Stanfield cooks food from scratch every day to make sure no allergens contaminate the meals, as well as hoovering her house from top to bottom to ensure dust mites can’t thrive.

The owner, who now has Ruby's allergies under control, said: 'At first I thought she had an infection - she was always itchy, she had no energy and she struggled to go out for walks.

'She didn’t want to play and had a stomach upset solidly for three months. She only weighed 55lbs but she lost 15lbs.

'You could see all of her ribs - it was like I wasn’t feeding her even though I was trying desperately to keep her healthy. She looked like a neglected dog, as if she was starving, and I couldn’t find the cause.

'Even though I’m a positive reinforcement dog trainer I couldn’t work out why Ruby was so lethargic and unhappy. She was miserable and so was I.

'It wasn’t until Ruby’s vet did the sensitest that we realised it was allergies causing all her problems.'

She added: 'Ruby ate vegetarian food for a year and I’ve just started reintroducing turkey and pork back into her diet as she’s not allergic to those.'
