For years, the extra wide pavement outside Our Lady and St Hubert has provided an unofficial parking area for disabled parishioners during services.

But for zealous traffic wardens, it appears nothing is sacred – not even wheelchair-bound parishioners attending Sunday mass.

As the churchgoers emerged on Sunday morning they were appalled to find wardens slapping £50 tickets on their cars.

Row: A traffic warden puts a ticket on a car as an old woman protests outside Our Lady and St Hubert church in Oldbury, West Midlands

Anger: Some churchgoers were seen arguing with the traffic wardens for up to half an hour after church

Rule change: The road has recently been turned into a red route, but the vicar said that they have not been consulted about the change

Row: The warden slaps another ticket on a car outside the road - to the anger of parishoners

The parishioners – many elderly and 
some in wheelchairs – spent half an hour pleading to have the fines 
overturned, but the wardens showed no mercy.

They swooped shortly before mass 
ended at the Catholic church in Warley, West Midlands – even though one 
parishioner had earlier told a different pair of wardens that blue badge
holders were permitted to park there.

The wardens were spotted by a passing
photographer as they ticketed up to eight vehicles. The photographer 
said all but one of the cars clearly displayed the blue badge that 
indicates a disabled driver.

Outrage: A church-goer remonstrates with a traffic warden outside St Hubert Church in Oldbury

Anger: The road the church is down has recently been made into a red route so the cars are no longer allowed to park

Swoop: The parking wardens put tickets on around five or six cars outside the church

Anger: Mary Docker, 59, with her two grandchildren, Lilly Field, three (centre), and her sister Ruby, seven. She had a parking ticket put on her vehicle outside the church

Churchgoer Mary Docker, 59, who has 
multiple sclerosis, said she arrived at church to find the first pair of
wardens waiting to dish out tickets. They are thought to have left 
without issuing any fines. But later the second pair arrived.

Mrs Docker, a former councillor, 
said: ‘I told [the first wardens] the church had special dispensation 
for disabled parking. But when I came out there was a ticket on my car.

‘It’s so unfair, and mean. I can’t 
walk any great distance and I worry that I might not be able to continue
attending the church where I’ve been going for many years.’ The church 
is set back from crossroads between the main Wolverhampton and 
Bleakhouse roads.

Parish priest Father Peter Blundell 
said the local highways department told him five years ago that 
worshippers could park on the pavement as long as there was still room 
for pedestrians.

He believes wardens targeted the area
after the council extended the Wolverhampton Road red route to include 
the stretch past the church  three weeks ago, turning this section of 
road into a clearway.

He said: ‘We had no consultation on 
the change and no notification. If parishioners can’t park outside it 
means disabled people will have to leave their cars far away. If the 
council refuses to budge I worry I might not see some of them again.’

Anger: Reverend Peter Blundell, 70, pictured outside Our Lady and St Hubert church in Oldbury, said there was no consultation before the road was turned into a red route

Parking row: The red lines - which mean no stopping - can be seen on the road outside Our Lady and St Hubert church in Oldbury

Councillor Maria Crompton, of 
Sandwell council, said the matter would be investigated, adding: 
‘Regulations do state that where red lines have been painted on the road
the traffic regulations include the footpath.

‘There is an appeals process which allows drivers to state their case and each one will be considered on its own merits.

‘Hopefully this will resolve  the problem.’
