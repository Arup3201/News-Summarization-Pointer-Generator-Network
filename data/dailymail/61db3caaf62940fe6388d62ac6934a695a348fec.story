The wife of hate preacher Abu Hamza should be evicted from her taxpayer-funded £1million council house, her local MP said last night.

Hamza's second wife Moroccan-born Najat Mostafa, 53, has lived in the five-bedroom property for more than 15 years, bringing up the couple's eight children.

But most of them have now moved out, with just two living there according to neighbours in west London.

The former imam at the Finsbury Park mosque, who has been in custody since 2004, was extradited to America for trial last Friday.

Tomorrow he faces a hearing in New York to answer charges of terrorist activities in the U.S. and Yemen.

Greg Hands, the Conservative MP for Fulham and Chelsea, told The Daily Telegraph: 'I would strongly welcome any move by the council to take a look at Hamza's wife's status and the large council house in one of London's wealthiest neighbourhoods to see whether something might be done to move Hamza's family on.'

One of the family's neighbours is former Labour cabinet minister John Hutton while others include bankers and television producers.

Hamza, who is missing boths 
hands and an eye, never officially lived in the Shepherd's Bush house but was often seen there by neighbours before his arrest in August 2004 for incitement to murder and racial hatred.

In 2006 he was jailed for seven years. His wife moved into it in 1995 after claiming they had separated.

Police raided his council-owned house in 2004 and found thousands of extremist video and audio tapes ready for distribution.

In 2006 it emerged he had bought a four-bedroom semi in Greenford for £220,000 cash while in prison.

At the same time the Islamist extremist was running up a legal aid bill which had then cost the taxpayer £250,000, and the property was later seized to  claw back some of the cash.

Neighbours said Mrs Mostafa barely spoke to anyone in the street and never stopped to speak to people living there.

Hamza
faces 11 charges in the U.S., that include conspiring with Seattle men to set up a 
terrorist training camp in Oregon and helping abduct 16 hostages, two of
them American tourists, in Yemen in 1998.

If found guilty the 55-year-old is likely to die behind bars.

The
Islamist fanatic lost the last of his countless appeals in a legal 
farce that has seen him thwart extradition for more than eight years at a
cost to taxpayers of millions of pounds.
