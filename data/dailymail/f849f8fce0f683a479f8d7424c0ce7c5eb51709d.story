Timebomb: Experts warned that increased life expectancy could push the NHS and state pension system to the brink of collapse

Welfare spending has not been cut since the general election – despite David Cameron’s promise to do so – due to Britain’s ageing population.

Experts warned that increased life expectancy could push the NHS and state pension system to the brink of collapse.

Mr Cameron became Prime Minister after pledging to cut the amount of cash going towards benefits. But according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, little has changed three years on.

The OECD found that almost a quarter of the UK economy is still consumed by social welfare.

In 2010, when Labour lost power, some 23.8 per cent of gross domestic product went on ‘public social spending’, the organisation said.

The proportion fell slightly in 2011 – but by the next year it had increased to 23.9 per cent. The OECD said the current figure is 23.8 per cent – the same proportion as in the year of the election.

The think-tank said spending has in large part remained static because the Government has not reduced pensions and other benefits for the older generations, at a time when the number of elderly people is rising. High unemployment has also been a factor.

In an attempt to rein in spending, the Coalition has announced a cap on the amount households can receive in benefits. But the OECD figures will add to Conservative backbenchers’ demands for more to be done to cut the welfare bill.

They claim it is unfair that departments such as defence and education have endured deep cuts, while welfare spending has not been similarly reduced.

Economist Willem Adema warned that debates over cutting pensions ‘will not go away’ as the population ages.

Willem Adema, senior economist at the 
OECD, said that an ageing population was a major factor for the figures,
which cover spending on unemployment and housing benefit, state 
pensions, and the NHS budget.

He also blamed the previous Labour government’s decision to increase family tax credits, and ‘relatively slow’ economic growth that has seen many people continue to require income support.

Mr Adema warned that debates over cutting pensions ‘will not go away’ as the population ages. ‘Governments are wary of cutting pensions and benefits of those who are currently in retirement, so a lot of reforms are intended to increase retirement ages,’ he said.

A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘Our welfare reforms are helping to bring the benefits bill under control.

‘Many of the changes that will bring significant savings, like the cap on annual benefit increases, only began this April and therefore will generate savings further down the line.’
