Upsetting: The family of murdered honeymooner Michaela McAreavey, right, have been left outraged after a Mauritian newspaper today published pictures of her body following her death. She is pictured with husband John on their wedding day

The family of murdered honeymooner Michaela McAreavey have been left outraged after a Mauritian newspaper today published pictures of her body following her death.

The country’s Sunday Times, a paper with no connection to any British or Irish company, used crime scene photographs of the hotel room where Mrs McAreavey was killed.

Irish Taioseach Enda Kenny and Stormont Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness have also condemned the publication.

The newlywed was killed while on honeymoon with her husband John at the Legends Hotel in Mauritius in January last year.

Last week, two men were acquitted of her murder after an eight-week trial.

A statement from members of the couple’s family said: 'As the families struggle to come to terms with the result from the trial - this action by the newspaper is not only insensitive to their grief but marks another low in the treatment of John, the two families and the dignity of Michaela.'

Around 12 black and white images of the crime scene were published today in the newspaper.

On the front page there is a photograph of Mrs McAreavey taken after her death - under the headline 'Exclusive'.

Inside there are more images of the crime scene, including the hotel room and the bathroom.

There are also close-up pictures of Mrs McAreavey’s injuries.

John McAreavey and other members of the 27-year-old Irish newlywed's family stormed straight out of court on Thursday when the foreman of the jury declared Avinash Treebhoowoon and Sandip Moneea not guilty after just two hours of deliberations.

The men were hotel workers at the exclusive beachside complex on the paradise island of Mauritius where Mrs McAreavey, from Ballygawley, County Tyrone, in Northern Ireland, was found strangled in a bathtub.

Their acquittal now leaves the family again searching for answers over just who killed her.

Mr Kenny said: 'The publication of 
these images represents an appalling invasion of privacy and is a gross 
affront to human dignity.

'There are issues of fundamental human rights in question in relation to this deeply upsetting matter.

'This
reprehensible act can only add to the pain and suffering of the 
McAreavey and Harte families and our thoughts and sympathies are again 
with them at this time.

'On behalf of the people of Ireland, the Government will be lodging a formal complaint in the strongest possible terms, with the government of Mauritius.'

Mr McGuinness said the photographs had come from within the Mauritian system.

Angry: Irish Taioseach Enda Kenny, left, and Stormont Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, right, have  condemned the publication of the images

'Just when it seems the system in Mauritius cannot heap any more pain and anguish on to the McAreavey and Harte families, a local newspaper publishes pictures of Michaela’s body,' he said.

'The decision of the newspaper in Mauritius to publish crime scene photographs, including pictures of Michaela’s body is an outrageous abuse that cannot be justified in any way,' he said.

'People in Mauritius need to realise that the eyes of the international community are firmly focused on their country and their justice system in the wake of the brutal murder of Michaela and the absolute failure to deliver justice for John McAreavey and the rest of family.

'This case will not simply go away as some in Mauritius seem to hope. I can assure the Mauritian authorities that people in Ireland will continue to keep a focus on this case until justice is done.'

The McAreavey and Harte families’ statement added: 'The Mauritian authorities need now to match their words with actions and ensure that insensitive reporting by newspapers within their jurisdiction does not further exacerbate the violation of Michaela and the hurt to John.'
