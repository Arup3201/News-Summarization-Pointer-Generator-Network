Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds are said to be the proud parents of a bouncing baby girl.

The 27-year-old actress gave birth at a hospital near their home in Bedford, New York, just before the New Year, Page Six reported on Monday. 

The baby's sex and name were not known, but now a message of congratulations from a woman who claims to work at Westchester Medical Center seems to have let the details slip.

The message from @kimbanksy read: 'Congrats @blakelively #blakelively glad to have you and baby girl violet in our care.'

Baby joy! Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds - pictured here together in New York on 20 October last year- have welcomed their first child 

The tweet, first picked up by Page Six, could not be immediately verified. 

MailOnline reached out to Blake's representative for comment but did not receive an immediate response. 

According to a previous report in UsWeekly, Ryan, 38, who married Blake in 2012 following 11 months of dating, had been helping to ensure his stunning spouse enjoyed a care-free pregnancy.

Letting slip? This Twitter user, who claims to work at Westchester Medical Center, posted this message on Tuesday

The insider told the publication: 'Ryan is being such a sweet hubby, he's giving her foot and back rubs constantly! He jokes that she doesn't even have to ask anymore, he just automatically does it.'

The former Gossip Girl star recently gushed about how devoted her husband is.

She said: 'He's always good to me. That's like a jerky thing to say because you want to be able to complain about your husband and be that person, but he takes pretty good care of me.'

She also told UsWeekly that becoming a mother was something that she had 'always wanted' from an early age.

She said: 'Its something that I've always wanted ever since I was a little girl'

Adding: 'I knew I wanted to have a lot of kids because I had come from a big family so it was always important to me. So it’s just the excitement of that finally being here.' 

Blake has been documenting her pregnancy on her new lifestyle website Preserve.

That's some maternity style! Blake - pictured here on 12 December - certainly dressed her bump in a series of fun outfits 

Revealing the pregnancy news by showing off a bump picture on the site, the actress also posted shots from her baby shower.

She has also referred to the website as her 'baby' saying: 'It's definitely a baby for a reason. It's been the greatest learning experience I've had.'

'It's so empowering to have a profession that I control,' Lively said. "I'm responsible for success or failure and that responsibility is one that I really appreciate.'

Interestingly, Blake has yet to comment on her official Instagram page.

However, on Monday she posted a picture of a pillow that she made, and thanked her followers for compliments she received for the design.
