Michael Carrick has started the last six games for Manchester United and they have won every one. That is not a coincidence.

He is so versatile and experienced and his calming influence is helping the rest of the team. He is a good, honest player and he doesn’t try to overcomplicate things — all he has is a nasty habit of passing to his own team-mates!

But it’s not just that he takes the easy option every time. He is always looking to pass it forward and get his attacking players on the ball in dangerous positions.

When he and Daley Blind are both fit, I would still pick Carrick ahead of the Dutchman, purely because he looks to pass forward more often.

David de Gea had another excellent game between the sticks for United and Juan Mata scored one and set up another. People criticise Mata for not having an impact in the biggest games, but you couldn’t fault him on Sunday.

Yes, he got lucky with his goal, which he scored from an offside position, but his assist for Robin van Persie’s strike was superb. 

No other player on the pitch would try a pass as cute as that. It was a Mata moment of magic.
