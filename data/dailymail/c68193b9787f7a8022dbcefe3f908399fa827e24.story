Rachel Burke, 28, was scheduled to spend three weeks in Nepal on the hiking holiday which had been branded as ¿high risk¿

A super fit Naval worker who died on an adventure trip through a notorious ‘Valley of Death’ in the Himalayas was so sick she was unable to tie her own shoelaces, an inquest heard today. 

Rachel Burke, 28, was scheduled to spend three weeks in Nepal on the hiking holiday which had been branded as ‘high risk’ by the UK based The Adventure Company. 

She flew into Kathmandu with two friends on 15 April, 2011 and began to travel on foot to base camp Mount Everest, Southwark Coroner’s Court was told. 

Miss Burke began to show signs of possible altitude sickness and was struggling to keep up with the group as they trekked through the Gokoyo Valley, which has been nicknamed the ‘Valley of Death’. 

Her hand-eye co-ordination had failed and she was left unable to tie her shoelaces.

She was breathless and coughing and her lips were tinged with purple. 

On the sixth day of the hike she was taken on foot partway back down the mountain and died the following day, April 23, in Dole, Kathmandu. 

Kelly Morgan, a friend who joined Miss Burke on the hike, said that after days of trekking in the sun, the trip became dramatically tougher.

‘We were exhausted arriving at Dole,’ she said. 

The following day, on April 21, Miss Burke began to lag behind the group, struggling to reach the next check point at Machermo 90 minutes behind with ‘a tinge of purple’ to her lips. 

‘We did notice that her lips looked a little purple and I asked her how she was going.

‘With Rachel’s good spirits she replied "I’m fine".

‘We were all a little breathless.’ 

At this point the group had reached an altitude of 4,470 metres and the nights had grown ‘very cold’. 

‘She said she wasn’t feeling very well and that is when we decided that we needed to tell Ashok (the guide) and we thought that she shouldn’t continue,’ Ms Morgan said.

‘None of us had slept very well last night so she was tired and lethargic with a tinge of purple, she still had the cough and generally felt unwell. 

‘I had a cough, I felt tired but Rachel was worse than us. 

‘She had lost her spirit which was unusual for Rachel,’ she said.

‘Every other morning she had been able to tie up her shoelaces and pack, we didn’t notice initially. ‘It wasn’t until we went back to have something to eat that we noticed that her shoelaces were undone.’

Miss Burke agreed to descend the mountain and was last seen ‘walking into the distance’. 

That evening Ms Morgan and friend Becky Everest used a satellite phone to tell ‘a man in Kathmandu’ their friend’s insurance details and she was later pronounced dead. 

‘There was no way that you couldn’t notice her symptoms,’ said Ms Everest who confirmed that she had seen Miss Burke being given Diamox for her symptoms. 

Practices at The Adventure Company were put under the magnifying glass at the hearing as it transpired that she may have been left with an assistant not trained in altitude sickness after falling ill. 

Zoe Rebbeck-McAndrew was working as a health and safety executive at the company when they revised the risk assessment for the trip. 

‘I know that the tour leaders had all the five-day wildnerness training and all the assistant guides had AMS (acute mountain sickness) training as well,’ she said. 

‘You don’t look at the assistants?’ said Coroner Doctor Andrew Harris. 

‘I don’t, no,’ she replied. 

‘Is there a reason for drawing a line between the assistants and the guides?’ 

‘If someone was suffering from AMS, I would assume that the guide would go with them or they would be evacuated off the mountain.’ 

But Dr Harris said there was ‘some evidence that an assistant took Rachel’ after she became unwell. And Ms Rebbeck-McAndrew told the inquest that the tour brochure underestimated the height of the mountain at 3,780m prior to completing her assessment.

The trip, which included a 640-metre ascent in one day when the recommended distance is 300 metres ‘escaped my notice’, she said. 

‘There was no incidents that I had looked at, the trip was very well established when I picked it up so there was no changes to that (risk assessment),’ she explained. 

Paul Medley, national director, said that the company was not aware that there was a rescue post in the area Miss Burke died and said she was not taken for medical attention before she died. 

Miss Burke, of Orpington, Kent, had just completed a half marathon and played squash at least once a week. 

The inquest continues.
