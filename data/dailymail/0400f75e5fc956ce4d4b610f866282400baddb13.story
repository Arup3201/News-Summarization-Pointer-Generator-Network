The impact of a six-mile long 
asteroid believed to have hit the earth and wiped out the dinosaurs 66 
million years ago would have sparked a cataclysmic firestorm, scientists
 say.

Over the past three decades 
scientists have argued about what caused the extinction 66 million years
 ago - changes to climate, volcano activity or an asteroid.

Research has already shown that the 
prehistoric animals died out around the same time a six-mile long object
 hit the planet, and a new model of the disaster suggests the asteroid's
 impact would have sent vaporised particles of rock high above Earth's 
atmosphere which in turn would have turned the sky bright red as they 
heated the upper atmosphere to 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit on re-entry.

Cosmic explosion: An asteroid hitting the planet sounded the death knell of dinosaurs

A team from the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental 
Sciences have come up with a model of the disaster that shows how the 
asteroid's impact heated up the Earth's atmosphere to levels that would 
have incinerated anything not underground or underwater. (Impression of dinosaurs feeding)

'It's likely that the total amount of infrared heat was equal to a 1 
megaton bomb exploding every four miles over the entire Earth,' study 
researcher Douglas Robertson, of the Cooperative Institute for Research 
in Environmental Sciences, or CIRES, said in a statement reported in LiveScience.com.

To put this into perspective, a 1-megaton hydrogen bomb is said to be the 
equivalent of 80 Hiroshima-type nuclear bombs.

The model, detailed this week in the Journal of Geophysical 
Research-Biogeosciences shows how the 'heat pulse' 
would have incinerated the world's forests and everything else not 
protected underground or underwater.

The global firestorm theory has been aired before, with some scientists 
claiming that much of the intense radiation would have been shielded from Earth by the falling rock.

Factoring in this heat reduction, Roberts and his team maintain the 
atmosphere would still have been hot enough to ignite the world's 
forests.

The team's claim is bolstered by evidence of a layer of soot at the Earth's 65 million-year-old Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary which would be consistent with global fires.

Some scientists argue that the charcoal's presence is in fact from the impact of the asteroid itself - an argument countered by Robertson who says the asteroid alone would not have created quite this much.

'Our data show the conditions back then are consistent with widespread 
fires across the planet,' said Robertson.

'Those conditions resulted in 
100 per cent extinction rates for about 80 percent of all life on Earth.'

The asteroid's impact  near the town of Chicxulub 
in Mexico left a crater more than
 110 miles (180 kilometers) wide.

The explosion itself would have released as much energy as 100
 trillion tons of TNT, more than a billion times more than the atom 
bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

While
 the impact may not have been the sole cause of the dinosaur extinction,
 it almost definitely dealt the death blow, said researchers in February at Berkeley University's Geochronology Centre in California.

Director Paul Renne said: 'We have shown that these events are synchronous to within a gnat’s eyebrow.

'Therefore the impact clearly played a major role in extinctions, but it probably wasn’t just the impact. The impact was clearly the final straw that pushed Earth past the tipping point.'

The asteroid collision with Earth has now been dated to 66,038,000 years ago. The new extinction date is precise to within 11,000 years.

Before the cosmic explosion, many creatures 
were brought to the brink of extinction by dramatic climate swings in the 
preceding million years, including long cold snaps.

Researchers used 
 high-precision radiometric dating analysis of debris kicked up by the 
impact which would have radioactive materials within them.

The
 extinction of the dinosaurs was first linked to a comet or asteroid 
impact in 1980 by the late UC Berkeley Nobel Laureate Luis Alvarez and 
his son, Walter, who is a UC Berkeley professor emeritus of earth and 
planetary science.

The Colorado researchers maintain that the conditions resulted in 
100 per cent extinction rates for about 80 percent of all life on Earth
