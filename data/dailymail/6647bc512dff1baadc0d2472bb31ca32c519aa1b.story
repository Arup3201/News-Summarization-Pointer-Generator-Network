The U.S.-led coalition in the Middle East launched 11 air strikes against Islamic State targets today, hitting six targets in Syria and five in Iraq.

The raids in Syria focused on the contested city of Kobani near the Turkish border, destroying seven Islamic State fighting positions, a building and a tactical unit, the U.S. military said.

In Iraq the raids targeted Islamic State militants in the key cities of Tal Afar, Mosul and Ramadi, Reuters quoted officials as saying.

Today  U.S. officials said U.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State in Iraq have killed three of the militant group's top leaders but not senior commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Among those killed was Abd al Basit, whom the officials described as the group's military 'emir,' and Haji Mutazz, a deputy to Baghdadi. 

Those strikes took place between Dec. 3 and Dec. 9, they said.

They also confirmed last month's killing of Radwan Taleb al-Hamdouni, whom local medical sources had described to Reuters at the time as the radical militant group's leader in the northern city of Mosul.

News of the killings, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, came the same day the top U.S. commander of coalition efforts against the Islamic State, Lieutenant General James Terry, hailed the impact of four months of air strikes in Iraq.

'We've made significant progress in halting that (militant) offensive,' Terry told reporters.

He pointed to successful air strikes this week around Iraq's Sinjar Mountain and Zumar. 

Those strikes helped Kurdish peshmerga fighters fight their way to Sinjar mountain and, according to a Kurdish leader, free hundreds of people trapped there by Islamic State fighters.

At the same time, Terry outlined a long fight ahead, cautioning it would take several years to build necessary capabilities of Iraqi forces, who crumbled during the Islamic State's offensive this summer.  

Terry said the next wave of American troops will begin moving into Iraq in a couple of weeks to train local forces.

He said the challenge is to get Iraqi units trained and back into the fight so they can plan operations to regain contested areas such as Mosul.

He said that while there has been progress in halting the militants' charge across Iraq, 'I think what we must do, especially inside of Iraq, is continue to build those (Iraqi) capabilities. I think you're at least talking a minimum of three years.'

The Iraqi army wants to launch a counteroffensive to retake Mosul, the largest city in northern Iraq, and the U.S. likely would help. While there have been some concerns that Iraq's military may not be ready yet for such an ambitious operation, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said last week that the U.S. is working with senior Iraqi leaders on preparations.

'Part of the planning has to be how you generate force to do operations,' Terry told reporters during a briefing in the Pentagon. The question, he said, is 'how do you get into a place where you can generate some capability, pull some units back so that you can make them better, and then now start to put those against operations down the road.'

He declined to reveal when a Mosul operation might be launched. There have been fewer details and more limited media access to U.S. military operations in Iraq this time than during the eight years of war that ended in 2011. U.S. officials say it's because the military is there only to advise and assist the sovereign Iraqi government.

There are currently about 1,700 U.S. troops in Iraq, and President Barack Obama has authorized up to 3,000. More than 1,000 U.S. troops are expected to be deployed in the coming weeks to increase the effort to advise and assist Iraq units at the higher headquarters levels and also to conduct training at several sites around the country.

Terry also offered an optimistic view of the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government's progress in working more with the Sunni tribes.

The deep sectarian divide fueled the advances of the Islamic State militants across Iraq earlier this year as grievances led some align with the extremists. U.S. officials have stressed that ongoing coalition assistance hinges in part on whether the Iraqi government becomes more inclusive.

The U.S. and Iraqi governments have proposed creating a national guard program that would arm and pay tribesmen to fight. Terry said Thursday that as the Iraqis conduct more combat operations in Sunni strongholds such as Anbar, there will be more opportunities to bring tribal members into the fight.

He said the national guard effort is starting and that he is optimistic the Iraqi government will approve legislation needed for the program to move forward. 

Also today, a senior Kurdish official in Iraq said the peshmerga fighters battling Islamic State militants have managed to open up a corridor to Sinjar Mountain so that thousands from the Yazidi minority trapped there can flee.

Masrur Barzani says the Kurdish forces established the passageway Thursday, a day after launching the operation to retake the IS-held Sinjar, The Associated Press reported.

Tens of thousands of Yazidis became trapped in the mountain in early August, when the IS extremists captured the towns of Sinjar and Zumar, prompting the exodus. 

Many were eventually airlifted off the mountain or escorted by a passageway through Syria back into Iraq, to find refuge in the Iraqi Kurdish semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq, but thousands more came later and remained stuck on the mountain.

'Our hope is that all those people will eventually be able to go back to their own homes and villages and towns but those that are in need of evacuation now, a corridor has been opened to evacuate those people,' Mr Barzani told The Associated Press in Irbil, the Kurdish regional capital .

Yazidis follow an ancient religion with ties to Zoroastrianism.

The Kurdish forces, known also as peshmerga, said in September that they would focus on Sinjar after liberating the nearby towns of Rabia, Mahmoudiya and Zumar.
