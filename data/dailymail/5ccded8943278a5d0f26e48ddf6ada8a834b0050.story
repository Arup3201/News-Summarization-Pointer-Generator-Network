Koo Stark arrived at Isleworth Crown Court today armed with a £40,000 painting she was accused of stealing from her former partner

Koo Stark described yesterday how being locked in a police ‘cage’ after she was accused of theft had been her ‘worst nightmare’.

Prince Andrew’s former girlfriend was speaking after she handed back a £40,000 painting she was accused of snatching from Warren Walker.

She had been due to stand trial for allegedly taking the artwork from the home of Mr Walker, the father of her 16-year-old daughter Tatiana.

But a dramatic last-minute deal between lawyers saw the 57-year-old actress-turned-photographer cleared when she agreed to return the 17th century oil painting.

Her defence lawyer also said the expensive nature of the case had given rise to the ‘very real risk’ that Miss Stark would be left homeless and unable to provide a home for her daughter.

Miss Stark, who was accused under her real name Kathleen, had arrived at court yesterday with the painting wrapped in a green blanket and bubble wrap.

It was carried in a canvas shopping bag by her solicitor Jules Azzopardi who told security officials at Isleworth Crown Court: ‘Be careful, it’s very expensive.’

The 12in square artwork by the Dutch master Anthonie van Borssom was then examined by lawyers representing  Mr Walker in a consultation room next  to the court.

A photograph of the moonlit coastal  landscape – which was still in its frame – was then sent by text message to Mr Walker, who verified it was the one he claimed was his.

Once the handover was confirmed,  prosecutors offered no evidence against Miss Stark and His Honour Judge Andrew McDowall recorded a formal ‘not guilty’ verdict.

Miss Stark had claimed she believed the painting belonged to her when she took it from Mr Walker’s home in Kensington Park Gardens, London on July 21 last year.

But she became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute with Mr Walker, an American financier who had left her ten days before their 1997 wedding while she was heavily pregnant.

American-born Miss Stark yesterday said the ‘painful episode’, which included being locked in a police cell, was beyond her ‘worst nightmare’.

In a statement she said: ‘I have been cleared of a charge that should never have been brought against me. I leave court with my liberty and my good name, but it should never have come to this. I was a defendant charged with a serious crime. In my mind, I have been looking into a prison for the last ten months.

‘I have travelled through the criminal courts, a stranger in a strange land. When I was arrested I was even put into a cage – as they describe it at the police station. I have been vilified and put in the pillory. Fortunately, common sense has prevailed and my former partner has relented.’

Miss Stark struck a deal with prosecutors to hand back the Anthonie van Borssom oil painting of a moonlit coastal landscape to court to avoid trial

She added: ‘If someone like me can be arrested, bruised and locked in a police cage, an experience I never dreamed would happen in my life, then it could happen to anyone.’ Her relationship with Mr

Walker has been tempestuous since they separated in 1997 and she once threatened to sue him for ‘emotional distress’ after he appealed for custody of their daughter.

Miss Stark yesterday expressed hope that her dealings with Mr Walker might improve. However, in court Edward Henry, defending, claimed Mr Walker had ‘sought to criminalise the mother of his child unjustly, disproportionally and inappropriately’.

'Today I have been cleared of a charge that should never have been brought against me.

'I leave court with my liberty and my good name but it should never have come to this.

'I was a defendant charged with a serious crime. In my mind, I have been looking into a prison for the last ten months.

'I have travelled through the criminal courts, a stranger in a strange land.

'When I was arrested I was even put into a cage - as they describe it at the police station. I have been vilified and put in the pillory.

'Fortunately, common sense has prevailed and my former partner has relented.

'As Yeats once said, "Young we loved each other and were ignorant".

'I leave with the desire that from now on we will treat each other with respect and that any disputes we may have are dealt with in private and with dignity.'

He also said the case had given rise to the ‘very real risk’ that his client would be left homeless and unable to provide a home for her daughter.

Defence counsel applied for costs to be donated to the Bar Pro Bono fund which represented Miss Stark at court, but this was refused by the judge.

Judge McDowall said: ‘It is an unfortunate fact that for many years these parties have been locked in battle in the civil and family courts.

‘At the end of the day, the fact of the matter is if your client had acted through the civil courts, it would have been dealt with there and if she had not gone to the property and taken away the painting, this would never have happened.

‘If things had gone differently, we might have been here for days.

‘It was better to resolve this matter without running the risk of private personal matters being ventilated in court.’

Miss Stark, who did not qualify for legal aid, later appealed for more support for the Bar Pro Bono fund which had helped her through ‘this painful episode’.

Miss Stark met the Duke of York on a blind date during his leave from the Royal Navy and they began dating on his return from the Falklands War in 1982.

She was later invited to Balmoral to visit the Royal Family. The couple dated for 18 months before separating after it was revealed Miss Stark had appeared semi-naked in the soft porn film Emily.
