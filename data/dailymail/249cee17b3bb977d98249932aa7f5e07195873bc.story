A breakthrough in sustainable energy and car design has enabled a team of engineers to build the world's first solar powered family car.

The Dutch team have created the world's first 'energy positive' car, which means it produces more energy than it uses.

It also has enough room to seat a family of four.

A breakthrough in sustainable energy and car design has enabled a team of engineers to build the world's first solar powered family car

Using large solar panels that are placed on the roof of the car, 'Stella' can travel 250 miles without sunshine and on a sunny day, when fully charged, it can drive up to 420 miles.

This is nearly twice as far as a standard electric car can travel before it needs to be charged up.

Made with the latest in lightweight materials, such as high grade aluminium and carbon fibre, the car weighs a mere 380kg, 1120kg lighter than the average electrical car.

Team Manager, Lex Hoefsloot, at Eindhoven University of Technology, said: ‘Because the car is standing still 90 per cent of the time in front of your house or your office, we found out that in 10 out of the 12 months of the year, the car provided more energy than it uses.

‘The car also produces twice the amount of energy needed to drive normal distances and soon our car will be granted a licence plate by the Dutch authorities.

‘We strongly believe that the car of the future is much lighter, aerodynamic and more efficient.

‘Solar panels are the solution for a sustainable future, and they can increase the range of your car.

‘The car is still expensive because it is a prototype and it is hand-made, but when the production is scaled up, the car could be just as affordable as a normal family car.

‘The solar cells on the roof of the car cost only £2,600.

‘Our future designs will focus on making the car even more comfortable, practical and energy efficient, so in the end people have the feeling that they could buy a similar car at a dealership.’
