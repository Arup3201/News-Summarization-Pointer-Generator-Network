The woman with the world’s longest fingernails has not let her talons stop her from travelling as she hopped on a plane from LAX airport in California today.

Singer Chris ‘The Duchess’ Walton posed with the nails she stopped cutting 19 years ago, proudly placing her talons front and centre to show off the curling nails, coloured to match her outfit.

While known for her music in California and Nevada, she is arguably better known for her amazing dedication to her nails which were officially recognised by the 2012 edition of the Guinness Record Book.

Record holder: Chris 'The Duchess' Walton did not let her fingernails - the world's longest - stop her getting on a plane at LAX Airport in California today

With five children at home, the Las Vegas woman said she cooks and cleans with her nails and can even play the piano and use the computer with the nails which have an incredible combined length of 20 feet averaging about two-foot long each.

The 45-year-old said: 'It's just like growing a long beard, or long hair.

'I didn't grow my nails deliberately - I just stopped getting manicures and started taking care of my nails myself.’

What big nails you have: The 45-year-old woman stopped cutting her nails 19 years ago and they have grown to a combined length of 20 feet

She claims to have only lost a nail 
once, when fixing her car engine on the freeway, and otherwise has no 
trouble leading a normal life.

'Other people think I'm very fragile when they first meet me, but they soon see that I can do everything,' she said.

Walton strengthened the nails using acrylic on the outside and inside of her nails, and has grown used to them.

Walton said: 'Instead of clipping them back, I'd fill them in as they grew. I kept living and they kept growing.

'I think they got this long because I don't pay attention to them. I sometimes even forget they're there.

'If people are mean to me, I think that although I can cut my nails off, there are people born different that can't get away from their difference.

The previous record holder for the 
longest nails was Lee Redmond of Salt Lake City, Utah. Her nails 
measured a combined total 28 feet in 2008 but she lost her nails in a 
car crash in 2009 in which she sustained serious but non-life 
threatening injuries.

She started growing her nails in 1979 and had to care for the nails daily, soaking them in olive oil and cleaning them with a toothbrush.

And when, in previous interviews, she was asked the inevitable question about how she goes uses the bathroom, she replied: 'Very carefully'.

The record holder for the longest male fingernails is American Melvin Booth at 29ft 8in. He passed away in 2009.
