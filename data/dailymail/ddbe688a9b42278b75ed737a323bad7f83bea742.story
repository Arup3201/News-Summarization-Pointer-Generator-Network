The treatment of Gareth Bale in Spain suggests it is not just in the Premier League that foreign players can get a raw deal.

Bale’s form has dipped lately, but before that he scored vital goals — at a rate close to one every other game — and helped his team win their 10th European Cup.

The condemnation he receives from the local media and crowd, therefore, is mystifying. He is accused of not being a team player. Few in England would recognise that description.

It reminds of the scenes in Nicolas Roeg’s film The Man Who Fell To Earth, when alien Thomas Jerome Newton, played by David Bowie, is kept captive for investigation by government scientists. One of the tests alters his appearance for good. He looks at his tormentors sadly.

‘We’d have probably done the same to you, if you’d come round our place,’ he concludes.
