Heathrow's
 £2.5bn new Terminal 2 (T2) opens tomorrow with the first flight - a 
United Airlines service from Chicago - due to land just before 6am.

But
 due to the T5 debacle in March 2008, when one in five flights were cancelled
 and 28,000 suitcases went missing, Heathrow development director John 
Holland-Kaye and his team are opening T2 in stages.

United will be the only carrier to begin with and, for the first few days, T2 will only operate at 10 per cent of its total capacity.

There will be just 34 flights on the first day, with T2 having only to deal with 6,000 passengers.

By October, United will be joined by more than 20 other airlines, including Air China, Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa. Virgin’s domestic operation, Little Red, will also be using the new terminal.

When fully occupied, T2 will be home to 26 airlines and will have more than 330 flights a day to more than 50 destinations. 

Mr Holland-Kaye said, 'Opening a new terminal is one of the most complex challenges that any airport can undertake.'

'We can't guarantee that opening day will be perfect. 
There is a very high risk of things happening (on the first day) when 
you carry out a live operation for the first time.'

Gavin 
Hayes, director of the Let Britain Fly campaign, said: 'The opening of 
T2 is a cause for jubilation, demonstrating what can be achieved by 
private sector funding of nationally-significant infrastructure.

But
 he added, 'The refurbishing of an existing airport terminal at London’s
 busiest airport does little to relieve the huge pressure on UK aviation
 capacity...the UK is falling further behind international rivals 
because the industry cannot invest in urgently-needed runways.'

Officially
 named Terminal 2, The Queen’s Terminal, 
the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will officially open T2 on June 23.

heathrow 
bosses said that this time around they had 'sought advice from other 
airports around the world and learnt lessons from opening T5'.

Under the managership of the west London 
airport's development director John Holland-Kaye, the creation of T2 has
 been accompanied by numerous test runs involving thousands of 
volunteers.

More than 180 trials for T2 have taken place over the last six months involving 14,000 volunteers.

Extensive trials of the systems were carried out, with everything tested - from 
individual aspects of terminal operations, such as the check-in process,
 to large-scale trials that test the complete passenger journey

T2 replaces the old Terminal 2 at Heathrow which closed in 2009 after 54 years of service.

It
 boasts 60 check-in gates and 66 self-check-in kiosks, 29 security 
lanes, 33 shops, 17 restaurants, more than 7,000 seats, 634 toilets and 
42 water fountains. Facilities also include a John Lewis store and a Heston Blumenthal restaurant.

By
 the end of the year it will be handling passengers at the rate of 15.8 
million a year and it has been built to take up to 20 million a year.

shafts of natural light and high quality acoustics should make the building a calm space for travellers accustomed to high anxiety at dark, noisy airports, said lead architect Luis Vidal.

'You can never completely erase your memory of the former Terminal 2, because it was a dreadful experience. This will be completely the opposite. This will be a destination. People will want to come here,' he said.

The
 completion of the £2.5billion project is part of an £11billion 
refurbishment designed to keep London's biggest airport competitive with
 other major European hubs including Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris.

Causing a debate: The BBC's Question Time was broadcast from new terminal last week

Striking: The Slipstream sculpture is the centrepiece of the development, hanging 18m above the ground with a design intended to evoke the path of a plane in flight

Home to 25,000 staff, T2 is part of an 
overall project that includes not only the terminal building but also a 
1,712ft satellite pier, a 1,340-space car park, an energy centre and a 
cooling station.

It will host 26 airlines, including United, Air Canada, Singapore Airlines and others that are part of the global Star Alliance, and offer flights to 51 destinations.

Check-in will be large enough to 
accommodate 3,000 passengers an hour and an average of 55,000 passengers
 will arrive and depart a day. There will be more than 50 shops, as well
 as 17 bars and restaurants.

Officials say the terminal will be the 
first in the world to offer a 'complimentary personal shopping lounge 
where trained stylists will present a curated range of products for each
 client.'

The 
interior of the new terminal is dominated by a huge aluminium sculpture 
hanging 18m above the ground that is inspired by the flight path of a 
stunt place.

British
 artist Richard Wilson's 'Slipstream' weighs 77 tonnes and is 78m in 
length, its vast bulk looming above the terminal's main lobby and 
escalators, evoking the journeys that those who see it are set to embark
 on.

One of the features of the new terminal 
will be the ability of passengers to check in at any desk regardless of 
which airline they are travelling with.

Passengers will be able to 
take their meal on board from all the T2 restaurants and travellers are 
also being promised that there will be a selection of dishes guaranteed 
to be ready in 15 minutes.

Royal approval: The official name for the new site is Terminal 2 The Queen's Terminal

Future of travel: An average of 55,000 passengers will arrive and depart at the new terminal per day

Passengers have been warned to expect teething troubles at T2 this summer and the airport's bosses said the challenge of opening a new terminal should not be underestimated.

During the
 T5 fiasco in 2008, thousands of bags were sent astray while passengers 
faced long queues after problems delayed staff from getting to work.

'The chance of a completely smooth opening for any airport terminal in the world is low,' Heathrow's development director John Holland-Kaye said.

He added that even with immense pre-planning, there was the chance of a passenger 'turning left instead of turning right' on the terminal's opening day tomorrow.
