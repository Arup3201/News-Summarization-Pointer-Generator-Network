Chelsea have become the first club in the Barclays Premier League to adopt the national living wage and Luton Town have become the first in the Football League, too. 

The UK living wage is £7.85 an hour (but £9.15 in London) and will be the minimum level by which all staff at Chelsea and Luton will now be paid.

Luton have insisted they will not pass on any of the extra cost to the fans in terms of increased ticket or retail prices, despite becoming the first of the Football League's 92 to adopt such a policy.

Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck told their official website: 'As a responsible employer we are proud of this significant achievement for the club.

‘We believe the move to the Living Wage underlines our commitment to ensuring that all our employees receive a fair rate of pay for their hard work and dedication. Quite simply it is the right thing to do.’

David Lammy MP previously campaigned for Premier League sides in London to adopt the £9.15 level of the living wage. Following the announcement by Luton, Lammy tweeted his support.

He said: 'League 2 club with 1 of the smallest budgets becomes 1 of Eng's 92 pro clubs to commit to Living Wage. Puts bigger club to shame.' 

Luton, in a message on their official website, revealed: 'This (the living wage) applies to all contracted members of staff in all departments including football, retail, catering, maintenance and administration.

'The change to staff pay will be absorbed by the club and there will be no increases in ticket or retail prices as a result.'

The club are flying high in their first season back in the Football League, sitting second in League Two.

Scottish club Hearts have previously committed to adopt the living wage too.
