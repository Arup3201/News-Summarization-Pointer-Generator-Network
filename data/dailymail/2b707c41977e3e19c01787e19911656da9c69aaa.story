A judge has accepted James Holmes' plea of not guilty by reason of insanity - as the Colorado theater shooting suspect smirked and yawned his way through the hearing.

Holmes, who allegedly killed 12 theater goers and injured 70 more as they watched The Dark Knight Rises last July, looked indifferent as he followed the ground rules of the plea in court on Tuesday.

After Judge Carlos Samour Jr. read through the 18 points and asked Holmes if he had any questions, Holmes answered 'no' in a clear, firm voice.

Samour then accepted the plea, setting the stage for a lengthy mental evaluation of Holmes.

The judge also determined prosecutors can have access to a notebook that Holmes sent to a psychiatrist filled with violent drawings before last summer's rampage.

Holmes is charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder following the shootings in Aurora last summer, and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

The insanity plea is widely seen as 
Holmes' best chance of avoiding execution, and possibly his only chance,
given the weight of the evidence against him.

Holmes' lawyers repeatedly have said he is mentally ill, but they delayed the insanity plea while arguing state laws were unconstitutional. They said the laws could hobble the defense if Holmes' case should ever reach the phase where the jury decides if he should be executed.

The judge rejected that argument last week.

On Tuesday, Samour ordered Holmes to 
undergo a mental evaluation at the state hospital in Pueblo, as soon as 
the hospital is ready to conduct it.

But
evaluators want to review the 40,000 pages of evidence in the case 
first, so it's unclear when it will happen. Samour set a tentative 
deadline of August 2 for Holmes' evaluation.

Colorado law defines insanity as the inability to distinguish right from wrong caused by a diseased or defective mind.

If jurors find Holmes not guilty by 
reason of insanity, he would be committed indefinitely to the state 
mental hospital. He could eventually be released if doctors find his 
sanity has been restored, but that is considered unlikely.

If jurors convict him, the next step 
is the penalty phase, during which both sides call witnesses to testify 
about factors that could affect why Holmes should or shouldn't be 
executed.

The jury would then decide whether Holmes should be executed or sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.

If jurors impose the death penalty, it
would trigger court appeals and open other possibilities that would 
take years to resolve.

The hearing came as the court 
released dozens of pretrial motions filed by defense attorneys 
challenging the admissibility of ballistics, handwriting and mountains 
of other evidence.

The 
motions challenge the search and seizure of computers, a pistol from 
Holmes' car outside the theater, evidence taken from Holmes' 
booby-trapped apartment, emails and other items.

The motions also indicate the prosecution has as many as 3,000 witnesses, including FBI and Aurora officials, and demands that prosecutors hand over as many as 2,000 pieces of physical evidence.

They also signaled that Holmes will seek a change of venue because of pretrial publicity.

Lawyers also argued about whether 
prosecutors should have access to a notebook Holmes sent to psychiatrist
Lynne Fenton. Media reports have said the notebook contains violent 
drawings.

Defense lawyers 
argued Fenton never received the notebook so prosecutors shouldn't have 
access to it; prosecutors say police would like to do unspecified 
'additional processing' on the notebook.

Samour ordered the notebook to be turned over next week.

Victims: Six-year-old Veronica Moser, left, and 18-year-old AJ Boik, right, a popular musician and art student, were among the 12 people who lost their lives in the shooting last July

Hundreds of people were watching a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises at the Aurora theater July 20 when the shooting occurred.

The dead included a Navy veteran who threw himself in front of his friends to shield them, an aspiring sports journalist who had survived a mall shooting just two months earlier, and a six-year-old girl.

Prosecutors say Holmes spent months buying weapons, ammunition and materials for explosives and scouted the theater in advance. He donned police-style body armor, tossed a gas canister into the seats and opened fire, they say.
