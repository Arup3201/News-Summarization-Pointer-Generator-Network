Police launched an urgent search for Man Haron Monis's partner on the day of the Sydney siege after her mother reported her missing.

Amirah Droudis was a close associate and appeared in videos promoting his website and views.

Police located her after several hours.

Monis walked into the Lindt cafe in Sydney's busy Martin Place around 9.30am on Monday, pulled a shotgun from a bag and took 18 people hostage. The siege ended in a hail of gunfire almost 17 hours later when police stormed the cafe. Two hostages and Monis died.

Man Haron Monis's partner, Amirah Droudis, shared his extremist views 

Droudis had acted as Monis's spokesperson for many years, delivering YouTube messages on behalf of the self-declared sheikh.

In one video uploaded in 2009, a niqab-clad ‘Sister Amirah’ proclaims she is a terrorist.

After the siege came to its devastating end in the early hours of Tuesday morning, riot police raided the Belmore home in Sydney's southwest where Droudis had been living.

On the morning of the siege Ms Droudis had been reported missing by her mother 

Ms Droudis is on bail charged with murdering Monis's ex-partner Noleen Pal in 2013.

He was charged with being an accessory to the murder of Ms Pal, who was stabbed and had her body set alight.

9News reported that on Friday she reported to police as part of her bail conditions today. Her 14-year-old daughter was with her. She reported to Campsie Police Station as she has done for more than 12 months now. Ms Droudis continued to make no comment or show any remorse.
