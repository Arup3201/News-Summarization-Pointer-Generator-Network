The 80,000 crowd at Wembley were joined by familiar faces as celebrities turned out for Carl Froch and George Groves II.

Among those at ringside was football pundit Jamie Redknapp, TV chef Gordon Ramsey, England cricket captain Alastair Cook and former British boxer Frank Bruno.

The rematch, fighting for the super-middleweight title, has been fuelled by a war of words between Froch and Groves, and certainly caught the imagination of some well-known figures.
