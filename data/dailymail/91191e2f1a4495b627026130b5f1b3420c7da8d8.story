Mark Robins has emerged as a major contender for the Blackpool manager’s post as chairman Karl Oyston continues his search to replace Jose Riga.

Sportsmail understands that Oyston met with the former Huddersfield Town boss late on Monday afternoon. Blackpool declined to comment when contacted.

Robins left the Terriers after their opening day Championship mauling by Bournemouth but is keen to get back into management quickly.

And that even extends to shipwrecked Blackpool, who have become the basket case of the Football League.

Oyston has courted Burton Albion boss Gary Rowett and Owen Coyle in recent weeks, both spurning the opportunity to take over.

Riga’s future at Bloomfield Road has looked bleak for the last six weeks, with Oyston beginning the search for his eventual successor at the beginning of August.

The Belgian has a broken relationship with his employers after major disagreements over transfer policy and the club’s training facilities.

Riga will not resign however, leaving Oyston with the task of trying to find a new man while still having one in the job.

Blackpool host Watford on Tuesday and Riga will take charge. They picked up their first point of the season against Wolves at the weekend.
