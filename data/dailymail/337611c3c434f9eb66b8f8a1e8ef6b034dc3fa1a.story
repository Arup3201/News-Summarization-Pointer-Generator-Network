The leader of Greece's extreme right Golden Dawn party was arrested this morning on charges of forming a criminal organisation.

Party head Nikos Michaloliakos has been arrested, along with 
spokesman Ilias Kassidiaris, and police officials 
said a total of about 35 arrest warrants for Golden Dawn members have 
been issued are pending for 'three or four other' Golden Dawn deputies.

Police said the counterterrorism unit was investigating the party in connection with the stabbing to death of the anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fissas by a man who declared himself a Golden Dawn supporter, which sparked violent protests in Athens earlier this month.

The arrests mark the first time since 1974 that sitting members of Parliament have been arrested - then marking the fall of the military Junta and the restoration of democracy in the country.

Golden Dawn has vehemently denied any role in the killing on September 17 of the rapper - who went by the stage name of Killah P.

It has warned it may pull its 18 lawmakers from parliament in the government crackdown does not stop.

But the incident seems to have damaged its appeal among Greek, and sparked violent anti-fascist protests in the streets of Athens on September 18.

A
 formerly marginal organization with neo-Nazi roots, Golden Dawn entered
 the Greek Parliament for the first time in May 2012, capitalizing on 
Greece's deep financial crisis, rising crime and anti-immigrant 
sentiment, polling just under 7 per cent.

A government spokesman refused to comment on the details of the operation.

'Democracy can protect itself. Justice will do its job,' government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou told reporters.

Retribution: People gather at the site where Pavlos Fissas was killed after a soccer match shown in a cafe. The slogan on the door reads: 'Revenge'

The
 party's members and supporters have frequently been suspected of 
carrying out violent attacks, mainly against immigrants. Despite its 
reputation for violence, the party had enjoyed growing popularity as 
poverty has risen in Greece.

Two police officials confirmed the arrests, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly.

'The Secretary General and one lawmaker of the Golden Dawn Party were arrested a short while ago after arrest warrants were issued," Greek police said in a text message to journalists.
