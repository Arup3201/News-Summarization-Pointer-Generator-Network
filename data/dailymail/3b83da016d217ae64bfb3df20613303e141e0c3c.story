A report into the management of the NHS that is said to be damning is being sat on by ministers, it was claimed last night.

Former Marks & Spencer boss Stuart Rose was asked a year ago by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to assess how NHS hospitals could keep ‘the very best leaders to help transform the culture in underperforming hospitals’.

He handed his report to ministers on time at the end of last year, but it has not been given a publication date, according to the Financial Times.

Last night, Labour said the report’s non-appearance showed government claims of transparency were ‘hollow’.

Launching the Rose Review in February, Mr Hunt described Lord Rose as ‘one of the country’s most inspirational leaders’ and said his report could play a significant role in stopping hospitals failing in the future. 

Mr Hunt added: ‘The difference between good and bad care can often lie in leadership.’

The Financial Times said last night that Lord Rose’s report – which is said to have described the overall standard of much NHS management as ‘totally shocking’ – had been handed to the Department of Health in December.

Despite ministers receiving it, the paper claimed that no publication date has been set. One individual who has been in meetings where the report was discussed said it had been put on ‘the back burner’.

Lord Rose, now chairman of online supermarket Ocado, has concluded that mediocre managers are allowed to move from job to job without being held to account.

The retail chief credited with turning around the fortunes of M&S is concerned that NHS managers – lacking the same control over pay and conditions as private sector counterparts – too often rely on top-down diktats to drive performance, according to a source with whom he discussed the report.

The NHS has been Labour’s spearhead policy which it has championed in its bid to win May’s general election. 

But criticism of its track record in Wales, where Labour controls the NHS, has called the party’s ability to run the health service into question.

For this reason Conservative strategists will be anxious to avoid criticism of their own record with the NHS. 

Lynton Crosby, David Cameron’s election adviser, has emphasised that nothing should detract from the Tories’ focus on their economic record.

Criticism of NHS management is a thorny issue for the coalition after contentious reforms were implemented almost two years ago in an attempt to make the NHS more efficient. 

The changes were designed to simplify management structures and hand power to clinicians. 

However the measures were recently branded by the King’s Fund, a respected think tank, as an expensive distraction from the real problems facing the service, and the result had been a lack of ‘system leadership’.

Negative comments from a private sector leader could be particularly sensitive given opposition claims that the Government is seeking to privatise the NHS – even though Lord Rose’s remit specifically precluded consideration of a bigger role for private sector companies.

The Department of Health said: ‘We will be publishing the report in due course.’

Ed Miliband has been accused of misleading voters after Labour sent out letters made to look like they were from a hospital or GP surgery.

Many were left upset by the mail, which could easily be mistaken for test results or notification of changes in local NHS provision.

The letters come in envelopes saying that they contain important information about the NHS. It is only when people read the contents that they realise it is a message from the Labour leader. Mr Miliband has been condemned as ‘cruel’ and ‘insensitive’ after the letters were received by hospital patients, the elderly and families of the recently deceased.

Opponents accused him of scare tactics and say it is further evidence of his campaign to ‘weaponise’ the NHS ahead of the general election.

In the letter, Mr Miliband writes about the ‘challenges facing your local hospital’ and warns that ‘services here are struggling’. Despite the claim that it concerns the future of ‘local NHS services’, exactly the same message is being sent to homes across the country.

Misleading?: Across the top of the envelope is the message: ‘Important information about the future of local NHS services' and recipients only find out the letter's true message once they have opened it
