Ambush: Six friends were at the home in a gated community on Saturday night when Mr Grich was fatally shot

The electrical engineering major died after three masked men burst in through an unlocked back door. Police are baffled as to why Mr Grich was targeted.

The sheriff told the Independent Mail: 'He was a very dedicated student, dedicated to his studies at the university and well-liked. We have yet to find anyone who has anything bad to say about him.'

Police would not say if anything had been stolen from the home. One white male and two black males, traveling in a  black 2005 Dodge Durango with tinted windows and South Carolina plates, have been linked to the killing.

The upscale, gated community in South Carolina has 24-hour surveillance and gates but is difficult to police, the sheriff's office said. Last year, a university student died of alcohol poisoning in the area.

Autopsy results are expected later today. Funeral arrangements have yet to be made for the 23-year-old.

A Facebook group titled RIP Steven Gregory Grich was set up on Sunday. One friend David Livingston wrote: 'My prayers and heart go out to this family for such a tragic loss.'

Another post said: 'When I think of Steven, two words come to mind: Music and Science.'

A friend Michael Marshall added: 'Steve was one of the smartest kids I have ever known.'

University officials urged students to 
lock their doors and be on the lookout of suspicious behavior following 
the attack on Saturday.
