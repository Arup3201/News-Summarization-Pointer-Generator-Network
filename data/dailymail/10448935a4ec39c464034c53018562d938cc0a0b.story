Swansea City have ended speculation surrounding Ashley Williams’ future by tying their captain down to a new four-year contract.

It is a huge boost for Garry Monk, who was desperate to keep the 29-year-old at the Liberty Stadium.

Sunderland are understood to have made an offer for the defender, while Arsenal and QPR are known admirers of the Wales captain.

Staying put: Ashley Williams has decided to stay at the Liberty Stadium

He had only one year left on his contract going into the summer and he is believed to have seriously considered moving on after six years at the club.

But Swansea have made him one of the top earners at club, with wages in the region of £45,000 a week before bonuses, and Williams said: ‘I’m delighted to sign a new contract at Swansea City.

'I’ve enjoyed fantastic success at this club and I want to keep helping Swansea City progress.

'I respect this club and everyone associated with it, and I love it here.

'I’ve been here for six years, so it’s home for me. I hope to finish my career here – I’ve had that viewpoint for a long time.

'I am very happy here and I’ve enjoyed a lot of success at Swansea. I’m delighted to sign this new contract.'

Leader: Ashley Williams wears the Swansea City armband with pride

A club statement added: ‘Swansea City captain Ashley Williams has ended speculation of his future by signing a new four-year contract at the club. 

‘Williams’ contract had one year left to run, but the centre-back has put pen to paper on a new deal that will keep him at the Liberty until the summer of 2018. 

‘It ends reported interest in the Swans and Wales skipper, who will be among the travelling squad jetting off on Sunday for the club’s pre-season tour in America.’

Swansea still face a summer of upheaval, though, with Tottenham close to signing left-back Ben Davies in a move that could see Gylfi Sigurdsson return to south Wales.

The future of Michu is also uncertain, with the club understood to be willing to listen to offers, while Michel Vorm could leave after the arrival of Lukasz Fabianski. Wilfried Bony has drawn interest following his 25-goal debut season, but no firm offers have been received.
