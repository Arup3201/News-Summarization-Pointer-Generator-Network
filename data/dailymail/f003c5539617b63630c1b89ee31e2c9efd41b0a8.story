Beachgoers in Hawaii have been left mystified after millions of tiny purple creatures, curled up in balls, appeared on the shoreline.

The identity of the strange, pea-sized animals - littered along the beaches of Oahu, Honolulu - has also perplexed marine biologists, who have never seen anything like it.

Most of the crabs, which washed up in the surf over the past few days, were dead or dying.

On closer inspection, scientists believe the creatures, less than an inch long, may be the larvae of 7-11 crabs

Experts at Waikiki Aquarium believe 
they may be the larval stages of the 7-11 crab, a crustacean commonly 
found in the area, but added there has never been an event like this 
before.

Norton Chan, a biologist at the aquarium, said: 'What you are seeing is a swimming stage,
probably a few more molts before they settle into their crab stage 
self.'

Researchers are said to be studying those which are still alive to try to find out what they will
grow to become.

The 7-11 
crab (above) is so named because when first seen in the water, it has seven 
spots but closer inspection reveals a further four on its underbelly.

Also known as the spotted reef crab, it can grow up to 7inches long.

They live in the tidepool reef - and according to legend, the spots are the results of a fight with a sea god.

While the tiny crabs that washed up were purple, the 7-11 has a rusty orange shell - although its spots are maroon.

It generally feeds at night on other crustaceans and invertebrates and hides during the day.

The little crabs are less than an inch long and, if they are 7-11 crabs, they will eventually grow to around six or seven inches.

'The lifeguard called and asked what 
these things were because she had reports that surfers were actually having 
these things crawl up on their boards and onto them,' Mr Chan added.

Meanwhile, one resident told KHON news: 'It's really weird.

'It looks like you want to eat it like a berry.'

Another said: 'When something washes up like this, you don't know what to expect - maybe tsunami stuff.'

The coastline affected stretches from Kahala to Ala Moana on the southern tip of Honolulu.

Dr Andrew Rossiter, director of the Waikiki Aquarium, reckoned that the crabs were washed up after rough seas left air bubbles in their shells, leaving them unable to dive.

As a result of this, they get caught up in tides and come ashore.

'It could be a flux of warm or cold water coming in but I don't have any signs of that,' Dr Rossiter told Hawaii News Now.

He added: 'And if it was pollution, it would have affected other species as well, so we really don't know [why this is happening].'
