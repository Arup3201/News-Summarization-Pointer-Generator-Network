Joe Kinnear faces fans' fury after an interview in which Newcastle's new director of football claimed he has 'more intelligence' than the club's supporters.

The 66-year-old has spent the last two days confirming he is back at the club as director of football, heading back to St James Park after a short but controversial spell as manager in the 2008-09 season.

Newcastle have yet to officially 
announce the news but their fans have been quick to voice their dissent,
 with one fanzine editor saying it made his club a laughing stock.

Kinnear's first time on Tyneside was 
overshadowed by a foul-mouthed rant at journalists, accusing them of 
having an agenda against him and, while he returned to his grudge 
against the media, he hit out at the fans as well.

When asked by talkSPORT what he would
 say to unhappy fans, he said: 'To all the fans who don't agree with 
this decision, shall I bring (Derek) Llambias (managing director) back 
in?. What do you want? What do they want?

'I heard a silly comment of "what can
 I attract?" I can open the door to any manager in the world, anyone, 
that's the difference. I've spent my whole life talking to Alex 
Ferguson, week in, week out, what would you do?

'I can pick the phone up at any time of the day and speak to Arsene Wenger, any manager in the league. In all the divisions.

'I don't know what angle they've got,
 if they want to sit down and argue with me... Some are talking out of 
their backsides, a load of tosh. I'm not accepting it, as simple as 
that. I have certainly got more intelligence than them, that's a fact.'

Kinnear's initial announcement caused surprise in the game, giving how his initial spell with Newcastle panned out.

While his time in the dugout was 
ended by a heart attack, results on the field contributed to the club's 
relegation from the Premier League.

United's fans have reacted 
accordingly but Kinnear, who called managing
 director Derek Llambias ‘Lambezi’, Yohan Cabaye ‘Kebab’ and Hatem Ben
 Arfa ‘Afri’ on talkSPORT, added: 'I'm a bit surprised. 
There's a certain section, exactly the same when I got there. I got over
 10,000 letters when I had my heart attack, I felt very proud of that 
and thought I did an excellent job.

'A lot of Geordies are influenced by 
the media set, because I stood up to 100 journalists that night. It was 
the same night we beat Tottenham 2-1, the journalists always had it in, 
many of the Geordie fans were sucked in.'

Sammy Ameobi - referred to as Amamobi - later tweeted: 'Wow, at least get my name right.'

And Steve Harper, who left the club 
last month after 19 seasons, added: 'Just listened to the amazing 
interview that you're all tweeting about from last 
night....#canspeakopenlyonapril1sorryjuly1.'

Kinnear went on to defend his record 
as a manager, adding: 'I look at my record and they keep saying to me 
"what did I do?". Where have these people been, on another planet? I've 
been manager of the year three times, travelled the world as a manager.

'This job came up, a responsible job.
 Already they're jumping on the bandwagon, "watch out Pards" (United 
manager Alan Pardew) but that's the snidey press around that area that 
have a grudge. I expect it, it's water off a duck's a***.'

Kinnear, who made his name as a 
manager at Wimbledon as part of the 'Crazy Gang', went on to underline 
that he does not see his presence as a threat to Pardew.

'This is not about some of the crap 
about me coming in and taking over. It's nonsense. I read an article 
saying "watch over your shoulder Pards". What a load of crap and they're
 feeding it to the Geordie fans. I hope they're not daft enough to 
believe it.'

Earlier, he told the Newcastle 
Chronicle: ‘Before I had a meeting with Mike, Derek said he’s informed 
Alan, and Alan said: “Great news – I’m delighted with that. At last I’ve
 got somebody who’s a football guy”.

‘Derek
 told me he’s had a long talk with Alan and explained that I’m coming in
 as director of football. He [Llambias] is going to go on the finance 
side and anything to do with football is coming my side.‘I am going to be delighted to be working with Alan. We are very open-minded and good with each other.

‘I
 have the utmost respect for him and I cannot see any problems between 
the two of us. I am not the type of guy who causes problems for the sake
 of it. I want the best for all of us.’
