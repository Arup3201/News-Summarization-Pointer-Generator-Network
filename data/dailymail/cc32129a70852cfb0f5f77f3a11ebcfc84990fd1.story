A Connecticut teacher who helped save her 15 first-graders' lives during the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012 has signed a book deal.

G.P. Putnam's Sons announced today that 'Choosing Hope: Moving Forward from Your Life's Darkest Hour' by teacher Kaitlin Roig-DeBellis, 30, will be released next spring.

The publisher says the book will be a 'poignant account of personal triumph over unbearable tragedy.' Robin Gaby Fisher is co-writing it.

Roig-DeBellis hurried 15 first-graders into a bathroom upon hearing gunfire at the school in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012, saving their lives.

The gunman, Adam Lanza, eventually shot himself to death after gunning down his mother, six teachers and 20 children.

Last year, Roig-DeBellis founded Classes 4 Classes, a nonprofit that advocates teaching children that all lives are connected.

After the massacre, Roig-DeBellis took almost a year off from teaching and said in December that it was still the first and last think she thinks of every day.

She told the Daily Telegraph: 'I remember, in the days after, it was so hard to get out of bed.

'I just walked around singing Amazing Grace just over and over and over, because it was so incredibly hard.

Kaitlin Roig-DeBellis said a year after the tragedy that it's still the first and last thing she thinks of every day

'In my mind constantly is what my students went through, and I think about the lives that were lost. So it's not so much a realization that a year has passed. It truly is a constant, all the time.'

The tragedy at Sandy Hook, among the most deadly school shootings in U.S. history, rocked the leafy, suburban town 70 miles northeast of New York City.

Lanza, a 20-year-old loner who appeared to have had severe emotional problems, used guns that had been bought legally by his mother, Nancy.

He killed her in her bed, then drove to the elementary school he had once attended, shooting his way in just as the school day was getting started. After the rampage, he shot himself.

When he entered the school, Mrs Roig-DeBellis's class was seated in a circle, sharing their holiday traditions.

'I got up, I closed the door, I turned the lights off and I turned to my students and I said: 'We need to get into the bathroom - right now',' she said.

The bathroom was not more than 3ft by 4ft, too small to even hold a sink. Children climbed on to the toilet, behind the toilet. One perched on the toilet paper dispenser.

Mrs Roig-DeBellis used a storage unit to barricade the door. About 45 minutes later, when the police arrived, Mrs Roig-DeBellis would not let them in. For days after, she was in a daze, unsure if she was dead or alive.

The shootings shocked the nation and led President Obama to propose a series of new gun-control measures, including an expansion of federal background-check laws.

Those efforts were blocked in the U.S. Senate after some lawmakers argued the changes would be onerous to law-abiding gun owners.
