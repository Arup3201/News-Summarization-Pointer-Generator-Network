A family has been left devastated after their pet dog was discovered 'murdered' in a ditch with its legs bound together and a towel left over its head.

Sam the Jack Russell  had been missing for weeks when his lifeless body was discovered three miles from his owner's home in Llanmartin, South Wales.

Owner Joanne Dean said she was 'sickened' by the discovery as authorities appeal for information. 

Sam the Jack Russell was found dead in a ditch some three miles from his home in Llanmartin, South Wales, with his paws bound and head covered by a towel

'I'm sickened really, I'm devastated. I don't know how someone could do such a thing. 

'Sam escaped out of our back garden. He'd done it before and was returned to us but this time he didn't come back,' the 42-year-old said.

'It was shocking in the way he was found. I don’t know how he died, just how he was found.'

The animal's body was found on a grassy common three miles from the family's home. The RSPCA is appealing for anyone with information about his death to come forward. 

'We are completely devastated and sickened.

'I can’t sleep because it’s going over and over in my mind

'This isn’t the way our sweet old dog should have died. I am appalled anyone could do this to a living creature,' Ms Dean added.

The 'sweet' dog has escaped from home before but was always returned, his owners said. The RSPCA is appealing for anyone who may have information about his death to come forward

RSPCA inspector Emma Smith said: 'At the moment we are unsure of the circumstances leading to Sam’s death.

'Sam had escaped from the back garden and his owners could not find him.

'They put up posters and put it on Facebook. But sadly a member of the public found the dog dead in the ditch and took him to a veterinary surgery who contacted us.

'He had his front and his back legs tied and a black towel over his head.

'If anybody saw Sam after December 22 and has any information about what happened to him please get in touch.

'It must have been so traumatic for the owners for their dog to go missing just before Christmas and then not get any news until we tell them he has been found in such awful circumstances.'
