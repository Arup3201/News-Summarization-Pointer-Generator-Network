A Detroit boy who was found in his own basement after a highly publicized search into his 11-day disappearance is said to have suffered physical and psychological abuse.

Police found Charlie Bothuell V thin and hiding among boxes in his family's townhouse home last June, a stunning turnabout in a search that involved local, state and federal officers.

The discovery led to allegations that his father and stepmother forced him to go through rigorous twice-a-day workouts, kept him away from other kids, deprived him of proper food and abused him.

Charlie Bothuell IV, 46, and Monique Dillard-Bothuell, 37, are charged with child abuse and torture and current hearings will determine if they stand trial. They have pleaded not guilty.

Charlie Bothuell V, now 13, was found in the basement of his family's Detroit townhouse home after his 11-day disappearance. A doctor says the boy, who was found thin and with bruises, was the victim of abuse

Dr Dena Nazer of Children's Hospital of Michigan didn't examine Charlie or speak to him., but she was allowed to testify based on a review of his medical records, photos and his statements to other medical staff.

Dr Nazer said Charlie, 12 at the time, indicated that his stepmother sent him to the basement because he didn't do his twice daily workout

The routine allegedly involved doing 100 pushups, 200 situps, 100 jumping jacks, 25 arm curls with a 25-pound weight and thousands of revolutions on an elliptical machine.

She said the boy had bruises on his chest and buttocks, which were consistent with his claim that he had been beaten with a PVC pipe.

'He was also threatened to be killed and told no one would know because he was home-schooled,' Dr Nazer said 

'He was subjected to more than one kind of child abuse,' Dr Nazer told a judge. 

'He was subjected to child physical abuse and psychological abuse in terms of isolation and deprivation.'

Charlie Bouthell IV, 46, and Monique Dillard-Bothuell, 37, face charges of child abuse and torture that could lead to life prison sentences

The father famously found out that his son had been found in his basement while being interviewed by HLN's Nancy Grace 

The doctor's testimony didn't reveal much new information. Authorities for months have alleged that Charlie was abused.

The lawyer for Charlie Bothuell IV said that his client's son 'is a liar' and made up his abuse.

'(The son) lives in this fantasy world and that's what this case is all about,' attorney Shawn Patrick Smith said, according to the Detroit News.

'It looks staged,' he said, adding that his client, a nurse, had been bankrupted by the proceedings. 

Investigators had been in Bothuell's basement before with specially trained dogs but did not find the boy.

Last year a neighbor showed Daily Mail Online a tunnel from the basement where he could have used a bathroom or escaped to the outside.  

Dillard-Bothuell's attorney repeatedly asked Nazer if she was familiar with the exercise routine of young athletes, a suggestion that Charlie's drills weren't unusual.

The parents allegedly threatened to kill Charlie Bouthell V, according to Dr Dena Nazer's testimony about suspected abuse

'She's not a sports coach. She's a doctor,' Judge Shannon Holmes said, stopping the questions.

Charlie now is 13 and in the custody of his biological mother. 

He is expected to testify after hearings resume on April 14.

Torture in Michigan carries up to a life prison sentence on conviction.

Second-degree child abuse is punishable by up to four years in prison. 

Charle Bothuell IV was told that his son was found in his basement during a television interview with HLN's Nancy Grace. 

'The FBI checked my basement. The police checked my basement. My wife checked my basement. I've been down there several times. We've all been checking,' he said at the time. 

The father has since terminated his parental rights.
