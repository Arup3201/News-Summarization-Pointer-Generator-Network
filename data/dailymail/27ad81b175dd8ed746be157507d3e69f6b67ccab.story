You would think it would take a bit more than Irish charm to talk your way past security and into $25,000 seats at the Super Bowl. 

But that's exactly what a pair of Seattle Seahawks fans from the Emerald Isle managed to do for the main event at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on Sunday.

Richard Whelan from Dublin and Paul McEvoy from Cahir had made the 5,000 mile trip hoping their team would take the title against the New England Patriots - and they'd be there to see it.

The pair may have wanted the Patriots to lose but at least their mascot was game for waving the Irish flag

Facing prices of up to $10,000 for a single seat, it looked as though their hopes might be dashed, until they decided to put their bluffing skills to the test. 

After getting interviewed by the NFL Network in an unsuccessful effort to try and land tickets, they thought they'd try just walking up to the front door and seeing what happened.

Whelan gleefully documented what followed on Twitter as the pair had an evening they won't be forgetting in a hurry.

He told RTE Radio One Morning Ireland: 'Our game plan was to be super confident.

'We just thought if we pretend we belong there, nobody will question us. 

'Between one layer of security and another we just walked in behind these 20 first aid workers, straight up to the front door and hid in behind them.

'Paul was looking at his phone, pretending to text me, as if we had just popped out to look at an email we got or something.

'We walked past another security guard that just wasn't paying attention. We could see the field then, the stadium and the atmosphere was insane…I remember looking at Paul's face, we just couldn't believe we got in.' 

To celebrate their incredible good luck, Whalen tweeted: 'I fu**ing made it!! Snook in straight through the front door! NOW LET'S GO HAWKS!.'

And there was more good fortune to come after the pair spent the first half jumping from seat to seat when people had gone off to the toilet or for food and convincing the Patriots mascot to pose with an Irish flag. 

During halftime they stumbled across two empty seats in the fourth row worth a cool $25,000 each, next to former Patriots legend Lawyer Milloy, who finished his illustrious NFL career at the Seahawks.

Whalen said: 'We spoke to this guy and told him we had sneaked in. He told us the girls beside him were in the halftime show and so wouldn't be coming back to their seats after halftime.

'So we ended up in the fourth row, sitting beside a former Super Bowl champion Lawyer Milloy who gave us a play-by-play of the game … It was pretty cool to have the Super Bowl champion sharing all the details.'

Unfortunately their team fell agonizingly short, losing 28-24 to a Tom Brady-inspired Patriots. 

Along with a pic of him and McEvoy, Whelan tweeted: 'Getting ready for the long trip back to Dublin. Hopefully I'm allowed back home :).' 

But at least they managed to find their way onto a VIP bus back to their hotel.

'It was a good day of hustling,' Whalen admitted. 

'What seemed impossible came true.' 

They tried to score tickets by doing a television interview but didn't have any joy with that approach

Unfortunately for the two Seahawks fans their team came unstuck against a Tom Brady-inspired Patriots

These are the astronomical prices they were looking at for a seat - had they been minded to pay for one
