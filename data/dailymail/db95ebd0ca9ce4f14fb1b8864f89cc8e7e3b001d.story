Jose Mourinho launched a scathing attack on Premier League referees after Chelsea's draw with Southampton in order to pile pressure on officials, according to Gary Neville.

Mourinho said referee Anthony Taylor should be 'ashamed' of his performance after his side were not awarded a penalty when Cesc Fabregas appeared to be fouled by Southampton starlet Matt Targett.

The Portuguese tactician labelled the incident a 'scandal' before adding 'there is a campaign against Chelsea' and Neville believes Mourinho's statement was a clever ploy.

Neville, speaking on Sky Sports, said: 'He has planted a seed for the rest of the season. He'll probably take a fine for that.

'What Mourinho has done today has said he's drawing a line in the sand and said, "I'm not accepting this any more", letting the referees know this is unacceptable for the rest of the season.

'The campaign bit is him saying he's not having this any more.'

Neville's comments came after Mourinho said this following the draw with Southampton: ‘The reality is that there are penalties and there are penalties - this was one was big, like Big Ben.

‘Referees are not here to guess, they are there to see. He assumed dishonest with Cesc and he is wrong. 

‘Match after match coaches are saying Chelsea players are diving. Out of nothing Sam Allardyce starts talking about my players.

‘I will go to the referee, wish him a good year and tell him he will be ashamed. There is a campaign against Chelsea. 

‘In other countries where I worked before, tomorrow in the sports papers it would be front-page scandal because it is a scandal.

‘In this country - and I am happy with that, more than happy with that - we will just say that it was a big mistake with a big influence in the result.

‘I am happy that it is this way, with respect for the referee. He made a big mistake like I make, like the players make sometimes.’

Mourinho was furious with Taylor's decision to caution Fabregas when Targett appeared to clip the Spaniard while attempting to  control the ball inside the penalty area.

The former Barcelona midfielder became the fifth Chelsea player to be booked for diving this season, following Diego Costa, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and Willian.

Mourinho added: ‘They are not incidents, they are not incidents - that’s a campaign, that's a campaign. That's a clear campaign.

‘People, pundits, commentators, coaches from other teams - they react with Chelsea in a way they don't react to other teams.

‘You know the most crucial things over the last two weeks are not the cards? It is Filipe Luis and Eden Hazard because they could be in hospital with broken legs.'
