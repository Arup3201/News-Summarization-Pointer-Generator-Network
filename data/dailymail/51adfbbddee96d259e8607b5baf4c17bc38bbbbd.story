A spurned girlfriend led police on a high-speed chase after tossing Molotov cocktails into her ex's home.

Heather Kullson, 21, was charged on Tuesday with arson, assault and 
eluding police after she was finally stopped following two separate chases that 
reached 90 miles per hour.

Police were called to an apartment building in Lewiston, Maine at 6pm after reports that a woman had tried to start a fire by throwing bottles filled with flammable liquid from her car.

Anger: The 21-year-old allegedly ran over her ex-boyfriend's foot during the incident on Tuesday

Officers chased the woman but called the pursuit off after she accelerated to dangerously high speeds.

Kullson later returned to the scene and once again tried to torch the property, authorities said. Another police chase ensued and this time the woman was caught in the town of Poland.

The 21-year-old, who has a young son called Noah, had gone to her ex-boyfriend's apartment on Tuesday afternoon to collect belongings when the meeting turned sour.

She allegedly ran over her boyfriend's foot before fleeing. She later returned armed with the homemade weapons.

Lewiston Police Lt. Mike McGonagle told News 8: 'The whole incident was dangerous. She had filled a couple of bottles of 12 to 15 ounces of liquid in a bottle and went to throw it on something.

'That's dangerous, and obviously leading the police on a chase down the Maine Turnpike at 90 mph-plus is dangerous.'

Kullson is being held at the Androscoggin County Jail on $25,000 bond.

On
her Facebook page, several comments had been posted relating to 
Kullson's arrest. One user wrote: 'How's jail treating you by the way??
