A defiant Mitt Romney hit back against accusations that he is a rich guy out-of-touch with ordinary people’s concerns by saying he doesn’t think ‘anyone could care less’ about how many cars he owns.

In an interview with 610 WTVNM radio in Ohio, Romney, who was lambasted last week for casually mentioning that his wife Ann ‘drives a couple of Cadillacs’, bristled at the suggestion that the number of vehicles his family owned was of any relevance and doubled down on his previous statement.

Speaking from Michigan, he said: ‘I don't think anyone here could care less. A month ago, I was asked what cars do we own.

‘I pointed out that we had a Ford Mustang, a Chevy truck and Ann has a Cadillac and then we have a second car that we have at our second home, that's a Cadillac that she keeps that she didn’t turn in when she bought the new one.’

Asked how he felt when people attacked him for having ‘a lot more money in some cases than a lot of Americans’, Mr Romney responded: ‘I’m not going to apologise for being successful.

‘In fact one of the reasons I’m in this race is that I believe that my experience in the private sector having competed around the world enables me to know what it takes to get America working again and to bring good jobs back to this country.’

Meanwhile, two days away from Tuesday's critical primary in Michigan, Mr Romney detoured to Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, for the NASCAR race on Sunday.

He visited the track for a few hours 
before the scheduled start of the Daytona 500, spoke briefly at the 
pre-race drivers' meeting and spent time walking around the garage and 
pit areas.

Mr Romney was introduced at the drivers' 
meeting and received hearty applause from drivers, team members and 
other VIPs. ‘This combines a couple of things I like best - cars and 
sports,’ he said.

‘I appreciate the spirit of the men and women that are driving today. This is a chance to really look at some of the determination and great qualities of the human spirit.

‘This is quintessentially American. I 
love what you're doing, happy to be here today, wish you all the very 
best and God bless this great nation of ours.’

Mr Romney acknowledged that he isn't 
necessarily a hard-core fan but has a working knowledge of the sport and
friendships with some of the people involved in racing.

'I have some great friends who are NASCAR team owners,' he said.

With a campaign event scheduled in 
Michigan later on Sunday, Mr Romney wasn't scheduled to stay for the race -
just as well, because it was postponed until Monday by rain.

Mr Romney has also indicated he is confident of winning in Ohio, which votes on Super Tuesday - March 6th - and where his main rival Rick Santorum is currently leading in the polls.

‘10 days ago I was 15 points behind in Michigan. Today I’m up slightly in Michigan. I expect to be able to do the same thing in Ohio.’

Mr Santorum showed no signs of letting up on Mr Romney, stating that by introducing ‘Obamacare lite’ in Massachusetts he had rendered himself ‘uniquely unqualified’ to take on President Barack Obama.

‘I believe in markets, I believe in free people,’ he told a Chamber of Commerce breakfast in Livonia, Michigan.

'One of the reasons I’m in this race is that I believe that my experience in the private sector having competed around the world enables me to know what it takes to get America working again and to bring good jobs back to this country'

Mitt Romney

‘I don’t believe in government telling us what to do. We need someone like that running against Barack Obama, not someone who did “Obamacare lite”.

‘In Michigan, why would we give this issue away? It is the biggest issue in this race. It's about government control of your economic lives, regulating you, taxing you, forcing you to buy things, then forcing their values on you and your religion.

‘Which, by the way, Governor Romney did in Catholic hospitals in Massachusetts by forcing them to distribute the morning after pill.

‘Why is it we give those issues away in the general election? At the core of what's at stake in this country. Why do we put someone up there who's uniquely unqualified to make that case?’
