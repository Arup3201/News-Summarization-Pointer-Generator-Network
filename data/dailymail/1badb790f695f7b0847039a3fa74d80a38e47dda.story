Opponents of the controversial HS2 line are ‘putting the future of the North of England at risk’, David Cameron told business leaders yesterday.

Speaking at the CBI annual conference, the Prime Minister insisted HS2 was a ‘vital investment’ which will guarantee that in future, economic growth will not be confined to the South of England. 

He also dismissed suggestions that there are other ways of tackling the cost of modernising the railways.

In a clear swipe at Labour, Mr Cameron said: ‘To people who say there is some other cost-reduction plan we could also have, I say that is nonsense.

‘People who are against it, in my view, are putting our country’s future at risk, they are putting the future of the North of England at risk. 

‘We need to have a concerted consensus across business, across politics, that we are going to get behind these large infrastructure projects.’

The Prime Minister said he was ‘passionate’ about the HS2 scheme, which will initially link London with Birmingham before being extended into a Y-shaped route that will reach Manchester and Leeds.

He added: ‘We need to build new railway lines in our country. We haven’t built a line that is north of London for 120 years. I think it is absolutely right to make this investment.

‘It is going to unite our country, it 
will help drive economic growth, it will make sure our economy shares 
growth between the North and South, it will link eight of our ten 
biggest cities.’

Mr Cameron also rejected arguments that the cost of HS2 will divert investment away from other work on the UK’s transport network. 

He pointed out that planned spending on the project between 2015 and 2020 totals £16billion – less than a quarter of the £73billion earmarked for improvements to roads and railways.

Attempting to shore up support for the faltering scheme, the Prime Minister went on to announce that Sir David Higgins, the new boss of the planned rail link, had been tasked with finding ways to cut the estimated £50billion price of the scheme, drive down costs and ‘make it affordable for our country’.

The former chief executive of the London Olympic Delivery Authority, Sir David - who takes over as HS2 chairman next year - believes the scheme can come in ‘substantially’ under current estimates if cuts are made to the £14billion contingency costs.

Mr Cameron told the CBI: ‘I want to make sure we get every penny of value for money from this HS2 investment. I think it is fantastic that Sir David Higgins - the man who built the Olympics on time and on budget - is going to be running HS2.

‘I think with Sir David Higgins in charge, with the budget we have and the contingency we have, this is a good investment for Britain.’

He added: ‘One of the first things he is going to do is make absolutely sure we drive every extra bit of cost out of this that we can, so it comes in under the budget that’s been set.

‘There is already a contingency of £14billion there. I know he will do a good job and make it affordable for our country.’ 

The scheme will need cross-party approval if it is to succeed, but at the same conference, shadow chancellor Ed Balls announced that Labour was still concerned about spiralling costs.

He told business leaders that he was not going to be signing a ‘blank cheque’ for the plans. In his speech, Mr Balls went on to say: ‘Labour supports HS2 because of the capacity constraints on the existing rail network. 

‘But our support for it is not at any cost. The Labour Party cannot - and will not - give the Government a blank cheque. Building a consensus about long-term infrastructure does not mean turning a blind eye to value for money.’
