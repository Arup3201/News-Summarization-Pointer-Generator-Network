He's been brought in to keep the British economy in trim.

But new Bank of England boss Mark Carney has caused some cutbacks sooner than planned – after removal men knocked down a huge tree branch while moving him into his luxury London home.

The entire street was sealed off and police and fire crews were called out after a giant container truck containing the new governor’s belongings smashed into the tree.

Neighbourhood watch: Mr Carney meets one of the residents of the London street where people have complained about the £1,300 suspension of six parking bays to make way for removal vans

The large branch was left hanging precariously over the road and traffic was banned until the area was made safe.

A
witness said: ‘It was a huge removal truck – a shipping  container. It 
squeezed out of the street between cars and there was a large crack as 
it whacked into a large, overhanging branch. I don’t think the driver 
even knew he had hit the tree, and just continued.’

But
Mr Carney, 48, looked relaxed in casual trousers and a polo shirt as he
kept an eye on the removal men.  He carried in a chopping board and 
fetched the movers coffee from a cafe.

The Canadian and wife Diana must have been hoping to keep a low profile, but their clumsy arrival caused chaos in the  residential neighbourhood in London. Mr Carney had already angered residents by arranging for the suspension of as many as six parking bays in the  street – at a total cost of £1,300 – to make way for his convoy  of removal vehicles.

Some residents were unable to even get into their driveways because of the trucks.

Neighbour Vivianne Avidan said: ‘I am surprised the council allowed so many bays to be taken out for so long. Maybe it is diplomatic, special privileges.’

Earlier this year, Mrs Carney suggested on Twitter that the couple were struggling to find a London home they could afford – despite her husband’s £874,000 salary which includes a £5,000 a month housing allowance. The couple have rented the property.

A spokesman for the local council said:  ‘We left the tree in a safe condition. There is no compensation sought.’

European Freight Services, which delivered Mr Carney’s belongings, declined to comment.
