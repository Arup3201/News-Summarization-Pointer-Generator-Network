Labour was accused of an own goal last night after it sent out leaflets accusing the Tories of selling off the NHS – with adverts for private healthcare attached.

Voters in key marginal seats received the mailshot condemning the Conservatives’ ‘NHS privatisation agenda’ and boasting how Labour would ‘save’ the NHS.

But embarrassingly for Ed Miliband, his party’s ‘plan for the NHS’ arrived with leaflets advertising private healthcare.

Households in London received theirs with an AXA PPP Healthcare leaflet declaring: ‘People like you could avoid NHS waiting lists through our Fast Track Appointments service with our Health Select private healthcare insurance.’

Elsewhere, the mailshot arrived with literature for Bupa care homes.

Labour MPs have privately vented their fury at the ‘cock-up’.

Party officials last night said the leaflets were distributed and delivered by the Royal Mail, adding: ‘We are not responsible for any other leaflets the Royal Mail delivers.’

But Tory chairman Grant Shapps seized on the mishap, saying: ‘Ed Miliband wants to play politics with our precious Health Service but his attempts to do so backfire every time.’
