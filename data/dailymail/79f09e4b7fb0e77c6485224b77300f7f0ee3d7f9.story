Budapest was on high alert yesterday as the River Danube threatened to burst its banks and flood the historic city.

The river peaked at record highs as desperate homeowners, hotel staff and military reservists piled sandbags in front of their buildings to protect the Hungarian capital.

Tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes and at least a dozen people have been killed in floods that have hit central Europe in the past week.

Thousands have been put up in emergency shelters waiting for the waters to recede so they can get back to their homes.

Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic have all been affected by the worst floods in central Europe in a decade.

The Danube – Europe’s second longest river which flows through four capital cities and ten countries – started rising rapidly in Hungary last Friday.

The country announced a state of ‘extreme danger’ which is likely to last into next week as the waters are expected to recede very slowly.

Central Europe has seen a week of torrential rain and perilous flooding

Twenty people reportedly have died in the floods across central Europe after several days of heavy rains

At least 1,200 people from 28 towns and villages have been forced to leave their homes and 44 roads have been closed, it was reported.

The Danube was expected to peak at 29.4 feet in Budapest last night – worryingly near the river's flood fences which are 30.5 feet tall.

The previous record high was 28 feet in the 2006 floods. In a devastating flood in 1838, the Danube killed 150 people and left more than 50,000 homeless.

The deluge reached Hungary on Friday but Prime Minister Viktor Orban  said 'the next two days will be decisive'

Yesterday, crowds gathered along the 
river to watch as water streamed past the bank and trickled through gaps
 in the wall, reaching the highest point ever recorded.

Staff from hotels on the bank of the Danube massed sandbags outside their buildings in a forlorn attempt to avoid the problem.

Men,
 women and children all helped to fill sandbags as the city attempted to
 avoid devastating floods.

More than six million have been used to shore
 up river defences.

Police
 directed traffic away from the river banks and just a few cars remained
 on what were previously busy roads while the subway was closed due to 
flooding.

However, authorities have said that river defences designed to withstand floods would be high enough to protect the city.

The Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban said dykes had been strengthened at critical points in Budapest.

In Budapest the government is reportedly planning a crisis meeting with the other countries affected to see how the cost of the disaster can be shared

He warned the next two days would be ‘decisive’ in the battle against the floods.

He added: ‘The (floods) are approaching the heart of the country now, we can say that the next two days will be decisive.

Referring to increased pressure on the sewage network from the Danube, he said: ‘In Budapest ... it is not simply the flood which is the problem ... but the complicated public works system through which all kinds of problems can arise.’
