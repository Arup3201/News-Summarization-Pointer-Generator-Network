One out of every eight albums sold worldwide is made by a British pop star – bringing billions into the country every year, figures revealed today.

Britain’s music industry grew 9 per cent last year adding £3.8 billion to the economy, according to the trade body, UK Music.

Global album sales, live concerts and cash made by song writing now support 111,000 full-time jobs in the country.

UK Music chief Jo Dipple said British pop industry now raised more money in taxes for the Government than the UK car industry.

Ms Dipple said: ‘The young, bearded kids in the pub, making a racket on a Friday night, might just turn out to generate more revenue for Her Majesty’s Treasury than a car manufacturer. But they need support to get there.’

British stars from Adele to Ellie Goulding are selling out concerts worldwide with albums topping the charts across Europe and the States.

Ms Dipple said everyone knew British music was world class – but claimed today’s report was the first time the industry could ‘put a figure to its value’.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said the music industry was one of the UK economy's biggest successes

She said: ‘Last year its contribution to our economy grew by 9 per cent. This is a big deal. We lead the world in song writing, composing, production, recordings and live performances.

‘You only have to glance at the 2014 Mercury nominees to understand what an eclectic, unique and world-leading bunch of musicians work in this country.’

Culture Minister, Sajid Javid added: ‘The UK Music industry is one of our biggest success stories. 

'Not only does it make a tremendous contribution to driving economic growth, but it plays a pivotal role in taking British culture to every corner of the globe.

‘One in every eight albums sold anywhere in the world is by a British artist, and I know that, with the ongoing support from Government, this dynamic sector will continue to flourish and thrive.’

But Ms Dipple claimed the Government needed to do more to protect copyright and educate young people about paying for music and the problems of piracy.

UK Music also called for Google and other web giants to give priority to licensed, online music services in search results and urged better access to bank finance for small music businesses.

Ms Dipple said UK Music wanted to help government ‘develop policies as good as the music we produce’.
