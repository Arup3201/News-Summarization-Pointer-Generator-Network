A 14-year-old boy who died after falling from a boat and apparently being hit by the spinning propeller has been described by his parents as a talented hockey player who dreamed of representing Great Britain at the 2020 Olympics.

Charlie Hutton died on Friday after he and a friend, also 14, fell from a boat driven by his father Simon, 52, as they sailed from Mudeford, Dorset to the Needles landmark off the Isle of Wight.The friend suffered serious but not life-threatening injuries.

Another 14-year-old boy managed to stay on board the vessel - a rigid hull inflatable boat - along with Mr Hutton.

Charlie Hutton, 14, was described by his heartbroken parents Simon and Gill as 'academically bright, an accomplished musician and an amazing field hockey player who had trained with the England under-15 team and had hoped to reach the England under-16 team this year, with the ambition of eventually playing for Britain in the Olympics in 2020.'

Police say there are no suspicious circumstances but are investigating how the two boys fell overboard.

Charlie, who attended the £14,424 a year Whitgift school in South Croydon, was taken to Southampton General Hospital by the coastguard helicopter but medics were unable to save his life.

His injured friend was taken to St Mary's Hospital on the Isle of Wight after being taken to shore by an RNLI lifeboat.

Charlie's devastated parents, Simon and Gill Hutton paid tribute to their multi-talented son in a statement issued by police.

They said: 'We are very sad to announce the death of our beautiful and very talented boy.

'Charlie, who loved the sea and water sports, was a schoolboy at Whitgift in South Croydon.

'His life touched many people and we know schoolfriends will be devastated.

'Two of his closest friends were with him when he died and I hope they remember the great times and laughs we had with Charlie in his final few days in Dorset.

The 14-year-old died after falling overboard from a rigid hull inflatable boat navigated by his father, Simon. Two of Charlie's best friends were with the family when he died - another 14-year-old boy sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries in the horrific accident.

'Charlie was academically bright, an accomplished musician and an amazing field hockey player who had trained with the England under-15 team and had hoped to reach the England under-16 team this year, with the ambition of eventually playing for Britain in the Olympics in 2020.

'His effort, passion and self-belief would surely have taken him there.

'With Ashley Jackson as his hero on the field, we hope that this same passion will help Great Britain win gold this year for Charlie and the country.

The tragedy happened as Charlie and his father, Simon, sailed towards the Needles off the west coast of the Isle of Wight with two of Charlie's best friends

The Isle of Wight is popular with sailors and Charlie Hutton was described as a lover of the sea and water sports

'Our thanks go to all those who helped Charlie achieve such an incredible amount.

'We would like to hold a private event for family and friends to celebrate Charlie’s life in the autumn when his school returns from the summer holidays.'

Police are preparing a file for the coroner, who has been informed, while the coastguard has notified the Marine Accident Investigation Branch.
