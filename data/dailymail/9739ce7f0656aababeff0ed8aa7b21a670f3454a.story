A series of photographs show how sleep apnea caused a four-year-old boy to fall asleep anywhere, anytime - even while standing up.

Andrea Evans, 28, from Ontario started photographing her son, Owen, with her iPhone in a bid to show how the medical condition affected him.

She told MailOnline that his sleeping habits are now markedly improved after surgeons removed his tonsils and adenoids last July.

Nap time! A series of photographs show how sleep apnea caused four-year-old Owen Evans to fall asleep anywhere, anytime - even while standing up

'Before he would wake up before 5am - usually because of his own snoring or his trouble breathing and then crash at around 10am or so.,' the mother-of-three said.

'Now he doesn't fall asleep like that as much anymore.

'Of course a really busy day he might pass out around dinner or so.'

Are you sure that's comfortable? The youngster's mother, Andrea, started photographing him to show how his condition affected him

Source of the problem: Owen's sleeping habits are now markedly improved after surgeons removed his tonsils and adenoids last July

This will do! Before, he would fall asleep in random places before making it to bed

Not another shopping trip! Children with sleep apnea maybe restless sleepers, wake up multiple times throughout the night, experience morning headaches and daytime sleepiness

According to the American Sleep Apnea Association, approximately one to four per cent of children in the United States suffer from sleep apnea.

In Mrs Evans' images, Owen is seen napping in the barber's chair, mid-play and at the dinner table.

One particularly adorable shot shows him sleeping in a laundry basket - an adequate substitute to his bed.

The tiled kitchen floor is revealed as a less comfortable-looking spot. 

Mrs Evans says Owen's favorite place to sleep is his bed 'snuggled with his warm blankets and teddies.'

But before, when he suffered from 
breathing difficulties. he often found it a struggle to make it upstairs
 and would fall asleep on the spot.

Making himself heard: Mrs Evans said Owen would often snore too

Common problem: According to the American Sleep Apnea Association, approximately one to four per cent of children in the United States suffer from sleep apnea

Curable: Surgery is usually the best option or dieting for patients who are overweight

Mrs Evans says she was quite envious of Owen's extreme napping abilities.

'Every mother would love an extra hour or more in the day to catch a few extra Zzzz's.'

She and her husband decided to post the photographs of Owen online to imgur.com last month in a bid to highlight the symptoms of sleep apnea. 

The album, titled 'Sleeping Pictures: My son and his bad sleeping habits' has been viewed more than 8,000 times to date.

Mrs Evans says while many commentators have branded the images 'comical' some have criticized her parenting skills.

'I have learned to brush it off and just 
laugh at people's first impressions,' she said.

Isolated incident: Mrs Evans says her other children, aged one and six, do not suffer from sleep apnea

'They have no idea what kind of 
parents we are and our 'negligence' and lacking routines is complete 
opposite.

'I am a very 
hands on stay at home mom.

'We started taking these pictures and 
videos to document what our doctor didn't really see to be an issue at the 
time.'

She says Owen never caught her taking photographs.

Although one time she filmed him 'asleep standing up against the fridge' and 'cried out a little' as he caught on to what she was doing.

The Evans' now have all of the pictures of Owen stored on their computer and plan on printing them out to make a photo album.

Mrs Evans says her other children, aged one and six, do not suffer from sleep apnea.
