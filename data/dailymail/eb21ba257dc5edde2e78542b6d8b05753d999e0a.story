The distraught parents of a child who died in hospital just eight hours after she was born have called for changes after claiming staff failed to respond to warning signs.

Simon and Mary-Jayne Harrison are not pursuing compensation, but they want Southend Hospital, Essex, to apologise and admit liability over the death over their daughter Jessica.

They want to ensure staff are properly trained to assess when a heart monitor flags up an issue so that no more parents have to suffer the agony of losing a child like they did.

Simon and Mary-Jayne Harrison and their 21-month
old daughter Rebecca: They want Southend Hospital to apologise 
and admit liability over the death over their daughter Jessica, who died
at just eight hours old

Complications during labour meant Jessica wasn’t breathing when she was born and had inhaled meconium - a baby’s first stool passed when in distress in the womb.

She also had a second infection from the placenta and had to be revived, but she died when she was just eight hours old.

Mr and Mrs Harrison claim warning signs of their baby's distress weren’t taken seriously by staff, and that they waited so long for an emergency caesarean that Jessica instead had to be delivered using forceps.

'The cord was around her neck and she had inhaled meconium so it was pouring from her nose and mouth,' said Mrs Harrison, 28.

'If the caesarean section had been done at 3am when we signed the papers, or earlier if they’d listened to our concerns about the warning bleeps on the monitor, my daughter would have stood more of a chance to fight the infections.'

Mr Harrison, 29, a teacher at St 
Thomas More School, Westcliff-on-Sea Essex, said: 'The monitor was 
flashing up concerns, but we were told there might be something wrong 
with the machine and they reset it.

'They should’ve taken it more seriously.

'Though
the waters broke at 8pm and there was no sign of meconium, the monitors
and also Mary-Jayne’s high temperature were indications of a problem.'

Mrs Harrison was told her fever was a 
side effect of the epidural, but she had no problem with her first 
child, Rebecca, who is now 21 months.

Her husband added: 'There must be a point where they have to take all these problems seriously.'

An emergency caesarean was decided at 3am, but another woman considered more urgent was admitted to theatre first.

The
parents, from Leigh, were told a second theatre could be opened if 
there was no more progress in an hour, but nothing happened until 6am 
when Mrs Harrison needed to push.

Staff worked for half an hour to get Jessica breathing and she was rushed to the special care baby unit. However doctors warned the couple their child may be brain dead or severely brain damaged.

Mr and Mrs Harrison made the heartbreaking decision to turn off Jessica’s life support at 3.15pm on September 30 last year. She weighed a healthy 7lbs 12oz.

'We were distraught. Jessica should’ve survived if things were taken seriously and they had acted sooner,' said Mr Harrison.

Mrs Harrison added: 'It was so unexpected. She was a healthy baby.

'This Christmas was horrible but we had to make it special for Rebecca. I went to a cold grave to see my baby girl when it should’ve been her first Christmas.

'I feel so sad for Rebecca to never know her sister. It’s so wrong.'

Pupils where Mr Harrison teaches have been busy fundraising for Great Ormond Street Hospital in memory of his daughter.

St Thomas More have held two charity weeks raising money for the hospital where Jessica was due to be transferred to for specialist treatment, but sadly never made it.

Mr Harrison was also treated there as a four-year-old boy for a non-malignant tumour behind his eye.

Students have raised about £3,000 from a charity seafront walk and other events held in school and an online page has £1,360 donations.

Mr and Mrs Harrison have called for the hospital to apologise and admit liability, but they are not pursuing a compensation claim.

The couple want to ensure changes are made so that staff are properly trained to assess when potential problems appear on heart monitor monitors, so no other parent has to go through the the grief they have suffered.

They also called for high risk pregnancies to be scanned towards the end of a birth to show difficulties with the placenta, and the cord and blood tests to be done to check for infection levels.

An inquest is yet to be held into Jessica’s death.

Southend Hospital says it has supported the family with meetings with clinicians and the head of midwifery and set up counselling for them.

Sue Hardy, director of nursing, said: 'We fully understand the distress the loss of a baby brings and once again offer our sincerest condolences to Mr and Mrs Harrison in their grief following the death of baby Jessica.

'The family have met with our clinical teams and our head of midwifery and we will continue to support and advise them during this very difficult pre-inquest period.'
