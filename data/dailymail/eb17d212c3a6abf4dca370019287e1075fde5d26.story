It was a day Graham Wagstaff feared he may never see.

Diagnosed with terminal lung disease, he desperately needed a transplant if he was to see his daughter Helen get married.

And to his utter relief, with just weeks to spare, he received a life-saving transplant in time to fly to California and walk her down the aisle.

Joy: Graham Wagstaff was so ill with lung disease that he feared he wouldn't live to see daughter Helen's wedding day - let alone walk her down the aisle

Saved: Mr Wagstaff had been battling lung disease due to a congential condition for several years and desperately needed a transplant. He got one with just weeks to spare before the wedding

Happiness: 'Seeing my daughter get married and being able to walk her down the aisle was one of the best moments of my life, I'll never forget it,' he said

Mr Wagstaff, 68, from Albrighton, Shropshire, had suffered with terminal lung disease for several years due to a congenital condition.

At one point he was so ill he was forced to close his business temporarily.

He said: 'It’s amazing that someone saying ‘yes’ to organ donation has led to me getting my life back.

'I was on oxygen 24/7 before the op and was so close to dying.

'It was so emotional actually being able to walk Helen down the aisle on her wedding day - I never thought I’d get the chance - and it was such a perfect day.'

'Without my new lungs I wouldn’t be here today, it’s a gift that I won’t be able to repay.

'Seeing
 my daughter get married and being able to walk her down the aisle was 
one of the best moments of my life, I’ll never forget it. I’m so grateful that I finally have my life back.'

Bride Helen said: 'Without the donor, my dad wouldn't have been able to walk me down the aisle - I can't imagine what my wedding would have been like without him'

Mr Wagstaff's brother died 16 years ago from the same lung disease, alveolitis, when he was 49.

He added: 'It was a shock when I received the same diagnosis, as knew how serious it could be.'

Helen, who moved to California five years ago to work as a dancer and actress, had been terrified her father would die before he found a donor match.

She said: 'It was amazing to have both my parents fly over to America for our big day in December.

'Dad was so unwell leading up to the wedding that we all feared he wouldn’t make it.'

'Without the donor my dad wouldn’t have been able to walk me down the aisle - I can’t imagine what my wedding would have been like without him.'

Struggle: Before the transplant, Mr Wagstaff (pictured right with daughter Helen) was so ill he relied on oxygen 24 hours a day and had been forced close to his business

'The day was so emotional, my dad’s speech was fantastic and it was amazing to see him looking so well after years of ill-health.

'As a family we want to do as much to raise awareness for Organ Donation as without it my dad wouldn’t be here today, my mum, Christine can’t believe how active he is now.'

Mrs Wagstaff said: 'We all had a brilliant time at the wedding, it was extra special because of Graham’s miracle gift he received just months before.

'He has been able to reopen his business and it was magical to see him walking our girl down the aisle.

'There wasn’t a dry eye between us all.'

Healthy: Mr Wagstaff (with daughter Helen and son-in-law Patrick) giving his speech at the wedding. His wife said there 'wasn't a dry eye in the house'

Mrs Wagstaff said: 'Since the transplant, Graham has been able to reopen his business and it was magical to see him walking our girl down the aisle'

Sally Johnson, Director of Organ Donation and Transplantation at NHS Blood and Transplant said: 'Graham is living, walking proof of the benefits of organ donation.

'It’s wonderful that he was able to travel to California to give his daughter away on her wedding day when he had been so poorly before his transplant that he needed oxygen 24 hours a day. And that is thanks to his organ donor.

'Many of us say that we would support organ donation but not enough of us tell our families that we would like to give our organs to those that may need them after we have died.

'The sad fact is that less than a third of families will agree to donation going ahead if they don’t know it was what their loved one wanted.

'So for more people like Graham to get the life changing transplant they need, tell your family you’ve decided you’d like to donate your organs.

'Then join the NHS Organ Donor Register to record your decision by visiting organdonation.nhs.uk or calling 0300 123 23 23.'

Relief: Mr Wagstaff and his wife, Christine. She said: 'We all had a brilliant time at the wedding, it was extra special because of Graham¿s miracle gift he received just months before'
