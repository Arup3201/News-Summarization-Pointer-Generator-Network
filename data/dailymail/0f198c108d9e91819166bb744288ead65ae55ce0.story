More than one million babies have reportedly been born to couples who met on Match.com - and now one of the children will be rewarded.

The online matchmaker is offering a $50,000 college scholarship to a 13- to 20-year-old whose parents or stepparents hooked up via the once-spurned dating site. 

To be in the running, American children of '#MatchMade' couples must submit short videos in the next two months describing their parents' love story, including the role of the 19-year-old website.

The general public will then choose the best of 10 finalists through Facebook and Twitter.

#MatchMade kid: Dating website Match.com has introduced a $50,000 scholarship 'connecting the children of Match.com couples to an education'

Hopeful: The Match Group CEO Sam Yagan (pictured) said the pool of potential applicants could number 100,000

Match CEO Sam Yagan said he expects at least 100,000 people to enter, as the stigma around online dating gradually gives way to acceptance.

He said when the site launched nearly 20 years ago, couples were embarrassed to reveal they met online.

'They were making up stories: ‘We met at
 the park,’ or a conference. Now people are pretty open about it,' he said, according to BuzzFeed Business.

'I hope
 this (competition) will encourage kids all around the country to ask, ‘How did you 
meet?’

'People should know that about their parents and talk about their 
love story.'

The scholarship includes a $5,000 vacation award for the parents, and doesn’t consider test 
scores or grades of the children.

The scholarship could be offered every year.

Yagan said he had 'kind of a life-changing moment' about nine months after creating OkCupid in 2003 when a user emailed a thank you note with a picture saying, 'I just had this OkBaby, thanks so much for introducing me to this guy'.

'I’m a math guy, I don’t get emotional about things, but I remember actually pausing and saying, ‘Holy s***, the stuff we do is really important',' he said.

'Because let’s be real - the thing about dating is if there weren’t online dating sites, people would find other ways to meet and get married.

'But those specific humans are only the result of a specific pair we put together … those million babies literally wouldn’t exist.'

Yagan predicts that, as Match commands at least 20 percent of the online dating market, 'it’ll get to the point that 10 percent of all high school students will be Match babies.'
