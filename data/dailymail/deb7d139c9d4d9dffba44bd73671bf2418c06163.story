Officiating was better this Saturday but there were still errors, as there will always be. 

Often errors are understandable and have to be accepted as part of the game, but some are inexplicable and when I was refereeing Premier league games we were told that 'you cannot defend the indefensible'.

There were three clear errors on Saturday and one was understandable but two were not.

Jose Fonte went unpunished for this clear handball despite referee Bobby Madley having a clear view 

Newcastle's Emmanuel Riviere protested to referee Madley, who waves his appeals away

Despite Riviere's impassioned appeals to the official, Newcastle were not awarded the penalty

Referees hope any errors do not affect the outcome of the game but unfortunately it appeared that Bobby Madley failing to award Newcastle a clear penalty when Jose Fonte handled the ball towards the end of game against Southampton did just that. 

Newcastle were trailing 1-2 when a shot was clearly blocked by Fonte’s outstretched arm and an apparently well positioned Madley gave nothing.

It was inexplicable as he had nobody blocking his view and he had no reason to look anywhere else – in other words an 'indefensible' error.

Chris Foy had a different issue at White Hart Lane where he disallowed a perfectly good goal for offside when his assistant, Stuart Burt, signalled that Jan Vertonghen was offside.

Replays clearly showed Jan Vertonghen to be inside his own half as he ran clear to score a disallowed goal

The Belgian's celebrations were cut short when assistant Stuart Burt inexplicably flagged for offside

Vertonghen couldn't believe his bad luck but Tottenham still went on to win the match 

It was a really poor decision as Vertonghen was in his own half when the ball was played forward. 

Luckily it didn't affect the outcome as Tottenham were already 2-1 up and the game finished shortly after the incident but I expect the assistant to miss a game next weekend.

The most interesting incident came in Crystal Palace’s win at Turf Moor and preceded Burnley’s second goal by Danny Ings. 

Burnley’s Scott Arfield was chasing a through ball which Joel Ward was trying to shepherd out of play. Arfield nicked the ball and both players ran off the field. To escape the attentions of Ward, Arfield clearly pushed him which if within the field of play it would have been as easy free kick to give. 

Referee Phil Dowd gave nothing, perhaps thrown by the location of the incident when he should have stopped play for the push and restarted with a drop ball. I could understand this error and again it didn’t affect the final result.

Mike Dean's decision to award Nacho Monreal a penalty after this Vincent Kompany tackle was correct

On Sunday, Mike Dean made an excellent decision in awarding Arsenal a penalty.

Vincent Kompany made no attempt to play the ball and stood up to block Nacho Monreal as he attempted to run into the penalty area.

Watching Kompany — and also watching where he was looking — confirmed the defender’s intentions and Dean will have seen that before pointing to the penalty spot.

Although there was not a huge amount of contact, it was clearly a foul and an unnecessary one for the City skipper to make.
