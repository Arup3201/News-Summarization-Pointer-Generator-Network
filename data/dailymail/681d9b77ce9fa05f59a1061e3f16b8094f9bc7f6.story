In the dog eat dog world of beauty contests, bitchy behaviour is commonplace.

But for these three well groomed models, any such disobedience could see their career bite the dust.

They are the finalists in a contest to find the country’s coolest canine - and on Wednesday night one of them will be crowned Top Dog Model.

But who will be left howling with joy and who will be going home with their tail between their legs? All three are undoubtedly pedigree contenders, but the favourite is Lucky the Chihuahua.

What the two-year-old lacks in stature (at 10in he is by far the least leggy of the finalists) he makes up for in confidence.

Misunderstood: The third finalist is Scarlet the rottweiler who was entered to disprove that the breed is aggressive

Dancing and dressing up are a walk in the park for him - and he has spent the competition bossing around rivals 20 times his weight.

Owner Isa Randle, a dancer and choreographer, who bought Lucky as a 12 week old puppy from a drag artist, said: ‘He loves glitz and glamour and has a good sense of humour.

‘People have a misconception that Chihuahuas are yappy, handbag dogs but they are not like that.'

Miss Randle, 28, of Westbourne Green, West London, prepared Lucky for stardom by taking him to a weekly dancing class for dogs and hopes he may follow in the paw-prints of Pudsey and Ashleigh, winners of Britain’s Got Talent.

But while Lucky found most of the 
challenges simple, he struggled with one task that dogs usually have no 
problems with - getting on a sofa.

‘He
 had to leap on to a leather sofa and sit next to a model. It was four 
or five times taller than he was and he couldn’t jump up so we had to 
have a step,’ she said.

At 
the other extreme is Simba, a Leonberger who resembles, says Dan 
Carrick, 25, ‘a cross between a lion and a grizzly bear’. Aged 15 
months, she weighs 60kg and eats 1kg of raw meat every day.

‘She is the stereotypical gentle giant 
-as soft as they come,’ said Mr Carrick, of Accrington, Lancashire, who 
works at a day school for children with behavioural difficulties.

The final competitor is Scarlett, an 18-month-old Rottweiler owned by Anthony Skordis of Watford, who entered to disprove that the breed is aggressive.

Their latest assignment is a seaside photo shoot before the judges - singer Stacy Solomon, fashion model Lilah Parsons and Hollywood dog agent Addison Witt - make their decision.

Scarlett sported a hanky on her head as she sat on a deckchair for her beach shoot, while Lucky took a fairground ride and Simba sat on a slide.

The show had 2,500 applicants. They were whittled down to 22 who, over the last five weeks, have been battling it out over a series of assignments, contests and photo shoots on the ITV2 show, leaving the final three in Wednesday night’s 8pm show.
