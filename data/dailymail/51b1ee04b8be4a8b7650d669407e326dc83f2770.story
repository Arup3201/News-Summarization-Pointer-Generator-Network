Armed: Judith Kenney, 65, is arrested for taking a loaded gun on a plane

A 65-year-old lawyer managed to carry a loaded hand-gun onto a plane at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport - after security spotted it but failed to stop her.

Judith Kenney boarded the American Airlines jet to Houston which was only stopped after it pulled away from the gate and prepared for take off.

The security scare came after screeners at a security checkpoint had detected the gun in her carry-on computer bag.

But before they could seize the bag and notify police, Kenney had 'picked up the bag and left the checkpoint before the screening process was over,' said a spokesman for Transportation Security Administration, which operates the checkpoints.

Kenney, who was arrested after the incident on Wednesday, carries a handgun for protection but had forgotten that it was in the bag she took on board, her attorney Dallas lawyer David Finn said.

Once security realised their mistake, a massive search was launched and a terminal was shut down in a desperate bid to track down the then unidentified armed passenger. 

A photo of Kenney from a closed-circuit video system was taken and distributed to airport employees.

She was eventually found and taken into custody by DFW Airport police about an hour and 40 minutes later, TSA said.

Failed: Security were supposed to seize the bag once they detected the 38 caliber handgun, shown here in a mock-up sketch

An airline spokesman said Wednesday that the plane was headed for the runway when it returned to the gate and was met by airport police.

Kenney, who specializes in business and corporate law,  was removed from Flight 2385, scheduled to fly to Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport.

The flight, with 128 passengers, was delayed for over an hour and passengers were screened again before the plane took off.

Kenney will be charged with carrying a gun into a place where weapons are prohibited, a third-degree felony in Texas and punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

Delayed: The American Airlines plane, similar to this one taking off at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, was stopped as it prepared to take-off

Kenney is 'absolutely mortified, 
embarrassed,' Finn said. 'She feels terrible for putting the pilot and 
passengers through all that.'

More than 10 flights were also delayed in the security scare after TSA closed DFW's Terminal D.

The terminal, one of five at the airport, is used for both domestic and international flights.

The incident comes amid heightened criticism of TSA.

A soldier arrested on December 31 at the Midland, Texas, airport with C4 explosives in his bag said he probably carried the bomb material on a flight from North Carolina to Texas.

Screeners delayed him after finding and confiscating a smoke grenade but let him on that first flight.
