Michelle Smith, 47, was buying purses with her daughter Krystal, 25, when they heard two gunshots. 

She told the Chicago Tribune: 'It was a pow and a pow. It was a stampede coming down the escalator. 

Authorities reiterated that no one else was in harms way and that the suspect entered the store with the intent to hurt his ex-girlfriend. However they stressed that the store was an active crime scene.

'We just saw people running out and they (the employees) rushed her to get dress,' he told the paper. 'They were adamant about getting us out of the building.'

Janis Tillman who was in the store at the time told NBC Chicago: 

'I was right around the corner when an eyewitness came out. I said, 'What happened?' She said, 'I saw somebody.. I saw the guy pull out a gun, shot her, and then he then shot himself.' She was shaken. Very shaken.' 

Panic: The store was filled with customers at the time during the Black Market sales. Shoppers ran to all exits of the building when they heard the shots ring out
