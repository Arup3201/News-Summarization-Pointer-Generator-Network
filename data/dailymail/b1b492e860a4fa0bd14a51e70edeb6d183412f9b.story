Thanks to the likes of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Millie Mackintosh, liquid detoxes, vitamin drips and juice cleanses are more popular than ever before.

So it's no surprise that the health trend has trickled down to the cocktail world.

Bars across Britain are serving up drink concoctions that not only count towards your five a day, but are low in fat, cholesterol-free, have few calories and are rich in vitamins.

While fresh-squeezed fruit juices have become common on serious cocktail menus, some of the best bartenders are turning to vegetables to incorporate seasonal and bitter components into their drinks.

Five a day: Bartenders are turning to vegetables to incorporate seasonal and bitter components into their drinks like this carrot cocktail at Hix

Shaken, stirred, fried, or simply puréed to a pulp, vegetables are cropping up in our cocktail glasses.

Forget sad-looking sprigs that are little more than decoration — the new drinks put stalks, tubers, and other surprising ingredients at centre stage.

UK Nightlife experts DesignMyNight.com have seen a spike in vegetable tipples on the country’s hottest cocktail lists.

Speaking about the intriguing new rise, DesignMyNight.com co-founder Andrew Webster said: 'The appeal of using veggies in cocktails is bright colours, bold flavours, bursts of refreshment without sickly sweetness and bragging rights among mixologists.

'Hold the soda or sugary mixes and drink the rainbow of vegetable cocktails on offer like carrot and beetroot. Check out our website DesignMyNight.com for more of this season’s most daring drinking trends.

'Now you can get one of your five a day from your Happy Hour fix.'

Marks Bar at London’s Hix in Soho, an apothecary cocktail bar with an eccentric approach to drinking, are at the forefront of the trend.

Lee Potter Cavanagh who designed the long list of cocktails said: 'Seasonal and regional eating is very much in vogue.

'This has trickled down to the booze world as well, as all large food trends seem to. In London this can be a challenge as the season when loads of great fruit is available is relatively short.

'This means that we have to be more creative and you see more and more bartenders thinking outside the box and using ingredients more usually associated with the culinary world, including veggies.'

Punch is making way for parsnips here, with the Atholl Brose on the menu at HIX Soho.

The tipple was born from an old Scotch restorative of the same name and a desire to work with one of the great staples of British cuisine - the parsnip.

'Parsnips are picked and stored year round in large warehouses. With this in mind we infuse Monkey Shoulder blended malt Scotch Whisky as our way of "storing" the parsnips.

'It is then mixed with oatmeal Brose, which is essentially the oat-flavoured water you can strain off porridge. We also add a touch of cream and some spice. It's a rich indulgent drink through which the spicy, sharp flavour of the parsnips poke through,' reveals Cavanagh.

While at HIX Oyster & Chophouse, where food is matched with cocktails, a favourite called Headonism features fennel head juice with a Portuguese white wine and Absolut Elyx Vodka.

'We're constantly mixing things up and have others with beetroot, corn, peanuts, foraged herbs, sea buckthorn and more,' says Cavanagh.
