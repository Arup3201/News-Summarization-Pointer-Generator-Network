Superfit Robert McCloud is closing in on his black belt in martial arts - despite only having one leg.

The 40-year-old amputee, who coined his nickname 'Stumpy' to put people at ease, lost his right leg in a motorbike accident when he was aged 21.

But now he is thought to be the only person in the UK with such a disability to earn a red stripe in mixed martial arts.

And the inspirational father has not just overcome terrible injury, but also bouts of severe depression in order to reach a high level in martial arts.

Mr McCloud, of Swindon, says it was sport and his daughter Jade - also a talented martial artist - which helped him put the horrifying accident, which he openly admits was his fauly, behind him.

He told Martial Arts Illustrated: 'Doctors worked in relays through the night to save my life and said my fitness saved me.

'It was the main reason I survived the accident because martial arts discipline makes you physically and mentally stronger.'

The loss of his leg sent a hitherto active Mr McCloud into a spiral of depression lasting five year.

But, one day, after taking his 
daughter to her martial arts classes, he realised that despite not 
having a right leg, he was capable of many of the excises.

He
 soon got involved in the courses, and such is his progress that he 
holds a realistic ambition to eventually earn a black belt.

And it appears his disability will not prevent his from achieving his goal.

Mr McCloud is regularly put through gruelling training sessions by his instructor Matt Fiddes Martial Arts Academy in Cheney Manor - including routines which would stretch even the fittest of non-handicapped people.

He strongly believes sport has much to offer disabled people in helping them overcome perceived limitations, develop their full potential and get them back into circulation with other people.

Jade, 12, has gone from strength to strength, getting distinctions in her gradings and is on a junior instructors' course. Her ambition is to represent Great Britain at the 2020 Olympics.
