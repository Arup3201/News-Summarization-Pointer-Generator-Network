One very lucky cat is getting a new lease on life thanks to the kind folks at a local hospital.

Biggie, a 37-pound cat whose owner wanted to have him euthanized, has been adopted by the doctors at Riverside Cat Hospital in Riverside, California, who are now focusing on getting the cat healthy once again.

The doctors named their new cat after the late East Coast rapper Notorious B.I.G.

One fat cat: The cat grew obese after his owner, who worked long hours, left him with too much food

'As a vet, I have never heard of a cat this heavy,' the hospital's veterinarian, Dr. Nichole Agarwal, told the Los Angeles Times. 

A normal cat, she explained, weighs around 12 pounds.

Biggie's former owner was frequently working and, not wanting her precious feline to want for anything while she was away, she overfed the cat, leading to Biggie's current obesity problem.

The cat has trouble breathing, is constipated and, even worse, does not purr or meow, which is a sign of stress. 

He is also in so much pain he requires painkillers. 

Nursing him back to health: The staff if hoping that with exercise and a diet high in protein, Biggie can get healthy

Backed up: As seen in this x-ray, the cat is also extremely constipated 

That being said, Dr. Agarwal says the cat moves remarkably well given his weight issues and, with a new diet that is heavy on protein and some serious exercise, she is hoping to save Biggie's life.

It will however be an uphill battle, as most cats who weigh over 30 pounds are never able to bounce back.

Here's hoping Biggie can prove them all wrong.
