What is the essence of Native American identity? That is what photographer Matika Wilbur sought to capture as she travelled the States taking images of hundreds of today's indigenous Americans in their everyday environments. 

Using fundraising website Kickstarter to help her travel 60,000 miles across the USA, Wilbur set out to photograph every recognised indigenous tribe in the United States, often resorting to sleeping on floors in pursuit of the perfect photograph.

The result is Project 562, a collection of stunning images and extraordinary stories featuring people from 161 different nations.

Photographer Matika Wilbur used Kickstarter to fund a project capturing hundreds of today's indigenous Americans in very modern environments. Pictured here are Sky and Talon Duncan who are world champion hoop dancers and part of the three affiliated tribes of Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation

To capture the essence of the ancient culture of these indigenous people the photographer travelled the length and breadth of the country

Matika 'The Messenger' Wilbur, a graduate of the Rocky Mountain School of Photography, is herself from the Tulalip and Swinomish tribes of Washington and set out to celebrate Native Americans in the 21st century.

By celebrating the achievements and heritage of these people groups, Matika says: 'I seek the positivity of Indian country, I look for our heroes; and we have them, they are walking among us. 

'They are health professionals, athletes and culture bearers; they are our farmers that cultivate our indigenous seeds; our fisherman who navigate our sacred waters; our attorneys who protect our sovereignty; our activists that stand in solidarity and our uncles and grandpa’s who fight the good fight to protect our sacred sites and natural resources. And they have a story to tell.'

As part of her project Wilbur photographed the Pechanga tribal culture leader by a 2000-year-old Oak tree, while learning about  controversies over water rights and  violence against native women.

Wilbur wants to change the way native Americans are perceived, one photo at a time, and will continue with the project documenting tribes people for another two years

Some of the people the photographer encountered lived in remote and isolated reservations while others inhabited cities in larger groups

Celebrating the achievements of these groups led the photographer to meet a range of indigenous people from health professionals to athletes and culture bearers

'Sometimes I'll journey to an isolated reservation, other times I'll meet some of the 70 percent of Native Americans living in urban settings', she says. 

So far Project 562 has taken several years and she hopes to complete her documentation of the tribes people in the next two years.

The former international journalist's mission is not the first of its kind: In 1906 photographer Edward S. Curtis was commissioned  to capture the 'disappearing' race. 

However, Matika says her project emphasises the strengths of the original inhabitants of the USA rather than their uncertain future and aims to encourage Americans to become more aware of indigenous communities and combat racism.

Her aim is gaining momentum as the project has so far raised three times as much money as Matika had hoped for. The University of Washington Press has also now offered to publish Matika's portraits and stories in a series of books.

Reflecting on her achievement so far, Matika says: 'The level of success and visibility that Project 562 has garnered has been a direct result of people’s commitment to change the way the world sees Native America.'

The project has gained a lot of media interest and Matika's Kickstarter fundraising project has already raised three times as much money as she was aiming to

To emphasise the rich reality and past of Native Americans Matika gathered their stories while also composing breathtaking images
