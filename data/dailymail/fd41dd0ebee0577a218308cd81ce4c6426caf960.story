Terrifying CCTV footage shows the moment an unsuspecting delivery man was pounced on by a masked gang of chainsaw-wielding robbers.

The footage was released after two members of the gang - who also threatened to cut off their victims' fingers - were jailed earlier this month. 

As the man approached the entrance to Unity Media in Sevenoaks, Kent, he was pushed through the door by a masked robber from behind, before the rest of the gang stormed the building.

He is then shoved against the door inside as the four men encircle him, landing a few punches while one man menacingly wields the chainsaw.

Brute force: The masked gang push their victim up against a door at Unity Media in Sevenoaks - in every attack the gang were armed with weapons including knives, baseball bats, chainsaws and angle grinders

Menacing: A member of the gang can be seen clearly holding a chainsaw - Sussex Police are still searching for other people in the violent group

It is just one clip in a series of CCTV videos showing the violent raids that the gang carried out across the South East during 2010 and 2011.

Dean Shade, 32, from Bromley, was 
sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 10 years and James
Russell, 24, of Crawley was jailed for 11 years.

In
every raid the robbers were masked and were armed with a variety of 
weapons including knives, baseball bats, chainsaws and angle grinders, 
the court heard.

The pair had threatened to cut victims' fingers off if they did not give PIN numbers to their cash cards, the jury was told.

As well as the famous Brit School in 
Croydon - whose past pupils include singers Adele and Amy Winehouse - 
the duo were part of a gang that targeted
businesses across the South East during 2010 and 2011, including home appliance chain Robert
Dyas in Leatherhead.

Police are still looking for the other members of the gang that 'terrorised their victims.'

In
the Brit School incident in November 2010, the gang assaulted a member of 
staff on the school grounds, armed with a crowbar and a baseball bat.

They took him inside and after grabbing two other employees, they bound them with cable ties and put them in a classroom.

They then proceeded to steal £60,000 of IT equipment, including Apple computers from the school’s IT and music labs.

CCTV footage shows them loading the computer monitors into their awaiting van.

The pair were caught in after a 
building search in April 2011 which resulted in crucial evidence being 
found linking Shade and Russell to the robbery series. 

They
also targeted a company in Sayers Common in West Sussex four times, a 
college, and five other businesses in Surrey, West Sussex and Kent.

Russell was arrested in May whilst 
committing an unconnected offence, but Shade was not tracked down and 
arrested until beginning of August last year.

The pair were both convicted of 12 counts of conspiracy to commit robbery.

Russell
had pleaded guilty at Brighton Crown Court on 10 April, and Shade was 
convicted on 11 May after a four-week trial at the same court.

Candice Fox, 29, of The Brindle Way, 
Purley, Surrey, had pleaded guilty on 10 April to converting criminal 
property, photographic equipment stolen in the robberies.

She
was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment suspended for 18 months, and 
was ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid community work.

Detective Sergeant Dennis Phelan of Sussex-based South East Regional Organised Crime Unit said;

'These offences were not committed with any great degree of sophistication.

The
gang simply relied upon brute force and numbers to threaten and 
terrorise their victims, many of whom were tied up and marched round 
their premises before being left alone, restrained in the premises until
the alarm was raised'.

'Due to the threats and level of violence used many of the witnesses who gave evidence did so from behind screens.

'I would like to applaud their courage in doing so. Several remain traumatised to this day by these events'.

Detective Chief Inspector Dave Allen, the senior investigating officer for Operation Attlee, said: 'There are others out there who were involved in these extremely violent offences who have not yet been brought to justice and if the public have information that would enable them to be held to account for the terror they also wrought on their victims in their places of work, I would ask them to speak to the police.'
