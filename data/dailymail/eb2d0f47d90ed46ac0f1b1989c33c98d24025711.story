Chelsea were denied a certain penalty when Matt Targett tripped Cesc Fabregas as the Chelsea man knocked the ball past the Southampton defender.

It was as clear a penalty as you could want to see but referee Anthony Taylor not only denied the league leaders, but he also cautioned the Spaniard for diving.

Chelsea have been criticised a lot of late for their players simulating offences; most recently Branislav Ivanovic on Boxing Day against West Ham.

Prior to that Willian and Diego Costa were both cautioned for simulation against Hull and Gary Cahill should have been and I can only conclude that Taylor was affected by this ‘previous’.

Select group referees meet up regularly and discuss issues and trends to prepare as best they can for their next assignments. Preparation is perfectly acceptable but prejudgment is not.

Chelsea remain top and by definition are still the best team in the league so far; they deserve better from the officials but also need to acknowledge that they have contributed to this problem themselves.
