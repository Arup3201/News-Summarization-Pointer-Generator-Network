Margherita Missoni has opened up her idyllic and eclectically-decored Italian retreat, giving a rare glimpse into the fashion heiress' private life.

The house, located just north of Milan in Lombardy's Varese, is clearly decorated with the 30-year-old's Missoni aesthetic.

The heavily pregnant brand ambassador and model posted several images of her favorite spots in the sun-drenched house on Instagram earlier today as she awaits the arrival of baby Otto, due this week.

The-mother-to-be revealed how the home décor is often influenced by her race car driver husband Eugenio Amos.

'Marriage is compromise- #africanart & #trophies#pictures & #motors,' she captioned one image of an eclectically decorated fireplace that includes a motor sitting within the hearth, as well as colorful vases interspersed among shiny awards.

Describing a 'cozy corner' full of mixed prints, Ms Missoni reveals that the floors were designed and put in by her late grandfather, Ottavio Missoni, who founded the Missoni brand in 1953 with his wife Rosita, and who passed away in May this year.

'Les vintages #red #yellow #green,' Ms Missoni then wrote of a colorful set of cabinets that stand next to a stairway.

Despite Ms Missoni's joy at the impending birth of her first child, the first half of 2013 has been challenging for her family.

Not only did they have to cope with Ottavio's passing, but they had to go through the 
disappearance and subsequent death of Vittorio Missoni, Ms Missoni's uncle and marketing 
director for the family brand.

'Of course, it was especially hard for me because I'm pregnant,' she told The Times in a profile published yesterday.

'I've had a very intense pregnancy, with all the things that have happened, but it wasn't my father; other family members have had a harder time.'

Waiting for Otto: Fashion consultant and stylist Coco Brandolini created these pillows for the new Missoni baby, who will be name Otto

In the details: Ms Missoni is due to go into labor any day now, she tweeted '20 days left' on August 1

She credits the Missoni family's strong bond for getting through the year.

'It has helped that there are so 
many of us and we are so tight. It's easier than if I were having to 
face it all on my own,' she said.

It is the first time a member of the
family has spoken publicly about Vittorio since his plane, which went missing off the coast of Venezuela, was 
discovered in June.

Happily married: Ms Missoni married Eugenio Amos on June 23 in Varese on the family's property

He, his partner, Maurizia, two friends and two crew members 
were en route to mainland Venezuela from the Los Roques archipelago when
their small aircraft went missing on January 4.

Months of searches 
began and the aircraft was eventually found in deep water off the coast 
of the South American country on June 28.
