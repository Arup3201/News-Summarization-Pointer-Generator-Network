A youth football coach used his job to groom boys by inviting them to matches and sending them naked photographs on social media.

Kane Hutchison, 25, was found guilty of inciting two teenage boys to engage in sexual activity on the internet.

The abuse came to light after the mothers of the two boys, aged 13 and 14, recognised Hutchison, from Gateshead, following a conviction last year.

In August 2014, he was jailed for three years for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy after offering to take him to watch a football match.

He invited a youngster to attend an away match between Gateshead and Macclesfield last April and asked him to stay at his house so they could get an 'early start.'

Hutchison forced the boy to share a bed and then molested him. The boy told his mother and he was arrested, hiding in the loft, and prosecuted.

The latest conviction relates to a series of offences, between the summers of 2013-14. 

The first victim knew Hutchison played for a football club in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, and was looking into joining the same club.

Hutchison made contact with the boy on Facebook, where he was advertising for players, and they began to communicate. 

Prosecutor Alec Burns said: 'From the defendant's point of view the communication became more and more sexual.

'He told him he could earn money making pornographic films, he said £350 an hour. He asked (the boy) to send pictures of himself.'

The boy told police Hutchison had communicated with him on 'face tag' and appeared on his computer screen via a webcam committing a sex act on himself.

He encouraged the victim to do the same and made him swap intimate pictures. Hutchison also tried to meet the youngster in a car park, the court heard. 

Hutchison targeted another boy, aged 14, in a similar way between April and August last year.

He lied about his age and started asking the youngster to meet him, offering him £20 to do so. He also sent him intimate pictures of himself on Facebook and Snapchat and encouraged him to do the same.

It came to light when the boy's mother  recognised him as one of her son's Facebook friends.

Hutchison denied two counts of sexual assault but was found guilty after a trial. He can now be identified after a reporting ban was lifted.

Nick Lane, defending, said Hutchison had already had his FA licence, to teach children, revoked.

At the time of his arrest, he was working for a football magazine, he said. 

'He is a man who in the past has done considerable charity work and good work for the community,' he said.

'In 2013 he was part of a team raising money for Help for Heroes who over the course of 24 hours visited 20 Premier League grounds as a way of raising funds for that charity.

'He has used his football contacts in the past to organise a charity match for testicular cancer.

'He has also in the past used his sporting skills working with adults with learning difficulties to encourage them to participate in sport.' 

The trial heard Hutchison had been 'struggling with his sexuality' at the time and has been on a sex offender programme in prison. 

Sentence was adjourned  until next month although Judge John Evans warned it would be a custodial sentence.

He said: 'Having been convicted of these offences I'm going to adjourn sentence now for a pre-sentence report to address the issue of dangerousness.

'You know only a custodial sentence can follow in relation to these matters.'
