Jerry Sandusky, pictured at court last month, was labelled as a 'likely pedophile' in a 1998 report

More than a decade before former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky was charged with over 50 counts of child sex abuse, a psychologist warned university police that he was a 'likely pedophile' who was grooming young children.

In 1998, State College psychologist Dr. Alycia Chambers, the therapist for one of Sandusky’s alleged victims, said in a report his behavior followed a 'pedophile’s pattern of building trust and gradual introduction of physical touch.'

Despite the damning report, obtained by NBC News, no action was taken and Sandusky was allowed to continue in his position unwatched.

The report is contained in the internal 
Penn State files of a 1998 police investigation into claims the former 
coach showered with an 11-year-old boy.

The documents, made public for the first time, raise fresh questions about how the case was handled by the university and local authorities.

Former Penn State coach, who is facing 50 counts of sexually abusing 10 children, was described as a 'likely pedophile' as early as 1998

In 1998, State College psychologist Dr. Alycia Chambers, the therapist for one of Sandusky¿s alleged victims, said in a report, pictured, that his behavior followed a 'pedophile¿s pattern= of grooming

'There was very little doubt in my mind (Sandusky) … was a male predator, someone that was in the process of grooming a young man for abuse,' said Chambers in an interview with NBC News.

'I thought my report was strong enough to suggest that this was somebody who should be watched.'

Chambers described her anger when police informed her last year that Sandusky had allegedly molested 10 other boys, 13 years after her clear warning.

'I was horrified to know that there were so many other innocent boys who had their hearts and minds confused, their bodies violated,' Chambers told NBC. 'It’s unspeakable.'

Ignored: Dr. Alycia Chambers, the therapist for one of Sandusky¿s alleged victims, pictured, said Sandusky was a male predator who needed to be watched

Chambers was the psychologist for a 11-year-old boy, who had met Sandusky through his Second Mile charity for vulnerable children, reports NBC.

The boy is now known as Victim 6 in the criminal case against the former coach due to go to trial this spring.

Having spoken with her client and his mother, Chambers described in her  report how Sandusky had coaxed the boy into the shower after a workout, telling him, 'All the guys do.'

Sandusky then allegedly squeezed the boy in a bear hug tightly from behind while they were both naked and lifted him up under the shower head.

Sandusky had also kissed the boy on the forehead and told him, ‘I love you', according to the report, before inviting him to his house to 'sit on his lap' and go 'online' on his computer.

'My consultants agree that the incidents meet all of our definitions, based on experience and education, of a likely pedophile’s pattern of building trust and gradual introduction of physical touch, within a context of a ‘loving,’ ‘special’ relationship,” Chambers said in her report.

Chambers gave her report to Penn State police Officer Ronald Schreffler in May, 1998.

The police file shows that the investigation continued under the late Ray Gricar, local district attorney at the time, and a second boy who said Sandusky also hugged him in the Penn State showers was interviewed, reports NBC.

Sandusky, pictured outside court last month, was not charged after the 1998 investigation, instead he was advised by police not to shower with children

Victim 6's mother had reported concerns over Sandusky's constant attempt to contact her child, which led to police monitoring two confrontations between her and the coach when he called at boy's home.

On May 19, Sandusky called around and the mother confronted him.

In the transcript, contained in the file obatained by NBC, she asked if the boy and coach's 'private parts' had touched during the bear hug.

 'I don’t think so. … Maybe.' Sandusky has said before admitting that he had one the same thing with other boys.

Sandusky then pressed to talk to the boy again, but the mother declined adn told him not to contact her son again, reports NBC News..

'I understand,' Sandusky replied. 'I was wrong. I wish I could get forgiveness. I know I won’t get it from you. I wish I were dead.'

According to the report, Sandusky, had invited the boy to his house, pictured, to 'sit on his lap' and go 'online' using his 'cool computer'

Investigators had then interviewed Sandusky who acknowledged that he hugged the boy in the shower 'but that there wasn’t anything sexual about it'.

Concluding the investigation, the report states: 'As a result of the investigation, it could not be determined that a sexual assault occurred and Sandusky was advised of such.'

One of the investigators then 'advised SANDUSKY not to shower with any child. SANDUSKY stated that he wouldn’t.'

This was followed by the words: 'Case Closed'.

There are no reasons given in the report for why Gricar ultimately chose not to prosecute Sandusky .

Sandusky retired from Penn State the following year - to spend more time working with Second Mile - but was made a 'professor emeritus' and maintained access to the locker room, where he continued to take young boys to the showers.

'It’s very disturbing,' Walter Cohen, a former Pennsylvania attorney general who reviewed parts of the Penn State police file told NBC News.

'It never should have been ignored. Never.'

'Jerry Sandusky should have been on the watch list,' he said. 'But instead, the case was closed.'
