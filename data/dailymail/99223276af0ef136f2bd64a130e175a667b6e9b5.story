Fresh from crying his eyes out upon his departure from Sevilla, Alberto Moreno was in a better mood on Friday morning with boots in hand as he headed for Melwood to complete a move to Liverpool.

The 22-year-old has all but finalised a £12million move to Anfield after Sevilla relented in Liverpool's long pursuit for the left-back.

Moreno, meanwhile, was pulled from Sevilla's starting line-up to face Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup in Cardiff on Tuesday night and bade a tearful farewell to fans and team-mates after the 2-0 defeat at the Millennium Stadium.

'I am living a strange situation because I'm leaving the club of my life,' Moreno told ABC de Sevilla earlier this week.

'I was always aware of the two teams (trying) to agree (a deal). I never got into that but Sevilla have understood that Liverpool's offer was good and I am going.'

Liverpool are gearing up for their opening game of the Premier League season against Southampton on Sunday.
