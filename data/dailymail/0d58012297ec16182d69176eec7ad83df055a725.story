A 75-year-old man was left lying on the freezing cold pavement for more than two hours waiting for an ambulance after a fall - even though passers-by had called 999 five times.

The pensioner was found on the ground outside Teeside Magistrates' Court in Middlesbrough having fallen and hit his head.

Passers-by found him shortly after the fall - at 7pm on Monday - and covered him with blankets in a bid to keep him warm as temperatures dipped as low as 4C.

But an ambulance did not arrive on the scene until 9.10pm - and only turned up after the people caring for him had called 999 five times.

One man, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'We got here about 7.25pm and saw the man lying on the floor.

'There were quite a few people gathered around him, so we went to get blankets and hot water bottles. We have already put in about four phone calls to the ambulance but they are still not here.'

Around 7.50pm, three Middlesbrough street wardens arrived to offer their help to the man, who is believed to have been from the North Ormesby area of the town.

After a fifth phone call to the emergency services an ambulance arrived at 9.10pm and the pensioner was taken straight to hospital.

Ambulance bosses have apologised and said the service was experiencing 'exceptional pressure' that evening. 

A Met Office spokesman said temperatures that day ranged from 2C to 6C in Middlesbrough but estimated it would have been around 4C at the time of the incident.

One street warden, who wished to remain unnamed, said: 'We got here and the man was just lying there and you could tell he was freezing.

'These three young people were already here and really it was them who did all the work.

'They are students who have just finished a 12-hour shift so they could have just walked past but they stopped to help. 

A spokesperson for North East Ambulance Service said: 'We would like to say sorry to the patient, and apologise for not being able to reach him sooner.

'Over the last few days ambulance services across the UK have been experiencing exceptional pressure, and this has meant that some patients have had to wait longer than normal for a crew to become available.

'There are six levels of alert for UK ambulance services and on Monday it went up to level four, which means extreme pressure.

'Nearly all of the other UK ambulance services are the same.

'We would also like to thank the three students who stayed with the patient during this time for their kindness and concern.'
