A bride-to-be is staging a sit-in at her village church after her dream of walking down the aisle just like her mother, grandmother and great-great grandmother was shattered when the church announced it was to close.

Emily Morton, 21, dreamed of being the fourth generation of her family to have a white wedding in the picturesque Victorian church.

But just weeks before her big day, Emily was shattered when the vicar told her: 'Sorry your wedding is off - we are closing.'

Protest: Emily Morton, pictured with grandmother Celia Murphy, is staging a sit-in at All Saints Church in Rhondda Valleys after the village church closed, dashing her hopes of becoming fourth generation of her family to walk down the aisle

Now she is one of more than 50 villagers
mounting an around-the-clock vigil at All Saints Church to keep it open
for her marriage ceremony.

Tearful Emily said: 'I used to sit in the congregation and look around imagining the day when I would be floating up the aisle. Every little girl dreams about her wedding day.

'My great-great grandmother was married here in 1923 and I was desperate to carry on that tradition just like my mother and grandmother did.

'I was christened here and have been coming to the church all of my life.'

Heartbreaking: 'I could picture every detail of my wedding. But now that has been taken from me', says Emily

'I could picture every detail of my wedding. But now that has been taken from me at the last moment - it is heartbreaking.'

Emily had booked her big day six months ago at the 126-year-old All Saints Church in Maerdy, Rhondda Valleys in South Wales.

She always treasured the family album of pictures showing generations of her family smiling outside the church gates.

Their wedding picture album shows her late great-great grandmother Sophia Ann Barkway in 1923, grandmother Celia Murphy, 61, in 1969 and mum Sarah Morton, 41, in 1988.

But officials decided the church - opened in 1885 in memory of a mining disaster which killed 81 men - would close because it needs 'hundreds of thousands of pounds' in repairs.

Emily was told by the vicar Andrew Davies just weeks ago that the church was due to close - even though it was booked for her September wedding.

She said: 'All my dreams were shattered.

'My grandmother lives across the road from the church. I had planned to walk across to the ceremony in my wedding dress just like my Mum and Gran had done before me.

'I burst into tears thinking that's never going to happen.'

But the battling bride-to-be is not giving up on her dream wedding.

Since the last service on Sunday, Emily and other regulars in the congregation organised a sit-in to keep the church open.

At least four sleep on the church floor at night - and during the day the church is busy with people bringing supplies and signing the protest book.

Emily is hoping church authorities will have a change of heart so she can marry driver fiancé Aaron Jones, 23, on 17 September.

Second generation: Emily's grandmother, Celia Murphy, got married in All Saints Church in 1969

If not she will have to book another village church more than five miles away - but it is half the size of All Saints.

She said: 'Some of our guests may have to stand outside. I'll have to book a car to get me back and from the church too.

'The local choir was booked to sing as I came into the church. I don't suppose there'll be room for them.'

Emily's grandmother Celia is also in the sit-in - and wept as she talked about the family's disappointment.

Family tradition: Emily's mother Sarah Morton was married at the All Saints Church in Maerdy in April 1988, while her great-grandmother Sophia Ann Barkway was married there in 1923

Celia said: 'I have always wanted to see Emily married here.

'As the wedding drew nearer we've all had butterflies in our stomachs.

'Now all that is gone. It is tragic and we want our church kept open.'

Norma Williams, 67, one of the organisers of the sit-in, said: 'We want the Parochial Church Council to sit up and see how strongly people feel about this.

'Everyone in the community is supporting us. The local chip shop is even giving free fish suppers to the protesters sleeping overnight here.'

The Parochial Church Council decided the church needed major repairs costing an estimated £400,000 and was becoming 'too dangerous' to keep open.

Archbishop of Wales Dr Barry Morgan said: 'Nobody wants to see a church closed and my prayers are with members of All Saints.

'It is simply a matter of practicality and pooling our resources together.'
