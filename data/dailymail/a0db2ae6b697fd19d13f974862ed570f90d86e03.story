Ed Miliband last night claimed he had never seen the ‘disastrous’ leaked Labour document advising MPs not to campaign on immigration.

The Labour leader said he had ‘no idea’ who was responsible for the 33-page paper, which suggested ‘moving the conversation on’ to issues such as pressures on the NHS and housing when voters raise it.

But he risked more criticism when what had been billed as a major pre-election speech on Labour policy on immigration – which he forgot to mention in his party conference speech – lasted for less than seven minutes.

'No idea': Ed Miliband said he did not know who wrote a paper advising MPs not to mention immigration

The document, entitled Campaigning Against Ukip, highlighted changes in Labour’s immigration policy since 2010.

It advised MPs not to send out campaign leaflets about immigration to all voters because it could prove ‘unhelpful’.

Party insiders blamed Lucy Powell, Mr Miliband’s new election campaign chief, for allowing an internal strategy document to be issued to MPs most at risk from Ukip without it being checked by senior colleagues.

The paper said immigration was the issue ‘people most often cite’ when explaining why they back Nigel Farage’s party. It advised campaigners to ‘understand and acknowledge’ concerns even if they ‘may not gel with their own’.

But it insisted Labour cannot win a ‘bidding war’ with Ukip, adding: ‘Our focus must instead be moving the conversation on to issues where we have clear policy which tackles the problems people are worried about.’

Senior MPs were furious about the document, which had not been seen by shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper.

One said it was ‘disastrous’ and blamed Miss Powell, put in charge of the day-to-day running of Labour’s election campaign despite being elected only in 2012. Asked if he had seen the document before it was issued to MPs, Mr Miliband said: ‘No. I have no idea who oversaw the document.

‘There were bits that obviously weren’t well-drafted.’

In his less than seven-minute speech in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, the Labour leader said that if elected he would change the law to prevent firms exploiting legal loopholes to employ foreign workers on lower wages than their British counterparts.

‘It isn’t prejudiced to worry about immigration, it is understandable,’ he added.

He later told ITV News that Labour candidates should not shy away from talking about immigration.

‘Absolutely, they should talk to voters about it. Of course you’ve got to engage with people’s concerns,’ he said.

‘We’ve learnt lessons since 2010. I’ve changed Labour’s approach on immigration.’ Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor Damian McBride said Labour’s ‘strategic’ advisers should be beaten ‘savagely around the head’ with a rolled-up copy of the 33-page paper.

He said that such documents should not be ‘done by people who don’t have the sheer bloody common sense to realise how their words will sound if exposed publicly’.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, a critic of the leadership, said: ‘This leaked document on how Labour should try to win back Ukip voters shows lessons are still to be learned.’

But former Labour leadership contender Diane Abbott complained that the party was giving the impression it was ‘running scared of Ukip’.

She added: ‘Labour cannot magic immigrants off the streets without pulling out of the international conventions that commit us to accepting refugees and asylum seekers, or somehow nullifying the citizenship of existing UK passport holders.’

JAMES SLACK'S ANALYSIS: Weasel words that reveal what Labour REALLY thinks 

Ed Miliband yesterday claimed voters should be in ‘no doubt’ about how seriously Labour treats concerns over mass immigration. However a document sent to MPs and activists reveals that, in reality, the party would rather talk about almost anything else. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK examines the key paragraphs.

What the document says: Immigration is the issue people most often cite when explaining support for Ukip, either their own or that of communities and electors more generally ... It does not however follow that campaigning on immigration issues and emphasising our policies in our conversations with electors is always the correct response.

Translation: Labour – for all the recent talk of crackdowns – continues to support large-scale immigration, particularly from within the EU. Party chiefs know that, as a result, they cannot win a bidding war with Ukip so should, wherever possible, avoid the subject altogether – or risk losing seats.

Fightback: Ed Miliband took questions on immigration in a seven-minute speech in Great Yarmouth yesterday

What it says: Writing to electors proactively (i.e. without evidence the elector is concerned about it) about immigration risks undermining the broad coalition of support we need to return to government.

Translation: Don’t prompt voters to think about immigration if they are not already doing so. Leave the topic out of general mailshots. Some Labour voters are supporters of mass immigration. Why upset them with talk of tough new measures needed to win back potential defectors to Ukip?

What it says: Following from this, when we embark on policy messaging around immigration, which is not an area where Labour has the strongest lead over other parties, we should ensure that this messaging is always done in conjunction with other policy areas. The purpose of this is to raise the salience of those issues in which Labour has a much clearer lead and stands to benefit more from their prominence with the electorate.’

Translation: If immigration does come up, change the topic as quickly as possible. If a voter talks about the pressure on the NHS or education, switch the focus to health care and schools more generally. Get on comfortable territory.

What it says: Volunteers and activists must understand and acknowledge electors’ concerns about immigration on the doorstep, which will mean hearing opinions that may not gel with their own. In these cases, it’s important to remember that first phase of re-establishing trust is to listen and understand.

Translation: A weasel-worded way of saying that, while Labour activists will not agree with some people’s desire for stricter border controls, they must try not to sneer, and at least humour them. An insight into the way the modern Labour party feels it may have to condescend to views it finds unpalatable.

What it says: Ukip’s electoral success has come from disenfranchised backers of all three main parties including ‘former Labour supporters who feel that the party has left them behind in pursuit of better-educated, middle-class, white collar voters’.

Translation: During the New Labour years, the party entirely neglected the concerns of ordinary voters, especially over immigration. Now those chickens are coming home to roost and the party has to try to do something about it. The Heywood and Middleton by-election, where Ukip came within 617 votes of snatching the seat, is proof of that.
