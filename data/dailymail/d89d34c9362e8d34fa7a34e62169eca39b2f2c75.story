A 55-bedroom Irish hotel that was originally put on the market with a 4.5million euro (£3.75million) price tag has sold at auction for the knock-down price of just 650,000 euros (£540,000).

The Sandhouse Hotel, overlooking Donegal Bay on Ireland's Atlantic Coast, sold to its manager of 20 years Paul Diver at the reserve price.

The 50-year old establishment was put into liquidation in 2009 after its previous owners failed to sell it following Ireland's economic collapse.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair spent several summer holidays staying at the hotel as a child.

And Mia Farrow and Woody Allen used it as their holiday hideaway before their divorce in 1992.

Mr Diver said he was 'delighted' at the lack of interest in the property and that he believed the sale will secure the jobs of its 50 staff.

He told the Irish Independent: 'It's just a total adrenalin rush. I can't believe it. It's been a long, long road but we have made it.'

Since the crash of the Celtic-Tiger economy in 2007-2008, average house prices have fallen by more than 60 per cent with commercial properties falling at a similar rate.

Mr Diver believes the hotel's prime location off the Rosnowlagh beach will remain a lure for visitors.

The beach has played host to the European Surfing Championship on several occasions.
