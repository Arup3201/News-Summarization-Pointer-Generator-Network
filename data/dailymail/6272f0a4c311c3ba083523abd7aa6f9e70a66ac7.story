Robert Kennedy was thousands of miles away when his sister Kerry was acquitted of drugged driving this morning since he presented an award at a humanitarian event in Hollywood Thursday night.

He was seen cozying up to his actress girlfriend Cheryl Hines at the Unite4: Good humanitarian awards event on Thursday night and the pair happily posed for photos together on the red carpet.

The couple started seeing each other since 2012 and their relationship was put under scrutiny after his estranged wife Mary Richardson Kennedy killed herself in May 2012.

Robert has since relocated to California, leaving the family home that belonged to Mary in New York and starting a life together with Hines, 48.

The two avoided public events in the wake of his wife's death, but have been seen at a number of ceremonies in recent months.

He was at her side when she was awarded her plaque on the Hollywood Walk of Fame last month, and now it was his turn to take the spotlight.

Kennedy, who has campaigned for environmental causes for years, was one of the presenters at Thursday night's ceremony.

The event was hosted by Andy Samberg and brought together figures like Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese and Julia Louis-Dreyfus for the formal dinner and awards gala on the Sony Pictures Studio lot.

'I would like to thank Variety for coming up with another award because our stiletto heels spend far too many nights during the year in their little silk bags,' joked Louis-Dreyfus, poking fun at the frenzy of events that cluttered the weeks leading up to Hollywood's biggest night on March 2.

Louis-Dreyfus received the creative commitment in television award for her work with Heal the Bay, an environmental advocacy non-profit dedicated to making Southern California coasts clean.

Forest Whitaker presented the unity recognition award to former President Bill Clinton, who gave the evening's keynote address.

In his address, Clinton mentioned the positive influence of the late Nelson Mandela.

Steve Coogan, who starred in the Oscar-nominated 'Philomena,' presented the real Philomena Lee with the everyday hero award.

After receiving his honor, De Niro handed 'his partner in crime,' Scorsese, the creative conscience award for his work on film preservation through The Film Foundation.

'Are you kidding,' joked De Niro. 'The creative conscience award? Have you not seen Wolf of Wall Street?'

Scorsese said that since his foundation's inception in 1990, around 640 films have been restored and preserved.

For her work as a UNICEF ambassador, singer Selena Gomez was awarded the young humanitarian award. She lauded fellow do-gooder, Demi Lovato, who received the evening's young luminary honor, saying,

'I am so thankful for you for inspiring me every day. We're here at 21 years old using our voice to help this generation, though sometimes I feel like we're the only ones holding down the fort.'

Both Lovato and music visionary recipient, Alicia Keys, performed at the affair.

William H. Macy, Jada Pinkett Smith, Eva Longoria and Wilmer Valderrama were presenters.
