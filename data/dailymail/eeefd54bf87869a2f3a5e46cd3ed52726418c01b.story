A midwife who treated a woman with 'contempt' as she gave birth to a stillborn baby has been sacked from the troubled health trust where she worked.

Terrai Mutasa laughed at Allyson Childs for requesting painkillers amid the trauma of her labour and while doctors fought in vain to resuscitate 9lb 10oz Layla-Grace, who had been born with the umbilical cord around her neck.

In response to her request for a Caesarean at Queen's Hospital in Romford, the midwife allegedly said: 'Do you think that won't hurt? Believe me it will.'

Ms Childs said: 'I am angry and 
disgusted. I've been let down massively by the hospital. I want a full 
inquiry. No woman should have to go through what I did.'

Queen's
Hospital has apologised to Ms Childs over this and a further complaint 
about the 'insensitive conduct' of an unnamed nurse who sent Ms Childs 
'rude' texts hounding her to return medical files.

The trust running Queen's is under fire over its maternity care after five women died in 18 months.

Complaints against Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust rose by a third from 2009 to 2010.

Ms Childs claimed that during the traumatic birth Ms Mutasa treated her contemptuously.

Ms Childs further claims Ms Mutasa told her mother to 'find the scissors' to cut the umbilical cord during the birth on September 24.

An internal report also reveals the hospital added to the family's distress by losing Layla-Grace's pink bib. Queen's apologised for this and for leaving the body in a bloodstained cot.

The hospital's chief executive Averil Dongworth met Ms Childs and her partner Steve, 25 - who await the results of a post-mortem examination - and told them she was 'moved and saddened' by their experience.

She said in a statement: 'I offered Ms Childs and her family our sincere apologies. We will not tolerate poor standards of care.

'The midwife involved in Miss Childâ€™s care is no longer working at the trust.'

Ms Mutasa was referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council, which will probe her competency to practise.
