A diplomatic row has erupted between Germany and Hungary after Angela Merkel said she wouldn’t be ‘sending in the cavalry’ to sort out the fellow EU country’s problems.

Hungary’s prime minister responded by referring to the Nazi invasion of his country in 1944, saying: ‘The Germans already sent the cavalry once, and in the form of tanks.

Viktor Orban told listeners to his weekly radio broadcast: ‘Our request would be that they did not send them again. It wasn’t a good idea back then and it didn’t work.’

Hungarian prime minister Viktor Oban provoked anger in Berlin after comparing Angela Merkel's polices to methods used by the Nazis during the Second World War

Germany is one of several EU nations 
which are increasingly concerned about Hungary’s oppression of the free 
press and its continual tinkering with its constitution.

Mr Orban’s Fidesz party has used its 
two-thirds majority to push through controversial laws which critics say
weaken the democratic system of checks and balances on the government’s
power.

Last week Mrs Merkel vowed to ‘do 
everything to put Hungary onto the right path. But we won’t be sending 
in the cavalry straight away’.

In Germany her choice of words was 
seen as a domestic reference to Peer Steinbrueck, the leader of the 
opposition party, who is running against Merkel in September’s general 
election.

He had upset Switzerland in 2009 when
he called for governments to use ‘the whip’ against Switzerland’s ‘tax 
havens’, adding that the Alpine nation faced the threat of the 
‘cavalry’.

Merkel's comments referred to those made by Peer Steinbrueck, who upset Switzerland when he said the 'cavalry' should be sent in

Orban responded to Merkel's cavalry 
remarks a day later by referring to German tanks which invaded Hungary 
during the war in 1944.

'The Germans have already sent 
cavalry to Hungary - they came in form of tanks. Our request is that 
they don't send any. It didn't work out,' Orban told state broadcaster 
Kossuth Radio.

This comment and a report on Spiegel 
Online headlined 'Orban accuses Merkel of using Nazi methods' irritated the German government.

Today, German Foreign 
Minister Guido Westerwelle accused Orban of 'a deplorable
derailment which we clearly reject.'

Human Rights Watch 
urged the European Union last week to ensure that Hungary changes its constitution.

It wants laws to be brought them in line with international norms on issues
ranging from independence of the judicial system to the rights of the 
homeless.

Orban's Fidesz party has used its 
two-thirds majority in the legislature to push through laws, including a
new constitution, which critics say weaken the democratic system of 
checks and balances on the government's power.

Yesterday Germany’s foreign minister accused Mr Orban of ‘a deplorable derailment which we clearly reject’.

The president of the European Parliament, Germany’s Martin Schulz, also expressed irritation.

He said: ‘The content of his statement is so ridiculous that one doesn’t even have to comment on it.’

And the Hungarian opposition condemned Mr Orban’s comment as a ‘coarse joke’.
