A piano teacher awaiting a jury's verdict on charges claiming he sexually assaulted an underage student has shot himself outside a New Hampshire courthouse, court officials say.

Authorities say 75-year-old John Goodwin, of Atkinson, went on trial this week on six counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault.

Prosecutors said that Atkinson, who pleaded not guilty, repeatedly sexually assaulted a student, who is now 24 years old, according to SeaCoastOnline. 

John Goodwin, 75, shot himself outside of Rockingham County Superior Courthouse on Friday morning while jurors were deliberating claims that Goodwin had sexually assaulted an underage student

The former student testified he didn't come forward until 2013 because he was embarrassed, according to WMUR. 

The station reports Goodwin's lawyer acknowledged his client was 'touchy-feely,' but he didn't commit a crime. 

Court officials say the jury was deliberating when Goodwin shot himself late Friday morning near his car in a parking lot outside Rockingham County Superior Courthouse. He wasn't in custody.

Court officials say Goodwin was airlifted to a hospital with life-threatening injuries from the self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to WPTZ. His health status has not been immediately disclosed.

As of Friday afternoon, jurors were still deliberating, but court officials would not say if the jurors knew about the shooting.  

The New Hampshire Attorney General's Office is expected to release more information about the incident Friday evening.
