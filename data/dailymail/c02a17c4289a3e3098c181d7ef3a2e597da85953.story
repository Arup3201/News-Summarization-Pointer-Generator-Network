Wanted: Arsene Wenger hoped to add Casillas to his squad but the goalkeeper is said to be 'very happy'

After Lukasz Fabianski signed for Swansea on a four-year deal, the only first-team goalkeeper left at the Emirates is Wojciech Szczesny.

Wenger hoped to persuade Casillas, who was only selected in cup competitions for Madrid last season with Diego Lopez preferred in La Liga, to switch to north London.

But Ancelotti said: 'Casillas is very happy to stay here and we are very happy that he wants to stay.'

When asked about who would be first choice next season Ancelotti said he had not made up his mind.

'We have not thought about this after the victory (in the Champions League final) because everybody went on holiday.'

On Morata, though, the signs are positive for Arsenal. Ancelotti explained: 'The player wants to look for an opportunity where he can play more and the club agrees with this.

'If he leaves it would be good that he would have the chance to play. If Morata goes we have to think about getting a young forward with the same characteristics.'

If Madrid sell Morata then they would look for a deal with a buy-back clause.

The 21-year-old has not been given as many opportunities as he would hope at the Santiago Bernabeu, with fellow youth team graduate Jese ahead of him in the pecking order.

On the lookout: Morata's availability will be welcomed by Wenger as he prepares his summer shortlist
