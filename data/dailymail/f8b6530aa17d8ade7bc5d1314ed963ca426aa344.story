Veteran actress Jean Alexander, whose role as Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street made her a household name, was rushed to hospital last week, it has been revealed.

Ms Alexander, 88, who lives in Southport, has suffered numerous health problems in recent years.

She was seen being taken away in an ambulance  by a concerned neighbour.

Legendary: Jean Alexander with her on-screen husband, Stan, played by Bernard Youens

Jean Alexander played Rover’s Return cleaner Hilda Ogden from 1964 to 1987, during which time she became one of the most-loved characters the soap has ever had.

She was voted the greatest TV character of all time in a Radio Times poll and her trademark headscarf and curlers made her one of the most recognisable, too.

While Hilda was often used to bring light relief to the soap, the moment she cried over the sight of her dead husband’s glasses is thought by some to be one of the most powerful moments in soap history.

Hilda had an on-screen husband called Stan, played by Bernard Youens, and the pair were known for their bickering.

But underneath the surface tension was a rock-solid marriage that never wavered.

A survey by NTL: Home granted them the accolade of Britain's top romantic TV couple in 2002.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'The ambulance crew came to her home. I hope she's okay.' 

The actress was under observation for a number of days, but has since been released, according to the Liverpool Echo.

The Mirror had earlier claimed that the actress had died, but has since retracted the story.

Ms Alexander starred on Coronation Street for 23 years,  eventually leaving the show in 1987.

She admitted that while she understood that the show had to move on, she longed for the days when the street was gentle, funny and human.

The retired actress felt the humour has all but gone out of the soap.

Ms Alexander also said that she would not return to Coronation Street after bowing out following the death of her on-screen husband Stan.

She told the Daily Express: 'It is more than 25 years since she [Hilda] left the Street and I have been asked a number of times to do an episode but she wouldn't be the "old scrubber" she was, now.

'Hilda had a bit of sense in her head; she would have adapted, smartened herself up and learned to speak better.

She added: 'People would want her to be the old Hilda. I couldn't do that.'

The veteran star was last seen on screen in Last Of The Summer Wine, which ended in 2010.
