Roy Hodgson is modestly paid by extravagant FA standards compared to some other recent England managers - but with earnings of £3.5m per year he will still be the second-highest boss among the 32 nations at this summer’s World Cup.

And the only other manager earning more is Hodgson’s England predecessor, Fabio Capello, who is now in charge of Russia and taking home almost £7m a year.

A MailSport review of what the managers of the World Cup nations earn shows that seven bosses are earning more than £2m per year as they seek the biggest prize in their global game for their employers, who are increasingly not their own nations.

Money man: Former England boss Fabio Capello will be the highest earning manager at the World Cup

Laughing all the way: Hodgson may be on less than his predecessor, but he still makes £3.5m a year 

Capello’s £6.7m guaranteed pay puts him far and away in first place with almost double the salary of Hodgson.

Two years with Russia will earn Capello £14m in addition to the £24m he earned as England boss with the FA between the start of 2008 and early 2012.

Italy’s Cesare Prandelli (£2.58m a year) is the third biggest earner ahead of Luiz Felipe Scolari of Brazil in fourth (£2.4m), Ottmar Hitzfeld of Switzerland in fifth (£2.2m), Joachim Low of Germany in sixth (£2.1m) and Vicente Del Bosque of holders Spain in seventh (£2.02m).

Six of the 32 managers have worked in England as either players or managers: Capello, Hodgson, Scolari, the USA’s Jurgen Klinsmann, France’s Didier Deschamps and Iran’s Carlos Queiroz.

Louis van Gaal of Holland is set to be added to that list them when he starts work for Manchester United later this summer.

The most common nationality of manager at the World Cup will be German, with Germans in charge of Switzerland (Hitzfeld), Germany (Low), USA (Klinsmann) and Cameroon (Volker Finke).

Contrasting fortunes: Italy boss Prandelli is third in the list but World Cup winner del Bosque is only seventh

Premier bosses: Deschamps and Klinsmann are among the coaches who played in England

There will also be three Italians (in charge of Russia, Italy and Japan), three Agentineans (in charge of Chile, Colombia, Argentina), three Portuguese (in charge of Portugal, Iran and Greece) and three Colombians, although none of them in charge of Colombia (with Honduras, Ecaudor, Costa Rica).

Eighteen of the 32 nations will be managed by coaches from their own country and 14 by foreigners.

The five lowest-paid managers are all nationals of their own countries, and in order of smallest pay are Miguel Herrera of Mexico (£125,000 per year), James Kwesi Appiah of Ghana (£150,000), Niko Kovac of Croatia (£162,000), Safet Susic of Bosnia (£210,000) and Stephen Keshi of Nigeria (£234,000).

Kovac’s salary for managing Croatia is the closest in size to the average citizens income in his country, being ‘only’ 19 times as much as the average Croatian earns - using United Nations per capita income figures as a guide. The average Croatian makes £8,767 a year.

Above average: Kovac (left) is the closest to earning the national average, unlike Lamouchi (right)

Sabri Lamouchi of the Ivory Coast, a Frenchman with a Tunisian heritage, earns the salary that is most extreme compared to the average wage in his country of employment.

His annual pay of £618,125 is a staggering 795 times as much as the average annual pay of £778 per year in the Ivory Coast - or £14.96 per week.

Capello is the next most lavishly rewarded when measured in the same way, earning 763 times as much as the average Russian person (£6,693,750 against £8,773).

Roy Hodgson earns ‘only’ 143 times as much as the average England fan.

The combined annual salaries of the 32 bosses add up to £39.1m, making the average pay £1.2m.  All the managers who have worked in England previously are picking up £1.25m per year or more.
