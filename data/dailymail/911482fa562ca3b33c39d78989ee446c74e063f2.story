Boss Ronald Koeman refused to blame Fraser Forster after Southampton’s Barclays Premier League top four charge received a dent at Aston Villa.

The England goalkeeper’s gaffe gifted Gabby Agbonlahor the opener in the 1-1 draw at Villa Park before Nathaniel Clyne rescued a point for the disappointing Saints.

It was just the sixth goal second-placed Southampton have conceded in the league and meant they are six points behind leaders Chelsea.

But Koeman insisted Forster’s first-half mistake - when he came and missed Ciaran Clark’s long clearance - is a one-off.

He said: “He is a great goalkeeper and that doesn’t change after this mistake.

“It doesn’t usually go against us and it was a misunderstanding. He came out, stopped and if you stop you are too late.

“He is clever enough to understand that kind of mistake.

“But we deserved our goal and we had the patience in the second half. We knew they would defend and keep their organisation.

“It was late but well deserved. We played more football than they did. Every game in the Premier League is difficult and they were missing some key players and in a difficult situation and maybe that’s more dangerous than normal.

“After being 1-0 down it was more difficult but we got a point and for confidence it was important.”
