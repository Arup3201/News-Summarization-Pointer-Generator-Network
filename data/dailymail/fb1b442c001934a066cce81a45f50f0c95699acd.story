When Fiona Bruce’s team of experts on the BBC show Fake or Fortune examined this seascape, they were convinced they  had found a lost masterpiece by John Constable.

Delighted owner Gillie Dance was told the painting, Yarmouth Jetty, could be worth as much as £250,000, and a smiling Bruce declared: ‘Well I don’t think that could have gone any better really.’

But boat experts are now challenging the verdict – claiming the experts made a ‘glaring mistake’.

The original: Constable's painting of Yarmouth Jetty hangs in the Tate

During the show, Constable specialist Sarah Cove told Bruce: ‘I think there are sufficient things that look like Constable that if I had to come down on one side of the line or the other I would say I do think it is a Constable.’

The painting, which had been stored under a bed for decades, underwent further analysis by Anne Lyles, a former curator at Tate Britain – who said she was ‘convinced it was likely to have been painted by John Constable’.

However yachting experts say the boats that the painting depicts were not seen in British waters until almost a century after Constable’s death in 1837.

Dan Houston, the editor of Classic Boat magazine, pointed out that three of the watercraft have a sail and mast arrangement known as a Bermudan rig, first tested in these seas in the 1920s.

The boat in the middle of the picture also looks like a J class from the 1930s because of its ‘spoon bow’ hull, he added.

Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘I don’t think that Constable was blessed with exceptional foresight. It seemed as if the BBC was intent on proving this was a Constable, regardless of the facts.’

And Jamie Campbell, an historian at the Royal Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club in Lowestoft, said: ‘Not only was the rig wrong but the sail colour wasn’t authentic either. The picture may be technically correct as a painting but I fear the content just isn’t right.’

A Fake or Fortune spokesman said: ‘This information is part of a larger story which we will consider including in future episodes.’
