James
 Dasaolu has spoken of his disappointment at missing out on the 
Commonwealth Games and expressed his desire to represent Great Britain 
at the European Championships — even if it is only in the 4x100metres 
relay.

The
 26-year-old, the second quickest Briton of all-time with a 100m 
personal best of 9.91sec, was not even considered to pull on an English 
vest in Glasgow because he had not raced outdoors before the selectors 
met on June 2.

Dasaolu
 missed three weeks of training after suffering a hamstring injury in 
February and so elected to miss last weekend’s Sainsbury’s British 
Championships and open his season in a ‘B’ race in Lausanne, Switzerland
 last Thursday instead.

Reaction: Dasaolu looks back after winning his 100m 'B' race in 10.03secs in Lausanne

His winning time of 10.03sec was the second fastest by a British man this year but Dasaolu must still convince British selectors to pick him over Chijindu ‘CJ’ Ujah for next month’s European Championships in Zurich. European junior champion Ujah, 20, has clocked 9.96sec in 2014 and competes in his first Diamond League meeting in Paris on Saturday.

Dasaolu said: ‘I was eligible (for the Commonwealth Games). Even if I didn’t warrant to go in the 100m at the time I still would have liked to have been part of the relay team but I was overlooked.

‘I don’t know why, you’ll just have to ask the selection committee, but I would have liked to have been part of a home Commonwealth Games.

‘I don’t know about the Europeans. That’s down to the selectors so I just have to wait and see for another week or so.

‘I wasn’t surprised by CJ’s time. We always saw he had potential but he is always one of these athletes that ran a little bit hurt, so it shows what he can do when he is fit and healthy. He ran sub-10, which is good to see.

‘I’m happy to represent my country in any
 form so a vest is a vest and a medal is a medal so yes, I’d be more 
than happy (to go to Zurich if only selected in the relay).’

Dasaolu
 faced some criticism for skipping last weekend’s trials, which saw 
Dwain Chambers win his eighth 100m British title and gain European 
selection in 10.12secs, but he insisted his cautious approach will bring
 more long-term gain.

The sprinter’s career has been marred by injury
 but the disappointment so clearly etched on his face on Thursday showed
 the shape Dasaolu feels he is now in.

He will compete again next 
Friday (July 11) at the Sainsbury’s British Grand Prix in Glasgow 
against a much more competitive field, hoping to register a time to 
really give the selectors something to think about when they meet the 
Monday after.

Dasaolu said: ‘10.03sec is my quickest opener to a season so I can’t really complain too much.‘I
 really wanted to compete at the British Champs. If they had been this 
week, I would have competed, but I didn’t want to take the risk.

‘My
 goals are the World Championships and the 2016 Olympics in Rio so I 
don’t want to risk any injury that would jeopardise the rest of my 
career.

‘We just didn’t want to take any risks. I could have been 
racing three or four weeks ago but there was a possibility that I could 
have torn a hamstring so I decided to take the maximum time to recover 
and be fit and healthy.

‘I did miss it, though. Racing is the whole point and I’m glad to be back.’
