As Murray mania picks up across Briton, one woman has to remain calm and collected.

Devoted Kim Sears returned to Wimbledon once again to support boyfriend Andy Murray in the second round of his title defense after his spectacular win on Monday.

Kim, 25, wore a summery blue and white swallow block dress from Hobbs which she paired with Burberry suede wedge sandals in a dusky rose colour.
