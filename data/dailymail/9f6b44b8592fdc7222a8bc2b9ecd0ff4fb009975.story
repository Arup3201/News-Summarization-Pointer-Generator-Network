NASCAR champion Tony Stewart was given a standing ovation on Sunday night as he returned to the track for his first race since he struck and killed Kevin Ward Jr three weeks ago in upstate New York.

Stewart, 43, walked out during driver introductions to a chorus of cheers - the loudest and longest for any driver - before the Oral-B 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Sunday.

The response even drowned out the public address announcer's introduction of Stewart.

Hero's welcome: Tony Stewart's introduction received the loudest cheers of the night at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Sunday night as he took his customary lap around the track in the back of a pickup truck

Stewart waved a couple times and shook hands with each person on the stage before taking the customary lap around the track in the back of a pickup.

Starting the race in twelfth spot, Stewart ran in the top 10 early in the race, getting as high as fourth. 

Then, on lap 122 after a restart, Kyle Busch's No. 18 machine got loose coming out of turn two and banged into Stewart, sending both cars against the wall. Stewart carried on but dropped back to 21st. 

'We just got run over big-time!' Stewart radioed his crew. 'I hit the wall pretty hard there.'

In the half-hour before the start of the race, Stewart, standing beside his No. 14 Chevrolet, was visited by sponsor representatives Johnny Morris of Bass Pro Shops and Rusty Rush of Rush Enterprises, who earlier on Sunday had told USA TODAY Sports 'We stand by Tony'.

Also in the crowd were Eddie Jarvis, Stewart's long-time business manager; Stewart-Haas Racing executive vice president Brett Frood; and Mike Arning, Stewart's public relations director.

Arning motioned for a member of a network camera crew to remove a boom microphone from near the heads of Stewart and his associates. The group gathered in a circle and prayed before Stewart climbed back into his car for the first time after skipping three races. 

On Friday, NASCAR granted him a waiver to participate in the Chase for the Sprint Cup. 

So despite him missing time in the car during the regular season, Stewart will make the 16-driver championship field if he wins next weekend at Richmond International Raceway. 

‘This is a sadness and a pain I hope no one has to experience,’ Stewart had said in his return to the track on Friday.

During a brief news conference, Stewart read a statement that his team said he wrote himself, his voice quivering and eyes glassy.

He declined to take questions, saying he couldn't comment while law enforcement was still investigating and wasn't sure he was up to discussing what happened even if he could.

While NASCAR requires its drivers to compete in every event to make the playoff, Stewart was granted a waiver that is normally applied to a driver who misses a race for medical reasons

‘This is something that will definitely affect my life forever,’ Stewart said. ‘That being said, I know that the pain and mourning that Kevin Ward's family and friends are experiencing is something that I can't possibly imagine.’

About the time Stewart was speaking on Friday, authorities in New York said that their probe into Ward's death will last at least two more weeks. No decision has been made into possible charges. 

While NASCAR requires its drivers to compete in every event to make the playoff, Stewart was granted a waiver that is normally applied to a driver who misses a race for medical reasons.

Mike Helton, president of the governing body, said NASCAR made the decision after consulting with third-party experts who ‘were relevant under these circumstances.’ He would not elaborate.

‘We want to join everybody in racing in welcoming Tony back,’ Helton said. ‘He's a great asset to NASCAR. He's a great champion, a great participant in our sport.’

Asked if NASCAR was making the proper decision in giving out a waiver, rival driver Denny Hamlin wavered a bit.

‘It's a very vague thing,’ he said. ‘It's tough to say what's considered medical and not.’

There was no word from Ward's family on Stewart's return. A woman who answered on Friday at the home of Kevin Ward Sr. said the family would not be commenting.

During an August 9 sprint-car race in Canandaigua, New York, Stewart and Ward bumped while racing into a turn, sending Ward's car spinning. 

The 20-year-old climbed from his wrecked machine and wandered onto a darkened track in a black racing suit, clearly wanting to make his displeasure known to the three-time NASCAR champion.

One car appeared to swerve to avoid Ward, but he was struck by the back right tire of Stewart's car.

The 43-year-old Stewart pulled out of the race at nearby Watkins Glen the next day, and then skipped events at Michigan and Bristol. 

His team said he needed time to grieve; some wondered if he was feeling guilty, that perhaps a driver known for his short fuse wanted to frighten a young competitor who had the nerve to call him out over a racing crash.

‘I've taken the last couple of weeks off out of respect for Kevin and his family and also to cope with the accident in my own way,’ Stewart said.

‘It's given me the time to think about life and how easy it is to take it for granted. I miss my team, my teammates and I miss being back in the race car, and I think being back in the car this week with my racing family will help me get through this difficult time.’

He mentioned Ward's parents and three sisters by name, saying he wanted them ‘to know that every day I'm thinking about them and praying for them.’

Stewart-Haas Racing executive vice president Brett Frood said the driver sent flowers and a card to Ward's family around the time of the funeral. He hopes to meet with them at some point.

‘He's been very respectful of them and their time to grieve,’ Frood said. ‘It's important for Tony to spend time with the family. I do think that will happen at the appropriate time.’

In the meantime, it's back to racing.

‘Being in that car,’ Harvick said, ‘cures a lot of problems for a short time.’
