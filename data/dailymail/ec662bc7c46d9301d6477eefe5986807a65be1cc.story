Orphan to cancer: Roxanne will go and live with her aunt after her father dies. Mr Allen has set up a trust fund for her

A four-year-old girl who lost her mother to cancer, will soon lose her father to the condition as well.

Roxanne Allen's mother Chloe was diagnosed with breast cancer in August 2009 and died last November.

Her father Mike was diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer in June 2011 and doesn't know how long he has left to live.

However, he is determined to make his last months with his daughter special. He has also set up a trust fund in Roxanne's name to provide for her future.

The 49-year-old baker from 
Bridgehall, Stockport, said: 'I live day-by-day and enjoy every minute I
can. I am making plans so that Roxanne is okay and has a stable future.

'Chloe and I have the same attitude, to get on with life and enjoy it. We have never hidden anything from Roxanne.

'She
has seen me and her mum at our worst and was at Chloe's bedside when 
she passed away. She hasn't asked me about my death yet, but she knows I
am not well.'

The couple married in January 2009, just seven months before Chloe was given the bombshell diagnosis of breast cancer.

She was given the all-clear after a 
mastectomy but then Mike was diagnosed with a rare form of lymphoma, or 
blood cancer, in June 2011.

The family went on holiday to Disneyland Paris last June for Roxanne's birthday, as they didn't think Mr Allen had long left.

Tragic family: Mike with his daughter Roxanne, son Dean from a previous relationship and his wife Chloe who died in November

He said: 'I was in a wheelchair for the trip and Chloe was pushing me around - that's how well she was.'

But a few months later, they found Chloe's cancer had returned - and had spread 'everywhere in her body.'

The
last time Mike saw his wife alive he had left her to get his final 
treatment at The Christie on November 14. She passed away at home while 
Mike was in hospital.

Mike,
who also has a 16-year-old son called Dean, said: 'All the signs had 
been that I would die first. It is shocking to think how quickly she 
deteriorated.

'I helped Chloe plan her funeral and we both sat down and planned mine. She was a good organiser.

'It isn't about being brave but doing what I am supposed to do for a four-year-old who needs me. I just have to get on with it.'

He said that his daughter has coped amazingly well with the trauma.

'She
looks out at night time and sees the brightest star and says "there is 
mummy" and says good night to her, it keeps our spirits up,' he said.

Mr Allen, whose condition is terminal, said he talks to a photo of his wife each night and tells her is will be 'joining her soon.'

The widower has arranged for Roxanne to live with his wife's sister, Jane, 51, in Offerton.

The family are in the process of setting up a fundraising account. Those interested in contributing to the fund should send an email with the subject 'Roxanne Allen' to katenkai@live.co.uk
