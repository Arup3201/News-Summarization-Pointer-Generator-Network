Florida resident Michael Dunn accused of shooting dead an unarmed teenager in an argument over loud rap music was convicted tonight of lesser counts after the jury failed to come to an agreement on a first-degree murder charge against him. 

After 30 hours of deliberations, the 47-year-old defendant was found guilty of three counts of second-degree attempted murder while a mistrial was declared on the most serious count.

The 12 jurors also found Dunn guilty of one count of shooting into an occupied car.

Verdict reached: Florida jurors found Michael Dunn, 47, guilty of second-degree attempted murder in the 2012 killing of unarmed teen Jordan Davis

Dunn showed no emotion as the verdicts were read. Davis' parents each left the courtroom in tears.

'He's in disbelief, and it has not sunk in,' Dunn's attorney, Cory Strolla, told reporters following the verdict.

Victim: Jordan Davis, 17, was shot and killed in November 2012 at a Jacksonville gas station

Strolla also said that Dunn's elderly 
parents were 'devastated' by the outcome of the trial, adding, 'I have 
no earthly clue what I could have done differently.'

Earlier
 in the day, jurors said in a note to Judge Russell L. Healey that they 
were having trouble reaching agreement on the murder charge. He asked 
them to continue their work, and they went back to the deliberation room
 for two more hours.

'I've 
never seen a case where deliberations have gone on for this length of 
time ...' Healey said after the verdict. 'They've embraced their civic 
duty and they are to be commended for that.'

Dunn
 claimed he acted in self-defense, testifying he thought he saw a 
firearm pointed at him from the SUV as Davis yelled insults at him and 
the argument escalated. No weapon was found in the SUV.

Dunn
 told jurors he feared for his life, perceiving 'this was a clear and 
present danger.'  Dunn, who has a concealed weapons permit, fired 10 
shots, hitting the vehicle nine times.

Prosecutors
 contended that Dunn opened fire because he felt disrespected by Davis. 
The teen made his friend turn the music back up after they initially 
turned it down at Dunn's request. Dunn was parked in the spot next to 
the SUV outside the convenience store.

'That
 defendant didn't shoot into a carful of kids to save his life. He shot 
into it to save his pride,' Assistant State Attorney John Guy told the 
jury earlier in the week. 'Jordan Davis didn't have a weapon, he had a 
big mouth.'

The trial was 
the latest Florida case to raise questions about self-defense and race, 
coming six months after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting 
of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, about 125 miles south of 
Jacksonville. 

The Dunn trial was prosecuted by the same State Attorney's
 Office that handled the Zimmerman case.

Dunn's
 attorney told reporters before the verdict that he 
believed there was political pressure on the prosecutors and an excess 
of media attention because of Zimmerman's acquittal.

'I

 believe there is a lot vested in this case, politically,' Strolla said.
 'The case, on the heels of not guilty in George Zimmerman, just 
escalated that political pressure.'

Prosecutors and defense attorneys wrapped up their cases Wednesday in a trial that has 
turned on a confrontation between the teens and Dunn over what he called their 'ridiculously, obnoxiously loud thug music.'

Dunn claimed the 
music, which he described as 'rap c**p', was so loud it hurt his ears 
and caused his car to vibrate.

Prosecutor Erin Wolfson told jurors 
that Dunn's 'blood started to boil' because of the vehicle-rattling 
'thug music' coming from the SUV.

Dunn
 escalated the confrontation and fired in premeditated fashion because a
 teenager had disrespected him, the prosecutor said. 

She
 said: 'This defendant was disrespected by a 17-year-old teenager, and 
he lost it. He wasn't happy with Jordan Davis' attitude. What was his 
response? ''You're not going to talk to me like that.'"

'He took these actions because it was premeditated. It was not self-defense.'

Dunn's
 attorney argued that his client used legitimate self-defense after 
Davis let forth with an expletive-laced threat and rebuffed the 
prosecution's claim that Dunn was 'a madman with a gun'.

Moment of grace: Lucie McBath told reporters that she pities Dunn because he will live out the rest of his life in torment and she promised to pray for him

The failure to reach a verdict on the first-degree murder charge is a blow for the prosecution and the Davis family. But the three guilty verdicts on the charge of attempted second degree murder against the other teens in the SUV, mean that Dunn still faces a sentence of at least 60 years in jail, legal analysts said.

Prosecutors told a press conference after the verdicts that they plan to retry Dunn on the murder charge.

‘It's been a long, long road and we're so very happy to have just a little bit of closure,’ Davis' mother, Lucy McBath, told reporters.

‘It's sad for Mr. Dunn that he will live the rest of his life in that sense of torment. I will pray for him. I will ask my family to pray for him,’ she said.

‘But we are so grateful for the charges that have been brought against him, we are so grateful for the truth, we are so grateful that the jurors were able to understand the common sense of it all.’

On Dunn's potentially lengthy sentence, Davis' father, Ron Davis, said: 'He's going to learn that he must be remorseful for the killing of my son, that it was not just another day at the office.'
