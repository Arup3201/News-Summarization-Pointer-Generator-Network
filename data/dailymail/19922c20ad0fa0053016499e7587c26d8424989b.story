Bali Nine convict Scott Rush will be questioned by authorities about photos that allegedly show him smoking crack cocaine behind bars in Kerobokan prison.

The prison's governor Farid Junaidi says he will study the photos published by News Corp on Monday and question Rush, who is serving life for the 2005 attempt to bring 8kg of heroin from Bali into Australia.

The report quotes an unnamed source who says despite the 28-year-old's claims to be clean, he regularly took meth, heroin and cocaine in the jail, which was 'like a supermarket' for drugs.

Mr Junaidi claimed to be leading a crackdown on contraband drugs, but admitted it was possible that some slipped through the cracks.

Photographs allegedly show Bali Nine drug trafficker Scott Rush using drugs in prison

The pictures allegedly show Rush holding and inhaling from drug paraphernalia and were taken in January

'Since the very beginning that I've been in charge here, I've started a war on drugs,' he said.

'Prisons have been bombarded by drug smuggling and it's in big quantities, but we have managed to crack down on most of it.

'Certainly it's possible that some still get away with it.'

The photos were allegedly taken in January, under the governor's watch.

Rush - whose death sentence was commuted to a life sentence in 2011 - moved to Karangasem jail, in Bali's east, in February.

He had been requesting the move for a long time, in order to be closer to a local 'foster family' who were looking out for him.

An unnamed source told the Herald Sun that the 28-year-old was smoking crack cocaine, and added he would often take drugs during late-night parties.

'He has been telling people he has been clean of drugs for ages and that just isn't true,' the source said.

In June, Rush proposed to his successful London banker girlfriend who said she would only marry him if he turns his life around and is not doing any drugs.

During a prison visit Rush dropped to one knee and asked 38-year-old mother-of-two Nikki Butler to marry him, more than nine years after they met for just a few hours before he was stopped with 1.3kg of heroin strapped to his body.

Ms Butler had lost touch with the 28-year-old drug smuggler during his years of incarceration, but reunited with him in April after she recognised an image of him on British TV which referenced the Bali Nine.

Earlier this year he became the second of the Bali nine drug couriers to be moved out of Kerobokan Prison, moving to Karangasem in Bali's far east.

'Rush was moved in February this year because he was getting beaten up and getting some serious threats over a drug debt of about $5000,' the source told the Herald Sun.

Kerobokan prison is awash with drugs, particularly crystal methamphetamine and heroin, with the trade controlled by local gangs.

At just 19 years of age Rush was committed to stand trial and sentenced to life in prison after hisÂ  arrest at a Denpasar airport with 1.8 kg of heroin concealed on his body.

After an appeal he was given the death penalty - which was later overturned back to a life in 2011. The couple hope that sentence will be reduced to between 15 and 20 years.

Earlier this year, pictures of another Bali Nine inmate, Renae Lawrence, 37, were also investigated.

In the video footage, Lawrence claimed her former cell mate, Schapelle Corby, knowingly smuggled marijuana into Indonesia.

Bali officials determined the video couldn't be used as evidence against Corby, who is now out on parole.
