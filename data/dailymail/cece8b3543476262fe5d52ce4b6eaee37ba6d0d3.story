Britain's FBI has launched its cybercrime 'strike week', arresting 57 suspected hackers in a series of 25 raids including a member of the notorious Lizard Squad.

The 16-year-old from Leeds was held by the National Crime Agency (NCA) on suspicion of targeting approximately 350 websites.

It is claimed he may be a member of the Lizard Squad hackers who say they brought down the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox Live networks as well as Facebook and Instagram.

The 16-year-old from Leeds was held by the National Crime Agency (NCA) on suspicion of targeting approximately 350 websites, and may be a member of the notorious Lizard Squad gang

The NCA also arrested 56 others for cybercrimes including stealing data, fraud and virus development across the UK.

One suspect was held in connection with an alleged cyber attack on the United States Department of Defence (DoD) - and may have been a bitter Lizard Squad rival.  

The 23-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday  on suspicion of offences linked to data stolen from a messaging service used by DoD employees around the world.

Contact information for around 800 people including name, title, e-mail addresses and phone numbers, as well as details for around 34,400 devices were obtained during the attack last June, the NCA said.

Following the attack, the hacker posted screenshots taken from the dashboard used to control the database as well as a bizarre message on the text storage website Pastebin.

It read: 'We smite the Lizards, LizardSquad your time is near. We're in your bases, we control your satellites.

'The missiles shall rein upon thy who claim alliance, watch your heads, ** T-47:59:59 until lift off. We're one, we're many, we lurk in the dark, we're everywhere and anywhere.

'Live Free Die Hard! DoD, DISA EMSS : Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services is not all, Department of Defense has no Defenses.'

Campaign: NCA officers force their way in to another property during a string of raids they are calling 'strike week'

Message: The NCA, considered Britain's FBI, has been working with counterparts from the Department of Defense in the United states

Lizard Squad's Facebook page after claiming it hacked Sony Playstation and Xbox

The Lizard Squad took credit for bringing down the Microsoft's Xbox, and Sony's PlayStation online networks, hitting users on Christmas Day. 

The hacking group said it wanted to expose the two firms' poor security.

The consoles rely on an internet connection for many functions.

One of the most popular features of the consoles, for example, is the ability to play against friends and other users. 

While an internet connection is not required to play all games, new Xbox One consoles need to be online to be successfully set-up.

Many of those who received the consoles as Christmas presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started. 

Furthermore, games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully, which was ruled out by the hack.

A message on the Xbox status page at the weekend said its core services were 'up and running'. 

Sony engineers then confirmed its core services were also back online, but heavy traffic might continue to cause problems, as thousands of users log back on.

The stolen data was used as part of an international satellite message dissemination system known as Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services.

It also included IMEI numbers, which are the unique codes used to identify a mobile device.

No sensitive data was obtained and none of the data obtained could be used to personally identify anyone or threaten US national security, the NCA added.

More than 40 arrests have been made this week by the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit at more than 20 separate locations across England, Wales and Scotland as part of a week of activity targeting cyber crime.

Another man was held on suspicion of involvement in a 2012 hack on Yahoo. 

Andy Archibald, deputy director of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said: 'Behind this week's activity is the message that all of us, as individuals, businesses or law enforcement agencies, have a role to play in making the UK a safe place to enjoy the huge opportunities provided by the internet.

'Awareness of the type of cyber crime dangers which are out there is vital, whoever you are, as is collaboration between organisations across different sectors, regions and countries to develop the most effective ways of combating those threats.

'We will continue to work with partners to pursue and disrupt the major crime groups targeting the UK, but also, crucially, to make the UK as difficult as possible a target for cyber criminals in the first place.'

Jeffrey Thorpe, special agent in charge, at the US Department of Defence criminal investigative service (DCIS), said: 'This arrest underscores DCIS commitment and the joint ongoing efforts among international law enforcement to stop cyber criminals in their tracks. DCIS special agents will use every tool at their disposal to pursue and bring to justice those that attack the Department of Defence.'

Lizard Squad is a network of hackers which bears striking similarities to the online anarchist collective Anonymous and is described as 'vocal, taunting and bit obnoxious'.

The group seeks to cause mayhem online 'for a laugh' and has called itself the 'next generation Grinch' after the children's character that hates Christmas, often using Twitter to boast of upcoming attacks.

Some reports say it mainly operates from Russia but others believe it is more likely to be made up of underground networks of hackers from around the world, communicating using the 'dark web'. 

Lizard Squad has a history of targeting computer game companies, particularly Sony. 

In August it sent a bomb threat to Sony chief executive John Smedley, the same month in which it attacked Playstation just to cause 'havoc'. 

Dan Holden, of online security company Arbor Networks, said: 'If they're coming after you, you're going to have a bad day.'
