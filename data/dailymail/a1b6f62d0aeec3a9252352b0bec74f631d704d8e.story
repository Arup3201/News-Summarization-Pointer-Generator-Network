When Alvin Tjosaas was a teenager, he helped his father build a vacation home in the California desert.

More than 50 years later, he has been 'left to sit among the ruins of the house' after it was mistakenly ransacked by a bank twice.

Wells Fargo had a warrant to foreclose on the property - but they went to the wrong home.

Foreclosed: Wells Fargo wrongly sent contractors to take possessions from this house in the California desert

Trash: Workers left the house in a poor state and dumped family possessions in the yard

Back in 1961, Tjosaas built the two-bedroom house in Twentynine Palms when he was just 14-years-old.

'I put my whole life into this place, building it for my mom and dad,' Tjosaas told ABC.

Now 77, the retired mason has spent much of his life in the home, and enjoyed vacations there with his wife Pat and their six children.

But twice this summer subcontractors have visited the house in an attempt to foreclose, claiming the owner had defaulted on his mortgage with banking giant Wells Fargo.

The Tjosaases have never had a mortgage on the home they have owned for over half a century.

The subcontractors barged into the property with a foreclosure notice in hand. The notice had the address for the Tjosaas home but had the name Stephen A. Janoski on it, reported ABC.

Pride: The retired mason always lavished attention on the rural getaway

After the break-in, police told Mr Tjosaas: 'Good news, we know who took it - Wells Fargo. Bad news, your stuff's all gone.'

In June, the aggressive contractors apparently took three lawnmowers, three golf carts and family mementos including Mr Tjosaas' father's uniform from World War I.

As well as stealing all of the family's valuables, the bank broke down doors, smashed windows and tore down walls.

Patricia Tjosaas said that when she and her husband managed to reach the house, they called police who took the workers to the home they were supposed to be at, 10 acres away.

'Alvin was left to sit among the ruins of the house,' she told ABC News.

But the contractors returned over Labor Day and dumped many of the family's possessions in the front yard.

Devastation: The homeowner saw much of his life's work turn to dust when his house was ransacked

It also appeared that people had been 
living there after the workers broke in - someone had left beer and 
bongs lying around the house.

Mr Tjosaas spoke of his devastation at seeing his beloved home torn apart because of a stupid error.

'I know every inch, every rock,' he told CBS Los Angeles. 'My mom mixed all the cement by hand.'

He also reminisced about trips to the area as an adult: 'My little kids [would] come out here and their dresses were the same colour as the wildflowers.'

The family tried to contact Wells Fargo, but apparently received no reply from the bank until their story started attracting media coverage.

Notice: But the bank twice accidentally sent contractors to the wrong address

A spokesman for the bank said: 'We are deeply sorry for the very personal losses the Tjosaas family suffered as a result of their home being mistakenly secured and entered by an outside party hired to address a different nearby property.

'We are moving quickly to reach out to the Tjosaas family to resolve this unfortunate situation in an attempt to right this wrong.'

Wells Fargo has apparently offered the couple more than $250,000 in compensation for their loss.

Mr and Mrs Tjosaas and their lawyer met with the bank on Thursday but did not decide whether to accept Wells Fargo's offer.

Mr Tjosaas told CBS that he had held on to one consolation throughout the foreclosure ordeal - the love of his wife.

'I'm just glad I have my sweetheart,' he said. 'We've been together a long time.'
