Public sector workers will not get an above-inflation pay rise for another four years, it emerged today as unions prepare a huge strike over pay and pensions.

Conservative minister Matthew Hancock suggested pay restraint would have to continue until the government has ‘the books balanced’ in 2018.

Up to 1million teachers, council workers, health workers, firefighters and civil servants will walkout across England and Wales on Thursday.

This week’s industrial action is expected to be the biggest over pay since the coalition came to power, with plans for further action later in the year.

Unions argue that frontline staff have paid the price for austerity, and salaries have been frozen or risen slower than inflation.

Despite years of pay restraint, staff in the public sector still April earned between 2.2 per cent and 3.1 per cent more than the private sector in the year to April 2013, the ONS says.

The average pay difference in favour of the public sector has narrowed since the year 2010, which in part reflects the restraints on public sector pay over this period, the ONS says.

CPI inflation dipped to 1.5 per cent in the year to May, having peaked at 5.2 per cent in September 2011.

Mr Hancock, a skills minister, told BBC On'es Sunday politics inflation would continue to outstrip wages for taxpayer-funded jobs for another four years.

Asked if public sector workers would ever get a real increase in their pay under a Conservative government, Mr Hancock replied: ‘Well, we certainly hope to have the books balanced by 2018.

He added: ‘I don’t think it is the right time to let go of the public finances at all.

‘We were always clear that this is what’s called a structural deficit; it doesn’t go away just because growth is returning and the economy’s coming back.

‘We have protected and are protecting the lowest-paid public sector workers who weren’t part of the pay freeze, now pay going up by 1 per cent.

At almost every age, public sector workers earn more per hour than someone of the same age in the private sector, according to the Office for National Statistics 

Unions have been branded 'irresponsible' for staging walkouts based on ballots in which few members took part, or were staged up to two years ago. 

Prime Minister David Cameron pledged earlier this year that he would back tougher laws, including a higher threshold of those voting to take industrial action before a strike could go ahead. 

Business leaders have been pressing for a new law setting a target of at least 50 per cent of those balloted having to vote in favour, an idea supported by the PM and other leading Conservatives.

London Mayor Boris Johnson has spoken of changes in balloting laws during previous strikes by Tube workers in the capital.

Today Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said: 'We are not relaxed about them [the strikes], but the point to make first is most public sector workers regard their duty to serve the public as being paramount, so most public service workers won't be going on strike on Thursday. It will be a minority and we don't know how many it will be.

'These strikes are based on ballots which are either with extremely low turnouts or, in some cases, with no recent ballot at all,' he told Sky News.

'The only teachers' union calling a strike, the NUT, is relying on a mandate in a ballot that was called nearly two years ago.

'Taking action, which if it is effective is going to damage the interests of children and a load of hard-working parents who just want to be able to go to work that day... it is really very irresponsible.'

‘Of course these are difficult decisions – we’ve had that discussion many times – but they’re absolutely necessary to in order to keep that plan on track and, as we can see with the wider economy, it’s working.’

Mr Hancock insisted this was not just about the Conservatives and the Lib Dems and challenged Labour to condemn this week’s strike.

‘The Labour Party leadership has said it’s a test to their credibility that they support a squeeze on public sector pay.

‘In fact I look forward to them – they ought to come out and say very clearly that these strikes are wrong and that they’re against the strikes and stop taking union money.’

But earlier Labour’s shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt refused to condemn the walkouts three times.

He told BBC One’s Andrew Marr show: ‘It’s not up to me to tell trade unionists what to do – what I want is teachers in classrooms in a conversation with the Secretary of State so we get over these kind of hurdles.

‘We didn’t have these kind of strikes under a Labour government. I want all teachers in the schools teaching the young people, but we have independent trade unions in this country and that is an important part of civil society.’

TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady also criticised the Government for refusing to increase pay for the public sector.

She said: ‘What firefighters, local government workers and health worker who are protesting too alongside teachers are saying is that this Government is not listening, it’s out of touch, people can’t keep going on having cuts in their living standards, depending on benefits.

‘What really sticks in the throat is the idea that money can be found to give tax cuts to billionaires, to millionaires and to big corporations, but it can’t be found to help, for example, the 500,000 workers in local government – dinner ladies, school meals workers, lollipop men and women – who are earning less than the minimum wage.’ 

Mick Cash, acting general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: 'Reports that the Tories are planning to ban public sector strikes and ratchet up their anti-union laws are nothing new and will meet the fiercest possible resistance.

'The front line of defence against cuts and austerity is the organised working class and that is why the Tories and big business want to tighten the legal noose around our necks. They will have a fight on their hands.'
