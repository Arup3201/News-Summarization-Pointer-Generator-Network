An obese woman who was convinced her crippling stomach pains were the result of overeating lost 5st - only to discover she had cancer.

Alexis Boo, 38, reached 17.5st due to a diet of crisps, chocolate and takeaways.

But after shedding the weight through a meal replacement plan, she found herself still suffering frequent stomach pains.

Alexis Boo was 17st and suffered from stomach ache - she thought due to overeating. After losing 5st (right) she was still in pain - and tests revealed she had kidney cancer

In November 2012 the mother-of-two, from Bushey, Hertfordshire, went to her GP and was immediately referred for a scan. This showed she had stage one kidney cancer. 

Surgeons at the Churchill Hospital in Harrow removed her left kidney and, to her relief, she is now in remission.

Ms Boo, who is now a size 12, believes had she not lost the weight, she may never have been diagnosed with cancer.

She said: 'When you’re big you worry about clothes and looking bad, but you don’t always consider the impacts.

'Being
 that big you also don’t listen to your body. You’re not in tune - 
you’ll eat when you’re full and you don’t stop when you feel sick.

'Therefore
 if you have pains you put it down to having a bit too much food and you
 get used to the stomach aches - so when I had cancer I had no idea at 
all.'

Stomach pain can be a sign of kidney cancer, but usually in the later stages.

In a bid to shift the weight, Ms Boo switched to eating off side plates and ditched processed food.

But when the stomach pain continued, she went to see her GP.

She said: 'Had I not done that, I don’t know if I would be here now.

'I would still be walking around with the tumour which would have got bigger or spread and could have been life threatening.'

'After having the tumour removed I made a pledge that I wasn’t going to just maintain my weight but I wanted to get fit too.'

Two years on, Ms Boo now runs her own weight loss company, called Ideal Weight, and has gone on to lose a further 1.5st. 

Kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in adults in the UK, with 9,300 people diagnosed each year.

If found in stage one there is a 90 per cent chance of survival. But if left and discovered in stage four there is just a 10 per cent chance of living for another five years.

The disease is more likely to affect people who are overweight and smoke.
