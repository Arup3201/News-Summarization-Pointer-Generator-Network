A YOUNG woman plunged 20ft to her death through a warehouse roof in what is believed to have been a ‘drunken prank gone wrong’.

Yesterday tributes including a University of Bath cheerleading vest were left to the 22-year-old who was found dead close to a popular student pub.

Emergency services were called at around 4am on Saturday to the Travis Perkins builders’ merchant warehouse in Bath, Somerset, but were unable to save her.

A police helicopter was involved in the investigation but it is not thought she had been fleeing officers at the time.

Her death is being treated as a tragic accident and relatives have been informed.

As police investigated how she had come to be on the roof, grieving friends left the sports top nearby along with floral tributes.

The warehouse is located on Lower Bristol Road next to the River Avon and not far from popular student pub The Green Park Tavern.

A local resident, Terry Norris, 46, said the death could have been the result of a drunken prank.

He said: ‘Lots of students drink at The Green Park Tavern, so perhaps the girl was making her way back into town when the accident happened.'

Ambulance and fire crews responded to the emergency call after the 22-year-old - who hasn’t been named - was found on the concrete floor.

Tragically, however, the injuries she suffered in the fall were too severe.

The yard is normally open on Saturday mornings, but following the woman’s death a sign informed customers that it was closed due to unforeseen circumstances.

Yesterday the Travis Perkins yard was closed and secured by barbed wire with no warning signs visible.

A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said: ‘A 22-year-old female was found having fallen around 20ft onto a concrete floor through a roof.

‘Attempts were made to resuscitate her but they were unsuccessful and she sadly died at the scene.

‘We are not treating the death as suspicious and the next of kin have been informed.’
