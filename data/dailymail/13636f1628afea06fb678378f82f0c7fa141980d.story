These unusual structures - with their intricate designs and symmetrical forms - may look like they have been created by a 3D printer, but they are in fact more than a century old.

Displayed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), they are the artistic equivalent of a mathematical equation.

According to the team that collected the designs, the structures reveal how mathematics can describe the world around us, even in its most complex forms.

The Clebsch Diagonal Surface is one of the most famous surfaces in mathematics.  It was described by Alfred Clebsch in 1871.

It is remarkable as it has exactly 27 straight lines that lie flush to its surface.

The surface has three branches that join in a central column and in a flaring base. The 27 lines, etched in black, extend toward infinity.

There are exactly 10 points on the structure’s surface where three of the 27 lines meet.

These points are called Eckardt points, and the Clebsch diagonal surface is the only cubic surface to contain them.

Joshua Batson in Wired reports that the structures were created by Göttingen-based mathematician Felix Klein and displayed in Chicago in 1893.

MIT, the University of Arizona, Harvard, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ordered a large collection of his models which are now on display.

‘Digitally controlled 3D printers now produce such mathematical objects in exactly the same way as people did a century ago,’ Professor George Francis from the University of Illinois told MailOnline.

‘Both compute the data points from formulas, and build up the models, layer by layer like a wedding cake - but with thinner layers.’

The Clebsch diagonal is described by Mr Batson in Wired as one of the most beautiful models in the catalogue.

The symmetrical cubic equation was described by Alfred Clebsch in 1871 and is remarkable as it has exactly 27 straight lines that lie flush to its surface.

The surface has three branches that join in a central column and in a flaring base. The 27 lines, etched in black, extend toward infinity.

There are exactly 10 points on the structure’s surface where three of the 27 lines meet.

‘Making them is perhaps the most abstract art of all, in that they express in a real, touchy-feely way, ideas that initially exist purely in the mathematical mind,' said Professor Francis

These points are called Eckardt points, and the Clebsch diagonal surface is the only cubic surface to contain them.

The maths models were discovered by Georgetown-based Kalev Leetaru while researchers were cleaning the models during a move of their cases many years ago.

To build the model, workers in Klein’s laboratory drew the horizontal sections solving a planar version of the equation.

Each cross-section was cast separately, in a plaster made from powdered chalk. The layers were then stacked, glued together, and sanded until they were smooth.
