Lazing about in the African sun, these lions have no idea their actions are being caught on BeetelCam.

Because the remote-controlled camouflaged cameras is allowing Will Burrard-Lucas to capture intimate snaps of some of the continents most fearsome animals, without the risk of being savaged.

The 29-year-old, from London, stands about 55 yards away before using a model aeroplane remote to deploy the homemade roving machines into the paths of lions, elephants and buffalo roaming on the plains of the South Luangwa National Park, in Zambia.

Captured: A female lion is intrigued by the camera as it crawls along the savannah floor

Up close: A female lion seems quite happy with BeetleCam taking her picture from within touching distance

Camouflaged: Will Burrard-Lucas has moved to Zambia from his home in London to grab the pictures using his ingenious cameras

Family life: Mr Burrard-Lucas has been able to capture impressive images of a range of animals including this baby elephant with one of its parents

Will, who has moved to the country for a year with his doctor wife Natalie, said: 'It is the dry season so a lot of the animals have to come to the river to drink.

'It means there's an high concentration of wildlife around the water, it is a real hive of activity.

'Because I'm living in Africa now I can spend more time working on getting close to shier creatures who otherwise would never come near the camera.

'It has enabled me to capture a leopard with the BeetleCam for the first time." Will took the photos in South Luangwa National Park.

He added: 'Most of the animals are very inquisitive, they will come and check the camera out but others are more wary, so photographing them takes a lot more patience.

'Three years ago I didn't have any armour on the camera and a curious lioness completely destroyed it.

Unaware: A lone elephant wanders through foliage on the savannah in Zambia without realising it has company

Intrigued: A female lion makes her way to the camera after spotting it from further away

Teamwork: The lioness is joined by another as they investigate the camera making its way across the floor of the African plain

Personal: BeetleCam captures an intimate moment as one of the female lion lets out a yawn

'So now on the fourth-generation of the buggy I've reinforced the camera so it stands up to attention of most animals.'

While Will is taking candid photographs of wild animals, Natalie is working in a rural Zambian hospital and is writing a blog about her experiences.

Spotted: A leopard approaches BeetleCam with a curious look in its eye

Alert: The camera captures the leopard looking into the distance as it keeps its eye open for other dangers

Relaxed: BeetleCam has been able to capture its first pictures of leopards since Mr Burrard-Smith relocated

Danger: BeetleCam risks being trampled as it grabs a picture of a herd of buffalo
