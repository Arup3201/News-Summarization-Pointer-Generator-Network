Manchester United's attacking woes have been highlighted once more as it has emerged that Tottenham striker Harry Kane has scored more goals than Louis van Gaal's entire attack this season. 

Kane has scored 26 goals in all competitions during the course of the current campaign. The Tottenham star has netted 16 Barclays Premier League goals thus far.

Manchester United's attacking trio of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao have amassed 25 goals in all competitions during the same period.

Kane's form has been the highlight of Tottenham's season so far

Harry Kane: 26 

Robin van Persie: 10 

Wayne Rooney: 11 

Radamel Falcao: 4  

That statistic will compound a miserable week for United who were dumped out of the FA Cup by Arsenal on Monday night. 

Rooney, who has been deployed in a midfield role in recent months, put his recent goal-scoring issues behind him to fire United into the lead in the 29th minute. 

But former United striker Danny Welbeck came back to haunt his old employers with the winner on the hour mark. 

Welbeck was moved on by Van Gaal following Falcao's arrival but the Colombian has not been having the best of times at Old Trafford recently.

Falcao left Manchester United's Carrington training base on Thursday, well aware that his chances to impress at his loan club have run out.

The Colombian striker suffered an embarrassing demotion to United's Under 21 side this week and sources close to Falcao say he recognises that he made the wrong move when picking Old Trafford in the summer. 

Spurs, meanwhile, are having no such issues up front as Kane's superb form has earned him the Barclays Premier League player of the month award for the second successive time.

The Tottenham striker scored four goals in February, including a brace against north London rivals Arsenal and the equaliser against West Ham.

He is also likely to earn his first senior England call-up later this month when Roy Hodgson names his squad to face Lithuania and Italy.
