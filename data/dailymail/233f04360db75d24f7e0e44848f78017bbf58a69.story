Laura Mitchell, 25, stormed into a cafe in Ossett, West Yorkshire, and hurled racist abuse at Martha Kolleh-McBurrough, a court heard

A cafe owner who posted signs in her window ‘warning’ customers she was black was later called a 'black b****' by an angry woman who stormed into her restaurant, a court heard.

Martha Kolleh-McBurrough caused controversy last summer when she put up the notice in her Yeanon cafe in Ossett, West Yorkshire, saying it was to ward off racist customers.

Three months later, however, a woman rushed into her cafe, accusing Ms Kolleh-McBurrough of damaging her parked car and hurling racist abuse at her.

Wakefield Magistrates' Court heard that care worker Laura Mitchell, 25, was told by a neighbour that they'd seen Ms Kolleh-McBurrough bump her car, which was parked outside the cafe.

Mitchell, who was seven months pregnant at the time and holding her three year-old daughter, called her ‘every name in the book, including black ‘b***’, the court heard.

Magistrates were also told that Mitchell, from Ossett, threatened to slap the cafe owner.

Ms Kolleh-McBurrough said: 'She was calling me all the names in the book. She was really, really angry.'

Mitchell wept yesterday as she was convicted of making racially aggravated threats.

She said she had only gone into the cafe to exchange insurance details with Ms Kolleh-McBurrough, whom she said told her 'You’re accusing me because of the colour of my skin'.

Mitchell claimed that the owner stood there: 'Right in my face, yelling and waving a spatula about in a threatening manner.

'She seemed very irate'.

Andrew Morris, who was eating in the cafe at the time, said Mitchell was aggressive and bigoted behaviour and he eventually told her: 'There’s no need for racism'.

Prosecutor Martin Sleight said: 'The complainant came across as an honest and truthful witness who hadn’t come to court to make a malicious allegation against the defendant.'

Referring to the cafe owner’s controversial sign, he added: 'She felt that people were racist towards her. I do not believe that people of Ossett are generally racist.'

Ben Tighe, for Mitchell, said she was of previous good character but added: 'Racism cannot and must not be tolerated in our society.'

Mitchell was fined £485 and ordered to pay a £300 victim surcharge.
