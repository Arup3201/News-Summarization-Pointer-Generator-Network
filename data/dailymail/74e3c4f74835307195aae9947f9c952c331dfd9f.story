Ed Miliband’s plan to encourage businesses to pay a ‘living wage’ would put 300,000 young people out of work, a former aide to Tony Blair warned yesterday.

The Labour leader will today announce that he would offer tax breaks to firms who pay their employees £8.80 an hour in London and £7.65 in the rest of the UK – far higher than the minimum wage, which is £6.31 an hour.

But John McTernan, who helped Mr Blair introduce the minimum wage in 1999, warned yesterday that the policy would be a disaster for jobs and hit young people particularly hard.

Political adviser John McTernan who helped Tony Blair roll out the minimum wage in 1999 has warned new living wage estimates will be dangerous to jobs

‘The national minimum wage was subject to intense economic scrutiny to make sure you set the level at a level which would not destroy jobs,’ he said. ‘The London Living Wage is £8.80 an hour, which is a 40 per cent increase or more on the minimum wage.

‘I don’t think you can increase wages that much without destroying jobs.

‘A study says that if you implement it across the country it would lead to 300,000 young people losing their jobs and I don’t think we can afford that at a time of high unemployment.

‘Many decent people support this campaign. But they are wrong.’

The Labour leader is expected to suggest people are 'working for poverty' in a speech today

Mr Miliband will use his speech today to say that there is a ‘low-pay emergency’ in Britain, with people ‘working for their poverty’.

‘More than five million people are now paid less than the living wage – up 1.4 million in just the last four years to one in five of all employed workers,’ he will say.

‘And low wages aren’t just bad for working people, they cost money in benefits too as the country has to subsidise more and more low-paid jobs with higher and higher tax credits and benefits.

‘Many businesses now recognise that a low-pay economy is bad for them, too. Better pay means lower turnover of staff, higher productivity.’

Attempting to make the cost of living the major battle line before the general election, Mr Miliband will again press his calls for state controls on energy prices.

Labour figures – audited by the House of Commons Library, – show how the wholesale cost of energy has risen at an average rate of 1.6 per cent a year since 2011, while the Big Six energy firms have increased retail prices by an average of 10.4 per cent a year.

Labour will force a vote in the Commons tomorrow on Mr Miliband’s plan for an energy price freeze for 20 months after the next election.

The Labour leader challenged the Tories and Lib Dems to back the plan.
