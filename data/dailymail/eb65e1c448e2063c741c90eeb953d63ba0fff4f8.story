An Air Canada plane made an abrupt landing and left the runway at the Halifax airport in bad weather, but there were no immediate reports of injuries, authorities said early Sunday.

The airline said all passengers with Flight AC624 from Toronto left the plane and went to the terminal. 

Halifax Airport said there were no injuries reported.

The airline said a preliminary count indicated 132 passengers and five crew members. 

Flight tracking service FlightAware showed that the plane is an AirbusA320, which has typical seating for 150.

Power at the airport was briefly knocked out, but Nova Scotia Power said they had since restored it. The cause of the outage was not yet clear.

The Halifax region is currently under a snowfall warning, with an Environment Canada alert saying, 'Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.'

Another flight tracking site, Flightradar24, listed several cancelled flights at the airport Sunday morning.
