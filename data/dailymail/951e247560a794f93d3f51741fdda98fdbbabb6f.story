Exactly a year from Thursday, England will line up against Fiji in the opening encounter of a home World Cup which has the potential to profoundly galvanise the sport. 

The national team are steadily on the rise as a global force, but the All Blacks remain the benchmark for all other countries as they prepare to defend their title, and the balance of power is still in the south, with the European teams continuing their perennial quest to close the gap.

Stuart Lancaster will have the pressurised honour of orchestrating the hosts’ challenge and he senses that the primary factor will be the drive and focus among his players, in front of their own people. ‘To win the top games you need a whole variety of different qualities – technical, physical, mental – but ultimately you need motivation,’ he told England Rugby TV. ‘You need to think, “What’s the reason I am going to play for this team? Why is playing for this team special?”.

‘You need to pull that together and create an extra 10 or 15 per cent in a player that can take him to a place where he’ll put his body on the line but also work harder than he has ever worked before. That motivation is not a little part of the jigsaw – it’s a big, big part of the jigsaw. It’s the difference sometimes between winning and losing.’

It's 365 days until the World Cup kicks off

Lancaster is convinced that the English public will inspire his team and that they in turn can inspire the country, adding: ‘The support people have for sporting events in this country now is better than anyone’s in the world.

‘I think the fans feel they are supporting a team that is young and ambitious, that wants to have a go and I think the players respond likewise and it becomes a virtuous circle. The players love playing at Twickenham, the fans hopefully love watching the team play and I think that is hugely important.

‘We have worked hard on talking about the identity of being English. You have to have character to be an England player; a strong sense of purpose, never take a backwards step, always delivering under pressure, a level of commitment that is probably above and beyond what most people would expect and a resilience that means we are a very difficult team to beat. Alongside all that, you need those world- class players.’

With 12 months to go until the World Cup begins, here is how the leading eight nations are shaping up for the tournament…

England

IRB ranking: 4

Key man: Manu Tuilagi - midfield game-changer

There has been notable progress under Lancaster, but the crucial requirement this season is to fine-tune the primary starting XV and establish tangible momentum. 

Up front, the pack possess ominous strength in most areas, although Graham Rowntree would still welcome another pedigree tighthead prop. The set piece is largely reliable, but the breakdown work can be hit and miss – captain Chris Robshaw is under pressure on that basis.

Behind the scrum, there are many half-back options, but midfield and the back three are areas to resolve. Prolific, consistent, reliable wings are in short supply and No 12 remains a conundrum. 

England wish to play a more expansive game, but they cannot do so until they are settled and confident. Lancaster needs three wins in the autumn and, ideally, a Six Nations title to generate serious momentum, but his team will be combative and fear no-one at home.

FRANCE

IRB ranking: 7

Key man: Thomas Domingo – master scrummager.

A total shambles. Philippe Saint-Andre bemoans the abundance of foreigners in the Top 14 league.

But the head coach still has sufficient players of Test quality to call upon, such as the magnificent Thierry Dusautoir in the back row and a pair of sensational centres – Wesley Fofana and Gael Fickou. 

‘Les Bleus’ have been abject in the Six Nations in recent years and they were a rabble in surrendering 3-0 to the Wallabies Down Under in June, but – as ever – there is no knowing when they may suddenly ignite. History suggests they can emerge from their dire state to be a threat.

IRELAND

IRB ranking: 5

Key man: Jonathan Sexton – attacking ring-master.

Joe Schmidt has been in charge for one season and his team marked it with a Six Nations triumph, to give the great Brian O’Driscoll a fitting send-off. 

Life after the iconic centre will be difficult – it is not just a matter of replacing the player but also filling the inspiration void. 

Yet, Ireland’s first assignment without ‘BOD’ led to a 2-0 win in Argentina, which is no mean feat. 

They must hope that their other veteran talisman has enough left in him to be a force at the World Cup. There are Lions in all areas, an improved scrum and ball-carrying clout, and Schmidt provides astute tactical nous.

SCOTLAND 

IRB ranking: 8

Key man: Stuart Hogg – rare ‘X-factor’ back.

Kiwi coach Vern Cotter has a huge task on his hands to make the Scots competitive at next year’s tournament. In the last Six Nations, they scored just 47 points in their five games – highlighting a chronic lack of attacking menace. 

Their 20-0 home defeat against England was the shocking nadir, but Cotter led his side to summer wins over the USA, Canada and Argentina, before a weakened team were routed by the Springboks. 

Not enough depth, especially in the backs, but positive results for Edinburgh and Glasgow may provide renewed belief. Samoa are a threat to their qualification from Pool B.

WALES 

IRB ranking: 6

Key man: Sam Warburton – groundhog captain.

How they need a major southern-hemisphere scalp this autumn. Warren Gatland has turned his team into regular masters of this continent, but against the SANZAR giants they are in a prolonged losing rut. 

The Welsh issue is a lack of belief – they had South Africa by the throats in Nelspruit in June, but conspired to lose the Test. 

Doubts remain over best choice at 10 and Gatland can’t afford many injuries due to lack of elite cover in some areas. 

Veteran props may be in decline, but overall their best XV has ample bulk, pace, power and experience for tough Pool A battles.

Wales' fearless leader Sam Warburton is dynamic at the breakdown but they need a scalp from the south

AUSTRALIA 

IRB ranking: 3

Key man: Israel Folau – main running threat.

Mixed signals are emerging about the strength of the Wallabies revival under Ewen McKenzie. 

They managed to prevent a Kiwi world record for consecutive Test wins by drawing with the world champions in Sydney, only to promptly ship a half-century of points in Auckland a week later. 

Then they beat the Springboks but laboured to dispatch Argentina. 

Folau is a lethal presence out wide, but their controversial stars are either peripheral – in the case of Quade Cooper and Kurtley Beale – or overseas – in the case of James O’Connor. 

Up front, they continue to lack set-piece clout and mighty flanker David Pocock is missed.

Israel Folau is a destructive runner but inconsistency is becoming the hallmark of Ewen McKenzie's Wallabies

NEW ZEALAND

IRB ranking: 1

Key man: Kieran Read - world’s best player.

Steve Hansen’s All Blacks are imperious. Their dominance of the world game goes on unchecked. 

England gave them a fright in June, without managing to end their long spell of home rule which now extends to 36 Tests. They have lost just once since the last World Cup and continue to thwart the chasing pack. 

Despite doubts about veterans such as captain Richie McCaw, Dan Carter and Tony Woodcock, new sensations keep emerging. Julian Savea is the try-scoring phenomenon who provides the finishing class to capitalise on clinical counter-attacking and unsurpassed skill levels. 

New Zealand have a gear no other side possesses.

SOUTH AFRICA 

IRB ranking: 2

Key man: Eben Etzebeth – rookie enforcer.

Seemingly the best equipped of the challengers to All Blacks supremacy, as they are armed with deep reserves of powerful players who believe they are the pre-eminent rugby nation. 

They have lowered the New Zealand flag at junior level of late and must hope the habit pervades the senior ranks soon.

On their day, the Springboks generate forward fury which no country can handle – as England found out in Johannesburg two years ago, while Willie le Roux is a gloriously unorthodox attacking presence. 

What they need now is conviction from coach Heyneke Meyer about the best strategic approach. Muddled thinking is hampering the Boks.
