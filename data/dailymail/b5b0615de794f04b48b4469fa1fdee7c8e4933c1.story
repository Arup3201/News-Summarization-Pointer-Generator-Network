A 21-year-old handler has been reunited with the tiger which nearly killed her.

Marissa Dub recently returned to the Exotic Feline Rescue Center in Center Point, Indiana, to meet Raja, less than two months since he bit down on her head.

The Terre Haute resident was left with severe back and ear lacerations, a shattered jaw, neck trauma and damaged vocal cords after Raja lunged at her while she cleaned his cage in June.

Dub had forgotten to drop the slide gate, enabling him to escape.

'It was her dream': Marissa Dub wanted to work with big cats since she was a child

WUSA9.com reported workers sprayed the 18-year-old tiger with a hose and tossed meat on the ground to distract him for six minutes until he could be moved back into a contained area.

'It was huge,' Clay County Sheriff's Department chief deputy, Rob Gambill, said. 'It looked very menacing to me. It was a very large animal.'

Dub, who had worked at the center since May 2012 since completing an internship, was flown to Wishard Memorial Hospital in a critical condition.

She now is undergoing daily treatment at Union Hospital's Medical Rehabilitation Unit.

Dub's mother Kris told News 10 said working with big cats had always been her daughter's dream.

She spoke on behalf of her young daughter because her vocal cords are still badly injured.

'It's been a dream of hers, a life-long dream. It's all she's ever wanted to do is work with big cats,' she said.

'She’s doing great. Everyday, she's stronger, better movement, better balance. She will be back there as soon as she can. They're welcoming her back at whatever capacity she needs to be at. So she will definitely be back.'

WISHTV.com reports Dub works a few hours a day at the feline center when she’s not in rehabilitation, but not directly with the animals.

Prior to starting her job at Exotic Feline Rescue Center in May 2012, she worked as a summer intern at Black Pine Animal Sanctuary in 2011.

Joe Taft, director of the center, told the Chicago Tribune at the time of the attack that Dub had studied animal science in college and impressed staff with her devotion to the animals.

'She was a bright and energetic young lady, she had a real passion to be working with these animals,' he said.

'Her college career was devoted to giving her a degree where she could work with animals.'

He said Raja was trained to go into a 
separate pen when his cage was cleaned, and this was an 'accident'.

The 22-year-old facility has about 230 cats, including 140 tigers, which have been confiscated by federal and state agencies from people who own the animals illegally.
