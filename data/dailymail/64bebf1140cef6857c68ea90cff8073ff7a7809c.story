Head injuries: Anthony Owen died a week after being found unconscious just 20 yards from his home

The family and friends of a gifted surgeon killed outside his home reacted furiously yesterday when a teenager charged over his death escaped prosecution.

Anthony Owen, 68, was found sprawled on the ground next to his car and died in hospital six days later from head injuries.

A 17-year-old boy was arrested, questioned by detectives and charged with manslaughter.

But yesterday the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case, saying a pathologist’s report supported the boy’s claim that he hit the cancer specialist in self defence.

Without any witnesses, lawyers said there was little prospect of a conviction.

Mr Owen’s sister, Aileen Hepplewhite, 53, said: ‘To say that dropping the prosecution is a step in the wrong direction is an understatement.

‘It’s hard to describe how I feel. Obviously as a family we are disappointed no one  will face trial but that hardly conveys the feelings we have about everything that  has happened.’

A neighbour said: ‘It’s terribly upsetting. I can’t begin  to imagine how difficult it must be for the family. It’s just typical of our justice system. It’s an absolute disgrace.’

Another resident added: ‘This teenager claimed self-defence and with no evidence or witnesses it seems there’s nothing the law can do.

‘It’s a terrible shame and awful for Anthony’s family that they will not see justice done.’

The incident took place in March in the prosperous Cheshire village of Hale. Afterwards three teenagers were seen riding away from Mr Owen’s £750,000 thatched house on BMX bikes.

Three suspects were arrested and questioned before one – the 17 year old – was charged with manslaughter.

A respected oncologist, Mr Owen began his medical career in 1968 and was awarded a fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1973.

He was semi-retired but had been working as a locum at Wrexham Maelor Hospital in North Wales up until his tragic death.

Well to do: Mr Owen's home in Hale Village, 
Widnes, Cheshire, where he lived alone.

The devout Roman Catholic, who had 
never married, had lived in Hale for more than 30 years, nursing his 
mother Anne, herself a retired doctor, until she died in 2003.

Laurie Northern, who attended church 
with Mr Owen, described him as ‘the type of man who would stand up for 
himself’.

And residents living in the village have complained that 
teenagers from a nearby housing estate cause frequent problems.

Rachael Barber, senior prosecutor at 
the CPS, said: ‘After very careful consideration of all the evidence in 
this case, including new evidence which has recently been presented, I 
have decided not to continue the case against a 17-year-old youth in 
connection with the death of Anthony Owen.

‘The youth was originally charged with
manslaughter on the basis that there was  a reasonable suspicion he had
committed the offence and there were grounds for  believing that the 
continuing investigation would provide further evidence to support the 
prosecution.

Mr Owen, a devout Catholic, had lived in the quiet village of Hale for more than 30 years and was well-liked by his neighbours

‘Since then, new evidence has been 
presented, including the final pathologist’s report which indicates that
the injuries to the victim were consistent with the victim suffering 
one blow to the face.

‘The pathologist’s report provides 
supporting evidence for the defendant’s version of events: that he was 
acting in self defence.

This expected further evidence has not provided 
us with a stronger case to meet the test of sufficient evidence for a 
realistic prospect of conviction.’

She said that without witnesses 
prosecutors would not be able in court to rebut the defendant’s claim 
that he was acting in self defence.

‘In addition, we took into account 
that he had come  forward voluntarily to give his account and that he 
has no previous convictions,’ she added.

Two other youths, aged 14 and 17, who were also at the scene, were earlier released without charge due to insufficient evidence.

Another neighbour said: ‘I sincerely 
hope the lad feels some remorse over the death of a wonderful man and a 
gifted surgeon who saved and extended so many lives.’

The mother of the teenage boy, whose 
identity is protected by law, said: ‘We have been advised by our 
solicitor not to make any comment until after the coroner has held an 
inquest.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
