A British artist has been killed and his partner is feared dead after a gas explosion ripped through the home they built together in Portugal.

Glyn Uzzell, 84, had lived with Paul Fonk in the villa in the Algarve region for 35 years, and two works by David Hockney were thought to be hanging in his home when it was destroyed.

Portuguese media reported tonight that Mr Uzzell's partner had been confirmed as a second victim in the tragic blast.

Wreckage: The home was completely destroyed along with a separate studio for Mr Uzzell's work

The vast explosion yesterday morning was heard more than a mile away and completely obliterated the house, leaving its roof on a neighbour's property.

Debris was thrown 300 metres away before police and rescue workers descended on the area, popular with British ex-pats, just before 8am local time.

Destroyed: A print of The Diploma by David Hockney (pictured) was believed to be in Mr Uzzell's home

Born in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 1930, Mr Uzzell studied at London's renowned Goldsmith’s College before moving in 1957 to teach at the International School of Geneva, Switzerland.

There he won prizes and was given a one-man exhibition at the city's Musée de l’Athenée.

It was there that he met his Luxembourg-born partner Mr Fonk and the pair moved to the Portuguese village of Caramujeira, near Lisbon, in 1979.

They painstakingly renovated a dilapidated farmhouse into a villa and decorated it with art, including two works by the renowned British artist David Hockney.

One of the works was believed to be a tongue-in-cheek etching of a fake diploma which Hockney made when the Royal College of Art refused to award him one after he spoiled an exam paper as a protest.

Friend Rolf Osang said Mr Uzzell picked up 
the artwork in a gallery in London's 
Sloane Square for a little over £5 soon after it was created in 1962.

Called The Diploma, it was produced in an edition of 50 and has been hailed as one of Hockney's great early works. Another copy of The Diploma sold at auction for £29,760 last year in London.

Mr Uzzell's print, which featured a goose-stepping art school head and a monster, is thought to have been destroyed in the blast.

Mr Osang, 64, who owns the Galeria Arte Algarve where Mr Uzzell exhibited much of his recent work, paid tribute to the artist.

'He's a very established artist and we
 were very lucky to have him,' Mr Osang told MailOnline.

Nothing left: Neighbours said they heard the blast more than a mile away and it sounded like an earthquake

Emergency response: Firefighters and paramedics attended the scene in the village of Caramujeira

'He had been 
very ill with heart problems and hadn't been exhibiting for five years, 
but started again after he had a heart operation and had an implant put 
in.

'He was an incredibly 
warm person and a loving person and of course, such a loving person was 
much loved by those who knew him too.

Well-loved: Mr Uzzell was born in Swindon, Wiltshire and studied at Goldsmith's in London

'He had the most wonderful house. He built it all himself with his partner and they had two pieces by David Hockney in the house, as well as a separate studio with his own works which I believe have been destroyed.

'He came often to the gallery and was very sociable.

'He was such a happy person and he came to the gallery only last Friday, completely jubilant about life and his recovering health.

'It's hit me and others in the art community here terribly.

'People felt the blast a mile and a half away. We have many small earthquakes here and it felt like one of those.'

In a biography on his website, the artist wrote: 'My work is greatly influenced by the environment.

'Subjects are alluded to but not with straightforward representation.

'Time, place and mood play their part in images that are ostensibly abstract but reveal a point of contact with the visual world.'

Mr Uzzell is believed to have a sister from Britain who visited him in Portugal earlier this year.

A Foreign Office spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Lagoa, Algarve. We stand ready to provide consular assistance.'
