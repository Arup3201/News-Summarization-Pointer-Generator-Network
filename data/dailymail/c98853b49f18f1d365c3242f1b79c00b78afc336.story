A man convicted of coldly strangling his wife and leaving her body in a Massachusetts parking lot will be the first inmate in the nation to receive sexual reassignment surgery paid for by the state, a federal judge ruled today.

Robert Kosilek, who has been known as Michelle for more than a decade, has already received hormone treatments, psychotherapy and electrolysis while serving a life sentence as a woman in an all-male prison. While imprisoned, she has tried to commit suicide twice and tried to castrate herself.

U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf ruled today that Kosilek, who was convicted of first degree murder in the killing of his wife Cheryl in 1990, has won the right to receive a $20,000, state-funded sex change operation because it is a 'serious medical need'.

Prison officials have opposed the decision based on the safety of Kosilek, saying that her housing and security needs would be impossible to meet as she would surely be a target for assault.

Victory: Robert Kosilek, who has been known as Michelle for more than a decade, has already received hormone treatments, psychotherapy and electrolysis while serving a life sentence as a woman in an all-male prison. Michelle is pictured on January 15, 1993 in Bristol County Superior Court, in New Bedford, Massachusetts

Convicted: Robert Kosilek was convicted of murder in the killing of his wife in 1990. He is pictured on May 24, 1990, being led to the county jail following his arraignment on drunken driving charges, in New Rochelle, NY

According to court documents, Kosilek began transitioning to a female after his arrest and indictment.

He first launched his campaign against the Massachusetts Department of Correction 12 years ago. 

'Everybody has the right to have 
their health care needs met, whether they are in prison or out on the 
streets,' Kosilek said last year from a state 
prison in Norfolk, Mass.

'People in the prisons who have bad hearts, hips or knees have 
surgery to repair those things.'

She continued: 'My medical needs are no less important or more important than the person in the cell next to me.'

In 2002, Wolf ruled that Kosilek was entitled to treatment for gender-identity disorder, but stopped short of ordering surgery. She was also granted electrolysis treatment and hormone therapy.

Kosilek sued again in 2005, arguing that the surgery is a medical necessity.

In his ruling Tuesday, Wolf found that surgery is the 'only adequate treatment' for Kosilek's 'serious medical need.'

'The court finds that there is no less intrusive means to correct the prolonged violation of Kosilek's Eighth Amendment right to adequate medical care,' Wolf wrote in his 126-page ruling.

Prison officials have repeatedly cited security concerns in the case, saying that allowing her to have the surgery would make her a target for sexual assaults by other inmates.

Massachusetts Correction Commissioner Kathleen Dennehy has said that if Kosilek has the surgery, the consequences would be unprecedented. 

'The safety and security concerns are enormous,' Dennehy testified, according to CBS.

But Wolf found that the DOC's security concerns are 'either pretextual or can be dealt with by the DOC.'

He said it is up to prison officials to decide how and where to house Kosilek after the surgery.

Cheryl Kosilek was found dead in the back seat of her car in a shopping mall parking lot on Sunday, May 20, 1990.

Markings showed she had been strangled with a rope and a wire and a taxicab driver testified in court that he had picked up Kosilek from that very mall in the afternoon and driven him home.

A few hours later, Kosilek called police to report his wife missing, suggesting that she might have gotten into a car accident.

Cheryl Kosilek was found dead in the back seat of her car in a shopping mall parking lot on Sunday, May 20, 1990.

had picked up Kosilek from that very mall in the afternoon and driven 
him home.

A few hours later, Kosilek called police to report his wife missing, suggesting that she might have gotten into a car accident.

Police picked him up at his Mansfield home and questioned him, telling him that 'a body was found in the back seat' of Cheryl's abandoned vehicle.

Kosilek said his wife was at work all day and had intended to stop by the mall afterwards and that he was busy at the couple's home all day.

Timothy McCaul, Cheryl's 15-year-old son who lived with the couple, said that he called home for a ride around 5 p.m. and no one answered the phone.

Kosilek was questioned again, only this time he left half way through the interview and said he was getting an attorney.

Two days later, Kosilek was involved in a car crash at midnight. Officers found him in the driver's seat dressed in women's clothing and sent him home.

On May 24, 1990, Kosilek was stopped for speeding in New Rochelle, New York, and arrested him for drunk driving.

'You would be drunk too if the police thought you killed your wife,' he said.

Later, at the police station, the defendant stated, 'Look, I had a fifteen year old son and a wife. I can't call my wife. I murdered my wife. Now, I need to call a psychiatrist now.'

He later admitted to a reporter that 
he and his wife got into a heated argument during the day and she had 
thrown boiling water in his face.

He picked up a wire and blacked out, waking up days later in the hospital.

'Apparently, I did take her life,' he told the reporter. 'It was probably in self defense.'

After he was indicted for the crime, he began the transition from male to female and legally changed his name to Michelle.

Kosilek's lawsuit has become fodder for radio talk shows and lawmakers who say the state should not be forced to pay for a convicted murderer's sex-change operation – which can cost up to $20,000 – especially since many insurance companies reject the surgery as elective.

Wolf noted that Kosilek's gender-identity disorder has caused Kosilek such anguish that she has tried to castrate herself and twice tried to commit suicide, including once while on Prozac.

Kosilek's lead attorney, Frances Cohen, called the decision courageous and thoughtful.

'We feel very grateful that the judge listened very carefully to the medical experts and has given Michelle Kosilek what the prison doctors had recommended,' Cohen said.

Inmates in Colorado, California, Idaho 
and Wisconsin have sued unsuccessfully to try to get the surgery, making
similar arguments that denying it violates the U.S. Constitution's 
protection against cruel and unusual punishment.

'This is not a choice. Transsexuals are born and not made,' said psychiatry professor George R. Brown at East Tennessee State University.

'If you didn't have this condition, why would you want to have your genitals removed, if not by a competent surgeon but by your own hand?'

According to research by Brown, about 27,000 people nationwide have gender identity disorder. Experts estimate 500 to 750 Americans undergo the surgery each year, with hundreds more seeking the procedure abroad.

Federal courts have said prisons must provide adequate medical care, and that they must protect inmates from themselves. But correctional officials and lawmakers balk at using taxpayer money for sex-change operations that can cost up to $20,000.

Brown estimates that at least 750 of the more than 2 million prisoners nationwide had gender identity disorder in 2007, his latest count.
