A cruise ship worker groped a sleeping female passenger during an excursion to the Bahamas over the weekend, federal authorities charge.

Prosecutors say the attack occurred Dec. 23, when 25-year-old Karan Seechurn used his room key to enter the woman's cabin without her knowledge or permission.

She awoke to find Seechurn touching her genitalia and pushed him off.

Federal prosecutors say 25-year-old Karan Seechurn, a cruise ship worker (not pictured), used his work key to enter a female passenger's cabin and groped her while she slept

The victim tried to run away, but he pulled her back —and threatened to burn down the ship if she reported what happened, court records show.

Seechurn was detained early Saturday upon the ship's return from the Bahamas to its port of origin in Bayonne, New Jersey.

He remains in the custody of US Marshals and is charged in Newark Federal Court with abusive sexual contact.

He's represented by a public defender's office, which declined to comment.

Seechurn is from Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean.
