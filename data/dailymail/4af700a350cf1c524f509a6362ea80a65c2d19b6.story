It took a few moments for Pete Barovich to take in what he was seeing. When he did his heart nearly stopped in his chest.

His screen was filled with the official seal of the United States Department of Justice and the words: ‘This site has been seized…’

It was shortly after 9am on 15 April 2011 and Absolute Poker’s Chief Marketing Officer had only one thought, ‘This is it.’

Winning Hand: In 2006 Absolute Poker and its fraternity brother founders seemed unstoppable, life was a whirl of wealth, parties and girls

Today that date is known in the online poker world as Black Friday.

It is the day that the US Department of Justice raided three of the world’s biggest online Poker companies: 76 bank accounts across 14 countries were frozen, billions of dollars of winnings, House ‘raking’s and personal fortunes vanished in a congressional pen-stroke.

Now, a new book traces the chaotic 
fortunes of the six-fraternity brothers from the University of Montana 
who set up Absolute Poker.

Out today, ‘Straight Flush’ by Ben Mezrich chronicles how a weekly poker game in the backroom of a bar in Missoula, Montana was parlayed into one of the biggest online Poker sites in the world.

Taking a chance on a game of skill: Absolute Poker's site as it appeared to players before it was seized

Brent Beckley, his step-brother Scott Tom, Garin Gustafson, Pete Barovich, Shane Blackford and Oscar Hilt Tatum IV bonded as a group in the hedonistic world of fraternity hazing as each was a brother of Sigma Alpha Epsilon at the University of Montana.

It was 2000. Online poker wasn’t a new idea – there were already a few fledgling sites – but the money making potential of the internet had yet to be fully exploited. The brothers thought they could do better. 

Over many Red Bull fuelled hours they set to.They took legal advice and insist that every lawyer they spoke to agreed. ‘If there wasn’t a law that said specifically you couldn’t do it, it was presumed to be perfectly legal.’

The law most commonly applied to online gambling was the Interstate Wire Act of 1961.

It reads: ‘Whoever being engaged in the business of betting or wagering knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the transmission...of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets of wagers on any sporting event or contest, or for the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers...shall be fined under this title or imprisoned…’

The way the Absolute Poker boys saw it this was clearly designed to inhibit sports betting and games of chance. Poker was a game of skill.

Realistically,  for all their subsequent protestations of innocence, the way they went about establishing the business hardly smacks of transparency.

They chose Costa Rica as their base – the location for several similar online business.

They recruited a local expert as consultant who, when pressed on the question of legalities, informed them: ‘This is the Wild West.  And I don’t see any sheriff knocking at our door.’

Having found a base they needed to raise $750,000 start up.

They found willing investors in Korea. They poured the money into the Caribbean bank and were on the cusp of going live when the bank went under.

Mezrich traces their travels from Belize to Korea, Dominica, to Switzerland, Canada, the States and Costa Rica in a bid to raise funds once more.

Stepbrothers Scott Tom and Brent Beckley emerge as the most forceful characters, pushing the project on.

Red Bull gave way to cocaine, the backroom bar in Missoula where the idea was born gave way to the fleshpots of Del Rey. Girls were easy and labour was cheap. 

These guys weren’t internet geeks like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Reddit’s Adam Schwartz or Tumblr’s David Karp.

They were frat brothers keen to cash in and fund a wild lifestyle. And for a while they really did. 

By January 2005 Absolute Poker was valued at thirty million dollars and bringing in about $800,000 a day in revenue. 

Its founders drove fast cars, raced Ducati and BMW bikes and partied hard. But other sites were growing too and some threatened to dwarf Absolute Poker.

By the end of 2006 they recognized two needs: they had to ‘gray it up’ and ‘look clean and pretty.’

Absolute Poker had two years of audited accounts. They needed three to take the company public as was their plan; doing so would make them billionaires. 

Banks were more likely to respect a company that wasn’t entirely run by 25 year olds out of South America. 

So they set up an office in Vancouver and brought more established shareholders on board.The boys continued to party. The banks continued to make money. The company continued to grow at an outrageous rate.

By August 2006 the company had grown more by 100 per cent year on year. They were valued at $100million.

Another day at the office: Costa Rica was the 'ground zero' of similar online businesses and where Absolute Poker was based - the Wild West, with no sign of a Sheriff

But that same summer congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling and Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA). 

Canada’s equivalent of the FBI launched an investigation into the company. The net was beginning to close – the ‘gray legal area’ rapidly hardening to black and white.

To this day Brent Beckley maintains he did not know that any of the Absolute Poker team were doing anything wrong.

He said he’d ‘fooled himself into thinking that what he was doing was okay.’

But on 15 April 2011 all room for doubt was removed.The FBI had been investigating Absolute Poker and other sites for two years.

The Department of Homeland Security had set up a fake payment processing company through which several sites operated, allowing forensic analysis of their finances and, the prosecution argued, attempts to circumvent the law. 

Eleven people were indicted from sites including Absolute Poker, PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and online payment processors. Charges included bank fraud and money laundering.

That only two were indicted from Absolute Poker – brothers Brent and Scott –may have seemed arbitrary but it was hardly something the others were going to contest.

Pete Barovich left his cubicle in Absolute Poker the day the site was seized. He left San Jose, Costa Rica soon after. 

He now lives with his wife and family in Phoenix, Arizona where he runs his own business.

Beckley gave himself up but refused to fully co-operate with the prosecution in return for avoiding jail time.

Instead he plead guilty to misleading banks and on 21 July 2012 was sentenced to 14 months which he is currently serving in a minimum security prison in Denver, Colorado.

Scott was in Antigua where he remains. He is not technically a fugitive as he was not ‘on the run’ but the FBI considers him ‘at large.’

In July 2012 Absolute Poker agreed to pay $731million fine to the US government. But the story does not end quite there.

The final card has not yet been played.

In December 2012 the Department of Justice’s  Office of Legal Counsel finally and officially clarified its position regarding the Wire Act.

The DOJ concluded that the Wire Act only applies to sports betting – just as the boys of Absolute Poker had done more than a decade before.
