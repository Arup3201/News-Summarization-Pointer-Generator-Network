For the sixth time in as many years, world-class athletes have flexed and flaunted their nude physiques for the pages of ESPN The Magazine's annual Body Issue.

And this year, not one, but six individual covers will be released to celebrate. Those to feature include five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams, 18-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps, Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch, Texas Rangers first baseman Prince Fielder, Oklahoma City Thunder forward Serge Ibaka, and Olympic gold-medal-winning snowboarder Jamie Anderson.

'This year's collection of 
exceptional athletes and stunning photography showcases an array of 
sports and body types,' ESPN The Magazine's editor in chief, Chad Millman, announced. 'It inhabits our mission to pay tribute to these 
athletes' bodies and all they are capable of.'

Ravishing: Six nude sports icons each star on their own special covers for ESPN's sixth annual Body Issue, including tennis champion Venus Williams (pictured)

Venus Williams displays her perfectly toned posterior and sleek waist-length locks as she follows in the footsteps of her sister Serena, who appeared on the debut cover of the Body Issue in 2009.

Venus spoke to the publication about her struggles with Sjogren's syndrome, 
an autoimmune disorder that caused her to drop out of tennis for six months between 2011 and 2012.

'At my worst point, I wasn't able to play tennis at all,' the 34-year-old Florida native said. 'Just the whole quality of my life was 
compromised. You are so tired it hurts. You have to accept that you're 
never going to be 100 percent.' Venus went on to explain that the key to her 
rehabilitation has been learning to pace herself.Â

Michael Phelps, who has been taking a break following the 2012 London Summer Olympics, says he is now back from 'retirement,' during which he claims he put on 25lbs.

'I got fat and out of shape,' he reveals. 'I got out of the shower one day, and I'm like: "Wow. What am I doing?" It was all over after that. I lost 25 pounds in probably six weeks - just working out two hours a day, eating healthy. It shed right off.'

As for Super Bowl champion Marshawn Lynch, a running back for the Seattle Seahawks, he knows what he's got and isn't afraid to say so. 'I'm cool with my body, I love my body. I wouldn't trade it for no other body,' he tells the publication.
