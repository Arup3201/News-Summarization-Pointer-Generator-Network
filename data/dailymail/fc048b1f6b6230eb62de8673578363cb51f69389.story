Ill-gotten gains: Prolific burglar Ronnie Tretton

A prolific burglar who had his ill-gotten gains seized has vowed to go on a crime spree once he is released from prison to get the money back.

Ronnie Tretton had more than £1,000 confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Act - but he told a court he would step up his crime rate once he got out of jail.

Tretton, 27, of Leigh-on-Sea, made the comments as he was led to the cells at Southend Magistrates' Court, during a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing.

He shouted from the dock: 'When I get out there will be a lot of burglaries. I will get 
that money back.

'Watch the crime rate when I get out. How about that?'

Tretton, who was dubbed 'one of Southend's most prolific burglars', was the first person in the Essex town to be given an Asbo in 2003. He has 88 previous offences, including 25 theft-related crimes, the court was told.

He was taken to court after police found a large sum of cash on him. On this occasion he was arrested in suspicion of burglary - for which he was never charged - and police secured a court order to keep most of the money.

Fiona
Philpott, prosecuting on behalf of Essex Police, said: 'Mr Tretton is 
one of the most prolific burglars within the Southend area and is 
currently on bail relating to a burglary committed on June 24, the day 
before the money was seized.'

She said police believed the money had come from the burglary on June 23, or other burglaries he had been involved in.

The
court heard he had been bailed until February 20 accused of four 
different burglaries but he is currently in prison, having been 
convicted of a separate domestic assault.

Miss
Philpott added: 'It's also apparent from analysis of his mobile phone 
that he is expected by at least one friend to supply drugs.'

Tretton said the £1287.68 police found him with was money he was looking after on behalf of someone else.

He said his relative, Christine Tretton, of Southend, was an alcoholic and had given him the cash so she wouldn't spend it.

However, when police first interviewed her she said she had given Tretton just £250.

But
Miss Tretton told the court this was because she had been drunk at the 
time she gave her statement to police, and actually it was £1,240.

Tretton is currently in jail after appearing at Southend Magistrates Court on January 9, where he pleaded guilty to assault.

He was subject to recall to prison at the time, and was jailed for six weeks.

A restraining order was also made to prevent him from contacting the victim, Geneve Davis, for the next two years.

Tretton will lose £1,037.68 of the cash, and he and Miss Tretton must pay £700 court costs between them.
