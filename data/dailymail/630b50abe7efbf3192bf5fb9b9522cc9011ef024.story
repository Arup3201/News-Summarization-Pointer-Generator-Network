For a man who ‘loves a game of bingo’, George Osborne appeared to need help yesterday in telling his two little ducks from his two fat ladies.

‘How do you know the numbers?’ he asked Shirley Nixon during a visit to Cardiff to publicise the cut in bingo tax unveiled in the Budget.

Having been shown how to mark his card, Mr Osborne, who had been among politicians rushing to profess their love of the game after the Government was accused of patronising the working classes, nearly scooped the £300 prize pool.

Chancellor George Osborne shared a laugh with fellow bingo player Shirley Nixon

The Chancellor visited Castle Bingo in Cardiff to promote his halving of bingo tax to 10 per cent in last week's Budget

After having fun playing one game, Mr Osborne stayed for a second and came withing three numbers of winning the £300 jackpot

‘I never expected to give the Chancellor a lesson in bingo,’ said Mrs 
Nixon. ‘He asked what to do and I told him – and he was brilliant at it.
 But then you would expect him to be good with figures, wouldn’t you?’

Her
 husband, Colin, said: ‘He didn’t ask us many questions because he was 
concentrating. On the last game, he was only three numbers off from 
winning.’

Despite his apparent ignorance of the game, the Chancellor came close to bagging £300 for 
himself  when he went eyes 
down at a bingo hall in Cardiff.

The Chancellor has spent the week meeting
 and greeting across the country, tying his hand at driving a train, 
pulling a pint, tightening bolts in a factory and eyeing up the new £1 
coin.

But it was his attempt to play bingo which was the most striking. Last week Mr Osborne boasted: ‘I drink beer and I love a game of bingo.’

In last week’s Budget Mr Osborne sought to woo blue collar voters by halving duty on bingo to 10 per cent and taking a penny off a pint of beer.

He then signed off a Conservative party advert to promote the policy which stated: ‘Bingo! Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy.’

But the use of the word ‘they’ was widely criticised, with the Lib Dems call it ‘silly’ and Labour saying it was ‘condescending’.

George Osborne has been accused before of changing his speech to sound less posh.

But today there was a debate about whether he was talking mockney or Westcountry.

The Chancellor paid a visit to the Royal Mint in Llantrisant after he announced last week that the £1 coin is to be replaced.

The new 12-sided coin modelled on the old thrupenny bit is to be put into circulation by 2017.

While watching coins coming off the production line, Mr Osborne was seen telling workers: ‘It’s gonna be great, innit?’

It was suggested he was trying to sound like a London teenager by using 'innit' but others insisted it was more Westcountry.

Yesterday Mr Osborne was pictured 
awkwardly supping a pint of beer and today’s photo opportunity involved a
 game or two of bingo.

The 
millionaire Chancellor took part in a £1 main game session alongside 
bingo regulars, who helped the multi-millionaire keep tabs on his 
numbers.

Having planned to stay for one game he was having so much fun he ended up staying for a second, when he came within three numbers of winning the £300 jackpot.

Bingo regular Margaret Evans, 73, of Cardiff, who was in the bingo hall with Mr Osborne, said: ‘He looked like he enjoyed himself.

‘I was quite surprised when I came down here today and heard that the Chancellor of the Exchequer - who's mega rich - would be coming to play a game of bingo.

She joked: ‘I just hope the economy isn't that bad that George Osborne needs to find a few quid from playing bingo!’

Yesterday Mr Osborne was pictured sipping
 the top out of a pint of Sunbeam ale during a visit to Marston's 
Brewery in Wolverhampton.

Sunbeam
 is described as a ‘gloriously zesty blonde beer with a 4.2% ABV brewed 
to be easy drinking and refreshing with a clean long finish’.

Writing
 on Twitter, Mr Osborne said: ‘Great to visit Marston's brewery in 
Wolverhampton with @pauluppalmp. They're creating 3,000 new jobs. From 
today - another penny off a pint.’

Today his tour took in the Royal Mint and Tata Steel's Port Talbot works. Mr Osborne said the Government's annual spending plan would boost big industry via a £7 billion promise to reduce energy costs.

‘Welsh manufacturing is some of the best in the world,’ the Chancellor said.‘There is no reason why Wales and Britain cannot lead the world in advanced manufacturing.’Karl Kohler, the boss of Tata Steel's European operations, welcomed the Government's plans.

‘The measures announced in the Budget to introduce relief against the rapidly rising costs of energy taxes, which pose a very real risk to Britain's foundation industries, are extremely welcome.’

Hands on: Later Mr Osborne was shown how to drive a train during a visit to Tata Steel

The Budget announced support for energy intensive manufacturing, including plants like Tata's Port Talbot factory which is the largest steel plant in the UK, producing five million tonnes of steel annually and employing over 4,000 people

The Port Talbot steelworks employs more than 3,000 staff, with a 1,000-strong contractor workforce.Its fortunes dipped during the recession, but bosses are targeting the production of 4.3 million tonnes of steel by the end of the year.

In a bid to shake-off the Tory reputation for being out-of-touch, Mr Osborne has made a concerted effort to tour the country - often donning hi-vis to prove he is getting on with a tough job.

Yesterday Mr Osborne tried his hand at some engineering work during a visit to Cube Precision Engineering in Rowley Regis, West Midlands.

He also took tea with the Very Rev'd Dr John Davies, Dean of Derby, after a visit to Derby Cathedral.

Today he was shown how to drive a train during a visit to Tata Steel to see how it has been affected by the budget.
