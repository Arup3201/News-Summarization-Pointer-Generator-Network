A British couple robbed while holidaying in France believe the thieves knocked them unconscious by piping gas into their camper van.

Debbie Keeney, 54, and Bob John, 68, were just ten days into a month-long trip when they were targeted after stopping at services.

Police in Lancon de Provence, some 30 miles from Marseilles, believe the couple fell victim to an Eastern European gang, following a string of similar attacks on tourists. The couple lost around £200 cash, £300-worth of jewellery, passports and credit and debit cards in the attack, which left Miss Keeney feeling ‘violated’ and ‘shaken’.

Debbie Keeney, 54, and her partner Bob John, 68, from Manston, Kent, were just ten days into their annual month-long trip to France when the terrifying raid took place

The couple woke at the service station where they had stopped for the night and noticed the curtains in the front of their camper van were open and the driver’s door was slightly ajar.

Local police suspect that they were gassed after receiving reports of Eastern European gangs preying on holidaymakers in the same way. Miss Keeney believes it is the only way they would have been robbed because she would have heard intruders.

‘I realised that someone had been inside the van so got up and noticed the door and curtains open and that my handbag was gone,’ she said.

‘The gassing thing happened to a friend of ours in England so it made me think the same thing must have happened to us.

‘We didn’t hear a thing and we are both light sleepers – especially in the camper van, where you feel and hear absolutely everything – so I’m sure we would’ve woken up. We also both had a thick head and a sore throat in the morning and just felt ill. Whatever we were breathing in wasn’t nice.’

Miss Keeney and Mr John, from Manston, Kent, left the service station and reported the theft to police. They carried on with their holiday but had to spend £200 on emergency passports so they could return to the UK on July 6.

Miss Keeney said: ‘It’s horrible. The thought of someone in my bedroom while we were both asleep is terrifying and makes you feel violated.

‘It hasn’t put us off going on another holiday like this because we’ve been doing it for the last 15 years and we don’t want them to feel like they’ve won.

‘We’re going to beef up the security on the van though. At the moment we have general locks and an alarm but it’s a motion sensor so we couldn’t have it on when we were sleeping.

‘You just don’t think things like this will happen to you though, so we assumed the locks we had would be fine.’

A police spokesman said: ‘They release a knockout gas through van air vents or windows – and can then rob the vehicle without anyone knowing. It’s been blighting this area for years.’

There have been previous reports of British motorhomers being targeted in this way and the Foreign Office has issued warnings.

It advises travellers to avoid staying overnight in roadside rest areas or car parks – warnings repeated by the major motorhome and caravan clubs and endorsed by Miss Keeney.

‘I would recommend going to a secure campsite in the future but at the time we thought we would be safe,’ she said. ‘Everyone’s had a kip at the side of the road before so it didn’t cross our minds this could happen.

‘We were obviously left feeling shaken up by the whole thing but we’re just thankful nothing worse happened to us and that it didn’t ruin our holiday.’

Despite the couple’s experience and similar reports previously, some experts remain sceptical that thieves would have the necessary expertise and equipment to render their victims unconscious by using gas.

The Royal College of Anaesthetists believes it would be impossible. It has issued a statement saying: ‘Even the more powerful modern volatile agents would need to be delivered in tankerloads of carrier gas by a large compressor.’
