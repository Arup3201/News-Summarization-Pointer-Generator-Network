Earl Spencer has said he wishes he had gone to a state school because of the cruel treatment meted out to boys at his prep school.

Princess Diana’s younger brother said pupils judged to be stupid or lazy were ‘really unpleasantly’ beaten with a cane on their bare buttocks every week.

The aristocrat claimed that he had six months of sleepless nights before being sent away aged eight to board at Maidwell Hall preparatory school in Northampton in the early 1970s.

‘I said I wanted to go to a state school because it must be preferable to 13-week blocks away in a rather cold and unpleasant place,’ he told TES magazine.

Earl Spencer, 50, described Maidwell Hall’s regime as ‘quite tough’, with a ‘slightly terrifying’ headmaster and military-style drill for the boys in the mornings.

He did not say whether he himself suffered the weekly cane beatings at the 104-year-old school.

But he claimed that some members of staff expected little of him because of his privileged upbringing.

‘To be totally candid, I think, coming from my background, teachers had absolutely no expectations of me,’ he said.

It now costs £7,980 a term for a pupil to board at the school disliked by the Earl, pictured as a boy with Diana at Park House, Sandringham, in the summer of 1967

‘They just thought I’d be fine in life anyway. I was lucky enough to drift through.’

Earl Spencer, now a thrice-married father of seven, claimed that he got through his time at prep school by succeeding in his exams and some sports.

The earl once fondly recounted how he was able to correct a history master at the prep school on the topic of the Blenheim estate.

He said: ‘It was a triumph over a very nasty man and I owe Blenheim a debt to this day. He was a socialist who resented that everyone in the class was called Guinness, Whitbread or Spencer.’

Former pupils of the preparatory school also include former Conservative MP Sir Adam Butler and John Ailwyn Fellowes, 4th Baron de Ramsey, a landowner who became the first chairman of the Environment Agency.

Well-educated: After attending Maidwell Hall, the Earl went on to study at Eton then Oxford

Earl Spencer went on to study at Eton College alongside London Mayor Boris Johnson and former Thai prime minister Mark Vejjajiva.

He later read modern history at Magdalen College, Oxford. Born in 1964, Charles Spencer lived with Diana and his two other sisters Sarah and Jane at Park House in Sandringham until the death of their grandfather, the 7th Earl Spencer.

He was aged five when his parents divorced and Diana once said: ‘It was a very unhappy childhood. Always seeing my mother crying and Daddy never spoke to us about it.’ The family moved to its ancestral seat at Althorp House, a Northamptonshire stately home dating back to 1508, in 1975.

But Charles hated life at Althorp, and once said: ‘It was like an old man’s club with lots of clocks ticking away. For an impressionable child, it was a nightmarish place.’

Maidwell Hall, where fees for borders are now £23,940 a year and girls have been accepted since 2010, could not be reached for comment yesterday.

But the school’s former headmaster John Paul has previously suggested that Earl Spencer may have exaggerated how bad his time there was.

‘He’s been in constant touch with the school ever since, so I don’t think he could have been that unhappy,’ Mr Paul said in 1992.
