A British TV producer was killed in Qatar when a speeding motorcyclist hit her while racing a friend at high speed.

Kerry Rome, 33, moved to Qatar to work for TV news station Al-Jazeera, and had been out with colleagues before being knocked down as she crossed the road at 2am, an inquest heard.

She was the TV station's first female technical director, and moved to the Middle East for work with her husband Mark Harris, 35.

Police initially believed Mrs Rome's death was accidental - but it later emerged that the motorbike rider had no driving licence, and was racing a friend when he hit Mrs Rome on April 20, 2012.

A 21-year-old man was convicted of killing Kerry in a Qatari court in 2012 with a judge describing his speed as 'excessive'.

An inquest in Stamford, Lincolnshire, heard that the biker hit Mrs Rome - who had just stepped out into the road - while trying to under-take his rival.

Moments after stepping into the road she was struck by the motorcyclist as he attempted to under-take his friend.

Giving evidence, Mrs Rome's mother Margaret, 62, described the moment she found out about her daughter’s death as 'the worst phone call of my life'.

She added: 'My lovely daughter Kerry would be here today if that reckless, dangerous motorcyclist had not been racing with a friend at 2am'.

Mr Harris also paid tribute to his late wife, whom he had married just months before her death in an Elvis-themed Las Vegas wedding.

Mark, originally from Market Deeping Lincolnshire, said: 'Kerry was an amazing person. She was kind, generous, there to help and never had a bad word to say about anyone.

'We were career-oriented adults who relocated abroad to make a good life and good careers for ourselves.

'This was all taken away by a man who was out racing a motorbike with his friends.'

A toxicology report carried out in Qatar found 296mg of alcohol per 100ml in Kerry’s blood, around three-and-a-half times the British drink-drive limit.

Three of Mrs Rome's colleagues told the hearing she did not appear drunk on the night she died.

Oliver Walker said: 'We had a few drinks but nothing major as we were dancing close to the stage. It’s not like we were pounding shots at the bar'.

South Lincolnshire coroner Professor Robert Forrest said: 'It had appeared that the motorcyclist was undertaking one of his companions when the collision took place.'

He added that there was insufficient evidence to produce a verdict of unlawful killing, instead recording the incident as a death caused as a result of a road traffic collision.

A friend of the family said today: 'The family are obviously disappointed that the coroner effectively delivered a verdict of accidental death.

'It is the family’s position that Kerry was not killed in an accident. The motorcyclist hit her during an illegal road race.

'If he had not been taking part in an illegal activity Kerry would still be here today.'

Kerry and her husband Mark moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2008 when she became the first female technical director of live news at Al Jazeera English.

They then transferred to Doha in October 2011 when Kerry was promoted to Al Jazeera English’s head office.

Speaking after the inquest, her mother said: 'She was such a vivacious person and so full of life. Considering how young she was she has done so much in her life.

'When we went out there and saw what life was like we realised how strong a person she was. We are all so incredibly proud of her and what she did.'

Kirsty Rome, her sister, added: 'We were all really close, she loved her family. She did more in her 33 years than most do in a lifetime.'
