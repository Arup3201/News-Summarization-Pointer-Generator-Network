A care worker has today admitted targeting a professional poker player as part of a 'honeytrap' robbery but denied luring him to his death, a court heard.

Leonie Granger, 25, swapped numbers with 56-year-old Mehmet Hassan after meeting him at a casino in Mayfair in London's West End.

The father-of-three was found dead a month later after he invited Granger back to his flat in Islington, north London, following a night out, where he was allegedly tied up and beaten.

Granger told the Old Bailey the plan was discussed with her boyfriend Kyrron Jackson and his friend Nicholas Chandler, both 28, on the day she met Mr Hassan - February 25 last year.

She said: ‘That’s when they first said something about getting someone’s number, get their number and then we’d rob them.’

Asked what words they used, she replied: ‘Honeytrap. Like getting their phone nicked or something, nothing serious. Just go to the casino, get someone’s number, come back out, that was it.’

Her barrister Orlando Pownall QC asked her whether there was any discussion of the consequences to the victim or to herself, which she denied.

Later that night Jackson and Chandler dropped her off at the Palm Beach Casino and parked around the corner.

She said she was dressed casual in a pair of boots, a dress and a leather jacket when she went inside and met Mr Hassan, who sometimes won as much as £15,000 in one gambling session.

‘He said he liked my hair. He offered to get me a drink, asked me what I was doing there,’ said Granger. ‘I said I was just looking around the casino, see what it’s like.’

Granger admitted using the name ‘Rachel’ when she gave him her phone number.

The next day Mr Hassan texted her: ‘Left just after you, did you get home alright? Mehmet’.

Granger, who worked at a care home for elderly people with dementia in Gillingham, Kent, replied: ‘I am working until 7 lol. What you do? Do you live around West End or just socialise?’

Granger exchanged numbers with Mr Hassan and the pair began texting before arranging a night out in March last year - the night before he died

Mr Hassan replied: ‘I live in Islington, I’m a professional poker player. Don’t laugh Rachel because believe me I’m quite good. With your brains and my money we can make you into a great player.’

Granger then said: ‘I would like to become a good player just don’t have the funds to get into it.’

His reply said: ‘Funds is my department Rachel, please it will be my pleasure to wine and dine you.’

Granger told the court that she told Jackson and Chandler she had spoken to someone in the casino but 'that was it'.

When asked how much time she had put into the whole project, she told the court that at this stage 'not a lot'.  

Mr Hassan was allegedly tied up and kicked to death after he took Miss Granger back to his north London flat in the early hours of March 24, last year.

He was found lying in a pool of blood in his bedroom after his sister, Abide Ispanedi, raised the alarm at 9pm.

A pathologist concluded his death was ‘multi-factorial’ and consistent with kicks to the head, neck and chest.

Granger, Chandler and Jackson were all arrested soon after police launched a murder investigation. 

Film footage found on Granger’s phone showed all three smiling and laughing while handling wads of £50 notes stolen from Mr Hassan, it is claimed.

Granger denies murder and conspiracy to falsely imprison Mr Hassan but has admitted her part in the robbery of Mr Hassan.

Chandler and Jackson also deny two further counts of conspiracy to commit robbery, two count of conspiracy to possess firearms with intent, two counts of conspiracy to possess imitation firearms and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison.

The trial continues.
