America's largest student lender Sallie Mae has agreed to pay $60 million to service members for charging them excessive interest rates on their student loans.

It means some 60,000 active-duty personnel could be in line for refunds having overpaid on their loans as far back as 2005.

The deal settles a government lawsuit which alleged that the student loan giant violated the rights of service members by imposing interest rates above the six per cent permitted by federal law and by improperly seeking default judgments against them.

Up to 60,000 US service members could be in line for refunds after Sallie Mae agreed to pay millions of dollars in fines

Meanwhile, in a separate case the company has also been ordered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to refund military members up to $30 million in late fees calculated on loans. The firm has also been slapped with a civil fine of $6.6 million.

The lawsuit was the Justice Department's first against owners of student loans.

Attorney General Eric Holder said: 'We are sending a clear message to all lenders and servicers who would deprive our service members of the basic benefits and protections to which they are entitled: this type of conduct is more than just inappropriate; it is inexcusable, and it will not be tolerated.'

Federal officials estimate that around 60,000 service members will be eligible for compensation as part of the settlement.

An independent administrator will be assigned to distribute the reimbursements.

The settlement has been filed in federal court in Delaware and is awaiting a judge's approval.

As part of the deal, Sallie Mae would also be required to ask the three major credit bureaus to delete negative credit histories resulting from the overcharges.

Sallie Mae has said it had 
'voluntarily settled' the charges and that it regretted 'any convenience
 or hardship' that customers experienced.

A
 statement added: 'We appreciate the service of the men and women who 
safeguard our freedom, and we are committed to meeting their needs.'
