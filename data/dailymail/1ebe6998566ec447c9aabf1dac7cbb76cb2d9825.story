It sounds like a tough sell - water created from human waste.

However, Bill Gates has backed a new hi-tech water plant than could bring clean water to Africa - and has even drunk it.

The Microsoft founder has backed a Seattle firm's radical machine that uses a combination of steam and filters to convert human waste into water the firm says it indistinguishable from bottled water.

'I watched the piles of feces go up the conveyer belt and drop into a large bin,' said Bill Gates on his Blog, before declating the final product 'as good as anything I've drunk out of a bottle.'

At least 2 billion, use latrines that aren’t properly drained, while others simply defecate out in the open. 

The waste contaminates drinking water for millions of people, with horrific consequences:

Diseases caused by poor sanitation kill some 700,000 children every year, and they prevent many more from fully developing mentally and physically. 

Called the OmniProcessor, the new kind of low-cost waste treatment plant has been backed by the Gates Foundation, and is about to be tested in Senegal for the first time. 

'I watched the piles of feces go up the conveyer belt and drop into a large bin,' said Bill Gates on his Blog.

'They made their way through the machine, getting boiled and treated. 

'A few minutes later I took a long taste of the end result: a glass of delicious drinking water.'

In the video showing the moment Gates drinks the water, he does look slightly concerned.

However, after a taste, he laughs.

'It tastes as good as anything I've drunk out of a bottle,' he said.  

'And having studied the engineering behind it, I would happily drink it every day. It’s that safe.'

Each roughly $1.5-million plant can process sewage for a community of about 100,000 people, the firm behind it says.

The machine runs at such a high temperature (1000 degrees Celsius) that there’s no nasty smell; in fact it meets all the emissions standards set by the U.S. government. 

Each roughly $1.5-million plant can process sewage for a community of about 100,000 people, the firm behind it says.

'It’s the ultimate example of that old expression: one man’s trash is another man’s treasure,' said Gates. 

Gates says Western toilets aren’t the answer, 'because they require a massive infrastructure of sewer lines and treatment plants that just isn’t feasible in many poor countries. So a few years ago our foundation put out a call for new solution.'

The plan is for the Omniprocessor to act as a safe repository for human waste. 

In many places without modern sewage systems, truckers take the waste from latrines and dump it into the nearest river or the ocean—or at a treatment facility that doesn’t actually treat the sewage. 

'If we get it right, it will be a good example of how philanthropy can provide seed money that draws bright people to work on big problems, eventually creating a self-supporting industry,' says Gates.

'Our foundation is funding Janicki to do the development. 

'It’s really amazing to see how they’ve embraced the work; founder Peter Janicki and his family have traveled to Africa and India multiple times so they can see the scope of the problem.'

The machines heats the sludge until it boils, and water exits the dryer as steam. 

At this temperature, pathogens cannot survive.

While the water is in the vapour phase, it is filtered to remove particles. 

The contraption then take this bio-safe steam and condense it to water before putting it through water treatment.

The machine's water treatment adjusts the pH, and uses multiple filters to ensure safe, clear, great tasting water. 

The water is indistinguishable from bottled water. 

The foundation now plans to set up an Omniprocessor in Dakar, Senegal, where they’ll study everything from how you connect with the local community (the team is already working with leaders there) to how you pick the most convenient location. 

They will also test a system of sensors and webcams that will let Janicki’s engineers control the processor remotely and communicate with the team in Dakar so they can diagnose any problems that come up.
