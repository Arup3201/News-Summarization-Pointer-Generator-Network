Fulham boss Kit Symons has received public backing from chairman Shahid Khan despite a run of eight games without a win which has seen the club slip back into relegation trouble.

Khan, writing in the programme for Saturday's game against Derby, has made it clear, however, that there were funds made available during the January transfer window which Symons chose not to spend.

The American tycoon, aware of the disruption caused by instability since he arrived at Craven Cottage in 2013, has told his manager he trusts him as the football expert and admires his faith in the current squad.

Khan said: 'We were certainly mindful of the January transfer window and the opportunities – or temptations - it offers. For every successful move in the transfer season there may be half a dozen that fail to produce results, as supporters of Fulham and likely every club in England understand all too well.

'Nevertheless, while caution is advised when browsing the transfer market, clubs should be prepared to pounce if the right player is available at the right time.

'At Fulham, we were prepared with the appropriate resources and full authority if it made perfect sense. Manager Kit Symons sees our players daily. As a top-flight player not that long ago, Kit knows and feels the game.

'He understands and appreciates the Fulham way. And Kit knows what we all want, and that's a side that will make us proud and compete for a return to the Premier League.

Khan hopes his players will repay their manager's faith as the club battles against consecutive relegation

'It's good to have someone as our manager who wants to achieve success in a proper manner. So, I have to applaud Kit for his discipline and restraint during this particular January transfer window when the easy and likely popular move would have been to spend for the sake of appearing to be active.

'The truth is, Kit was active. Kit didn't feel the right options were there. As you all know, Fulham endured some drama over the past 18 months with our managers.'

Symons became Khan's fourth manager in little more than a year in control when he replaced Felix Magath in September. Magath came in after Rene Meulensteen and Martin Jol but was unable to prevent relegation from the Barclays Premier League last year.

Fulham improved after a poor start to the season but have not won since the transfer market closed. Distant play-off hopes have faded, they have slipped back towards the bottom of the Championship and face in-form Derby next.

Khan added: 'We've become a more cohesive club, on and off the pitch, since Kit was promoted to manager in September. There's a lot of football left this season. I'm confident we'll finish the season safe, sound and strong.

Shahid Khan has had four managers since taking over the club, but is now looking for stability under Symons

'But in any event, I pay great respect to Kit for having faith in and standing by the players we've had all season to send us upward. What can be better than having a manager who has unconditional faith in you?

'The hope here is that our squad honours Kit's faith and responds appropriately and immediately with Saturday's encounter against Derby. A positive result against the league leaders in front of the home supporters would do nicely.

'In the meantime, I want to assure all Fulham fans that Kit and the Club will always have my full commitment and attention. If Kit feels there's an option to consider during the emergency transfer period, he'll have my total support to act.

'There will be no uncertainty or lack of communication, as I speak at great length with Kit, Mike Rigg and Alistair Mackintosh every Monday, at a minimum.

'They're all aware of my trust and support in each of them. And the same applies for everyone at Motspur Park and Craven Cottage. We have a great club at Fulham, and we will fight through this difficult stretch successfully, united as one.'
