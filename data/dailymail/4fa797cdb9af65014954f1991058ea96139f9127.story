South Africa have returned to the top of the Reliance ICC ODI Team Rankings for the first time in five years.

The Proteas' 72-run victory in their second ODI against New Zealand on Friday was enough to see them reclaim top spot, despite the third and final ODI being washed out on Monday.

South Africa were one point behind Australia in the rankings before the series in New Zealand and they have now done enough to move in front.

The last time South Africa topped the list was in September 2009, but their first-round elimination from the ICC Champions Trophy that year saw Australia overtake them.

There was further good news for the Proteas in the Reliance ICC ODI Player Rankings, with one-day skipper AB de Villiers and Hashim Amla occupying the top two places in the batting table after the 2-0 series win in New Zealand.

De Villiers retained his No 1 berth, but scores of 38 and 119 for Amla during the series have cut the gap to 28 ratings points as preparations for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 gather pace.

India's Virat Kohli, who has slipped to third following Amla's climb, will have a chance to move up the order when he takes to the field against Sri Lanka in the series which starts on November 2.

In the Reliance ICC Players Rankings for ODI Bowlers South Africa's Dale Steyn remains third after posting figures of one wicket for 28 runs and two for 35 runs.

England are fifth in the ODI rankings with James Anderson the fourth-best bowler.
