British scientists have embarked on a mission worthy of Willy Wonka – to save the world’s chocolate supplies.

With global demand for chocolate soaring and disease ravaging crops in the world’s biggest cocoa-producing countries, the scientists are battling to develop hardier and more productive cocoa plants.

The Mail on Sunday has been given exclusive access to the epicentre of the British effort to save chocolate: a high-security £1 million greenhouse in Berkshire.

Here, a team from Reading University is hard at work on the project – dubbed ‘Operation Wonka’ after the character Willy Wonka in Roald Dahl’s classic children’s book Charlie And The Chocolate Factory.

The ‘Willy Wonka’ of the operation is Paul Hadley, a professor of horticulture, who explains that the ‘Chocolate Factory’, or International Cocoa Quarantine Centre, was set up to ensure that the global supply of chocolate can keep up with booming demand, which is being fuelled by the sweet-toothed Chinese. 

He said: ‘Our aim is to provide new genetic plant material for cocoa-producers which will help them by giving them better-quality and more productive cocoa beans. The drive is to find disease-resistant and highest yielding varieties.’

Most of the chocolate eaten in Britain is made from cocoa beans produced in Ghana and Ivory Coast in West Africa. But a virus called cocoa swollen shoot and an insect called a mirid are devastating crops there.

Prof Hadley says the producers in West Africa want to try new varieties grown in Venezuela and Indonesia, but they don’t want to run the risk of introducing diseases and pests associated with those crops.

‘This is where we have a pivotal position,’ added Prof Hadley. ‘We receive a South American variety and quarantine it here for three months to ensure it is disease-free. We then grow, observe and test the plants for two years, and when we are happy the variety is safe, we send a cutting to Ghana. These are then propagated.

‘Without this facility there is a real danger people might be tempted to sidestep the safe movement routes for plants and bring in a plant that could destroy their crops.’

In the 11,000 sq ft greenhouse in Berkshire, 400 different types of cocoa plant are being nurtured. The plants, which are between 7ft and 9ft tall, are arranged in rows in a polythene-roofed hothouse where temperatures are kept at tropical levels. More than 1,000 gallons of water a day are pumped over the plants by an automatic system and a close eye is kept on them for signs of disease.

Plants are also monitored for growth rates and pod yields.

The ‘chocolate factory’ costs £160,000 a year to operate, with half of its funding provided by the US Department of Agriculture. The rest comes from the Cocoa Research Association (CRA) – a consortium of chocolate traders and manufacturers. 

CRA chairman Tony Lass said: ‘We are all very proud that Britain, a chocolate-loving nation, is taking on this important role to ensure a better future for cocoa-producers and chocolate supplies.’
