A couple have managed to save their family home by writing steamy e-novels.

Jack and Jasinda Wilder, from Detroit, started writing in their basement in a desperate attempt to raise funds after they lost their income.

They have now sold nearly a million e-books and one of their racy novels even hit the number one spot on Amazon. 

Success: Jack and Jasinda Wilder, from Detroit, started writing in their basement in a desperate attempt to raise funds after they lost their income

Personal publishing house: Writing in their basement they have now sold nearly a million e-books

Difficult time: Jasinda, a music and theater teacher, saw her income cut when a school program was cancelled and Jack had to leave a teaching program when their youngest of their five children contracted a virus

The couple, who only want to be known by their pen names, reckon they were a month away from losing their home, reported CBS News.

Jasinda, a music and theater teacher, saw her income cut when a school program was cancelled.

Then her husband Jack had to leave a teaching program when their youngest of their five children contracted a virus.

Desperate: The couple, who only want to be known by their pen names, reckon they were a month away from losing their home

Moving up: Their romance novel called 'Falling Into You' has appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list

Concerned: The couple were worried about how they were going to provide for their children as their income diminished

In desperation, the Wilders went down to the basement of their house and started frantically writing.

They self-published their first e-book and waited nervously for a respose from readers.

It proved to be a success and the couple soon earned enough to meet their $1,200 monthly mortgage 
payment.

'So we just started writing like mad,' Jasinda said. 'And I think in like six months we put out 20 titles.'

'We decided we weren't gonna leave our house,' she added. 'I think we showered three times.'

With each book, their sales climbed higher and the couple were ecstatic when their romance called Falling Into You - about a girl whose first love dies suddenly - jumped onto the New York Times Best Seller list.

Climbing: The couple's book, left which topped the Amazons best-sellers list. It has not quite reached the dizzy heights of Fifty Shades of Grey, right, but it's on its way
