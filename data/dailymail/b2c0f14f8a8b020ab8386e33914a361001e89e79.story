Animal lovers will appreciate this striking collection of bespoke chairs.

But anyone interested in getting their hands on one of the beast-shaped seats may well need to sit down after looking at the price tag.

Designed by artist Maximo Riera, the five intricately moulded pieces of furniture  range from £35,000 for an octopus creation to £65,000 for a whale.

The Spanish artist has also created chairs shaped as an elephant, walrus, rhinoceros and lion at his studio in Cadiz.

The limited edition 353lb chairs are made in high-density polyurethane, and are held together by a metallic frame.

More than 30 professionals from five different companies have been involved in the process.

Every piece is manufactured to order, taking an average of 11 weeks to produce.

Maximo said: 'Each one is designed to bring together the complex art of human design and nature's splendour, in perfect harmony.

'I wanted to create a stronger link between the spectator, the piece and the surroundings,' said Mr Riera

The whale chair is the most expensive in the collection at £65,000

The artist said: 'I chose the chair because it is an everyday object, something taken as common and banal in our lives'

Polyurethane
is a manufactured material invented in the 1940s which combines the 
flexibility of rubber with the durability of metal.

It is used in a variety of products, from baby toys to aeroplane wings, and is useful for chairs because of its load-bearing qualities.

'Each creation in the collection retains the animal's natural vitality whilst being totally biological accurate in their appearance.'
