Fine weather usually brings a welcome boost for the economy as consumers head outdoors to spend, spend, spend.

But record high temperatures in March have left maple syrup producers in the U.S. feeling as flat as a pancake.

Warm conditions are being blamed for bad-tasting syrup and a fall in supplies of up to 40 per cent.

Sweet or sour? Producers in the U.S. say warm weather has given their maple syrup, usually served with pancakes, a bad taste

Some sugar maple trees, which need freezing temperatures at night to sustain sap production, have dried up early while others have produced syrup with a poor taste.

In northeastern parts of the U.S., where nearly all the country's maple syrup is produced, sugarmakers traditionally gather sap during a six-week season from late February to early April before buds appear on the trees.

But the 2012 season was cut short by the warmest March since records began in 1895.

Alfred Carrier, a sugarmaker in Glover, Vermont, said: 'You take 80 degrees in March by golly it don't help nothing.

'We had quite a lot of off-flavored syrup.

'I don't think you'd want to put it on a pancake.'

Feeling the heat: Some sugar maple trees have dried up early while others have produced syrup with a poor taste

Denise Marshall, owner of syrup distributor D&D Sugarwoods in Glover, said trees that did not dry up prematurely ended up producing 'yucky' syrup.

'It was kind of a disaster,' Marshall said.

Maple syrup production has been increasing in the U.S. over the past decade as a result of new technology and a rising number of trees in production.

It takes about 40 gallons of sap, usually gathered from the tapped trees through plastic tubing using a vacuum system, to yield one gallon of syrup.

Short supply: The U.S. is expected to produce 18million pounds of syrup this year, down from 30million pounds in 2011

Vermont, New York and Maine are the states which produce the most.

Syrup unsuitable for the breakfast table is typically sold for industrial purposes such as flavouring chewing tobacco or salad dressing.

The U.S. is expected to produce 18million pounds of syrup this year, down from 30million pounds in 2011, according to a crop estimate report by Arthur Coombs of Bascom Maple Farms.

Mr Coombs's company, based in Alstead, New Hampshire, is one of the four largest maple processors in the U.S.

Mr Coombs said that, despite the shortfall, retail prices have risen by only 5 per cent this year.

He said this was because the Federation of Quebec Maple Producers has retained 38million pounds of syrup in reserve from a bumper crop in 2011.

Quebec produces about 80 per cent of the world's maple syrup.

Scientists said the average March temperature of 51.1F in the U.S. was 8.6 degrees above the 20th-century average for the month.
