The U.S. Patent Office has granted Apple a patent for what is believed to be the new dock connector on the next iPhone.

Apple is believed to be revamping the charging port for what will be the fifth version of the iPhone, which is expected to arrive later this Autumn.

As with all of Apple's products, the company keeps its cards very close to its chest before launches, but the patent filing describes a charging and data port which matches the rumoured new design.

Sadly for Apple users, the new design will mean changing all of your peripherals, such as speaker docks, unless adapters comes to market.

Change: This picture is believed to show a prototype case for the new iPhone (right), with its new connector design which is set to make every existing accessory completely obsolete

Old and new: The current iPhone is shown with the prototype of the iPhone 5's outer casing

Earlier this week Apple.pro printed these images of what they claim is the fascia of the next iPhone, suggesting the screen is much larger

The new port looks similar to micro USB, the standard supported by all other phone manufacturers - however it is very unlikely that Apple will support this standard, despite moves by the EU to get all phone companies to rally around one type of cable.

Apple's version has a triangle-shaped wedge at one end, which should stop users plugging in the cable the wrong way round.

Mac fans may spot a superficial similarity to a Firewire port, which is used to transfer raw video footage and larger files at high speed.

The patent office granted the patent for: 'A power adapter for a peripheral device such as portable electronics device.

'The power adapter includes a housing that contains electrical components associated with the power adapter.

'The power adapter also includes a data port provided at a surface of the housing. The data port is configured to provide external power to the peripheral device.'

Popular: But iPhone users could found themselves seriously out of pocket if they want to upgrade their device

The rumoured proposal has sparked 
alarm among the company’s followers  who fear they will have to buy new 
equipment to work with the phone.

Docking stations, which play music 
stored on iPhones and can cost hundreds of pounds, may become redundant 
as will chargers. All iPhones made so far use a 30-pin connector both 
for power and to plug in accessories.

Useless: The $850 Bang & Olufsen BeoSound 8 is designed to work with the current iPhone's design

Obsolete: The B&W Zeppelin speaker, left, and the Bose Sounddock 10, right, are other pricey gadgets which will have to be upgraded before they will work with the iPhone 5

Apple advertised for staff to work on 
the new connector earlier this year. It was seeking an engineer 
‘responsible for identifying appropriate connection technology 
requirements for new products and follow through with selection and 
development of suitable interconnect products’.

The advertisement added: ‘This will often involve adaptation of existing connectors or complete new designs.’

The new model is expected to have a 
larger 4-inch screen that will reputedly offer better resolution viewing
than a high definition TV.

It will include Apple’s new mapping 
software, which has sparked privacy fears as it uses aerial photography 
capable of showing detail just four inches across.
