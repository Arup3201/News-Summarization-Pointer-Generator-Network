It's not often that you see hardened criminals applying lashings of make-up or enjoying a spot of group meditation while lying on the floor.

But a program taking place at Californian prisons is encouraging inmates to do just that. Prisoners at the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco took part in the acting workshop 'Commedia Dell'Arte', designed to aid their rehabilitation.

The Actors' Gang Prison Project program, which runs the 8-week workshops, believes that through acting convicted criminals can learn develop empathy and start expressing themselves in a positive manner.

The program is led by actor and activist Tim Robbins, who is most famous for his starring role in American prison epic The Shawshank Redemption.

Workshop organizers feel that acting can help rehabilitate inmates by helping them explore their emotions and learn social skills that with aid their return to society.

They believe that, ultimately, the workshops can reduce re-offending rates and help ease the pressure of overcrowding on the California prison system.

At least three times a year, the theater company brings classes directly into prisons, working to foster 'tolerance and nonviolent expression while significantly reducing recidivism rates'.

The program began in 2006, when Robbins was approached by Sabra Williams, now the director of the Prison Project, about beginning an arts rehabilitation program.

Robbins told Variety magazine that he immediately realized the idea had the potential to change lives.

'My first thought was that it was exactly the kind of work we should be doing,' he said. 'I've worked for years with many different causes â€¦ but to actually be on the ground and doing the work is really fulfilling.'

The project brings together inmates from different races - and even different gangs - through classes that combine open discussion, theater education and performance.

'It creates a bond that is quite profound and lasting,' Robbins added. 'And it cuts deeper than previous lines that have been drawn.'

This year, the Prison Project was awarded state funding by the California Arts Council, which will help Robbins and his team expand their work.

'Our hope is that within five years we'll be able to train different groups throughout the state in this method,' he told Variety, 'And hopefully empower other organizations, too, to go in and do this work.'
