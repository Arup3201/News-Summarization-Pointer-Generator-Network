Camera-shy pop star Sia Furler enlisted Kristen Wiig and Dance Moms star Maddie Ziegler for her Chandelier performance at Sunday's Grammy Awards.

The 41-year-old Oscar nominee seemed an offbeat choice of avatar for the Australian 39-year-old, who kept her back turned to the crowd.

The SNL veteran donned her signature platinum blonde fringed wig with an unflattering, tear-away jumpsuit for the interpretive dance.

Wiigging out! Camera-shy pop star Sia Furler (M) enlisted Kristen Wiig (L) and Dance Moms star Maddie Ziegler (R) for her Chandelier performance at Sunday's Grammy Awards

Kristen wildly girated in a set resembling a broken-down apartment featuring an overturned mattress and a light bulb-riddled ceiling.

Later, the similarly-clad 12-year-old joined the Skeleton Twins actress in a whirling dervish through the cluttered stage.

It didn't take long for both ladies to wind up in the prominently featured nude leotard tugging at each other viciously.

'I'm gonna swing from the chandelier!' Kristen wildly girated in a set resembling a broken-down apartment featuring an overturned mattress and a light bulb-riddled ceiling

'1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 drink': Later, the similarly-clad 12-year-old joined the Skeleton Twins actress in a whirling dervish through the cluttered stage

Double take: It didn't take long for both ladies to wind up in the prominently featured nude leotard tugging at each other viciously and animatedly

Art imitating life: Much of the imagery and movements during the performance related to Sia's real-life struggle with alcoholism

Cathartic: The Pittsburgh-born prodigy showed off her impressive handsprings and split leaps during the vibrant performance choreographed by Ryan Heffington

Interpretive: Furler lurked in the background, belting the emotional song as Kristen catched Maddie in a climactic moment

Still strange? Wiig embraced Ziegler in a similar fashion as Shia LaBeouf in Sia's cage-set video for Elastic Heart

Wiig caught then embraced Ziegler in a similar fashion as Shia LaBeouf in Sia's cage-set video for Elastic Heart.

The Big Girls Cry belter was forced to apologise to fans after 'pedophelic' imagery of the 28-year-old actor dancing with the young reality star from the video offended them.

LaBeouf was also there, introducing Furler by reading a cryptic letter from 'Erik' - likely her filmmaker husband Erik Anders Lang.  

Daring dance: Sia was forced to apologise to fans after 'pedophelic' imagery of the 28-year-old actor dancing with the young reality star from the video offended them

'I love you so. Punch me if I stop crying': LaBeouf was also there, introducing Furler by reading a cryptic letter from 'Erik' - likely her filmmaker husband Erik Anders Lang

The 'metamodernist' Fury actor read: 'For Sia, I feel like this may be strange to say this here. I love you so. Punch me if I stop crying. I raise the white flag for you defeated, finally. If strength were made of broken pieces, you and I would always win.

'It is though and buildings and statues wink at us. I could squeeze you to zero. I'll never know another "What am I going to do?" Punch me if I stop crying and I'll do the same. Love, Erik. Ladies and gentlemen, Sia.'

Her song Chandelier - which won best choreography at the MTV Video Music Awards - was nominated for four Grammys but lost in all categories.

Another funnywoman: Last June, Girls creator and star Lena Dunham - posing with choreographer Ryan Heffington - filled in for Sia's appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers

'It's horrible I just wanted to have a private life': The elusive hitmaker (R) - who favours Maddie as her avatar - also refused to face the camera on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in May

Last June, Girls creator and star Lena Dunham filled in for Sia's appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers.

'It's horrible,' she lamented to the New York Times.

'I just wanted to have a private life. Once, as my friend was telling me they had cancer, someone came up and asked, in the middle of the conversation, if they could take a photograph with me.'  

Don't look at me! Before the ceremony, the elusive hitmaker hid her eyes beneath a massive wig alongside her mini-me Maddie outside the Staples Center

Caped crusader! The lookalikes rocked matching hand markings and black Armani suits for the red carpet

Pin parade: However, Sia had no trouble smiling for the cameras alongside Lang (R) backstage following the performance while clad in an ultra-short shirt dress

Before the ceremony, the elusive hitmaker hid her eyes beneath a massive wig alongside her mini-me Maddie outside the Staples Center.

The lookalikes rocked matching hand markings and black Armani suits for the red carpet.

However, Sia had no trouble smiling for the cameras alongside Lang backstage following the performance while clad in an ultra-short shirt dress.

Maddie - born Madison - can currently be seen in the fifth season of Dance Moms, which airs Tuesdays on Lifetime.

Big grin! Ziegler opted for comfy Adidas slides and a grey marbled jacket while cooling her heels backstage
