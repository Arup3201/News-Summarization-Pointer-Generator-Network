A young girl has been left in tears after being told she cannot join friends at their new secondary school - even though she can see it from her bedroom window.

Shannon Gunning, 11, of Bexley, south east London, was looking forward to the short walk to Haberdashers' Aske's Crayford Academy when she starts high school in September.

But instead her local education authority have given her a place at Erith School which is over three miles and two bus journeys away.

Kerry Joyce and Paul Gunning, and their daughter Shannon Gunning, were devastated when she was refused a place at the school

Just five of her primary school classmates are going to the same school while most of her friends - who all live further away than her - will be going to Haberdashers'.

Shannon and her angry parents Paul Gunning, 49, and Kerry Joyce, 43, say they have been given no explanation for the decision.

Shannon, of Crayford, south east London, said: 'I don't understand, it's so not fair.

'It isn't fair that my friends can go to the school next door to my house but I have to go to a school miles away.

'I don't understand. I just want to go to school with my friends.

'High school is scary enough without having nobody you know there.'

Paul, a utility supervisor, said: 'Kerry has lived in this house her entire life, and one of the reasons we've stayed here is because it was so close to a good school.

'For the council to turn round and tell us that Shannon will have to go to a school miles away from her house is ridiculous

'There's a perfectly good school around the corner - it's literally a stone's throw away.

'It seems so ridiculous that my daughter cannot go to the school she can see from her own window.'

He added: 'If she was forced to go to Erith School my partner Kerry would have to take her for the first year and because she doesn't drive the bus would cost about £800 for a year.

'Kerry would also have to give up work in the mornings because she wouldn't be able to fulfil her duties as a carer in our local area.'

A Haberdashers' Aske's Crayford Academy spokesman said: 'We are very sorry to hear that Miss Gunning did not receive a place at our school.

'We know that finding the right school for a child is very important and that this is a stressful time for parents.

Shannon Gunning has been offered a place at Erith School, in Bexley, but she will only be joined by a few of her friends

'We cannot comment on individual cases, nor on the admissions policies of other schools in the London Borough of Bexley.

'Haberdashers' Aske's Crayford Academy is heavily oversubscribed and we are scrupulous in following a fair admissions policy, which is available on our website.'

The school added that they have nine children applying for every one place.

The family are appealing against the decision.
