A man trying to hide child pornography from his wife was turned in by the computer technician he hired to delete it.

James Rivers, from Kent, Washington, told the technician he wanted the content wiped from his MacBook Pro so his wife 'did not divorce him.' 

But the technician was so disturbed by what he allegedly saw on the computer he contacted the FBI.

Rivers, an audio engineer, has been charged with sexual exploitation of a minor.

The 57-year-old 'went to great lengths to destroy evidence of his exploitation and possession of depictions of images of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct,' Senior Deputy Prosecutor Cecelia Gregson said in charging papers. 

The technician told police he had been told not to view the photos 'under any circumstances,' but he did and that is when he found the two deeply disturbing videos .

According to charging papers, both showed Rivers setting up a camera that then recorded a young girl using the bathroom. 

Rivers' wife told investigators she had a 'gut feeling that something was not right,' the detective said in court papers, reports SeattlePi.

During a fight four days before, she threatened to have his computer searched for child pornography, according to charging papers.

Police contend Rivers admitted to making the recordings and he also admitted to sexually assaulting a child.

'He maintained that he was on medication and had drunk wine, causing him to black out during the incident,' the detective said in charging papers. 

He was released from jail after posting bond on a $300,000 bail. 

Rivers has toured with rock groups as well teaching audio classes at the Art Institute of Seattle for more than 26 years, according to his LinkedIn page.

Drew Newman, a student at the Arts Institute of Seattle said Rivers was a quiet teacher.

'Instead of, this is how you do it from the book's perspective, he would tell us about his experiences, where he's been,' Newman told KIRO 7.

Newman was surprised to hear about Rivers' arrest but said, 'We don't know the whole story.'
