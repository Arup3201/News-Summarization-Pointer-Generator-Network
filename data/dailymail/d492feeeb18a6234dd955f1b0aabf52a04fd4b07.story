An Indian man allegedly kidnapped and burned three of his brothers’ young daughters to death as he was jealous of them being married while he was still single, family members said.

The charred bodies of Akshaya, 9, Suri, 6, and Khushi, 4, were found near an engineering college not far from Nizamabad town, Andhra Pradesh, where their families had attended a wedding on Wednesday.

A bottle of petrol was found by police nearby.

‘It is a clear case of murder,’ said Nizamabad District Superintendent of Police Tarun Joshi.

The girls went missing in the afternoon and at 10.30pm alarmed family members received a phone call from their uncle, Narendra Reddy, 37, who told them he was 25 miles away in a town called Basser and ready to kill himself.

He had lured the girls away with chocolates, according to The Times of India, and told relatives that he was depressed about not being married, like his brothers.

The macabre scene was found after family members had made frantic calls to the police.

Reddy’s whereabouts are unknown but his watch and slippers have been found near a bridge, according to NDTV.com.

Superintendent Joshi said that if Reddy did commit the crime, the motive isn’t totally clear.

Shocked family members said no one had fallen out with him but speculated that jealousy of his brothers may have been a factor.

The girls were the granddaughters of Raghupati Reddy, the leader of a local farming community.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
