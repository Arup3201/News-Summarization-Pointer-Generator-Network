Manchester City 

Captain Vincent Kompany has been ruled out of the champions'  Premier League trip to QPR on Saturday with a calf injury.

The defender took a blow to the leg in the midweek Champions League loss to CSKA Moscow. The problem is not thought serious but it could put Kompany's participation in Belgium's upcoming Euro 2016 qualifier with Wales in doubt.

Former England midfielder Frank Lampard has recovered from a thigh injury but playmaker David Silva (knee) and left-back Aleksandar Kolarov (calf) are out.

Provisional squad: Hart, Caballero, Zabaleta, Sagna, Clichy, Demichelis, Mangala, Boyata, Nasri, Navas, Milner, Toure, Lampard, Fernando, Fernandinho, Aguero, Jovetic, Dzeko.
