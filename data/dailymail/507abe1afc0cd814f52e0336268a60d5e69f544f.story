A teenage girl chopped her father's head clean off with a bush knife after he raped her in their home in the highlands of Papua New Guinea.

Now residents of the village have formed a protective ring around the 18-year-old, refusing to hand her over to the police because they agreed her 'evil' father deserved to die.

A local church leader, Pastor Lucas Kumi from the village of Rang in the Western Highlands, said the entire community would refuse to allow the girl to be subjected to any official investigation.

'The people and 
leaders in our area went and saw the headless body of the father after 
the girl reported the incident to them and explained why she had killed 
her father,' said Pastor Kumi.

He told the Post 
Courier newspaper that the father, in his mid-40s, raped his daughter 
when they were alone in their house after the mother and two other 
children from the family went to visit relatives for the night.

'The father went to his daughter's room in the night and raped her repeatedly.

'The father wanted to 
rape his daughter again in the morning and that was when the young girl 
picked up the bush knife and chopped her father's head off,' said Pastor
 Kumi.

'We've all agreed that she is free to stay in the community because the father deserved to die.

'The daughter did what
 she did because of the trauma and the evil actions of her father, so 
that is why we have all agreed that she remains in the community.'

He said a ring of 
protection had been placed around the girl, who will be kept away from 
any official investigation.

Death penalty: the government of Papua New Guinea has brought back the death penalty in order to combat serious crimes

'The community have also agreed not to conduct any formal burial service for the father.'

Crimes of rape, 
murder, suspected witch killings and prostitution are rife throughout 
Papua New Guinea and as a desperate attempt to stop the lawlessness the 
government recently re-introduced the death penalty for serious 
offences.

But at the weekend the
 Post Courier reported the results of an investigation into child 
prostitution, a report, it said, that will 'make you cringe.'

Children aged between 
13 and 16, said the paper, were selling sex in the nightclubs of the 
capital, Port Moresby, five premises being reported to be engaged in the
 under-age prostitution trade.

Three non-government 
organisations have produced a report based on interviews with no less 
than 175 child sex workers.

'It's true - our 
girls, and especial school girls, are being bought and sold for sex,' 
said one of the investigators.
