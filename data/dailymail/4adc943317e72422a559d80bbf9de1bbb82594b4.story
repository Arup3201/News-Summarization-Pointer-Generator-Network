The badly decomposed bodies of two identical twins were found sitting in recliners in their living room in Chattanooga, Tennessee, over the weekend.

Investigators believe Andrew and Anthony Johnson, 63, died in early 2011 based on the state of their remains.

Both men were severe diabetics and police said there were no obvious signs of trauma or foul play. Investigators have established the date of death based on the time stamp found on a receipt near unused cans of Coke.

The badly decomposed bodies of two identical twins Andrew and Anthony Johnson, 63, were found sitting in recliners in their living room in Chattanooga, Tennessee, over the weekend

The discovery has shocked neighbors who didnâ€™t think anything was wrong because the grass was regularly cut and the mailbox wasn't overflowing.

The twins were known to live a hermit lifestyle and did not communicate regularly either with family or anyone else, reports WRCB.  

A sister of the twins had tried to check on them in August 2011, but didn't have a key. She had called police and they found that the residence appeared to be vacant. 

A letter from the Post Office was found in the mailbox stating that they believed the residence to be vacant and to cease delivery of mail to the address. 

On Saturday family members called police after finding a key to the residence and officers found deceased inside

Officers also discovered in 2011 that there were no signs of forced entry to the residence, no foul odors, no signs of foul play or suspicious activity, and no visible/evident reason to allow forced entry to the residence. 

At that time, family members indicated that they would not have been surprised if the brothers had moved without telling anyone. 

On Saturday family members called police after finding a key to the residence. Officers were given the key and found deceased inside the residence.

The twins' family has declined to comment.
