James Holmes, the Colorado theater shooting suspect submitted a bizarre picture of himself with a lama as part of his application to the University of Illinois Neuroscience program.

Despite glowing references praising his 'intellectual and emotional maturity', Holmes chose to attach a photograph which shows him wearing wrap-around sunglasses pointing at a lama which seems to be in the same room.

The letter, photograph and all the university's documents related to 
Holmes were provided to The Associated Press on Friday after an open records 
request. The News-Gazette in Champaign, Illinois, first obtained the documents.

Holmes declined to attend the highly selective program, and 
instead attended the University of Colorado, Denver, studying neuroscience until 
he dropped out in June. He gave no reason for declining the offer of admission 
in Illinois, and no reason for dropping out in Colorado.

University of Colorado officials have declined to release 
Holmes' records, citing a Colorado judge's gag order that does not apply to 
other states.

Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 in 
the attack during a midnight showing of the new Batman movie. Holmes attorneys 
say that he is mentally ill.

Letters, his resume and a personal statement written by 
Holmes paint a picture a bright student who is committed to pursuing a career in cognitive neuroscience.

'Researching learning and memory interests me because these 
are the very cognitive processes which enable us to acquire information and 
retain it,' he wrote in his personal statement. 'They are at the core of what 
distinguishes us as people.'

In recommendation letters, Holmes is described as being in 
the top 1 per cent of his honors classes with a cumulative grade point average of 
3.949, making honors list.

'He takes an active role in his education, and brings a 
great amount of intellectual and emotional maturity into the classroom,' one 
recommendation letter reads. 'James received excellent evaluations from the 
professor's and graduate students with whom he worked and was mentored.'

Another letter describes him as 'a very effective group 
leader' on assignments.

That description is a stark contrast to his demeanor in 
court, where he seems dazed, looking straight ahead and avoiding eye contact 
with those sitting in the court room.

As part of his application, Holmes submitted a picture of 
himself standing next to a llama.

'Your personal and professional qualities are truly 
outstanding'

'Your personal and professional qualities are truly 
outstanding,' and 'you will be an excellent match for our program,' read Holmes' 
letter accepting him into the program after paying his travel expenses for a 
visit.

At least two researchers were vying for Holmes to join their 
laboratories, and the school offered him a stipend $22,600 per year and free 
tuition.

Holmes sent an email to the school declining their 
offer.

'My apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused,' 
he wrote. 'Best wishes in your candidate search.'
