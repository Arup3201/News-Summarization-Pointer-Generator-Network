He's famous for being really, really ridiculously good looking but Britain's  answer to Zoolander, insists he's nothing like the airheaded movie character.

In fact, there's far more to top male model David Gandy, 35, than posing in pants - he's going into business as a shoe brand owner.

And competition with fellow Essex boy, David Beckham, drives him every step of the way, he revealed in a new interview with Red Magazine.

Britain's top male model David Gandy doesn't want to be seen as a 'brainless idiot' any more

David recently bought luxury footwear brand David Preston in a bid to be taken seriously.

He said: 'Models are as popular as bankers! You're seen as a brainless idiot – paid a fortune to do very little. I don't want to just be known as the man in the pants.'

Yet he jokes that whatever he chooses to do, Becks follows soon after.

'Well, I did the white pants in 2006, and then he did Armani. I became an ambassador for whisky, and now he has his whisky brand,' he said. 

'I don't think we're in competition, though, and hopefully people should be proud there are two Essex guys taking on the world, promoting Britishness.'

As an ambitious entrepreneur, Gandy is determined to revitalise homegrown businesses and concerns.

He said: 'We're terrible at investing in our own companies. It upsets me that half the companies on Savile Row aren't British-owned. 

'When I see a small British company I believe in, I'm in the privileged position to give it a chance. London is an extraordinary place to be, and we should be proud of our great brands. 

'I'm proud to have stuck here. I belong to England.'

And while pop idols such as Harry Styles and Justin Bieber may have most girls' attention, David, who's reunited with Saturdays singer Mollie King, is proud to be seen as a grown man.  

'We've become so obsessed by boys. There's almost a backlash against true men. Where are the Paul Newmans or Steve McQueens of the world?'

The muscled adonis recently showcased his enviable physique in his range of underwear for M&S, but he offers words of comfort to the average man.  

'Of course [I have fat days!] I work hard at it. At the gym there are people with all the gear and no idea, and then people in scruffy tracksuit bottoms working hard. That's me at the end of the day.'
