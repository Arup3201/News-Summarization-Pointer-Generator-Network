After a month of excess comes the time for abstinence. 

But quitting the drink doesn’t mean just sticking to boring water or bottled juices. 

From mocktails with spiced syrups to softails with exotic juices, there is a plethora of non-alcoholic options for those planning to abstain this month.  

Mixologists have started experimenting with syrups and spices to add depth of flavour to mocktails

Cocktail bars, keen to tap in to a growing customer base of non-drinkers, now offer non-alcoholic versions of classic cocktails. 

Canny mixologists have started experimenting with syrups, juices and even spices to add much-needed depth of flavour to mocktails and softails.

Cinnamon, cloves and even Japanese spice powder feature in these clever concoctions, transforming regular flavours into extraordinary sensations. 

And while non-alcoholic beers aren't new (Becks, Erdinger, Bavaria and Kirin all have alcohol-free versions of their beer), ciders are now coming in booze-free versions, too. 

Kopparberg is the latest brand to jump on the wagon and have produced alcohol-free strawberry and lime, pear, and mixed fruit ciders. 

The UK is also home to a number of non-alcoholic bars, from London's Redemption in Red Lion Street to Nottingham's Sobar in Friar Lane and Liverpool's The Brink, making it easier than ever to have a successful Dry January.
