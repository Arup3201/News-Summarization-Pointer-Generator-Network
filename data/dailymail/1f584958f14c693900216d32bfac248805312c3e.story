England arrived in the most isolated city in the world on Saturday to find a familiar face waiting and ready to put on a show for them in front of a sell-out WACA crowd.

Kevin Pietersen has been like Banquo’s ghost at England’s feast ever since they sacked him and on Sunday he will have the perfect opportunity to show them what they are missing when he plays in the Big Bash semi-final.

A number of England players are expected to watch Pietersen’s Melbourne Stars take on a Perth Scorchers side including Michael Carberry in a last-four contest in the massively successful Australian Twenty20 competition.

A delicious irony has brought the man who has haunted England’s progress all year to Perth at the same time as his former team-mates, who will face India here in a Tri-series match on Friday which they need to win to make Sunday’s final.

Pietersen has made a big impact in the Big Bash — causing problems for England along the way by saying that Eoin Morgan would love him in his side — and has charmed an Australian audience who, without the benefit of the full facts, find it hard to see how England can ignore such an extravagant talent.

A relaxed Pietersen talked on Saturday of his enthusiasm for an Australian franchise competition that has shown the way forward for an English Twenty20 game that has been left lagging behind.

‘I’ve absolutely loved it,’ said Pietersen of his time in Melbourne. ‘What I’ve loved is how competitive the cricket is, which is what I’m sure you expect when you come to Australia.

‘The way the tournament is run, the time between the games, living in Melbourne playing for a brilliant franchise and just having such a good bunch of guys. The coach and management have been sensational and everybody has been treated exactly the same. We’ve had just the best time.’

There was clearly a message to England in there somewhere. As there was, too, when Pietersen was asked if England could learn from the Big Bash, which on Saturday saw a crowd in excess of 52,000 at the Adelaide Oval for Sydney’s semi-final victory over the home side.

‘I think so,’ said Pietersen, without a county in England since his release by Surrey. ‘They can learn because the franchise system does work. Everybody has made it work. I think playing once a week doesn’t work in the UK , especially if you want to get good players in the teams. I tried it last year and found it very hard playing once a week.’

Pietersen struggled for form in the wake of his exile from England for both Surrey and Delhi in the Indian Premier League but he has been much more like his old self in scoring three half centuries for Melbourne.

‘When you play more you can practise more and be part of a team environment. And your eyes are consistently picking length. With batting it makes a huge difference. And my knee — my knee was horrendous for the last 18 months.’

Pietersen now has to decide whether he wants to be anything more than a Twenty20 mercenary. ‘I need to seriously figure out what I’m going to do,’ he admitted.

But whether he has a future in an English county system where the salary cap has just been reduced remains to be seen. Pietersen does not approve of the cost-cutting measures that emerged last week.

‘What’s frustrating is they say they want to help home-grown players,’ he said ‘But the best way to make them become better is to play against better players. Find a way to franchise county cricket. You would have 10 counties or franchises who play each other in Twenty20 or one-day cricket.

Pietersen says English cricket need to find a way to franchise county cricket, labelling players 'muppets'

‘All the muppets who are on £18 grand, £15 grand, either you become better or you go and do something else. The best players would play against each other week in week out. That’s how you become better. You don’t do that by reducing salary caps.’

Perhaps not surprisingly for a man who no longer plays the ultimate form of the game, Pietersen expressed concerns about the future of Test cricket.

‘The last couple of months have been the first time I’ve started to worry about Test cricket,’ he said after Melbourne’s last practice session ahead of Sunday’s match. ‘Kids have got no interest in Test cricket. Look at how they are filling these stadiums for Big Bash cricket. They are all kids and you speak to them at the end of a game and you say “would you come to a Test match?” And they say “no”! None of the kids want to block. They want to switch-hit, they want to hit over extra cover, they want to slog a six first ball. It’s sad but that’s the way of the world.’
