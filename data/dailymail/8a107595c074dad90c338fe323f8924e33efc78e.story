A leading UKIP politician has been forced to deny that he played Bungle in Seventies kids’ show Rainbow after hoaxers hacked his Wikipedia page.

Paul Nuttall, deputy leader of UKIP, found his Wikipedia page edited by pranksters to say: ‘Nuttall was the original Bungle in children’s television show Rainbow.’

The North West MEP, from Bootle, Merseyside, said: ‘I think this is probably the funniest thing I’ve ever read about myself on the internet. I’m all for it.’

North West MEP Nuttall has described the hacking incident as 'probably the funniest thing I’ve ever read about myself on the internet’

But the politician denied the rumours, saying: ‘Considering I wasn’t even born when Rainbow started, it makes it very difficult indeed for this to be true.

‘But I do find it really funny that people are making things like this up.’

Mr Nuttall was born in 1976 - four years after Rainbow first hit the airwaves.

The pranksters’ identities and motives are not known.

Lovable brown bear Bungle was actually played by actors John Leeson, Stanley Bates, Malcolm Lord and Paul Cullinan over the years.

More than 1,000 episodes of Rainbow were made between 1972 and 1992. The show was dubbed Britain’s answer to hit US series Sesame Street.

Rainbow’s other characters included Zippy and George.

Before going into politics, Mr Nuttall taught history at Hugh Baird College and Liverpool Hope University.

Bungle, second from left, was a regular member of long-running children's favourite Rainbow, which ran from 1972 until 1992
