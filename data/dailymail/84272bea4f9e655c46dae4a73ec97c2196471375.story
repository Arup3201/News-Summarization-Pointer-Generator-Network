A mother reportedly claims that she has been cut off from her son after agreeing to an open adoption with a wealthy couple.

Nina Yusupov, 32, from Brooklyn, New York, claimed to have been living on the breadline after going through a divorce in 2008 and struggling with depression when she gave up her son. 

She placed her son Eliyahu in a big brother/sister program where he began spending time with David and Jennifer Bergenfeld on weekends, The New York Post reported.

The couple live in a luxury apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, according to The Post.

Mr Bergenfeld, 42, is an associate at the law firm D’Amato & Lynch. His 45-year-old wife acts as a lawyer for Global Bank. 

The Bergenfelds wanted to adopt Eliyahu but allow his birth mother to stay in his life with visits twice a month, phone calls and letters, according to court records quoted by The Post.

Ms Yusupov claimed to The Post that she signed a document agreeing to this but the Bergenfelds allegedly never filed the agreement in court and stopped her from seeing her son three years ago.

The Bergenfelds won an order of protection against Ms Yusupov in 2010 after she allegedly tried to kidnap him. 

The Bergenfelds declined to comment to MailOnline today. 

Ms Yusupov, who says on social media that she is in a relationship, now claims she is suing to force the open-adoption agreement and gain access to her son with attorney, Steven Feinman.

Mr Feinman refused to comment to MailOnline on Tuesday.

Ms Yusupov told The New York Post this week: 'I feel like I'm lost. I imagine he’s thinking, ''Why is my mother not coming to see me? 

'On May 11 of this year, Ms Yusupov posted a picture of her son and his younger brother Moshe, now aged eight. 

She wrote: 'Eli I wish you were here with me. Mom missis u a million. Love u all ways .'

In another picture, she commented: 'This is me & my dearest son eli . Eli me & Ur brother Moshe miss & love you very much.'
