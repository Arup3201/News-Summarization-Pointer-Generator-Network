Argentine president Cristina Kirchner was left red-faced last night after it emerged the star of her controversial Falklands ad is set to miss the Olympics.

Hockey player Fernando Zylberberg flew to the islands and worked out on a British war memorial ahead of the London games with the boast : "To compete on English soil, we are training on Argentine soil."

The Argentine government ignored 
international criticism to screen the ad repeatedly and use it to launch
vitriolic attacks on Britain.

Controversial: President Christina Kirchner (L) is now facing having to take down the much debated ad which features field hockey player Fernando Zylberberg (R) working out on the Falklands islands' Great War Memorial

But their outspoken president was put on the back foot today/yesterday (WED) after it emerged Zylberberg has been left out of a pre-Olympics hockey tournament and will almost certainly be passed over for London.

The ad starring him, condemned as 'tawdry and cowardly' by Falklands survivor Simon Weston, was last night expected to be dropped from Argentine TV screens.

A source close to the ad agency behind the video admitted: "Fernando missing the Olympics would be a bit of an embarrassment.

'He was picked because we thought he'd be a dead cert for the event.

'I suspect the ad will be quietly dropped now.

'It's difficult to see how you can make propaganda based on an Olympian training on disputed territory when it turns out he's not going to go to the Olympics.'

Another added: 'Everyone involved in the project feels pretty silly at the moment.

'What was trumpeted as a kick in the teeth for Britain has turned out to be a spectacular own goal.

'There's a little-bit of wound licking going on at the moment.

'Cristina Kirchner never envisaged for one moment when she was making political capital out of the video that Fernando would be left out of the Olympics.'

Zylberberg, expected to make the cut 
for what would have been his third Olympics, has been virtually ruled 
out after being excluded from the 18-man Argentine hockey squad taking 
part in a 10-day tournament in Malaysia from May 24.

His surprise exclusion comes after he received threats on social networking sites for starring in the Falklands ad.

The 34-year-old failed to attend a reception at the British Embassy in Buenos Aires last night/on Tuesday night.

Opening scene: After a caption reading 'Islas Malvinas', the Argentinian name for the Falkand Islands, hockey player Zylberberg is seen stepping out early in the morning for a run

Obvious landmarks: As the advert progresses, Zylberberg can be seen limbering up outside the Globe Tavern, a popular pub in Port Stanley

Passing ALL the sights: As rousing music reaches its eventual peak, Zylberberg jogs past the office of the Penguin News, which today ran quotes from Falkland Islander Ian Hansen criticising the advert

Several teammates accepted the invitation to the event, hosted by British ambassador to Argentina Shan Morgan.

Zylberberg's absence from Malaysia - and his expected absence from London - has been attributed to 'sporting reasons.'

But
it is bound to lead to speculation he has been dropped from the squad 
because of fears his presence at the Olympics could cause his teammates 
problems.

One critic wrote 
on Twitter after the Falklands ad was first screened: 'I'm tempted to 
find out when the Argentine hockey team is due to arrive in the UK so I 
can throw eggs at Zylberberg.'

Another
promised to jeer him when he played and dozens called for him to put on
the first plane back to Buenos Aires when he flew in for the Games.

Zylberberg
was one of three Argentine athletes who filmed the ad in secret after 
flying to the Falklands under the pretext they were running a marathon.

He
enraged locals and Falklands war veterans after it emerged he did 
step-ups on the islands' Great War Memorial honouring British sailors 
who died battling the German fleet in 1914.

He
was also filmed running past the office of Falklands newspaper Penguin 
News and doing arm-raises outside Port Stanley's Globe Tavern.

Iconic British phone box: There's little doubt over why the advert's makers included this shot in the mix

The
Argentine office of ad agency Young and Rubicam sold it to Christina 
Kirchner's office for an undisclosed sum after gifting her a copy.

It
was first screened on Argentine TV stations last Wednesday night, the 
30th anniversary of the sinking of Argentine warship General Belgrano 
during the Falklands conflict.

Sir
Martin Sorrell, chief exec of advertising giant WPP which owns Young 
and Rubicam, later condemned the ad as "totally unacceptable."

And
Britain's Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond demanded the Argentine 
government apologise for sullying the Olympics ideal with the ad.

Argentina's
Foreign Secretary Hector Timerman responded by accusing Britain of 
killing and maiming innocent civilians in a vitriolic rant at the 
weekend.

And on Monday Cristina Kirchner defended the ad, insisting it reflected Argentine feelings.

Gerardo
Werthein, President of the Argentine Olympics Committee, last night 
sought to assuage fears his athletes would use the London Games to 
promote the Falklands cause.

He
said: "The Argentine Olympics Committee wants to make it clear that 
using the Olympic Games to carry out political gestures of any kind is 
unacceptable.

'We will behave with the correct Olympian spirit in everything we do in London and anywhere else.'

Evocative and provocative: A close-up shot shows a hand, supposedly Zylberberg's, meaningfully rolling sand through its fingers

Pointed message: With the rugged countryside in the background: 'To compete on English soil'

Dramatic pause: The most incendiary comment reads: 'We are training on Argentine soil'

Final say: The screen fades to white with the message: 'Tribute to the fallen and ex-combatants'
