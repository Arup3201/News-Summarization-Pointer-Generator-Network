Radamel Falcao's miserable time at Manchester United plumbed new depths when he turned out for the club's Under 21s in their 1-1 draw with Tottenham.

At a virtually empty Old Trafford the £280,00-a-week misfit endured a lifeless 72 minutes before suffering the ignominy of hearing cheers when his number was held up.

United handed Monaco a £6m loan fee for Falcao, 29, and have an option to buy him for £43.2m at the end of the season.

It could have been a win for Manchester United on Tuesday night, had Falcao not found his way in front of two goalbound shots. The expensive loanee did more harm than good to United's attack.

One big positive for the home side though was Rafael. His all-round performance and excellent goal will surely give Louis van Gaal food for thought with regards to the left back slot.

Anyway, that's it from our live coverage. Check out Mike Keegan's match report HERE.

Thanks for following!

That's it, the referee has blown the final whistle and United and Spurs play out a 1-1 draw.

Kenny McEvoy scored the opener for Tottenham before Rafael equalised with a brilliant chip in the second half.

But despite an attack boasting Radamel Falcao and James Wilson, United couldn't find a winner and Spurs had the best chance of the second half when they hit the bar.

Liam Grimshaw heads Pereira's first corner wide via a deflection - a second comes in but it only ends with captain Tom Thorpe fouling the goalkeeper.

There will be three minutes of time added on.

Andy Kellet's brilliant back-heel sets up Pereira for a cross. His pin-point ball comes to the feet of Harrop but he hesitates in a way that resembled the man he replaced, Falcao.

When he finally got the shot off, the effort was blocked and the chance was gone. Still both teams going in search of a winner.

Meanwhile, Spurs make a sub. Lesniak is off for Aaron McEneff.

Axel Tuanzebe is on as United search for a winner.

Off comes Shaquile Coulthirst to be replaced by Daniel Akindiyini.

United arguably look better with Falcao off the pitch and James Wilson trusted with a more central role.

Rafael's cross from the right just evades the young striker sliding on and shortly after Pereira puts another Rafael delivery over the bar.

Falcao is being subbed off! He's been poor in truth and has done more harm than good to United's attacks.

Louis van Gaal is unlikely to be impressed and you would think he has no chance of starting at the weekend on this showing. He is replaced by Josh Harrop.

Oh, and he awkwardly didn't seem to realise it was him that was being hooked at first, just as he did with the first team against Preston North End.

It's fair to say the Old Trafford crowd weren't too impressed with him either:

Valdes comes out to scoop up the ball under the feet Shaquile Coulthirst but the Spurs make takes exception to his efforts and they have a bit of a shove at each other.

Nothing special too and they're both just warned by the referee.

Reece James comes off and surprise January signing on loan from Bolton, Andy Kellet, joins the action.

Brilliant work from Rafael down the right flank for United and he finds himself in acres of space and with loads of time to pick a pass to the onrushing Goss at the edge of the area.

He hits a low shot and it lands at the feet of Falcao but he can only find a slight deflection and it's easily saved. Again, it looked originally goalbound.

McEvoy again provides from the left, this time his cross goes all the way to the edge of the area and Will Miller, who pokes a shot towards goal but it's easily saved by Valdes.

A free-kick routine ends with McEvoy playing a short cross to Cameron Carter-Vickers at the near post and his glanced header hits the bar with Valdes nowhere near it.

Best chance of the half so far goes to Spurs.

Not too much happening here but Rafael is again looking the star of the show for United. Don't think we've seen Falcao touch the ball yet in the second period since he kicked us off.

Meanwhile, Christian Fuchs has just put Schalke ahead against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in the Champions League. It's 1-0 but that leaves Real still 2-1 ahead of aggregate. Keep up to date with our coverage HERE.

The Spurs forward makes a darting run forward through midfield with a couple of feints thrown in for good measure, but he's eventually tackled on the edge of the D.

Into the second half at Old Trafford. Falcao kicks the second period off from the centre spot.

That's it for the first half. Rafael equalised for United with an excellent chip after Kenny McEvoy opened the scoring for Spurs.

It's not been great from star man Radamel Falcao so far but he's putting himself about and you feel a better chance will come if he's not hooked at the break.

Coming up to half him and Andreas Pereira is the latest United player to have a pop from range. This time it's from 25 yards and it goes a few inches over McGee's head. He had the keeper worried.

One minute of added time is shown at Old Trafford.

A poor - and unnecessary - challenge sees the United youngster booked.

Rafael is showing himself as the best player on the pitch here and it's seems a little bizarre that his first-team prospects are in doubt under Van Gaal when you consider Antonio Valencia's recent form..

Spurs are producing some good passing play and at times Falcao is reduced to feeding off scraps in the air up against young defenders. Surely he couldn't have envisaged that when he arrived back in August.

Meanwhile, Sportsmail's Mike Keegan reports that the steadily growing crowd at Old Trafford are finding their voices after the goal.

Just when Spurs looked to be getting on top goalkeeper Luke McGee drops a bit of a clanger.

He collects the ball from a cross ahead of Falcao and looks to bowl it out to a team-mate.

Instead it hits Rafael and the Brazilian has all the time in the world to send a sumptuous chip back over the goalkeeper's head and into the net. Left-footed, and from 35 yards. Impressive. 1-1.

Awful pass out of the area from Donald Love for Manchester United and Shaquile Coulthirst latches on to a ball back in.

A brilliant bit of skill gets him away from his marker but a cheeky chipped finish past Valdes drops just wide. Close.

Shades of United's defeat on Monday night here....

Shocking back pass from Joe Rothwell and it arrives at the feet of Spurs' Kenny McEvoy. He advances forward past one challenger and slots in an excellent finish past Victor Valdes.

Ah, that's not so good from the on-loan forward. James Wilson makes an excellent run cutting in from the right wing and fires in a thunderous left-footed shot.

It looks to be going on target but instead the smashes into the back of Falcao and out of play. Whoops.

Joshua Onomah, a star of Spurs' FA Youth Cup semi-final first leg win over Chelsea last week, has a chance to put his side ahead after being played in over the top.

Unfortunately for the visitors he blasts over from a tight angle.

Another chance for Falcao, this time he teams up with Rafael again and is one-on-one with marker Bongani Khumalo but he can't break past him and the tackle dispossess him. Sean Goss follows up and fires narrowly wide from 20 yards.

The stands are filling up at Old Trafford a little more during the opening stages - it's not every night you get a £40million-rated star striker playing in a free-entry game.

Grant Ward's free-kick for Tottenham the only real dangerous opportunity so far.

Rafael is another United first-team player hoping to impress tonight and he bursts into the box down the right but a deep cross cannot be controlled by Falcao and Spurs clear.

The Colombian has been flagged offside once and at least seems willing to get himself about - this could be a positive evening for him.

Meanwhile a brilliant run from Grant Ward for Tottenham draws a foul and Spurs have a free-kick in a dangerous area, but it's sent well over the bar into an empty Stretford End.

Manchester United's expensive loanee has his first opportunity of the game, receiving the ball in off the right flank and trying to turn a marker inside the area.

The ball gets tangled under his feet though and the chance is gone.

Not the greatest start, but a start nonetheless.

The two teams are out, with Falcao at the back of the United line-up and we've kicked off.

Louis van Gaal's assistant manager Ryan Giggs is in attendance at Old Trafford tonight and is sitting alongside his former team-mate Nicky Butt.

If Falcao wants a place in the side to face Tottenham's first team this weekend then he'll have to show something to impress Giggs.

The two teams tonight sit joint top of the Barclays Under 21 Premier League (although Spurs have a game in hand), so tonight's result will decide who becomes the outright leader.

It might be United's only chance of silverware this season after their FA Cup exit on Monday night, which you can read Martin Samuel's match report for HERE.

United are expected to play a 4-1-2-1 diamond, with Falcao and Wilson leading the line, a pairing that has faced Yeovil and Cambridge United in the FA Cup this season.

And if you're wondering how United can field Falcao in this competition, here's a bit of context for you:
