Officials in Boston announced on Friday night that the city's security lockdown has been lifted but urged residents to exercise extreme caution since the second bombing suspect remains on the loose.

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said the city's mass transit service is resuming, after it was suspended for most of the day while police launched a manhunt for the surviving marathon bomb suspect, 19-year-old suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

The city's commuter rail service is expected to resume on Saturday.

'We can return to living our lives,' Gov. Patrick said at a press conference late Friday but urged Bostonians, 'to remain vigilant. If you are out, continue to be alert to suspicious activity.'

Lifted: Governor Deval Patrick said on Friday night that the security lockdown on the Boston area has been lifted even as the search continues for the second bombing suspect

Ghost town: Boston's normally busy streets were completely empty as the town was under strict lockdown orders

The Governor warned that 'there is still a very, very dangerous individual at large' and urged area residents to keep their eyes open for suspicious activity and unattended packages.

'The stay indoor request that has been in affect is lifted but remain vigilant,' he said.

Streets were deserted and the city was eerily quiet, as officials tried to keep citizens off the
 streets following the fatal shoot out in Watertown, Mass. early Friday morning
 that lead to the death of the first suspect, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26.

Law enforcement officials told Boston 
residents to remain indoors, shutting down the entire public 
transportation system, closing schools and ordering businesses to remain
 closed for the day.

Amtrak services in the area around 
Boston was suspended indefinitely, keeping people- including 
19-year-old suspect Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev from leaving the city.

'This is a serious situation, we're taking it seriously. We're asking the public to take it seriously as well,' Governor Deval Patrick said in a Friday morning briefing.

Megabus cancelled 18 buses and other bus companies including Bolt Bus, Greyhound, and Peter Pan-that were scheduled to travel between Boston and neighboring states, changing plans for more than 1,000 passengers.

Closed campus: All public schools and more than 16 colleges in the area were part of the lockdown

Nowhere to turn: Police have been going through the second suspect's reported neighborhood door-by-door, but the lockdown was extended to all of Boston (downtown pictured here)

Off the roads: The entire city was eerily quiet during the lockdown, that remained for most of Friday

Looming: Residents anxiously awaited a conclusion of the manhunt so they could go outside

Unusual sight: More than a million people were told to stay in their homes and not go to work

Helpful: The Governor said the 'shelter in place' order was used so police could quickly mobilize and track the suspect

Flights into Boston's Logan Airport were permitted to land during the day but passengers were limited in their transportation options from the airport.

All public schools and 16 of the city's colleges were closed for the day.

A
 late addition to the list of closed universities was UMass-Dartmouth, 
after school officials realized that he was enrolled at the college.

'UMass
 Dartmouth has learned that a person being sought in connection with the
 Boston Marathon bombing has been identified as a student registered at 
UMass Dartmouth. The campus is closed. Individuals on campus should 
shelter in place unless instructed otherwise,' a school spokesman said 
in a statement.

Officials
called for businesses to remain closed and asked for their 
cooperation in keeping their employees off the streets.

Taxi services 
have been suspended as well.

In some areas, cars were banned from 
the roads as another tact for authorities to keep control of the area.

No hustle: As the manhunt continued into the afternoon, there was still no sign of life at Boston's Downtown Crossing

Lonely: The wallkway by Commonwealth Avenue was completely abandoned

Initially
 residents of Watertown, Waltham, Belmont, Newton, Cambridge, Alston and
 Brighton were specifically warned to stay inside, as they are the 
neighborhoods near the home of the suspects on Norfolk Street in 
Cambridge.

Police conducted a door-to-door search
 in Watertown, warning that if anyone other than federal officials are 
seen in the area or ask to enter a home, the residents should call 911.

Between 250,000 and estimated 400,000 people live in those towns.

At the 8am press briefing, the shelter-in-place order was extended to include all of Boston.

Suspect: Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, now 19-years-old, is seen in these two pictures that were released by authorities

Shelter in place: Earlier orders highlighted the towns surrounding Watertown, but it was expanded to include all of Boston

Opposite: Historic Faneuil Hall (on the left) is one of Boston's busiest hubs of activity in normal circumstances

Bizarre: The emptiness of the streets was unnerving for many Bostonians who kept in touch using social media

Ghost town: Storrow Drive was almost entirely empty after the lockdown

Governor
 Patrick reiterated that order at the press briefing, warning Bostonians
 'not to open the door for anyone other than a properly identified 
officer'.

Officials are not 
taking the situation lightly, issuing a warning to residents that 'a 
terrorist that wants to kill people is in your area'.

'We're going to need the public to help us help them keep us safe,' Mr Patrick said.

'We have every asset that we could muster.'
