A Czech fraudster who flew vulnerable foreign nationals to Britain so they could falsely claim £1.2million in benefits has been jailed after spending almost six months on the run.

Magdalena Ferkova, 33, was part of a five-strong family gang who made £33,000 a week from the scam - but she fled Britain in November during her trial.

A European Arrest Warrant was issued the next month and finally she was recaptured in her home country and returned to Britain.

Ringleaders: Julius Ziga, left, 34, and 
Magdalena Ferkova, right, 33, brought Czechs and Slovaks to claim child 
tax credits in Britain then continued collecting the cash after the 
foreigners returned to Eastern Europe

Also jailed: Iveta Ferkova, 32, left, and Jan 
Lacko, 39, right, were part of the gang which managed around 50 
fraudulent child tax credit claims to pocket up to £33,000 a week, much 
of which was gambled away

Ferkova and her partner, Julius Ziga, 
34, masterminded a racket in which countless false claims were made for 
tax credits and child benefit.

They and her sister Iveta, 32, their aunt Alena Lackova, 39, and Lackova's husband Jan Lacko, 39, spent their criminal gains in casinos and on luxury cars - including a Mercedes and BMW 5 Series.

Their
 trial at Nottingham Crown Court heard they successfully took £750,000 
and would have made another £500,000 had they not been caught.

During
 the scam, the couple arranged for vulnerable foreign nationals from the
 Czech Republic and Slovakia to be brought to Nottingham, where they 
were told they would be given jobs.

The

 gang then took their passports, housed them in the city temporarily and
 'helped' them to get a National Insurance number and open a bank 
account.

Incriminating: A list found on Magdalena Ferkova when she was arrested where she had written out pin numbers and days of the week to draw out tax credit money from the gang's various accounts

After forcing the individuals to make applications for tax credits and Child Benefit, the gang sent the claimants home.

Ferkova,
 who lived in Nottingham while in the UK, absconded during the trial last year and a warrant was issued for her arrest.

She was tracked down in her home country after 
officials at HM Revenue & Customs listed her on their Most Wanted 
gallery of tax fugitives.

Carolyn
 Norsworthy, assistant director in charge of criminal investigation, said: 'Magdalena Ferkova thought she could 
flee the country to avoid justice. She was wrong.

'We
 have tracked her down and, working with the Czech authorities, have 
brought her before the UK courts so justice can be served.

interpreters in interviews at banks and Jobcentres

The gang, including Elena Lackova and Jan Lacko,
 left, made 77 false claims to steal £750,000 in tax credits 
from HMRC, using the cash to buy cars like the 5 Series BMW pictured right with Magdalena Ferkova

'Ferkova
 was part of an extremely well-organised and ruthless crime group, 
committed to stealing vast amounts of public money at the expense of the
 British taxpayer.

'They 
exploited the many people they lured to the UK from abroad with the 
promise of legal employment, but then manipulated and discarded them.'

Ferkova was brought before Nottingham Crown Court today where she was jailed for five years.

Judge James Sampson told her: 'You are obviously a clever woman and intelligent, but thoroughly dishonest and a brazen liar.'

The series of 77 false claims were made to HMRC 
between January 1, 2008 and April 14, 2010, and the four other gang members received sentences totalling 12 years.

All five denied conspiracy to commit fraud by making false representations, except Ziga, who pleaded guilty.

The
 five fraudsters have been recommended for deportation at the end of 
their sentences, and proceedings were started last year to confiscate 
the spoils of their crimes.
