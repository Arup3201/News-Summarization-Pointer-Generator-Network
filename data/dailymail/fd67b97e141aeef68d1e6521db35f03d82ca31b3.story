As the great quiz show philosopher Jim Bowen once said, you can’t beat a bit of Bully. Back in the old days, that meant you might have ended up winning a caravan. Or even a speedboat. Something that would block your driveway, anyway.

Nowadays, if you’re Jimmy Bullard, it means you have seen off all the competition (and some disgusting bits of animal you’ve eaten) to become King of the jungle.

Now of course plenty of football fans know all about Jimmy as a much travelled and gifted player. And quite a few of them also know that a sadly injury-blighted career meant that his hereditary cheeky chapiness (he’s an East End boy!) has made him a popular face on on football programmes.

Bullard had previously said that he would 'jump through the roof' if he saw a spide or snake at home 

The retired footballer looked a little sheepish while having to put his hand into a wooden box

But it is probably fair to say that to much of the audience tuning in on Sunday evening for the first night of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, he is more like ‘Jimmy who?’.

Which hasn’t stopped many a vaguely familiar boy band member, or completely anonymous glamour model, making a bit of a name for themselves on the reality TV circuit, of course. But it’s been over ten years since Phil Tufnell wore the crown for the world of sport. So can Jimmy hit the bullseye this time around?

Well, he certainly made an immediate impression when he made his entrance. Jimmy was meeting his team-mates at the hotel and nearly went down at the edge of the pool. 

The 36-year-old was a lucky member 'Group A', who spent the first night in luxury

His most famous celebration came in the form of a mock team-talk he gave his Hull team-mates in 2009

You can take the man out of football….But he had nothing immediately to worry about as his half of the celebrity line up got an extra night of luxury, courtesy the great voting public. Straight into the thick of things with his half of the contestants was sports other contender beneath the canopy, Carl ‘I’m Foggy’ Fogarty MBE.

Foggy seemed to have a less laid back approach to it all than Jimmy, as he began his jungle challenge. He told us in no uncertain terms that the three things he didn’t like were ‘being hungry, being bored, and being with people’. Erm?

But Foggy, it turns out, is made of sterner stuff than that. As Craig Charles and Vicky Michelle both pointed out, he was quite the ‘boy scout’ on the first night when he immediately got a fire going.

Carl Fogarty had to complete the Buried Alive Bush Tucker trial as part of his first day in the jungle

The former Superbike champion was covered in snakes, but barely flinched during the challenge

Although I don’t think you can get a badge for putting up with TOWIE’s Gemma Collin’s snoring!

And he was the first to take a Bush Tucker trial. ‘Bring it on’ he told the boys as he relaxed in a drain full of pythons. Although perhaps the most nervous part was having one of them gently removed from his shorts by a lady after he successfully completed the challenge.

Quite frankly, nothing I have seen from him so far doesn’t suggest that by about Wednesday, he’ll have fashioned a spear, tied on a headband, slapped on the camouflage make up and headed off into the trees to catch his own dinner. Oh, and possibly garrotted Gemma. But is he going to be just too self-assured to win over the viewers?

49-year-old Fogarty looks as though he will take to life in the jungle quite easily

TOWIE's Gemma Collins enjoyed a cold shower after a dramatic start to life in the jungle 

After a good night’s kip, Jimmy checked out of the hotel, and into hell. That is, if you can call hanging around on a beach with Melanie Sykes hell.

While she then does all the hard work on the first challenge, with it! Yes, I suspect the only badges Jimmy has ever got are the ones on the front of his various football shirts.

But Melanie didn’t seem to mind Jimmy did, quite frankly, nothing. Although the viewers weren’t quite so laid back, as he was given the first trial of day two. But will his efforts be enough to help him across the line?

There is, by the way, a third chance, sort of, for sport to triumph in the undergrowth. ‘Model and Singer’ Nadia Forde is a one time girlfriend of Rory McIlroy and has yet to really make any real impact other than to have the pleasure of giving Gemma a shower. 

But as the Essex girl pointed out, ‘I’m A Celebrity...’ is all about ‘the turtle and the slug. Or horse and the rabbit?’. And you really can’t argue with that.

Rory McIlroy's former girlfriend Nadia Forde hasn't managed to make an impact on the show just yet
