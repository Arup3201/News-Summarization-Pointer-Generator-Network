She was a world-class athlete and one of our top medal hopes for the Olympics.

Modelling her Team GB kit earlier this year, triathlete Hollie Avil appeared to be in peak physical condition.

But she shook the sports world when she announced she was ending her career – revealing that she was suffering from an overpowering eating disorder.

Now the 22-year-old has revealed the 
full extent of her battle with food, admitting perfectionism caused her 
to be ‘her own worst enemy’.

She said her five-year struggle with weight loss stemmed from an off-the-cuff comment by a coach.

She explained: ‘When I was 16 I 
competed at the Junior World Championships, coming 11 out of 80 girls. I
was really chuffed but my coach said, “Swimming won’t make you faster 
Hollie, losing weight will make you run faster. You need to watch that 
weight of yours”.

‘I was shocked,’ she went on. ‘Nobody 
had ever mentioned my weight before and I didn’t think there was 
anything wrong with it  – but I instantly took it to heart.

‘In the weeks that followed I weighed 
myself constantly and cut down my food. I didn’t for a moment realise 
that what I was doing was abnormal.’

‘I was my own worst enemy. I trained at the weekend with senior athletes and I would look at what they were eating.

‘I’d notice they wouldn’t have butter 
on their bread and would only eat salad. I thought, “Well if they’re 
doing it, I should too”.’

The coach’s comment saw the teenager drastically reduce her calorie intake.

While female athletes typically 
require around 3,000 calories a day, Hollie cut her meals down to only 
porridge, made with water rather than milk, a whole lettuce and a cereal
bar.

But her high-powered three-hour daily workout would leave her feeling weak.

She told Grazia magazine: ‘My training
definitely suffered because of my diet. In swimming I was so thin I’d 
get too cold in the water. I also struggled to float as I didn’t have 
the buoyancy. But I was addicted to not eating and kept getting thinner 
and thinner.’

After winning the Junior European 
Championships in 2007, she began to think that eating less was the key 
to her success. But then the disease began to eat away at her.

She was tired and agitated and 
suffered from repeated colds and illnesses. She only realised that she 
needed help after her parents saw her bony spine protruding from her 
kit.

She was persuaded to see a 
nutritionist, but it wasn’t until she suffered stress fractures that she
decided to abandon her 2012 dreams last month.

Although she has described the 
decision as heartbreaking, Hollie now says she is relieved to have 
escaped the pressure of top level sport before  she did permanent damage
to her health.

Between 2006 and 2007, she dropped 
more than a stone before her trainer Ben Bright realised that she had a 
problem and pushed her towards recovery.

He discussed the disorder with her parents and showed her statistics that proved she was faster when heavier.

Her condition improved and in 2007 and
2008 a series of wins meant that she was ranked world number one in the
triathalon – a multi-sport discipline involving swimming, cycling and 
running.

But an unrelated illness wrecked her hopes for the Beijing Olympics and she suffered a recurrence in 2010.

Stress fractures, probably caused by 
her reduced bone density, and the pressure of London 2012, caused her 
final spin into self-doubt, leading to her retirement. 

Eating disorders are not unusual among top athletes, according to experts.

Up to 60 per cent of female athletes 
suffer from eating disorders, according to a 2011 study by researchers 
at Austin State University, Texas.
