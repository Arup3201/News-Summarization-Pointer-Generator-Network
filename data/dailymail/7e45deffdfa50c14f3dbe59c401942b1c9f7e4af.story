A motorist was stunned when he discovered double yellow lines had been painted underneath his car while it was parked - and then given a ticket.

Flecks of yellow paint were even sprayed on the bumper of Patrick McCrystal's car as the lines were painted under the front of it in Kedleston Street, Derby.

The 49-year-old had parked his Ford Fiesta in the street near to a Co-operative store and a petrol station, where he works, for three years.

Stunned: Patrick McCrystal with his Ford Fiesta, which was given a ticket after council workmen had sprayed yellow lines under the car while it was parked legally

When he parked for his 2pm shift, he noticed new yellow lines had been painted across a housing block entrance.

But there was a gap between those lines and existing ones in the street, so Mr McCrystal parked there, in his usual spot.

Hours later, a colleague on his dinner break saw that extra lines had been painted below the front of Mr McCrystal's car.

And, when he went out, Mr McCrystal discovered he had been given a parking ticket.

Tell-tale sign: The workmen left flecks of paint on the bumper of the car as they sprayed underneath

He said: 'There is even paint on my front bumper where they've caught it reaching under to paint the lines.

'There were no lines there when I parked. I can't believe they've done it.'

The new lines extended from existing double yellow lines which had previously ended about two feet from Mr McCrystal's front bumper.

Apology: The ticket left on Mr McCrystal's window. Derby City Council blamed a breakdown in communication and has now revoked the £70 fine

Now a Derby City Council official has said the £70 fine had been issued in error and would be revoked.

Mr McCrystal, from Derby, said notices had been put up several weeks ago saying parking restrictions would be introduced but they did not say when.

He said: 'If they were going to paint yellow lines then they should have put up cones to stop people parking.

'When I pulled up, I saw the gap between the old lines and the new ones and thought it was okay to park there. Nothing gave me the impression I couldn't.'

A passer-by said council staff had been angered they could not paint the lines because of the parked car.

David Gartside, head of traffic and transport at the authority, said: 'We can confirm that lining was painted on Kedleston Street this afternoon after the vehicle had parked and that a parking ticket was issued to the vehicle in error.

'It appears that there was a communication breakdown between our contractors undertaking the lining work and our enforcement officers.

'The ticket will be revoked and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.'
