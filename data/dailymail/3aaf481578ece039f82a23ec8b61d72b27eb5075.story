Michael Bloomberg's youngest daughter has revealed that she is due to give birth to a baby boy on Christmas Day.

Georgina, 30, a professional 
equestrian first announced she was pregnant with Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s first grandchild in June.

But she said she was not planning to marry her boyfriend Argentinian equestrian Ramiro Quintan anytime soon. 

Due date: Michael Bloomberg's youngest daughter Georgina, 30, has revealed that she is due to give birth to a baby boy on Christmas Day.

On the circuit: The father is her boyfriend Ramiro Quintana who is a fellow equestrian

Speaking at a party to celebrate her 
Hamptons Magazine cover she said, 'I live with my boyfriend, but I never
 want to get married. I’ve always been non-traditional. My father hasn’t
 pressured me to get married. He respects my decision.

'I
 will have the baby in New York and then move to Florida, where I spend 
the winter. I am reading baby books and looking at names, but we haven’t
 decided yet,' she told the New York Post.

She said despite the pregnancy, she will ride in the upcoming Hampton 
Classic Horse Show, although it will be her last show.

By dad's side: Georgina has said that her father is not the best with kids so he will likely not be babysitting often

Georgina competes on the same horse racing circuit Ramiro Quintana.

Although
 her spokesman previously said that the family was very happy when the 
pregnancy was announced, other sources say that her father is upset 
about how fast her relationship with the reported ladies’ man has 
escalated.

This will be the New York City Mayor's first grandchild as his older daughter Emma, 34, has been married for eight years but does not have a child.

'Georgina is pretty excited about the baby, but her dad isn’t too happy about it. It’s so sudden,' an unidentified source in Wellington, Florida told Gossip Extra.

Georgina splits her time between New York and Florida as there are a number of horse races in Wellington in the winter months.

'Georgina can do better when it comes to men. The guy’s known for his roving eye and partying as much as his riding,' the source continued.

The New York Post reports that she and Quintana have been 
'quietly dating for a while' and Gossip Extra specifies that they had 
been together for six months when the pregnancy was revealed.

She previously dated fellow show jumper Cian O'Connor and is also believed to have had a relationship with speed skater Joey Cheek.

Mr Bloomberg, 71, has indulged his daughter's passion for equestrian and paid for at least six horses, which she keeps on estates in North Salem, New York, and Wellington, Florida.

The family also have a lavish property portfolio including neighboring waterfront homes in Bermuda for Miss Bloomberg.

The Bloombergs are amongst the richest people in America and Mr Bloomberg has an estimated personal fortune of $18.1 billion earned through his eponymous financial information company.

But their personal lives were thrown into the spotlight two years ago when Miss Bloomberg published her novel 'The A Circuit.'

The book concerns Wall St billionaire Rick Aaronson, his two daughters and their family squabbles.

His eldest daughter Camille went to an Ivy League colleague and wants to move into politics.

His youngest daughter Tommi is an award-winning horse rider who refuses to do what her father tells her.

'She wasn't afraid to say no to her father,' Tommi says in the book. 'Even if half of Wall Street was.'

By coincidence, Miss Bloomberg's sister Emma went to Princeton and now works with her father City Hall in New York. Another parallel is Miss Bloomberg's own interest in horses.
