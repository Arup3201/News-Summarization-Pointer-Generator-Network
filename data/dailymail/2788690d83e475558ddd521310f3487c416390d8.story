While @MadiBurke wrote: 'Hi Tucker! I heard your dad wanted to find you a date. Its funny: my mom said the same thing 5 minutes ago. @TuckerWest1 #teamtucker DM me?'

you someday but in the meantime as a parent it was so funny. Just you 
being you and showing your love for your boy!'

 else you've done for the boy more than makes up for it! It came from

Living out his dreams: Tucker takes a turn during a training session for the men's singles luge at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Krasnaya Polyana, Russia

Unbreakable bond: The stunt didn't do any long-lasting damage to the father-son relationship and Tucker tweeted: 'He's still the best dad I could have ever asked for!'

After wrapping up his Olympic journey 
yesterday, Tucker will now have time to sift through all of his date proposals.

His long slide to the Games began on a luge track his dad built in their backyard.

Inspired
 by watching the sliding sport during the 2002 Salt Lake Games with 
Tucker, then only six, Brett West decided to construct a luge run behind
 the family's home in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

Without even drawing up plans, the Wests went to work and wound up with a functional, 800-foot-long wooden track.

The
 Wests even nicknamed a few of the turns, including McClaine's Curve, 
because it bent toward the home of their neighbors, the McClaines.

Road to success: Tucker's long slide to the Games began on a luge track his dad built in their backyard

Tucker, the youngest-ever member of the U.S. luge team, credits the track with getting him started and says that it still works today.

He was front and center on the international stage Sunday as he 
competed in the final day of the men’s single luge competition for Team 
USA.

The teenager finished 22nd overall, and placed second among the American men’s team.

Germany's
 defending Olympic champion Felix Loch again took the gold, while 
Russian and Italian veteran lugers earned the silver and bronze, 
respectively.

After wrapping up his time in Sochi, Tucker will start school at Union College in Schenectady, New York, for spring term.
