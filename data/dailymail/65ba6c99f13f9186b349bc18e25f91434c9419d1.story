Miraculous recovery: Jack Widdowson, 19, on his feet dancing again after being paralysed in a street attack

A real-life Billy Elliot who was paralysed after a street attack has defied doctors by dancing again.

Professional ballet star Jack Widdowson, 19, suffered serious spinal injuries last November just two days after a starring stage role.

His devastated family rushed to his bedside and doctors feared he would be never be able to dance again after the attack in Cardiff, south Wales. 

Just 48 hours earlier Jack had 
achieved his life-long dream of dancing in a leading role by performing 
as Demetrius in Bern's Stadttheater in Switzerland. 

Now after just five months, Jack has 
performed his first jump and has been offered a number of stage roles. He does 120 push ups each night as he battles to get fit again.

He will dance in public next month for
the first since being injured in a short performance with the English 
National Ballet. Then in June he will take a leading role in a 
contemporary dance production.

'There was just something in me saying
''I am going to dance again''. I really, really want to get back to it.
To me, dancing is indescribable. You do it because you love it,' he 
told the Sunday Telegraph. 

The attack on November 5 marked a 
dramatic turn of events for Jack. Two nights earlier on November 3 he performed in front of his proud 
father, Julian, a doctor.

Jack had been an understudy in the 
premiere of Ein Winternachtstraum, a reworking of A Midsummer Night's 
Dream - but was catapulted into the role of Demetrius after one of the 
dancers broke his wrist.

Dr Widdowson, 53, texted his wife, Celia, and the happy couple believed that their son would have a glittering career on the stage.

Jack and his father flew back to the 
UK the following day and went to Cardiff to celebrate the
recent performance with his two  brothers George, 17, and Mark, 21.

The stage star, from Farmborough, 
north east Somerset, was walking home but became separated from his friends when the incident happened on a 
canal path.

Back at the family home in Bath, 
Somerset, Dr and Mrs Widdowson, were toasting to their son's success 
when there was a knock on the door from police.

Their joy turned to shock as officers told them there had been an incident in which their son had
been taken to the University Hospital of Wales with serious neck 
injuries.

The parents, two brothers, and sister 
Chloe, now 23, kept a bedside vigil, but they began to plan for what 
life would be like for Jack.

Their son had no feeling from the neck down and they thought about how they could adapt his computer.

But Jack was determined that he would dance again.

'Somehow I didn't ever think: ''That's
it, I'm never going to walk again''. I did certainly wonder if I could 
return to Switzerland for the next week's performance,' he added.

Over the next few months spurred on his attitude Jack slowly regained feelings in his limbs as he underwent physiotherapy.

He spent much of the day just trying 
to move his wrists but within four weeks was already taking his first 
steps and had left hospital in just six weeks.

Jack was then asked to perform in two 
productions, including a short piece for the English National Ballet 
next month and in June a newly written work for A.D. Dance Company in 
London on June 29.

Jack added: 'I don't exactly know how 
it's going to pan out, but I think I will be able to do it. I'm nervous 
but really, really excited.'

Paul Rhys Davies, the consultant who operated on Jack, said he was 'thrilled' by the 'fantastic recovery'.

A 26-year-old man is awaiting trial in connection with the attack.
