The baby girl, who has yet to be named, was born Thursday in a village in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh

'My sister-in-law gave birth to a girl at 7:00 a.m. and her face looks exactly like Lord Ganesha. Everybody is saying she is an incarnation of the God,' the baby's aunt Rajani told ANI.

'This is why whoever hears about her is coming here to get a glimpse of the baby and are making whatever offerings possible.'

The girl comes from a poor family with her father, a vegetable vendor who earns 250 rupee ($5.17) per day, hoping his daughter's birth will bring the family better luck, the Times of India reported.

She has three healthy older siblings and lives in a small house in the northern Indian village.

Doctors said the girl's protrusion was most likely due to a gene mutation, caused by malnutrition and pollution.

Locals have nicknamed her 'Lord Ganpatni' meaning 'Ganesha's wife' after the elephant-headed god
