ITV's This Morning faces an investigation over a Fifty Shades of Grey feature named 'Bondage for Beginners' where they discussed and tested sex toys at 11am.

Ofcom said today it had received 120 complaints about the February 3 show where a scantily-clad couple were seen on a bed playing kinky games on live television.

Presenter Philip Schofield had said before the segment it would be in 'good taste', but viewers disagreed, calling it 'pornographic' and 'highly inappropriate' for morning television.

Several complained that they were forced to answer questions about bondage from their children, who had been watching it with them.

Investigation: ITV's This Morning  segment called Bondage For Beginners, which featured a live demonstration of 50 Shades of Grey inspired sex toys, now faces an Ofcom investigation

Presenters Christine Bleakley and Phillip Schofield giggled their way through the segment, but maintained it was in 'good taste'

An Ofcom spokesman said today: 'Ofcom has opened an investigation into whether an item about 'bondage for beginners' was suitable for broadcast before the watershed.'

The 'Bondage For Beginners' session was inspired by the new film of the controversial erotic novel 50 Shades Of Grey, which opened in cinemas in mid-February.

Presenters Christine Bleakley and Phillip Schofield giggled their way through the show, which also featured a discussion about sex toys. 

Two models in their underwear were shown in bed using a 'feather tickler' and discussion moved on to other sex toys like nipple-clamps.

Mr Schofield, 52, had warned viewers shortly after 10.30am that they would be discussing bondage equipment in three stages – beginners, intermediate and advanced – throughout the show with 'sexpert' Annabelle Knight. However he assured them it would 'be done in good taste'.

Yet at one point he was so distracted by the romping models that he missed his cue to introduce the next section, while Miss Bleakley, 36, who is engaged to footballer Frank Lampard, found herself laughing uncontrollably.

Campaigners said it was an error of judgment to air the discussion at that time of day. 

Vivienne Pattison, director of Mediawatch UK, said the show had set a dangerous example: 'It's not enough to say most children will be at school [at that time] because that's just not good enough.

'Quite apart from issues of taste and the fact that people might not want to speak to their children about this, I think it is dangerous to normalise this kind of behaviour. [50 Shades Of Grey] is putting across ideas that humiliation is pleasurable and torture is gratifying and I don't think those are healthy for anybody at all. 

'But if it is dangerous for adults then it is doubly dangerous for children watching this'. 

Pre-watershed: At 11am on Valentine's Day two models in their underwear were shown in bed using a 'feather tickler' and discussion moved on to other sex toys like nipple-clamps.

Viewers were not impressed either and expressed their anger online.

Tracey Johnson tweeted: 'Used to love This Morning but today was final straw, sitting with my mum, on comes the bondage #nothanks.'

Mother Nikki wrote: 'Ok bondage for beginners had to be turned over, can't cope with questions from the nine-year-old.'

Another said on Twitter: '#BondageForBeginners is ridiculously inappropriate. This programme is on at my health club where there are children.'

A friend added: 'Too early for this talk #BondageForBeginners. This is porn now @itvthismorning #FiftyShades #inappropriate.'

ITV defended itself at the time and said it had warned viewers.

A spokesman said: 'This Morning is a lifestyle programme that cover a diverse range of human interest topics.

'The programme has dealt with advice on sexual matters many times in the past, and a suitable announcement was given at the start.'
