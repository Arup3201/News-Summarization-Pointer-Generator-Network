Yoselyn Ortega, the nanny accused of viciously stabbing to death the two young children under her care, had been suffering emotionally and financially, her friends and family said.

Her sister, Celia Ortega, told the New York Post that the nanny, who worked for a family on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, just ‘snapped.’ The sister added: ‘We don’t understand what happened to her mind.’

The 50-year-old Ortega remains hospitalized from self-inflicted stab wounds, including a deep gash to her throat. Sources say that she is still in a ‘catatonic’ state, refusing to talk to police or physicians, and has still has not been charged for the deaths of Leo, two, and Lucia, six.

Though family members acknowledged 
Ortega’s recent struggle with money and mental issues, none could 
understand how she could allegedly commit such a heinous act. Relatives 
in Ortega's native Dominican Republic said they were shocked by the 
allegations.

Milaydys Ortega, the nanny's older 
sister in the Caribbean nation, told The Associated Press on Saturday 
that her sister 'loved those children.' She said the family felt the 
nanny was 'unable to do that.'

'Yoselyn is fair, loving, loving with
those children. She loved them,' Ortega said at the family home in 
Santiago de los Caballeros, about 150 miles north of the capital, Santo 
Domingo. She spoke as she prepared to attend Mass after visiting the 
grave of their mother.

She said the Krims had visited the 
Dominican Republic last February with Yoselyn and stayed at her home in a
middle-class district of Santiago.

'Those children were here,' Milaydys Ortega said tearfully. 'They were happy, running, playing.'

Yoselyn’s 17-year-old son, Jesus, 
told Milaydys that his mother was innocent. ‘Auntie, I know it couldn’t 
have been my mother,’ he said, according to the New York Post. ‘Those 
kids were like my brother and sister.’

According to the New York Times, Ortega still hasn't been charged in their deaths.

Meanwhile, police continue to 
investigate the Krim’s apartment on W. 75th street for possible clues. 
Since the tragedy on Thursday, well-wishers and mourners alike have laid
flowers and other tokens of sympathy in front of the building

Miladys told the AP that Yoselyn is 
the youngest of six siblings, most of whom live in the United States. 
Her sister emigrated to America in the early 1980s after graduating from
accounting studies at Santa Ana College in Santiago.

Yoselyn Ortega worked as the manager 
of a print shop in Manhattan, until she separated from the father of her
child. She returned to Santiago for a while, but then went back to the 
U.S., her sister said.

Miladys Ortega said that when her 
sister got back to New York, she couldn't find an accounting job and 
decided to work as a nanny because she loves children.

During her last conversations with Yoselyn, her sister didn't say anything that seemed unusual.

'Yoselyn always was a normal person. 
When she was a child, she played, always played a lot. We would go into 
the countryside,' she said. 'As an adult, she dedicated herself to 
working. She was always working.'

Juan Pozo, a 67-year-old car service 
driver who formerly rented a room from the Ortega family, told The New 
York Times that the nanny's sister told him Friday that she had 'felt 
like she was losing her mind' lately, and had recently been taken by 
relatives to visit a psychologist.

Police said they were unaware of any 
significant history of psychological problems for Ortega, but were 
investigating whether she had recently sought treatment.

Neighbor Ruben Rivas told reporters she seemed to have suddenly aged in recent weeks and had lost weight.

Other friends said that while she was
paid well by her domestic employers, Kevin and Marina Krim, and seemed 
happy with her job, she had suffered a financial setback when she had to
give up an apartment she had rented in the Bronx, and recently moved 
back in with her sister in Harlem.

William Krim, grandfather to the 
slain children, told the Times he wasn't aware of any conflicts between 
the family and the nanny.

'We're just the most stunned people in the world. I mean, they treated this woman so well,' he said.

Found: The nanny, Yoselyn Ortega, is taken out on a stretcher covered in blood. She is in critical condition

When she was in her 20s, Ortega began traveling to New York City  - a place she loved - and she eventually moved there.

Ortega started out working for a printing company, but her sister Celia suggested that she go into child care instead since she 'always loved children, according to the sister.

Yoselyn Ortega met the Krims just two years ago, but the short period of time was enough for them to become 'like one family,' her sister said. The nanny loved the three children in her care, and their mother, Marina Krim, quickly took to Yoselyn’s 17-year-old son, Jesus.

'Marina used to say, “I have four children,”’ Ortega recounted to the Daily News. ‘She considered Jesus one of her own.'

It was Jesus Ortega who broke the terrible news to his aunt Friday. 'He told me, “She didn't do this. This is not her,"' Ortega said.

'We don't know what happened,' she continued. 'There was never any indication of anything like this happening. Only her, the children and God know.

'We still can't believe she did this to people she loved so much.’
