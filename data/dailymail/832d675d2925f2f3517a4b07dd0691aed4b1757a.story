A teenager's bedroom was destroyed by her hair extenstions after she blow-dried them for so long that they became so hot they set her bed on fire.

After drying the fake locks with a hairdryer, Natasha Lee, 17, left them on her bed while she went downstairs to start her homework.

But when she returned a few minutes later she was horrified to find them engulfed in flames and her bedroom in Morecambe, Lancashire, full of smoke.

Destroyed: Natasha Lee's bedroom was destroyed after she blow dried her hair extensions, similar to those pictured, for so long they became red-hot and left them on her bed

Scene: After drying the locks, Natasha left them on her bed while she went downstairs to start her homework

Devastated: When she returned a few minutes later she was horrified to find them engulfed in flames and her bedroom in Morecambe, Lancashire, full of smoke

Firefighters were called to tackle the flames, but the blaze on Tuesday evening caused extensive damage to her family home.

'I couldn’t believe my eyes,' Natasha said. 'I’d washed my hair extensions and I’d been drying them for about five minutes.

'I switched off the dryer and left them lying on my bed. I’d only been downstairs about two minutes and when I came back my room was on fire.

Family: Natasha and her mother Szbtlana Froloza, 52, escaped unhamed, and the teenager was also able to free her dog and two cats from the flames

Charred remains: All that is left of the hairdryer that caused Natasha's hair extensions to catch fire

Shock: Natasha had thought that the smoke was coming from outside, and did not realise there was a fire inside her room until she turned to see her burning bed

'When I first saw the smoke I thought maybe it was coming from outside. I didn’t for one second think there was a fire until I turned and saw the bed.

'I ran back downstairs and called 999. It was terrifying.'

By the time fire crews arrived, the fire had broken through the first floor bedroom window, with smoke and flames billowing out.

Property: Many of Natasha's belongings have been completely destroyed in the fire

Natasha and her mother Szbtlana Froloza, 52, escaped unhamed, and the teenager was also able to free her dog and two cats from the flames. 

The fire had severely damaged the bedroom, while the landing and one other room on the first floor were also damaged by smoke.

Forced to leave: Natasha and her mother are staying with friends until the house is repaired

Natasha said: 'It’s really scary to think it could have been so much worse.

'It’s awful that we can’t live in our house at the moment and we’ve lost so much of our belongings but we’re so grateful we’re all ok.

'We managed to get our pets out too and so we’re trying to focus on the positives.

'They say you learn from experience and I know I will. I certainly won’t be buying hair extensions again and I hope others realise the dangers.'

Natasha said she had bought the brown hair extensions from EBay for £30 and that they were advertised as being made from real hair.

She added: 'I really think they should come with a warning on them. People just don’t realise they can set on fire like that - I know I didn’t.

'I still don’t really know how they set alight. I think they just got too hot and then leaving them on the bed made it worse.

'If I hadn’t walked back upstairs when I did I dread to think what could have happened.

'My room is ruined and there’s a lot of smoke damage upstairs but at least downstairs is okay.

'We’re just trying to move on from it now and put it behind us. There’s no point dwelling on it.'

Natasha and her mother are staying with friends until the house is repaired.

Warren Topp, Green Watch Manager at Lancaster Fire Station, said: 'The fire was caused by accidental ignition to human hair extensions and bedding, the source of ignition was a hairdryer.'
