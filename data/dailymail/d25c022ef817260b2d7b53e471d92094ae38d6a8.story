Glen Johnson has backed Liverpool to succeed this season despite selling Luis Suarez, having already proved that they can win without the mercurial Uruguay striker.

After banking £75million from Suarez’s move to Barcelona, Liverpool have strengthened by spending close to £90m on Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren, Emre Can, Lazar Markovic and Divock Origi.

They are still in the market for another striker after Loic Remy’s move to Anfield from QPR collapsed, and remain in talks to sign Spanish defenders Alberto Moreno and Javier Manquillo from Sevilla and Atletico Madrid.

Big money move: Barcelona spent £75million on acquiring the Uruguayan striker after the World Cup 

Liverpool were without Suarez at the end of the 2012-13 campaign and start of last season after he was banned for 10 games for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. However, they won six of the matches and only lost once, and Johnson believes they can compensate for the loss of a striker who scored 31 goals last season.

‘It gets overlooked that we played the first six games of last season without Luis and made a fantastic start so we can clearly win without him,’ said the England defender.

‘Any team that loses a player like Luis is going to feel it. But we will carry on the way we do, creating chances. I think we were the team who created the most chances last season. We’ve signed some good strikers and I’m sure once they get a chance they will take it.’

Liverpool fell agonisingly short in the title race, losing out to Manchester City on the last day of the season. The demands of Champions League football will make it even harder this time, and they also face City, Tottenham and Everton in the opening six games. But Johnson has seen enough on the club’s pre-season tour of the United States to be believe they will be challengers again.

He added: ‘I think as long as we play the way we did and fight the way we did last season then I’m sure we’ll be happy, but it’s a results game and we want to fight for the title as much as the fans want us to be.

‘We were definitely fresher for not playing Europe last season. And the size of the squad we had last season we probably could not have coped with all the extra games. It was probably an advantage last year. We’re going to have a lot more games this season but hopefully we can keep everyone fit and keep fighting.

‘If you want to win the League, the start of every season is important whoever you play. At the end of the day, whoever you play you are fighting for three points. But we’ve got some big teams early on. Sometimes that can be a good thing, sometimes a bad thing.

‘We’ve been preparing regardless of who we are playing at the start of the season. Hopefully we will win those games, give us a good start and damage our rivals.’
