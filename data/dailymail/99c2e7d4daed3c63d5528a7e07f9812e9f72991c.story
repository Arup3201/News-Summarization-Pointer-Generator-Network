If you like a sprinkle of salt or two on your food, then this is definitely the restaurant for you.

The walls, bar, tables, and chairs of Salt Restaurant Shiraz are made entirely from the mineral, and even the stairs have a smooth, salty coating.

Inspired by salt caves, the architects of the eatery in southern Iran claim their building material cleanses the two-storey bistro of cooking smells and creates positive ions in the atmosphere.

The interior of the restaurant has been designed to twist and turn like the salt caves they were modelled on 

The choice of salt as the main material in the restaurant was used to promote the concept of green construction, news website Iran Front Page reported. 

The designers, from the Iranian-based firm Emtiaz Designing Group, said they wanted to make sure the interiors twisted and turned just like they do in salt caves. 

The building is made from environmentally sustainable, locally sourced and affordable salt, powder and rock. 

A spokesman from the architects said: 'Salt is a natural disinfectant and the ions it releases also purify and filter the air, making it the perfect material for a restaurant.

'In this particular case, the walls, structural sculptures and ceilings are made from salt sourced from the nearby salt mines and salt lake of Shiraz which was mixed with natural gum to harden it.

Salt has been known as a powerful health remedy since ancient times, the architects said

He added: 'Salt suffers a bad reputation in gastronomy thanks to its overuse in most diets, meaning that most people are not aware of its astonishing healing powers.

'But in fact salt has been known as a powerful health remedy since ancient times, especially for respiratory health and detoxification. 

'In many ways, these two functions are the foundation of overall health. Even Hippocrates prescribed salt water inhalation therapy for bronchial and lung disorders.'

Salt therapy involves the therapeutic use of time spent in salt mines, salt caves, or other forms of salt exposure to treat medical conditions, often with remarkable results.
