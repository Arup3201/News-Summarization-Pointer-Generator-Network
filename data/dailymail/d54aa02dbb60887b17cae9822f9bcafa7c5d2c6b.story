In the gun-friendly state of Texas, more pensioners are finding themselves in trouble with the law because they’re packing heat in their hand luggage.

This year, there has been an increase in the number of senior citizens being arrested with firearms at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.

In July and August alone, police arrested 11 people who tried to get through security with firearms in their hand luggage, and almost half were in their 60s and 70s, according to ABC affiliate WFAA.

All five of the pensioners told police they forgot they had a firearm in their bag before it was submitted for screening. Charges were eventually dropped in all cases.

The uptick in arrests could be linked to an increase in the number of older Texans carrying guns, WFAA reported.

Last year, the state granted concealed handgun permits to 67,000 seniors ranging from 60 to 100 years old.

That includes 122 seniors who are in their 90s, an increase from 19 in 2010.

David Prince, owner of Eagle Gun Range just north of Dallas, said he expects the trend of arrests to continue as more pensioners legally arm themselves.

He told WFAA that more seniors have been coming to his range to learn how to fire a gun to protect themselves.

The 65-year-old said: ‘You know how hectic the airport is. I think people are just forgetting. Let's face it, people of my age get a little more forgetful every day.’
