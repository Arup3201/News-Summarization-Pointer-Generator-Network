FIFA has been called on to launch an urgent investigation into an incident which saw Uruguay defender Alvaro Pereira play on after being knocked unconscious against England.

FIFpro, the union representing professional footballers across the globe, insist the incident shows that the world governing body is failing to protect players.

Pereira was knocked out after his head smashed into Raheem Sterling’s knee in the 61st minute of Uruguay’s 2-1 win on Thursday.

The players’ union has called for independent match-day doctors to be introduced to prevent teams flouting head injury guidelines.

‘Football is awash with incidents in which players suffer potentially concussive blows to the head and stay on the pitch,’ FIFpro said in a statement. ‘In Pereira’s case, he demanded to play on, overruling advice from Uruguay’s team doctor for him to be immediately substituted.

‘FIFpro understands that faced by the pressures of such an important international stage, many players would react in this way. There are times, however, when the players also require greater protection against the prospect of making any rash decisions.’

Pereira later apologised for refusing to leave the field after ‘the lights went out’ following the accidental clash but the incident again highlights the problem contact sports face in dealing with what has been termed a ‘global concussion crisis’.

Concussion has become the single biggest issue facing professional sport following a £450million settlement with former American footballers suffering early onset dementia linked to repetitive head injuries. The players had accused the NFL of knowingly underplaying the risks of concussion.

Football, rugby union, rugby league and horse-racing are among the sports reviewing their concussion protocols over fears they too could face crippling lawsuits.

Earlier this month the Mail on Sunday revealed that former England striker Jeff Astle died in 2002 from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a brain disease also found in American footballers, boxers and rugby players.
