After setting out over four months ago, the first cargo train to travel on the longest rail route in the world has returned home.

On November 18, the train departed Yiwu in eastern China, a major wholesale centre for small consumer goods,  and passed through Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany, France and finally Spain.

The entire round-trip is approximately 16,000 miles on the new Yixin'ou cargo line, which ends in the Spanish capital Madrid. 

The train has returned to China after travelling on the world's longest route to Spain

The newly railway route is the longest in the world, longer still than Russia's famous Transsiberian railwa,y linking Moscow to Vladivostok, near Russia's border with China.

The train's 82 shipping containers transported goods made in Zhejiang province, including spinning tops for children and cutting tools. The train returned to China with wine, olive oil and cured ham.

Speaking at a ceremony when the train arrived in Madrid, Li Qiang, the governor of China's Zhejiang province where Yiwu is located, said the route was important to 'implement the strategy of developing a new 'silk road'.

China has a regular direct freight train service to Germany, Europe's largest economy.

Chinese officials are hoping the train route to Spain can stimulate a new economic prosperity

One route links the Chinese megacity of Chongqing to Duisburg, a steel-making town and one of Germany's most-important transportation and commercial hubs.

The other route links Beijing, the Chinese capital, to Hamburg, Germany's second-largest city.

The plan is to create a similar regular route between China and Spain, Spanish Public Works Minister Ana Pastor told reporters after the train arrived at a logistical centre near Madrid's main railway station.

The Spanish capital already is 'a European and international distribution hub' with good links to both Africa and Latin America, she said.

Following the successful journey from Yiwu, China to Madrid, Spain, it is hoped a new 'silk road' can establish trade relations

Euro Cargo Rail, a subsidiary of German freight operator DB Shenker Rail, is studying the possibility of starting a regular service between China and Spain during the first half of next year with two monthly trips.

Roughly 80 percent of global trade is shipped by boat as freight train service faces several technical and bureaucratic hurdles which vary according to country.

The goods on the train which arrived in Madrid for example had to be transferred to different wagons at three points during the trip because of incompatible track gauges in different countries.

But rail transport is less expensive, more environmentally friendly and faster than maritime shipping, according to DB Shenker Rail.

China is the European Union's biggest source of imports, according to the European Commission.
