Hull manager Steve Bruce is weighing up a bid for Blackburn Rovers' £12m-rated striker Jordan Rhodes.

Bruce is in need of another striker after selling Shane Long to Southampton and has been rebuffed by Manchester United's Danny Welbeck while also considering Watford's Troy Deeney, Vincent Aboubakar of Lorient and Steven Fletcher at Sunderland.

Rhodes has scored 52 goals in 90 games for Blackburn since joining from Huddersfield for £8million.

Bruce was dealt a blow on Wednesday after his £7million summer signing Robert Snodgrass was sidelined for six months after dislocating his knee cap.

In addition, Alex Bruce is ruled out with a back injury and, following the sale of Shane Long to Southampton last week, Bruce is fully aware of the need to act before the transfer window slams shut.
