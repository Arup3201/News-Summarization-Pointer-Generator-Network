Louis van Gaal has eased fears over Angel di Maria's injury after the Argentine midfielder was left out of Manchester United's 3-1 win over Newcastle.

The Argentinian midfielder was not selected in the squad for the festive fixture, and MUTV revealed he had been injured in United's final training session before the game.

Di Maria missed three games in December after picking up a hamstring injury against Hull City last month.

The United boss said: 'He stepped out of training in the warm up. It’s not his hamstring or a muscle injury.

'It’s not a heavy injury. It’s the pelvis and the way it is connecting to his leg. We will see what the doctors say' 

It is yet another blow to Van Gaal, who has seen his squad blighted by injuries since he took over at Old Trafford this summer.

Since the end of the World Cup, Untied have suffered 51 injuries to first-team players.

Despite the injury crises, the 13-time Premier League champions have recovered from a poor start and sit third in the table.
