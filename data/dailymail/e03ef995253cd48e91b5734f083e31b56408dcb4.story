If you've been know to let fly with the odd expletive in the presence of your newborn, it might be time to stop.

Scientists have discovered that not only do babies pick up language from their parents, they can understand three times as many words as they can say.

What's more, infants have incredible mnemonic powers which means they can parrot a stray swear word back to you weeks after you let it slip.

Clever: Ella and Finn Burton (pictured with their mother) had learned sign language by the age of six months

The incredible findings will be unveiled on ITV documentary, Secret Life of Babies, which also features twins Ella and Finn Burton, two, from New Maulden in London, who learned to communicate far earlier than their peers.

Because both of their parents are profoundly deaf, the pair were exposed to sign language from birth - and began signing their desires to their parents from the age of six months.

'It's interesting because at the 
beginning when we were at home, it would be just the four of us and we 
would be signing all the time,' reveals their proud father, Toby Burton.

'When they were very young, it felt at 
times as if you were speaking to a brick wall - you didn't get any 
response -Â  and then a few months later, they would tap me and start recalling what I had told them a few weeks or months before.'

While Ella and Finn were able to build upon their parents use of sign language, babies born to average parents are equally good at remembering words - even if it does take them longer to vocalise it.

Proof: The pair appear to bear out scientists' findings by learning to communicate before they could talk

Evolved: Babies are naturally afraid of plants but learn the correct response to animals from their parents

Clever: Most babies learn to talk by watching their parents' mouths and copying the motion

'I
 found it amazing how they were able to recall that information,' adds Mr Burton. 'Once
 they had mastered sign language, they could re-tell that story to me 
very clearly.'

Interestingly, the twins' ability to communicate in sign language has had no impact on their ability to pick up spoken words.

'They
 have started going to nursery and are hearing sound and spoken language
 a lot more so now they use spoken and sign language at the
 same time,' says their mother, Emma.

'If they hear 
someone speaking, they respond using their spoken language,' adds Mr Burton. 'If they see 
someone signing, they will respond in sign so they're using a mixture of
 both.'

As the documentary reveals, Ella and Finn's incredible communication skills aren't unique, with all babies born with the ability to recognise the 150 different sounds that make up every language in the world.

But speaking isn't the only surprising skill common to the majority of babies. Most babies loathe plants, a quirk that scientists say evolved to protect them from poisonous and thorny fauna.

Equally interesting is the reason for babies' seemingly magical ability to drop off to sleep during car journeys.

According to scientists, this goes back to hearing their mother's heart beat while in the womb which they can hear so loudly, its decibel equivalent is the sound of a car engine.

The muffled sounds 
of the engine and the gentle rocking motion of driving mimics life inside the womb, helping them to drift off to sleep - one tip that exhausted new mothers might want to remember.
