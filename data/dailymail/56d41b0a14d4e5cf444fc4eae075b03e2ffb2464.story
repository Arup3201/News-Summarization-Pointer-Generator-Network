Christine Lewis can remember the time when she used to take advantage of the simplest pleasures in life without feeling breathless.

Now the 68-year-old, who has a long history of smoking, counts herself lucky if she makes it back to her house from her backyard. Even taking a shower leaves her exhausted.

Daughter and nurse Vanessa McDonald, of Newcastle, was the first to notice there was something terribly wrong with her mother who became short of breath with minimal physical activity.

Having a respiratory clinical background of 15 years, she knew straight away the diagnosis would be chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Daily Mail Australia can exclusively reveal there 1.5 million Australians effected by the serious chronic lung disease - most of whom are from regional areas.

In severe cases those suffering from COPD may need lung transplants and if detected too late it can ultimately lead to death, a Queensland lung specialist said.

Ms McDonald was visiting her mother at her home in Greta, a suburb in the Hunter Valley region which is two hours north of Sydney, when they decided to go for a walk.

'When I go to visit mum and catch up with her it's usually over coffee so I never noticed anything was wrong,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'Then we were walking around together one day and she was quite breathless with the slightest amount of activity. That to me was evident that she had COPD.

'But when I told mum, she brushed it off saying it was just old age.'

Ms Lewis admits she had been suffering from breathlessness for quite some time - one of the main symptoms of COPD - before her daughter urged her to see a doctor eight years ago.

'I was getting all puffed out just going for short walks but I thought it was just because I was getting old,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's getting worse now. I get worn out having a shower and I just can't go for walks anymore.

'I'm lucky if I make it to the clothesline and back.'

Having been a heavy smoker for more than 40 years, Ms Lewis decided it was finally time to quit her unhealthy habit.

'The disease has completely changed my life and I'm now so dependent on other people,' she said.

'I used to be very active in the past, especially because I don't drive so I walked everywhere. I used to go on 4km walks every day.

'It's very frustrating and I feel useless. I can't even go for walks on the beach with my daughter or grandchildren.'

But her daughter also attributes the cause of COPD to her mother's dedication to her job as a weaving instructor at a local cotton mill for 30 years.

'Working at the  factory and with all the airborne particles which she had been inhaling for all those years - that would be one of the other contributing cause,' Ms McDonald said.

Most of the highest rating areas of COPD hospitalisation are in remote and regional Australia

University of Queensland's professor John Upham - who's also been a senior lung specialist for 20 years - says the main causes of COPD are smoking, air pollution and exposure excessive amounts of dust.

Professor John Upham, of the University of Queensland who's also been a senior lung specialist for 20 years, says COPD is a type of chronic illness damage air passage and lungs.

It is mostly associated with smokers in Australia but can also be caused by air pollution and excessive amounts of dust.

The top three symptoms include: shortness of breath, bringing up phlegm when coughing and wheezing.

The top three symptoms include breathlessness, bringing up phlegm when coughing and wheezing.

'It's a disease that tends to go unrecognised because many people see the symptoms as a sign of being unfit or getting old,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Although COPD is typically common among those aged in their 60s, Dr Upham says there's an increasing number of younger patients suffering from the disease - in some cases needing a lung transplant.

'The numbers are definitely increasing because we're able to pick up COPD better and also people are living longer and exposed to more pollution,' he said.

'But also, these days, there's an increase of younger patients aged 40-50 years who are coming to me.'

A recent report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has revealed some of Australia's most COPD affected areas - most of which are remote parts of the nation.

The difference between a healthy lung and one that's affected by COPD - a chronic lung disease 

Dr Upham believes smoking plays a major role in why more regional areas have COPD.

'There are studies showing that poorly educated and lower income areas have higher rates of smoking,' he said.

'So it can be seen that in regional areas COPD is higher because there are more smokers and less access to facilities to help smokers quit their habits, which also prevents early detection of the lung disease.'

The AIHW study showed there were 59,265 hospitalisations for COPD from 2011 to 2012 among Australians aged 55 and over.

Dr Upham says this 'isn't an economically smart way' of dealing with the disease, which can be eased by medication if diagnosed early.

COPD cost the government about $929 million from 2008 to 2009. The majority of this cost was for patients admitted to hospital, according to the AIHW report.

'People can avoid hospitalisation if detected early but in most cases it's left too late so they need to be taken to through the emergency room,' Dr Upham said.

'Medication can help by slowing down the disease but cannot cure it. People have to live with it for the rest of their lives.'

In Ms Lewis's case, she has been taking Bretaris Genuair - a medication which has recently been reimbursed by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme - to help her with the symptoms during the morning and night.

Although she still faces limitations on a daily basis, Ms Lewis remains grateful for her daughter's quick observation eight years ago.

'Vanessa has been a godsend,' she said.

'She's always looking out for me.'
