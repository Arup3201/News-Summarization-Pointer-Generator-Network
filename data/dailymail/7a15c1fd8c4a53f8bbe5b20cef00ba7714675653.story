A Romanian Britain's Got Talent act who dazzled David Walliams last week allegedly owes £25,000 to a Eurovision singer for claiming they had a homosexual affair.

Semi-finalist Cristian Grigore Spiridon, 35, ended up in a Romanian civil court three years ago after he made false sex claims about Mihai Traistariu.

The singer, who controversially won David Walliams' Golden Buzzer pass on Saturday, made the claims in a local newspaper in his home country.

Claims: A Eurovision singer claims he successfully sued Britain's Got Talent act Cristian Grigore Spiridon (pictured) for £25,000 three years ago for claiming they had an affair

Semi-finalist: On Saturday, the Romanian singer won over David Walliams, who used his Golden Buzzer to put him through to the next round

A friend said: 'He admits he did it and now regrets his actions. As far as owing money, he says it's up to the newspaper to pay.'

According to the Daily Star, outraged Mihai, 34, denied he was gay and successfully sued Cristian, but never received the money.

Eurovision singer Mihai, who represented Romania in 2006, claims Cristian 'vanished' shortly after the civil case in 2011.

He told the Daily Star: 'He is a stupid, crazy "singer" who made my life hell.

'He told a big newspaper here he had a love story with me. I am not gay.

'I went to court and he had to pay me £25,000. But I never got it.'

Cristian progressed to the semi-finals last weekend after a fiery cover of Sex Bomb by Sir Tom Jones.

Despite
 damning criticism from Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and Simon Cowell - 
who branded Cristian a 'joke' - comedian David Walliams praised the 
performance, and put him through.

Mihai – a major star in Romania – said he was 'shocked' to read in the local newspaper, Cancan, that Cristian had claimed he was gay, as he says they met just once at a concert with 10 other performers.

He added: 'I never even said hello to him so I was shocked when he gave a newspaper story about me.'

Millions of viewers watched as Cristian
came one step closer to performing for the Queen at the Royal Variety Performance, despite failing to impress three of the judges.

Wannabe: Last year, Cristian appeared on The X Factor while wearing a pair of red underpants and no trousers, but he failed to impress the judges

Talent show star: Cristian previously appeared on Romania's Got Talent

His rendition of Sex Bomb, which Simon Cowell branded 'an appalling joke', came a year after his failed X Factor audition.

Wearing a pair of red underpants - and no trousers - Cristian sang Kylie Minogue's I Can't Get You Out Of My Head, and told judges he was already 'famous' in his native country.

But the panel was not impressed, and he was sent off.

MailOnline has contacted Britain's Got Talent for comment.
