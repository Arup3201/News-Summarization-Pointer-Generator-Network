There were ugly scenes in Los Angeles after Mexican soccer fans rocked cars and tossed bottles at riot police following their team's victory over Croatia in the World Cup.

Hundreds of fans poured into the streets of Huntingdon Park, California, after the match, with the majority celebrating peacefully, but the behavior of some got out of hand and the police were forced to step in.

In Pacoima, meanwhile, police were forced to close offramps and onramps on the 5 Freeway after scores of jubilant Mexican fans took to the streets.

The team beat Croatia 3-1 to advance 
from the group stage of the soccer tournament to the knockout round for 
the sixth World Cup in a row.

Fans poured into the streets of Huntingdon Park waiving Mexican flags and chanting while cars tried to navigate by.

The crowd quickly swelled to the point the road was blocked, and about 10 fans began rocking a white pickup truck, officials told KCBS. Some even hopped onto the vehicle.

Police on motorcycles and even horseback soon arrived to control the increasingly rowdy gathering.

A woman who threw a bottle was shown running from police. She was chased by officers on foot and motorcycle before eventually surrendering and being tackled by SWAT

She was one of four people arrested at the scene – two for public intoxication, one for failure to disperse, according to KTLA.

A local resident speaking to KCBS lamented the chaos.

‘Don’t disrespect, you know, buses and breaking stuff, breaking glass, throwing [bottles] and disrespecting the law,’ Priscila Bautista said. ‘That is not right.’

A police advisory issued just before 6.00 p.m. demanded the celebration break up immediately, but was likely not seen by the revelers.

‘Fans celebrating Mexico’s win are reminded to obey all laws,’ the police wrote on Nixle. ‘Pedestrians MUST stay out of the street.’

One of the fans partying in the street told KTLA ‘it was the best game ever.’

It took police more than two hours to finally bring the crowd under control and move it out of the busy street, according to KCBS.

The freeway ramp closures were put in place on Van Nuys Boulevard, Osborne Street and Terra Bella Street, according to the California Highway Patrol.

El Tri’s next World Cup match will be this Sunday. The team will face the Netherlands.

Mexico has reached the last 16 of every World Cup tournament since 1994.
