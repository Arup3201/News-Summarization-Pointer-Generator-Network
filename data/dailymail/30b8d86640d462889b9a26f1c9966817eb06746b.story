Britain's foreign aid budget is to be protected by law following a historic vote last night – but ministers still refused to protect funding for the armed forces.

The House of Lords voted to commit future governments to spending at least 0.7 per cent of national wealth – currently around £12billion a year – on overseas development.

The new law will come into force within the next few weeks, after it receives royal assent from the Queen.

Legislation forcing Britain to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid is set to become law tonight

Last night Tories lined up to lambast the move, saying it is wrong for aid spending to be protected when savage cuts to defence are expected after the election.

A defence think tank has warned that up to 30,000 members of the forces face redundancy over the next parliament. David Cameron has repeatedly refused to pledge that funding for the military will be kept above the Nato target of at least 2 per cent of GDP.

The 2013/14 defence budget was £34.3billion – just over this 2 per cent target and down from £35.9billion in 2010/11, when the coalition took over.

By contrast, the aid budget has soared from £8.5billion in 2010 to £11.5billion in 2013 – the year that the 0.7 per cent of gross national income was reached for the first time. When Margaret Thatcher left office, just 0.27 per cent of GNI went on aid.

Legislation to set the aid target in stone was passed by the Lords despite opposition from Tory grandees including former Chancellor Lord Lawson, who has described the measure as ‘gesture politics’.

Sir Gerald Howarth, the former Conservative defence minister, said aid spending should be cut to allow an increase in the defence budget – because Russia is increasing spending on arms and the Middle East is in flames.

Foreign aid spending rose to more than £11billion in 2013 as ministers moved to hit the 0.7% target

‘This is a dangerous world,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s World at One. ‘This is not a time to be cutting our defence in any case. If you ask me where you make the savings – you make them in overseas aid.’

More than 300 Tory backbenchers are expected to rebel on Thursday by forcing a Commons vote on enshrining the 2 per cent defence target in law.

Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘Most of my constituents would think ensuring the safety of this country is of greater importance than meeting the overseas aid budget.

‘If the Government is prepared to accept that a percentage of gross national income should go toward a specific priority, it seems crazy that we can do this for overseas aid but not for defence.

‘We should be putting the 2 per cent Nato target into law.’ The pledge to introduce the law was part of the coalition agreement of 2010 – but opposition from many Conservative backbenchers meant it never saw the light of day as an official government bill.

It had to be piloted through parliament by Liberal Democrat MP Michael Moore. It was approved in the Commons earlier this year and yesterday was given an unopposed third reading in the Lords.

n SACKED cabinet minister Andrew Lansley suffered fresh humiliation yesterday after being rejected for a top UN role that David Cameron is said to have promised him.

The former health secretary, who was demoted two years ago after his NHS reforms ran into trouble, was tipped to become the UN aid chief. But the job has gone to fellow Tory MP Stephen O’Brien, an ex-minister who will replace Valerie Amos as under-secretary for humanitarian affairs.
