Britain could be covered in foreign road signs if a controversial new scheme to standardise their design across Europe is brought in.

The UK’s distinctive red-circle speed signs and the ‘no-entry’ symbol as we know it could vanish.

Instead we could be made to adopt German and French-style signs, such as a number on a solid  red circle.

Halt! Britain could be covered in foreign road signs if a controversial new scheme to standardise designs across Europe is brought in

The changes for A-roads proposed to the European Commission last week are said to be needed to pave the way for ‘intelligent’ cars with cameras able to read road signs and talk to drivers. Some new Volvos and Fords already have the technology.

Now the European Road Assessment Programme (EuroRAP) and the independent crash-testing authority EuroNCAP argue that for the system to work effectively across Europe, all EU countries need to use the same signs

The RAC said the plan should be taken seriously and could create ‘a sensible new standard’.

But last night politicians called it ‘madness’ which would confuse motorists and waste millions.

And here's one we might find useful! There are, as far as we know, no plans to adopt this 'drunken people crossing' sign from Thailand

Eurosceptic Conservative MP Peter Bone said: ‘This is Europe gone mad again.

‘They want to waste British taxpayers’ money on something that won’t make a jot of difference. Nobody has any problems driving around Europe. Why should we all have exactly the same signs?

‘It will cost a lot of money and add a lot of confusion. They’re trying to solve a problem that doesn’t exist.’Tory MP Jason McCartney said predictions of cars reading signs sounded like Tomorrow’s World.

Meanwhile, road markings across Europe could also be standardised so that white lines along the edges of A-roads, particularly in rural areas, are a uniform 6in wide.

The plan  has raised fears among MPs and local authorities that thousands of miles of roads will need to be repainted, costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.

'Advanced driver assistance systems are already fitted to cars such as the Ford Kuga and Volvo S60.

Cameras recognise signs and transmit warnings to the dashboard... which is why the European bodies want a common ‘language’.

Mac McGuire, head of Highways at Cambridgeshire County Council, said: ‘At a time when local authorities are strapped for cash, this is not going to be a priority.’ The Campaign to Protect Rural England warned that new road markings and signs could pose a threat to some of the country’s most idyllic areas.

EuroRAP chairman John Dawson said: ‘The technology can stop deaths so you’ve got to start treating lane markings like they matter.’

The Department for Transport insisted the changes would not be implemented.
