A British sound engineer will be the real toast of the Academy Awards after films he worked on scooped almost sixty Oscar nominations.

Mark Crabtree, 60, is responsible for the sound mixing equipment used on dozens of top Hollywood movies.

These include five of the seven Best Picture nominations at this weekend's Oscars.

His company, AMS Neve, created 
ground-breaking audio mixing consoles which are a key part in the sound 
production on most big screen blockbusters.

Mark, of Burnley, Lancashire, spent 40 years developing the equipment.

It was used on Lincoln, Life of Pi, Les Miserables, Argo and Amour - which have all been nominated for film of the year.

His equipment was also a key part in the sound work in films nominated for Best Animated Feature, Best Original Score and Best Sound Mixing categories.

In total, the films he helped make have 59 Oscar nominations for Sunday's Oscars.

Mark can add these to the ten Golden Globes his movies won last month.

Mark said: 'It is fair to say rather more people know about us in Hollywood now than they do in Burnley.

'Our congratulations go out to all the exceptional talent winning and being nominated for these glittering prizes.

'All our staff and engineers are really 
proud and excited to be able to feature in this internationally 
recognised festive arena and to see Britain and of course Burnley, 
playing such a dominant part in the creation of these iconic films.'

Mark spent 40 years developing his recording consoles which cost half-a-million pounds each.

He and his team also produced Adele's smash hit Bond theme Skyfall, which is also hotly tipped to win Best Original Song.

Mark reckons that in recent years, more than 80 per cent of Oscar-winning films have used Mark Crabtree's advanced technology.
