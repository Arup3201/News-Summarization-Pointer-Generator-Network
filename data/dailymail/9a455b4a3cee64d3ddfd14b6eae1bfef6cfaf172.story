Vandals have spray painted the word 'evil' across the front of a 60-year-old mosque in a small town in far north Queensland.

Worshippers arrived at the mosque in Mareeba, inland from Cairns, on Friday morning to find their place of worship defaced with the yellow paint. 

Mareeba Mayor Tom Gilmore said the act was deeply saddening and the mosque had been part of the community since the 1950s.

'This is entirely unacceptable behaviour by anybody in this community,' he said soon after visiting the site on Friday.

'The thing that is deeply saddening is that it has been in this community since the mid-fifties.

'I don't think it's ever been defaced before in that time.'

Mr Gilmore said a large group of 'highly respected' Muslims had lived in the community since the 1920s.

He said the graffiti was visible from the street.
