Theresa May, the Home Secretary, tried to prevent the Ismail from being released but was overruled

A Somali criminal with a history of violence has been allowed to walk free today after a High Court judge ruled detaining him longer would breach his human rights.

Abdi Ismail, 33, has been convicted of a string of crimes since arriving in Britain in 1993, including  racially aggravated threatening behaviour and assault on police.

In 2011, he was sentenced to a 15-month jail term for assault and told he would be deported after attacking a friend with a knife.

But a High Court judge ruled today that the criminal had been detained for too long and ordered his release. A deportation hearing is expected to be held at a later date.

Home Office 'incompetence' was listed among the reasons behind the decision.

It is understood that Ismail is also planning to sue Britain over his treatment using Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Mrs Justice Lang said the Somali, who has two children, had to be freed due to Home Office "incompetence" and a poor standard of investigation by the UK Border Agency.

The Home Office's lack of 'due diligence' had prolonged his detention unreasonably, the judge added.

Ismail was detained for a total of 18 months and was held pending deportation following a conviction for assault.

Under
 the 2007 Borders Act, those from outside the EU sentenced to at least a
 year in jail should face automatic deportation to their home country.

A bid by Theresa May, the Home Secretary, to continue to detain him further failed.

The 33 year-old arrived in the United Kingdom in 1993 after members of his family fled to escape civil war in Somalia.

He worked in a variety of jobs, married and fathered two children but later divorced. He lived in London and Leicestershire.

In the decade since arriving, he was convicted of a string of crimes, including racially-aggravated threatening behaviour and assault on police.

Home Office officials decided to deport him after he attacked a friend with a knife, was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and given a 15-month jail term by a judge at Harrow Crown Court in 2011.

The judge said Mr Ismail had claimed damages for false imprisonment, arguing that his detention was unlawful and he had been denied a fair right to liberty.

But she made no decisions about any compensation award in the ruling.

The Home Officeâ€™s initial decision to detain was justified, she added. But she concluded that investigations should have been completed within a year and Mr Ismail had been held too long.

'It was prolonged for an unreasonably long period as a result of (Home Office) incompetence, neglect and failure to show due diligence,' the judge said in a written ruling.

'(He has) been in immigration detention for 18 months. There is likely to be a further delay of at least a year before the deportation appeal process is concluded.

'These are lengthy periods of time which, having regard to the risk of re-offending and absconding, I do not consider are justified.'

Mrs Justice Lang said Mr Ismail should 
be released subject to residence and reporting conditions and fitted 
with a monitoring tag pending rulings on his deportation.
