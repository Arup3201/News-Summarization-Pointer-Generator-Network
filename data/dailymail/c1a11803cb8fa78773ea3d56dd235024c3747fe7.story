Gammon joints, parmesan and coffee may not sound like the kind of essentials that would drive the desperate to theft. 

But they are now among the items most frequently stolen from the high street – as middle Britain goes shoplifting to maintain its lifestyle. 

The problem of food theft is becoming so serious that many supermarkets are introducing electronic security tags to deter thieves from pinching products such as turkey and steak.

Targets: Gammon joints and Nescafe Gold Blend coffee are among the items most frequently stolen from the high street - as middle Britain goes shoplifting to maintain its lifestyle

According to the latest Global Retail Theft Barometer, the total cost of retail theft has hit £3.4billion, or £124.60 per household – which is passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

And the goods most likely to be stolen include gammon joints, frozen chicken breasts, beef joints, bacon, gourmet cheese such as brie or parmesan, Nescafe Gold Blend coffee and wines and spirits, particularly Glen’s Vodka.

One Tesco store has even found it necessary to put manuka honey, which can sell for as much as £20 a jar, into large plastic security boxes to deter the sticky-fingered thieves of Cambridge.

In the health and beauty section, razor 
blades, mascara, lipsticks, perfume, skin care, sun protection, hair 
straighteners, electric toothbrushes and sports nutrition are at the top
 of the thief’s wish list.

DIY and home improvement stores, meanwhile, are most likely to lose power tools, cables, batteries and door locks.

The theft barometer report, compiled by analysts Euromonitor and funded by retail security firm Checkpoint Systems, said: ‘A key observation from the grocery retailers interviewed was an increase in food theft … including items such as fresh meat, owing to the weak economy.’

Russell Holland of Checkpoint Systems 
said: ‘We know that, due to the recession, people are stealing out of 
need for food, but you also have a Middle England group of people who 
have not had a bonus or pay rise but still want to maintain their 
lifestyle.

‘Really, there is no longer a typical person described as a shoplifter, they can come from all walks of life. You can see the profile of people involved by looking at the products that are being stolen.’

Marks & Spencer now routinely puts electronic security tags on its turkey crowns ahead of Christmas, while Tesco and Sainsbury’s have given store managers authority to tag the birds if their outlet is in a theft hot spot.

The tags are designed to set off an alarm if a shopper tries to leave without paying.

Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research in Nottingham, said: ‘More people are stealing and they are stealing more.’
