A man who was run over as a child was stunned when his barber found and pulled out a stitch that had been in his head - for 52 years.

Dave Graystock, 60, was having his regular trim when his barber Kevin Gavaghan discovered the stitch poking out of his client’s head.

The thread is believed to have been in his head since he suffered injuries when he was run over by a school delivery van in 1961 at the age of eight.

A man who went for a haircut has revealed how his barber pulled out a stitch that had been in his head - for 52 years

A young Mr Graystock in hospital at the time of the accident. Due to complications he spent 10 months in hospital. Right, the stitch that was in Mr Graystock's head for five decaded

The stitch hasn’t been visible for over half-a-century and Mr Graystock, of Gomersal, West Yorkshire, assumed the tiny lump on his head was scar tissue until the barber spotted the stitch and pulled it clean out.

He said: 'Kevin’s cut my hair for 19 years and has always avoided that area because he felt something. I thought it was scar tissue.

'It took me a while to figure out where on earth the stitch had come from.

'But later that night it hit me like a sledgehammer. I've no idea how this stitch got missed.

'I think Kev must have pulled the 
hair a bit further back, followed the scar up with his finger and 
noticed this bit of stitch poking out.

'He said to me "you've got a stitch in your head" and he asked if I wanted him to snip it and pull it out.'

Mr Graystock suffered a fractured leg and skull after being run over by a delivery van at Dewsbury Moor school.

Conscious, he tried to crawl away - but the driver thought he was under the wheels and reversed onto him.

He
 said: 'I ran straight into him - he couldn’t stop. I never met him, but
 if I did I’d shake his hand. It must have been horrendous.'

I couldn’t have anaesthetic because of the head injury. They had
 to get glass out of my skull. It was horrible - they had to hold me 
down.'

The retired painter and 
decorator said that the scar on his head was approximately a 
quarter-inch long and used to be sensitive.

'The bump had always felt weird but I just dismissed it,' he said.

'I'd had a lot of bumps and bangs through the years and didn't think anything of that particular scar.

'I'm
 not angry about it, though - I'm laughing about it really. I think the 
whole thing's pretty funny - one that's guaranteed to get people in 
stitches anyway.'

While recovering he developed a rash and was kept in isolation for two weeks.He had the stitches taken out but now realises medics missed one.

He was diagnosed with bone disease osteomyelitis following his injuries. After an emergency operation he ended up missing 10 months of school.

He explained: 'A nurse called Lyons came to see me every day, even is she wasn’t working. I thought the world of her.

'It’d be nice if she was still around.'

Eventually Mr Graystock recovered and forgot about his ordeal. He said: 'I’ve had a few bangs on my head over the years but I’ve never had any other serious injuries. The nit nurse used to come to school to check us, obviously she didn’t look very carefully.

'It’s the strangest thing that’s ever happened to me.'

Barber Kevin Gavaghan, who runs Up the Junction barbers in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, said: 'In this job you come across quite a few things but nothing quite as odd as this.'

Mr Graystock is married to Sue, 57, and they are due to celebrate their 38th wedding anniversary next week.

They have one son together, Chris, 29.

He added: 'It would be fantastic if either the nurse who looked after me or the driver who ran me over were still alive. It would be great to speak to them again.'
