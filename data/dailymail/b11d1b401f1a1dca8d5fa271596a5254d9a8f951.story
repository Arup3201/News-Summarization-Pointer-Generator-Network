A woman who threw a kettle of boiling water at her boyfriend's groin after she claimed he had slept with her daughter has been jailed.

Helen Corbett was made the subject of a restraining order after she she pleaded guilty to the assault but the following day she was back at her partner's property and taken into custody.

Judge John Evans told the court that he was going to release Corbett, 45, but he believed that would be 'setting her up to fail'.

Corbett missed 46-year-old Peter Bailey's private parts with the water but caused serious burns to his thighs which left his skin peeling off when she attacked him in April this year.

Mr Bailey has forgiven Corbett for the gruesome attack and says he still loves her.

He added: 'We both still love each other. Helen has sent me letters from prison and she has recently gave me a card telling me how much she still wants to be with me.

'I will always keep that card close by. We want to move on from the incident and be together.'

Corbett, 45, had heard rumours Mr Bailey was sleeping with her 24-year-old daughter Crystal.

Prosecutor Neil Pallister told Newcastle Crown Court: 'The defendant was angry with him because she believed he had slept with her daughter.

'He was in the doorway, she was shouting at him "have you slept with my daughter".

'He heard the kettle click.

'She said "I will show you how mad I am", picked up the kettle, and threw boiling water towards him.

'He recalls she was aiming for his groin.'

Mr Bailey suffered a large burn to his left thigh.

Mr Bailey admitted that after he was released from hospital he then slept with Corbett's daughter Crystal claiming he was 'stupid' and made a 'mistake'

In a victim impact statement read to the court at an earlier hearing Mr Bailey said: 'I cannot believe what Helen did to me.

'Since the incident I have been in a great deal of pain, I have struggled to sleep, I have flashbacks of what she did.

'I loved Helen, although we had our ups and downs.

'I didn't expect her to do that to me.

'Helen hurt me, both physically and emotionally. Every time I see my scar I think about what she did.

'It will be a lifelong reminder.'

Corbett, formerly of Portmeads Rise, Birtley, Gateshead, admitted causing grievous bodily harm at a previous hearing.

Sue Hirst, defending, told the court how Corbett was remanded in custody after being caught at Bailey's house in Portmeads Rise, Birtley, Gateshead, thus breaking her bail conditions.

Judge John Evans told Miss Hurst: 'This relationship is unhealthy to put it mildly.'

He added: 'They are bad for each other and there is no point releasing her just for her to be arrested again.

'If she is not going to help herself then there is no point.'

Judge Evans adjourned today's sentencing to give probation workers the opportunity to find somewhere for Corbett to live if she were to be released, but unfortunately nowhere could be arranged.

Judge Evans called the situation 'disastrous'.

He said: 'This is a very unhappy state of affairs but it is the reality.

'You have been in custody for just over five months.

'In terms of your choice of partners, it has left a lot to be desired and in the future I see you running into more trouble if you're not more discerning about who you choose to live with.

'I was minded to impose a restraining order limiting your ability to return to your ex-partner, but I'm not going to set you up to fail, I am going to impose a prison sentence.

'I hope that when you are released accommodation will be found for you away from the complainant.

'Your drinking is a really serious problem, you have got to make a decision to help yourself.'

Judge Evans sentenced Corbett to 15 months in prison and ordered her to pay a £100 victim surcharge.

Mr Bailey, pictured, said he does not want Corbett banned from contacting him, claiming that they both have made mistakes: 'I have forgiven her knowing that she has also forgiven me', he added, 'I love her to bits'

But speaking from his home in Birtley, Gateshead, said: 'Helen had a moment of madness when she scolded me, she thought that I had slept with her daughter, Crystal but that was completely false.

'I was in so much pain, I have scars on my legs but I would take her back.

'When Helen was in prison and once I came out of hospital, Crystal came over to see me when I was in bed.

'She said that everyone was blaming us any way so we may as well sleep together, so we did. She only came over because she wanted to persuade me and I fell for it.

'I was stupid and I made a mistake.

'I know Helen has also done wrong but don't I want her to be banned from contacting me.

'I have forgiven her knowing that she has also forgiven me.

'We want to move on as a couple as I love her to bits and I know we both respect each other now.'
