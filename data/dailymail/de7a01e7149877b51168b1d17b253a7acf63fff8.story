A Norwegian TV show, broadcast by the country's equivalent to the BBC, follows local celebrities as they plan their own funeral.

The Coffin sees presenter Namra Saleem speak to six famous names about how they would like to see their (hypothetical) final hurrah go down.

Ms Saleem visits celebrities with a blank wooden coffin which the guest is the allowed to decorate while the pair discuss death and funerals.

Producer Gelting Andresen describes The Coffin as ‘a feel-good programme about death’, each episode ending with the celebrity guest watching their decorated coffin being cremated.

‘People will hopefully feel that they are better acquainted with the guests and discover aspects of them they had not known,’ Andresen said.

The first programme, set to premiere on government-funded channel NRK next week, features Bjarne Brondbo, the lead singer of Norwegian rock band D.D.E.

Mr Brodbo is filmed being driven around by Ms Saleem as they discuss his funeral, before he decorates the coffin he would like to be cremated in.

‘It is very strange to see the coffin here,’ he says. ‘At the age of almost 50 years, you do start to think a little that life has an end.’  

‘According to my wife, I think I'm immortal. Actually, I'm terrified of dying, and that's why I try to live.’  

'Feel-good funeral': Celebrities such as musician Bjarne Brøndbo are invited to decorate their coffin before a cremation ceremony in a show which has been described as 'feel-good' by the producer

Another guests on the show is  bassist and main songwriter in the band Turbonegro, Thomas Seltzer

The singer decorates his coffin with the inscription ‘Rai Rai’, a reference to D.D.E.’s first album, as well as the names of several members of his family, including his mother.

‘My wish is that people should not be so very sad at my funeral,’ he says.

‘Afterwards, I hope that people meet to share stories over dinner, wine, coffee and brandy.’

NRK has developed an international reputation for its series of 'Slow TV' programmes, starting in 2009 with centenary of the Bergen railway line.

Rather than commission a conventional feature programme on the line, NRK instead decided to stick a camera on a train and broadcast the entire seven-hour trip from Oslo to Bergen, interweaving archive footage to liven up the programme.

Remarkably, it was a roaring success, with 1.2 million viewers, nearly a quarter of the population of Norway, tuning in for at least part of the trip.

Since then, the network has broadcast a cruise journey, a fire being slowly built and burned, and more recently, the knitting of a jumper - starting with the sheep from which the wool came.
