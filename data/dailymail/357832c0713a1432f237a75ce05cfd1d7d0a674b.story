A RAF Hawk jet taking part in a training exercise has crashed after hitting a goose.

The plane, carrying an instructor and student pilot, was practising a forced touchdown when it ran into the path of the unlucky bird.

It overshot the runway and smashed into a barrier, before landing in a safety net.

Unlucky: The unfortunate bird caused the plane to overshoot the runway and smash into a barrier, before landing in a safety net

The crash, which has incredibly left both instructor and pupil unscathed, happened at Mona airfield in mid-Anglesey at 10.50am yesterday.

The strip, which is used by trainee pilots, is based at Valley RAF station a few miles away - the same base where Prince William worked as a rescue helicopter pilot until this week.

The Hawk T1 plane, powered by a Rolls-Royce turbofan engine, is used by trainee pilots to practise takeoffs and touchdowns.

It first entered service with the RAF in 1976, both as an advanced flying-training aircraft and a weapons-training aircraft.

Today, the all-metal, low-wing aircraft is used at the Valley base for fast-jet pilot advanced flying training.

It is also used by RAF Aerobatic Team and the Red Arrows.

A Defence Ministry spokesman said: 'The aircraft was carrying out a practice forced landing. When on the runway, it hit a bird and went into the barrier.'

It isn't the first time a stray animal has caused an aircraft potentially deadly problems.

In 2010, a plane crashed after an escaped crocodile wreaked havoc on board - killing a British co-pilot and 19 others.

The small plane was thrown off balance by a stampede of passengers trying to avoid the reptile.
