Spain coach Vicente del Bosque is considering making changes to his line-up for Wednesday's World Cup Group B game against Chile after analysing the 5-1 humiliation at the hands of Holland.

The defending champions head to the Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro needing not only a win but also a vastly-improved performance after being torn apart by the Dutch.

Del Bosque has now taken the time to study that defeat and admits he may switch some players around, although he refused to play the blame game.

Tinkerman: Spain coach has hinted that he could make changes for the game against Chile

'There may be some changes,' Del Bosque said. 'However, we don't want to rush into things.

'If I made a change, it wouldn't be to point the finger at someone.

'This is a short tournament and we would look to find the best solution.'

Del Bosque is reluctant, however, to replace goalkeeper Iker Casillas despite his woeful display against the Dutch, which the national team captain described as the worst game of his career.

'As always Casillas has given proof of his captaincy and his commitment to the national team,' Del Bosque said.

'I remember when I came back to the changing room after the press conference, he was talking to his team-mates, acting as a captain.'

Spain have faced criticism for bringing some players that were in the World Cup-winning side of 2010, with many not having been in top form in the 2013-14 campaign.

Three Barcelona players in particular have been called into question: Gerard Pique, Xabi Hernandez and Jordi Alba.

However, Del Bosque insists that everyone who has travelled to Brazil deserved to do so.

'We have brought 16 of our 23 players that are world champions,' he said. 'They have taken part in qualifying and have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League and done well in La Liga.

'We have brought them because we are convinced that they are the best, even if others may have a different opinion.

'We do have seven new players.'

All of the coaches that have so far tasted defeat in their World Cup openers have stressed the need to look forward and not to dwell on the result.

Yet the way Spain collapsed against the Dutch will not be forgotten any time soon by anyone connected to the squad.

We knew Holland were going to be a permanent danger and we weren't able to stop them," Del Bosque said.

'We are badly accustomed to always having the result in our favour. We have to be prepared to face adversity but it's not easy. Against Holland we got a painful punishment.

We are sportsmen and we have no choice but to lift ourselves up. We have to fight in the next game which is our aim. We need to accept defeat with patience and tranquillity.

'This is what I've tried to transmit to the team.'

Del Bosque's team defeated Chile 2-1 in the group stages of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, having lost their opener against Switzerland 1-0.

The difference this time, however, is that Spain are coming off their worst ever result in the competition.

'We have enough experience,' Del Bosque said, 'and we have to combat their way of playing because Chile are a team that puts a lot of dangerous pressure.'
