California is at risk of losing its youthful image as the state is struggling with a declining rate of child birth.

Paired with a large number of ‘babyboomers’ expected to retire, and reduced migration, the state’s prosperity is at risk

In 1970, children made up 33 per cent of California’s population, a number which is expected to shrink to just over a fifth by 2030, a report by the University of Southern California shows.

Not enough: Childbirth in California is now below the 'replacement rate' and it is threatening future social and economic prosperity, the study said

This means that the world’s eight
largest economy - and the most populous state in the U.S. - is going to 
have to get busy.

The study showed that a child born today will have 
twice the social responsibility of a person born in 1985.

With childbirth shrinking 
significantly in all major ethnic and racial groups since 2000, the 
state has now slipped below the ‘replacement rate’ of 2.1 babies per 
woman of childbearing age.

And with the ‘babyboom’ 
generation set to retire, there are not enough children born to fulfill the space they leave as taxpayers.

In 1970, California averaged about 21 
seniors per 100 working age adults. By 2030, that number is predicted to
rise to 36 per cent of working age adults.

Aging population: Low birthrate and increasing numbers retirees means California may struggle to care for its elderly in the future

‘These trends are not yet widely 
recognized, but they should be a wake-up call for policymakers,’ said 
Professor Dowell Myers, report author and director of the Population 
Dynamics Research Group at University of Southern California.

‘We will be increasingly dependent 
economically and socially on a smaller number of children.

'They are more
important to the state’s future success than ever before.'

Homemade: As a result of the falling numbers of immigrants 90 per cent of Californian children under 10 were born in the state

The report said this demographic shift mirrors those in other states, including New York, Illinois, Michigan and Massachusetts.

Although a diverse state, over half of
children in California are of Hispanic or Latino origin, immigration to
the state had been declining since the early 90s and is expected to 
continue to go down for the foreseeable future.

Over 90 per cent of the children under the age of 10 in the state were born in California.

‘The majority of the next generation 
of workers will have been shaped by California’s health and education 
systems,’  professor Myers said. ‘It’s essential that we nurture our 
human capital.’
