Two men accused of the rape and murder of four prostitutes while on parole face the possible death penalty after a grand jury in California agreed to send them forward for trial.  

Steven Dean Gordon, 45 and Franc Cano, 28, both of Anaheim, California were both indicted by the grand jury in Orange County for four felony counts of special circumstances murder during the commission of rape, kidnapping, lying in wait and multiple rape. They also face four felony counts of forcible rape. 

According to the Orange County District Attorney's Office, both men, upon conviction face a minimum sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

Gordon and Cano were on parole at the time of the crimes and were wearing GPS tracking devices.  

The DA's office confirmed that the grand jury heard testimony from 16 witnesses over a three-day period before returning the indictment on the fourth day. 

Both men are expected back in court later today. They have been in custody since their arrest in April.  

Prosecutors say Cano and Gordon worked together to sexually assault and kill the California women while the men were wearing the tracking devices ordered after prior sex crimes.

The monitoring systems helped investigators link the pair to the slayings earlier this year after the body of Jarrae Nykkole Estepp was found at an Anaheim household waste recycling facility.

Messages were left for the men's attorneys seeking comment. Gordon and Cano were expected to be arraigned Friday in Orange County Superior Court.

The case has raised questions about the effectiveness of GPS devices and other forms of parole supervision in tracking offenders and deterring them from committing new crimes.

Parole records show the men had escaped supervision together before. 

In 2010, Cano cut off his GPS device and fled to Alabama, where he was arrested with Gordon. The two were arrested in Las Vegas two years later after cutting off their ankle bracelets, according to court records and state officials.

In addition to Estepp, the men are charged with killing Kianna Jackson, 20; Josephine Monique Vargas, 34; and Martha Anaya, 28, last autumn in Santa Ana. 

Authorities searched for the bodies of the three women for months but gave up in August, saying it was unlikely they'd ever find them because too much time had passed.
