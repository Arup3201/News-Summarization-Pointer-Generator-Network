Damaging: Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed yesterday inflicted a bruising legal defeat on the Home Office - six months after going on the run in a burka

An Al Qaeda trained terror suspect yesterday inflicted a bruising legal defeat on the Home Office - six months after going on the run in a burka.

Using legal aid, lawyers for Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed won a ruling that his control order should be quashed.

But, given the fanatic is believed to have long since fled the country, he is unlikely to learn of his ‘victory’.

A fellow extremist, known only as CF, was also successful in having his order quashed - despite the fact that it had already lapsed.

The case was allowed to grind on through the courts, at huge expense to the UK taxpayer, on a point of principle.

The men’s lawyers say it was unfair that, when the original instruction to place them under a control order was upheld three years ago, they were not fully told the reasons why.

Some of the explanation was given in secret.

The Court of Appeal unanimously ruled the men should have been told at least the “gist” of the allegations against them and said their cases must be reconsidered.

But Lord Justice Maurice Kay said judges had expressed doubts about allowing Mohamed’s case to proceed, once he disappeared from a mosque in west London last November.

Yesterday’s judgment said: ‘We did wonder whether his appeal should be stayed in these circumstances.

‘However, we were told that, although the legal aid authorities had initially withdrawn his funding on being informed of the position by his legal representatives, an adjudication subsequently reinstated it.

‘In these circumstances, and in view of the fact that CF’s appeal would be proceeding in any event, the (Home Secretary) decided not to invite us to stay or dismiss Mohamed’s appeal.

‘With some reluctance, we allowed it to proceed.’ The Home Office said it was ‘disappointed’ by the verdict.

Lawyers claim it could have implications for other cases where the government relies on secret evidence and refuses to confirm or deny claims made by terror suspects.

However, the control order regime is now
 defunct and its replacement - T-Pims - is not currently in operation 
against any suspect.

In a separate case, Mohamed and CF are demanding up to £1million in compensation from the taxpayer in yet another human rights fiasco.

Mohamed - linked to the murderous Al-Shabaab gang - was detained in Somaliland on suspicion of being overseas to receive terror training and plot attacks against western interests.

His lawyers claim he was ill-treated by his Somaliland interrogators with the knowledge of British security agents.
