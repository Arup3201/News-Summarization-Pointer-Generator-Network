A woman is claiming to have found a mouse floating in her spinach after emptying the contents of a sealed tray of Taylor Fresh's baby organic variety directly into an empty pot.

Miliica Calovic from Orlando, Florida, told reporters recently that at first she didn't notice the dead rodent but on spotting the 'hairy' pest among the leaves, knew straight away what it was.

The biologist claims the box was sealed before she cut it open and dumped it into the pot, taking her cue from the 'washed and ready to eat' announcement on the label. 

Eek: An Orlando biologist claims she emptied a sealed box of organic spinach into a pot of boiling water before noticing a dead rodent floating among the leaves

Minutes after the startling discover she and her husband grabbed a camera to record the evidence before contacting the Costco from where they purchased the salad, Taylor Farms and local and federal health agencies. 

Speaking to Orlando's Local 6, who caught wind of the story, she recalled how nauseated she felt as she spooned the mouse out of the spinach.

Hairy situation: Miliica Calovic says she emptied the contents of her Taylor Fresh Baby Organic Spinach into a pot to cook thankfully not eating it raw as she normally does

Warning: Though a spokesman for Taylor Farms insists she hasn't proven the mouse was actually in the box and the sorting process is methodical, Mrs Calovic says she only wants to tell others to wary of the 'dangers'

'I was just thinking, what if I had eaten it raw? What would have happened?' She asked.

Though
she has no plans to sue, Mrs Calovic, a vegetarian, says she only wants
people to be more careful about what they eat and remain 'aware of the 
dangers'.

Guarantee: Taylor Farms prides themselves on their washing methods and a spokesman said the sorting process made it 'extremely unlikely' a mouse could have slipped into the box

Taylor Farms'
website proclaims it prides itself on its state of the art
'Triple Washed' technology at the processing facility.

A food safety blurb reads:
'At Taylor Farms we maintain the highest standards for Food Safety.

'Through technology, research and innovation we are constantly working 
towards new solutions to ensure we are providing the safest, highest 
quality value-added products that you and your family have come to 
expect from Taylor Farms.'

A spokesman for the company, Mark 
Campion, told Local 6 that Mrs Calovic was unable to provide any proof 
that the mouse had been in the box of sealed spinach.

The sorting process, he explained, is rigorous and thorough relying on both an optical and manual sorter, and it was 'extremely unlikely' that a mouse could have gone undetected.

Though he also admitted that 'it's not impossible', he insisted that there were no signs of contamination in this batch and no other complaints had been filed.

But this isn't the first time this year Taylor Farms have had trouble with contaminated produce.

In May, three types of organic spinach shipped from the company to distributors between the 9th and 10th were recalled following a threat of Salmonella.
