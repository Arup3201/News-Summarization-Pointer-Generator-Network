Re-live all the drama here 

Radamel Falcao celebrated his season-long loan move to Manchester United by spending some of his £280,000-a-week wages on a Chinese meal and some red wine.

The Colombian forward completed his £6million loan deal in the early hours of Tuesday morning after the Old Trafford club held off competition from Arsenal and Manchester City for his signature.

Falcao posted a picture on his Twitter account with agent Jorge Mendes and his lawyers, Paulo Rendeiro and Carlos Osorio, enjoying a glass of wine, some prawn crackers and a Chinese meal at Wing's restaurant in Manchester - a regular haunt for both United and CIty players.

Arrived: Falcao turns up at United's training ground on Monday evening as the window comes to a close

Familiar face: Falcao was part of the Monaco side that played Arsenal in the Emirates Cup in pre-season

River Plate (2005-09): 105 apps/45 goals

Porto (2009-12): 87 apps/72 goals

Atletico Madrid (2011-13): 91 apps/70 goals

Monaco (2013-14): 22 apps/13 goals

Colombia: 51 caps/20 goals

United will pay Falcao £280,000-a-week after luring the player from the tax haven of Monaco and the Colombian will don the No 9 shirt at Old Trafford this season.

Robin van Persie has been struggling with a succession of niggling injuries and that convinced Louis van Gaal and the Old Trafford hierarchy to make a move for the free-scoring Falcao.

Since making his debut for River Plate in 2005, Falcao has scored an incredible 200 goals in 305 appearances for the Argentine club, Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco.

He has also netted 20 times in 51 international caps for Colombia but was ruled out of the 2014 World Cup after rupturing his cruciate knee ligament in January.

Why Wing's?

Wing's is a popular and fairly upmarket Chinese restaurant in Lincoln Square in Manchester.

Plenty of footballers and their WAGs visit Wing's for a Chinese meal, as do other North-West celebrities. 

In the blurb on its own website, Wing's describes itself as: 'One of the very few 5-star restaurants in Manchester city centre conveniently located close to Albert Square in the centre of the city. It offers the finest Cantonese cuisine and a large range of wines from around the world in a plush and comfortable environment. We pride ourselves in offering a personal and attentive service to all customers.'

Popular haunt: Wing's restaurant in Manchester offers Chinese food and is regularly visited by celebrities

Which other celebrities go there? 

Wing's is a popular haunt for both Manchester United and Manchester City stars alike, with players regularly enjoying some down time at the Lincoln Square restaurant.

Wayne and Coleen Rooney are two of most regular attendees, but Ashley and Cheryl Cole were also spotted in the restaurant during their time together.

Fame: Wayne and Coleen Rooney, as well as Cheryl and Ashley Cole, have visited Wing's restaurant 

Who is the owner?

Wing Shing Chu owns the restaurant.

He used to worked in Manchester's Chinatown before moving to Cheadle Hulme, near Stockport, and opening a Wing's restaurant there.

He was so successful, however, that he left his wife in charge of that establishment and opened his flagship restaurant in the city centre!

What are the prices like?

There is an extensive a la carte menu, but there are also two set banquet options coming in at £30.90 or £44.90 per person.

Banquet B at £44.90 per person offers:

Starter - Steamed scallop in shell with garlic and glass vermicelli. 

Second course - Baked lobster with ginger and spring onions.

Main courses - Crispy chilli shredded fillet steak, steamed sea bass with ginger and spring onions in soya sauce, quick-fried sea treasures (monk-fish fillet, scallops and king prawns), stir-fried king prawns and Chinese greens, as well as pak far roasted duck, all served with mixed seafood fried rice.

Dessert - Fresh fruit platter.

What is the dress code? 

The Wing's management 'kindly request for smart dress at all times (i.e. no trainers, sandals, shorts, casual sportswear)'.

So Falcao cannot be turning up straight from training full in his kit, unfortunately. 

Formal: Customers are asked to wear 'smart dress at all times' at Wings, here is the bar at the restaurant

How much food could Falcao afford on his £280,000-a-week wages? 

Falcao could afford to order 6,236 meals per week and still have £3.60 left over - for his bus fare home if necessary!

'Manchester United is the biggest club in the world and is clearly determined to get back to the top.

'I am looking forward to working with Louis van Gaal and contributing to the team’s success at this very exciting period in the club’s history.' 

The striker could make his debut against former Old Trafford favourite Rio Ferdinand a week on Sunday when United face Queens Park Rangers at home.

In the mean time, Falcao will represent Colombia against Brazil on Saturday morning UK time and Ecuador next Tuesday.

Falcao is currently staying at The Lowry hotel in Manchester, along with fellow signings Daley Blind, Luke Shaw, Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo.

Concern: United signed Falcao amid fears that Robin van Persie (right) is suffering from niggling injuries

£147.1m - Amount spent by United in the summer transfer window, more than any other team in the country

200 - Goals scored by Falcao during his club career

£10m - United’s net spend this summer is around £10million higher than Jose Mourinho’s entire net spend in his two spells at Chelsea

7 - United have signed seven players this summer, the most in one window since the summer of 2007

0.66 - Falcao’s goals per game rate in his club career, much better than the PL’s top strikers.

Aguero 0.48, Van Persie 0.47, Rooney 0.45, Dzeko 0.44, Giroud 0.42, Sturridge 0.39, Balotelli 0.39, Costa 0.38

Van Gaal welcomed a player he used on the left side of Holland’s defence at the World Cup but is more likely to deploy as a holding midfielder at United.

‘I am delighted Daley has signed for the club,’ said Van Gaal. ‘He is a very intelligent and versatile footballer who can play in many positions. Daley is a great reader of the game and he has played under my philosophy over a number of years.’

Falcao’s arrival meant striker Danny Welbeck was allowed to join rivals Arsenal in a £16m deal, while Javier Hernandez went to Real Madrid on a season-long loan, with an option for a £16m permanent move.
