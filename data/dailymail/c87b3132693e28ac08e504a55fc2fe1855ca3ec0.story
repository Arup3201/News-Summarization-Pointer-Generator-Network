A Labour MP today defied his wife, daughters and party bosses and refused to apologise after telling former Tory politician Louise Mensch to ‘shut up’.

Austin Mitchell sparked a furious storm on Twitter after criticising author Mrs Mensch for contradicting her husband over why she quit the Commons last month.

The Grismby MP tweeted: ‘Shut up Menschkin. A good wife doesn't disagree with her master in public and a good little girl doesn't lie about why she quit politics.’

Defiant Labour MP Austin Mitchell today refused to withdraw his tweets that Louise Mensch should should 'shut up' and remember 'A good wife doesn't disagree with her master in public'

Ms Mensch has insisted she resigned from her Corby seat for family reasons, saying she was ‘struggling’ to balance her parliamentary work and family life when she resigned in the summer.

But veering wildly off message, Peter Mensch said in a newspaper interview that she stepped down because she feared she would never be promoted to minister and would ‘get killed’ by Labour in the next General Election.

Mrs Mensch then took Twitter to deny his side of the story.  She also reposted a message  from one of her followers on the site  who suggested Mr Mensch ‘might be in for  a b******ing’.

Today Mr Mitchell weighed in with the tweet criticising Mrs Mensch.

Mr Mitchell tweeted today telling Ms Mensch she was wrong to contradict her husband

After being bombarded with criticism from Twitter users, a defiant Mr Mitchell revealed his wife had banned him from tweeting again

But he was soon back to insist he would not withdraw the offending tweet, despite being told to do so by his wife, children and Labour party press advisers

After being bombarded with abuse from other users, he added: ‘Calm down dears. Irony may be a low form of wit but it's clearly above my level. And yours. So my wife has banned me from tweeting today.’

And as the row refused to go away he revealed he had been told by Labour HQ and his to withdraw the remark.

‘Wife, three daughters, one granddaughter and Labour press office all demand that I withdraw my tweet.No chance of front bench now.’

A Labour source said: 'Austin Mitchell has made clear the tweet was a joke, not a serious comment. It's not funny, understandable that people find it offensive, and it is not the view of the Labour Party.'

Mr Mitchell later insisted he 'loved' Mrs Mensch and suggested the message should be taken as a joke.

He said: ‘It was ironic. I'm surprised that people have taken it so negatively. What happened to humour?"

Mrs Mensch took to the site to respond to Mr Mitchell and demanded a 'a repudiation from Ed Miliband'.

She added: 'My husband is my partner. And it's 2012. Feminism.'

A month ago Mrs Mensch moved to New York, 
where her music mogul husband is based, with her three children from her
first marriage, in an attempt to ‘keep [her family] together’.

Clash: Louise Mensch has been forced to deny allegations made by her husband Peter in a newspaper interview that she quit her role as an MP because she didn't think she would win at the next election

Mr Mensch, 59, who manages rock acts 
including Def Leppard and Metallica, said in yesterday's newspaper interview: ‘The problem
was any number of issues.

'Number one, Louise’s ex-husband is American 
and has moved back there.

'Then there was my business.

‘Then there was Louise’s belief that 
she was only going to be an MP for three more years.

'She thought – and I
wasn’t going to argue with her – that she’d get killed in the next 
election.

'So, to her, it seemed much more short-term than my job as a 
manager.

‘And listen, they hadn’t promoted her
yet, and it’s not like she thought she had a future because perhaps she
felt she was too outspoken.’

Denying her husband’s claims, Mrs 
Mensch wrote on Twitter: ‘Nothing, repeat nothing, influenced decision 
to resign other than inability to hold family life together away from 
him.

‘Can honestly say I had no fear whatsoever of defeat at next election since had already decided not to stand again.’ But she conceded that her husband ‘doesn’t do on-message and I love him for it’.

One of the so-called ‘Cameron 
cuties’, Mrs Mensch won the Corby seat for the Conservatives in 2010 
after it had been in Labour hands for 13 years.

Labour is expected to 
regain the seat in next month’s by-election which was triggered by her 
departure.

This summer she announced she would be relocating to New York with her three children, where her husband is based.

Her sudden departure, three years before the next election has gone down badly with her party, and she was booed and heckled when she appeared on a film screen at the Conservative party conference.

Labour, who have a 15 point lead, are expected to win the seat back next month.

In an interview with the Sunday Times, New York-born Mr Mensch, 59, whose rock acts include Def Leppard and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, said the couple had considered settling in England but his wife was not sure she had a future in the party.

The pair met in 1990 when she was a student at Oxford University and he, at 37, was married and already a leading light in the music industry who she had invited to speak in a debate at the Oxford Union.

Denial: Louise Mensch took to Twitter to respond to her husbands claims in the interview

Setting the record straight: Mrs Mensch said that her family life was the reason she quit as MP for Corby

Mr Mensch said he would stick to music following his wife's response to the interview

She married and had three children with her first husband and forged a career as a best-selling Chick Lit author under her maiden name Louise Bagshawe, but got back in contact with Mensch after she divorced and within several months he had left his wife and they married in 2011.

Mr Mensch said while she ‘really liked the job a lot’, he said she did not see her children often enough and thought being with him in the US - where the father of her children also lives, had a ‘greater lure’ than a career in British politics.

He expressed surprise his wife was constantly on call as an MP, saying ‘I couldn’t manage Louise and that mushrooming situation.’

His own political views, he joked, are ‘to the left of Trotsky’

They have been living as family in New York for just a month.

The MP yesterday retweeted a message from one of her Twitter followers which said ‘he [her husband] might be in for a b******ing’.

But she conceded that her husband ‘doesn’t do on message and I love him for it’ and said she would be ‘thinking of creative ways he can make it up to me.’

The MP, who has set up a social networking site in the States called Menshn, would not, according to her husband, walk into a TV career.

He said: ‘She’s not going to instantly walk on TV like Piers Morgan, who was a big personality when CNN hired him. Louise is just an MP.’
