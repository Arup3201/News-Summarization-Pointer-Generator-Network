Up to one million more Poles are considering moving to the UK to look for work during the next 12 months.

The vast majority are young men aged under 35 who are dissatisfied with wage rates in their homeland, according to a new survey.

There are thought to be at least 500,000 Polish-born people already living in the UK, and the survey suggests that number will continue to rise since relatively few of them are returning home.

Nearly a quarter of those questioned named Britain as the country where they would most like to settle – up from 13 per cent at the beginning of the year. 

Germany is favourite, with 26 per cent naming it, and the Netherlands is in third place on 23 per cent.

Countries with tougher border controls and work restrictions, such as the US, France and Australia, scored much lower, with only around two per cent choosing them.

The survey, carried out by international market research company Millward Brown, indicates that one in every five Poles of working age is considering emigrating by the end of 2015 to improve their standard of living.

Polish parents queue up outside the Polish embassy in London to get passports for their children. There are thought to be at least 500,000 Polish-born people already living in the UK 

Many are well educated and already have jobs in Poland, yet are drawn abroad by opportunity to increase their earnings.

The survey was commissioned by Poland’s biggest recruitment company, Work Service. 

Nearly a quarter of those thinking of emigrating said their main motivation was to live in a country with a better health service and social security system.

But former Polish senator Tomasz Misiak said the overwhelming majority of Poles wanted to work hard rather than claim benefits, adding: ‘They don’t want to go there and get something for nothing.’
