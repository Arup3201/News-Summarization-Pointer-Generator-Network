Private contractors Serco has agreed to repay £68.5million to the taxpayer after over-charging for tagging criminals.

The firm was investigated by the Ministry of Justice over claims that together with rival company G4S it over-charged for tens of thousands of criminals, including those who had left the country, been returned to prison or even died.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling condemned the 'wholly unacceptable' conduct, but also hit out at his own department which 'had been found wanting' in its handling of the contracts.

Fired: Security giants Serco and G4S have been dumped as the contractors responsible for tagging thousands of criminals

Today it emerged Serco has agreed to pay £68.5million for overcharging for electronic tagging contracts which were not properly delivered. The sum also included costs incurred during the investigation.

They had already agreed to return £2million in past profits after it was found staff claimed to have escot prisoners to courts when they had not.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has already been called in to investigate Serco and G4S over electronic tagging.

In addition, G4S has been referred to the
 SFO again after the Ministry of Justice uncovered further problems with
 two contracts for facilities management in the courts.

An audit by big four accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, launched in May, alleged that overcharging began at least as far back as the start of the current contracts in 2005.

Mr Grayling said: 'From the outset I made clear that I intended to take robust action to deal with evidence of unacceptable conduct by suppliers under my department’s contracts, and to recover any monies overpaid as a result of these practices.'

He went on: 'Unlike Serco, G4S has not yet agreed a position on repayment. However, discussions are ongoing and I remain determined to pursue all legal options to recover the taxpayer’s money.

'While it is evident that both suppliers’ conduct under these contracts has been wholly unacceptable, I made clear in my statement in July that my department had been found wanting in its management of the electronic monitoring contracts.'

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has called in rival firm Capita to run carry out the work on an interim basis

The UK-based security firm traces its roots back to a guarding company founded in Denmark in 1901.

G4S was formed when Group 4 merged with Securicor in 2004. The company has a long record of blunders including:

In 1993 Group 4 became the first private company to run prisoner escort services,m and lost seven inmates in three weeks

A year later a hunger striker escaped from Campsfield House detention centre, guarded by Group 4

In 1997 it emerged the firm had transferred a prisoner between two vans on a petrol station forecourt

Three prisoners escaped from Peterborough Crown Court in 2001

In
 2011, G4S staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over 
Birmingham Prison Workers put an electronic tag on criminal Christopher 
Lowcock's artificial limb

In 2012 the firm failed to train enough guards for the London Games which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave

In March this year a G4S guard at Heathrow ordered Royal Navy engineer Nicky Howse to change out
 of her uniform before flying to the US because it was 'offensive'

Francis Maude, minister for the Cabinet Office, which led the broader review of Serco and G4S contracts, said: 'It's good news for taxpayers that Serco has agreed to recompense £68.5 million for overcharging.

'We are confident that the company is taking steps to address the issues which our review has identified.

'Since day one this Government has been working to reform contract management and improve commercial expertise in Whitehall.'

Bill Crothers, chief procurement officer for the Government, who led the review, said: 'Opening up public services to a diverse range of suppliers means that we can access the innovation that the public sector, private companies and the voluntary sectors can bring.

'We need the very best commercial skills to be able to make the most of these opportunities and we know that these skills are not yet strong enough across Government.'

The
 government launched a review of all contracts with G4S and Serco signed
 by every government department after doubts were raised about the use 
of taxpayers’ money.

The scandal could date back as far as 1999, when tagging of criminals began in England and Wales.

Since then the taxpayer has spent £1billion on tagging and monitoring offenders. The current contracts began in 2005.

In
 some cases private contractors charged the Government for years after 
tagging had stopped and cases included being charged for tags for dead 
people.

G4S has 
apologised and offered to repay £24.1 million.

A spokesman said it accepted it ‘wrongly 
considered itself to be contractually entitled to bill for monitoring 
services when equipment had not been fitted or after it had been 
removed’.

The company insisted an 
independent review it commissioned ‘has not identified any evidence of 
dishonesty or criminal conduct by any employee’.

But the Ministry of Justice made clear that the government would not accept the voluntary offer.

A National Audit Office report into 
the electronic monitoring contracts found evidence the 
firms were charging for multiple tags on individual criminals.

In one case Serco charged more than £15,000 for monitoring an offender whose home was not even fitted with the equipment.
