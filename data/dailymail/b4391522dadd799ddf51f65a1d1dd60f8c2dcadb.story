Quitting the European Union would leave Britain could no longer call itself ‘Great’, the French foreign minister.

Laurent Fabius claimed any move to by the UK to sever ties with Brussels would leave the country diminished on the world stage as ‘Small Britain’.

The extraordinary intervention came as Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage prepared to go head to head in their second live TV debate on Britain’s membership of the EU.

David Cameron has promised to claw back powers from Brussels before staging an in-out referendum by the end of 2o17.

The Tory pledge was designed to head off the threat posed by Mr Farage’s Ukip, which wants Britain to leave the EU altogether.

Mr Cameron has sought to build alliances with Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands.

But socialist France has insisted reform is not a priority.

Mr Fabius, the French Foreign Minister in Francois Hollande’s government , claimed Britain would be diminished if it was outside the EU.

He was speaking at a conference in Berlin with his colleagues from German and Poland.

Asked if he thought Britain would still be a full member of the EU in five years' time, he replied: ‘If it is not, it will not be Great Britain but Small Britain.’

UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall: 'It is not EU membership that makes Britain a great country. Indeed, our prospects have been harmed by the EU's political union which has made us less prosperous and less democratic.

'Outside of the EU we could be a Great Britain with a global outlook, able to negotiate our own trade deals.'

The remarks are likely to fuel tensions between London and Paris.

When Mr Hollande visisted Britain in January, he insisted giving the British people a say on leaving the European Union was 'not urgent' and would do little to assist Mr Cameron's push for reform.

Speaking at a press conference alongside Mr Cameron, the French President said: 'France would like the UK to remain within in the EU. France would like to have a more effective European which can attain the objectives which we consider to be essential: growth, employment, energy and of course the capacity to bring in techniques for tomorrow and protect our population.'

But he rejected the Mr Cameron's plea for urgent action to renegotiate the power Brussels currently wields: 'France would like the Eurozone to be better co-ordinated, better integrated. And if there are going to be amendments of the text we don’t think for the time being that they are urgent.

'We feel that revising the Treaty is not a priority for the time being.'

Tomorrow night Ukip leader Mr Farage and Lib Dem Mr Clegg will take part in the second live TV debate on Britain’s EU membership.

Ahead of the clash at 7pm on BBC2, a MailOnline poll revealed 38 per cent of people think Mr Farage is a ‘danger to Britain’ while just 18 per cent said Mr Clegg 'tells the truth’.

Tom Mludzinski, head of political 
polling at ComRes, said: 'While there is little good news for either 
leader here, Nick Clegg should be the more worried.

'After
 nearly four years as Deputy Prime Minister he has failed to convince 
the British public he is more Prime Ministerial than a leader of a Party
 with no MPs. However there is also a warning for Nigel Farage that many
 see him as a danger to Britain.'

'One of the most striking difference 
came when voters were asked which of the two leaders they most 
considered to be ’a bit sleazy’.
