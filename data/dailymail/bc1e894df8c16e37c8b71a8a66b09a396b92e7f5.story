A pit bull in Los Angeles was recovering Monday after being viciously slashed with a knife nearly ear-to-ear by a man who simply despised his breed.

Spartacus didn't even put up a fight as his attacker, who authorities believe may have been his family's neighbor, stabbed his head and body before bashing him with a shovel.

After being stabilized early Saturday, the 2-year-old canine went through two grueling hours of surgery and required some 1,000 stitches.

'It almost looks like they tried to cut his head off, it's ear-to-ear,' Pet Care Veterinary Center Office Manager Alex Kyrklund said. 'He seriously almost looks like an autopsy victim'

'It almost looks like they tried to cut his head off, it's ear-to-ear,' Pet Care Veterinary Center Office Manager Alex Kyrklund told KTLA. 'He seriously almost looks like an autopsy victim.'

Kyrklund, who described Spartacus as 'the sweetest dog in the world' said the pooch miraculously walked away from the ordeal with no broken bones or internal injuries.

'He came up bleeding and torn up, but he never did anything but wag his tail once he realized he was safe,' she said.

Spartacus is now in the loving hands of a foster parent who will keep him while his forever family waits for LAPD Animal Cruelty Task Force officials to find the sick culprit.

'Spartacus did nothing wrong, except to be born as a breed hated by some. His family has loved him a long time,' said the group helping get 'Sparky' back back on his feet. 'We are all thinking of Spartacus with big tears and heavy hearts'

'Spartacus did nothing wrong, except to be born as a breed hated by some. His family has loved him a long time,' wrote Ghetto Rescue FFoundation, the group who've helped Spartacus' low-income family with veterinary costs, on Facebook. 'We are all thinking of Spartacus with big tears and heavy hearts.'

In the mean time, Spartacus needs a lot of time to heal.

'He wants you to love him, he wants you to pet him, but there are so few spots you can do that,' Kyrklund told KTLA.
