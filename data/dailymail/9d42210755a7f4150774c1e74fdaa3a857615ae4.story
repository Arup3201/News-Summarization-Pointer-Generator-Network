An RAF veteran who became a personal trainer to the stars has been spared jail after he admitted to possessing a shotgun without a certificate.

Cain Leathem, 47, claimed on his website to have worked with a string of celebrities, including former Aston Villa striker Stan Collymore, DJ Kate Lawler and ex-Olympic relay champion Mark Lewis-Francis.

Police found the double-barrelled weapon at Leathem’s Birmingham home when his wife called officers following a public argument last month.

Leathem admitted possessing a shotgun without a certificate but avoided jail after the judge, Recorder Patrick Upward QC, read references from some of his star clients.

Mr Upward did not name those who vouched for Leathem but said they included Olympic medallists and Commonwealth Games athletes.

Imposing an eight-month suspended sentence, the judge told him: 'Possessing an unlicensed firearm is very serious and can have consequences far beyond the contemplation of the person in whose house the weapon is found.

'I bear in mind your excellent service record and the support you have had from members of the public.'

Leathem, of Druids Heath, Birmingham, is the founder of GB Fitness and spent five years as an RAF aircraft weapons technician.

His firm was described on its website as an 'exercise and nutritional consultancy'.

On the site, Leathem claimed his other clients had included ex-Walsall and England striker Michael Ricketts, former Wolves player Carl Cort and Diane Youdale - Jet from TV’s Gladiators.

Birmingham Crown Court heard Leathem left the RAF five years ago.

Rebecca Wade, prosecuting, said the defendant 'slapped his wife in the face in public in the course of a disagreement between the two of them'.

Police became involved after the couple had a row at the Isle of Wight music festival on June 14.

Leathem denied having access to guns but officers who searched his home the following day found the weapon, wrapped in white cloth, in the rafters of the garage.

Searched: The house where Cain Leahtem stored his shotgun. He received an eight-month suspended sentence and was ordered to perform 100 hours unpaid work and pay £420 in costs

It was unloaded and appeared to be in good condition, the court heard.

Mr Upward said it was an 'exceptional' case and he accepted Leathem’s claim that the gun had been unused in his garage for ten years.

The defendant was also ordered to perform 100 hours unpaid work and pay £420.

Rex Tedd QC, defending, said Leathem served in the RAF in a specialist role, was of previous good character and had helped those who had suffered serious injury during recent conflicts.

'He has an excellent service record, has a very good business as a personal trainer and is very highly thought of,' Mr Tedd said.

'He is also someone who has helped those who have suffered grievously during the time of recent conflicts.

'Relations between him and his wife appear to have been patched up, although they are not together.'

Writing on a fundraising website last year, Leathem described himself as a keen motorbike rider.

He helped raise almost £2,000 for the Bike Tours for the Wounded initiative, which sends injured servicemen on US motorcycle tours as pillion passengers.

A profile of Leathem on another website said he was born in the Gorbals area of Glasgow but grew up in Birmingham and dropped out of his A-level studies to join the RAF.
