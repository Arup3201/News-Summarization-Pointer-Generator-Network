One of the world’s biggest banks was accused of breathtaking arrogance yesterday for handing a £367m pay bonanza to its London staff.

The staggering sum is being shared out among 121 Goldman Sachs bosses and traders – at an average of £3million a head.

Campaigners said the payouts were obscene and accused the Wall Street bank of ‘sneaking the details out while no one is watching’.

The salary packages equate to nearly £60,000 a week – more than 120 times the average wage.

Deborah Hargreaves of the High Pay Centre said: ‘This is a classic case of trying to bury bad news. 

'This behaviour just underlines the breathtaking arrogance of the banking industry which thinks it can get away with anything.’

John Mann, a Labour MP on the Treasury committee in the Commons, said: ‘Goldman Sachs will struggle to find a biblical justification for this greed. They obviously wanted to sneak this out when everyone was celebrating New Year’s Eve, hoping no one would notice. This just reinforces the message that the bankers that caused us so many problems are out of control and out of touch.’

The Goldman Sachs pay and bonuses, which are for 2013, were handed out just in time to beat a cap introduced by the European Union 12 months ago.

And they comfortably eclipsed the £1.3million average among 13 London banks in the same year, according to research by Reuters news.

Star performers at Barclays in London averaged £1.6million while their counterparts at state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland were on £600,000.

None of the top employees at Goldman were individually identified in the documents filed to the stock market yesterday.

But they would include Michael Sherwood, who is the head of the bank’s UK operation and is thought to be Britain’s highest paid banker.

He scooped around £12.8million in pay and perks for 2013.

The new cap restricts banks to paying a maximum bonus of one year’s salary, rising to twice salary if shareholders approve.

All the major banks have tried to sidestep these restrictions by introducing six- and seven-figure fixed allowances to bolster the basic pay packages of senior staff.

This also means they can pay a bigger bonus, because it is calculated as a multiple of their basic pay – including the new allowances. European Union rules require banks to reveal how many ‘code staff’ – those who take and manage risks – they employ and how much they are paid in cash and shares each year.

But while its rivals published these details months ago, Goldman – which employs around 5,500 people in London – chose to release the details just before the New Year’s Eve deadline.

This week it emerged that RBS boss Ross McEwan plans to accept a £1million fixed allowance in 2015, having forfeited it this year to avoid a row over pay.

Last month, Chancellor George Osborne dropped his attempt to challenge the EU cap on bonuses after it was dismissed by the legal adviser to the European Court of Justice.

The Chancellor said the new rules were ‘badly designed’ and would serve only to inflate bankers’ pay.

He has warned previously that a cap might have a ‘perverse effect’, saying ‘it may undermine responsibility on the banking system rather than promote it’ by increasing the size of salaries.

The Bank of England also warned that the cap could have the ‘undesirable side-effect’ of limiting how much cash regulators can confiscate for wrongdoing.

The Bank’s Governor Mark Carney said rules may need to be introduced that also allow bankers’ fixed pay to be clawed back if they are found guilty of misconduct.

The Canadian said: ‘Standards may need to be developed to put non-bonus or fixed pay at risk.’

Goldman – the most powerful investment bank in the world – has long seen itself as a cut above its rivals and had earned the nickname Goldmine Sacks.

In the wake of the financial crisis, the bank’s American chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, infamously described himself as ‘doing God’s work’ and argued that banks have a vital ‘social purpose’ to create wealth and jobs.

Chris Leslie, Labour Party Treasury spokesman, said: ‘Excessive bonuses aren’t just in stark contrast with the hard times for the vast majority of the rest of society – they have encouraged risky behaviour where the bankers get the rewards and the taxpayer foots the bill if everything goes wrong. 

'This underlines the case for repeating the banker bonus levy that worked well in 2009 but was abandoned by George Osborne.

‘It’s clear that banking reform is unfinished business and the Government shouldn’t allow the banking sector to return to business as usual.’

Frances O’Grady, head of the TUC, said ordinary employees should be given a seat on banks’ remuneration committees to help rein in pay.

She said: ‘Risk-taking banks caused the global crash, yet while pay for the many has fallen every year since 2008 top bankers are still raking it in.

‘It’s time their pay came out of the stratosphere and back to planet Earth.

‘Let us make 2015 the year in which employees get a voice on remuneration committees.’

The UK’s biggest high street lenders will start announcing their bonuses for the past year in the coming weeks. RBS made losses of £8.2billion last year but still paid out £588million in bonuses. It is expected to make its first full year profit since the financial crisis.

Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

The pay packages of Goldman Sachs’ top four executives show how generous the bank is with its most senior staff:

Michael Sherwood

Group vice-chairman, based in London

Pay in 2013: £12.8million

Michael Sherwood – ‘Fat Mike’ to his friends – is a leading Goldman Sachs money-maker and is thought to be Britain’s most highly paid banker.

A career Goldmanite, the 49-year-old joined in 1986 straight from Manchester University, where he studied economics. He is a keen table tennis player and sponsors sporting charities to keep children off the streets.

Lloyd Blankfein

Chief executive and chairman, based in New York

Pay in 2013: £14.7million

Lloyd Blankfein, 60, infamously declared in the heat of the financial crisis in 2009 that he was doing ‘God’s work’. 

But for many he has become the poster child for fat-cat pay and capitalism at its most cut-throat. The son of a truck driver from the Bronx, he was pocketing £45million a year before the crisis in 2007 – a record for any Wall Street boss. 

The Harvard graduate became chief executive in 2006 when his predecessor, Henry Paulson, left to become the Treasury secretary in the Bush administration. On his watch, Goldman has been accused of profiting at its clients’ expense by betting on property prices falling, while selling investments that relied on a rising market.

Gary Cohn

President and chief operating officer

Pay in 2013: £13.5million

The number two at Goldman Sachs started his career selling window frames while in his spare time learning how to trade commodities. He was working in the silver market when Goldman snapped him up in 1990.

Harvey Schwartz

Chief financial officer

Pay in 2013: £13.5million

Tipped to take over from Lloyd Blankfein at the top, Harvey Schwartz has had a stellar career as a trader. Yet the 49-year-old has kept a relatively low profile.
