One of Britain's most famous ships, the Cutty Sark, was damaged by a mystery fire for the second time in recent years.

However, the historic vessel was saved from destruction by the rapid response of firefighters who had developed emergency contingency plans following a devastating blaze seven years ago.

One of Britain's most famous ships, the Cutty Sark, was damaged by a mystery fire for the second time in recent years

Fire crews raced to the 19th Century clipper in Greenwich, south east London, yesterday morning after a blaze broke out below the deck.

Flames damaged an area of the ship's hull, although a 'swift and pre-planned' response to the blaze meant firefighters were able to protect the national treasure.

The ship, launched in 1869, suffered millions of pounds worth of damage when a huge blaze ripped through its wooden hull during a £25 million restoration project in 2007.

Speaking at the scene last night, London Fire Brigade Station Commander George Vost said: 'The Brigade were called just before 7.30am by an automatic fire alarm system.

'Crews from Greenwich fire station responded quickly arriving on the scene within four minutes, at which point to officer in command called for assistance.

The historic vessel was saved from destruction by the rapid response of firefighters

'Within an hour a team of 20 firefighters had extinguished the blaze which damaged hull timbers.'

He added: 'The crews worked swiftly to contain a fire which had broken out on level three, a floor below the top deck, which had started in one of the museum sections.

'Unfortunately a small area of the interior lining of the hull was damaged. We worked with the Cutty Sark conservation team to get the ship open to the public again at 10.30am, around half an hour after its scheduled opening time.

'We have our investigation team on site working with engineers from the ship. Having had a serious incident in the past there was a lot of pre-planning that goes into how we deal with situations like this.

'The Cutty Sark is an important part of the Greenwich Museum and they are very good with carrying out fire drills and fire safety checks.'

Visitors were allowed into the ship while fire investigators inspected the ship's hull to establish the source of the blaze. Teams could be seen abseiling down the port side of the ship looking for clues from the outside as to why the latest incident occurred.

Emergency services were called out to the fire in Greenwich at around 7.30am

Fire originally broke out on the Cutty Sark on May 21st, 2007, causing £10 million worth of damage. Luckily large sections of the ship, including the masts, saloon and deckhouses had been removed prior to the first blaze.

By the time restoration was complete more than 90 per cent of the ship's original features were still intact and the attraction reopened to the public in April 2012.

The cause of the first devastating blaze was blamed on an industrial vacuum cleaner which had been left on for days.

Queuing to look around the boat this morning Egyptian tourist Mahmoud Zayed, 35, said: 'It's a good job this thing didn't go up in flames again.

'It's so beautiful and had so much history attached to it.'

National Maritime Museum spokeswoman Sheryl Twigg said: 'At 7.21am this morning local fire crews responded rapidly to a fire alert on board Cutty Sark.

'This turned out to be a fire and the damage is very limited. The ship opened to the public half an hour later than normal. The cause of the fire is under investigation.'
