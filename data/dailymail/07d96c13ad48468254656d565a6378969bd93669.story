A family were left horrified after finding a four-inch blade in a loaf of bread from a Morrisons in-store bakery.

Andy Newman, 37, from Motspur Park, south west London, bought the sliced loaf for a Mother's Day lunch last Sunday.

His wife Pippa reached into the bag to give three-year-old Madison a slice but luckily spotted the large serrated blade before any harm was done.

Lethal: The razor-sharp four-inch blade was found sticking out the loaf of Morrisons bread

Mr Newman said: 'My wife took out the first slice and put her hand in and as the next slice fell we found the blade sticking out.'

The loaf of bread was sliced in-store by a multi-bladed machine and it is believed part of one of the blades broke off inside the bread.

Mr Newman promptly returned to Morrisons, in Wimbledon Broadway, Wimbledon, south west London, to complain but said he was shocked when the manager first simply offered to refund his £1.30.

He said: 'The store manager eventually begrudgingly offered me £30 vouchers but she didn't really want to do that.

'She was prepared to take the bread off me and give me £1.30 back. I said I think it's was a bit more serious than that.

'It was half-hearted and not genuine. I would have been on my knees saying oh my god I can't believe that was in your bread.'

Narrow escape: Andy Newman and his wife Pippa were about to give their three-year-old daughter Madison a slice of bread when they discovered the blade

Apology: The blade is believed to be from an automated machine but Morrisons has launched an investigation

The manager on duty said she had apologised profusely to Mr Newman and escalated the complaint to their customer services department.

A Morrisons spokesperson said: 'We take the quality and safety of all of the food we make very seriously, so we were very concerned to hear about Mr Newman's experience.

'We immediately checked the remaining bread loaves and are confident that this was a one-off occurrence.

'We have apologised to Mr Newman and offered a gesture of goodwill. Morrisons technical team are now investigating the cause of the incident.'
