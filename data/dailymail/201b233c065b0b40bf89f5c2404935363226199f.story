Success: Fay Hand today secured a five-figure payout for unfair dismissal after winning her employment tribunal case against EE

An employment tribunal has lifted the lid on a 'prank' culture in an EE call centre that resulted in a man being kicked unconscious at his desk.

Workers at the mobile giant's site in Darlington engaged in 'occasional incidents of banter' to lighten up the 'somewhat mundane and repetitive' work, the hearing in Teesside heard.

These included 'crop dusting' - breaking wind near a colleague - as well as switching the language on others' computers, swapping screens to cause confusion and taping up a computer mouse.

But last September, things turned more serious when an employee who had his car keys stolen and his ID card defaced flipped and kicked his colleague at his desk, knocking him unconscious.

Operations manager Fay Hand, 37, who had worked for the firm for almost 17 years, was sacked alongside seven others following the incident.

But today, Mrs Hand secured a five-figure payout for unfair dismissal after winning her employment tribunal case against EE.

Judge Gerald Johnson found the mother of two, who was in charge of 11 team leaders and 111 agents, had an unblemished record and was 'clearly a highly-regarded and valued employee'.

The tribunal heard the disgruntled employee had spoken to Mrs Hand after his cars keys were stolen and a new Fifa computer game inside his vehicle was taken and held for ransom.

Mrs Hand then told the team leader the worker was not happy and asked her to 'sort it out'.

The employee later admitted he had had a 'sense of humour failure' and the issue was believed to be resolved, Teesside Magistrates' Court heard. 

But the following month, when his 
security pass was defaced with a permanent marker by a colleague, he 
kicked the man at his desk until he fell unconscious.

The attacker was immediately suspended and the next day he came to work with a three-page statement, claiming the security pass incident was the 'last straw' and his team leader and Mrs Hand had not taken his complaints seriously.

Following the incident, EE sacked seven employees, including the victim, the kicker, the team leader and Mrs Hand.

The firm said Mrs Hand failed to protect the employee and breached its policy on harassment and bullying.

But Judge Johnson found that the investigation into Mrs Hand’s actions had been 'wholly inadequate', and that her dismissal was pre-judged.

Speaking after the case, Mrs Hand, from Wynyard, Teesside, said the employment tribunal had been 'worth going through'.

She said: 'It was painful but I had to stand up for myself. It was worth going through all of that, I can hold my head up high again with a clear record. That is what I wanted.

'I did love my job, I did it well and there had not been any issues.'

Mrs Hand no longer has a call centre job and works in an office managing fewer people.

Today, her solicitor John Mitton, of PG Legal in Gateshead, said: 'From the outset of meeting with our client, it was evident that there were a number of failures adopted by EE with their procedures. This should be a time for reflection on EE’s part.'

An EE spokesman said: 'We are one of the largest employers in Darlington.

'We take our responsibilities towards our staff very seriously and have robust policies in place that ensure a zero-tolerance approach to bullying and harassment in the workplace.

'We accept the tribunal’s ruling.'
