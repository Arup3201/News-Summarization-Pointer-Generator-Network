Labour would overhaul school inspections in favour of a ‘light-touch’ system allowing teachers to assess each other, Tristram Hunt said

A Labour government would overhaul school inspections in favour of a ‘light-touch’ system allowing teachers to assess each other, the party’s education spokesman has said.

Tristram Hunt said a new peer review system would free up teachers from an ‘avalanche of bureaucracy’ and increase confidence in the regulation process.

The proposals, which would result in Ofsted taking a less hands-on approach, could be a reality by 2020 if Labour was elected, he said.

Mr Hunt acknowledged that the regulator had been a vehicle for progress, but said it was beginning to ‘choke something far more precious’, and threaten the ‘joy’ of schooling.

Speaking at the annual conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in Liverpool, he said: ‘We can begin the process of “mass devolution” where important powers over professional standards, quality assurance, curriculum development and peer review are handed over to profession-led bodies – and we will.

‘Ofsted needs to move towards a supportive, light-touch, profession-led, centrally moderated, peer review system of inspection.

‘I want this conference to hold me to account for moving towards it over the course of the next Parliament.’

The proposals would see teachers and head teachers helping to assess the performance of other schools.

Ofsted would regulate this process, although the details of how the system would work have not been finalised.  

Mr Hunt said: ‘Let nobody tell you this is a soft touch. Let nobody tell you this is a threat to standards. Rather this is the embodiment of trust, collaboration and a 21st-century approach to rigour and under-performance.’

He added: ‘I want to see an inspectorate that moves beyond box-ticking and data-dependence.

‘I want to see an inspectorate that allows heads with a strong track record the space to innovate and develop a richer criterion of school achievement.’

Priya Dutta, spokesman for the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘The system needs an overhaul, and in general we would welcome proposals for this.

‘But the problem with peer review is that it’s so open to abuse.

‘We would be sceptical about how impartial this peer review would be, so these things would need to be planned very carefully.

‘I’m slightly wary of Ofsted taking a step back because I think there needs to be an independent teaching review body. I wonder how effective peer review would be in practice.’
