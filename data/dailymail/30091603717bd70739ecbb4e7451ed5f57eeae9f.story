Today, smokers have to huddle in the cold outside offices and pubs to indulge their habit. But once it was the height of glamour, and no Hollywood star would be seen without a cigarette on their lips. 

Elio Sorci, the world’s first paparazzo, took more than 14,000 striking and candid pictures of celebrity life in Rome from the Fifties to the late Seventies. 

And in many the stars are shrouded in smoke. These pictures of an age before the risks of cancer were understood are collected in a new book, Paparazzo: The Elio Sorci Collection.
