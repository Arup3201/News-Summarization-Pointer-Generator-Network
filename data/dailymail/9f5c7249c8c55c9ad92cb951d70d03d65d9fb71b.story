WSOCTV reports that the 62-year-old who died was Poole's father. 

Poole said she did not realize her father had died because her children often took food into his room. 

She claimed police were called as soon as they found him.

Discussing the filth in the home she insisted it had became dirty because her children had been ill.

'My kids had been sick with the flu, rotavirus,' she said. 

'It's been happening for a month. There were things that haven't been taken care of. I feel like I'm getting accused of being a bad mom for worrying about my kids rather than my house.'  

Campbell said the children, ranging in age from 9 months to 13 years, have been placed in the temporary custody of the Department of Social Services.

One of the children did not belong to either suspect. 

Both Poole and Dishner have been released on bond. 

Dishner also was charged on an old driving with a revoked driver's license. 

It was not clear if Dishner and Poole have lawyers. 

Deputies told NBC Charlotte the man had been dead at least 24 hours.
