Just days after serving as best man at his parents' wedding, a terminally ill 2-year-old boy has died from leukemia and other complications.

Logan Stevenson died in his mother's arms at 8:18 p.m. on Monday at their home in Jeannette, about 25 miles east of Pittsburgh. 

'He is with angels and he's in no more pain,' wrote mom Christine Swidorsky in a tribute to her brave son on Facebook.

Logan Stevenson, two, passed away on Monday night just two days after he had served as best man at his parents' wedding in Jeannette, Pa

Logan's parents had brought forward their wedding because they had wanted him to see them marry and to be part of family photos

Logan had looked dapper in a tiny tan pinstripe suit and orange shirt for Saturday's 12-minute ceremony, as his mom carried him down the isle on her shoulder.

The young boy then stood with his grandmother, Debbie Stevenson, during the ceremony uniting Logan's mom and his father, Sean Stevenson.

The couple had decided to abandon an original wedding date of July 2014 after learning from doctors late last month that their son didn't have long left.

They wanted Logan to see them marry and for him to be part of family photos.

Logan, who was born Oct. 22, 2010, was diagnosed shortly after his first birthday with acute myeloid leukemia. He suffered from Fanconi anemia, a rare disease that often leads to cancer.

He endured a stem cell transplant in July 2012 and then in March had undergone surgery to remove a kidney ravaged by a tumor.

During a Make-A-Wish trip to Disney World in June, Logan had fallen ill. He was hospitalized in Florida before being flown back to Pittsburgh.

During a trip to the emergency room last month, a test revealed a mass in his remaining kidney, which led to his terminal prognosis.

Swidorsky's daughter, Isabella Johns, 
13, served as bridesmaid and the couple's one-year-old daughter, 
Savannah, was her parents' flower girl.

Logan spent his remaining days at home, where he was showered with attention from family members.

'It hurts so bad because Logan is such a loving child... when I cry he wipes my tears away,' Swidorsky told The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review prior to her wedding. 'Logan is a mama's boy.'

'His entire life has been nothing but hospitals,' Kellie Young, the toddler's aunt told the newspaper.

Last week doctors gave the little boy at best two to three weeks to live and told his devastated parents that 
continuing treatment would not be beneficial.

Tears: Father Sean Stevenson had said he felt helpless trying to deal with his son's prognosis

They told Swidorsky and Stevenson the best thing for Logan was to be at home with his parents, that he would be in less pain there.

'For such a small person, he has touched thousands of people,' Young said.

Logan's father said he felt happy he had the chance to bring his son home from hospital and spend time with him. But at the same time he said he felt helpless.

'It'll be the hardest thing I'll ever do is bury my son. You know it's coming, and you can't do anything about it,' he said.
