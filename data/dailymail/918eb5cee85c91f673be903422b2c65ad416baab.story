When allegations of drug possession were levelled at Sara Huegill on Saturday April 26, the news sent whispers rippling through the Sydney public relations industry.

The stylish publicist, who now runs her own boutique firm Row A PR, was charged alongside husband Geoff with possessing an illicit drug at Royal Randwick.

The pair were allegedly found in a suite at the races with a small quantity of white powder which police claim was cocaine. 

‘Karma’s a b***h,’ said one former workmate, who added that the industry was squirming with rumours about the 30-year-old.

‘I am aware of these rumours, and equally aware of the tactics employed by some unscrupulous industry participants to undermine potential competitors,’ Ms Huegill told MailOnline via email.  

When the news broke, many of her ex-colleagues were quick to delve into Ms Huegill’s work history and her career as a publicist was the subject of gossip for days. Much of it was untrue. 

But MailOnline can now reveal Ms Huegill was sacked from her job at Sweaty Betty PR for sending sporting compression wear and supplements to an 'unknown identity' in Rose Bay in 2010 without authorisation from her bosses or the firm’s client.

Evidence suggests Ms Huegill was terminated from her PR job at Sweaty Betty for 'dishonest conduct' relating to the handling of stock belonging to Nathan Picklum, owner of fitness wear and supplement business Body Science. 

According to a letter dated ‘22nd July 2010’, Ms Huegill (Ms Hills at the time) was sacked with immediate effect after '$850 worth of Body Science product (was) dispatched without consent to an unknown identity.'

According to documents, the intended recipient was a 'Matt Aboud' of Rose Bay. It is understood it was the same Matt Abood who lives in Rose Bay and is a member of the Australian national swimming team.

The Aboods are close friends with the Huegills and invited them to their wedding in December 2013. Mr Abood's wife Hayley has also 'liked' Sweaty Betty PR on her Facebook account. 

It is not suggested Matt Abood, a relay world champion, ever consumed unauthorised supplements or that the Aboods knew that anything was sent to them without authorisation. 

A staffer at the courier company tasked with delivering the stock to Rose Bay confirmed it was dispatched but said 'the stock was returned to Sweaty Betty PR' in Alexandria on 21 July 2010 when the listed recipient told the courier he had the ‘wrong phone number’. 

According to the Body Science website, Australian swimmers James Magnussen and Eamon Sullivan are both clients. Body Science also supplies to eight NRL clubs and five AFL clubs.

Last year Body Science owner Nathan Picklum, in an interview about drugs in sport, told The Sydney Morning Herald: ‘We're very stringent. We have to be, we can't afford even a one in a million chance we might compromise an athlete.

Our products are tested at Bond University (in Queensland) and in the UK because they have the most stringent testing procedures over there.’

Asked about her relationship with Abood, Ms Huegill said: ‘Matt Abood is a friend but also part of my broader professional network as a sportsperson with profile in a position to potentially endorse client product.’

A letter to Sara Huegill from her then boss Roxy Jacenko has been obtained in which the publicity queen and Celebrity Apprentice star said: ‘I am most upset and distressed by what has occurred within the business today – 

‘The bag of Body Science product was in fact sent yesterday July 20 2010 And returned to me personally at 8am this morning.

‘Not only was it sent with NO approval, it was sent on an express courier. 

‘(The) email for approval to giveaway product was sent to our client after the product had been sent to Matt Aboud at the Rose Bay address as per the label. 

‘This was also after you denied any knowledge of sending any Body Science product out of the Sweaty Betty PR offices and replied “no no I haven’t sent anything to that person".'

PR queen: Jacenko fired Ms Huegill with immediate effect in July 2010, documents reveal

A source said there is rampant speculation that Ms Huegill inspired Jacenko’s fictional ‘sticky-fingered publicist’ character in her first novel as a result of the incident. 

Ms Huegill has since removed Sweaty Betty PR from her list of employers on LinkedIn. 

In response to MailOnline’s direct question about the Body Science incident, Ms Huegill wrote the following: ‘It was well known at the time that Ms Jacenko was actively looking to terminate my employment for reasons mostly unrelated to performance.

‘In the end, the basis of my termination from Sweaty Betty PR, was that I had not sought express authorisation from Ms Jacenko to distribute samples of client product to a third-party despite the distribution of client product to potential third-party endorsers being something the industry survives on and something Sweaty Betty PR did every single day.’

After Sweaty Betty, she worked at Trend Imports and Glue Store, where Kathryn Diprose told MailOnline: ‘Sara Huegill ceased working with any of our brands over 12 months ago, we won't be commenting on anything.’

She also previously worked at Impact Communications. An Impact spokeswoman said Ms Huegill ‘decided that she wanted to pursue the dream of working in fashion PR’ and left voluntarily. 

Ms Huegill said: ‘Having seen the success Geoff has achieved in all levels of life through hard work and running his own brand, it made sense to me that if I wanted to achieve that level of success I had to be in control of my own profession, hence it makes sense to be my own boss.’

Asked about Saturday’s drug possession charge, Ms Huegill said: ‘I don’t have anything to add to the comments Geoff made yesterday, sorry.’

Roxy Jacenko, also via email, said the following: ‘Sara Hills was dismissed for disloyal conduct – one can play it or manipulate it any way they want but that’s the start and finish of why she was terminated from her employment at Sweaty Betty PR. 

‘It was I must say a shame as we did enjoy her company and she was a good publicist.’
