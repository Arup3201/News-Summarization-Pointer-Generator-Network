A dog lost on a 2,300ft hill for three weeks after chasing a rabbit and breaking its leg was saved by eight rescuers who carried him a mile to safety on a stretcher.

The lurcher-Saluki cross was found half-starved near a World War Two memorial at the top of Buckden Pike fell in the Yorkshire Dales.

It is thought the four-year-old dog had chased a rabbit up the hill, got lost and then been stuck on the fell for nearly a month with his injured limb.

Pet rescue: The dog lost on a fell top in the Yorkshire Dales with a broken leg was saved by a team of wight mountain rescuers who carried the lurcher-Saluku cross, nicknamed Wulfra, to safety on their stretcher

Found: A walker spotted the dog lying injured on a 2,300ft-tall fell, close to a memorial cross that commemorates the crash of a Wellington bomber during the Second World War

Saved: Volunteers from the Upper Wharfedale Fell Rescue Association were called out to go to the animal's aid

The animal, nicknamed Wufra, was finally saved by members of the Upper Wharfedale Fell Rescue Association (UWFRA) who were called out to go to the animal’s aid.

Team Leader Andy Jackson, 44, said eight members went up and carefully carried Wufra a mile down hill to safety.

'He was so camouflaged he was probably hard to see,' said Mr Jackson.

'Fortunately, he was on the side that was protected from the worst of the weather.

On a mission: The volunteers put Wufra into a casualty bag and onto the stretcher to carry him the mile down the side of the fell

Relief: Rescue worker Andy Jackson said that Wufra had been happy to see the team, and seemed to enjoy his trip on the stretcher

'When we eventually moved him, we put him into a casualty bag and on to the stretcher, the actual grass had started to die where he had been sitting.

'He was happy to see us. He just had nothing in him. There was a lot of bone. 

'He was obviously a thin dog anyway, but it looked like he hadn’t eaten.

'I don’t think he would have been able to stand up. He was quite happy to be picked up, kept warm and seemed to quite enjoy his trip down in the stretcher.

Safe at last: The team then carried Wufra to their vehicles parked on a track near the village of Starbotton in Wharfedale, North Yorkshire

Shaggy dog story: Mr Jackson said he believed the dog may have previously been used for rabbiting as he had scars on his face

'He made no attempt to get off the stretcher. He just seemed quite happy.'

The team then carried the dog, whose owner is unknown, to their vehicles which had been left parked up on a track near the village of Starbotton in Wharfedale, North Yorkshire.

Mr Jackson said he believed the dog may have previously been used for rabbiting as he had scars on his face.

Rescue workers have estimated that Wufra had been stranded on the fell for around three to four weeks based on how underweight he was.

Rescue route: Volunteers carried stricken Wufra from Buckden Pike to the village of Starbottom

Recovery: Skinny Wufra, described as having 'nothing in him' when he was found, is now recovering from his ordeal at training centre The Dog People in Grassington

After the rescue mission, Wufra was taken to nearby Grassington where he was picked up by Helen Coates from training centre The Dog People.

She said: 'At the moment we are just taking care of him, making sure he gets rest and food. He’s eating now, and drinking and starting to walk around a bit.

'We’ll look after him here until he’s better. Hopefully his rightful owner will turn up to collect him. But if not, he might become part of the family.'

Wufra was also cared for by vet Tony Turnbull at Kingsway Veterinary hospital in Skipton, North Yorkshire and is now well on his way to recovery.
