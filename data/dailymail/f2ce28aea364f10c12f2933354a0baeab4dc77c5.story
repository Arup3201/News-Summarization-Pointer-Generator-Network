A successful businessman with a 'Jekyll and Hyde character' has been jailed after systematically abusing two girlfriends he met through Facebook.

Keith Turner, 43, from York, physically and mentally abused the two women in a series of humiliating and frightening incidents which included him spitting in their faces, throwing one victim’s shredded clothes in the road and posting a fictional profile on an adult website so that men turned up at one victim’s home, expecting sexual favours.

He even undid the seatbelt of one of his victims - both in their forties - while driving his Lamborghini and slammed on the brakes.

The women finally took out harassment orders against Turner and only realised he had targeted them both when they met through a counselling website for the victims of domestic violence.

The court heard how Turner had smashed one victim’s laptop and destroyed both of their phones.

On other occasions, he drove in a frightening manner, terrifying his victim, and scratched the other’s car with his keys.

He later apologised at the home of one of his victims, where he was viewing white supremacist websites.

Turner purchased an ex-USSR gas mask on eBay, joined neo-Nazi website Combat 18 and showed one of the women pictures of swastika tattoos.

Hull Crown Court heard Turner, the owner of VW Relics Ltd in East Yorkshire, became controlling and obsessively jealous about the victims’ former partners soon after starting to see the women, whom he met online through a shared interest in cars.

The court heard Turner would impress them with his motor 
business, Lamborghini and boat moored at York. He would take them to the
river or outings to pubs and car shows at Donnington Park.

But both women described his sudden 
mood changes when they were near other men or when they would not reveal
their previous sexual encounters.

Turner met both women through the social networking site

Turner was jailed for 16 months after pleading guilty to two counts of causing a person to fear violence by harassment.

The court was told the first victim - a 44-year-old woman - was in a relationship with Turner for about ten months between November 2010 and August 2011.

Judge Jeremy Baker QC said: 'As that 
relationship developed, it’s apparent that you had a somewhat Jekyll and
Hyde character because soon thereafter, you subjected her to 
distressing, damaging, socially isolating, humiliating and frankly 
violent acts.'

He began seeing a 46-year-old woman for two months from September 2011.

Incidents inflicted on his first victim included:

Incidents inflicted on his second victim included:

Sentencing Turner, Judge Baker said the perpetrators of domestic violence often had 'two personae' - one seen by the outside world and another darker side only seen by their partners.

He said: 'That’s clearly the situation in this case. You repeatedly apologised for your actions and went on to repeat the same or worse offending to these victims.'

He noted that Turner had seven previous convictions including common assault, actual bodily harm, and battery.

Steven Crossley, for Turner, said his client had asked him to apologise to the court and his victims for his behaviour.

Judge Baker said: 'These matters involve some degree of physical violence. The victims have altered their lifestyles to avoid contact with yourself. They have been left feeling anxious.

'In my opinion, the case is so serious that it’s right that you are punished for this case by way of a term of immediate imprisonment.'
