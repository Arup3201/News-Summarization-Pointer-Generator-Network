Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was today indicted on 30 counts, including 17 that carry the death penalty, by a federal grand jury for the horrific April 15 attack.

The 19-year-old is charged with killing four people - three who died in the two bomb blasts and an MIT police officer who was shot dead three days later - and 'maiming, burning and wounding scores of others', U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.

Other charges include using a weapon of mass destruction, carjacking, engaging in a fierce shootout with police and causing serious injuries to a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer.

The indictment also revealed a chilling confession Tsarnaev allegedly wrote inside a boat where he was found hiding four days after the bombings, reading: 'I don't like killing innocent people.'

But in the message, he justified his actions by adding: 'The US Government is killing our innocent civilians. I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one, you hurt us all. Stop killing our innocent people, we will stop.'

Found: Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat parked in a yard in Watertown. Inside, he wrote that he 'didn't like killing innocent people' but explained it was revenge for the U.S. killing Muslims

Three people were killed and more than
 260 injured near the finish line of the marathon on April 15 when 
Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan allegedly detonated two 
home-made devices.

The 56-page
 indictment alleges that the brothers started preparing for the attack 
more than two months before, purchasing weapons, explosives and visiting
 shooting ranges.

The
 court documents suggest the internet played a central role in the 
suspects' radicalization. They allege the brothers referred to websites 
for jihad propaganda and bomb-making instructions.

The
 indictment claimed that Tsarnaev had downloaded material from extremist
 jihad sites including Defense of the Muslim Lands, the First Obligation
 After Imam, by Abdullah Azzam, who is also known as 'the Father of 
Global Jihad'.

'This 
publication advocates violence designed to terrorize the perceived 
enemies of Islam, among other things,' the indictment said.

Authorities
 said the brothers made shrapnel-packed pressure cooker bombs to inflict
 maximum devastation and put them in knapsacks near the finish line.

The bombs went off within seconds of 
one another, killing three people: Restaurant manager Krystle Marie 
Campbell, 29; a Boston University graduate student from China, Lu 
Lingzi, 23; and an eight-year-old boy, Martin William Richard.

Hundreds more were wounded and many had to have limbs amputated.

After images of the Tsarnaev brothers were released two days later by law enforcement, the brothers killed MIT officer Sean Collier and attempted to steal his service weapon, according to the indictment.

At
 the time, they were already armed with five improvised explosive 
devices, a Ruger P95 semi-automatic pistol, ammunition, a machete, and a
 hunting knife, according to the indictment.

They
 also allegedly carjacked a man, identified in the papers as 'D.M.', and
 forced him to take out $800 from an ATM to give them. The man managed 
to escape and call 911.

A shootout in a quiet Watertown neighborhood ensued and Tsarnaev's older brother, Tamerlan, was killed following the gunfire.

The indictment alleges that the younger brother contributed to the death when he drove over Tamerlan while
 escaping police officers during the shootout. It claims a police 
officer was trying to drag Tamerlan to safety when he was hit by the 
car.

The indictment also notes that Tsarnaev 
caused 'serious bodily injury' to Massachusetts Bay Transportation 
Authority officer Richard Donohue in the course of his escape.

Dzhokhar was arrested after he was found hiding in a boat parked in a backyard later that day.

He
 was injured during a shoot out with officers and was taken to hospital 
with a gunshot wound to the throat. He has been held in a Massachusetts 
prison hospital since.

Seeking justice: U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz announces the indictment against Tsarnaev on Thursday

Staying strong: A makeshift memorial was set up for victims of the bombings near the marathon finish line

The
 Tsarnaev brothers had roots in the turbulent Russian regions of 
Dagestan and Chechnya, which have become recruiting grounds for Islamic 
extremists. They had been living in the United States for about a decade
 and it is believed they had been inspired by Al Qaeda publications.

The U.S. attorney's office says 17 of the charges against 19-year-old Tsarnaev could bring life in prison or the death penalty.

'I have met several of those that were injured on April 15, as well as members of the deceased's families,' Ortiz said at the press conference on Thursday. 'Their strength is extraordinary, and we will do everything we can to pursue justice, not only on their behalf but on behalf of all of us.'

He will be arraigned on July 10.
