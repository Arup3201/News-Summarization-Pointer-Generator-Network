The wife of a British captain has blamed the Army for a miscarriage she suffered while her husband was stationed in Kenya.

Katherine Howe, 38, said the stress of being forced to move to Nairobi after two pregnancy scares led to the death of her unborn daughter Harriet at 22 weeks.

Mrs Howe and her husband Captain David Howe insist doctors said she needed to rest at a training camp but the Army said she had to travel the 150 miles back to the capital for a flight home.

A week later she miscarried in hospital, where Harriet's body was but in an orange plastic bag and thrown away before the couple had sufficient time to say goodbye.

They complained about their treatment in November 2011 and the Ministry of Defence is yet to respond two-and-a-half years later, claiming it is still investigating what happened. 

'Ultimately we hold the army responsible for the death of our daughter,' Mrs Howe told The Times, adding: 'I feel totally let down.'

Mrs Howe said she had stayed silent because she feared her husband's career could be harmed. 

But because their complaint remains unresolved she has chosen to explain why they feel failed.

Anger: Mrs Howe says that she should never have been moved from Nanyuki to Nairobi

Captain Howe, from Wiltshire, was sent to Kenya in 2010 and his wife and their two-year-old son also came.

Mrs Howe fell pregnant in March 2011 and she said they asked the army what their policy on pregnancy was in Kenya and if they were going to be moved - but claim they had no clear answer. 

While based at a camp at Nanyuki, close to Mount Kenya, she suffered a bleed at 19 weeks, the second of her pregnancy, and said a consultant told her to rest for a week.

But she said the army told them they would be moved the three hours back to Nairobi within 48 hours for a flight back to the UK, but she lost the baby.

Her husband lodged a formal complaint in November 2011, which is still unresolved.  

An army spokesman said: 'The army has offered its sincere apologies for the delay in dealing with the family's complaint but whilst the case is still under investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further'.
