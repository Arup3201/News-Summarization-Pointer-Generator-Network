Allan Austin, 57, has a hernia the size of a football which makes it hard for him to walk and causes 'awful' pain

A man with a hernia the size of a football says he was accidentally wiped from the surgery waiting list - and has now been told there's no funding to treat him.

Allan Austin, 57, has seen the 30cm by 30cm hernia continue to grow during his eight-month ‘nightmare’ and says he can barely walk.

Mr Austin, from Maidenhead, says he is in ‘awful’ pain - and the delay in his treatment has meant the hernia is now too big for standard hernia surgery to be appropriate.

As a result, he needs a £12,000 more complex operation, but has been told funding is not available as the surgery is ‘not essential’.

Mr Austin said: ‘It’s been a nightmare. They can’t leave me like this, it’s just too painful.

‘It’s awful. In the morning I can sort of walk about but as the day progresses it gets heavier and by the end I can hardly walk.

‘The hernia was painful to start with but I could get about. Now it is five times bigger and really heavy.

‘If I drop something on the floor I can't get down to pick it up and I’m in constant pain.

‘The stabbing pain stops me in my tracks and it’s so sore. After 4.30pm every day I spend the rest of the day sitting down because of it.’

Mr Austin, who works for an engineering firm, was first admitted to Wexham Park Hospital, near Slough, with a burst abscess in his bowel in April 2013.

He credits staff for saving his life during an operation to fit a colostomy bag, but he developed a small hernia as a result.

Surgery to correct it was postponed in November as doctors weren’t happy with the results of an ECG – a test used to detect heart problems.

Then in January, the hospital revealed Mr Austin had accidentally been removed from the waiting list altogether.

By now, the hernia had got worse, ballooning from around three to four inches to the size of a football.

And rather than standard hernia treatment, he needs a four to five hour operation to fit a mesh to hold the hernia back.

He said the doctors appealed to the local clinical commissioning group for a grant to cover the £12,000 cost but were only offered £5,000, leaving a £7,000 shortfall.

Mr Austin has hit out at the administration errors that have caused him to fall through the cracks.

He is particularly concerned as untreated hernias can cause dangerous complications such as a bowel obstruction or interruption to the herniated tissue's blood supply.

In a letter to MP Theresa May, he said: ‘The sheer negligence and incompetence shown to me in the last eight months is quite unbelievable.

‘No one seems to care anymore. Not once have I been asked about this whole situation and how I feel about it.’

The hospital trust has apologised for the delay and launched an investigation.

A statement from the hospital said: ‘Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust would like to apologise to Mr Austin for the delay in his treatment.

‘The trust is conducting a thorough investigation into all aspects of Mr Austin’s care and is in contact with him to ensure he is aware of the outcomes of this investigation.’
