Just a day earlier, the people of this tiny rural town had gathered together to say goodbye to their favourite son.

But on the outskirts of Macksville on Thursday morning, there was little hint of the scale of the tragedy that had rocked them to the core.

The only indication of Phillip Hughes’ death at 25 were the bouquets of fresh flowers tied to the fence posts of a field where his prized Angus cows still graze.

He had only bought the 93-hectare block in January, part of a retirement plan that friends said he valued even more highly than cricket.

The farm near Tilly Willy Creek, which runs off the Nambucca River, was purchased by Hughes in January

A ute sits in the garage with the sticker 'Aussies love Angus', beside a quad bike, a box labelled 'Phil's helmets' and an upturned horseshoe for good luck.

It is a beautiful property, with well-kept vegetable gardens, chooks and a pet bird.

One day the cricketer dreamed of expanding his property by buying the adjacent blocks on either side of the farm.

When he retired from cricket, Hughes planned on coming back to his beloved Macksville and building a new home there.

Phillip Hughes died last Thursday, two days after he was struck in the neck by a cricket ball at Sydney Cricket Ground

Hughes' business partner Corey Ireland said the cricketer had hoped to build a home on the property

With the help of his loved ones, his dream will hopefully be realised.

Following Hughes' tragic death, his uncle - who lives on the Tilly Willy Creek 408 homestead - will continue to look after the property.

But it is not just his homestead that has links to Hughes' Test number of 408.

His beloved stud of Angus bulls are named 408 and are seen sitting quietly under the shade of a large tree to escape the hot summer sun of New South Wales' mid-north coast.

Many others are on Hughes' business partner and close friend Corey Ireland's stud farm in Wagga Wagga. in New South Wales' south-west.

Mr Ireland - who was one of the select few who gave a moving tribute at Hughes' funeral on Wednesday - said the batsman had grand plans for his livestock.

He and the tragic cricketer had marked out a ten-year plan, which will now continue with father Greg Hughes in his son's place.

'Luckily his father Greg loves cattle just as much as he does and will help build his farm and his business... we'll have to make a couple of changes [to the plan]. But we'll keep it going,' Mr Ireland told Daily Mail Australia.

The 25-year-old was also planning to retire on the property after he had finished his cricketing career

And that's where Mr Ireland's focus is now turned after he paid his last respects to the cricketer, along with thousands from across Australia and the world who descended on the 2,600-strong town.

Hughes died two days after he was hit in the neck by a cricket ball at Sydney Cricket Ground during day one of the Sheffield Shield.

'The hurt will always be there but we need to find a way to move forward,' Mr Ireland told Daily Mail Australia.

'Tomorrow is a new day.'

But Ireland promises the 25-year-old will never be far from his and his family's thoughts.

Mr Ireland's two sons, who adored the cricketer, have been hugely influenced by Hughes and show signs of carrying on his legacy and making his dreams a reality.

'My boys have shown their own interest in farming and cows. They loved their time with Phillip,' Mr Ireland said.

The left-hand batsman was loved by all children, including his four young cousins who attended the funeral in their Macksville cricket club shirts, embroidered with 'PH 63 not out' and his baggy green number, 408, on the back.

'All children loved him, he couldn't help himself. Such a big heart,' Mr Ireland said.

Phillip Hughes looked forward to the day he would have his own family, according to Mr Ireland. 

He spoilt Mr Ireland's own children enormously.

Thousands attended Hughes' funeral at Macksville High School on Wednesday

When he delivered Hughes' eulogy, Mr Ireland spoke of how Hughes took the children to the Sydney Show and they returned with 26 showbags.

'They've never had 26 showbags and they never will again,' Mr Ireland said with a laugh.

The funeral was a difficult day, but a perfect farewell for their beloved 'Boof'.

'Phillip would have loved yesterday. It was sad but a wonderful farewell,' Mr Ireland said. 

He said he was grateful for the short but special time he had with Hughes.

'I'm happy I had the time with Phillip to talk and make plans. He was a great person and he did as much good for me as I did for him,' Mr Ireland said.
