Texas Governor Rick Perry toured the U.S.-Mexico border today without President Barack Obama, who ultimately decided to return to Washington, D.C. this afternoon after making a pit stop for BBQ in Austin.

Perry's office says he took a boat ride down the Rio Grande river and a chopper tour of the Rio Grande Valley with the Texas Department of Public Safety this afternoon.

Meanwhile, President Obama spoke at a Democratic Party fundraiser, met with someone who wrote him a letter and gave remarks on the economy before stopping by Franklin Barbeque, where he dropped more than $300 on food for his staff and people he cut in line.

Perry repeatedly invited the president to visit the border with him, including during a face-to-face meeting yesterday, but the White House declined, saying the updates Obama was receiving from administration officials who had been down there were good enough.

'The first thing I asked him when I got on to Air Force One,' Perry told Fox News' Sean Hannity last night after his meeting with Obama, is if he would come to the border.

'I said Mr. President, I said,' "I really want you to come and see this cause this is important for you to absorb as a father, but more importantly as the President of the United States to see the humanitarian crisis and to also understand how you can move the border patrol forward, away from the 45 miles or so back they are today to be right on the border to see what the Department of Public Safety is doing with our gun boats in the river to stop the criminal activity that's going on.'That's what the president needs to see,' Perry continued. 'He needs to understand instinctively and intuitively and with his own two eyes what’s going on on the border.'

Perry said Obama was only 
311 miles from border town McAllen, Texas, which doesn't take 
long to get to in a plane.'Air Force One's a pretty fast ride,' he said.

At a press conference in Austin his meeting with Perry, Obama said he was 'not interested in photo ops.'

'Nothing has taken place down there that I'm not intimately aware of,' the president said. 'This is not theater.'

Perry characterized the president's decision not to join him as a mistake of monumental proportions.

'I think about the criticism that Goerge W. Bush received when he didn't 
go to New Orleans [right after Hurricane] Katrina,' Perry told Hannity, piggybacking off of fellow Texas lawmaker Henry Cuellar's comments earlier this week that Obama's refusal to visit the border could be his 'Katrina moment.'

'This is no different,' Perry said.

'I'm pretty sure that if George Bush had said, well, I sent my FEMA director down multiple times that he would have still been criticized greatly because you need to go.'

Obama made a surprise visit to the Austin, Texas, restaurant before heading to the airport to fly back to Washington, D.C.

After several weeks of public back and forth about the Obama administration's handling of the situation along the portion of the border that the U.S. shares with Texas, Perry and the president put aside their differences yesterday and met to discuss the Texas governor's concerns.

Both Perry and the president said the meeting went well, and Perry told Hannity the president seemed to 'philosophically' agree with him on the need to secure the border.

'I may have been a bit of a thorn in his side over the years,' he said, 'but I've tried to do it in a respectful way and a thoughtful way. And what I think is right for the people of Texas, and in this case, what's right for America.'

In a letter to the president today, Perry said he hoped their meeting was 'the beginning of a productive diaologue' and reiterated what actions he'd like to see the federal government take moving forward.

Those include: the deployment of 1,000 National Groups to the border, medical screenings for all illegal immigrants who come to the U.S. and changes to a federal law that disallows unaccompanied children from countries other than Mexico or Canada who cross the border illegally to be sent home immediately.

'Additionally, Mr. President, I cannot stress enough how important it is for you to visit the borderto witness the damage that the failure to secure the border is doing to our country and to demonstrate for all Americans, as well as the governments of Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, your commitment to ending this humanitarian crisis,' Perry wrote.

'Your visit would also provide an ideal opportunity to meet with the Texas Congressional Delegation to discuss þermanent solutions to our border security issues.

'Because this issue deserves swift action, I am available to help facilitate this meeting with the delegation.'

Perry's office did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment on additional details about Perry's tour of the border today.
