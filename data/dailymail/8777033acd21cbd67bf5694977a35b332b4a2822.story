Chelsea are stronger now than when Jose Mourinho's team last beat Paris Saint-Germain, Lucas Moura has admitted.

But PSG's Brazilian midfielder insisted that the French champions can still gain revenge on the Premier League giants in the last 16 of the Champions League.

Moura was in the side beaten on away goals in the quarter-final last season and he pinpointed Cesc Fabregas and Didier Drogba as two summer signings who have since made Chelsea a force to be reckoned with.

But PSG have also made significant signings of their own, including David Luiz in a £50million buy from Stamford Bridge, and Moura said his team-mates have nothing to fear.

'It will be a great game against a great team, as are all Champions League matches,' the Brazilian told PSG TV.

'We will work hard to win these matches. I believe in my team.

'You have to respect Chelsea. We are very strong, we can win and we will work for that.

'Compared to last season, Chelsea have changed more than us. They are very strong with Drogba and Fabregas.

'It will be a very interesting match but we can win. Anyway, I'm very motivated and I will give everything to win.'

Both teams have strengthened in the summer, with David Luiz joining PSG and Cesc Fabregas at Chelsea 

PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi was pleased with drawing Chelsea, rather than Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid, Monaco, Bayern Munich, Porto or Dortmund.

'Chelsea is a good draw for us,' he said. 'I am very confident. I trust my coach and my players to display the best of Paris Saint-Germain.

'We learned a lot from the experience of last season, and we will work to have a different ending this year.'

The first leg will be held in Paris in February.
