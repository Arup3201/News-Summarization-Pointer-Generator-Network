Not long ago it was seen as a sign of scruffiness and incivility.

But a shift in male fashion has led to a remarkable resurgence of the beard - and it appears not even royalty can resist the urge to grown one.

Prince Felipe VI of Spain was pictured today with the neatly styled grey and black face fuzz he has sported since the summer, following his clean shaven coronation in June.

The monarch was photographed with wife Queen Letizia at the launch of a new Spanish dictionary at the Real Academia Española, in Madrid.

His bold new look gives him  the crown as Europe's only bearded monarch - harping back to the days of his bearded namesake, Felipe II, who famously sent his Spanish Armada to conquer England in 1588.

The king had intended to dispatch the force a year earlier, but a surprise attack from English sea captain Sir Francis Drake devastated his fleet after catching it unawares at Cadiz, southern Spain.

The hugely successful raid earned the name - Singeing the King of Spain's Beard - after a conversation between Drake and Elizabeth I.

When asking for permission to launch the surprise attack, the navigator is believed to have told the Queen he wished 'to singe the King of Spain's beard as it has grown somewhat too long'.

The current monarch, Felipe VI, who succeeded to the throne on June 19 2014 following the abdication of his father, King Juan Carlos I, will no doubt hope his face fuzz brings him better luck. 

A model of the 43-year-old was recently unveiled at the Wax Museum in Madrid bearing a smooth face - without the king's salt and pepper beard.

An English monarch has not sported a beard since George V - whose famous bushy whiskers were a thing of legend.

But with the current trend it seems only a matter of time before this changes.

Both Prince William and Prince Harry have been known to grow face fuzz and earlier in the year the Queen issued Harry with an order to shave.

Harry, 30, sprouted the beard last December while on his Walking With The Wounded charity trek to the South Pole - and the Queen was said to be displeased when he hadn't got rid of it a week later.
