An Ayn Rand novel written, temporarily shelved and later published as a play is finally being released in its original form.

Coming soon: Ayn Rand's novel 'Ideal' will be published July 7, the New American Library said

The New American Library, an imprint of Penguin Random House, announced Thursday that Rand's 'Ideal' would be published July 7.

'The arrival of a never-before-seen Ayn Rand novel will thrill dedicated readers and is a true publishing event,' New American Library's vice president Kara Welsh said in release. 

Rand had worked on the novel, about a Greta Garbo-like actress and the fans she confronts, in the mid-1930s. 

Protagonist Kay Gonda 'pleads for help from six of her most devoted fans: an upstanding family man, a farmer, an artist, an evangelist, a wealthy playboy, and a lost soul,' the release said.

In the story, Gonda asks her fans for help and says she has been accused of murder, the release said, per Publisher's Weekly.

Unhappy with how 'Ideal' turned out, Rand turned the novel into a play, which came out in 2005's 'Three Plays'.

Next summer's publication will include both the novel and the play.

Dr. Leonard Piekoff first read 'Ideal' after Rand's death before he put it in the Ayn Rand Archives, Publishers Weekly reported.

Then, the Ayn Rand Institute's Richard Ralston discovered the book as the archives were being saved digitally. He directed Peikoff to the work, according to the trade magazine.

The book is set to include an introduction from Peikoff.

Rand, who died in 1982, is still widely read and is known for the million-selling novels 'Atlas Shrugged' and 'The Fountainhead,' both of which have been adapted for film. 

In 2013, the Ayn Rand Institute claimed that 29.5million copies of Rand's books have been sold. 

'Atlas Shrugged' is widely known for a speech delivered by character John Galt. The sentence 'Who is John Galt?' regularly appears on bumper stickers and other merchandise.

Rand herself came to be known as the founder of the Objectivist movement. Individualism and laissez-faire capitalism are two tenets supported by the philosophy.

The New York Observer wrote that during Rand's lifetime 'To the left, she was a reactionary, a fascist, a capitalist pig who advocated for a complete separation between government and economics, limitless individualism and the virtue of selfishness. 

'To the right, she was an atheist; to moderates, an absolutist.'

Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, radio host Rush Limbaugh, and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas have counted themselves as fans of Rand's work.

Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, and Rob Lowe, Hugh Hefner, Mark Cuban and Billie Jean King are just a few of the many celebrities that have  voiced their support for Rand's philosophy and writings, Mother Jones reported in 2009.
