The image of the lazy student should be consigned to the history books, according to the minister in charge of the nation’s universities.

Instead of ‘dossing around’ fantasising about revolution in Latin America, the new crop of undergraduates work for longer hours, miss fewer lectures and complain about homework not being marked on time.

Tory minister David Willetts told MailOnline students are now ‘more-serious minded’, and willing to complain if their university is not giving them the £9,000 education they are paying through fees.

Instead of skipping lectures to stay in bed, today's generation of students are demanding more from their universities to get value for money for their £9,000 tuition fees

Instead of clutching a copy of Karl Marx today’s students are more likely to be perusing the complaints procedure at their faculty, Mr Willetts claims.

Mr Willetts said: ‘My experience now going to meet students is that they are not, by and large, plotting Marxist revolution in Latin America.

‘They are instead frustrated that their seminars are too crowded, it takes too long to get an academic to resound to their academic work.

‘There are always individual students who aren’t focused and who are just dossing around.

‘But overall they are more serious-minded than ever.’

Latest figures show an increase in the number of hours students spend working, albeit a modest one. 

Mr Willetts believes it is in part fuelled by students demanding value for money since tuition fees were increased to £9,000.

The survey by the Higher Education Policy Institute of first and second year students found 29 per cent thought their course was poor value for money.

‘Universities do need to do more to raise the quality of the academic experience, Mr Willetts said.

‘The student experience in English universities has not been good enough and at last it is beginning to improve.’

The minister points out that in extreme cases the worst universities could end up in court for breach of contract.

‘The structure of fees, although they don’t pay the fees upfront, has given them a real claim on the universities,’ Mr Willetts said.

‘Students do have rights: ultimately universities have to provide them with up to £9,000 of education.’

And if they don’t, the universities could find themselves being sued.

‘Ultimately there is a legal contract for the university to deliver services. That doesn’t mean we want lots of people pursuing universities through the courts.

‘But there is this body, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator, which will try to resolve student complaints if they can’t be done through the university.’

More than 20,000 students complained to their universities last year, a 10 per cent rise on 2010-11.

Top of the complaints are class sizes and lecturers taking too long to respond to questions and mark essays.

Latest figures show that students attend more than 9 out of 10 lectures, and most of those they miss are because they do not think they are worth their time. 

Bright teenage girls should not fixate on becoming doctors because there are not enough places to study medicine, David Willetts warned.

The universities minister said limits on places based on NHS demand for staff meant courses were always oversubscribed.

He highlighted the problem of students, especially girls, only studying A-levels needed for medicine such as chemistry and biology. 

'The subject which is most oversubscribed where people are sadly least likely to get to fulfil their ambition is medicine,' Mr Willetts said.

'Within that it is particularly girls applying for medicine.

'If they have given up physics at GSCE despite perhaps having got a good GCSE because it’s medicine that they are thinking of, it is hard for them to move across and convert to doing another form of science or engineering.

'They are all interested in science but it is medicine they are untested in so they don’t need physics for medicine so they drop the physics.

'There are lots of other ways of doing science which also make the world a better place, and not place all your bets on the medical option.' 

First and second year students on average had 14.2 hours of time-tabled sessions scheduled and attended 12.9 hours.

Asked why they missed lectures, half said they did not find them 'very useful' and 41 per cent said they did not need to attend because they could find the notes online.

Just 31 per cent of those who missed sessions said they 'couldn't be bothered to attend'.

Some students are now so fed up with the quality of their courses they have carried out analysis of the amount - and quality - of the tuition they receive to see if they are getting their money’s worth.

In 2010, the coalition controversially trebled the maximum amount universe is can charge in tuition fees to £9,000.

To date there has been little impact on the numbers of people still wanting to go to university - in part because they only start paying it back after starting work and earning more than £21,000.

Economics students in Manchester are demanding fewer multiple choice exams - which are easier to mark - and more open-ended essays which will take more time for their lecturers to assess.

Some 35 per cent of students surveyed said it took more than three weeks to have an assignment marked and returned to them while a quarter complained about not always getting prompt feedback.

Overall 87 per cent said they were satisfied with the quality of their course, but 13 per cent were dissatisfied

Mr Willetts added: ‘I think increasingly students are more serious minded. There is a slow and modest rise, but nevertheless the trend is the amount of hours of academic work done by students appears to be going up.

‘Talk to a student union and you are as likely to get complaints about how long it takes to get an essay back with a mark and feedback from an academic than anything about wider politics.

‘So yeah I think they are more serious.’

Despite the rise in fees, he insists it is still worth going to university.

According to the latest Graduate Labour Market Brief, the average salary for graduates with one degree is £32,000, compared to £20,000 for non-graduates.

‘That kind of brings home in a vivid way the scale of the gap,’ Mr Willetts added. ‘Individuals will obviously decide for themselves. It is not the right thing for every individual. But overall yes it is the right thing.’
