A vast unexploded Second World War bomb has brought chaos to the biggest airport in Holland  disrupting the journeys of thousands of travellers - including many Britons.

Builders digging around Terminal C at Schiphol Amsterdam uncovered the device wedged deep underground.

It will lead to questions as to how a major airport used by 45 million people a year could have built over a live bomb.

Danger: A terminal was closed at Schiphol Airport after workmen discovered the unexploded WWII bomb

Shocking discovery: The potentially lethal device was found during excavation works at the airport

The terminal, from which flights regularly leave for a number of British airports including London City, was immediately closed, with flights cancelled.

‘This has had a big impact,’ said an airport spokesman. ‘Delays and cancellations are inevitable, and many people will be caught up in the problems. A major evacuation has already taken place.’

The spokesman said an army bomb disposal team had arrived at the scene after the discovery of the bomb soon after dawn today.

Because of the age of the device, it is likely to be many hours, if not days, before the bomb is declared safe and can be removed.

The find comes after thousands of people were evacuated from 
their homes in Munich, Germany, as experts tried to defuse a 550lb WWII bomb found beneath 
ground at the site of the former Schwabinger 7 nightclub - a hangout of the 
Rolling Stones in the 1970s.

The awesome power of the explosion gave 
an insight into the devastating impact of wartime bombing raids when 
thousands of tonnes of explosives were dropped by Allied aircraft.

Controlled blast: Could the unexploded bomb found at Schiphol Airport be detonated in a controlled explosion like a similar-sized device was yesterday in Munich, Germany?

Menace: Thousands of unexploded WWII bombs (like this one found in Munich, pictured), are thought to be buried across Europe

The spokesman warned passengers to check their flights before departure so as to avoid long waits at the airport. 

The bomb is thought to have been dropped by the RAF or American Airforce during raids between 1940 and 1944, when Schiphol was used by the German Luftwaffe.

There were regular day and night raids on the then military airbase, especially because the Nazi airforce could use it to launch raids on nearby countries including Britain.

Allied bombs weighing 550lb were regularly dropped, all containing complicated chemical fuses which could trigger at any time.

The RAF and USAAF dropped huge payloads of bombs on Nazi positions all over the Netherlands, as part of the 2.8million tons used to flatten vast areas of German-occupied Europe.

This figure compares to the relatively small figure of 75,000 tons of bombs unleashed by the Luftwaffe on Britain.

Even though the war ended 67 years ago, ordnance is still found all over Holland, just as it is in neighbouring countries such as France, and Germany itself.

However, it is highly unusual to find a bomb in a heavily populated area like one of the world’s biggest airports.

Some 48million people travel through Schiphol every year – ensuring that questions will be asked as to how one of its major terminals was allowed to be built on top of an unexploded bomb.

A major enquiry is expected to be launched in to today’s find.
