A web user believed to be a Californian man arrested over the murder of his army veteran roommate earlier this year was warned on a chat forum that his posts sounded suspicious.

When 36-year-old Maribel Ramos went missing on May 2, her friend Emily C started a Yelp thread to try to find her.

But according to Vice, when online comments allegedly coming from Ms Ramos's roommate Kwang Choi Joy, with the username KC, appeared it raised suspicions among others on the web forum.

Accused: Kwang Choi Joy has been charged with the murder of Maribel Ramos

Ms Ramos, who served in Iraq before returning to Santa Ana to go to college, was reported missing after she uncharacteristically failed to attend several events.

Right before Ms Ramos disappeared she had 
asked Joy to move out, her family said. Neighbors had reported Joy 
acting suspiciously since her disappearance.

Her body was found two weeks after her family reported her missing. It had been left in bushes and was found after residents reported a foul odor.

Joy, who had attended vigils for his roommate and spoke to several media outlets about the woman he described as his 'best friend', was later arrested and charged with her murder.

But according to Vice, the 54-year-old had raised suspicions on Yelp that he knew something about the student's disappearance.

An online user, named KC, claimed to be the missing woman's roommate and spoke of her in the past tense

A person named only as Grant K joined the thread to say he thought the post from KC was odd

In the thread started by Emily on May
 8, a person believed to be Joy joined the conversation, posting on May 
13 that they were 'Maribel's roommate. She is my bff and only family'.

But
the person claiming to be the roommate, and with the username KC, 
then started referring to Ms Ramos in the past tense, even though her
 body had not been found.

'We had so much fun together. I miss her so much. She always knew that I will give my life for her,' the post read.

The
 comments led another user, Grant K, to point out that it was odd KC had
 spoken of Ms Ramos in the past tense, and questioned why the roommate 
was claiming to be close to her when it was known that she had asked him
 to move out before she went missing.

KC posted that Ms Ramos was the beneficiary to his life insurance, which further raised suspicions on Yelp

The last comment KC made on the site was to thank Daniel J, who had highlighted how his comments may appear to others. Joy was arrested the following day

The day of the arrest, Grant K returned to the Yelp thread to remind others that he had 'solved the case' days earlier

KC, who used a photo of Joy with the 
victim as his profile picture, responded by saying that his grammar 
wasn't good because English was his second language.

He added: 'Please do not speculate or make a judgement on me ... I know that everyone is looking at me that way.'

But the online user then heightened suspicions again when he returned to the thread a few days later, claiming that as well as Ms Ramos being his 'only family and bff' she was also the sole beneficiary to his '$250,000 life insurance' and bank account.

That post, made on May 16, quickly led to another member of the internet forum reaching out to KC to suggest that he be careful about what he writes.

The user, Daniel J, wrote: 'This is not an accusal, just a personal observance ... the stuff you write makes you susceptible to doubt.'

He added: 'You may be outraged that I am pointing this out, but I'm just showing you what an uninvolved third party might think.

The body of army vet Maribel Ramos, 36, was found nearly two weeks after she was reported missing

Maribel Ramos had allegedly asked KC Joy to move out of her apartment just before she disappeared

Maribel Ramos was last seen on May 2. Two weeks later her body was found in the brush near Modjeska Canyon

KC made one final post, thanking Daniel J for his advice. The following day - May 17 - he was arrested for murder.

It is not clear if police were aware of the online conversation on Yelp, or if the person posting as KC really was Joy.

However, Grant K returned to the Yelp thread after Joy's arrest to point out that he had accused the roommate of being involved nearly a week before his arrest.
