A heart-stopping video of a terrifying parachuting accident in the skies over Turkey has emerged online.

The video, captured using a small camera on the thrill-seeker's front, shows the chute ripping during a tandem paragliding flight in the resort of Oludeniz.

The dive went dangerously awry as the skydiver attempted a complex aerial manoeuvre, causing the guidelines to become tangled.

The camera lurches around as the pair desperately spiral towards the ground.

Fear: The unnamed man was attempting a complicated manoeuvre which went dangerously awry

Horrifyingly, the chute ripped into two parts after the ropes became tangled

Spinning out of control: The thrill-seeker desperately tries to regain control of the situation

Fortunately, he manages to deploy an emergency parachute - and the pair are able to land safely in the sea.

Last month a daredevil attempting a 6,500ft paragliding jump narrowly cheated death after his parachute became tangled in mid-air, also in Turkey.

Justin Clarke, a 43-year-old IT consultant from Norfolk, had launched himself off the 6,200ft-high Mount Babadag.

Safe: The men are able to deploy emergency chutes and land safely in the sea

Shortly afterwards, the lines of the thrillseeker's parachute became twisted, causing him to lose control of the glider.

A small camera strapped to Mr Clarke's body captured the moment he began hurtling towards the sea.

Despite remaining calm, he is shown desperately trying to re-gain control of the glider before opening up his reserve parachute.
