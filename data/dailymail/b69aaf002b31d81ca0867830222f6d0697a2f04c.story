Desperate: A friend said 63-stone Georgia Davis had moved away from her parents in an attempt to lose weight

A 63-stone girl who had to be rescued from her own home had previously moved away from her parents in a desperate attempt to lose weight, her friend and former housemate has said.

Georgia Davis, 19, moved in with friend Jade Tarrant but put on weight after she returned home to care for her sick step-father.

Miss Tarrant revealed today how Miss Davis's weight went from 18 stone to 63 stone as she returned to her bad habit of eating junk food.

Miss Tarrant, 19, said: 'I always knew it was going to get this bad if she went home again.

'She’d come to live with me because of all the stress. Being with the mum and her step-dad got so stressful.

'She just wanted a break - she wanted some girly time.

'She would have lost weight if she stayed with me because I like my salads and I could have got her on it.

'But she missed her mum and step-dad. She ended up going back and putting her own health at risk.'

Miss Davis moved out of their shared home in Aberdare, South Wales, to move back into her parents' home three miles away after her step-father was diagnosed with lung cancer.

She tried to be good daughter as her mother struggled with osteoporosis, Miss Tarrant said.

But the stress led to her returning to a diet of cakes, chips, burgers and chocolate, washed down by sugary fizzy drinks.

Miss Tarrant added: 'If she’d stayed with me her life would have been good, she would have been happy and not had a so many problems on her mind.

'It was the strain of caring for her ill parents which made her eat - it was eating as a way of coping.'

She thinks the world of her mum, she loves her and she loves her step-dad - she’s been through a lot.

'Her mum’s osteoporosis and her step-dad’s lung problems had a large impact on her.

'It went wrong when she moved back in with them, she was under a lot of stress and it put her back on the same spot.

'She went back to eating fatty foods and having huge portions every time we went out for a meal.'

Miss Davis eventually stopped venturing outside altogether and, by the time a 40-man emergency team cut her free, she had not left the house for about eight months.

The teenager is being treated for a range of obesity-related problems at hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales.

She is suffering from complications including diabetes and kidney failure, as well as problems with her spine, joints and skin.

Doctors and obesity experts have put her on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet to help her lose weight.

Jade, who is currently pregnant with her first child, said: 'When I saw the situation I was in shock. I broke down and started crying.

Major operation: It took 40 people to rescue Miss Davis from her home after she fell ill last week

'I didn’t even realise it was her, It didn’t look like her, she looked so unhappy.

'I had a fear inside me that something would happen one day but never expected this.

'I really want Georgia to get well and get out of hospital so she can come and see me and my baby.'

A hospital spokesman said: 'Georgia is still undergoing investigations and receiving treatment from a range of health professionals.

'We are pleased to advise that her clinical condition is stable.'
