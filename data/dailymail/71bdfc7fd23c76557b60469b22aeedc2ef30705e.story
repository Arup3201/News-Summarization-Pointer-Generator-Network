A New York restaurateur claiming to be a descendant of Vlad the Impaler is set to open a £4million restaurant in London’s Mayfair.

Nello Balan plans to open a branch of Nello, his Italian restaurant on Manhattan’s Madison Avenue known for its outrageously expensive food.

Mr Balan famously does not disclose the prices of his specials at his already expensive restaurant, and recently charged an unsuspecting diner £175 for a portion of truffle pasta.

Flashy venue: Nello Balan is set to open a £4million branch of his New York restaurant Nello in London's Mayfair

A lease in Mayfair often involves a rent of £100,000 a year, but David Rawlinson, director of Restaurant Property plans to broker the London deal, believes that Mr Balan will have no problem paying on time.

Describing the Manhattan branch of Nello to The Times, Mr Rawlinson said: ‘It’s a café for the super-rich. It’s not for the price sensitive.’

Romanian-born Mr Balan may or may not be a descendant of Vlad the Impaler, the 15th century blood thirsty count who inspired Bram Stoker's Dracula, but the above is definitely true.

Controversial: Mr Balan, pictured with a Romanian footballer in his Manhattan restaurant, was last year sued by his staff for diverting $100,000 (£63,860) of tips to his daughter and driver

The prices at Nello are enough to make anyone’s eyes water and the restaurant is famous for not informing customers of how much they charge for their ‘daily specials’.

Like forefather, like descendant: Romanian native Mr Balan claims to be a descendant of Vlad the Impaler, the 15th century count that inspired Dracula

One recent guest at Nello’s learned this the hard way after he took a liking to the sound of a truffle pasta special – unaware that he was being charged $275 (£175).

‘For a moment I thought I was hallucinating,’ the customer wrote in a letter to the New York Times.

‘The meal for the three of us cost $400. How was that possible?

‘Easy. The pasta dish cost $275’

When the customer confronted the 
waiter about the outrageous bill he was told that he should have 
expected high prices at Nello because it had been in the location for 
over 20 years – and it is close to branch of French luxury brand Hermes.

This is not the only controversy surrounding Mr Balan.

Last
year he was sued by his employees for making them work 60-hour weeks 
without overtime and diverting $100,000 (£63,860) a year in tips to his daughter, 
his driver and managers.

In 2008 he failed in an attempt to sue a lingerie model who had borrowed his $5,000 umbrella and returned it broken.

He
has also been accused of leaking bills of famous customers, such as 
Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovic, something which he has vehemently 
denied.

Vlad the Impaler was born in 1431 in the citadel of Sighisoara, Transylvania.

His father was Vlad II or Dracul, a night in the Order of the Dragon - a secret fraternity created in 1387.

He did not get the 'impaler' moniker until after his death and was known as Vlad Dracula - the added 'a' means 'son of' and 'Dracul' means 'devil'.

Vlad Dracul was assassinated in 1447 in a coup by one of his relatives and Vlad Dracula became Vlad III.

He was released from the captivity of Sultan Murad II who had kept him and his brother as 'insurance' for his father's guarantee not to strike against the Turks.

He vowed revenge and employed the help of the Turkish cavalry to defeat the boyars who had taken his throne while he was in captivity.

He killed his father's murderer in 1456 and defeated Vladislav II to take over as new ruler of Wallachia.

He held a feast on Easter Sunday of 1569 and many of the boyar families were there. He had them arrested and those who could work were condemned to slavery.

Those who could not were impaled.

An earlier version of this article said that the London branch of Nello would open in Mount Street, Mayfair. We are asked to clarify that this is not in fact the case.
