Concerns: French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius questioned Romania and Bulgaria's ability to police their borders

France's foreign minister said last night that Romanians  and Bulgarians should be prevented from travelling around Europe freely.

Laurent Fabius is the second senior minister to call for restrictions.

He said there were serious security worries about criminals using the two impoverished countries as a way into other parts of the EU.

Referring to the Schengen Agreement, which allows people to move across 26 European countries without passport checks, Mr Fabius said: ‘If there is not a change in conditions, we won’t be in favour.

‘People coming from outside Europe could enter Romania and Bulgaria and then freely enter the rest of Europe.’

Bulgaria and Romania will join the so-called Schengen Zone next year, giving their citizens free movement.

His comments follow a call last week by interior minister Manuel Valls for all Roma gipsies to ‘return to Romania or Bulgaria’ because they are unable to integrate.

Their warnings about the failure of European ‘open border’ immigration policies echo concerns in the UK, as Britain prepares to let in thousands of Romanians and Bulgarians looking for work in 2014.

This summer, police blamed dozens of Romanian gipsies camped in London’s Park Lane for a surge in begging, pickpocketing and shoplifting.

Each EU country can veto the admission of a member state into the zone. A vote is expected this year, and Germany says it will oppose the entry of Romania and Bulgaria.

Temporary restrictions that imposed passport checks were put in place when the two countries joined the EU in 2007, and are due to be lifted in January.

But each EU country has the right to veto the admission of a member state into the Schengen zone and a vote is expected before the end of the year.

Last week, Interior Minister Manuel Valls caused uproar in the left-wing governing coalition by saying most immigrant Roma 'don’t integrate well in France'.

The European Commission immediately threatened sanctions against France for its policy towards the Roma community.

Three years ago the Commission’s vice president, Viviane Reding, sent a similar threat to former president Nicolas Sarkozy, saying that Roma expulsions had to stop.

The far-right National Front has made the issue a top campaign theme for March's municipal elections, warning of a new influx of immigrants if Romanian and Bulgarian citizens are allowed to travel freely without passports in the Schengen zone.

In March Germany too vowed to oppose Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen passport-free zone.

Interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich warned both nations if they insist on entry into the scheme ‘Germany will veto it and they will fail’.

The Netherlands also backs the ban. Britain is not signed up to the Schengen agreement.

Germany is undergoing an invasion of immigrants from both countries with many cities experiencing extreme social tensions as a result.

Meanwhile, a French court heard children as young as ten were part of a ‘criminal army’ of Roma immigrants run by a 66-year-old woman.

Details
 of the gang, which included 13-year-old wives allegedly ‘bought’ for up
 to £170,000, emerged in the trial of 27 men and women in Nancy, eastern
 France. All face up to ten years in jail after being accused of crimes 
from robbery to people trafficking.

Children
 were said to be expected to bring in £4,000 pounds a month from 
robberies. The defendants, who cannot be named, deny the charges.
