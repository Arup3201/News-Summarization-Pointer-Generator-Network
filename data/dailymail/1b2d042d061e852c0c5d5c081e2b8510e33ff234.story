Luiz Felipe Scolari told critics of his stumbling Brazil team to ‘go to hell’ as he prepares for the quarter-final against Colombia.

The Brazil coach, who won the World Cup with the team in 2002, is under massive pressure to deliver the country’s sixth title at the highest level.

As he prepared in Fortaleza on Thursday evening, the former Chelsea coach claimed his team already have one hand on the famous trophy.

Not impressed: Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has told his team's critics to 'go to hell'

Scolari said: ‘We know every match is knock-out and we can be beaten, but have a target. We talk every day about this. 

‘Was I the one who gave them the responsibility to win it? If we hadn’t done it in this way we wouldn’t have what we have from our fans. 

‘If you lose in the first round after the group stage that’s not the end of our lives. We’re going to continue as a manager and players but we go after the final. 

‘This is a path we’re going after and we have the skills to get there. Brazil continue in the tournament with one hand on the Cup.

‘But some opponents more difficult than others. They have different characteristics and we play Col respecting their football but they’re probably saying the same things.

‘If you like it you like if you don’t you don’t, just go to hell.’

High spirits: Neymar falls to the ground with a smile on his face as Marcelo, David Luiz and Oscar look on

Scolari 
has come under pressure from the Brazilian media after hand-picking a 
select few journalists to attend a private briefing with him last 
weekend.

He
 added: ‘I have always done this. I don’t just want to talk about Plan 
A, B or C. Sometimes I want to talk about atomic bombs.’

Scolari
 also explained the role of team psychologist Regina Branao after she 
addressed the squad after their penalty shootout victory over Chile in 
the second round.

Branao
 spoke with Brazil’s emotionally drained players after many of them, 
including captain Thiago Silva, Neymar and keeper Julio Cesar cried 
after the national anthem or after the penalty shoot out win.

The
 Brazil coach revealed that she does not get paid for her role with the 
national team and insisted she has a positive influence.

He added: ‘She isn’t paid anything. They love going to talk in a meeting. I’ve seen people write terrible things. 

‘She will talk to us again on Sunday or Monday. This is a broad conversation.’

Silva,
 who is captain of his country, also responded after criticism of his 
emotional well-being following the victory over Chile last Saturday.

The Paris St Germain defender said: ‘I overcame tuberculosis, I could have died - people are saying silly things.

‘My leader Felipao is beside me. He is the commander and he never went against me.

‘I don’t care what people think because they are not here alongside me every day and are not with me.

‘I
 am emotional and that is only natural. I am a human being.It doesn’t 
affect me at any time on the pitch. People are saying silly things. I 
don’t think it makes anything diff. I think it helps me. 

‘We need the support of the country. We don’t want anything negative to push us down.’
