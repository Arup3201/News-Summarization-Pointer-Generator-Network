Vitamin tycoon Dino Gulelmelli admitted second degree attempted murder in an 11th-hour deal ahead of his expected trial.Formal sentencing will be held next week.

In an exclusive interview Monica told the Mailonline: 'It’s surreal. I don’t know  - I don’t know how to feel I have mix emotions, it’s still shocking to me that he took the plea, I can barely believe this is happening.

Case closed:  Monica Olsen claims she was living in fear after her husband Dino Gugliemelli was arrested when he was taped offering a would-be hitman $80,000 to kill her during an acrimonious divorce

Going down: Guglielmelli (pictured here with one of the couple's daughters) faces nine years in prison. His lawyer said outside court today: 'Those tapes were pretty strong. Dino regrets what he said. He just lost and messed up'

'When I go to to court next week and hear him plead guilty then perhaps I will fully believe that justice has been served. At the moment I still feel that I am dreaming.'

The
 53-year-old, who once ran a multi million dollar beauty products 
business but filed for bankruptcy while in custody, also faces three 
years probation after serving his jail sentence.

Guglielmelli was embroiled in an 
increasingly bitter divorce with third wife Monica when he offered 
unemployed Army vet Richard Fuhrmann $80,000 to kill her.

Fuhrmann freaked out and called cops before secretly taping Gulielmelli discussing ways of killing Monica, 32.

Guglielmelli
 has spent eight months in custody awaiting trial after prosecutors 
discovered he had secretly wired $4.4 million out of the country and 
planned to flee.

The last-minute deal spares ex catwalk model Monica from testifying against the father of her two young daughters.

Guglielmelli,
 who has a son and daughter from his two previous marriages, appeared 
before  San Fernando judge. Lloyd Nash wearing an orange jump suit and 
appeared nervous.

Asked if he understood the terms of the plea deal, he was barely audible when he responded: 'Yes, your honor.'

No members of his family or friends were in court to support him.

Model mom: Monica gave up her catwalk career to have children and has since launched her own brand of skin care products. Her business with Dino was thriving until their relationship fell apart

Hit: Fuhrmann alleged in court papers that 'What I heard extensively, most continuously (from Dino), was when is this going to happen? Do we have a time frame? Is this going to be over soon?'

Outside, his lawyer Anthony Brooklier told Mail Online: 'Dino is devastated.

'He
 has four children and we were in a debate about the evidence against 
him. If he had lost it would have been life imprisonment.

'Those tapes were pretty strong. Dino regrets what he said. He just lost and messed up.

'Dino is a decent guy and wants to get on with his life.'

Mr
 Brooklier claimed Guglielmelli, who will return to court for formal 
sentencing next week, had not hidden money oversees or elsewhere,  

Assistant distrct attorney Emily Cole told Mail Online that Monica was happy with the plea deal.Montreal-born
 Monica gave up her runway career when she married Guglielmelli 10 years
 ago but developed her own successful Skin by Monica beauty line shortly
 afterwards.

She claims he became jealous and tried to destroy her career as their marriage broke down.

Relief:  Monica's spokesman, Sean Borg, said she's 'still very frightened and jumpy. 
Her husband was very controlling throughout their 10-year marriage

Furhmann was expected to be the star witness at Guglielmelli’s trial next month.

His friendship with Guglielmelli turned sour after Monica slapped him with a subpoena to give evidence during a custody hearing.

Furhmann
 said he didn’t mention Guglielmelli’s threats then but after 
Guglielmelli exploded in temper over his perceived disloyalty he feared 
the former waste disposal entrepreneur would find another hitman, according to court papers.

Guglielmelli
 and Monica were embroiled in an increasingly bitter custody battle over
 daughters Cienna, nine, and six-year-old Vandella when he allegedly 
tried to have her killed.
