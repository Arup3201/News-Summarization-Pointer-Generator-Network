An accountant has grown the world's biggest melon and smashed his way into the record books with his mammoth 350.5lb fruit

Chris Kent, from Sevierville in Tennessee, entered his prize fruit into the 2013 Pumpkin and Fall Festival in Hamilton in Ohio and came away victorious for the second time.

The Great Pumpkin Commonwealth - a sanctioning body for contest of giant fruits and vegetables - was conducting one of its annual weigh-offs and declared his giant melon was an incredible 42.5 lbs heavier than the previous world record, set by Gabriele Bartoli in Italy in 2012.

'This one is, without any doubt, the world's largest watermelon, in terms of length and circumference,' Mr Kent said.

'There's never been one grown that's been this big. But is it heavy enough to break the world record? I don't know.'

Mr Kent added: 'You can eat them. They're not as sweet as a store-bought watermelon though. The flesh inside is a little more coarse and it's not as sweet.'

Verdict: The Great Pumpkin Commonwealth declared his giant melon was an incredible 42.5 lbs heavier than the previous world record, set by Gabriele Bartoli in Italy in 2012

Proud: Mr Kent poses with his record-breaking offering

Rumours of another mighty melon were rife at this year's contest but at 316lb it was not big enough to steal the title from Mr Kent.

'I'm extremely excited about it,' he said. 'It's a relief. I'll be able to sleep tonight.'

It's the second time he has entered into the record books with his colassal fruit.

In 2010, his 291-pounder shattered the previous world record of 268lbs.

He has become somewhat of a celebrity in the fruit and vegetable growing network in the US, and now worldwide.

Now Mr Kent plans to produce another champion melon by packaging and selling the seeds to other giant growers.

Seeds from a record-setting champion could go for as much as $40 for a pack of three to four seeds.

'There should be over 1,500 seeds in here,' he said.

'We all share seeds and trade them back and forth. They have auctions in the winter time to raise funds for the clubs and stuff.

'There's a lot of camaraderie among growers worldwide now, with the internet and stuff but there's also a competitiveness about it.'
