A Chinese advertising agency boss slaughtered his ex-girlfriend, her mother, sister and three-year-old niece with an axe in a fit of jealousy after her family banned her from seeing him.

Xiang Jan, 39, said he was furious having spent a small fortune trying to win the heart of Yang Kao, 28, when she dumped him because her family had told her he was not a suitable partner.

Xiang spent several weeks trying to persuade the young woman to change her mind but then discovered that the girl's family had managed to find her a new partner and given her their blessing to marry him.
