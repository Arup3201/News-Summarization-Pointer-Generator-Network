The manufacturer of the most popular brand of wrist-worn fitness gadgets has been deluged with complaints that their latest device has caused a raft of skin complaints including rashes, blisters and peeling skin which in some cases have left permanent scarring.

The Fitbit Force was launched late last year and retails for $130. It is the latest device from Fitbit, which sells a range of activity trackers that can measure steps, stairs climbed, calories burned and sleep.

Within weeks of the device launching last November, users started to complain about a rash appearing on their skin underneath the device’s charging port.

Fitbit, the manufacturer of the most popular brand of wrist-worn fitness gadgets, has been deluged with complaints that its latest device has caused a raft of skin conditions including rashes, blisters and peeling - which in some cases have left permanent scarring

Launched late last year the Fitbit Force retails for $130 and can measure steps, stairs climbed, calories burned and sleep. It also includes a full OLED screen, while the previous model only had indicator lights

Concerned users have taken to social media to air their concerns and since mid-December the company’s online forum has amassed more than 25 pages of comments from concerned and angry users posting grim photos of the markings that have appeared on their skin.

In a statement, Fitbit has claimed that ‘numerous factors’ may ‘cause skin irritation,’ including sensitivity to the device's stainless steel, which contains nickel, ‘reactions to bacteria that can accumulate in wristbands, or a sensitivity to the material of the band elastomer.’ 

The company has said it will refund or exchange the device, but on the Fitbit forum many angry customers are demanding compensation for visits to their doctor and creams to cure the problem.

It is unclear what is causing the reaction, and some people who have posted in the forum have said they didn't have any issues with the Force's predecessor, Fitbit Flex, which also has a stainless steel clasp that contains traces of nickel, reports Consumerist.

The key difference that the Force has over Fitbit's previous model, the Flex, is that is now includes a full OLED display compared to the previous model which only displayed indicator lights.

Feel the burn: Since mid-Dec the Fitbit user forum has received more than 25 pages of people complaining about their latest wrist-worn product and posting grim photos of their injuries

Several rash victims have complained on the Fitbit forum that they had posted their complaints on the company's Facebook page only to find they had been taken down by the company

Several person have also expressed their anger at Fitbit deleting comments and photos posted on the company's Facebook page.

'It's just not acceptable that you pay $129 for a product and then end up seeking professional medical help for a rash that develops from use of that product,' said Susan Pomeroy, a 63-year-old fitness instructor from Lawrence, Kan., who said she went to the doctor last month after developing a rash under her Force.

She was diagnosed with contact dermatitis and given a prescription for prednisone, said she was frustrated that the company hadn't made an official statement or warned people.

'I am concerned for the health of others,' Pomeroy said.

The market for wearable devices with sensors that can connect to an app and collect fitness data has exploded in the past 18 months and Fitbit has emerged as the market leader.

Market leader: Fitbit was responsible for 68 percent of the full-body trackers sold in the year ending Jan. 4

Unhappy customers have taken to the Fitbit forum to voice their unhappiness with how the company is handling the problem

In a statement, the manufacturer has suggested users may have an allergy to nickel which is contained in the device's stainless steel back

Another poster on the Fitbit forum outlines the treatment that they've gone through to try and cure the mystery rash that has appeared beneath their device

According to NPD Group, a market research firm, Fitbit was responsible for 68 percent of the full-body trackers sold in the year ending Jan. 4.

It has also received many favourable reviews from critics and earlier this month TIME magazine ranked the Fitbit Force as the best fitness tracker on the market after apparently comparing 26 different devices.

‘With a slick, OLED display, the streamlined Fitbit design, a broad set of features, and fully-automated syncing (at least with Apple and Samsung’s recent phones), you can’t do any better than the Fitbit Force,’ wrote TIME.

Fitbit has released the following statement:

We are aware that some of our customers have reported a skin irritation from wearing their Force device. We conduct testing in order to satisfy a variety of internationally accepted standards relating to the safety of the materials in our devices.

Fitbit wristbands are made of an elastomer material similar to many sports watches and do not contain latex.

The Fitbit Force clasps and casing are made with a surgical-grade stainless steel, which is commonly used in watches, jewelry and other products in contact with the skin.

As with any jewelry or watch, numerous factors could cause a skin irritation, such as nickel sensitivity (surgical stainless steel is an alloy containing traces of nickel), reactions to bacteria that can accumulate in wristbands, or a sensitivity to the material of the band elastomer.

However, our customers are our top priority, so we already have been taking steps to make this right with any customers who feel that they have an allergy related to their Fitbit device including offering a refund or a choice of a replacement tracker.

Fitbit will handle all shipping costs and will provide a refund in any difference in price.
