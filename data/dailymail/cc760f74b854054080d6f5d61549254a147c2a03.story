Gold Coast council members have directed travel companies to shun using the term 'tourism' ahead of the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

The move started with Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate sending a letter to Gold Coast Tourism, in which he advised the city linked organisation that 'tourist' now carries unflattering connotations.

Gold Coast Tourism have instead been directed to use the term 'visitor' in all of their brochures and internal documents, in a bid to appear more welcoming towards travellers.

In addition to the letter, Mayor Tom Tate has updated the City of Gold Coast Communication Guide to change the terminology from 'tourists’ to 'visitors.'

'Visitors’ will now be referred to in all Gold Coast brochures, documents and reports.

Mr Tate believes tourist is not an endearing term, and could in fact sour the experience of the cities 12 million annual visitors.

Mayor Tate told Daily Mail 'We have set ourselves an ambitious target of doubling overnight visitor expenditure by 2020, and there's a better chance of that happening when more is done to make people welcome and comfortable.'

'The Gold Coast is Australia's favourite destination and I am passionate that everyone who visits gets to enjoy the best we have to offer' .

'The City will be doing its part and I've encourage business leaders and destination marketing groups, many Council owned, to follow our lead.' 

Mayor Tom Tate said the term tourist was not endearing, and could hamper the experience of the cities 12 million annual visitors
