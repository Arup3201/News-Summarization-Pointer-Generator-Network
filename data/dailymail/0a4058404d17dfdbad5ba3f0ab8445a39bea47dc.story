If swallowing tablets invokes a fear of choking followed by unpleasant gagging and a nasty  taste in the mouth, there is now a little ray of hope.

While some people suffer the medical condition dysphagia - usually the result of stroke or conditions including multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's - most simply face a mental barrier.

But scientists in Germany believe they may have the devised a new foolproof guide to help people take their medication with ease.

Dr Walter Haefeli, who led the study at the University of Heidelberg, said he believes it will help people who struggle finish full courses of medication.

Scientists believe they may have devised two methods to help people who struggle to take tablets, pictured above are the 'pop bottle' and 'lean forward' methods

He said around 10 per cent of patients who struggle to swallow use it as an excuse not to take their tablets. 

The study examined 151 adults as they were given 16 differently shaped placebos, totally 283 between them.

Researchers looked at both traditional shaped tablets and capsules/

They found for both types, swallowing the pills with at least 20ml of water - around a tablespoon - was most effective.

After taking each pill the participants rated the ease of swallowing.

Researchers then asked them to try swallowing the tablets and capsules in specific positions, using techniques they had devised. 

They discovered the best way to take chalky tablets is the 'pop bottle' method.

CHALKY TABLETS

The researchers discovered the best way to take chalky tablets is the 'pop bottle' method.

This is where the tablet is placed on the tongue, the lips are tightly closed around the opening (of the bottle) and the tablet is swallowed in a swift suction movement.

CAPSULES

Here, the 'lean forward' technique' is best, the researchers say.

Capsules are swallowed in an upright position with the head bent forward.

Dr Haefeli said choosing which method to use depended on the shape of the medication.

'Capsules, with a density lower than water, will swim in the mouth and so head position matters.

'In contrast, to swallow tablets, which have almost always higher densities than water, it is necessary to focus on flushing the medicines into the pharynx [the cone-shaped passageway leading from the nose and mouth towards the oesophagus and voice-box].' 

This is where the tablet is placed on the tongue, the lips are tightly closed around the opening (of the bottle) and the tablet is swallowed in a swift suction movement.

However for capsules, the 'lean forward' technique' is best, the researchers say.

Here, capsules are swallowed in an upright position with the head bent forward.

In the study, volunteers were asked to try both methods and rate how easy it was to swallow the pills.

The 'pop bottle' technique improved swallowing by 60 per cent, while 88 per cent of those who tried the 'lean forward' method said it was easier. 

Dr Haefeli told the Guardian: 'Both the techniques we describe were remarkably effective in participants with and without reported difficulties in swallowing pills and should be recommended regularly.'

Dr Haefeli added that round tablets were found to perform worse.

The report stated: 'This study showed for the first time that two targeted techniques to facilitate tablet and capsule intake were remarkably effective and easy to adopt in the general population.

'This included patients with swallowing difficulties, and should therefore be generally recommended.'

The study was published in the journal Annals of Family Medicine.  

Researchers at the University of Heidelberg studied 151 adults taking 16 different placebo pills. The 'pill bottle' method was found best for those taking regular tablets, while the 'lean forward' technique helped those participants trying to swallow capsule pills
