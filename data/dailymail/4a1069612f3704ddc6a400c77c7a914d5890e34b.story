Hull City vs Swansea City (KC Stadium) 

Team news 

Hull City

Hull will be without defender Michael Dawson and midfielders Tom Huddlestone and Mohamed Diame for Saturday's clash with Swansea.

Dawson is facing at least a month on the sidelines with a grade two hamstring tear, Huddlestone is beginning a four-game suspension and Diame's knee complaint has yet to ease.

Loanee Hatem Ben Arfa has been told he will not play for the club again and Robert Snodgrass remains a long-term absentee.

Provisional squad: McGregor, Jakupovic, Davies, Rosenior, McShane, Robertson, Chester, Bruce, Elmohamady, Meyler, Livermore, Brady, Aluko, Quinn, Ramirez Hernandez, Aluko, Jelavic, Sagbo. 

Hatem Ben Arfa could be without a club in January as Newcastle United are unwilling to take him back

Swansea City

Lukasz Fabianski returns in goal for Swansea as manager Garry Monk has a fully-fit squad to select from for the Barclays Premier League trip to Hull on Saturday.

Fabianski missed last weekend's 2-1 home defeat to Tottenham through suspension after being sent off against West Ham and will reclaim the goalkeeper's jersey from Gerhard Tremmel at the KC Stadium.

Argentina central defender Federico Fernandez has trained all week after missing the last six games through calf trouble and could be in contention to play alongside skipper Ashley Williams at the back.

Provisional squad: Fabianski, Rangel, Bartley, Fernandez, Williams, Taylor, Britton, Ki, Shelvey, Routledge, Montero, Sigurdsson, Bony, Tremmel, Richards, Amat, Carroll, Dyer, Gomis, Emnes, Barrow, Tiendalli, Fulton.
