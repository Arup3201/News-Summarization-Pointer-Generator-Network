The son of the actor Nigel Davenport stalked his ex-girlfriend after she dumped him, a court heard.

Hugo Davenport was mourning the death of his father, who starred in Howards’ Way and Chariots of Fire, when Rebecca Jallot ended their 18-month relationship.

Unable to accept her decision, the 61-year-old responded by inundating her with messages, presents and letters.

Magistrates' Court in south-west London, accused of stalking his ex-girlfriend Rebecca Jallott (right)

Miss Jallot complained to police and, in March, Davenport was cautioned for harassment.

Claudius Taylor-Sonko, prosecuting, 
told Wimbledon magistrates Davenport resumed sending letters and gifts, 
including compact discs and Barclaycards.

He was arrested when he went to her home in Barnes, south-west London.

In a statement that was read out to 
the court, Miss Jallot said the incident had left her feeling ‘unsafe 
and anxious’ and she feared leaving her home or answering the door.

She added: ‘It is affecting my quality of life and I am concerned Hugo’s stalking has persisted. I am feeling harassed.’

films as A Man for All Seasons and Chariots of Fire and the TV series

Davenport pleaded guilty to stalking 
between March and July and was placed on an 18-month community order 
which includes a ‘better relationships’ course.

Rebecca Jallot

Educated at £34,000-a-year Westminster
 School, he is a journalist who wrote the book Days that Shook the World
 to accompany the BBC TV series.

His father Nigel, who died in October 
at the age of 85, played Lord Birkenhead in Chariots of Fire, which won 
three Academy Awards including best picture.

His half brother Jack Davenport, 41, starred in the TV series This Life and in the Pirates of the Caribbean films.

His sister Laura is also an actress 
and his stepmother Maria Aitken appeared in the films A Fish Called 
Wanda and Fierce Creatures.

Davenport told the court: ‘I’d like to
 say I’m very sad and sorry that a relationship that was once very close
 and very loving has ended like this.

‘I have had difficulties over the last
 nine months: my father’s death, even though it was not unexpected, and 
Rebecca’s decision to end our relationship.

‘I had hoped I would receive some sort
 of support from her. I only rang on her doorbell because I was 
delivering something to a friend nearby and there was no letterbox.

‘I had no indication there should be 
such an impact or feeling of fear. I now know all of these things and I 
bitterly regret my ill-considered actions and interpretations, which 
were because of my depression.

Hearing: Davenport, from Knightsbridge, appeared for sentencing at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court in London

‘This was someone I cared for very much, but now realise they don’t want anything more to do with me and I’ll abide by that.’

Sentencing him on Monday, district 
judge James Henderson said: ‘I accept you are showing genuine remorse 
but there was a degree of pre-planning and it was over a long period and
 on one occasion you went to her address.’

Davenport, who lives in Knightsbridge 
and has a son Bram and daughter Maia from his marriage to Sarah 
Mollison, was given a five-year restraining order preventing him from 
contacting Miss Jallot.

He was told to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.
