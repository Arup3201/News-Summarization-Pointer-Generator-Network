Mario Balotelli may be struggling to find the back of the net for Liverpool this season but he is also missing something else just as much - his pet, a pig named Super.

The £16million summer signing moved to Merseyside from AC Milan but he has been unable to transport his pet due to government restrictions on the import of animals.

Before Super is allowed to enter Britain, Balotelli must officially register himself as a breeder and then get an Italian vet to give the female pig a valid certificate of health before she can travel.

Animals can only be imported into Britain if certain regulations have been met.

If Balotelli wishes to transport Super the pig into the country he must:

- Register himself as a breeder of pigs with the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

- Receive a valid certificate of health from an Italian vet confirming that the pig will not bring any diseases or infections into the UK.

The 24-year-old hopes to be reunited with the black-spotted swine, bought while he was at AC Milan, in the coming months.

Balotelli gave the big its name due to his own nickname of 'Super Mario'.

A source told The Sun: 'His (Balotelli's) transfer from Milan took less time (than getting the pig to Britain).

'He's bent the ear of the people in the office, everyone. The lads have got to hear about it and the swines are giving him loads.

'He just laughs it off and talks about what great pets pigs are.'

The Italy striker has netted just once for Liverpool this season, against Bulgarian outfit Ludogorets in the Champions League.
