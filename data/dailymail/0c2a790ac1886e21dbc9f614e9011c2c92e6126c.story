Yet another small child has reportedly ingested a detergent pod as instances of accidental poisonings with the colorful gels continue to mount.

Thirteen-month-old Minnesota girl Zoe Mishler had been eating blueberries when she popped one of the dazzling blue laundry packets into her mouth.

Instead of a burst of berry flavor, the poor little girl received near-fatal chemical burns in her mouth and down her throat.

Calamity: A little girl named Zoe in Burnsville, Minnesota endured a week of intensive care after a detergent pod she bit into exploded down her throat

Enticing: Colorful packaging and bright, candy-like pods have likely helped cause some 20,000 cases of accidental ingestion since the gel packs became popular in 2012

Zoe spent a week in intensive care, reports KMSP, and remains in recovery at home where she requires frequent nebulizer treatments to her burned throat.

For her mother Ellen Mishler, every moment of pain her daughter experiences is agonizing.

'All I wanted to do is take the pain away from her,' she told KMSP.

While wrenching, this family's brush with calamity is all but uncommon.

Zoe is one of over 100 cases of accidental detergent pod ingestion this year in Minnesota alone.

While none of those have been fatal, not all children have been so lucky.

And according to Consumer Reports, some 20,000 calls have been made to poison control centers since the pods gained widespread popularity in 2012.

A mother's agony: 'All I wanted to do is take the pain away from her,' Ellen Mishler said as she recalled the terrifying days after her daughter's accident, from which the little girl is still recovering

Recovering: Zoe still requires frequent nebulizer treatments to help ease the suffering from her burned throat

Like in Zoe's case, ingestion can cause extreme burns, vomiting and diarrhea. In extreme cases, death can result.

Pod manufacturers like Proctor & Gamble have introduced more child-resistant tops to combat the problem.

Likewise, Sam's Club--which made the version of laundry pods that poisoned Zoe--says they're moving towards a safer product.

'Sam’s Club takes consumer safety seriously… we have added safety and cautionary language… and transitioned from transparent opaque pouches and tubs,” the company told KMSP in a statement.
