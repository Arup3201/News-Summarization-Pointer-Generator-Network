Liverpool have become the Premier League's best side on the road having claimed their seventh clean sheet away from home in Monday night's 1-0 win at Swansea. 

Brendan Rodgers' side also equalled Bill Shankly's club record of six consecutive clean sheets on the road having not lost a Premier League game in 2015. 

The Reds have conceded just 16 goals in 14 away games having faced the fewest shots - 169 - along with Manchester City.

Liverpool have enjoyed a fine run of form since the turn of the year and are in the running for a Champions League spot with the Merseysiders  just four points off second-place.

Manchester United and rivals City have conceded the same number of away goals as Liverpool while leaders Chelsea have conceded 17. 

Southampton's miserly defence have the best record for goals conceded though - letting in  just 11 goals away from home - while goalkeeper Fraser Forster has managed to keep four clean sheets.

The Saints' impressive displays at the back sees Ronald Koeman's side - tipped for relegation at the start of the season following a summer of upheaval - in the running for a place in the top four with nine games remaining.

Meanwhile, West Brom, currently 13th in the table,  have managed six clean sheets away from The Hawthorns this term. 

However, the big shock is perhaps the fact new manager Tony Pulis - who took over from Alan Irvine at the start of the year and is famed for tightening his teams up at the back - is responsible for just two of the six occasions the Baggies defence has not been breached. 

At the other end of the stats table,  relegation battlers QPR, Burnley and Leicester - along with Newcastle - have conceded the most goals on their travels.

West Brom have kept six clean sheets this season - the second-highest total in the Premier League this term

The trio of sides promoted to the Premier League last season have managed just four cleans sheets between them. West Ham, meanwhile, also have a poor record on their travels in terms of goals conceded having kept just one clean sheet away from home - against Southampton in February.

Leicester have conceded a huge 273 shots at goal away from home this season - the most in the division - with 87 of those on target.

Arsenal's defence have made an impressive 310 interceptions away from the Emirates this campaign, Crystal Palace have completed the most tackles with 334 challenges while Hull City have made 82 blocks - the highest number in the Premier League this term.
