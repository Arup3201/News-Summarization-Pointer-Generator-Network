In a shocking turn of events Jeneba Tarmoh has conceded her spot in the 100 meters rather than race against training partner Allyson Felix.

The two tied for third at the Track and Field Olympic Trials in Portland nine days ago. The top three finishers earn a spot on the team.

Tarmoh notified USA Track and Field on Monday of her intention to withdraw.

Too close to call: Jeneba Tarmoh (bottom) and Allyson Felix both cross the finish line for the Olympic trials with a time of 11.068. The race is decided by when their torsos cross the line, and the picture showed a tie

Her agent, Kimberly Holland, already 
made it known that Tarmoh would not participate in a runoff Monday night
to break a third-place tie at the U.S. track trials.

In an email sent through her agent to 
USATF, Tarmoh said: 'I understand that with this decision I am no longer
running the 100m dash in the Olympic Games and will be an alternate for
the event.'

USATF President Stephanie Hightower said the organization is 'disappointed' Tarmoh had a change of heart.

Felix will now race in both the 100 and 200 in London. Tarmoh didn't qualify in the 200, but is eligible to run in the Olympic 400-meter relay.

'The situation has been difficult for everyone involved,' Felix said in a statement. 'I had accepted the USATF decision and was prepared to run at 5 p.m. I wanted to earn my spot on this team and not have it conceded to me so I share in everyone's disappointment that this runoff will not happen. All I can do now is turn my focus to London.'

Felix sailed to victory in the 200m on Saturday night. Tarmoh, just left of Felix, did not finish in the top three in that

Tarmoh only reluctantly agreed to the runoff. She believed she won on the track fair and square nine days ago.

'In my heart of hearts, I just feel like I earned the third spot,' she said Sunday. 'I almost feel like I was kind of robbed.'

Tarmoh leaned across the finish line 
and looked up to see her name on the scoreboard in the third spot behind
winner Carmelita Jeter and runner-up Tianna Madison.

The 22-year-old Tarmoh even took a 
celebratory lap around the track, waving an American flag. She received a
medal and held a news conference.

Then, she found out about the dead heat from reporters.

The thrilling Olympic athletic heat 
which ended in a tie had the world talking as it was unprecedented.

The two female sprinters involved in 
the dead heat were offered the chance to decide their fate with the toss
of a coin, but opted to rely on their athletic ability instead.

Battle: The track timer had initially named Tarmoh, right, as the winner before officials reviewed the results

'I was pushed into a corner. They 
said if you don't make a decision, you give your spot up. I work too 
hard to just give my spot up. I had to say it was a runoff.'

The controversy in the 100 
overshadowed the entire trials simply because USA Track and Field had no
protocol in place to deal with a dead heat. USATF officials quickly 
scrambled to adopt a tiebreaking procedure.

The athletes had a choice between a 
runoff or a coin flip. They chose to settle matters on the track, not 
with the flip of a quarter.

'They both feel they deserve a spot 
on the team and they're willing to do it in a competitive manner and a 
competitive fashion,' USATF President Stephanie Hightower said on Sunday.

'I think
it's good for the sport and it's good for them to show their level of 
competitiveness and passion and drive for what they've been working so 
hard to accomplish.

'The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the best way to be able to resolve this issue.'

Disbelief: The two women finished dead heat for the third position on the women's 100m Olympic team

The resolution was delayed for eight 
days because their coach, Bobby Kersee, wanted to wait to make a 
decision until after 200m on Saturday.

Felix won turned in a personal-best 
time of 21.69 seconds, the fourth-fastest by an American.

Tarmoh finished fifth.

'I didn't get to really enjoy it,' 
Felix said. 'As soon as I came off, that's the first time that I 
actually thought about the process. Of course, I wasn't thinking I 
wanted to do a coin toss, but that's the first time I sat down and went 
through things in my head.

'Once this is over, I'll be happy about it.'

After two races and six rounds, both 
will be running with fatigued legs - so much so that Felix said she 
won't take any chances. If she steps into the blocks and does not feel 
right, she will pull out of the competition.

'We're both not feeling our greatest,' Felix said.

For Tarmoh, there is also an emotional component.

'I went to bed so happy and then I 
woke up to do something I don't want to do at all,' Tarmoh said. 'If 
it's in the best interest of someone's job or the sport, that's what 
I'll do.'

Support: The two women have the same trainer and
contracts with Nike

Anxious: Felix (right) is keen to compete in the Olympic 100m even though her main event is 200m

As for their friendship, Felix said 
it has not been affected by the situation. They both train under Kersee 
and were practicing starts together leading up to the 200m.

'There's never any question about any of that,' Felix said.

Since Felix had already earned a spot
in the 200m, there was speculation she might simply concede the 100m to
Tarmoh.

But Felix said the 100m is vital to her preparation for the 
200m, where she's a favorite to win Olympic gold.

'People may wonder, "What in the 
world? Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (of Jamaica) ran 10.70 and you're nowhere
close to that,"' Felix said. 'But it's about making my 200m better and 
giving it my all.'

The runoff is a boon for track and will be shown on NBC in conjunction with the network's coverage of the swimming trials.

'This will reintroduce people to the 
sport and showcase world-class athletes and great competition,' newly 
hired CEO Max Siegel said.
