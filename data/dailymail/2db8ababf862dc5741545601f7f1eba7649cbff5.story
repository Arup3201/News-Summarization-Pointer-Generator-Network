Clothing discovered in bushes near the car of a missing mother-of-four belonged to her, a friend has claimed.

Karen Johnson Swift, 44, has not been 
seen for 12 days after she was reported missing by her husband on October 30.

A pair of jeans and a grey zip-up top were found by the side of the road close to where Mrs Johnson Swift's car was abandoned, a quarter of a mile from her home in Dyersburg, Tennessee. 

Disappearance: Karen Johnson Swift was reported missing by her husband on October 30 in Dyersburg, Tennessee

A friend of the missing woman, Laura Jane, told The Huffington Post: 'They found her Halloween costume in 
the car.

'Some other articles of clothing that belonged to her - a pair 
of jeans and a gray zip-up - were found in some brush not far from her 
car.

'They confirmed [the clothing items] belong to her. They took DNA 
from her mother and compared it to DNA on the clothes.'

Calls to Sheriff Jeff Boxx, who is leading the investigation in Dyer County, by MailOnline were directed to his voicemail today.

Police would not confirm that the articles belonged to the missing woman until they had a full analysis from the state crime lab.

Sheriff Boxx previously told the Dyersburg State Gazette: 'We
are searching for anything of interest. And we are still inspecting 
other potential evidence, which we have recovered.'

Mrs Johnson Swift has two sons in college and two daughters aged seven and nine.

One friend, who would not be named, told local TV station WMCTV: 'She would not willingly leave us. We would like answers and we want her back.'

It is believed that Mrs Johnson Swift picked her daughter up from a Halloween sleepover at around 1:30am because she had not been feeling well and stayed with her daughter during the night.

When the child woke at around six am, her mother was gone. The youngest girl 'just cries' and will 'hardly eat' now, a family member told ABC.

On October 11, the mother-of-four had
filed for divorce from her husband David Swift but the couple remained living
under the same roof.

Mr Swift has been interviewed by police but has not yet been named as a person of interest in his wife's disappearance.

He told police he last saw his wife at home after she 
returned from the party to drop off their children.

It is believed her estranged husband has hired a lawyer and is no longer talking to the authorities.

None
of the family have spoken to the media about her disappearance but Mr 
Swift wrote on Facebook: 'We want her home and love her very much.'

Her vehicle, a white 2004 Nissan Murano was found with a flat tyre in a rural area.

Police have released new images of the car at the scene which it is hoped will help solve her disappearance.

Authorities are continuing to comb the area and have brought in helicopters to conduct aerial searches.

Another friend of the missing woman, Cathy Bona, said: You hear so many different things on a day-to-day basis about what's found that you don't know what to believe until you officially hear it.'

She added: 'I do believe they are doing 
all they can do. They are searching fields, ponds, rivers, looking 
everywhere they can with what information that they have.'

Friends will hold another prayer vigil for the missing mother-of-four in downtown Dyersburg tonight.

Friends of the woman have come forward, saying they suspect foul play because Mrs Swift would never voluntarily leave her family.

Carrie Engelhardt, a friend of Swift's, told FoxNews.com: 'It’s not in her nature. We’re really concerned and worried because it’s been over a week now.'

There are no signs of foul play and her disappearance was being treated as a missing persons case, Sheriff Boxx told KAIT.

The cell phone of the missing woman, who has 
blonde hair and green eyes, was also missing.

Police said it was last used at about 5am on Sunday when Mrs Swift 
accessed the internet on the device.

Police were working with the phone 
company to pinpoint its last location.

On Saturday, the sheriff's department arrested a neighbour who has been accused of poisoning two dogs, one of which belonged to the Swift family, in early October.

The suspect, 39-year-old John Hogshooter, was charged with animal cruelty in the case, according to the State Gazette.

The paper reported that Mrs Swift had tried to speak to Hogshooter about her dog weeks before she disappeared, but he was not home.

The sheriff's office has not said whether or not he is suspected of being involved in Mrs Swift's disappearance.

Vanished: Karen Johnson Swift's husband David told police that he last saw her at their home in Dyersburg, Tennesee

In
addition, her home in Dyersburg is just 80 miles away from where 
21-year-old nursing student Holly Bobo was abducted in Darden in April.

Six
months after that disappearance, her family are continuing their own 
searches and investigators are developing leads and working on the case 
daily.

But authorities can not yet be certain that the two cases are connected.
