Burnley’s talismanic forward Danny Ings has pledged to remain at the club until the end of the season.

The forward’s contract is due to expire at the end of this season and a number of clubs are understood to be interested in attempting to prise Ings away from Turf Moor in the January transfer window.

Ings produced another eye-catching performance during’s Burnley’s remarkable 2-2 draw at Manchester City on Sunday and Newcastle United, Southampton, Leicester City, West Bromwich Albion and German side Wolfsburg have all been credited with an interest in the England Under 21 striker.

Although Ings is less committal over his plans beyond the end of this season, he insists that he is going nowhere for now and that his focus remains on preserving Burnley’s Premier League status.

‘That was the plan,’ Ings said, ‘I’m contracted until the end of the season and that’s the way it’s going to be. Now I can fight for the team as much as I can and do my best for them.’

The 22-year-old forward, who has been watched extensively by England scouts this season, also maintained he will not be distracted by any offers that may come his way in January.

‘I won’t be looking at that. I will just take that sign as confidence and take it into my game and do as well as I can for Burnley.

‘Especially for a young lad, it’s quite easy to lose concentration for some people. But I’m not that sort of character. I’ve got a job here to do at Burnley and am contracted until the end of the season - and that’s the way it’s going to be.’

Burnley remain in the relegation zone but only courtesy of goal difference after a recent revival that has seen Sean Dyche’s lose only three of their last nine league games.

Burnley’s fitness has received particular acclaim after Dyche named an unchanged team for both the Boxing Day match against Liverpool and the draw at City, with the manager also electing not to make a substitution on Sunday.

‘We train as we play on a weekend,’ Ings explains, ‘You can’t just flick a switch and expect to perform, especially in this league.
