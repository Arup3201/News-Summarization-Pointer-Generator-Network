Letting her baking do the talking; Ruby Tandoh says she encountered a barrage of abuse

It is a show that is filled with the sweeter things in life; cakes, puddings and kind judge Mary Berry.

But The Great British Bake Off left a bitter taste in finalist Ruby Tandoh's mouth, who says she was subjected to 'lazy misogyny' in a torrent of online abuse.

Former model Tandoh, who clashed with TV chef Raymond Blanc when he suggested she was too thin to enjoy food, said she was 'surprised at just how much nastiness was generated from the show'.

Writing in The Guardian, she said: 'Despite the saccharin sweetness of the Bake Off, an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators, both on social media and in the press.

'Many took to Twitter decrying the demise of the show, voicing their hatred for certain bakers, and asserting (week after week!) that they would 'never watch it again' if X or Y got through that episode... How did a programme about cake become so divisive?'

Tandoh, 21, said criticism ranged from the gently cynical to the downright obnoxious, 'but as the series went on I noticed an increasing degree of personal vitriol and misogyny'.

She added: 'We (female) finalists are supposedly too meek, too confident, too thin, too domestic, too smiley, too taciturn.'

The contestant, who consistently won the applause from judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood on her instinctive baking skills, had been criticised for being emotional on the show.

Ruby's tears inside the Bake Off tent incurred the wrath of viewers, who shrieked insults at her online

In one episode, presenter Mel Giedroyc, dabbed her nose when she was weeping during a stressful bake, and on another occasion, at the behest of Tandoh, told her to 'get a grip'. when she became too flustered.

Some fans of the show grew frustrated with the university student, who they claimed was cunningly portraying herself as fragile to win sympathy from the judges.

But judge Paul Hollywood defended the young baker, describing her as 'one of the most talented bakers who has walked in that tent'.

As the runner-up became as much a talking point as her baking skills, chef Raymond Blanc waded in on the commentary to deride 'female tears' on the BBC2 show.

The
 63-year-old chef sparked anger when he wrote on Twitter, mistakenly 
referring to Tandoh as the show’s winner: 'The Great British Bake Off. 
Not much skills, female tears and a winner so thin who makes me doubt of
 her love for great cooking, baking.'

Tandoh hit back, writing: '@raymond-blanc ‘female tears’?! and what has anyone’s size got to do with it?

'I don’t care if you’re a patisserie king - don’t be an idiot.'

Blanc later apologised, tweeting co-host Paul Hollywood: 'Apologies if I upset people this morning. I would like to congratulate you on a show. Best Rb xx'

Tandoh wondered in the article: 'What are ‘female tears’, anyway? Are they more fragile and delicate than male tears? Do they wear pink?'

And she added: 'If a show as gentle as Bake Off can stir up such a sludge of lazy misogyny in the murky waters of the internet, I hate to imagine the full scale of the problem.'

Tandoh, who is studying for a 
philosophy degree, said in an interview with student magazine The Tab 
that she was not bothered by accusations of favouritism.

She
 said: 'It's easy to brush it off because I know how it was in the tent -
 and there was no favouritism. It was all very fair so that doesn't get 
to me very much.'

Despite the unexpected controversy around the finalist, the BBC2 show has pulled in the viewers and is set to move to BBC1 next year as a result of its rising ratings.

The
contest has had BBC2's highest viewing figures so far this year with 
an average audience of seven million.

The
audience has grown from an average of 2.8 million for the first series 
in 2010, peaking with 7.8 million a fortnight ago - more than even last 
year's final, which drew a total of 7.2 million.
