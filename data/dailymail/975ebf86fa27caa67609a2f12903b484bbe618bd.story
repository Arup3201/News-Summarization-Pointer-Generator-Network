Sickening: Three-year-old Olivia Pollard at Sheffield Children's Hospital. She nearly lost sight in one eye because of the collision

Police have released CCTV images in a bid to catch off-road bikers who ran down and then left a three-year-old girl for dead in a horrifying hit-and-run.

Little Olivia Pollard was struck and flung into the air as she crossed the road with her mother Jessica four weeks ago.

Three off-road motorbikes were travelling on a road in East Herringthorpe, South Yorkshire, when one or more of the bikes is thought to have collided with Olivia, before driving off.

The toddler suffered serious head and eye injuries, and came close to losing the sight in one eye.

She was airlifted to nearby Sheffield Children's Hospital following the shocking collision.

Thankfully, she has now been released from hospital and is recovering at home.

South Yorkshire Police are still appealing for information to help them catch the culprits - and today released CCTV images of three off-road motorbikes and four people in the hope members of the public will recognise them.

Inspector Geoff Young said: 'The response from the public has been excellent. We have received a number of leads and have spoken to several people as part of the investigation.

'Through the amount of CCTV we have now been able to recover and collate, we definitely know that there was more than one group of off-road motorbikes in the area at the same time as the collision and we are keen to identify the owners of the bikes and the riders.

'Olivia is expected to make a full recovery, however she is only a little girl and she has been through a horrendous ordeal. I would still urge the public to please come forward should they have any information they believe may assist the investigation.'

Speaking shortly after the accident, which happened on the afternoon of July 3, her devastated mother Jessica, 20, said: 'To think that people could do that to her and then drive off while she lies bleeding in the road makes me sick.

'We'd just got off the bus and were crossing the road when, out of nowhere, three motorbikes came darting round the corner.

'I tried to grab Olivia and screamed her name but she had just frozen from the fear of them coming towards her.

'She was right next to me but it all happened so quickly so I didn't have time to grab her. She almost went under the wheel of one of the bikes but the speed they'd hit her at meant that she bounced off and was flung a few feet down the road. She landed head first.

South Yorkshire Police have today released CCTV images of the riders they want to speak to

'I ran up to her and as I held her, a lad on one of the other motorcycles looked right into my eyes.

'I begged him to stay and help me and he just drove off with the other two. They could see that Olivia was seriously hurt because she was covered in blood and still they did nothing to try and help.

'I was a complete mess. All I could see was blood and Olivia was screaming asking me to help her and not leave her.

'It's disgusting that a three-year-old has been put through that.

'I feel so angry when I think of those lads. I'm begging anyone who might know who did it to contact the police. Justice needs to be done.'

Police would urge anyone who believes they may know the identity of the riders or the owners of the bikes, or who may have seen the bikes in the area at the time, to please contact the police on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111, quoting incident number 634 of 3/7/13.
