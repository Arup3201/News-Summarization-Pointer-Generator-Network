An aspiring actor has undergone extensive cosmetic procedures to look like movie heartthrob Ryan Gosling.

In nearly two hours of treatments, Nicholas Ryan, 32, from New Jersey, was give $5,000 worth of Botox and filler injections to make his face look like his hero.

He hopes the procedures will help him hit the big time in Hollywood - as well as improve his chances with women.

'I wanted was more definition in my 
jaw bone, like Ryan Gosling,' says the actor, who lives in Los Angeles and chose 'Ryan' as a stage name.

'I'm going for roles that 
demand a more rugged look in a man's face. My favorite Ryan Gosling 
movie is Gangster Squad, a role that suits that type of heroic face.'

He adds that 'women love Ryan Gosling', who he rates as a 'great actor.'

'He's
 got a look that a lot of 
people in America are looking for right now, especially in my line of 
work,' Nicholas says. 'I'm hoping I'll get more auditions and roles if I
 look more like Ryan Gosling. That's why I had the surgery.'

Before: Nicholas says he wanted more definition in his jaw bone to give a more rugged look...

After: A week later, with the swelling and some light bruising down, Nicholas is 'over the moon' with the results

The procedure saw Nicholas receive dozens of injectable fillers with a specific 
formulation of non-animal-sourced hyaluronic acid to plump out various 
parts of his face.

'I'm secretly excited how woman will react now I look a little bit more
 like their celebrity crush'

Beverly Hills surgeon Dr Tim Neavin,
 who specializes in Hollywood 
transformations and facial remodeling, operated on Nicholas on May 
7th.

He explained: 'The patient already shares some similarities with Ryan 
Gosling, but has some deficiencies, so we built those areas out to give 
him that squared-off jaw Ryan Gosling made famous.

'We filled out the temples and put a 
little Botox around the brow. Then we injected some product along the 
cheek junction, to make it a little smoother,' he said.

Major changes: Dr Neavin says he addressed the hollowness in Nicholas's face, and built out the jaw

'The biggest issue I wanted
 to address was the hollowness in the face. We injected more product to 
blend it with the cheekbone. The patient's laugh lines were also a 
little prominent, so we filled them in to smooth them out - this really 
gives the patient a youthful, well-rested appearance.

'He was deficient 
in the jaw, along its border, so we basically built out the entire jaw, 
squaring it off just like Ryan Gosling's.'

That, Dr Neavin says, is the 
'Hollywood' face you'll recognize from screen actors such as Ryan 
Gosling or Rob Lowe. 'Their faces are what we call the "aesthetic 
ideal". Perfection.'

No laughing matter: Dr Neavin also addressed Nicholas's laugh lines, which 'were a little prominent,' so filled them in to smooth them out - 'this really gives the patient a youthful, well-rested appearance,' he says

Costly: The entire set of procedures took two hours, and set Nicholas back by $5,000

And it seems Nicholas is not the only
 one who aspires to that look. The surgeon says male patients often 
bring photographs of Ryan Gosling into his surgery.

'Ryan Gosling is the 
must-have face in America,' he says. 'He is considered to be the sexiest
 man in Hollywood, and it's not just his charming smile and blue eyes.

'Gosling's face is what I call an "architectural masterpiece" in terms of bone structure, including a squared-off appearance between the cheekbones and jaw bone.'

A week later, with the swelling and some light bruising down, Nicholas is 'over the moon' with the results.

'The first time I looked in the 
mirror I was shocked at how much of a change it was, I looked so much 
healthier too,' he says.

The American Society of Plastic 
Surgeons says the number of procedures in men has increased over 106 per
 cent since 1997, and reports a sharp rise in facial rejuvenation.

The organization says that men had 
almost a million cosmetic procedures in 2012, including 
minimally-invasive treatments, which have become 
increasingly popular among those who aspire to the 'Hollywood look'.

'It was really shocking. Now, every morning, I 
have to check in the mirror to make sure it's still there!'

He
 says the similarities to the Hollywood actor are now unmistakable: 'I 
went to a pool party this week, like we do here in LA, and this girl 
came up to me and she said, "you have a very Ryan Gosling look to you." I
 couldn't believe it! After all the stuff I had gone through, it was 
amazing.'

Nicholas says the operation has not just made him look better, but feel better.

'By getting the procedure done it's definitely increased my 
confidence,' he says. 'I just look healthier, you know? Before I felt 
like my face was a little narrow and now I feel like the world is my 
oyster.'

Nicholas adds that he is already picking up more work since his transformation.

More confident: Nicholas thinks he looks healthier and says he is already experiencing a career boost

'Before now, my career was quite slow, but I'm just getting 
started,' he says. 'I've worked on a couple of television shows, and I just landed a
 new show.'

And as well as his career, Nicholas 
is keen to see how his new face will go down with the female population:

'I'm secretly excited how woman will react now I look a little bit more
 like their celebrity crush,' he says. 'Ryan Gosling does well with the 
ladies, hopefully so can I.'
