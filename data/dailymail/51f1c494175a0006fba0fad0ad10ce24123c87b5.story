A baby girl has been born in the middle of the snow storm chaos that has gripped the South, including Alabama and large parts of Georgia for the past 24 hours.

Grace Elizabeth Anderson arrived by the side of highway in suburban Atlanta on Tuesday afternoon after her parents got stuck on the gridlocked interstate.

The little girl was safely delivered after a traffic officer arrived with only minutes to spare when he noticed the family's car stuck by Interstate 285.

Nick and Amy Anderson had their two older daughters in the back when the third announced she was on her way into the world.

Police officer Tim Sheffield was responding to a call regarding an accident nearby when he spotted the family on the side of the road and stopped to check.

‘I asked the dad, ‘Are you all broke down?’’ He goes, ‘No, we’re having a baby”,’ Officer Sheffield told TODAY.

‘That baby was coming no matter what. They were both calm. They were troupers.’

‘And then the baby came out, it just happened quick. It was beautiful.’

Sandy Springs Police Capt. Steve Rose said little Grace was safely delivered around 5.20pm on Tuesday amid gridlocked traffic on Interstate 285.

'Fortunately he had his emergency lights on and people got out of his way,' Rose said. 'The delivery was pretty flawless.'

Officer Rose said the family were taken by ambulance to a hospital and were being cared for.

More than 24 hours after the storm, it is still not clear exactly how many people are still stranded on the Georgia, and search and rescue helicopters have been deployed to find drivers stuck on the roads.

Georgia State Patrol officials said two traffic fatalities had been reported in counties outside of Atlanta.

State troopers also responded to more than 1,460 crashes between Tuesday morning and Wednesday evening and said more than 175 injuries had been reported.
