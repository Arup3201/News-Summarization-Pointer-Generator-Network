Plans to allow childminders and nursery staff look after up to six children at once have been branded 'grotesque' by the government's own childcare advisors amid warnings that the quality of care could be hit.

Education minister Elizabeth Truss unveiled a major overhaul of the rules on who can look after children, the qualifications they need and the ratios of staff to children with the aim of having fewer, better-qualified staff.

But she came under fire for citing other European countries which allow nursery workers to look after more children than in Britain. Helen Penn, Professor of Early Childhood at the University of East London, said: 'The figures she gives seem to me to be rather grotesque.'

Nursery staff will be able to look after more babies and toddlers under radical changes to childcare rules

Ministers plan to relax the rules on carer-to-child ratios, to bring them more in line with other European countries

In a speech today, Miss Truss said that in a bid to drive down costs so 
better staff can be attracted by better pay, adult/child ratios will be 
relaxed.

Each nursery worker will be able to 
look after four under-two-year-olds, rather than three as now. The 
number of under-fives goes up from four to six.

Childminders will be able to have two babies in their care rather than one, and four under-fives, not three.

Officials point to figures which show that in Ireland, the Netherlands and France nursery staff can look after at least six children and in France up to 12.

Every parent will get help with childcare costs in a massive extension of government funding to cut bills.

Deputy PM Nick Clegg had initially suggested extra funding would be targetted at low-income families before insisting last week that he was ‘unambiguously in favour’ of giving more support to ‘the British middle classes’.

But today education minister Elizabeth Truss went further and promised all working parents would benefit.

Ministers are also finalising plans 
for £1.5billion in tax breaks for working families with young children, 
expected to be worth at least £1,000 a year to help pay for spiralling 
costs of childcare.

Miss Truss told the BBC: ''We want to help all families, all 
families who go into work we want to help with their childcare costs, 
we’re absolutely clear about that.' Details are expected to be announced in the Budget in March.

She was forced to deny the funding package had been watered down.

'It hasn’t fizzled out. It is coming,
it may be slightly longer in the gestation than would be ideal, but it 
is coming,' she told BBC Radio 4.

But Professor Penn told BBC Radio 4:' I think that Liz Truss simply got the figures wrong about the ratios in other countries. She has left out assistants, she has left out the number of children that might be with a childminder at any one time.

'The figures she gives seem to me to be rather grotesque.'

Professor Penn co-wrote a report for the government with Professor Eva Lloyd last year which warned relaxing ratios would lead to a 'deterioration' in the quality of care.

Today Professor Lloyd said: 'The ratio relaxation is unlikely to reduce childcare costs, but may well drive down childcare quality.'

Miss Truss insisted the choice on how many children are looked after in nurseries should be up to firms and parents.

'At the moment, many nursery and private, voluntary and independent settings do not use full ratios,' she said.

'We think teacher-led settings with full ratios and structured activities are a good thing. Ofsted will favour this too. We do not mean to stipulate how all settings should behave, but we want parents to have the choice.'

Setting out her plans to raise standards, she warned childcare workers need fewer 
qualifications than those working with animals.

Miss Truss expressed concern 
at the ‘hair or care’ stereotype of underqualified girls going into  
hairdressing or childminding.

In
a bid to drive up standards, the Tory education minister will insist 
nursery staff must have at least a C in GCSE English and maths.

The minister said: ‘Staff in this country earn about £6.60 an hour on average, only a little above the minimum wage. This speaks volumes for how much those working in the early years have hitherto been valued.’

Allowing better qualified staff to look after more children, the government hopes pay levels in the childcare sector will increase

New graduate level ‘early years teachers’ are to be specifically trained to teach young children.

Miss Truss said that ‘too many people who work with young children are under-qualified’.

Education minister Elizabeth Truss is expected to launch new tougher qualifications for people who want to look after pre-school children

‘Given what we know about early years 
development, it is no longer acceptable that childcare professionals are
not required to have a GCSE grade C or above in English and maths,’ she said.

Highlighting the contrast with abroad,
she added: ‘In France, at least 40 per cent of staff in crèches must
hold a diploma, which demands a three-year, post-16 course. In the 
Netherlands, certified childcare workers must train for two years 
post-18.’

Expert Government advisers have expressed concern at ‘the hair or care stereotype’, in which 
often students with ‘the poorest academic records’ are  steered towards 
childcare.

She quoted Helen Perkins, head of 
early years and childhood studies at Solihull College, who said: ‘We 
demand that students need a relevant qualification before they are able 
to handle animals independently on our animal care courses. Nobody 
demands the same level of qualification before you can be left alone 
with a baby.’

Older pre-school children do best in 
‘teacher-led settings’ with ‘structured activities’, which will be 
favoured by Ofsted, she will say. However, Labour’s shadow education 
secretary Stephen Twigg said the plans threatened child safety.

‘This Government has created an 
affordability crisis by cutting support and pushing up costs for 
parents. Watering down quality is the wrong way to try to deal with the 
problem they’ve caused,’ he said.

‘Experts are warning this could threaten child safety and won’t reduce costs. Parents will be worried.’

Chris Keates, general secretary of teaching union the NASUWT, said: 'No one doubts the importance of high-quality, affordable childcare.

'Seeking to drive down costs by packing more children into childcare settings compromises the quality of provision that is essential to the learning and development of the very youngest children.'
