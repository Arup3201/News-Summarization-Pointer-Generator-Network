Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been awarded France's top civilian honor at a low-key ceremony in Paris.

The 72-year-old billionaire blushed and grinned as he accepted the Legion d'Honneur - or Legion of Honor - from France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius at the Quai d'Orsay on Tuesday.

'Many thanks to Laurent Fabius and the French Legion of Honor, which embodies the ideals of liberty our nations share,' Bloomberg wrote on Twitter following the ceremony.

Bloomberg, who stepped down following his third term as mayor last year, is in France to speak about climate change at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development conference.

The Legion of Honor, which was created by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802, is the highest decoration in France 'created to honor extraordinary contributions to the country', according to the consulate.

The award is divided into five degrees: Knight, Officer, Commander, Grand Officer and Grand Cross - and Bloomberg was promoted with the Commander grade.

Bloomberg proudly shared a snap of the moment he received the award on Twitter, while Fabius also commended the achievement by tweeting an image showing the pair smiling together.

The former mayor has long nodded to France's support in the U.S.  

Chuffed: The award is the highest decoration in France and honors 'extraordinary contributions to the country'

While in office in 2011, he co-hosted an event at the Statue of Liberty with then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy to celebrate '125 years of friendship between New York City and France'. 

There, Bloomberg said the U.S. should not forget France's support during the American Revolution, while Sarkozy agreed France and the U.S. shared 'bonds of blood' and a common value of freedom. 

And last year - in a show of just how much he appreciates the country - he famously spent $13,300 on a custom copper bath made by skilled French craftsmen for his five-storey Manhattan home.

Bloomberg is not the first American - or New Yorker - to receive the award. 

Happy to be there: Bloomberg has previously thanked France for helping the U.S. throughout history

In 2006, former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly, who was in office under Bloomberg, was awarded the Légion d'honneur during a ceremony at the French consulate in Manhattan. 

Other notable American recipients include Walt Disney, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bob Dylan, Danielle Steele, Julia Child, Toni Morrison and the later-disgraced General David Petraeus.

In addition, most American veterans who served in France during World Wars I and II are inducted into the Légion d'honneur after they apply.
