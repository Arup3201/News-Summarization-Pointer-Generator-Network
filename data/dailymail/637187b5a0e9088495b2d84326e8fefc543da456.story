A British couple have been jailed for nine months after falsely claiming they were robbed by armed raiders at their home in Barbados.

Edward Denney and Tululla Salvatori told police that gunmen stole jewellery worth more than BDS$34million - or £10m - and BDS$2,000 cash - nearly £600 - from their home in the luxury resort of Sandy Lane, according to reports.

They were both jailed for nine months after pleading guilty to wasting police time when they appeared at Holetown Magistrates' Court last week.

Magistrate Barbara Cooke-Alleyne sentenced Salvatori to a further nine months, to run consecutively, after she admitted obtaining services of a hired car by deception, according to Nationnews.com.

It has been reported the couple told police two armed robbers assaulted them before stealing a gold Rolex, a platinum necklace and an engagement ring.

A Cartier watch worth £5.7m and nearly £600 in cash was also allegedly taken, according to Caribbean360.com.

Sandy Lane is situated on the western coast of the island and is often referred to as the 'platinum coast'.

It is home to wealthy expats along with a famous hotel of the same name.

The Sandy Lane resort hosted the wedding of golf star Tiger Woods to Swedish model Elin Nordegren - now his ex-wife after Woods admitted to infidelity - in 2004.
