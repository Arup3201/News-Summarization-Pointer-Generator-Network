An Indiana couple who nursed an injured fawn back to health more than two years ago is now facing jail time after refusing to leave the animal to die.

Connersville police officer Jeff Counceller says that it was a little more than two years ago while on patrol that he discovered the tiny deer curled up on a neighbor’s front porch, badly wounded and unable to stand.

Without time to help it himself, he called his wife, a registered nurse, who cautiously approached the deer with their teenaged daughter before experiencing the fawn gently licking their hands.

Unbeknownst to them at the time, however, was that bringing the animal home with them was illegal according to the state's Department of Natural Resources, with the crime punishable by jail.

Punishing: An Indiana couple are facing criminal charges after they nursed this fawn back to health after finding it badly wounded near their home

Good intentions: Jeff and Jennifer Counceller, pictured, brought the deer home, naming it Little Orphan Dani, in hopes of one day releasing it back into the wild

'I could feel all of the open wounds all along her back side and she wouldn't stand up,' Jennifer Counceller told ABC News of that day back in 2010.

She described the deer as having puncture wounds along its hips from a possible coyote attack. The wounds she said were maggot infested.

If they left the animal there it would surely die, she reasoned.

That was the exact suggestion the DNR offered them when they were contacted.

The DNR told them to take the animal out into the woods and leave it there, allowing nature to take its course

'She would have laid there and starved to death and had a miserable death,' Mrs Connersville told the IndyStar.

Repercussions: The couple are accused of illegally possessing a white-tailed deer, a misdemeanor offense punishable with up to 60 days in jail and a fine up to $500

Instead they took the animal back to their 17-acre farm and began caring for her, starting with a small bottle of goats milk, while giving her the name of Little Orphan Dani.

Today the DNR say what they did two years ago was illegal with it being a misdemeanour offense to possess a 
white-tailed deer. It's a crime that faces the family with a maximum of 60 days in jail and a
 fine up to $500.

The Councellers say the newly pressed charge comes after a six-month investigation by the department which included a half a dozen visits to their home and calls to local authorities.

The family says they didn’t know at the time that it was illegal to keep the deer. When this was informed, the solution offered to them was to euthanize it with the deer said to be posing a safety threat to humans.

‘I was devastated,’ Mrs Counceller told ABC of her reaction. ‘I spent a year and several months nursing her into adulthood, getting to the point where she was able to go out on her own.

Human threat: The Indiana Department of Natural Resources told them, Jeff Counceller pictured, that they have to euthanize the deer with it now being a potential threat to human health

‘No matter what the law is, we did what was right for the animal,’ she said, adding that they planned to release the animal back into the woods once it was fully recovered.

On the day of Dani’s scheduled execution, however, they found the deer gone. The door to her outdoor enclosure was found hanging open.

An incident report filed by the DNR lists Jennifer Counceller’s 80-year-old father as a suspect in the animal’s release, according to the IndyStar, but that’s an allegation Mrs Counceller says they cannot prove.

The family says they didn't have a hand in Dani's escape but admit that they also didn't try too hard to find out how it happened.

Mr Counceller only reasons that Dani had a good number of friends: 'She was very popular.'

Not backing down: Mr Counceller, a police officer, and his wife Jennifer, a nurse, plan to fight the charge against them just because of principal while the deer has since been freed into the wild

Deer or no deer, with the ongoing criminal charge the family says they plan to fight their alleged crime, even though court fees could reach $5,000, ten-times more than the threatened fine.

‘Sometimes, it's not always about the DNR laws,’ Mrs Counceller said. ‘Sometimes it's about common sense and what's right in God's eyes. And that's what I'm going to stand for.’

They also reason jail being an unlikely ending for them if found guilty.

Among national reaction to the Councellers' charges, a Facebook page has since been set up in support of the family – currently seeing more than 9,500 likes – as well as a petition to drop the charges on change.org.

The petition reports a little more than 6,700 signatures as of Tuesday morning but short by roughly 700 claimed needed.

The case could go to court next month for a jury trial.
