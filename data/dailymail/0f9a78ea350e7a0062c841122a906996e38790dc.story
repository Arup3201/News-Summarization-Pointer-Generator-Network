Bill Clinton has been caught on tape making spontaneous comments about Israel's prime minister that seem to be in direct conflict with Hillary Clinton's public stance.

The former president's comments that Bibi Netanyahu was 'not the man' to make peace with Palestine were captured during a talk with a pro-Palestinian activist in Iowa on Sunday.

He and Hillary were both in the state that kicks off the election season with its first in the nation caucus for the Harkin Steak Fry.

'If we don’t force him to have peace, we 
won’t have peace … Netanyahu is not the guy,' the unidentified activist told Clinton, according to the The New York Post.

'I agree with that,' Bill responded.

It seems unlikely he knew the conversation was being recorded by C-Span which was just wrapping up its coverage of the political event.

The cookout was organized by Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who is retiring.

Political junkies view the visit as a primer for Hillary's possible candidacy.

The exchange came after Hillary had walked away.

She has been a hardline Israel supporter and defended Netanyahu in a recent interview with the Atlantic.

She had several reported disagreements with the man while President Barack Obama's secretary of state but seems to have moved beyond their differences.

'I saw Netanyahu move from being against the two-state solution to announcing his support for it,' she told the magazine. 'To considering all kinds of Barack-like options, way far from what he is, and what he is comfortable with.'

The Post reports that both the Clintons declined to comment on the exchange to Israeli paper Haaretz.
