Germany is asking its citizens to boycott holidays in Demark after the neighbouring country reinstated border controls after decades of passport-free travel.

Europe Minister and deputy premier in the state of Hesse, JÃ¶rg-Uwe Hahn, said 'people should vote with their feet' to show their disapproval of the Danish government's policy.

Critics say the move breaches the Schengen Agreement - the EU pact which allowed for free movement of citizens between all 25 countries signed up to it.

Clampdown: The Danish government has said it is reintroducing border controls to tackle drug and weapon smuggling

Denmark has reinstated border controls with Germany and Sweden.

Mr Hahn said: 'I can only advise people to do a U-turn and take a holiday in Austria or Poland.

'This would be a vote with the feet by which you would be able to show the Danish government what you think of their policy.'

The Danish government has said it is bringing back border checks, complete with customs searches, in a bid to clamp down on smuggled drugs and weapons.

It insists that it is legal within the Schengen framework and blasted the reaction in Germany as 'hysteria'.

Peter Christensen, minister for customs and taxation, said: 'The vast majority of travellers won't notice the checks. We welcome German holidaymakers.'

Freedom of movement: Critics have said the move goes against the Schengen Agreement - which created a passport-less travel zone for EU citizens

Denmark said it had been awash with smuggled guns, black money and drugs in recent years and that the measures at the border were aimed at stopping these illegal activities.

The country's TV2 showed live footage of customs officers searching cars as they pass through border controls.

Alexander Alvaro, a German MEP, called the controls 'a backward roll' which 'endangers the cohesion of the EU as a whole'.

Measures: Danish customs director Erling Andersen said travellers from within the EU would not be required to show their passports

Customs controls will gradually be strengthened to include new buildings at crossings, lower speed limits at checkpoints and new equipment for reading licence plates of passing vehicles.

By the end of 2011, a total of 98 additional customs officers will join the country's 182-man force at the borders between Germany and Sweden.

Officers will not be checking passports, which is believed to make it compatible with Schengen rules.

Tax and customs administration director Erling Andersen said: 'The main difference is people will see more customs uniforms, more random controls than they are used to.'

The Schengen Agreement was initially signed in 1985 in five of the ten member states of the European Economic Community and created the border-less Schengen Area.

It now allows passport-less travel throughout the EU, so long as the traveller has a national identity card. Passports are still required where there is no identity card.

But in May, 15 of EU signatories said they would be in favour of reinstating border controls at a meeting in Brussels.

France and Italy have been pushing for a revision of the Schengen agreement since conflicts in North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia, saw tens of thousands of immigrants arriving into the country from the unrest.

EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem said that 'it may also be necessary to foresee the temporary reintroduction of limited internal border controls under very exceptional circumstances'.
