Pope Francis used his weekly public audience today to thank well wishers for their prayers and condolences after two of his great-nephews died in a car crash yesterday.

The great-nephews, one aged two, the other aged just eight months, died along with their mother after their car hit the back of a grain truck in Argentina yesterday.

Francis's nephew Emanuel Bergoglio, who was driving the car, has been taken to hospital where he is in serious condition.

The Pope made his appearance today despite losing two of his great-nephews in a car crash yesterday

Today Francis listened as priests wished him well in several languages before thanking them, saying 'even the Pope has a family.'

DYN news agency said the accident happened shortly after midnight when Mr Begoglio's car slammed into the back of a truck carrying grains. 

The news came after Francis revealed he may only have two or three years left to live in a news conference on his way home from South Korea.

Speaking on a plane after his first trip to Asia, the Pope said he believed he only had limited time left to complete his reforms of the Roman Catholic Church.

Asked about how he copes with his popularity, he said: ‘I try to think of my sins, my mistakes, so as not to think that I am some- body important.’

He then added: ‘Because I know this is going to last a short time, two or three years and then… to the house of the Father.’

The children, aged two and eight months, died along with their mother when the car they were in hit the back of a grain truck. The Pope's nephew, Emanuel Bergoglio, who was driving, is still in hospital

Francis also revealed that he believes he only has two or three more years to live while travelling back from his visit to South Korea (pictured)

According to a Vatican source, the 77-year-old has previously told those close to him that he thought he only had a few years left.

He also revealed that he would consider retiring if he felt he could no longer perform his duties.

His predecessor Pope Benedict XVI resigned in February last year.

‘If you asked me if, in the future, I felt I could not go forward, would I do the same? I would do the same. Benedict has opened a door,’ Francis said on board the papal plane.

The conference marked the end of his trip to South Korea, which he had been touring since Thursday.

He also admitted that his advisers have been encouraging him to rest more after he cancelled a series of engagements earlier in the year.
