The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, has released an additional 400 pages of once-secret security documents in response to changes laid out by President Obama on Friday relating to the nation's polarizing surveillance practices.

The declassification of the spy documents is part of a move by Obama to make public as much information as possible concerning the controversial bulk telephone-data-collection program that has angered many Americans over the six months.

The documents were posted on the DNI's website.

Going public: James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, has declassified a raft of documents, at the request of President Obama, relating to the nation's controversial cell phone surveillance program

Furor: Protests erupted after the extent of the US cellphone surveillance program were exposed by Edward Snowden last year

Obama issued the order in response to an international firestorm over the sweeping nature of the nation's spying that kicked up last summer when former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden began disclosing details of the surveillance programs, according to Fox News.

In his speech Friday, Obama said the NSA will need approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court each time it searches the trove of phone data.

Under the current system, cleared NSA analysts have had ready access to the phone records in an online archive since 2006 when the court first approved the FBI's request to begin the bulk phone records collection.

One of the newly-released documents, dated Aug. 18, 2006, details how the FISC court approved a request from then-FBI Director Robert Mueller for 'all call-detail records' or 'telephony meta data'.

In the document approving the metadata collection program, the court said the data requested includes 'comprehensive routing information, including but not limited to session identifying information (e.g., originating and terminating telephone number, communications device identifier, etc.), trunk identifier, telephone calling card numbers and time and duration of call'.

It also specifies that the data will not include 'substantive content of any communication' or the name, address or financial information of a subscriber or customer.

In brief, phone numbers and call durations are stored, but the conversation and communication itself is not.

The latest declassification and release of intelligence agency records brings the total of documents made public to 2,300 pages, including orders and opinions of the FISC and pleadings before it, documents the intelligence community provided to Congress, training slides and other internal memos describing the legal basis for the programs and how they operate.

Obama has been under pressure since Snowden took an estimated 1.7 million documents from the NSA and gave them to journalists around the world.

The U.S. public, Congress and allies overseas were shocked to learn the extent of the NSAâ€™s post-9/11 surveillance.

Soon after Snowdenâ€™s disclosure in June, Obama promised to review the system that has changed rapidly as technology improved.

On Friday, Obama defended the work of the U.S. spying apparatus as necessary to protect Americans and international allies.

He left the programs mostly intact, but added restrictions
