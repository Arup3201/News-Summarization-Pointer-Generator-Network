A British scientist has spotted a strange object that he has named ‘Peggy’ in one of Saturn’s rings.

Astronomers are baffled by what the ring might be, but one theory suggests it could be the beginnings of a new moon.

In a talk at American Geophysical Union this week, Professor Carl Murray of Queen Mary University of London said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft.

The thin, outermost ring shown in this picture from the Cassini probe is Saturn's F ring, and the bright dot near it is the moon Prometheus. The thicker white band is the A ring. The smudge near what looks like the tip of that ring was created by Peggy

The mysterious object, which was located at the right edge of Saturn’s A ring, has been named ‘Peggy’ after Professor Murray’s mother-in-law, according to a report by Adam Mann in Wired.

Peggy is thought to be about a 0.6 miles (1km) in diameter, which experts claim is too small for it to be a moon.

It could, however, be the build-up of ring material that has collapsed gravitationally under its own weight.

Saturn is known to have of 53 natural with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings

Launched in 1997, Cassini has been exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004.

On Saturn, a full year is the equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning Cassini has only been able to observe a third of a Saturn year.

Since 2004, Saturn and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer.

Cassini has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving there in 2004, also observing Jupiter, the heliosphere, and testing the theory of relativity

Cassini is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter orbit, and its mission is on going as of 2013.

Some of Saturn’s moons, particularly those orbiting near the rings, are thought to have formed in this way, creating a ring of dust then collecting more material to grow.

The planet is known to have of 53 natural with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings.

Some moons, such as Prometheus and Pandora, interact with ring material, shepherding the ring in its orbit.

After his initial discovery, Professor Murray took a look 107 Cassini images taken since 2012 and claims it's possible to see a smudge made by the object in many of them.

The Cassini team is particularly interested to see what happens to Peggy next month, when gravitational interactions will cause the A ring to expand.

Last year, hundreds of objects up to half a mile in diameter were caught on camera wreaking havoc with one of Saturn’s rings.

The objects were actually snowballs created by some of Saturn’s 60 moons, like Prometheus.

They were snapped punching through Saturn’s F ring, the outermost of the planet's main rings, with a radius of about 87,000 miles.

At the time of the discovery, Professor Murray said, ‘I think the F ring is Saturn's weirdest ring, and these latest Cassini results go to show how the F ring is even more dynamic than we ever thought.’

If this is the case, it is being formed due to the build-up of ring material that has collapsed under its own weight
