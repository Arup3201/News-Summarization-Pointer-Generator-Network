There has never been a better time to book a holiday due to the strength of the pound, a new study claims today.

The cost of a holiday abroad has plummeted over the last two years as the sterling increases in value against dozens of foreign currencies.

Research from travel money business, Centtrip, said Britons now got ‘more bang for their buck’ than in 2013 after the value of foreign currencies fells against the pound.

British holidaymakers now have significantly more spending power in at least 14 major currencies 

The study found holidaymakers have significantly more spending power in at least 14 major currencies, including the US dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.

The sterling is also at its highest level against the euro for more than seven years, giving a boost to British families planning holidays on the Continent.

It means a family changing £100 through currency exchange will now get 21 euros more than two year ago.

Tourists travelling to Russia will get twice as much rouble for £100 as they did in 2013, receiving almost 9,600 today instead of 4,600.

Meanwhile, those travelling to Norway will receive a third more krona for £100 in sterling, rising from around 900 to 1,200.

Those travelling to the US will receive just four dollars more for their £100, after the pound grew by just 2 per cent against the dollar since 2013.

Brian Jamieson, of Centtrip, said: ‘We are seeing unprecedented levels of strength in sterling and, as it continues to grow, the power of our spending money whilst holidaying abroad increases.

‘Many of our customers are locking in current attractive rates and buying Euros to use today or at a later date.

‘There has not been a better time for Brits to travel abroad.’

Centtrip was launched in January and offers a single prepaid MasterCard that can be used to pay in 14 currencies at the actual live currency rates, rather than incurring a bank’s conversion charges.

Millions of British holidaymakers are expected to take advantage of the strong pound this Easter by booking cheaper breaks in Europe and farther afield.

Research by the Daily Mail found that, if the euro continues to fall against the pound, a family of four could save almost £250 on a seven-night city break in Paris this July compared with July last year.
