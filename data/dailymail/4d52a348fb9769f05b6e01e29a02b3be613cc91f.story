Fresh attempts are to be made to find the 'missing' gold of the last Tsar of Russia, believed to in Siberia

Fresh attempts are to be made to find the 'missing' gold of the last Tsar of Russia - worth 'up to £50 billion' at today's prices - which is believed to be stashed or lost in Siberia. 

Some 95 years after Nicholas the Second and his family were shot by a firing squad loyal to Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, six sites have been identified where the royal treasure may be located. 

Two of them are in the world's deepest lake and another is in a region notorious for its gulag prison camps during the Stalin era. 

Gold from the Russian Imperial state was moved eastward during the First World War and initially held in Kazan on the Volga River. 

'One of Britain's most legendary spies, Sidney Reilly, and the colourful, womanising diplomat, Robert Bruce Lockhart, who with his lover Baroness Moura Budberg, Russia's 'Mata Hari', was accused of plotting to assassinate Lenin, were directly involved in this operation to prevent the gold falling into Communist hands,' said the Siberian Times.

The bed-hopping baroness - who also slept with writers HG Wells and Maxim Gorky - was the great great aunt of deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. 

After the Reds seized power in the capital, Petrograd, now St Petersburg, the anti-Communists moved it by train into Siberia.

Here it was under the control of Admiral Alexander Kolchak, who led the White Russian forces loyal to the royal family during the civil war which engulfed the country from 1918-20.

Certainly some of the treasure was used to buy arms to use against Lenin's forces, but historians are divided over how much was later grabbed by the Communists. Doubts also remain on the quantity of Tsarist gold sneaked abroad or hidden or lost in Siberia

Diplomat Robert Bruce Lockhart was also said to be involved in the plan to protect the gold

'Groups of intrepid searchers have not given up hope of finding this treasure, convinced that it never fell into the hands of the Soviet authorities, and hoping this will be the lucky year for the royal gold rush,' said The Siberian Times.

This year marks the 400th anniversary of the fallen House of Romanov. 

'I am convinced that at least some of the tsar's gold remains in Siberia and I continue to hunt for it,' said a researcher working at two of the suspected sites where the Romanov bullion is hidden.  

'I will not divulge the locations I am searching but modern technology makes it more likely than ever before to be able to find the gold stashed beneath the surface.'

A Mir-2 mini-submarine in 2010 located allegedly 'shiny metal objects' some 1,300 feet below the surface of Lake Baikal in an area close to where a train carrying gold was rumoured to have crashed are the time of Kolchak's arrest and execution by the Soviet authorities in 1920.  

More dives are expected for bullion at this site, but another theory is that White troops carrying gold tried crossing ice bound Baikal - the world's deepest lake - in winter but perished on  as temperatures slumped to minus 60C.

When the ice melted in spring, the gold sank to the bottom of the lake.

Other theories link stashes of the the 1,600 tons of gold to two sites in Omsk, where Kolchak had his headquarters. One is in labyrinthine passages under the city, another close to a nearby village, Zakhlamino.

A further possible site is in the former gulag region of Krasnoyarsk, where a mysterious graveyard of some 500 White soldiers is alleged to have been found. Local folklore suggests the forces stashed the gold shortly before they were slaughtered. 

Meanwhile author Valery Kurnosov believes MI6 has information on a separate collection of gold and treasures from a tsarist-era bank close to Kazan.

A British secret agent called Roger Gariel was involved in a joint operation in 1928 involving the Soviet government and Western figures to find the gold in a forest near the city. The operation failed and the Soviet government later continued the hunt but never found it, he said. 

Historian Oleg Budnitskii, of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has disputed the value of the 'Kolchak Gold' inherited from Imperial Russia, saying it was worth £3 billion maximum. He also claims none remains hidden, arguing it was all accounted for.
