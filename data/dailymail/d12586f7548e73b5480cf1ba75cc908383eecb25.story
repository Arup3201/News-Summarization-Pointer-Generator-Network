Serving soldiers fought back tears today as they unveiled a memorial to Britain's last First World War survivor Harry Patch.

The troops removed a Union Jack from the £10,000 stone monument as dozens of friends and relatives gathered in Wells, Somerset.

Mr Patch - Britain's last fighting Tommy - died in 2009 aged 111 having fought in the battle of Passchendaele in 1917.

The moving ceremony yards from Wells Cathedral finished with a rendition of The Band and Bugles of the 6th Rifles, the successors to Mr Patch’s regiment.

Alan Williams from Shepton Mallet, a friend of Mr Patch's, launched the bid for the memorial made from Doulting Stone earlier this year.

'Being Doulting Stone - the west facade of the cathedral is Doulting Stone so it works well together,' Mr Williams told the BBC ahead of the ceremony.

'It'll be recessed with a beautiful piece of Welsh slate, with some carefully chosen words - 217 letters in total.

'The letters cover Harry Patch as the spokesman for the lost generation, which is also very important.'

Mr Patch, who served with the 7th Duke of Cornwall’s Light Infantry, lost his three best friends at Passchendaele and did not talk about the war to anyone for 80 years.

But as the numbers of veterans dwindled he became sought after by historians and the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal used him as a figurehead for the war.

Mr Patch's memoirs - The Last Fighting Tommy - became  an instant hit for their revealing account of the Great War.

His funeral at Wells Cathedral in 2009 was attended by Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall and other prominent politicians.

He was the last living veteran of any nationality who served in the trenches and was also for a brief time Europe's oldest man before his death.

Thousands lined the streets of his home town,in pouring rain rain to pay their respects to the soldier who came to be a reminder of unimaginable carnage.

Bells rang from the cathedral at 11am - chiming 111 times, one for every single year of Mr Patch's life. Shortly afterwards, the funeral cortege left Fletcher House, the care home where he spent his last 13 years.

Camilla had arrived shortly before the service began, wearing a hat and clutching an umbrella and joined Veterans Minister Kevan Jones and army chief General Sir Richard Dannatt.

An array of soldiers from the nations who fought in the Great War marched together as the hearse was led by two mounted policeman on the veteran's final, sombre journey.

Close friend Jim Ross, who gave the eulogy, said: 'Harry knew that by speaking out, the memories would come back, the demons I call them, would come back to torment and torture him.'

He told the congregation: 'I believe 
they did, but I believe Harry made the decision because he wanted to get
his message broadcast. His prime message is that we should settle 
disputes by negotiation and compromise, not by war.'

He
added: 'We are the ordinary ones. Harry was the extraordinary man. The 
plumber from Coombe Down who showed us true heroism. Now at long, long 
last Harry, you can rest in peace.'

Born
in 1898, Mr Patch was the son of a master builder from a village near 
Bath. He became an apprentice plumber but in 1916 was conscripted into 
the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry at the age of 18.

Conflict: Soldiers carry a fallen troop at the battle of Passchendaele in 1917. Mr Patch was at the bloody battle and saw three of his best friends die

He was an assistant gunner in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and within six months, he was on the front line.

Mr Patch fought in the battle of Passchendaele in 1917 where more than 70,000 died. 'If any man tells you he went over the top and he wasn't scared, he's a damn liar,' he once said.

As a machine-gunner, it was Mr Patch's terrifying job to carry and assemble the spare parts of the gun and make sure it worked.

A shrapnel wound in 1917 ended his war and he was so traumatised that he would refuse to talk about his experiences until the final years of his life.

Finally, in the late 90s, when he had already turned 100, he opened up and from then on did his best to keep the memory of his former comrades alive.

He told a documentary in 2003: 'Any one of them could have been me. Millions of men came to fight in this war and I find it incredible that I am the only one left.'

He returned to plumbing after the war and married three times. With his first wife, he had two sons, Dennis and Roy, who he outlived.

By World War II, he was too old to serve and instead became a maintenance manager at a U.S. army camp and joined the Auxiliary Fire Service, tackling fires started by German bombs.

He moved into a home in 1996, aged 98. It was not until he was 105 that he went back to Ypres. He then returned a year later to meet a German veteran.

When he died, he had been planning another trip back to Flanders for later this year such was his determination for people never to forget the sacrifices made.

An unlikely tribute from rock bank Radiohead has already been paid - the group has written a song in Mr Patch's honour using his own words.

Singer Thom Yorke was moved to write it by an interview the veteran gave in 2005, when he declared: 'Irrespective of the uniforms we wore, we were all victims.'

The composition's haunting words declare: 'I am the only one that got through, the others died where ever they fell' and 'I've seen hell upon this earth'.
