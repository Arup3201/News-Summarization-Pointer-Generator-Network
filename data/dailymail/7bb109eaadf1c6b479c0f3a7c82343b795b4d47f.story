A Miami mother is accused of beating her 8-year-old son with a rope and killing the family’s English bulldog puppy by repeatedly slamming him on the floor in front of her children.

Charlotte Wonjah, 26, remained in jail Friday after a New Year's Day court appearance on child abuse and cruelty to animals charges.

Police say she admitted to ‘anger issues’ and said she ‘did not want to clean after the dog’ after the puppy went to the bathroom on the floor.

Arrested: Charlotte Wonjah, 26, pictured left in her booking photo and right with her infant daughter, has been charged with child abuse and cruelty to animal 

Confession: Wonjah, a Miami performer, admitted to ‘anger issues’ and said she killed the family dog in front of her children because she did not want to clean up after him 

Domestic call: Police responded to the family's home in Miami after getting a call from Wonjah's boyfriend of seven years about a domestic altercation 

Vicious attack: Wonjah reportedly became upset that the family's 1-month-old pet English bulldog went to the bathroom in the corner and slammed him to the floor 

The mother, a club performer from Miami, is accused of beating her 8-year-old son, whose body had bruises and welts in different stages of healing.

Wonjah was booked into jail Tuesday after police say she attacked her boyfriend of seven years, Juan Suarez, when he returned home with gifts for their children from his mother. She faces two counts of misdemeanor battery for that episode.

Speaking to CBS Miami, Juan Suarez said that he called police Tuesday when his girlfriend attacked his 14-year-old daughter from a previous marriage.

Suarez said Wonjah 'went ballistic' and started hitting, punching and biting him for no apparent reason. When his daughter tried to intervene, Wonjah allegedly turned on the teen, hitting her in the face and throwing her against a wall.

When officers responded to the family's home at 360 Northwest 58th Avenue, they discovered that Wonjah and Suarez's 8-year-old son had been physically abused as well.

Mother-to-be: The 26-year-old is four months pregnant with her third child, a boy 

Jailbird: Wonjah has a criminal record that includes two arrests on battery charges in 2013 

The woman's boyfriend said the boy told him that Wonjah repeatedly struck him with a hangar and a rope in the bathroom.

Officers investigating the domestic incident also learned that Wonjah had killed the family's 1-month-old English bulldog puppy by repeatedly slamming the helpless animal against the ground.

Suarez said when the puppy got up and tried to walk, the enraged woman slammed his head against the floor until he stopped moving.

‘She has some serious issues to get rid of,’ said Suarez. ‘She needs some help and some counseling and to stay away from kids until she get better or she is going to hurt them.’

Suarez revealed that the 26-year-old is four months pregnant with their second child together, a son.

Wonjah, a native of Liberia, had two prior arrests for battery charges dating from April 2013 and August 2013.

On his way out: Wonjah's boyfriend made it clear that he plans to leave the woman and raise the children on his own 

Juan Suarez said Wonjah attacked him in August 2013 and has just completed probation this past summer.

Wonjah is a Miami musician and certified nursing assistant. Her Facebook page is filled with racy photos from her past performances in clubs and professional modeling shots depicting the 26-year-old posing provocatively in skimpy outfits.

The boyfriend said he had stayed with Wonjah all these years for the sake of their children, but now he wants to raise them on his own.

NBC Miami reported Wonjah is being held on $50,000 bail.
