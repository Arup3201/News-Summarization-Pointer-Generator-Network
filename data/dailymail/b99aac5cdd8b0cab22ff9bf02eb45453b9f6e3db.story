Nice have called on FIFA to use 'sporting logic' and allow Hatem Ben Arfa to play for the club this season.

The former Newcastle United forward – released from his contract earlier this month – was prevented from making his debut for the Ligue 1 side after it emerged he has already played for two clubs this season.

Nice, however, argue that Ben Arfa's appearance for Newcastle was only in an Under-21s match and the English FA have supported their claims by stating that the game was not recognised as an official fixture.

Ben Arfa was released from his contract at Newcastle earlier this month after falling out with coaching staff 

The French forward signed for Ligue 1 side Nice soon after, but has had his debut delayed by FIFA rulings

Ben Arfa also played for Hull City this season, but failed to make an impact and had his loan deal terminated

Ben Arfa also turned out for Hull City during an unsuccessful loan period and FIFA rules state that a player can only represent two clubs during one season.

But Nice have released a statement, saying: 'The return to this country of the French international has not yet been sorted out from an administrative point of view due to the fact brought to light by our own federation with FIFA, despite an initial positive and unequivocal response from the English federation.

'OGC Nice wishes to quickly resolve this issue and that the sporting logic prevails so that we can bring our new recruit into the squad for this Friday's trip to Bordeaux.

'In a period where the general feeling is one of disappointment at seeing a talent-drain, the club hopes to be able to count on the support of the national bodies to facilitate the return of an international to France.'

Having been one of French football's brightest prospects, Ben Arfa cut a forlorn figure on the Hull bench 

Ben Arfa has 13 caps for France, but has not played for Les Blues since the European Championships in 2012
