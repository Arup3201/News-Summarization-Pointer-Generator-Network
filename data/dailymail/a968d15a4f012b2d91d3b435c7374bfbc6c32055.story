Willy Twiston-Davies believes the fifth-placed finish of First Class Mail on his second career start at Brighton should not be taken too negatively.

The Daily Mail and Mail Online are experiencing the ownership experience this summer with the chestnut colt trained by Mick Channon.

Hopes were high that our horse could step up on a promising debut sixth at Windsor but, ill at ease on Brighton’s undulations, First Class Mail could never reach a threatening position before running on when meeting the rising ground in the final furlong.

The six-furlong Bibby Financial Services Median Auction Maiden Stakes was won by well-backed 2-1 favourite Jargon, ridden by George Baker and trained in Newmarket by Michael Bell.

First Class Mail, who broke from the stalls slowly, was beaten by five lengths.

Twiston-Davies said: ‘He didn’t like the ground, which has become very fast, or the track and he was taken off his feet in the early stages.

‘There are more positives than negatives to that run and, maybe, we should look to trying seven furlongs. I am not disappointed.’

First Class Mail, a son of sire Winker Watson who was calmer in the preliminaries than he had been at Windsor, was at the back of the field for much of the six-furlong race but did run through the line with some purpose, as it ended the race strongly.

He is not be the first inexperienced horse to find the course at Brighton tricky to handle but should hopefully learn from the experience.

Providing First Class Mail  emerges from the run in good shape, a third outing should not be too far away.

After a third run, he will then become eligible to run contest nurseries - handicap races for two-year-olds.
