This long haired feline could well be the most pampered pet in the whole of the UK, living a life many humans can only dream of.

Dumpty Roo’s owner is so ‘privileged’ to be in her presence she has dedicated her life to being her servant.

From designer wardrobes to £20 a bag food, the Himalayan Lynx is spoiled rotten by devoted owner Carol Lake, who gives her round-the-clock attention to keep her happy.

Dumpty Roo will only eat from Royal Doulton and Wedgewood bowls and dishes and eats all her meals off a tray on her owner¿s bed

The Himalayan Lynx is spoiled rotten by devoted owner Carol Lake, who continues to wear to the same  - very expensive- perfume every day to please Dumpty

Carol, 52, from Stafford has no children and lavishes the mollycoddled moggy with expensive bed sheets, 
crystal feeding bowls and claims she can only drink bottled water.

She even carries her everywhere because her paws are ‘too delicate’ to walk on anything other than the finest wool.

Carol
 refuses to go on holiday with husband John without the tabby’s 
permission, and even has to sneak home if she is drunk because the cat 
is anti-alcohol.

Carol said:
 'Dumpty Roo isn’t like a normal cat. She’s very demanding and will only
 accept the absolute best. Life is very much lived at the pace little 
Dumpty wants and dictates, and we tailor our lives around her wants and 
needs.

'To say that she is a
 diva is an understatement. She is very exacting in what she will and 
will not do and has trained me to service her every whim and fancy.

Carol buys designer clothes for Dumpty and insists on carrying her on any surface that isn't the 'finest wool' to protect her paws 

'She’s
 a real diva. I’m more like a 24-hour maid than her owner. But I don’t 
mind, I’m just honoured that she chose me to run around after her.

'She’ll
 only eat top of the range dry cat food. The more expensive the better. 
They say cats can’t read, but I’m sure she rummages through my receipts 
to decide which offering to turn her nose up at based on price.'

As a customer services worker, Carol’s wage doesn’t quite stretch to cover 13-year-old Dumpty Roo’s lavish lifestyle.

So
 she is forced to spend hours trawling car boot sales and budget 
websites to find cut-price gifts that will measure up to her pet’s 
exacting standards.

Dumpty 
Roo will only eat from Royal Doulton and Wedgewood bowls and dishes, and
 boasts a collection worth thousands thanks to Carol’s bargain hunting.

Carol says she is 'privileged' to be in Dumpty's presence and is 'just honoured that she chose me to run around after her'

She
 eats all her meals off a tray on her owner’s bed and drinks only 
bottled water out of an antique crystal bowl on the fireplace.

Carol
 said: 'She also has two large ‘sculptures’ with cats and mice which 
have a bowl incorporated in so she doesn’t have to lower her royal chops
 down to the floor to eat.'

But despite the spoilt tabby’s demands, Carol insists she is worth every effort - and is ‘honoured’ to be around her.

While
 Carol’s other rescue cat Willi Whizkas often chooses to spend nights 
out in the garden, Dumpty Roo will only sleep on her owner’s bed.

Carol said she is lucky to be given a corner of the bed at night and is often woken by her feline bedfellow.

She
 said: 'When she arrived I had to buy all new bed sheets. She likes Lulu
 Guinness designer duvet covers so we have two: one to wash and one on 
the bed.

'She’s doesn’t usually like going outside but sometimes she’ll come out with me on a lead and sit in the sunshine.

'Then
 she needs to be picked up and bought inside as she doesn’t do grass or 
walking on tarmac. Her paws are intended to walk only on the finest wool
 carpets.

Dumpty loves being groomed in a steam filled fragrant bathroom, and particularly likes Molton Brown Paradisiac Pink Peppercorn or Rose Granati

'Despite a collection of toys such as stuffed frogs and mice, Madam will only play with Napier catnip mice at £4 pop.'

Carol lives at the home she has dubbed ‘Tom Cat Towers’ with her husband John.

But she very clear about who comes first in their household.

Carol
 said: 'Life is very much lived at the pace little Dumpty wants and 
dictates, and we tailor our lives around her wants and needs.

'Her current favourite dry food costs £20 a bag.'

Carol says life is lived at the pace Dumpty dictates

Carol has a regular radio show on Stafford Radio and she says Dumpty Roo is her biggest critic.

Carol
 said: 'I’ve got a Stafford Radio sweatshirt, which I made into a 
cushion for her to recline on while she listens to the radio.

'I
 always have to wear the same perfume as Madam has poor eyesight. She 
will then know it is me in the room, or approaching her. I wore Birmane 
when I rehomed her, and thus now have to wear it always when in her 
presence.

'It is 
horrifically expensive - around £130 a bottle brand new- and was 
discontinued so I have to trawl eBay to ensure Madam is kept 
comfortable.

'She is also 
very particular about the bath products I use. She likes Molton Brown 
Paradisiac Pink Peppercorn or Rose Granati. She loves being groomed in a
 steam filled fragrant bathroom.

'She
 sometimes gets rather miffed when I go out, especially if she can tell 
I’ve been drinking. It’s like she’s saying ‘how dare you go out and 
drink?’

'It’s almost like a marriage.'

Dumpty’s
 affection has earned her an international following as Carol posts her 
daily activities in a series of online diaries - they are so popular 
Dumpty has started receiving fan mail.

Carol
 said: 'Adoring fans send items which she models and send a photo back 
with a letter of thanks. She always replies to fan mail, but as her maid
 this job falls to me.

'She is a very large feline lady and the clothing items can be quite tight, so they can get handed down to cat charities.'

Although she has no children of her own, Carol insists that Dumpty Roo is not a baby substitute.

She said: 'No way will she allow you to ‘baby’ her. She is just a snooty old baggy puss who is so hard not to adore.'
