Not even torrential rain could deter Chelsea supporters from turning out in force to meet John Terry on Thursday afternoon.

Fans queued through a downpour to come face-to-face with Terry, who was signing autographs in Kingston, London.

The 33-year-old defender later thanked his followers on Instagram, before some of his Blues team-mates turned out for England in their 5-0 victory over San Marino.
