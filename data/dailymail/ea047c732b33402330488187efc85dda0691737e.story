Former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee's wife says her husband is receiving hospice care after his health has declined over the past two months.

Bradlee's wife, Sally Quinn, said in a television interview broadcast Sunday that the 93-year-old  has suffered from Alzheimer's disease for several years and that his health has recently deteriorated.

The Washington Post reports that Quinn says Bradlee sleeps 20 hours a day and doesn't eat much. 

Quinn, who is a journalist and met Bradlee at the newspaper, says her husband began hospice care at the couple's home in Washington in mid-September.

She said her husband of over four decades still sleeps at home in their bed next to her and still knows who she is.

'We spent a lot of time together and we hold hands and he knows me and he loves having me there and it is just extremely rewarding to be able to be there for him now,' she said.

In the C Span interview Quinn, 73, says it became obvious Bradlee had the condition about two years ago.

Bradlee was the editor of The Post from 1968 and 1991, during the newspaper's coverage of the Pentagon Papers and the Watergate scandal, which helped lead to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. 

Bradlee is currently vice president at large of The Post and until recent months he used to go back to the newspaper and have lunch with his former colleagues.

In 2013 Bradlee was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Obama. Obama joked that in addition to Bradlee’s military service and important work in the media, he was also jealous of how the ex-editor is able to pull off fashion-forward shirts with white collars

Quinn says she did not tell Bradlee about actress Lauren Bacall's death in August straight away due to his condition.

On 12 August, when Bacall died, Quinn tweeted: 'So so sad about the death of Betty Bacall. 

'I almost lost Ben to her, the only acceptable person. As he would say,she was a spectacular dame.'

She then wrote a piece in the Washington Post which she posted on Twitter which was headlined 'How would you like to compete, as I did, with Lauren Bacall for a man?'

The article details how Bradlee and Bacall first met at a fireworks party in Amagansett and the pair disappeared for an hour

'Ben and I had only recently gotten together, and now I was about to lose him to the sexiest movie star alive. It was at least an hour before they emerged from the dunes, laughing and talking as though they had no concept of time. 

'Ben looked so pleased with himself I could have belted him. He was a bit sheepish when he joined me, and I looked hawkishly for signs of dishevelment, lipstick on the collar. I found nothing, but still. 

'It was no consolation when Betty came over to me as we were leaving and confided in me that Ben was the only man who had ever reminded her of Bogey. (Bogey, of course, being her first husband, Humphrey Bogart.)'

Co-incidentally Bacall’s second husband, actor Jason Robards, played Bradlee in the 1976 Watergate movie All The President’s Men.

Bradlee and Quinn met when Quinn applied to be a secretary to the editor of the editorial page at the Washington Post.

But Bradlee said years later in an interview that he said to the editor: 'I told him that he would get in trouble if he hired her and later on I hired her. 

'I hired Sally to write for the style section.

'She called me Mr. Bradlee the day she left to go to CBS. 

'We hooked up that year, 1973.'

The couple have one son together, Quinn Bradlee, who has Velo-Cardio-Facial Syndrome (VCFS), a  disorder that is expressed through a wide range of physical ailments and learning disabilities.

In 2013 Bradlee was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Obama. 

Obama joked that in addition to Bradlee’s military service and important work in the media, he was also jealous of how the editor is able to pull off fashion-forward shirts with white collars.

‘He always looks so cool in them,’ Obama said.
