This is the moment a self-proclaimed  drinks 'connoisseur' gets fooled by a fake and very unhealthy juice brand 'Juce', master-minded by TV host Jimmy Kimmel.

Alex from New Zealand willingly does a taste test on screen at a farmer's market in Los Angeles. He samples 'Cure', a supposed new high-end citrus refreshment retailing for $19 per bottle.

Little does he know it's actually a mix of water and 20oz of Tang powered orange consisting of more than 2,000 calories and 520gms of sugar - more than 20 times the recommended daily limit.

Blind to what he's actually drinking, Alex puts his refined palate to the test and decides the sugary blend is 'really good'. 

'That's definitely citrus. It's not so sweet. It's just like... you've squeezed it out of the fruits,' he says.

He adds that the concoction is 'very light' and perfect for the summer.

But he's not the only one apparently caught out by Kimmel's fake juice prank.

Another man says Cure  is much 'fresher' and 'more delicious' than a beverage made form concentrate while a woman states that it's definitely worth the $19 price tag.

Kimmel's producers then whipped up three other equally unhealthy 'Juce' recipes dressed up as 'miracle cures'.

Prank: Alex from New Zealand sampled  'Cure', a supposed new high-end citrus refreshment retailing for $19 per bottle, on screen - he described it as 'natural' not realizing the actual ingredients listed here 

Gut-busting: Kimmel's 2,105 calorie Cure drink contains 20oz of Tang orange juice mix and 4 cups of water

Soul was crafted with five packets of Nestle Fun Dip and water, coming in at 250 calories and 65gms of sugar.

One man who tasted it described it as having a 'light' and 'cleansing' feel.

And a young woman said she felt like she'd just consumed something 'very good' for her.

Next up Detox - containing 12 melted Creamsicles and 1,200 calories - was put to the test.

The slushy mixture certainly got one man fired up for the day and he said he felt like 'going for a jog' after taking a sip. 

Another woman said she tasted 'pure' and 'natural fruits' as the creamy artificially-flavored cocktail trickled down her throat.

Lastly, Rainbow was put to the test. 

Made from three cups of water and a 1lb bag of Skittles, this was anything but natural.

But tasters appeared to love the 680 calorie drink, citing it as their favorite yet.

'You don't feel like you're coated with sugar?' the interviewer probes one woman.

'No. It doesn't taste too sweet at all,' the sampler confidently replies.

Shockingly, one man says he can even taste kale in the drink.

Caught on camera: Many viewers who watched the taste testers in action on Jimmy Kimmel Live described it as 'embarrassing' - Some have also accused the social experiment as being staged

Easily fooled: Kimmel coined the prank 'the emperor's new juice'

Rave reviews: But tasters appeared to love the 680 calorie drink, citing it as their favorite of them all

'This was a ten in my eyes,' he chimes. 

However, his smile soon turns to a look of shock as he's told what's actually in the drink - crushed up Skittles in water, poured into a designer bottle.

'Is it? Is it really?' he says gobsmacked before joking: 'It tastes healthy so I'm going to start drinking Skittles now.'
