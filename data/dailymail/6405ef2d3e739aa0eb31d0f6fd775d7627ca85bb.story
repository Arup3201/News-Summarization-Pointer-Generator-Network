Conservative darling Sarah Palin said Thursday that President Barack Obama needs to wake up and realize that the United States and the 'genocidal thugs' affiliated with ISIS can never coexist.

Referencing Obama's remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast the first week in February, during which he said Christians need to get off their 'high horse' when it comes to critiquing Islam, Palin told a group of conservatives that lectures like the president's 'won't stop the Islamists from killing the Christians.'

'While Christians bow our head to pray for you, radical Islamists want to cut off your head,' she said of the president.

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin told attendees of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Thursday that lectures on religion like the one the president made at the National Prayer Breakfast 'won't stop the Islamists from killing the Christians'

Palin dedicated most of her speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, held a few miles outside of Washington, D.C., at a hotel in Maryland, to praising veterans and their service to the country. 'Aside from God almighty,' she said, the only force that can keep 'barbaric' terrorists at bay and 'the only thing standing between us and savages is the red white and blue. It's the United States military'

Palin dedicated most of her speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, held a few miles outside of Washington, D.C., at a hotel in Maryland, to praising veterans and their service to the country. 

'Aside from God almighty,' she said, the only force that can keep 'barbaric' terrorists at bay and 'the only thing standing between us and savages is the red white and blue. It's the United States military.'

Admonishing the Obama administration, Clinton said the U.S. is in a 'long-term, civilization struggle against the forces of evil.' And 'if we intend to beat them, we better get serious about victory,' she said.

'In the past our leaders confronted evil with moral clarity, eliminating Facists and the Nazis' as well as Communists, she said. 'Make no mistake radical Islam is just as dangerous as those ideologies.'

Palin mocked Obama for continuing to 'lead from behind' even after Islamic extremists threatened to cut off his head in the White House.

'He thinks the Islamic state isn't really Islamic,' she said, incredulously.

Obama has acknowledged that terrorists who are a part of ISIS and al Qaeda are Islamic, but he and his administration have steadfastly argued that referring to them in that context merely justifies their hateful ideology.

'Pretending its not there doesn't make it go away,' though, Palin told conservatives on Thursday. 'Calling it something else wont make it so.' 

The world that they want is a world that will submit. We will never submit to evil,' she said to cheers from the audience.

Palin said Obama's State Department is 'naive' to say that the U.S. can't kill its way out of war, as spokesperson Marie Harf, last week claimed. 

'Really? Tell that to the Nazis,' she said. 'Oh wait, You can't because they're dead, we killed them.'
