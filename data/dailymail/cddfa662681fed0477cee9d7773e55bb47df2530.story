A 7-year-old Oregon girl saved her choking mother’s life on Friday when she quickly gave her the Heimlich, thanks to knowledge she gained from the film Mrs. Doubtfire.

Thanks to Amira Thronton of Gresham, her mother will be just fine after choking on some sausage to the point where she couldn’t even speak.

Amira’s mom Jennifer said she panicked, but thankfully her little girl kept her cool.

Hero: 7-year-old Gresham, Oregon girl Amira Thornton saved her mom's life with a skill she learned from the 1993 comedic film Mrs. Doubtfire

Slapstick: In the memorable scene from Mrs. Doubtfire, Robin Williams gives the Heimlich maneuver to Pierce Brosnan, causing them both to topple over in a restaurant

Amira was watching television when she heard strange noises coming from where her mother was in the kitchen.

After seeing that her mom was choking, Amira recalled a scene from the 1993 comedy where Robin Williams administers the Heimlich to a choking Pierce Brosnan.

‘I picked her up three times,’ Amira told KABC. ‘She spit the sausage out.’

Using the Heimlich, or thrusts to the abdomen to dislodge food that is blocking the airways, Amira managed to save her mother.

Dire: In real life, things weren't nearly as funny when Amira heard noises from the kitchen where her mother was and found her choking on sausage

A miraculous feat since young Amira is dwarfed by her mom, who isn’t sure she would have lived without her daughter’s fast action.

‘It was pretty scary because there was nobody else here, and I couldn't talk, I couldn't, I was just in shock,’ Jennifer said.

Amira said that, in addition to Mrs. Doubtfire, her grandfather had showed her how to administer the lifesaving maneuver.
