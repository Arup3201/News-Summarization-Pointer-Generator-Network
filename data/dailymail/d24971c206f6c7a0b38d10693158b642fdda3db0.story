Television personality Shaw Taylor, best known for hosting pioneering crime-solving programme Police 5, has died.

The 90-year-old made a name for himself presenting the ITV show for 30 years, urging viewers to stay on the lookout for crime with his catchphrase 'keep 'em peeled'.

His partner, Shirley Ferrari, was at his side when he died at their home in Totland, Isle of Wight, yesterday. He is also survived by his son, Richard, born to late wife Ianette, known as Jane.

Mr Taylor served in the RAF during the Second World War before training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London.

Following a brief stint as a stage actor, Mr Taylor became a radio and television presenter, acting as quizmaster on shows including This Is Your Chance, Tell The Truth and Ditto.

In the early Sixties he had a spell presenting a music show, Friday Spectacular, on Radio Luxembourg with Muriel Young. 

But it was as the face of Police 5 - a forerunner to shows such as Crimewatch - that Shaw established himself as a household name. 

In each five-minute episode, the first of which was aired in 1962, Shaw would present details of real crimes and appeal to members of the public to help solve them. 

The programme often yielded successful results. 

In 1986 he urged the public to help recover priceless medallions stolen from a 'distinguished lady' - who viewers were told was not the Queen - at Kew Palace, according to the Guardian. 

On another occasion, a burglar was arrested after the items he stole from a photographic college in Birmingham were shown on the programme. 

And in a 1985 episode of the show, the presenter was seen hunting through items at a Teddington Police Station as he tried to find property that had been stolen from his flat. 

He later presented a spin-off show called Junior Police 5, which was also known as JP5. 

The TV presenter was awarded an MBE in 1985. 

The presenter announced his semi-retirement in 1992 after the franchise was won by Meridian Broadcasting and retired to the Isle of Wight. 

Last year, then aged 89, Mr Taylor returned to British screens when Channel 5 revived the show with new presenters. 

He appeared on each programme for a short segment, reuniting with victims of theft with their property.
