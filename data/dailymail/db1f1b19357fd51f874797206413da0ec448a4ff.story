Mother of two Sally Adey was killed in the terror attack on the Bardo National Museum in Tunis, dying off wounds to her stomach and pelvis 

A retired British solicitor who was killed in a terror attack on a museum in Tunisia died from wounds to her stomach and pelvis, an inquest heard.

Mother-of-two Sally Adey, of Caynstall, near Shifnal, Shropshire, is one of more than 20 people who died after gunmen attacked tourists at the Bardo National Museum in Tunis.

The terror attack was the worst of its kind in Tunisia for 13 years.

Mrs Adey  had been on a Mediterranean cruise with her 52-year-old husband Robert, who survived the attack and had to identify his wife's body. 

Gunmen started shooting people after they were able to sneak into the museum on March 18, killing more than 20 people - including 17 tourists who had been on the cruise. 

Two gunmen who carried out the atrocity were subsequently killed in a firefight with security forces. 

On Sunday the Tunisian government confirmed that terror chief Khaled Chaieb, also known as Abou Sakhr Lokman, was killed overnight in an operation in the Gafsa region near the Algerian border.

He was one of the country's most dangerous terrorists and is believed to have been involved in the museum shooting. 

Coroner's officer Julie Hartridge, of Shrewsbury Coroners' Court, said retired solicitor Mrs Adey and her husband had left the luxury cruise ship MSC Splendour earlier that day before going into the museum on an excursion. 

She said a postmortem carried out on May 25 had established provisional cause of death as 'consistent with gunshot wounds to the abdomen and pelvis'.

Mr and Mrs Adey married in 1984 and have two children, Molly, 20, and Harry, 23. Mrs Adey is believed to have retired to have helped her children study for their A Levels and is thought to have recently returned to work full time.

After the attack ISIS based in Iraq and Syria claimed responsibility. 

Tunisian fighters make up a disproportionately high number of foreign recruits to ISIS in Syria, with as many as 10,000 having signed up.

CCTV footage of the shooting shows the gunmen roaming free around the museum carrying assault rifles and bags. At one point, they encounter another man with a backpack walking down a flight of stairs.

They briefly acknowledge each other and let the unidentified man walk free before unleashing the deadly attack in the country's largest museum.

The video also shows stills of the dead gunmen - named as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaou - who were killed in a firefight with security forces, including a picture indicating at least one was wearing an explosive belt.

Images released after the shooting show glass perforated with bullet holes and grenades discarded on the floor.

The lack of security at the country's largest museum has since been called into question and the brutality has led to large scale solidarity protests in Tunis, both at the weekend and in the immediate aftermath of the attack. 

Several people were arrested by Tunisian security forces after the attacks.  

The government now plans to deploy the army to major cities to bolster security following the shootings

On Saturday French President Francois Hollande confirmed Huguette Dupeu had died from her injuries following the attack.
