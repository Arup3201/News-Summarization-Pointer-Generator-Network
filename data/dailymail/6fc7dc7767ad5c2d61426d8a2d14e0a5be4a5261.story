Sydney siege survivor Harriette Denny has revealed her final thoughts from inside the Lindt Cafe, where she was forced to beg for survival at the hands of crazed gunman Man Haron Monis.

The 30-year-old cafe worker was among 18 hostages who were trapped inside the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place in December. She managed to escape before Monis began shooting.

In a snippet from an upcoming 60 Minutes interview, the 30-year-old Sunshine Coast woman said her last moments in front of the gunman were filled with appreciation for being able to experience the joy of being pregnant.

Pregnant Sydney siege survivor Harriette Denny has revealed her final thoughts from inside the Lindt Cafe, where she was forced to beg for survival at the hands of crazed gunman Man Haron Monis

'I was very grateful that I was able to experience the pure love and happiness of being pregnant,' she told reporter Liz Hayes. 

Ms Denny also discussed her fear of being shot by Monis, who went on to cause the death of Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson.  

'At that time I remember thinking, if he shoots me, as long as I don’t feel it or see it coming I’d be okay with it,' she said.

In a preview teaser of the upcoming interview, Ms Denny revealed each hostage was forced to beg Monis for their lives, which was when she realised one of the group was going to die. 

'We had to beg for our lives. He was going to shoot someone,' she said. 

In another clip, when asked 'at what point did you think you could die?', fellow hostage Fiona Ma replied: 'When he fired the first shot.'

60 Minutes has yet to announce when the program will go to air but the promotional videos are tagged 'Coming Soon'.

There was industry conjecture that the Nine Network could roll the ratings dice and put the top rating 60 Minutes against Channel Seven's coverage of the men's tennis final at the Australian Open next Sunday.

Channel Nine told Daily Mail Australia that: 'The siege story will include interviews with two staff members of the Lindt Café who were held hostage during the siege: Fiona Ma and Harriette Denny.'

'At least another six survivors will be interviewed for the story,' the network revealed to DMA.

During the siege, Harriette's frantic friends flocked to her Facebook page to relay their well wishes 

In extended interviews with 60 Minutes reporter Liz Hayes, the hostages are asked 'at what point did you think you could die?'. 'When he fired the first shot,' Fiona Ma answered

The Nine Network confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that 'Liz Hayes will be reporting. Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story'

'Liz Hayes will be reporting. Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story.'

Among those believed to have also been signed by Nine are Joel Herat and Jarrod Morton Hoffman, the sum total of all the interviews thought to be nudging $1 million.

It's also understood that Julie Taylor, 35, the barrister at Eight Selborne Chambers who is now 23 weeks pregnant, will be featured in the 60 Minutes special.

She was the hostage protected by her close friend Katrina Dawson, who died after she was hit by a bullet at the conclusion of the siege, and the one according to media analysts who has the most interesting story to tell.

There was industry conjecture on Tuesday that the Nine Network could roll the ratings dice and put the top rating 60 Minutes against Channel Seven's coverage of the men's tennis final at the Australian Open next Sunday

It's rumoured Nine could be paying up to $1 million for exclusive access to the stories of at least eight hostages who were kept captive for almost 17 hours in December at Martin Place

Sydney siege victim Marcia Mikhael is believed to have secured a deal of at least $350,000 to tell her story to the Seven Network, as the commercial rivals opened up their cheque books to secure survivors for their respective upcoming specials.

It's understood Channel Nine put in an offer of up to $300,000 for Marcia Mikhael to tell her horror story from inside the Lindt cafe on December 15th.

However, Ms Mikhael, 43, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her legs, opted to go with Seven after they submitted an even bigger offer, Daily Mail Australia understand

The networks have been so desperate to snare the best stories for their head-to-head broadcasts, they have been sending out their stars to 'door knock' the 16 survivors to convince them to tell-all.

Marcia Mikhael is carried from the Lindt cafe after suffering shrapnel wounds to her legs. She has been the subject of bids to tell-all by rival television networks and has vowed to use money from her interviews to set up a foundation for the victims of the Sydney siege and fellow hostages

Harriette Denny was among the last of five hostages to run out of the Lindt cafe as the siege reached its climax shortly after 2am. Television networks and magazines are vying for their stories have been willing to pay thousands

One of the first to escape, John O'Brien, 83, who was seen running from the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place with barrister Stefan Balafoutis, will also speak on the Seven program. He's rumoured to have signed on for $100,000.

Meanwhile, Channel Nine's 60 Minutes special is believed to feature up to 10 survivors who escaped after being held by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis for almost 17 hours. 

Daily Mail Australia understands the rival specials were set to air on Sunday February 1, which is the week when the television ratings season kicks off, rather than Australia Day as has previously been claimed. This would be after the coronial inquest starts on January 29.

However, confusing the matter for Seven, is the screening of the Men's Final at the Australian Tennis Open on that Sunday. Some media experts suggest that the Seven special could be screened immediately before the big match to counter any move by Nine.
