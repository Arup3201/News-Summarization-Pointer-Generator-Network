Aundra Akins, pictured here in 1997 aged 18, faces a further 40 years behind bars on top of his 27 year sentence

A man who murdered a Briton in a botched robbery 20 years ago in Florida has had 40 years added to his prison sentence.

Aundra Akins, who was just 14 when he gunned down holidaymaker Gary Colley in 1993, was imprisoned for 27 years in four years later - the maximum sentence he could receive as a juvenile. 

But today Akins appeared back in court where Judge Karen Gievers added 40 years onto his existing sentence.

The 34-year-old was told there was no hope of parole.

A court official at Jefferson County Court said: 'Aundra Akins was sentenced to 40 years to run consecutively to his previous sentence of 27 years for the murder of Gary Colley.'

Margaret Jagger, Mr Colley's girlfriend at the time, was also injured in the incident.

She travelled back to Montecito in Florida for yesterday's  hearing.

Speaking before the case, she told local news outlet WCTV: 'I didn't think I would have to come back again. 

'Both he and I have served time in different ways. My sentence will never end.'

Ms Jagger said Akins needs to show he can stay out of trouble, it was reported.

Akins reportedly told the judge today that at the time he did not comprehend the magnitude of what happened, but said he does now.

His mother was reported to have appeared at the hearing, and in asking the judge to release her son, she said: 'I understand what he did was wrong. I know he won't be no trouble to nobody.'

Akins' brother, cousin and uncle also testified, according to reports.

Now the same age as his victim was when he died, the murderer who acted as part of a gang in 1993 pleaded for forgiveness.

Akins pointed to his attainment of a GED qualification, trade certificates and his attendance of a Christrian retreat as proof of his changed ways.

He said: 'I'm not the kid I was before. I am a grown man and I really want to make a difference and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me,' but was refused the chance by Judge Gievers.

Remarkably, yesterday's developments took place on the eve of the tragedy's 20th anniversary.

Speaking of the landmark date, Ms Jagger from Bradford said: 'It's a big coincidence that this happened on this day, so it's very strange. It's 20 years tomorrow that Gary died. So it's pretty emotional'.

Mr Colley, Wilsden, West 
Yorkshire and Mrs Jagger were reportedly threatened on 
their way to Tampa in 1993 by a gang of youths, of which Akins was one.

The number of incidents that year prompted the Foreign Office to issue a warning to Britons thinking of 
travelling to the Florida, guidance which has since been lifted.
