Joe Hart has conceded his season has been 'not brilliant' as England's players put on a show for their junior colleagues today.

Roy Hodgson's team were in lockdown today as they prepared for two crucial World Cup qualifiers against San Marino (Friday) and Montenegro (next Tuesday), but the England Under 17 squad - and Sportsmail - were able to sneak in for a privileged view of their training session.

Hart, 25, admitted his own season has 'not been brilliant' in contrast to last year, when he won the Barclays Premier League title with Manchester City and participated in Euro 2012, as Ben Foster returned to the England fold to challenge for the No 1 jersey.

And although he welcomes the return of West Brom’s Foster after a two-year break from international football, Hart is determined to try and keep hold of the goalkeeping jersey.

'Is Foster good enough to push me? Yes, but I’ve felt that every time I’ve come away with England,’ said Hart. 'My job when I was first involved was to really push hard. We all train like we are going to play and push each other and it’s really good.

'If anyone of the three played, then we’d be in a strong position.'

However, Hart will not give up his position easily.

He said: 'I’m in that privileged spot at the moment. I didn’t dream of this spot because I didn’t think it would happen.

'I’m doing what I’ve always wanted to do, I love it, I’ll keep working and training hard if there are no keepers or 1,000 keepers.

'That No 1 spot is one I want to keep and last summer (Euro 2012) was a real high point in my career.“It was one of the best footballing things I’ve done. To play in a tournament like that is a dream.'

Hart concedes himself and City have struggled to maintain last season’s standards, but he still refuses to give up the title to Manchester United.

He said: 'My season has not been brilliant. It’s had its good times but it’s football. It’s what I love doing.

'I’ve enjoyed it, it’s been tough, things haven’t always gone my way. I’m enjoying the fight and getting back in there.

'Sometimes you take knocks, that’s football, you take opinions, but you’ve got to be strong.

'I feel strong, good, that I’m doing the right things and hopefully I can have a good end to the season.

'I understand you have your great nights and sometimes things don’t go the way you want. That’s the way it is.

'I’m my strongest critic but I would never bury myself. It’s pretty obvious when you make a mistake as a keeper, you don’t need to dwell on it too long. It’s out there.'

Hart added: 'With City, it’s not been last year that’s for sure. It’s been tough. We are not in the position we want to be in.

'We remain focused and hard on the case of what we need to do. We are still in one cup, a little further away than we would like to be in terms of the league.

'But we need to nail down that second spot and in doing that it will push us to really go for the title as well.

'You can’t not go for it. It’s a long way off but we’ve got an awful lot to fight for and it’s a big couple of months for us.'

Meanwhile, the World Cup fires are burning brightly for Scott Parker now he has finally recovered from the achilles injury that threatened his international future.

The Tottenham man returned from Euro 2012 requiring surgery on a long-term problem.

The operation kept him out until December, but after making 13 successive starts for Spurs, Parker is feeling good again.

And he is starting to train his sights on the greatest show on earth in Brazil next year.

'Now I am amongst it again, the fire rumbles in my belly to get there for Brazil,' said Parker.

'I have not had many massive injuries in my career but the ones you do have give you that hunger again.

'I need to take things one step at a time but, now I am in the squad, if I get my chance I need to take it.'

Midway through his first major tournament last summer, Parker did outline a theory that it could be his last.

Still only 32, it seemed an extreme assessment given his status as England’s most natural defensive midfielder.

Yet part of Parker’s thinking may have been formulated by the knowledge his troublesome Achilles injury, which flared up towards the end of last season, was going to need sorting out.

And, as the former West Ham man is acutely aware, nothing can be taken for granted in the recovery stages from such significant surgery.

'I didn’t really have any pain during Euro 2012 but there was a slight problem with my Achilles during the summer and in the end I needed to have an operation,' said Parker. 'And if you ask any player when they have been out for some time, doubts do cross your mind about when you are going to come back.

'There are long days when you are feeling unfit and everything seems a struggle. Then negative thoughts do set in.

'But once you are out of pain and on the road back towards playing again, your focus changes.'

Although Parker has not featured for his country since that disappointing penalty shoot-out defeat by Italy in Kiev last June, the experience of being in Poland and Ukraine has fuelled a passion to be part of another major tournament with England.

'I had a fantastic time at the Euros,' he said. 'It was a great experience for me and it did explode at quite a late age but I would love to be involved in a World Cup squad.

'A lot can happen between now and then. If I can stay fit and maintain my form hopefully I will have a chance.'
