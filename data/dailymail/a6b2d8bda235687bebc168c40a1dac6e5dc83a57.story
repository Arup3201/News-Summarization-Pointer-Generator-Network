For 70,000 people camped out in the middle of the Nevada desert, it has been a week of parties, dancing and debauchery.

But as Burning Man festival comes to its official close today it is time to pack up the Black Rock City campsite and head back to everyday life.

The festivities came to an end last night as the Temple of Grace was burned to the ground, following the traditional burning of The Man on Saturday.

Burning Man festival in Nevada came to an end last night as the Temple of Grace, a 70ft tall wooden sculpture, was burned to the ground

Before being set alight the wooden building had served as a place of prayer and reflection for the 70,000 people who attended the festival

The sculpture, including its five altars and walled courtyard, were engulfed in flames last night as Burning Man 2014 officially came to and end

It's all over: As the flaming remains of the Temple of Grace collapse into the dust of the Nevada desert, Burning Man festival officially comes to an end

For all the people who attended the festival, today marks the 'Monday of exodus' when the must leave the Black Rock City campsite and return to normal life

To the sounds of Johnny Cash, Black Sabbath and Joy Division, The Man was set on fire by festival officials in gothic-style robes. 

Money is banned at the event and all attendees must bring everything they will need for the week. But now it is time for them to return to the real world. 

And as the festival grows increasingly popular with young wealthy tech entrepreneurs from San Francisco, reports suggest the city's upmarket Mission district has been virtually deserted for the past week.   

The remote week-long rave in the Nevada desert - often described as 'where Mad Max meets Woodstock' - culminates each year with many of the statement artworks going up in flames, in a symbol of catharsis, reflection and new beginnings.

The Temple of Grace  is described as a 'sacred space for memorials, reflection, celebration, and to commemorate life transitions' on the makers' website.

David Best, the scupltor who made it, said: 'It is a special work of art given to the community, and is a spiritual refuge where thousands gather, each to engage with it in his or her own way. 

'The community comes to write their memorials and place tokens of their transitions, and it is burned at the end of the festival in a tradition of releasing them by the immolation of the temple.'

But while the last of the sculptures burning passed peacefully, this year's festival has been dogged by moments of controversy.

Black Rock Desert was doused in rain in the lead up to the gate's opening on August 25, forcing organizers to turn people away until the grounds had dried and the proper festival infrastructure could be put back together.

Next, hardcore 'Burners' complained the essence of what the festival represented - a society without currency built on sharing and freedom - had been ruined by an influx of tech billionaires that brought with them a five star experience, complete with luxury RV's, top shelf liquor and even bodyguards.
