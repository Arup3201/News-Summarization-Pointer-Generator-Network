When Volkswagen loaned out one of its top-of-the-range supercars to a UK police force, the firm must have been fairly confident the vehicle was in safe hands.

But as these pictures show, the car wasn't exactly returned in the same immaculate condition in which it arrived.

A Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officer was  taking the Volkswagen Golf R - which has a top speed of 155mph - for a test drive on a public road at 2am.

Destroyed: This is all that remains of a £40,000 top of the range Volkswagen which was loaned to Greater Manchester Police for a test drive

GMP had borrowed the vehicle for two days so its officers could get a feel for it before the force decided whether to buy some of the cars.

But, after skidding at a roundabout in Wharfside Way, Trafford Park, the unfortunate officer lost control of the £40,000 supercar.

The top-of-the-range vehicle was written off and the policeman, in his 40s, had to be rescued by firefighters.

The officer,  who is from the automatic number plate recognition intercept unit which patrols car crime hotspots, suffered spinal injuries and was taken to hospital, although he has since been discharged.

It is not known how fast he was travelling when the accident happened. The force has now suspended him from driving duties.

The car is the most powerful and fastest-accelerating Golf ever produced. It can accelerate from 0 to 62mph in just 5.7 seconds.

Top condition: How the £40,000 Volkswagen Golf R should look

A senior source said: 'The car was being tested and it went horribly wrong.

'Police do use public roads to test vehicles - the risk is reduced by the location and the time when this is done.

'Another officer in a powerful Audi had gone out on patrol with him at the same time - but was patrolling elsewhere when the accident happened.

'The Audi driver went to the scene immediately after the crash to help. The VW was on loan as the company are trying to sell them to the force.

Time to think: Greater Manchester Police is to review its policy of using public roads to test-drive cars following the crash

'It would appear there were icy conditions on the night it happened.

'It was being tested in the early hours and the car had been with the force for a couple of days.

'The idea was to get a few officers to get a feel for it - get a reasonable sample before deciding whether to buy them.'

Now the force, which had insured the car, is to review its policy of using public roads to test-drive cars.

No decision has yet been made by the force on whether to buy any Golf R.

In a statement GMP said: 'As a result of this incident Greater Manchester Police is currently reviewing its policy on officers test driving demonstration cars on public roads.

'That review is ongoing and it would be inappropriate to make any further comment.'
