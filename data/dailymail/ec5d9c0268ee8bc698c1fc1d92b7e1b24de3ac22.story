Many teenage girls spend a decent chunk of their beauty grooming time trying to hide all signs of baby hair on the forehead. 

But it seems it is now about to become a blessing, as baby hair is one of THE beauty trends for this summer.

As championed by the likes of FKA Twigs, Katy Perry and Rihanna, the short fluff around the top of the forehead is becoming a key accessory. 

FKA Twigs regularly makes a feature of her baby hair 

Katy Perry wore slicked down baby hair at the Givenchy show last month, while Rihanna is also a fan 

The style is worn gelled down on the forehead, styled into curls and wavy tendrils.

The cutting-edge pop stars aren't the only ones using the style though - several top name designers have also been using their look in their catwalk shows. 

In February, Riccardo Tisci sent his models down the runway at the Givenchy show with wet look baby hair.

The Caitlin Price show at London Fashion Week also used the look, but in a more other-worldy manner. 

Model's at the Givenchy show in February sported baby hair and facial jewellery 

The look also appeared it he DKNY SS15 show and last month's Caitlin Price show in London

The style isn't new - it has been adopted from black and Latina cultures in the US, who have used the look for many years. 

While the look appears to have the beginnings of a new trend among fashion designers, many have been unimpressed by its use in the shows. 

Twitter users commented in their hundreds on the look after it featured at Givenchy, with many voicing their distaste. 

One user called Sandi Cheeks  wrote: 'Givenchy had white models with slicked down "baby hairs" I don't know if that counts as embracing Afro-hair.' 

 Another called Bobola_O said: 'Not a fan of Givenchy's gelled baby hair look for their models. When has high fashion ever given a damn about appropriation?
