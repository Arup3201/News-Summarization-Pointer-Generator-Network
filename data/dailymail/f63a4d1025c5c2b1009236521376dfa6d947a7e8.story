Michael Owen believes Jordan Henderson will make a decent replacement as Liverpool captain when Steven Gerrard brings the curtain down on his time at Anfield, but feels he lacks the quality of the current leader.

Writing on his Sportlobster account, Owen describes Henderson as the only real candidate to take over the armband from the man who has been synonymous with Liverpool across the last 17 years.

'I think Jordan Henderson will captain Liverpool, judging on what (Brendan) Rodgers has been saying about him,' Owen explained. 'However, I am reluctant to compare Henderson to Gerrard, as I don't believe he is blessed with the talent of Stevie and I'm not sure he will be able to develop it.

'He's a quality player and talkative on the pitch. He plays every game and when you look around the pitch for candidates, there aren't too many obvious choices.

'I think he is a decent replacement as captain, but I wouldn't want to compare him with Gerrard because there aren't too many players in the same league as Gerrard in terms of quality.'

The former Liverpool striker Owen, who exited Anfield in 2004 for Real Madrid, hopes Gerrard can avoid injury and enjoy the twilight of his career at his boyhood club.

Gerrard missed Liverpool's 2-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday through a groin injury, but could return for the Capital One Cup semi-final clash with Chelsea at Anfield on Tuesday. 

'Gerrard's final game at Anfield will have a similar atmosphere to Sir Alex Ferguson's at Old Trafford,' Owen said. 'Hopefully, he will stay fit, healthy and involved for it. 

'It will be an unbelievable atmosphere and the fans will give Gerrard the perfect send off. It will be very emotional for Gerrard, as he hasn't known anything else apart from playing for Liverpool. Every game which is now played at Anfield, I am sure the fans will appreciate Gerrard even more.'

Owen added his name to the list  that includes Jamie Carragher and Phil Thompson in thinking more should have been done by Liverpool to extend Gerrard's tenure at the club.

'It is probably a nice move [to LA Galaxy], because he won't be upsetting anyone. He would've liked to stay on with Liverpool, but circumstances conspired against this,'Owen said.

'It is disappointing for everybody that something couldn't have been reached sooner to keep him at the club.'
