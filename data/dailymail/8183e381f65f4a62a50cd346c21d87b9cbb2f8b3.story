It takes the definition of a tablet to its extreme -  and definitely isn't something you'd want to use on the daily commute.

The HP Rove is a 20inch gadget with a 10-finger touchscreen and weighs almost a stone, tipping the scales at 12.27lbs.

Classed as a tabletop PC, the HP Rove runs the Windows 8 operating system and has a spring-loaded hinge on the back that can turn the handheld tablet into a monitor.

Panasonic claimed its 20inch tablet can display an entire magazine spread, and believes it could also be a hit with photography fans.

'Employing
Panasonic’s cutting-edge digital technology, the new tablet is designed
to create new value for users with a more realistic and intuitive 
operating environment than paper or a display,' the firm said.

'This tablet embodies the characteristics of printed media that existing personal or tablet computers cannot provide, such as texture rich rendering, natural hand-writing and a light weight and thinness for easy mobility.

However, while Apple and others concentrate of 7inch tablets such as the iPad mini, Panasonic hopes its screen will appeal to photography fans.

The 20-inch LCD panel delivers '4k' resolution (3840 x 2560, 9.83 million pixels), more than twice the horizontal and vertical resolutions of Full HD (1920 x 1080) and has a density of 230 pixels per inch.

It can display an A3-size
paper in almost full size, making it ideal to show content such as 
newspapers and magazines, as well as pictures with the same aspect 
ratio, according to Panasonic.

Weighing 2.4 kg (5.3 lbs) and 10.8 mm (0.4 inch) thick, the tablet is easy to carry.

'These unique characteristics will open up new ways for tablets to be used,' the firm said.
