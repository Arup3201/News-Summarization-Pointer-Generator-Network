The severe drought that has gripped the western United States for 14 years is literally changing the landscape.

In total the amount of water lost in the current drought - about 63 trillion gallons - is enough to cover the whole area in six inches (15cm) of water.

But more alarmingly, scientists have found that the loss of water  is causing the entire western US to rise up like an uncoiled spring.

Researchers in San Diego say a 14-year drought is raising the ground. Earth's crust in some locations has lifted by 0.16 inches in just 18 months. These maps of GPS points in the western United States show the changes in the landscape, with blue indicating a drop and yellow-red reflecting a rise.

The research was carried out by scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.

Since the year 2000, seven western states in the US has seen their driest periods in centuries.

These states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming

And scientists in California have warned that the region may be experiencing a century-long 'mega-drought'.

The warnings come after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years.

In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850.

However droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state.

Looking back over several thousand years, droughts have been known to last over a decade, and in some cases they can last a century.

And the patterns tend to repeat, meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future. 

Investigating ground positioning data from GPS stations throughout the west, the researchers Dr Adrian Borsa, Dr Duncan Agnew, and Dr Dan Cayan found that the water shortage is causing an 'uplift' effect,

This was up to 0.5 inches (15mm) in California's mountains and on average 0.15 inches (4mm) across the entire western US. 

From the GPS data, they estimate the water deficit at nearly 240 gigatons (62 trillion gallons), equivalent to a six-inch (15cm) layer of water spread out over the entire western U.S.

Results of the study, which was supported by the US Geological Survey (USGS), appear in the journal Science.

Dr Borsa, a Scripps assistant research geophysicist, kept noticing the same pattern over the 2003-2014 period while looking at data, namely that all of the stations moved upwards in the most recent years, coinciding with the timing of the current drought. 

Dr Agnew, a Scripps Oceanography geophysics professor who specialises in studying earthquakes and their impact on shaping the earth's crust, says the GPS data can only be explained by rapid uplift of the tectonic plate upon which the western US rests.

He adds, however, that the uplift has virtually no effect on the San Andreas fault and therefore does not increase the risk of earthquakes.

The uplift has been linked to the loss of 63 trillion gallons of water in the drought. Pictured is the Plate Boundary Observatory GPS station P466, located in the Inyo Mountains near Lone Pine, California. Its displacement data was used to determine water changes in the western US

For Dr Cayan, a research meteorologist with Scripps and USGS, the results paint a new picture of the dire hydrological state of the west.

'These results quantify the amount of water mass lost in the past few years,' said Dr Cayan. 

'It also represents a powerful new way to track water resources over a very large landscape. 

'We can home in on the Sierra Nevada mountains and critical California snowpack. 

'These results demonstrate that this technique can be used to study changes in fresh water stocks in other regions around the world, if they have a network of GPS sensors.'

When water is lost because of a lack of rain and snow, Earth's crust rises.

It typically sags in the winter and spring, weighed down by water, and it rises during the dry season in summer and fall, said Dr Borsa.

The authors removed those seasonal factors when analyzing about a decade of data from GPS stations within the National Science Foundation's Plate Boundary Observatory.

Last year, an area stretching west of the Rocky Mountains witnessed a 'massive uplift,' Dr Borsa explained.

The rise was most striking in the Sierra Nevada mountains and California coastal regions, but it was spread over the entire region, unlike previous years when some pockets have gone up and others went down.

'It's just amazing to us that this covers the entire western United States,' Dr Borsa said.

The loss of water since last year is equivalent to the annual loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet, according to the study.

The team hopes authorities use the measurements as a tool to measure the impact of drought. 

On 19 Aug 2014 Lake Mead near Las Vegas, Nevada (shown) dropped to it's lowest water level ever as the 14 year drought continued throughout the US. The drought is clearly visible with the white rock exposed on the side of the mountains in 'Black Canyon' district, seen here
