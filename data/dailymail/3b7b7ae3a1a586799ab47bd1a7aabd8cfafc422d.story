When people go on the customary estate agent's tour of a flat before deciding whether or not to rent it, they often prepare themselves for the unexpected.

But little could prepare one Australian couple for what they walked in on when they viewed a one-bedroom flat in Perth.

Lying in bed was the body of a 35-year-old Brazilian man who police believe had been there forÂ  days.

Rebecca Hayward and her boyfriend were shocked to find a dead body when they viewed a rental property in Perth, Australia (pictured)

The female real estate agent, who was 
showing the prospective tenants through the flat, stared in horror and 
burst into tears when the couple who found the body told her what was 
lying in the bedroom.

Not surprisingly, the inspection was cancelled - and now a row has broken out over why the real estate agency had not looked through the apartment before opening it up for viewing by prospective renters.

Rebecca Hayward, 18, who was with her boyfriend at the time, said that when she entered the one-bedroom flat there was an 'overpowering smell like dead cats'.

She told how she and her boyfriend were being shown through the living room by the agent when another couple discovered the dead tenant in the bedroom.

'The boyfriend of the other couple was walking into the bedroom when he turned, grabbed his girlfriend on the shoulders and turned her away,' Miss Hayward told the paper

'He came out and said there was something dead in there and I asked if it was a cat. But he said, no, it was a person, a human, a body.

'The real estate agent gave us all a funny look, but then when she saw the body she turned around and there were tears in her eyes.

'She said 'Everybody out!' and then went to the balcony and shouted to the other agent waiting outside.'

Miss Hayward said the woman called to her colleague: 'The viewing has been cancelled - don't let anybody else up here.'

Police said they believed the tenant, a Brazilian man, had been dead for a few days, but there were no suspicious circumstances.

Miss Hayward said she was glad she had not seen the body, but she and her boyfriend were struggling to cope with the trauma.

Ms Hayward has criticised the agency over their failure to check the flat prior to the viewing. Picture shows the lettings boards belonging to estate agents unconnected to the case in Perth, Australia

Although she 'felt bad' for the real estate agent she believed the flat should have been inspected before it was opened for general viewing.

Mr Graeme Baxter, managing director for the ACTON Hills agency, said the priority was for the welfare of the dead man's family. But he believed all proper procedures had been followed under the regulations.

'This incident has been a very traumatic process for all concerned,' said Mr Baxter.

Mr Baxter was supported by the Real Estate Institute of WA, whose president David Airey, said it appeared the agent had done nothing wrong.

'The relevant Act requires that agents give 'reasonable notice' if showing a buyer or prospective tenant through a leased property. 'In this case notice was given,' Mr Airey told the paper.

'Under the circumstances it's understandable that the agent turned up with clients when she did.

'She wasn't to know that the existing tenant had unfortunately died in the previous few days'

Now other agents have been told that their staff should check properties first before taking prospective buyers or tenants inside.
