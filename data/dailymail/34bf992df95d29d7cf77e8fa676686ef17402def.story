She was nearly 40 when she got married – and quickly found herself pregnant.

But actress Jenny Agutter is the first to admit that having a family was the making of her.

She said it was initially difficult to adjust after spending 15 years single – however the rewards are worth it.

‘You grow up when you let someone else into your life in marriage,’ the 62-year-old said. 

‘It’s a hard adjustment, coming to terms with other people’s realities and that you’re not going to do everything your way, although it’s wonderful to have someone else there.’

Miss Agutter was living in Los Angeles when she met Swedish hotelier Johan Tham at a Bath arts festival in 1989. They married a year later, with their son Jonathan arriving in December 1990.

Speaking to the Radio Times, she said: ‘In my 20s I felt much more maternal than in my 30s, but there was no one around to have a child with. 

'I thought about having one on my own, but knew I wouldn’t cope. I needed support.

‘I was less broody when I was in a position to have a child, but thrilled when I became pregnant.

‘However, they don’t tell you that, the moment you’re pregnant, your life is taken over. Everything you do, think and feel is affected.’

An established face on British screens thanks to her 1970 role as Roberta in The Railway Children and later parts in films such as An American Werewolf In London, Miss Agutter initially cut back on work to look after her new family. 

‘I didn’t want to compromise so that had to take precedence,’ she said.

But now she thinks there has been something of a renaissance for older actresses – and Miss Agutter has certainly benefited. 

Her most recent role is as Sister Julienne in Call The Midwife, which returns for its fourth series this week.

‘There’s a more mature audience to be catered for and great stories are being written,’ she said. ‘You no longer have to be young for ever, which is terrific.’

Lifting the lid on her time in America and her early career, she added: ‘Living alone [in LA] I made every decision and did things my way. I was never lonely.

‘I was self-centred, and it took me a long time to grow up because I didn’t do it with my peers.’

She revealed she managed to resist pressure from Hollywood producers to change her appearance – but said that turning 60 was an unpleasant milestone.

‘It was nothing to do with the age – more my own attitude in the past, thinking how old it made other people seem,’ she said.

As well as her son, the star also has two stepdaughters – one of whom has two children aged 11 and eight.
