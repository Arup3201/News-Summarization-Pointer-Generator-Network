A High Court judge gave the go-ahead for a gravely ill teenage boy to be given potentially life-changing treatment against the wishes of his Jehovah’s Witness mother.

The unidentified 13-year-old, known as T, was left facing profound disabilities after he contracted a disease which causes the immune system to mistakenly attack brain tissue.

Medics at the children’s hospital where he was treated said he urgently required plasma exchange treatment, described as the 'gold standard' for the condition.

However, his mother refused to give her consent because of her religious beliefs, meaning the hospital had to apply to the High Court for an order dispensing with her permission.

In a ruling earlier this month, but only now published, family judge Mr Justice Cobb said it was in the child’s best interests that the treatment go ahead.

'I recognise the powerful competing consideration prevents T’s mother, by virtue of her adherence to the tenets of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, from consenting to the treatment which I am invited to authorise,' he said.

'I recognise, and respect, the exquisitely difficult conflict with which the mother herself must be wrestling: trying on the one hand to be faithful to the tenets of her religion but facing the quite dreadful prospect of her son’s deteriorating health.

'In my judgment, and taking account of the risks advised, and the views of his mother, I am nonetheless clearly of the view that it is in T’s best interests that he should receive this treatment.'

The court heard the boy had been suffering with flu-like symptoms and was suspected to have tonsillitis, but his condition deteriorated rapidly.

Various treatments were attempted, but with 'regrettably limited effect', said the judge.

At the time of the hearing on July 17, he was being fed by tube and was only intermittently awake.

However, medics had managed to explain to him during one of his periods of wakefulness what was intended.

'When asked for his view as to the use of plasma exchange treatment, T is reported to have nodded his head in agreement with a "thumbs-up" to go ahead with this treatment,' said the judge.

He said the unanimous view of the boy’s medical team was that plasma exchange, which filters out harmful anti-bodies from the blood plasma, was the best form of treatment for him.
