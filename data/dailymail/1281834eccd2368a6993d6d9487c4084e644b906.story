Traditional county names like Middlesex and Cumberland could become a familiar sight again on England’s roads after ministers yesterday lifted a ban on displaying them on street signs.

In a move to mark St George’s Day, the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said planning laws were being changed to allow councils to display traditional county names alongside more modern creations.

Ministers are also consulting on a further change that would allow councils to erect stand-alone road signs telling motorists they have crossed an ancient boundary of counties like Huntingdonshire and Westmorland.

Signs such as this one, formerly of Middlesex, could have their old counties on them to celebrate heritage

Mr Pickles said the change in the rules would make it easier for England to celebrate its own rich heritage.

He said: ‘The tapestry of England’s counties binds our nation together, and is interwoven with our cultural fabric - from our cricket to our ales. Previous governments have tried to wipe the counties off the map, imposing bland administrative structures or alien euro-regions.

‘But I believe we are stronger as a nation when we cherish and champion our local and traditional ties.

'This government is proud to wave the flag of St George alongside both our county flags.

'Whatever one’s class, colour or creed, we should have pride in our English identities within the United Kingdom’s Union that binds us together.’ 

The boundaries of England’s 39 traditional counties have remain largely unchanged since the Domesday Book.

But successive waves of local government reorganisation, most notably Edward heath’s 1972 shaek-up, have threatened to blur their boundaries and wipe some off the map altogether.

Under existing laws the use of anything other than modern local authority names is classed as an advertisement.

Stand-alone road signs may also be erected to highlight ancient boundaries such as Huntingdonshire

Blackpool cannot declare its Lancashire 
heritage on signs because it is now a unitary authority. Similar rules 
prevent Poole saying it is in Dorset or Torquay declaring it is in 
Devon.

TV astrologer Russell Grant, founder of the Association of British Counties, welcomed the announcement.

The former Strictly Come Dancing Star said: ‘This is great news for counties like my own, Middlesex. We lost our county council in 1965, but our county continues to exist.

'Some London boroughs like Hounslow have actively supported Middlesex signs on their boundaries, and Brentford Chamber of Commerce are keen to proclaim the town as the historic county town of Middlesex.

'These common sense changes will give local councils and communities the confidence to promote historic local heritage and identity.’

Ministers believe reviving the use of Britain’s traditional county names could foster a sense of national pride and boost tourism.

A source said: ‘They provide an instant means of reference to different parts of the country, to a set of cities, towns and villages, to distinctive scenery, architecture and wildlife, to particular industries and pastimes, accents and dialect, tourist attractions and so on.

‘A large literature focuses on each of the counties - they give their names to clubs and societies, to teams people play for, to regiments they serve in.

'And they often provide a family link with past generations.’

Under the new planning guidance on advertising, councils will be deemed to have the power to use traditional county names on signs provided they do not create dangerous roadside clutter.

The guidance states: ‘Local authorities may install signs indicating the boundary of a historic or traditional county on their land. Depending on circumstances, such signs may benefit from deemed consent.

‘Authorities need to bear in mind how such sign-posting can benefit the local economy and reflect this through the decision-taking process, where such signs are appropriate and locally-supported.’

However, the move comes just days after Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin warned councils to cut down on the excessive number of signs cluttering Britain’s roads.

Regulations are set to be tightened up after research by the Department for Transport found the total number of road signs has more than doubled in the last 20 years to 4.5 million.
