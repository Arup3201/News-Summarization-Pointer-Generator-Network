The culprit who sparked a murder scare after leaving 'a trail of blood' along a jetty that was visible on Google Maps was today revealed to be a wet dog called Rama.

The 'blood' seen in the image was in fact a trail of water left by the dog after it went for a swim.

Rama's hounding down has ended days of guesswork as to whether a crime scene had been captured by aerial photos.

The mystery aerial shot: This image showing what appeared to be a grisly crime scene in a park in the city of Almere, Netherlands, sparked days of speculation as to what it could really be

The satellite shot from Google maps had sparked online speculation that a vicious crime may have taken place and gone undetected in the Dutch city of Almere.

First posted on Reddit, it shows what looks like a trail of blood apparently leading on to a waterside jetty jutting into a lake in Beatrixpark, in the heart of the city.

At the end of the trail it appears as though two people are standing over a dead body, preparing to throw it into the water. But investigations carried out by fans of the popular social news site revealed that the 'crime scene' was in fact nothing of the sort.

Eagle-eyed internet sleuths used a little-known technique to zoom right into the image to reveal that it was in fact a soggy dog which had left what looked like the bloody trail.

And now the dog's owner has come forward to tell of her surprise when she realised the picture, which went viral online, in fact showed her and a friend out playing catch with her dog, Rama.

'When I saw the picture I realised, "it's my dog". He loves the water,' she told The Sun. 'He jumps off the end of the jetty, swims around to the bridge and runs down to the edge again.

'It's hilarious that everyone thought it was murder. But it's great he's now world famous.'

Detailed analysis: Once one Reddit user revealed how fellow laptop sleuths could zoom in more closely to the image posted by ncav, they began annotating the image to attempt to prove the wet dog theory

Even more detailed analysis: Another Reddit user posted this image which attempted to explain what was going on in the ambiguous-looking scene in even greater detail

The city of Almere where the bizarre Google Maps image was captured is Holland's newest city and 
home to more than 193,000 people. The first homes were only completed in 1976.

The
 image was originally posted on April 12 by a Reddit user named ncav, 
with the caption: 'A murder near my house on Google Maps, link in 
comments.'

Inside the comments attached to the post, the user added that he and his friend had told the police about the apparent crime.

Further commenters then sought to debunk the murder hypothesis.

The investigation really took off when Redditor xythrowawayy sharedÂ a little-known trick which allowed fellow users to zoom in further than anyone had previously managed.

It
 involved grabbing the URL usually used to share the map via email or 
social media and changing the number at the very end of the link from 22
 to 23.

'If Google Maps has imagery at that higher zoom level, it will show it to you,' added xythrowawayy.

But it was Bennyboy1337 who was the first to work out that what the image shows is in fact a dog which has left a wet trail along the jetty's wooden deck, and not a body surrounded by blood.

'Looks like a dog got out of the water and shook itself dry, then walked off the dock while dripping water, the wet wood looks much darker in colour,' wrote Bennyboy1337.

'You can clearly see where the dog shook, walked off the deck, then walked back to his owner on a separate lighter coloured path on the bottom.'

Two users on the site then annotated the zoomed-in image to point out more details that appeared to confirm the wet-dog theory.

A third then zoomed out a little to point out that there were other people walking right past the supposed bloody crime scene, while another used Google Maps distance measuring tool to estimate that the 'body' is just 3.5ft long.

'This is either a dog or a midget murder,' quipped Penguinpoop4.
